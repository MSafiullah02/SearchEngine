Moreover, their specificities and biological effects can now be readily manipulated using standard molecular biological techniques. In most cases mammalian antibodies are perfectly adequate. Unfortunately, their involvement in the immune response and immune-mediated pathologies along with a high degree of conservation among mammals can, however, make them susceptible to unwanted interactions with conserved proteins, which can in turn hamper their use in certain approaches.",

IgY is the major low molecular weight immunoglobulin in oviparous animals. This type of antibody has distinctive properties which can be exploited in various ways in research, diagnostics and therapy. One important advantage arises from the phylogenetic distance and genetic background that distinguishes birds from mammals. This improves the likelihood that an immune response will be elicited against antigens or epitopes that may be non-immunogenic in mammals. The deposition of IgY into the egg yolks of the immunized bird then provides an elegant source of polyclonal immunoglobulins. Since polyclonal IgY can be recovered from the eggs of laying hens for prolonged periods, this approach provides a long-term supply of substantial amounts of antibodies. In addition, such antibodies exhibit biochemical and structural features, which can render them superior in virtually all types of immunoassays, especially those designed to detect molecules in specimens like mammalian blood or serum [4], [5].",

In the chicken, only a single functional V and J segment is present in the light and heavy chain gene loci. As a result, diversification of the avian immune repertoire is introduced into the rearranged V(D)J segments by gene conversion using pseudo V genes as donors. As will be seen, this greatly simplifies the construction of combinatorial recombinant antibody libraries while the selective power of phage display provides a way of accessing unique binders.",

IgY has a slightly higher molecular mass (approximately 167 kDa) than its mammalian counterpart [16] due to the presence of four constant- and one variable Ig heavy chain domains. The nucleotide sequence of the chicken upsilon (\u03c5) heavy chain [17] reveals that as with the more ancient amphibian IgY [18], [19], the avian molecule contains a domain (C\u03c52) which is conserved in mammalian IgE, but was condensed to form the flexible \u201chinge\u201d region in mammalian IgG [17]. An orthologous domain must therefore have existed in the IgY-like ancestor prior to duplication and subsequent divergence from the mammalian lineage.",

            "text": "In mammals, IgG forms immune complexes and facilitates opsonisation, activates the complement system and provides protection for the foetus upon transport across the placenta. IgE can sensitize effector cells and mediates anaphylactic reactions [20]. IgY appears to combine mammalian IgG- and IgE-like functions since it not only provides defence against infections [21], but may also mediate anaphylaxis [22]. In contrast to mammals, basophils are much more numerous in birds than mast cells [23] and antibody-dependent hypersensitivity and fatal systemic anaphylaxis [22], [24], [25] are mainly mediated by these cells [26]. This constitutes indirect evidence for the presence of IgY receptors on effector cells. IgY binds to monocytes with IgG-like kinetics [27], despite its putative IgE like structure as predicted from the chicken \u03c5 heavy chain primary sequence [17]. Recently, the chicken leucocyte receptor complex (LRC) was analysed and four major types of chicken Ig-like receptors (CHIR) were identified: CHIR-A, activating receptors displaying two extracellular C2-type Ig-domains, CHIR-B, inhibitory receptors also displaying two C2-like Ig-domains, and two types of CHIR-AB with one or two C2-like Ig-domains, which are reported to have bifunctional potential, since they display features of both inhibitory and activating receptors [28], [29]. So far, CHIR-AB1 and its recently identified homologues are the only receptors in the LRC of known specificity [30]. It functions as a classical Fc receptor expressed on chicken B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells [31]. In contrast to IgG and IgE receptors, CHIR-AB1 binds in a similar way as Fc\u03b1RI or FcRn with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Its affinity is comparable with the values reported for IgA binding to its receptor [32]. In contrast to mammalian IgG or IgE the CHIR-AB1 binding site was mapped to the upsilon heavy chain domains 3 and 4 (C\u03c53/C\u03c54) interface, a finding that together with the phylogenetic relationship of the antibodies and their receptors indicates a substantial shift in the nature of Fc receptor binding during evolution [33], [34]. A specific interaction between CHIR-AB1, which provides an inhibitory motif in its cytoplasmic tail and the Fc portion of IgY was shown to enhance calcium release in a chicken B cell line expressing CHIR-AB1 and the common activating \u03b3-chain [31]. The activation required aggregation of IgY suggesting that immune complexes are required to trigger a response [31]. By comparing CHIR-AB1-like sequences in databases, 18 homologues of CHIR-AB1 have been identified and cloned. These comprised non-IgY-binding and IgY-binding isoforms displaying different affinities [30].",

            "text": "An additional FcR-related gene designated Gallus gallus FcR (ggFcR) was recently identified [35]. The receptor which selectively binds IgY consists of four extracellular C2-set Ig domains. Surprisingly, ggFcR is closely related to chicken LCR encoded genes, but is located on chromosome 20 distinct from the LCR and FcR gene clusters. Recently a chicken yolk sac IgY receptor (FcRY) responsible for IgY transport from yolk to the embryonic circulation was characterized as a homologue of the mammalian phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), a member of the mannose receptor family [36]. Deposition in the yolk however is mediated by another receptor not yet cloned [10] the specificity of which has been addressed by different approaches. One factor restricting the deposition of IgM and IgA in the yolk appears to be their polymeric nature [37]. The Fc region structure may also be important since anseriform species like ducks preferentially incorporate full-length IgY into the egg yolk over the truncated isoform IgY \u0394Fc [38]. Site-specific mutagenesis experiments using mammalian IgG sequences and extrapolation of this information to the upsilon heavy chain suggested the C\u03c52/C\u03c53 interface, especially residues 362\u2013365, and positions 550\u2013553 within C\u03c54 as essential for the interaction with the receptor [39]. Besides its function and interaction with Fc receptors, IgY differs from IgG in a variety of aspects which are more directly attributable to the molecule itself. As mentioned earlier, the phylogenetic distance between the avian immune system and mammalian proteins most likely increases the immune response towards the respective antigens. This means that IgY can often be raised against epitopes on highly conserved proteins when other mammals fail to provide an immunological response [40], [41]. The extent to which the overall antibody affinities of mammalian IgG and IgY relate to each other is still under investigation but monoclonal IgY antibody fragments generally exhibit reactivities at least comparable to those of IgG (unpublished observations).",

            "text": "Compared to mammalian IgG IgY is lacking the flexible hinge region and, thus, thought to be a more rigid immunoglobulin. This hinge-less structure is also found in mammalian IgE. IgY therefore exhibits structural features of both mammalian IgE and IgG, a finding also supported by a structural analysis of the IgY Fc portion [42]. Potentially reduced molecular flexibility might be associated with decreased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation or fragmentation. Nevertheless, IgY can be fragmented by papain or trypsin [43]. IgY, like mammalian IgG, is reasonably stable and can be stored for several months under standard conditions [44]. A serious limitation of IgY for therapeutic applications, however, is its reduced stability at low pH [44], [45]. In contrast to IgG the antigen binding activity of IgY decreases significantly under acidic conditions. As demonstrated by circular dichroism analyses, loss of activity of chicken IgY is accompanied by significant conformational changes, a fact attributed to fewer intramolecular disulphide linkages than, for example, rabbit IgG [46].",

One of the most frequently used procedures involves protein precipitation with ammonium sulphate, dextran sulphate or polyethylene glycol (PEG). A particularly efficient method comprises two successive precipitations by using 3.5% PEG to remove any lipids, followed by 12% PEG to precipitate the IgY.

The elution conditions are very mild compared with conventional methods used to purify antibodies, such as protein A, G, or L, none of which bind to IgY. Nevertheless, purification strategies or polishing steps based on affinity ligands might be helpful, in particular when high purity is desired. Anti-IgY antibodies and synthetic ligands [55], [56] are available, but this spectrum of reagents could be broadened by using soluble IgY receptor constructs or other affinity molecules as affinity medium. For instance, SSL7, the superantigen-like protein 7 from Staphylococcus aureus can be used for affinity purification of IgY (unpublished data). Additionally, recombinant expression of CHIR in mammalian cells and in Escherichia coli is highly efficient and can potentially provide a highly homogeneous protein fraction (unpublished data).",

Both avian IgY and chimeric IgY with avian constant domains and murine binding moieties have recently been produced [59], [60].

Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) binds transiently to most domains of the Ig heavy chain (CH) and some variable regions of the light and heavy chain (VH and VL) [61], [62]. CH1 provides a site for covalent attachment of CL and interacts stably with BiP in the absence of light chains [63]. Pronounced differences in the amino acids sequences within the antibody constant domains of antibodies from birds and mammals and the potential loss of specific interaction sites for chaperones with the nascent immunoglobulin chains might conceivably affect the efficiencies with which mammalian cells can secrete avian antibodies. For instance, IgY was found to be more efficiently secreted than IgG1, possibly as a result of less stringent control by the ER secretion machinery [60]. Since having efficient and economic ways of producing antibodies is always desirable, yields might in some cases be improved by using the binding moieties from pre-existing murine hybridomas to generate chimeric IgY. Moreover, the enormous diversity of the synthetic antibody libraries available today means that immune animals are not necessarily needed to derive suitable binders. Indeed, frameworks of synthetic human [64] and avian [65] variable regions have been successfully converted to their IgY derivatives and produced in eukaryotic hosts.",

Carbohydrate analysis of native IgY revealed mono-glucosylated oligomannose type oligosaccharides, oligomannose type oligosaccharides and biantennary complex type oligosaccharides [66]. The first two of these have been reported as being the major glycoforms in IgY from different species [66], [67], [68] and are attributed to the C\u03c53 glycosylation site [69]. Additionally, a terminal sialic acid was identified in native IgY. No significant differences between the overall glycosylation pattern of native and recombinant IgY produced in mammalian cells could be detected using common lectins, thereby confirming that recombinant IgY from this source closely resembles the native immunoglobulin [60]. However, recombinant production of IgY in different hosts is likely to result in variable glycosylation patterns. As a result, the biochemical properties of recombinant and native IgY are likely to differ. Since glycosylation of immunoglobulins is not only implicated in a variety of physiological mechanisms but also influences their physicochemical behaviour, recombinant IgY may not always be suitable for all the potential applications envisaged for it.",

            "text": "Applying combinatorial approaches in biology and chemistry demands high efficiency and where possible, simple and straightforward techniques. Chicken therefore provide an ideal basis for generating large immune antibody fragment libraries as compared to most mammalian species [134]. The inherent complexity of mammalian diversification mechanisms can make it difficult to recover antibody sequences. This is especially true in humans and mice. The genetic organization of these mammals is based on the modular use and recombination of a broad panel of V, D, and J segments which are further diversified by several different mechanisms. Therefore, accessing and amplifying mouse and human repertoires requires a large set of different oligonucleotides to cover the entire set of V segments which is prone to preferential amplification of high abundance transcripts and the potential loss of particular V segments during PCR. In chickens, genetic diversification is achieved differently. Both the heavy and light chain loci consist of single functional V and J genes, (and D segments for the heavy chain) that are rearranged using conventional V(D)J recombination mechanisms. In order to generate a large, diverse antibody repertoire and to allow affinity maturation upon antigen priming avian species utilize a unique mode of DNA recombination, termed gene conversion (reviewed in [135]). In this process, short DNA segments from non-functional V pseudogenes located upstream are inserted into the rearranged gene. These modulate the primary structure and, hence the binding characteristics of the resulting immunoglobulin. However, the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends of the rearranged gene remain unaltered thus allowing the diversity of the chicken humoural immune system to be recovered by the use of only two pairs of primers.",

In another study the identification of underrepresented serum proteins and disease marker candidate discovery was simplified when specific IgY was used as a blocking reagent [156], [157].

In particular, approaches using immunoglobulins as bioactive molecules to capture or detect the analyte are often affected by heterophilic antibodies and/or high levels of non-specific binding. In addition, antigen-independent specific binding via immunoglobulin Fc receptors or lectins and non-immunoglobulin-based interactions, e.g. those mediated by complement factors [158], can result in false-positive and false-negative results [159], [160]. As recently summarized [159], estimates of the prevalence of assay interference by heterophilic antibodies range from 1 to 80% [161], [162], [163], [164], [165], [166]. A more thorough analysis of over 11,000 sera in an anti-CEA assay format revealed that about 4% of the results were potentially false [167]. Approaches to eliminate heterophilic antibody interference include the removal or inactivation of interfering immunoglobulins, e.g. by precipitation with PEG [168], the use of various buffer additives [167], or the modification of assay antibodies by proteolytically removing of Fc fragments [167], [169]. It is unlikely, however, that a single method can resolve these problems [170]. Alternatively, recombinant modifications like the humanization of animal derived antibodies [171] and the use of single-chain fragments [172] can be useful. Other possibilities include shifting to non-immunoglobulin affinity systems [173] such as affibodies or aptamers. Each of these approaches is of course likely to suffer from the particular drawbacks inherent in these molecules.",

Work in our laboratory has shown that monoclonal and polyclonal IgY antibodies bind neither to mammalian Fc\u03b3 receptors CD64 and CD16A [175] nor to the human high affinity IgE receptor, despite similarities in the amino acid sequences of human IgE and avian IgY. The low degree of relationship between mammalian and avian Fc receptors [27], [31], [176], [177] explains these findings.",

Although various hen-egg proteins were implicated in allergies by both in vivo and in vitro investigations as early as 1912 [178], reports on the occurrence of human IgY-specific antibodies are scarce and are focussed on IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. One study [179] demonstrated that 15 in 28 egg-allergic patients exhibited specific IgE binding against one or more egg yolk-derived antiviral chicken immunoglobulins. In contrast, according to another study the overall allergenic potential of IgY in animal models appears to be low [180]. To what extent IgY-specific antibodies of IgG, the isotype that is most relevant in immunological analyses, occur in individuals sensitized to egg yolk remains to be established.",

Instead, artificial substitutes for human reference sera specific for virtually any protein of interest could easily be established (unpublished results) by using avian polyclonal or (under certain circumstances) monoclonal IgY complexed with the IgY-specific CHIR-AB1 ectodomain which has been genetically fused to human Ig Fc domains, as the binding moiety.",
