For subtropical high-density cities such as Hong Kong, in order to mitigate the negative effects of the urban heat island, good ventilation is required for healthy living and comfortable thermal sensations [2,3]. After Hong Kong was hit by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), from which many people died in 2003, the Hong Kong government started discussions among various government departments and consulted relevant professional institutes and stakeholders regarding the standards, scope, and mechanism for application of an air ventilation assessment (AVA) system to improve the urban wind environment [4].",

Meanwhile, a new chapter on ventilation assessment was also incorporated into the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (HKPSG). These two documents, setting out the framework and requiring all major government departments to include AVA as one of their planning and design considerations, were the first to address weak wind problems [5]. Unlike the guidelines of many countries for dealing with wind gust problems, the Hong Kong AVA is specifically designed to deal with weak wind conditions in congested urban areas under a hot and humid subtropical climate [4]. The world's first weak-wind urban AVA system has been applied in Hong Kong in the city's design and planning practices for more than a decade.",

One possible cause is that the current AVA methodology adopts the neutral assumption for the atmospheric boundary condition, which is justified only when mechanical turbulence has a greater influence on ventilation than buoyancy-induced turbulence under high background wind speed. However, the neutral assumption does not adequately represent the actual situation, as the daytime atmospheric boundary is likely to be unstably stratified, particularly under clear sky and low wind conditions [7]. More importantly, the most crucial situations for urban ventilation are those in which only a low-speed background wind is present. The neutral assumption that supposes that buoyancy-induced turbulence has only a minor influence on ventilation is not true in such a condition.",

But very few studies have addressed the effects of diabatic conditions on urban ventilation. A study of thermal effects on turbulence coherent structures found that when thermal effects are included by surface heating in large-eddy simulation (LES), the spanwise flow is stronger within an idealized building array compared to the neutral case [16]. Another LES study suggested that roof heating, in combination with building walls and ground heating, is important in the strength and location of the canyon vortex [17]. Both of these LES studies used idealized urban geometries (cubical building arrays). Using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of two simplified Hong Kong city models, Yang and Li pointed out that airflow in street canyons is dependent on thermal stratification when wind speed is small relative to the buoyancy force [18]. However, how pedestrian-level ventilation under thermal stratification differs from neutral conditions in a realistic urban complex is indistinct.",

When thermal conditions, specifically unstable stratification, are considered in ventilation, there will be additional challenges: First, a larger model domain is required to catch the larger turbulent structures in unstable simulations than in the neutral condition, while the grid size has to be kept small to sufficiently resolve the street-level air flows [19]. Second, special attention should be paid to the lateral boundary conditions to ensure that they will not artificially modify the wind environment within the assessment region. For instance, the radiative outflow condition in the non-cyclic boundary requires a positive outflow at all times [20,21]. Therefore, while a weak background wind is provided for generating buoyancy-driven turbulence, extra model domain is needed on the leeward side of the city. This also requires extra computational cost. Third, more uncertainties will be incorporated in the estimation of initial thermal conditions. Heat fluxes are more difficult to monitor than winds. In such cases, validation of model results can be another obstacle.",

The estimated result suggests that neutral conditions occur with a very low probability of about only 2%; even the weak unstable class C occurs less than 20% of the time. During most of the daytime (about 80%), atmospheric stratification in urban Hong Kong can be classified as moderate and strongly unstable (classes B and A). However, the estimation may not be very accurate due to some deficiencies of this methodology. There are three limitations to the use of the Pasquill stability classification scheme: First, the Pasquill scheme is widely used mainly because it requires only routine meteorological data, but it was originally developed in the United Kingdom at a location some miles from the coast, and should be restricted to the insolation values and climate conditions there. It has been found that various stability classification methods result in large discrepancies [23]. Second is the restriction of local observations to Hong Kong. HKO is one of the two sites that have cloud cover observations (the other site is Hong Kong International Airport). It is located in a small park that is surrounded by a high-density urban area in Tsim Sha Tsui (Fig. 1), with an altitude of 32 m above mean sea level. KP is surrounded by a relatively larger green space on a small hill with an altitude of 65 m on the Kowloon Peninsula. The uncertainties introduced to the classification of stability by such environmental conditions are difficult to control. Finally, there is no information available as to how the parameters of strong, moderate, and slight should be chosen when the Pasquill scheme is used locally in Hong Kong.",

The size of the recycling area is 480 m by 1 km, and it is 520 m away from the city area. The 520 m \u00d7 1 km buffer zone between xrecycle and the city helps prevent the blocking effects of the buildings from reaching the recycling area, while the 1 km \u00d7 1 km buffer zone on the leeward side of the city helps ensure a positive outflow.

Under such low wind conditions, the influence of buoyancy-induced turbulence becomes important, and ventilation will depend on the balance between thermal forcing and wind forcing. In addition, if high wind speed is used, more computational time will be needed because the time step has to be shorter. But a low background wind speed also requires a large buffer zone behind the city to ensure a positive outflow (Fig. 5). The time step lengths are optimized in the LES model. In the LES experiments described below, the mean time step lengths are between 0.34 s (for the unstable cases) and 0.68 s (for the neutral case). A 1 h precursor run, with a horizontal domain of 240 m \u00d7 240 m and the same height as the main run, is promoted for generating initial turbulent inflow profiles. The total simulation time for the main run is 2 h. The first hour is excluded in the analysis of the results, as the turbulences need this time to spin-up. The simulated results of the second hour are averaged for analysis.",

Other simulations feature an unstable stratification realized by a prescribed homogeneous potential temperature of 300 K below 800 m and a capping inversion layer above with a potential temperature gradient of 1 K per 100 m, which is a general temperature setup for simulations of a convective boundary layer. More importantly, prescribed heat fluxes are generated from building rooftops and side walls. As in a realistic urban area with rather complex urban form, the thermal conditions and their balance with the velocity field are difficult to quantitatively decide by heat flux generation in the numerical simulation. Therefore, we carry out a set of test runs, namely T0, T1, T2, and T3, with various prescribed rooftop and side wall heat flux settings, as listed in Table 3\n. We deem that the approaching winds are always under neutral stratification due to general high wind speeds and very small surface roughness over open sea waters.

With a very small surface roughness over open sea waters [58] and a relatively high anemometer elevation (83 m above mean sea level) [59], data collected at Waglan Island are considered to be representative of the boundary-layer wind approaching Hong Kong. Hourly wind speed observed at Waglan Island at 4 p.m. on 19 September 2006 is 6.4 ms-1. The wind speeds in Table 2 are divided by this value to gain the field-measured VR.",

Hence, street orientation seems to be less important for urban ventilation under unstable conditions due to larger wind direction variance compared to neutral conditions. The limitation of this is that the relationship between ventilation and \u03bbf is hard to justify given that only one wind angle is tested. Fig. 15b further demonstrates a scatter plot and regression between VR and the ground coverage ratio (\u03bbp), which is defined as the ratio of ground area that is covered by the building to the site area. This parameter is computed using the same averaging areas and moving-window algorithm that were used in the calculation of \u03bbf. More importantly, \u03bbp is independent of wind direction. Fig. 15 suggests that the correlation between VR and \u03bbp is higher than that between VR and \u03bbf in both the neutral and unstable cases. The VR under neutral conditions gives a correlation of \u22120.51 with \u03bbp, which is still larger than \u22120.4 in the unstable case (Fig. 15b). One possible cause is that stronger convective motion (Fig. 12) and greater wind direction variance (Fig. 14) in the unstable case reduce the effects of urban form and urban density on ventilation. Nevertheless, these results are still restricted by the limited domain and the complexity of the realistic urban morphology tested in the simulations. Future studies using parametric urban forms and urban densities while considering more input wind directions should be conducted to expand the preliminary result of this study.",

VRs in the unstable LES case are in line with field measurements, while those in the neutral case are close to the wind tunnel tests. Overall ventilation under unstable conditions is found to be better than that under neutral conditions. Current AVA practices under the neutral assumption are conservative if the actual situation includes an unstably stratified boundary layer. Enhanced convective motion due to surface heating in unstable conditions is the main reason the neutral assumption can be conservative. Moreover, stronger wind direction variance under unstable conditions results in weaker correlation between VRs and frontal area indices than under neutral conditions.
