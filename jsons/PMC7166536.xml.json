Fever and influenza\u2010like symptoms were the predominant presenting features but diarrhea, nausea and vomiting were frequently observed.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Diarrhea was an important problem because SARS coronavirus could be identified in stool in up to 100% of cases on day 10 in one study,\n5\n and up to 70 days after onset of symptoms in another study.\n7\n Although stool culture for SARS coronavirus failed,\n7\n the possibility of oral\u2013fecal transmission became imminent.\n8\n Amoy Gardens was one of the most densely populated private housing estates in Hong Kong and in March 2003, 321 residents from 15 blocks had contracted the disease. The source was traced to a 33\u2010year\u2010old patient with watery diarrhea and it was postulated that the virus was spread via a faulty sewage system.\n8\n Recently, coronavirus protein was identified in the esophagus, stomach and small intestines by immunohistochemical staining\n9\n and in colon by culture and electron microscopy,\n7\n suggesting a high intestinal tropism of the SARS coronavirus. Recently coronavirus\u2010related proteins or toxins were postulated to be the cause of diarrhea.\n7\n In Hong Kong, the Medical and Geriatric Unit of Princess Margaret Hospital was the quarantine hospital taking care of SARS patients and by 26 May 2003, we had treated 578 patients. The present study was conducted to study the clinical and demographic data of SARS patients with diarrhea in a retrospective manner.",

The mean frequency of bowel movements plus 1 SD is shown in Fig. 2. The mean onset time of diarrhea was 7.5 \u00b1 2.8 days after onset of fever. Up to 5% of patients had diarrhea in the first week and the peak incidence of 17% occurred on day 12. The pattern for patients living in Amoy Gardens Estate was similar to that of patients living in other areas. The proportion of patients receiving diphenoxylate/atropine sulfate, kaopectate and hyoscine methobromide was 12.2%, 12.2% and 6.1%, respectively, for 1\u20136 days. The mean lowest potassium level in the diarrhea group (2.5 mmol/L) was also significantly lower than that in the group without diarrhea (2.8 mmol/L; P < 0.001).

In two papers, diarrhea was reported as the presenting symptom in 5.8%\n7\n and 6%\n2\n of patients, respectively. Diarrhea was also noted in 3% of patients on the first day of admission in the present series, based on hospital inpatient records. We also came across several patients who had high fever and frequent watery diarrhea on presentation. They had minimal cough and CXR was completely normal. They were suspected to have SARS because of positive history of contact with other SARS patients. Small consolidation was noted only in high\u2010resolution CT thorax. A high index of suspicion was needed in these patients.",

All patients improved by day 13 in that study. The patients with diarrhea in the present cohort also followed a similar pattern as shown in Fig. 2. We noted that female patients and residents of Amoy Gardens Estate were associated with diarrhea, and loglinear analysis showed that there was no significant interaction between these two factors. Several hypotheses might explain these findings. Different genomes of the coronavirus from different sources might lead to different clinical manifestations of the viral infection. Host factors such as sex might also account for the difference. More studies on genotypes of coronavirus and interaction with host factors are needed to answer these questions.",

Male sex was identified as a poor prognostic factor in two studies by univariate analysis with P = 0.04\n5\n and 0.06.\n13\n In the present study, the mortality was 20% for male patients and 8.9% for female patients with P = 0.02. The high female : male ratio of 6:1 in our cohort of diarrhea patients contributed to the better prognosis. We also expected that the CXR scores might be very high during the peak diarrhea period if diarrhea was associated with progression of pneumonia but we failed to find an association as shown in Fig. 3. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was only \u22120.09 (P = 0.5). Only three out of the 49 patients had CXR scores >18. This implied that pneumonia was not severe when diarrhea worsened.
