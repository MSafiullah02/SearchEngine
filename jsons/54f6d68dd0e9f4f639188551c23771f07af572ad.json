On February 26, the second COVID-19 case was detected in Sweden (a person that had visited northern Italy) (9) . From February 27 and onwards, more cases were detected, but the growth rate in new cases was initially fairly low. 1 These dates corresponds well with the first peaks observed in Google trends in Sweden between January 1 and April 2, 2020 for the search string \"coronavirus\" (see the red line in Figure 1 ), thus indicating that a general awareness of the new virus in the Swedish population started by the end of January (which seems to be the case for most countries in the world). Sweden is exceptional compared to most other countries in the world, in its quite different response to the COVID-19 outbreak by relying on individuals acting responsibly and adhering to public recommendations. This outlier position has led to international attention and debate (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . While several other countries have adopted quite drastic policies to stop infectivity at a larger scale, Sweden has adopted a route of less restrictive social distancing policies and mild recommendations following the Coronavirus epidemic. 2 By March 26, The Public Health Agency of Sweden's (PHAS) 1 See supplementary table 1 in the Supplementary material for a timeline of the development of the Coronavirus in Sweden. 2 By March 26, the date used for the analysis in this paper, Sweden's closest neighbours and the major economies of Europe had imposed social distancing by adopting policies that implied a full, or close to full recommendations and policy suggestions 3 were still relatively mild: (i) public gatherings of more than 500 individuals not allowed, (ii) all citizens with a cold or influenza-like symptoms asked to remain at home, (iii) individuals older than 70 years instructed to limit contact with other persons as far as possible, (iv) employers with the possibility to let their employees work from home recommended to consider recommending that, (v) all education in high schools and at Universities changed to distance teaching, (vi) non-essential travels within Sweden recommended to be avoided, (vii) individuals without symptoms instructed to continue with their usual daily activities (even if family members are infected by .",

It can be noted that March 26 is well beyond both the dates when the more draconian policies had been adopted in other countries in Europe and when Google trends peak for Sweden on March 12 (on March 11, the WHO declares the spread of COVID-19 a pandemic and on March 13 the PHAS declares that the COVID-19 situation in Sweden has entered a new phase with a high risk of community spread). 4 Important work in Italy and China (23, 24) use mobile phone data to document mobility patterns using mobile phone data. mild policies, and is the first (to the best of our knowledge) to relate representative mobile phone users and their mobility patterns against a baseline in normal times and to adjust for seasonal patterns in mobility.",

Individuals' mobility patterns in mid-January, before the first confirmed Swedish case (cf. Supplementary table S1) and when the general awareness of COVID-19 was still limited in the Swedish public (cf. Figure 1) , is compared to the situation on March 26, with 2,840 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 77 fatalities (25) and when the Swedish government had instigated a number of relatively mild recommendations and restrictions (cf. Supplementary table S1). Any general difference in mobility patterns between mid-January and end of March, not related to the Corona epidemic, is accounted for by netting out the corresponding differences between January 17 and March 28 2019. Under the assumption that the time difference in 2019 represents the counterfactual change in mobility in 2020, the DiD estimand will here capture the causal impact of virus spread and government actions on behavioral responses (26, 27) . Throughout the analysis, we use Thursdays as the weekday of study (Thursday is the \"most typical\" day (28)).",

Each phone's locations can only be tracked for a maximum of 24 hours. For this analysis phone's locations were aggregated to hourly data by 1km\uf0b41km squares for the four dates. Sweden had a market penetration of mobile phones of 1.27 per person in 2018 (29), and 98 percent of Swedish households in 2017 had a mobile phone (30) . As most individuals carry one phone, the number of observed phones is approximated with individuals in the analysis. Figure 2 describes the mobile phone density 10-11AM on January 16, 2020 (the left map shows the larger Stockholm area, including Uppsala, and the right map zooms in on the central parts of Stockholm). 6 In total, the location of more than half a million mobile phones are observed. The highest density, with more than 10,000 individuals per square kilometer, is observed in central Stockholm with a high concentration of commercial and business activities. High density levels are also observed in an octopus-like pattern along the main commuting routes (subway, commuter train and highways) out from the center, where a high mass of business and industrial areas are located.",

The home location was deduced from the night rest location of the mobile phone, and was calculated for 54 percent of the phones in the data (see supplementary material for definition). Table 1 shows that on January 16, 2020, the maximum distance travelled from home was on average 6,172 meters, and by March 26, 2020, the DiD estimate shows that this distance had been reduced with 2,346 meters: a 38 percent reduction. This change is mainly caused by a substantial increase in the number of immobile individuals. An interesting feature of the decreased mobility is that the effect seems homogenous across areas with different socioeconomic characteristics. 12 Table 1 shows that the decrease in mobility is the same as the overall effect in areas with the 10 percent highest concentration of residents belonging to visible minorities. The same is true for areas with the 10 percent highest concentration of residents having a university degree, living in relative poverty 13 , or belonging to the risk age group (above 70). 10 The DiD estimates are related to their pre-COVID19 outbreak values (the January 16, 2020, values). 11 The large share of phone users moving less than one kilometer on January 16, 2020, can be related to the fact that 14.7 percent of the population are 75+, and that only 60.5 percent of the population above 15 are employed (33, 34) . 12 Using adjacent registry data on socioeconomic characteristics, the residents in each geographical area (1km square) can be characterized and linked to the night rest location of the mobile phone. 13 Poverty is defined as having a disposable income below 60 percent of the full population aged 16-74. based on Google information which may suffer from lack of comparability due to selection and seasonality issues) 14 , suggests that the social distancing is somewhat smaller in Stockholm than in similar cities with more stricter policies in neighboring countries.",

Thus, one can get an estimation about cell phones' mobility at the geographical resolution of the position of cell towers. The positional data granularity, i.e. the minimal spatial object, corresponds to the size of Service Area (SA) circa several hundred meters. Due to the large volume of data (roughly a half billion observations per day), the calculations were carried out in a parallel manner on a Spark Cluster operating on top of a distributed file system (HDFS). This allowed to reduce the preprocessing delivery time from about 20 hours to about 1-1.5 hours, and offering a straightforward way to further increase performance in the future by adding more nodes to the cluster.",

As the phone user moves in space and the phone-service is switched from one tower to another tower, a motion can be registered and stored. However, instead of assuming that each phone moves between the towers (the service does but not the phone), we assume that the phone moves to the half-way distance intersection point between the cell-towers. In the subsequent steps of mobility calculations, new intersection points are determined by finding the half-distance between the last intersection point and the new cell tower servicing the user. The calculation is exact enough for the construction of usable mobility data, but also coarse enough not to identify detailed trajectories of the phone-user 1 . The procedure allows us to mimic mobility trajectories that come closer to factual mobility, and that is more well distributed geographically compared to distributions using cell tower locations alone. Using this technique, the maximum distance moved away from the assumed coordinates of origin (residential coordinates) during the course of the day is calculated.",

First, compared to knearest computations, fixed-area measures risk having several measurement problems related to the so called boolean border and MAUP (1-3). In Supplementary Figure S4 , the first of the listed biases is illustrated in the two km\u00b2 areas (grid areas A and B, containing 10 x 10, 100m\u00b2 units eachequivalent to the geocoded level of detail in the population register). Let us assume that the different colours represent demographic qualities we want to associate with the cell-towers and km\u00b2. The illustrated cell tower (X) is providing service to the encircled population, however by aggregating the population data on km\u00b2 level (unit named A), a different set of demographic qualities are assigned to the area and the cell tower.",

In km\u00b2-areas B,C,D, the demographic ratios would be based on varying population counts, where the ratio in km\u00b2 area C would be based on only two 100 m units. The bespoke neighborhood approach makes uses a different technique for matching population data to the phone data. In the subsequent description the various steps will be presented: 1. Using the bespoke neighborhood tool EquiPop flow (https://equipop.kultgeog.uu.se/) we calculate the share of a selection of demographic qualities around each populated 100m2 unit. For each location the 100 nearest neighbors (full or adult population depending on variable) are searched and the demographic ratio is calculated for each populated coordinate. Using spatial join(in ARCGis pro), we match the rendered population computation values to the midpoint of the KM2 on the basis of proximity. The procedure ensures that the population variables represent the population composition at each KM2 midpoint. 2. Demographic qualities we are including in this part of the analyses include a. Belonging to an age-risk-group (full population). In Sweden all individuals >= 70 years of age, as well as all individuals having different health conditions are indicated as risk-groups that all other individuals should try to reduce contact with as much as possible. We have access to age as a variable (but not health conditions) so we calculate the share of individuals being aged 70 or older among the 100 and 500 nearest neighbors from each coordinate. b. Belonging to visible minorities (full population): Individuals born in Africa, Asia (minus Russia), and Latin America are listed as visible minorities. The underlying reasons for this classification are manifold and include: risk of discrimination on labour and housing market. In addition, recent years' migration increase is strongly associated with VM individuals, with poor language skills, residential segregation, etc., are more common in these immigrant groups compared to other groups. Under the current circumstances -poor integration, lower skills in Swedish, discrimination and segregation may lead to information deficits relating to recommended precautions and potential risks.",

By exploiting a DiD strategy, the causal impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on aggregate mobility is estimated for the larger Stockholm area using representative mobile phone data from one of the major Swedish mobile operators. The analysis reaches four mainconclusions. (i) The daytime population in residential areas increased significantly: a 64 percent average increase in the number of individuals in the areas with the largest increases in daytime population (Hot spots). (ii) The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly: there was a 33 percent average decrease in the areas with the largest decreases in daytime population (Cold spots). (iii) The distance individuals move from their homes during a day was substantially reduced: there was a 38 percent decrease in the maximum distance moved and a 36 percent increase in the share of individuals who move less than one kilometer from home. (iv) Similar reductions in mobility were found for residents in areas with different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (visible minorities, highly educated, poor, and being 70 years or older). The results show that even mild public recommendations and restrictions can compel people to practice social distancing, such as staying away from crowded areas and avoiding unnecessary travel. For example, more people stay in close proximity to their home, complying with the recommendation by the PHAS to work from home if possible. Hence, adopting a more lenient strategy based on individuals' judgement and sense of responsibility can be an effective strategy in a society with a large social capital and trust in public expert authority. In addition, there can be benefits to the more lenient strategy as it allows for flexibility (e.g. allowing individuals to take care of important matters, and enabling parents to continue to work by keeping elementary schools open).An interesting and puzzling finding is that the change in mobility does not differ across areas with different socio-economic characteristics (visible minorities, highly educated, poor, and being 70 years or older). This is at odds with the increasingly popular narrative in the media reporting a clear socioeconomic gradient in the social distancing response(35). It is also at odds with the fact that 6 of the 15 first fatalities in Stockholm belonged to the same minority group and resided in the same neighborhood (36), potentially suggesting that there are area-based heterogeneities in mobility response. A potential explanation is that this analysis measures the responses to the COVID-19 outbreak on March 26. Even if by that date the severity of the epidemic and the necessity to take precaution might have been conveyed to most societal groups, still, the speed of adopting the social distancing practices might have varied across various groups. There can also be other sources of heterogeneity (e.g. housing conditions). We consider this to be an important question for future analyses.The analysis shows a non-negligible mobility response in Sweden to the COVID-19 contagion and social distancing policies relying (mainly) on voluntary actions. This is an important lesson for policy as it may not be necessary to close down the whole economy to achieve social distancing. But it is of course still an open question whether these responses are large enough to slow down the spread of the disease. Moreover, the anecdotal evidence, which must be interpreted carefully (e.g. evidence",
