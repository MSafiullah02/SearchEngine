In the United States, Waldemar Johanson described that the pharyngeal flora of patients changed within a few days after hospital admission; from predominantly Gram-positive to predominantly Gram-negative bacteria [4]. Subsequent studies revealed that these Gram-negative bacteria were the main causes of hospital-acquired infections (at that time), especially of nosocomial pneumonias. Around the same time, a Dutch clinical microbiologist, Dick van der Waaij, described the interaction between gut flora and infections in neutropenic gnotobiotic mice [5]. He demonstrated that conservation of the anaerobic intestinal flora prevented such mice from bacterial overgrowth with Gram-negative bacteria and subsequent infections. He called this phenomenon \u201ccolonization resistance\u201d. In those days, these observations were based on conventional microbiological culture techniques. Yet, this concept\u2014a healthy gut flora that prevents infection\u2014has now been repeatedly confirmed in studies using deep sequencing technologies.",

The targeted pathogens for prevention were the Enterobacterales (e.g., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The intestinal flora was considered the source of these potential pathogenic micro-organisms for colonization of the upper respiratory tract during hospitalization. Therefore, topical antibiotics were chosen that were not absorbed (to avoid systemic distribution), that were active against the listed pathogens and that would not disturb the anaerobic flora. As such, the combination of an aminoglycoside (tobramycin) and colistin was selected, and these antibiotics were administered in an oropharyngeal paste applied in the buccal cavity and as a solution inserted through the nasogastric tube (both four times daily) (Fig. 1). Initial small studies, mainly in trauma patients, led to two modifications of the regimen. Amphotericin B was added to prevent overgrowth with yeasts. Furthermore, a prophylactic 4-day course of a cephalosporin\u2014cefotaxime\u2014(not active against anaerobes) was added to treat any incubating infection caused by the commensal flora of the respiratory tract at the time of hospital admission. The choice of cefotaxime was motivated by the assumption that trauma patients would have\u2014at the time of trauma and immediate hospital admission\u2014a normal respiratory tract flora susceptible to a third-generation cephalosporin. In later SDD studies, enrolled patient populations gradually changed to also include surgical and medical patients, with extensive medical histories, including prior antibiotic use and carriage with bacteria non-susceptible to cefotaxime.",

SOD consists of the oropharyngeal application of the same antibiotics without the intragastric application and without systemic prophylaxis. As at that time, many patients eligible for SDD were treated with antibiotics for clinical indications and that an increasing number of patients were colonized with bacteria resistant to second-generation cephalosporins when admitted to ICU, it was decided not to include the 4-day course of systemic antibiotics in SOD.",

Although valid to determine the effectiveness of an intervention in many circumstances, individual randomization may reduce the generalizability of study results and is suboptimal if cross-transmission occurs. The latter implies that colonized patients pose a risk for acquisition of bacterial carriage and subsequent infection to other patients and, vice versa, decolonized patients may offer indirect protection to those not receiving SDD. Both effects will reduce the effectiveness of SDD, compared to settings where all eligible patients will receive SDD. To overcome this, investigators have adopted cluster designs, in which all eligible patients in an ICU receive SDD or not, as it would happen in real life.",

For an intervention with an intended immediate start after ICU admission, this practically precludes enrollment of all eligible patients and will delay the start of SDD in many that do consent. This may lead to less generalizable study populations and reduce the effectiveness of SDD, as compared to settings where SDD would be started in all eligible patients upon ICU admission [13]. In the first clustered SDD study, performed in two ICUs in a single center, informed consent was still required [9]. In three more recent cluster-randomized studies, waivers for informed consent were granted in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia, and the UK. Waivers were granted, because SDD was considered part of daily ICU practice in each country. At the same time, there was true equipoise on the effects of SDD, leading to marked differences in practice between ICUs. Moreover, SDD (and SOD) were considered safe and it was acknowledged that a cluster-randomized study would not be feasible without such a waiver. The waivers allowed an immediate start of SDD after ICU admission and enrollment of 6000 patients and more [7, 8, 10].",

As study sites were selected upon a moderate-to-high prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, such prophylaxis was considered inappropriate, as was an alternative prophylactic regimen providing a better coverage of these bacteria, such as a carbapenem. Indeed, most patients admitted to ICU will receive systemic antibiotic treatment for medical reasons, with therapy based on local epidemiology and practices. Therefore, the consequences of patients not being treated systemically during these 4 days remain unknown, as the relative contribution of systemic antibiotics to the overall effect of SDD has never been determined in a single study. In a Cochrane review, including 36 studies involving 6914 patients treated in ICUs published until March 2009, the combination of topical plus systemic antibiotics was associated with less infections and deaths, whereas regimens of only topical treatment were associated with less infections but not with less deaths [18].

The introduction of SOD/SDD in eight ICUs was followed by statistically significant reductions in resistance rates for all antimicrobial agents [20]. In a single-center evaluation, 21 years of SDD use was also not associated with an increase of antibiotic resistance in ICU [21].

In a subsequent study, the same investigators analyzed the gut microbiome in ten ICU patients that received SDD [24]. For comparison, gut microbiota were also determined twice in ten healthy subjects with a 1-year interval. The microbiota of the ICU patients differed from those of healthy subjects and was characterized by lower microbial diversity, decreased levels of Escherichia coli and of anaerobic Gram-positive, butyrate-producing bacteria of the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, and an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and enterococci. Four types of resistance genes, providing resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, disinfectants, and tetracyclines, were significantly more abundant among ICU patients than in healthy subjects. These findings confirm the principles of SDD, eradicate Enterobacterales but not anaerobes from the gut, but more studies are needed to better determine the effects of SDD on selection and transmission of resistance genes.",
