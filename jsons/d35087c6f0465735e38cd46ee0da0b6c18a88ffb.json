We also numerically confirmed the transition probability between those states. Based on the asymmetry in both the dynamics behavior and backbone C\u03b1 importance, we further suggested a relation between chains in the trimer spike protein, which may help in the vaccine design and antibody neutralization.",

In this study, we used publicly available simulation trajectories of S protein and studied the asymmetric dynamics nature of the trimer structure. Markov state model was applied to divide the conformational space into 8 macrostates. The representative structures along the most probable channel in transition path theory are shown to present a clear route from the close state to the partially open state. Transition matrix was calculated to determine the probability of close-open transitions, with maximum of 9.9% from the close macrostate implied a relationship between chain A and two other chains. Yet, whether this relation originates from the mutual influence among chains or the intrinsic asymmetry in biological functions needs further investigation. Overall, our study quantitatively analyzed the motion of S1 subunit in S protein with important C\u03b1 distances and residues. Possible prevention and cure searching progress could be facilitated combining with these vital findings, which provide new opportunities for potential drug research and vaccine development.

            "text": "This implication is supported by the random forest model results. Random forest model reached high accuracy in predicting macrostates based on the pair-wised C\u03b1 distances on S1subunit. The reason for the good performance in macrostates prediction is that the input feature contains the motion of chain A, which is sufficient to identify the main conformational change from the close to the open state. There is only a small drop of 4.14% in the prediction accuracy with reduced features, which does not include the motion of chain A. Combined with the finding of asymmetric dynamics in RMSF result, we hypothesized that there is a correlation between the chain A and two other chains, causing the asymmetrical dynamics behavior. Moreover, Moreover, in order to focus on the tertiary structure, the importance of C\u03b1 distances was accumulated to S1 domain structure and we numerically identified key structure correlated with RBD in chain B, NTD in chain C, RBD in chain B and NTD in chain B in descending order. This relationship may come from the chain B and C's contribution to the protein motion in chain A. This could also originate from the proteinprotein interaction along the opening movement of chain A. Further investigation of this mutual influence is warranted for a detailed clarification.Markov state model showed a great difference in transition probability in macrostate 2 (78.0%) and 1 (54.0%), which are in closed state and partailly open state, respectively. This result implies that S1 subunit is more likely to stay in closed state, which agrees with the experimental finding that the close state is more dynamically stable than the partially open state . However, macrostate 8 exihibited a high probability (97.9%) to stay within itself, where the RBD is detached from the S2 fusion machinery. This showed a possibledynamically stable state followed by the partially open state of the RBD and could be important in the close-open transition. Transition path theory further provided potential channels from macrostate 2 to 8 with the top one of 23.7% probability. This channel is considered important in representing the transient shifting and can be treated as the typical protein movement. A rational design affecting the close-to-open transition can be developed through this key channel along with the important residue pairs and key tertiary structure domains.",
