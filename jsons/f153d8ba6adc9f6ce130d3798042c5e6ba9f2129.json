However, its relevance depends on the nature of the samples (tracheal aspiration, BAL, pleural liquid, lung biopsy) and the moment they are harvested (immediately following the onset of symptoms and before any antibiotic). Since its isolation is difficult, an atypical bacteria requires specific isolation media. Legionella require BCYE agar, which is sometimes made selective by the addition of antibiotics and/or antifungals. If these antibiotics are ineffective on common bacteria, the samples are treated by acidification (pH 2) and thermal shock before being cultured. The specificity of a culture performed in this manner is 100% and its sensitivity ranges from 50 to 80%. However, the results are not available before two to three days, and they can be delayed until two to three weeks for some other organisms such as M. pneumoniae. Identification and differentiation of colonies depends on their cultural, biochemical, and enzymatic characteristics as well as their antigenic characteristics in direct immunofluorescence or by agglutination with specific immunserums. The association of these different elements is sometimes not sufficiently discriminating to provide identification of the species. Molecular biology is an innovative tool [4] . Identification of the etiologic agent is particularly important in the perspective of an epidemiologic investigation.",

A variation of two dilutions between early serum and late serum with a count of \u00b3 1/128 for the late serum is sufficient for a diagnosis in the case of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antibodies. Likewise, the association for M. pneumoniae of an antibody titer of \u00b3 1/64 and cold agglutinins of \u00b3 1/64 provides a diagnosis.

Beginning in 1938, a series of cases described atypical pneumonia as characterized by pneumonia with a prolonged duration, no reaction to treatment with penicillin, and non-specific radiological images [10] . The chest X-ray shows either a non-systematized alveolar syndrome or systematized opacities. The inferior lobes are affected more often than the superior. The patient's immunological condition plays a role in the acquisition of a M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Thus, an examination of the BAL fluid of a group of immunosuppressed patients with pleural effusions in the ICU led to the isolation of this bacterium in 5% of the cases [11] . A serologic examination of two sera sampled at a 10-to-14-day interval is the most common diagnostic method used. However, the diagnosis can be hampered by cross reactions between M. pneumoniae and other commensal mycoplasms among the oropharyngeal florae. There are different opinions on this issue in the literature: a cause of error for some authors [12] , a negligible parameter for others [13] . At present, the IgA ELISA tests have a sensitivity of 86 to 100% and a specificity of 100% for the serologic diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection [14] .",

There is a delay in the maturation of the reticulate body and an inhibition of infectious elementary body differentiation which is expressed by a persistence of aberrant forms in the host cell. The bacterium is viable but not cultivatable. A parallel can be made with viral latency. C. pneumonia is transmitted through the air. It is responsible for both upper and lower respiratory infections but no symptom is specific. The radiological findings are minor but show extensive bilateral pneumonia with, sometimes, pleural effusion. In adults with chronic bronchitis, immunosuppressed patients, or the elderly, C. pneumoniae can cause severe infections. However, the pathogenic role of this bacteria is now challenged [16] . Rapid and precise diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are not currently available: culture isolation of these bacteria requires the collection of cells by scraping the mucous membranes, then rapid transport at a stable temperature (+4 8C). Amplification techniques have been improved [17] . The most studied and widely used is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [18] . Values superior to 98% have been described in terms of specificity. On the other hand, these tests do not improve sensitivity vis--vis culture. Serodiagnosis of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae is difficult to interpret because seroprevalence is high in the population. Approximately 75% of subjects have anti-C. pneumoniae antibodies and there are cross reactions with C. trachomatis and C. psittasi in 50% of the cases [19] . Thus, when the etiologic and epidemiologic data and the seroconversion threshold are available, they help in the careful interpretation of the microbiologic results [20] .",

C. burnetii proliferates in low pH phagolysosomes. It appears in two forms, one of which is a resistant form resembling a spore with considerable virulence. In aerosol form, this bacteria can be pathogenic at a concentration of one colony forming unit (cfu). Contamination is essentially respiratory and its incidence is probably underestimated. A retrospective study that included 22 s496 sera was performed between 1982 and 1990 at the Centre National Franais de Rfrence des Rickettsies (French Rickettsia Reference Center). Serologic observation by indirect immunofluorescence was also performed in 1988 on 924 blood-donor sera. The seroprevalence was 4%. The incidence recorded during this 9-year period was 0.58 per 100 000 inhabitants [21] . C. burnetii causes Q fever, a polymorphic disease (Q from the word`query') [22, 23] . Infections in man are essentially contracted through the air and by inhaling aerosols in contact with mammals. Current major epidemics are principally linked with livestock [24, 25] . Dissemination by the wind of infected dust is possible making it difficult to confirm animal contact. Q fever is a disease that is more frequently diagnosed, and more severe, in men than in women [26] . Indeed, the sex ratio of 323 patients admitted to hospitals in France with a diagnosis of Q fever between 1982 and 1990 was 2.5/1 [21] . However, systematic research for antibodies directed against C. burnetii in the sera of 942 blood donors in the same country revealed a sex ratio of 1/1. Sex hormones, especially estradiol, are said to play a protective role in the development of the disease [27] .",

The mean duration of incubation is 20 days but can reach two months, thereby confusing the epidemiologic data [24] . Schematically, there are three forms of acute Q fever which are shown in Figure 2 : self-limited flu-like syndrome, hepatitis, and pneumonia. Pulmonary symptoms were the origin of the description of the disease [28] . Most cases are asymptomatic or benign, characterized by a nonproductive cough, fever, and minimal auscultatory abnormalities. In certain cases, pulmonary symptoms can be severe with major hypoxemia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [29] . Hemoptysis can be observed. Chest X-ray reveals nonspecific images of interstitial pneumonia, or, sometimes, an acute lobular pneumonia. The images initially appear in the hilus and are most often located in the inferior lobes [30] . The duration of symptoms ranges from 10 to 90 days and the mortality rate is from 0.5 to 1.5% [21] . Standard biological examinations are nonspecific: the absence of hyperleukocytosis and thrombopenia is of interest. The specific diagnosis is principally based on serology by indirect immunofluorescence.",

Betalactams cannot concentrate in such cells, aminoglycosides are inactive in acid pH and macrolids are effective in basic pH. Moreover, none of the antibiotics that are active against C. burnetii (rifampicin, cotrimoxazole, tetracyclines, clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones) is bactericidal [33] . The prognosis of acute Q fever is usually spontaneously favorable with these bacteriostatic antibiotics [34] . On the other hand, for chronic forms such as endocarditis, bacteriostatic antibiotics control the disease but cannot cure it [35] . Maurin et al. [36] hypothesized that the absence of bactericidal activity of antibiotics against C. burnetii was due to their inactivation by the acid pH in phagolysosomes. By adding a lysosomotropic alkalinizing molecule, hydroxychloroquine, to fluoroquinolones and doxycycline, the authors succeeded in restoring the bactericidal activity of these molecules [36, 37] .",

Finally, the relationships of Legionella with other microorganisms in aquatic media are an essential element of their survival and cast light on the particular epidemiology of legionellosis. The host-parasite relationships with protozoa observed by Rowbotham [40] beginning in 1980 now appear to be fundamental in the pathogenesis and epidemiology of Legionella [41] . Legionella are capable of entering and proliferating in numerous amoebic species. They are found in the phagolysosomal vacuoles according to a process that is in every respect comparable with that observed in infected human macrophages [42] . They survive in amoeba in vitro between 0 and 45 8C. The actively proliferate at 35 8C in vacuoles and trigger lysis in amoeba cells. The result is bacterial culturing of the environmental medium. Legionella survive also in amoebic cysts. Cysts are extremely resistant entities which protect amoebas when environmental conditions are unfavorable.

In addition, there are symptoms such as watery diarrhea (20 to 40% of the cases) and neurological signs with confusion. The neurological forms [48] are the signs of encephalic involvement, probably due to a toxin. Cardiac injury is usually located in the pericardium. Endocarditis on valve prostheses has been confirmed by culture [49] . Direct involvement of the digestive tube is in the form of peritonitis or necrotizing colitis. Classic liver lesions are due to the toxin. Renal involvement, observed in 50% of legionellosis cases, is shown by proteinuria and transitory hematuria. In 13% of the patients, acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis can appear. Similarly, signs on chest X ray are observed in 90% of the cases, and do not distinguish Legionella pneumonia except for their rapid aggravation, especially under inappropriate antibiotics. Nonspecific biological anomalies are observed during systemic involvement. Biological alteration that is more characteristic of legionellosis is hypophosphatemia.

Observation by direct immunofluorescence with conjugates provides a rapid diagnosis \u00b1 Legionella appears as small bacilli.

Detection of the urinary antigens of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is considered as a specific, rapid and confirmed diagnosis. Urinary antigens are detected from the first days of the infection and up to 60 days later, as after appropriate antibiotics [9] . However, serology remains the most frequent means to diagnose legionellosis even though it is often late or even retrospective.",
