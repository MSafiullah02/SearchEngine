            "text": "Antimalarial drugs are chemotherapy agents that are used in the treatment of malaria. These include drugs such as chloroquine, mefloquine, and halofantrine. This review focuses on chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinacrine, also known as Mepacrine\u00ae or Atabrine\u00ae. Quinacrine is a synthetic drug that was developed in 1930 and became the main antimalarial agent used by the Allies during the World War II. Chloroquine was developed in 1934 to replace quinine. Hydroxychloroquine is derived from chloroquine beta hydroxylation. It was first synthesized during the 1950s. Despite a few positive reports on successful use of older antimalarial drugs in the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), the usefulness of antimalarials was not more widely acknowledged until 1951 when a treatment series using quinacrine was published (17/18 of treated DLE patients improved). Since then these substances have also been successfully used to treat other non\u2010infectious, inflammatory diseases. Their use is restricted, however, to malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Yet in recent decades, in dermatology in particular, antimalarial agents have been used successfully to treat a number of other diseases, and new uses continue to be found even today.",

            "text": "An important effect results from the \u201clysosomotropic\u201d properties of CQ/HCQ which will be discussed in greater detail. CQ/HCQ are amphiphilic molecules (lipophilic ring structure, hydrophilic side chain, Figure 1, 2). They thus tend to deposit in interphases, for instance, in phospholipid membranes. As weakly basic molecules, they can pass through the membranes and are protonated in the acidic milieu of the cytoplasm. As a positively loaded molecule, CQ/HCQ lose their ability to pass through the membrane and thus accumulate there (factor 100\u20131 000), primarily in macrophages and lysosomes. In the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria, intralysosomal proteases are thus inhibited, leading to heme accumulation which is toxic for the parasites. In human leukocyte lysosomes, the accumulation of antigens (low\u2010affinity peptides) on the \u201cmajor histocompatibility complex\u201d as well as stimulation of Toll\u2010like receptor 9 is inhibited. The processing of autoantigens in particular is diminished and is thus also decreased in subsequent immunological effects (Table 1). These indirect effects on T cells enable these agents to be well combined with other immunomodulatory drugs. The delayed clinical effects may be explained by the fact that they primarily affect antigen\u2010presenting cells.",

The maximum daily dosage is 3.5(\u20134) mg/kg of ideal body weight for chloroquine or 6(\u20136.5) mg/kg ideal body weight for hydroxychloroquine. If the maximum dosages are observed, retinopathy is not a concern, even with for therapy lasting several years [5, 6].

There are still no hard\u2010and\u2010fast criteria for diagnosing chloroquine\u2010associated retinopathy. Diagnosis is based on the subjective assessment of the examining physician. Although retinal damage is highly unlikely when ideal body weight is used to determine the maximum daily dose (see above), an ophthalmological examination (fundoscopy, vision field testing, color vision testing, Amsler grid test) is advised before beginning treatment or within the first few months of therapy as are annual controls \u2013 or semi\u2010annual controls for patients over 65 or with renal or liver insufficiency [8]. The baseline examination is important for detecting central red scotomas which occur in up to 6 % of the healthy population. Scotoma can also occur in patients with systemic lupus, as a result of vasculitis, or in patients with anti\u2010phospholipid syndrome or corticosteroid\u2010induced diabetes. Careful surveillance is essential if the suggested dosages are exceeded as well as in older patients and patients on long\u2010term continuous therapy (> 5 years). Self\u2010testing with an Amsler grid test (once a month; Figure 2) is recommended for early detection [10].",

Thus it should be decided on an individual basis what the risks associated with the underlying disease or alternative therapies are compared with the potential side effects of antimalarial therapy. Several observational studies and literature analyses have reported that HCQ may be safely taken during pregnancy [13]. In one prospective, randomized controlled study, the children of 20 mothers with lupus who were treated with HCQ had higher Apgar scores and no anomalies. In addition, there were no reported lupus flares compared with 3/10 in the control group. Based on published reports, especially on the use of HCQ in pregnant women, the drug appears to be safe and is thus also recommended for use in pregnant women with lupus.

These in turn are a result of reverse diffusion of CQ/HCQ from the \u201cdeep compartments.\u201d Antimalarial drugs are not stored in adipose tissue. Thus, the key to avoiding retinopathy is to observe the maximum recommended daily dosages of 3.5(\u20134) mg/kg chloroquine (ideal body weight) and 6(\u20136.5) mg/kg hydroxychloroquine. This is especially important for lighter patients (especially women) and small but obese patients. If there is delayed elimination due to renal or liver dysfunction, the dosage should be further reduced. Ophthalmological controls during the first few months of therapy are advised, and later in larger intervals. If the above\u2010mentioned guidelines are followed, CQ/HCQ may even be given over longer periods of time with minimal risk.",
