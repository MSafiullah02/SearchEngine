Intuitively, it is done either by shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected individuals or by increasing the opportunities for contact between susceptible individuals. Here, we provide a comparative study on these two control strategies by establishing an epidemic model with nonuniform stochastic interactions. It seems that the two strategies should be similar, since shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected individuals somehow increases the chances for contact between susceptible individuals. However, analytical results indicate that the effectiveness of the former strategy sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the combinations of different interaction rates, whereas the latter one is quite robust and efficient. Simulations are shown to verify our analytical predictions. Our work may shed light on the strategic choice of disease control.",

Mathematical models not only deepen the understanding of epidemic dynamics, but also shed light on the control of diseases. In recent years, much attention has been paid to epidemic control via social relationship adjustment [8] [9] [10] . As a pioneering work, Gross et al. proposed a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on an adaptive network. Therein the susceptible individual breaks the link with the infected partner and rewire to another randomly selected susceptible individual [11] . This rewiring rule brings in highly complex dynamics (such as bistability and oscillation) to the classical SIS model. The rewiring dynamics then opens up the avenue on how individualized partnership adjustment alters the epidemic dynamics. On the one hand, besides the SIS model, typical epidemic models have almost been investigated including the susceptible-infectedrecovered-susceptible (SIRS) model [12] , the susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model [13] , and the susceptibleinfected-vaccinated (SIV) model [14] . On the other hand, more realistic and complex link-rewiring rules are proposed. In particular, generalizations of Gross et al.'s rewiring rule are mainly twofold. For one thing, after the disconnection of susceptible-infected (SI) link, the susceptible is assumed to reconnect to a randomly selected member of the population whether it is susceptible or not [15] . For another, the infected is also allowed to switch its partnership from the susceptible to a new randomly selected contact [16] . Besides the rewiring rule which is dependent on the infection process, the rewiring rule that is independent of the infection process was also investigated [17, 18] . In spite of different model assumptions, all these models showed that the infection propagation can be * bin.wu@bupt.edu.cn \u2020 Corresponding author: zhouda@xmu.edu.cn greatly influenced by the dynamical networks. In particular, the infection can be effectively suppressed by reducing the interaction opportunities between susceptible and infected individuals.",

            "text": "Besides the above-mentioned link-rewiring models, another type of adaptive network is the link-activation-deactivation model [19] [20] [21] . It assumes that a link can either be broken or recreated on the basis of the infectious states of the two end points of the link. In this model, only local information is required, which could be more realistic [10] . In particular, Guo et al. proposed an ASIS model, in which any SI link can be broken (deactivated). After the disconnection of an SI link, the two disconnected nodes can be reconnected again once both of them become susceptible (activated) [21] . Despite seeming differences, the link-activation-deactivation dynamics is similar to the rewiring dynamics. On the one hand, Guo et al. showed that the ASIS model (initiated on complete graphs) approximates the link-rewiring model [11] . On the other hand, the quasistationary (metastable) fraction of infected individuals can be reduced by increasing the effective breaking rate (proportional to the ratio of deactivating rate to activating rate). This echoes the results based on the link-rewiring models that the disease can be controlled by reducing the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. Therefore, both types of linking dynamics in epidemic control can be seen as decreasing the interaction rate between susceptible and infected individuals (called SI control). Furthermore, considering that the effective breaking rate in [21] also depends on the activating rate between susceptibles, their work reminds us of the significance of susceptible-susceptible (SS) links in epidemic control.",

Unlike the models only allowing the breaking of SI links, we allow all three types of links [SS, SI, and infectedinfected (II)] to be broken, equipped with three independent parameters to characterize the breaking rates of SS, SI, and II links. Actually, this assumption mimics the intrinsic nature of human mobility [22, 23] , namely, people moving or changing their social relationships due to a variety of reasons, even without the consideration of avoiding infectious diseases. In this way, SI links should not be the only type that is allowed to be broken; both SS and II links can change. For example, in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) not only are the susceptible individuals willing to avoid contact from the infected individuals, but the susceptible-susceptible and infected-infected relationships may also be broken up due to unsatisfactory sexual experiences; i.e., the rewiring processes can happen in SS and II links. Besides, we allow all the individuals to be capable of adjusting any of their partners. This mirrors the freedom of social life. It also excludes the central control of epidemics, for example, via organizations.

However, the effectiveness of the SI control sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the intrinsic mobility rate of the population. In other words, there are cases such that the SI control cannot eliminate the disease as efficiently as the SS control. Simulation results are also shown for validating our theoretical predictions.

It should be pointed out that, when w SS = w SI = w II = 0, the transition probability matrix Eq. (2) violates the irreducible condition [33] that our analysis relies on. In fact, this case resembles the static network, which has been excluded from our analysis.

(6) extends the classical SIS model from uniform interaction rates to nonuniform interaction rates.

For one thing, it is natural to increase w SI for reducing the interaction rate (1/w SI ) between susceptible and infected individuals (SI control). For another thing, decreasing w SS can also reduce the exposure of susceptibles to infection (SS control). Therefore, we investigate the control of epidemics via these two strategies. More specifically, by taking the uniform interaction rates (w SS = w SI = w II > 0) as the reference case, we would like to provide a comparative study on both the SI control (w SI > w SS = w II ) and the SS control (w SS < w SI = w II ).

For large \u03bb e (i.e., \u03bb e > 2), there is a small region of bistability where the disease persists or dies out due to the initial infected fraction. Compared to the single continuous phase transition in the conventional (uniform) SIS model, the nonuniform SIS model can give rise to multiple phase transitions. The emergent bistability in adaptive SIS model has already been reported in previous studies [11, 15, 37, 38] , but it is quite difficult to approximate the conditions under which bistability is present.

In particular, the critical initial fraction of infected individuals, ensuring a dramatic outbreak of epidemics, is consistent with the unstable fixed point predicted by the analytical result (see the blue dashed lines in Fig. 7) . Disagreements, however, are also present. For example, the theoretical results tend to underestimate the final infection when the infection fraction is rare initially. In fact, this bistable case bears two internal equilibria lying at x * 1 (unstable) and x * 2 (stable) (x * 1 < x * 2 ). For a small initial fraction of infected individuals, the deterministic part of the system drives the infection to extinction based on the analytical investigation. Yet by its intrinsic stochastic nature of the epidemic spreading, the infection would increase in number and be possibly trapped around the stable equilibria from time to time. Even though it is a type of rare event, it takes quite long to escape from this trap. Thus on average it results in a relatively higher level of final fraction of infected individuals given the running time of simulations (here 10 6 generations). In other words, it is the interplay between the stochastic effect and stable equilibrium at zero that results in such inconsistency. It is noteworthy, despite this quantitative inconsistency, that the salient feature of the bistable dynamics is still captured by the analytical predictions.",

For strong infectious disease, however, it is more efficient to adopt the SS control than the SI control. This result is counterintuitive. Intuitively, reducing the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals is believed to suppress the disease propagation. Moreover, it seems that decreasing the interaction rate of SI links could naturally result in the increase of SS links [37] . How can these two strategies perform so differently? One of the salient features of our model is the variability of II links, which has seldom been addressed previously. Actually, increasing w SI is equivalent to decreasing both w SS and w II . In other words, the SI control is equivalent to simultaneously strengthening SS links and II links. Similarly, the SS control is equivalent to simultaneously reducing the closeness of Another feature of our reconnection rule is nonselectivity. In other words, individuals are allowed to rewire to a randomly selected member no matter if it is susceptible or not. Compared to the selective rule in [11] , individuals in our model do not necessarily know who gets infected currently, which is more realistic. Actually, the nonselective rule increases the exposure of the susceptible individuals to the infected individuals. This is very likely in the beginning of an epidemic season, where the information on infection status is unaccessible. In particular, even though the SI control increases the breaking possibility of each SI link, a new SI link may be generated again due to the nonselective rule. By contrast, the SS control makes a straightforward intervention during the process of disconnection. That is, by strengthening the closeness between susceptible individuals, the SS strategy reduces the possibility of SI connection effectively. In this way, the nonselective rule has a relatively small impact on the SS control. Therefore, in the framework of the nonselective rewiring rule, the SS strategy is more efficient than the SI strategy.",

For example, (1) our linking dynamics does not take into account the social interactions with memory, such as friendship and working partners, in which individuals preserve the contacts that they used to make [20, 21] , and (2) the link-rewiring process is a strong simplification of real adaptive networked human behavior. It is not necessarily realistic for individuals who break up a relationship to have a new partner immediately. However, it probably mimics the dynamics of networks in AIDS to some extent: The susceptible individuals break up their (mostly sexual) relationships with their infected partners and switch to other perceived healthy individuals. Moreover, the infected individuals may also rewire their links to other infected individuals.",

We propose another analytical method to overcome this restriction. The method is based on pair approximation and rate equations [36] .

The fraction of the infected individuals around a susceptible individual is SI S based on pair approximation. Thus there are on average k SI S infected neighbors around the selected susceptible individual, where k is the average degree of the entire network. Therefore, the infection probability of the susceptible individual within a small time interval t is \u03bb k SI For the evolution of the links, it can be caused both by the linking dynamics and the epidemic spreading. Taking the change of II as an example, when the linking dynamics happens (with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b1), II links would increase by one if an SI link is selected, then broken, and the infected individual of the SI link is selected, and it switches to another infected individual (with probability I SI w SI 2 ); II links would decrease by one if an II link is selected, then broken, and the selected infected individual switches to a susceptible individual (with probability S II w II ). When the epidemic spreading happens (with probability \u03b1), for the recovery event, an infected individual is selected (with probability I ), and it recovers with probability \u03bc t. If the selected I individual has q (0 q k) infected neighbors [with probability k q ( II I ) q (1 \u2212 II I ) k\u2212q ], the change of II links is \u2212q.
