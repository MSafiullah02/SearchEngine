They are able to infect a wide variety of mammals as well as avian species. In general, they cause respiratory and/or enteric infections, although some viruses may spread systemically. CoVs were brought to the centre of attention by the appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010CoV (SARS\u2010CoV) 8. These viruses contain a very large RNA genome (around 30 kb), the first two\u2010thirds of which code for the proteins involved in replication and transcription of the viral RNA. The other third of the genome codes among others for the structural proteins that build up the coronavirion. All CoVs contain a common set of structural proteins, consisting of the nucleocapsid (N), the spike (S), the membrane (M) and the envelope (E) protein 9, 10.",

            "text": "During their life cycle, CoVs interact with the host cell secretory pathway in several ways. In infected cells, CoVs induce the formation of a network of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes to which the viral replication\u2013transcription complexes are anchored 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The host cell pathways involved in the assembly of the DMV\u2010anchored replication\u2013transcription complexes are not known. However, CoV replication and the secretory pathway were shown to be closely connected as CoV RNA replication was severely affected when ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi transport was interfered by the addition of drugs, by the expression of dominant\u2010negative mutants or by the depletion of host proteins using RNA interference 6, 16, 17. Also during assembly of progeny virus, the CoV life cycle and the secretory pathway are intertwined. CoV morphogenesis predominantly takes place at the ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment. The ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment membranes are modified by viral glycoproteins thereby facilitating the budding of the nucleocapsid through these membranes, resulting in the assembly of progeny virus. The CoV M protein is the most important viral protein for the budding process. It is considered the building brick of the coronavirion as it interacts with all other virion components 18. The M protein localizes to the budding compartment, but it is also abundantly present in the Golgi apparatus beyond the site of budding 19, 20, 21, 22. After assembly, the coronavirions are subject to an intracellular post\u2010budding maturation step that occurs while trafficking through the Golgi apparatus 23. It thus appears that the host cell secretory pathway, including the Golgi apparatus, plays an essential role in the CoV life cycle, although the exact molecular mechanisms are not yet clear.",

            "text": "In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach with the aim to identify host cell proteins that are involved in CoV replication. We reasoned that changes in protein levels in a cell or a cellular compartment, upon virus infection, are more likely to occur if a protein is somehow involved in the replication of the virus. Here, we focused our efforts on the secretory pathway, which plays an important role in the CoV life cycle as detailed above. To diminish the complexity of the samples and because of the known importance of the Golgi apparatus in CoV infection, we investigated changes in protein composition of an isolated Golgi\u2010enriched fraction from cells infected with the prototype mouse hepatitis CoV (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)). To this end, SILAC was used for in vivo incorporation of stable isotopes into proteins for MS\u2010based quantitative proteomics 24. With this approach, we were able to identify 116 proteins that were significantly changed in their abundance in the Golgi\u2010enriched fraction upon MHV infection. Depletion of some of these proteins using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) was shown to affect MHV RNA synthesis or the production and release of infectious progeny virus, demonstrating that quantitative proteomics based on SILAC is a suitable method for the identification of host factors important for virus replication and may contribute to our understanding of host\u2013pathogen interactions.",

Cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (goat\u2010anti\u2010mouse conjugated with Alexa dye 568 from Invitrogen) for another 60 min at room temperature. After this incubation step, cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted on glass slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem) and analyzed on a confocal microscope (Leica TCS Sp2 CLSM). MHV replication in the cells was analyzed by quantifying the fluorescent intensities corresponding to the dsRNA of the transfected and infected cells using the software from Applied Precision on a DeltaVision RT microscope as described by Hagemeijer et al. 37.",

In order to reliably identify proteins that are differentially expressed in heavy\u2010 as compared to light\u2010labeled cells, the complete substitution of the light by the heavy forms of the amino acids is required. Therefore, the extent and efficiency of the stable isotope labeling of the HeLa\u2010CEACAM1a cells that were used in the experiments were analyzed. Cells were grown in either the heavy or the light culture medium for several passages after which the incorporation of the heavy forms of arginine (13C6\n15N4 Arg) and lysine (13C6\n15N2 Lys) was analyzed by MALDI\u2010TOF MS. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Upper panels show mass spectra of two randomly chosen peptides from cells that were not yet passaged in the heavy medium (passage 0). Peaks in these mass spectra correspond to unlabeled peptides with a mass of 1790 and 1953 Da, respectively. The middle and lower panels show the same peptides from cells that had been passaged one or six times in the heavy medium, respectively. The peaks show a mass difference of either 10 Da (Fig. 1A, 1790 versus 1800) or 8 Da (Fig. 1B, 1953 versus 1961), corresponding to the incorporation of a heavy 13C6\n15N4 Arg (Fig. 1A) or 13C6\n15N2 Lys (Fig. 1B), respectively. Already after one passage, the entire peptide signal corresponds to the heavy peak, indicating that the incorporation of the 13C15N amino acids was complete. For practical reasons, cells that had been passaged six times in the heavy medium were used in the experiments.",

Cells were inoculated with MHV A59 at a high MOI (approximately 50) to ensure that essentially all cells were infected. At 6 ho p.i. the MHV\u2010infected and mock\u2010infected cells were harvested and combined in a 1:1 ratio prior to isolation of a Golgi\u2010enriched fraction using an established method 30, 38. At 6 h p.i. MHV RNA replication and protein expression is high 35, 39 and the M protein, key player in MHV assembly, is easily detected in the Golgi apparatus. At later time points, the Golgi apparatus starts to vesiculate, which might interfere with our analysis 39. Enrichment of the Golgi in the isolated fraction was assessed by Western blot analysis using antibodies recognizing either the Golgi marker p23 or the viral M protein. In Fig. 2B, the enrichment of both proteins in the isolated fraction when compared to the PNS is shown, indicating that a Golgi\u2010enriched fraction was indeed isolated from the MHV infected HeLa\u2010CEACAM1a cells that could now be used for further MS analyses.",

As a control for the transfection efficiency, mRNA degradation was assessed by quantitative real\u2010time PCR. As shown in Fig. 5A, transfection of the different siRNA oligos led to a significant reduction (>85\u201395%) in the amount of mRNA encoding each of the 13 proteins when compared to cells transfected with the control siRNA targeting GFP. Seventy\u2010two hours post\u2010transfection, the cells were infected with MHV expressing a luciferase gene. MHV replication, production and release of infectious progeny virus were assessed by measuring luciferase expression as schematically shown in Fig. 5B and described in Section 2. MHV replication was assessed by measuring the intracellular luciferase values in the interfered and infected cells, at 12 h p.i. The level of luciferase protein expression has been previously shown to correspond to the level of MHV replication in the cells 16, 26. The production and release of progeny virus was studied by inoculating fresh (non\u2010interfered) HeLa\u2010CEACAM1a cells with the cell culture supernatants of the interfered and infected cells. The level of luciferase in these cells is a measure for the number of secreted infectious MHV virions. Figure 5C shows the relative luciferase expression levels, represented as the luciferase activity expressed relative to cells treated with siRNAs targeting GFP after correction for the cell viability. The data show that depletion of the protein C11orf59 and GLG1 resulted in a significantly increased luciferase expression, whereas cell viability was not affected, suggesting a role for C11orf59 and GLG1 in MHV replication. Figure 5D shows the production and release of infectious progeny virus showing the average intracellular luciferase expression values normalized to luciferase values of cells treated with siRNAs targeting GFP. The results show that depletion of vesicle\u2010trafficking protein SEC22B led to significantly increased levels of progeny virus release. As depletion of SEC22B did not affect MHV replication, we conclude that depletion of this protein enhances the assembly and/or release of infectious progeny virus. To investigate to what extent depletion of the selected proteins affected the secretory pathway per se, thereby possibly affecting MHV replication and release of infectious progeny virus, secretion of Gaussia luciferase was assessed after siRNA treatment of the cells. Figure 6 shows that secretion of Gaussia luciferase was not significantly affected after depletion of the selected proteins. Interestingly, although SEC22B depletion resulted in a slight decrease in Gaussia luciferase secretion (Fig. 6), it led to a significantly higher release of progeny virus (Fig. 5D).",

Elucidating the full picture of virus\u2013host interactions will be important for a complete understanding of the infection process and will likely require a large number of genomics and proteomic approaches. In this study, we explored the potential of SILAC\u2010based quantitative proteomics to contribute to our knowledge of virus\u2013host interactions. With this approach, changes in protein composition of the cell or in protein distribution among cellular organelles can be established. We hypothesized that proteins that are affected in their abundance or distribution upon infection are likely to be involved in the virus life cycle. Because of the known role of the secretory pathway and the Golgi apparatus in the infection cycle of the model CoV MHV 6, 16, 19, 39, we focused our attention on Golgi\u2010enriched fractions isolated from MHV\u2010 and mock\u2010infected cells. We found that 116 proteins were affected in their abundance in these fractions upon infection of cells with MHV. The functional relevance of these results was confirmed by siRNA\u2010mediated depletion, which for some proteins was shown to increase either MHV replication or production of progeny virus. Overexpression of several proteins resulted in decreased MHV replication.",

Most studies 44, 45, 46, 47 reduced sample complexity by performing cell fractionation to study changes in the proteome of cytoplasmic, nucleolar or crude membrane fractions upon infection of cells with influenza A, infectious bronchitis, or respiratory syncytial virus. Although these studies identified a large number of host proteins that changed in abundance due to the infection, the functional relevance of these proteins in the virus infection cycle was not studied in further detail. In another study, Zhang et al. 43 applied SILAC to compare the protein profiles of cells containing a SARS\u2010CoV replicon with those of parental cells, which resulted in the identification of 74 host factors that had significantly altered levels of expression. Functional studies on one of these proteins, BAG3, demonstrated that this protein plays an important role in SARS\u2010CoV replication. Although two previous studies 43, 46 focused on CoV\u2010induced changes in the host proteome, no identical hits were obtained in these and our studies. This is probably explained by the different CoVs, experimental systems and subcellular fractions used. For example, in contrast to our study, Zhang et al. 43 used cells containing a CoV replicon rather than virus\u2010infected cells. In addition, although we focused on Golgi\u2010enriched fractions, the other groups analyzed total cell lysates and/or nucleolar fractions 44, 45, 46, 47.",

Proteins annotated to be localized to ten different cellular compartments were found in the Golgi\u2010enriched fraction. This is not unexpected as our Golgi isolation procedure is based on the protocols of Wieland and colleagues 30 and Rothman and colleagues 38, who showed a 52\u2010fold enrichment for Golgi protein markers, with a 1\u20104\u2010fold enrichment of ER, plasma membrane and lysosomal protein markers. Also others have shown that isolation of a pure Golgi fraction is not possible 48, 49, 50, 51. For example, Wu et al. 50, identified 421 proteins in stacked Golgi membranes from rat liver, of which only 110 were Golgi resident proteins. Furthermore, proteins localizing primarily in other organelles than the Golgi may very well also be present in the Golgi, albeit probably at lower levels.",

This is in agreement with the results obtained by Neuman et al. 52, who identified several RNA\u2010binding and ribosomal proteins in purified SARS\u2010CoV virions. We hypothesize that upon infection with MHV, the ribosomal/nucleic acid\u2010binding proteins are specifically recruited to the virion assembly sites, possibly by their interaction with viral genomic RNA, resulting in their enrichment in the isolated fractions (this study) and their incorporation into progeny virus 52. In agreement with the idea that the isolated Golgi fraction contains the membranes at which the virions assemble, this fraction also contained the major CoV structural proteins M and N (data not shown).",

CoVs induce among others DMVs and convoluted membranes that are associated with the synthesis of viral RNA and to which the non\u2010structural proteins involved in RNA synthesis are localized 15, 39. As these non\u2010structural proteins could not be detected in the isolated Golgi\u2010enriched fraction (data not shown), it may well be that the proteins depleted from this fraction are recruited/redirected to these virally modified membranes.",

As depletion of C11orf59 by siRNAs positively affected luciferase expression driven by MHV, we hypothesize the protein to have a negative effect on viral RNA synthesis. In agreement herewith, overexpression of C11orf59 negatively affected MHV replication. These results indicate that C11orf59 plays a role in MHV replication. Although the depletion (2.2\u2010fold) of this protein from the isolated fraction upon infection may indicate that it is recruited to the sites of viral RNA synthesis, this could not be confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Alternatively, the degradation of this protein may be enhanced upon infection. C11orf59 was shown to have multiple functions 53, 54, 55, 56. Hoshino et al. found that C11orf59 acts as a RhoA activator 53. Inhibition of RhoA has been previously described to result in an increased Hepatitis C virus replication and enhanced vaccinia virus cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread 57, 58. Although depletion of the RhoA activator, C11orf59, led to increased MHV replication (this study), depletion of RhoA itself, which was expected to have a similar effect as depletion of its activator, resulted in decreased MHV replication (data not shown). C11orf59 was recently also shown to play a role in cholesterol homeostatis 56. As cholesterol is known to be important for CoV infection 59, 60, 61, perturbation of cholesterol homeostasis after depletion or overexpression of C11orf59 may explain the interference with CoV replication. In addition, others have demonstrated a role for C11orf59 in endosome dynamics, lysosome maturation and mTORC1 kinase activation 54, 55, 56. Clearly, further analysis of these different functions of the C11orf59 protein is required to determine how the presence or absence of this protein affects MHV replication.",

In agreement herewith, overexpression of GLG1 negatively affected MHV replication. GLG1 is a 150\u2010kD integral membrane protein localized to the Golgi apparatus 62. It is able to bind fibroblast growth factor, and may play a role in fibroblast growth factor signaling 63, 64. In addition, GLG1 is highly homologous to the murine E\u2010selectin ligand\u20101 65, 66 and to a membrane sialoglycoprotein of the medial cisternae of the rat Golgi complex (MG\u2010160) 67.

SEC22B is a protein involved in vesicular trafficking between the ER and the Golgi 68, 69, although depletion of this protein did not significantly affect secretion of Gaussia luciferase (this study). We speculate that in the absence of SEC22B, either assembly of MHV virions is more efficient or a higher proportion of the released particles is infectious. Overexpression of this protein might somehow interfere with the assembly and/or functioning of the membrane\u2010bound replication complexes. Unfortunately, the low transfection efficiency of the SEC22B\u2010GFP expression construct did not allow us to assess the assembly of MHV in cells overexpressing this protein.",
