            "text": "In recent years, emergence and re-emergence of serious infectious disease occurred frequently throughout the world. Relevant pathogens include Escherichia coli O157:H7, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, norovirus, rotavirus, swine-origin influenza A virus (H1N1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Annually, there are 1AE7 million deaths from diarrhoeal diseases and 1AE5 million deaths from respiratory infections worldwide (Nada and Gregory 2006) . For centuries, it was assumed that infectious diseases were spread primarily by the airborne route or through the direct patient contact, and the environmental surfaces played little or no significant role in the disease transmission (Goldmann 2000; Cozad and Jones 2003; Boone and Gerba 2007) . However, there is growing evidence that contaminated fomites or surfaces play a key role in the spread of viral infections (Barker et al. 2001; Hota 2004) . Influenza A virus was detected on over 50% of the fomites from bathrooms, kitchens, and play areas in homes and day care centres during the influenza season (Boone and Gerba 2005) . Norovirus was detected on swabs taken from kitchen and bathroom surfaces in five outbreaks (Boxman et al. 2009a,b) . Furthermore, the home environment, such as the kitchen and bathroom, serves as a reservoir of large numbers of microbes, particularly Enterobacteriaceae, and the infectious disease transmission has been demonstrated to occur in 6-60% of households in which one member is ill (Kagan et al. 2002) . From these reports, we focused on the reduction in microbes on environmental surfaces, particularly, under moist conditions. In this report, to evaluate the disinfecting activity of a low-concentration chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 , CAS no. 10049-04-4) gas, we set up a test room (39 m 3 ) and used four types of model microbes such as influenza A virus (Flu-A, enveloped virus), feline calicivirus (FCV, a norovirus surrogate, nonenveloped virus), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, Gram-positive bacterium) and Escherichia coli (E. coli, Gram-negative bacterium).",

            "text": "ClO 2 is a strong oxidant and a yellow to reddish-yellow gas at room temperature (Budavari 2001 dissolves readily in water at room temperature. The aqueous ClO 2 has been used as a disinfectant, and it has been widely used for drinking water treatment in North America (Gates 1998) . Recently, antibacterial and antifungal activities have been reported for gaseous ClO 2 (Lee et al. 2004; Sy et al. 2005; Wilson et al. 2005) . However, the concentration of ClO 2 gas used in previous reports to inactivate bacteria and fungi was extremely high (250-3500 ppmv); its concentration was much higher than a lethal concentration 50% kill (LC 50 ) value (32 ppmv, 90 mg m )3 ) in rats as a single exposure (Dobson 2002) . Little is known whether a low-concentration ClO 2 gas has an antibacterial and antiviral activity. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that a low-concentration ClO 2 gas (mean 0AE08 ppmv, 0AE22 mg m )3 ) inactivated FCV on a hard surface in the dry state within 10 h in 75-85% 'high' relative humidity (r.h.) (>3 log10 reductions), but had little virucidal effect in 45-55% 'moderate' r.h. (Morino et al. 2009 ). These results suggest that the atmospheric moisture plays an important role in the inactivation by a low-concentration ClO 2 gas of FCV on hard surfaces. The moisture may be indispensable for a lowconcentration ClO 2 gas to inactivate microbes on hard surfaces. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of a lowconcentration ClO 2 gas against model microbes in the wet state on a glass surface, which means without any drying process.",

Hundred microlitres of microbe suspension was placed on glass dishes (5 cm diameter). Drying was not performed for bacteria or viruses in the wet state. These preparations were placed in the test room as described later and were exposed to ClO 2 gas or ordinary air for 5 h (organic load experiments).

However, these procedures have a number of disadvantages, such as acute toxicity induced by inhalation of the disinfectant vapours and skin inflammation by contact with these disinfectants. In this study, we demonstrated that a low-concentration ClO 2 gas (mean 0AE05 ppmv) inactivated E. coli, Flu-A (>5 log 10 reductions) and S. aureus, FCV (>2 log 10 reductions) in the wet state within 5 h. These results suggest that the low-concentration ClO 2 may inactivate various kinds of microbes such as Grampositive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, enveloped viruses, and nonenveloped viruses in the wet state. According to the International Chemical Safety Card, the threshold limit values for ClO 2 gas are 0AE1 ppmv as an 8 h time-weighted average and 0AE3 ppmv as a 15-min short-term exposure limit (Dobson 2002) ; the concentration of ClO 2 gas (0AE05 ppmv) used to inactivate microbes in this study was lower than these concentrations (0AE1 and 0AE3 ppmv). Previous studies suggest that the environmental surfaces, particularly under moist conditions, play a key role in the spread of viral infections and serve as a reservoir of various microbes (Barker et al. 2001; Boone and Gerba 2005; Boxman et al. 2009a,b; Hota 2004; Kagan et al. 2002) . The gaseous agents show features of excellent diffusibility and penetrability, making it possible to access sites that are difficult to disinfect with conventional liquid agents. In other words, these features make it possible for the gas to disinfect widely dispersed sources of infection. The treatment of wet environments in the presence of human activity, such as kitchens and bath-rooms, with the low-concentration ClO 2 gas would be useful for reducing the risk of infection by bacteria and viruses on the environment surfaces without adverse effects.",

In fact, we found that a ClO 2 solution was more effective against enveloped viruses than nonenveloped viruses (Sanekata et al. 2010) . Similarly, antiviral activity of the low-concentration ClO 2 gas was higher against enveloped viruses than nonenveloped viruses (Fig. 3) . In the case of bacteria, a ClO 2 solution was more effective against E. coli (Gram-negative) than S. aureus (Gram-positive) (Toda et al. 2006) . Similarly, antibacterial activity of the low-concentration ClO 2 gas was higher against E. coli than S. aureus (Fig. 2) . It is known that a ClO 2 solution loses its bactericidal activity in the presence of organic substances. In this report, the low-concentration ClO 2 gas also decreased its antimicrobial activity in the presence of organic substances (up to 1% FBS), except for Flu-A (Table 1) . Taken together, the findings from research on antimicrobial activity of a ClO 2 solution may be utilized to simulate the activity of lowconcentration ClO 2 gas against various kinds of microbes. Additional studies will be needed to clarify the relationship between the antimicrobial activity of a ClO 2 solution and that of low-concentration ClO 2 gas. Regarding the mechanism of inactivation of microbes by ClO 2 , Ogata (2007) discussed that the inactivation of microbes by ClO 2 was caused by the oxidative modification of their tryptophan and tyrosine residues. The difference in the efficacy of ClO 2 against microbes described earlier may be due to the difference in the reactivity of ClO 2 against Inactivation of microbes by low-concentration ClO 2 gas H. Morino et al. tryptophan and tyrosine residues on key proteins that are indispensable to the growth of bacteria and to the infectivity of viruses. Staphylococcus aureus is the most important pathogen among staphylococci. Traditionally, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections have occurred predominantly in hospitals. However, there has been an increasing incidence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections for recent years (Otto 2010) . Recently, Scott et al. reported that MRSA was found on a variety of household surfaces, including the kitchen and bathroom sinks as wet environments (Scott et al. 2008 (Scott et al. , 2009 . Although the efficacy of low-concentration ClO 2 gas against MRSA was not determined in this report, the efficacy of low-concentration ClO 2 gas against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) showed reductions of >2 log 10 after 5 h as compared with control values (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, inactivation of a ClO 2 solution against MRSA was nearly equal to that against MSSA (S. Yamasaki and A. Hinenoya 2011, personal communication). These results suggest that the low-concentration ClO 2 gas may have an inactivation activity against MRSA and CA-MRSA. Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality among human populations worldwide. In April 2009, the swine-origin Flu-A (H1N1) first appeared in Mexico and spread worldwide, presumably as a result of frequent, intercontinental airplane travels. In June 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic level to the highest level of phase 6. The pandemic caused many hospitalizations and deaths world-wide (Al Hajjar and McIntosh 2010) . In this study, the efficacy of lowconcentration ClO 2 gas against the swine-origin Flu-A (H1N1) was not determined. However, the efficacy of low-concentration ClO 2 gas against identical subtype Flu-A (H1N1) strain New Caledonia \u2044 20 \u2044 99 resulted in the reduction in viral activity below the detection limit after 3 h (Fig. 3a ). In addition, the inactivation of a ClO 2 solution against swine-origin Flu-A (H1N1) was nearly equal to that against Flu-A (H1N1) strain New Caledonia \u2044 20 \u2044 99 (Fukuda et al. 2011) . These results suggest that the low-concentration ClO 2 gas may inactive the swine-origin Flu-A (H1N1). Boone and Gerba (2005) reported that Flu-A was detected from over 50% of the fomites collected from wet environments such as bathrooms and kitchens in homes and day care centres during the influenza season. From these data, we propose that the low-concentration ClO 2 gas would be useful for reducing the risk of MRSA and swine-origin Flu-A infections in wet environments such as kitchens and bathrooms, without necessitating the evacuation of residents.",

In the efficacy experiment of ClO 2 gas for S. aureus and FCV, the effect of ClO 2 gas exposed for 3-5 h (Fig. 2b) and 4-5 h (Fig. 3b) did not significantly differ from the natural reduction in these microorganisms over time during these late-phase period of time courses. This finding may be due to that, in this experiment, the residual amounts of water were 100 ll (initial), 59 \u00b1 5 ll (after 1 h), 26 \u00b1 8 ll (after 2 h), 9 \u00b1 8 ll (after 3 h), 3 \u00b1 3 ll (after 4 h) and <2 ll (after 5 h). Therefore, the remaining amount of water beyond 3 h was less than 10% of the initial amount. It is likely that the effect of ClO 2 gas may be influenced by various factors such as inoculum volume, inoculum surface area, humidity, temperature and airflow. However, we were unable to investigate the effect of these factors in detail, because this study focused mainly on the simulation of realistic circumstances, employing a practical assessment system (test room, 39 m 3 ). In the future, with respect to the effect of ClO 2 gas and the factors that affect such effect, a further study that enables the detailed investigation will be needed, using, for example, a small size chamber in which the temperature and the humidity can be strictly regulated.",
