Part of a new clone and a previously reported clone were sequenced and used to construct the viral gene for integral membrane protein. A single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 262 amino acids, relative molecular mass (Mr) 29459, was identified. The positive identification of the polypeptide as the integral membrane protein was demonstrated by the production in E. coli of a chimaeric protein comprising most of the ORF encoding the M^ 29459 polypeptide and p-galactosidase. The chimaeric protein reacted with a specific monoclonal antibody to viral integral membrane protein and antibodies raised against the chimaeric protein immune precipitated the viral protein. Comparison with the sequence of an avirulent isolate indicates amino acid residues that may be important in pathogenicity.",

            "text": "TGEV is a coronavirus that causes gastroenteritis in pigs, resulting in a high mortality in neonates. TGEV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, a large group of pleomorphic enveloped viruses with a positive-stranded RNA genome. The coronavirus proteins are expressed from a 'nested' set of subgenomic mRNAs which have common 3' termini but different 5' extensions. The region of each mRNA responsible for the expression of a protein appears to correspond to the 5'-terminal region that is absent on the preceding smaller species. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) mRNA species con-tain identical short non-coding sequences at their 5' ends which appear to be joined to the sequences encoding the viral genes by discontinuous transcription. A consensus sequence identified upstream of each gene/ORF may act as a binding site for the RNA polymerase-leader complex (Spaan et al.. 1983; Brown et al., 1984; Lai et aL, 1984; Budzilowicz et at., 1985; Shieh et at., 1987) . It has been postulated that a heptameric sequence, ACTAAAC (Britton ef a/., 1988), or a hexameric sequence, CTAAAC (Kapke and Brian, 1986; Rasschaert efa/., 1987a; 19B7b) , may be involved in the binding of the TGEV RNA polymerase-leader complex for the transcription of the mRNA species from the negative form of the RNA genome.",

Plasmid pF4F-36 was found to hybridize, by Northern blot analysis, tp all the TGEV mRNA species except the 0.7 kb species, postulated to express a polypeptide of M, 9000 found at the 3' end of the viral genome (Britton et al., 1988) . Plasmid pTG22 did not hybridize to either the 0.7 kb or 1.7 kb mRNA species, indicating that it originated within the 2.6 kb mRNA species previously shown, by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, to express the TGEV integral membrane protein (Britton et ai., 1986; Jacobs etai., 1986) . From the size and position of the cDNA insert on the TGEV genome, pF4F-36 was deduced to contain about 80% of the integral membrane protein. Plasmid pTG22 is 2.5 kbp long and from its restriction map was shown to overlap pF4F-36 ( Fig. 1) and extend 4.6 kb into the TGEV genome, thus completing the cloning of the integral membrane protein gene.",

The black dots above asparagine residues indicate potential W-glycosylation sites. The broken lines refer to areas of homology between the four integral membrane proteins derived by dot-matrix analysis (Fig. 5) , The thick black line represents the postulated membrane-spanning regions.

This was then ligated into the H/ndlll site of the lacZ gene in plasmid pUR290. The 0.88kbp Fspl fragment consisted of the TGEV integral membrane protein gene 39 bp downstream from the start of the gene to the Fspl site 113bp from the BamHI site in pBR322. This resulted in removal of DNA encoding most of the amino acids from the signal sequence at the N-terminal end of the protein. The recombinant plasmid pURIM-2 expressed a chimaeric protein of M, 140000, upon induction with IPTG, which consisted of part of the TGEV integral membrane protein fused to the C-terminal end of p-galactosidase. A specific monoclonal antibody to the integral membrane protein from the Purdue strain of TGEV, 3BB3, reacted with the chimaeric protein by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A) . The chimaeric protein was purified from SDSpolyacrylamide gels and used to raise antibodies in mice. The antibodies immune-precipitated the TGEV integral membrane protein, further confirming that the cDNA encoded the viral integral membrane protein gene (Fig.  4B ).",

            "text": "The complete integral membrane protein gene (from a British field isolate of TGEV) was cloned over two cDNA fragments and then sequenced. A major ORF of 786bp was identified in the viral-sense strand. The initiation codon of the ORF was preceded by the heptameric sequence, ACTAAAC, vi^hich was previously described as preceding both the TGEV nucleoprotein gene and an ORF encoding a poiypeptide of Mr 9068 at the 3' end of the virai genome. The 786 bp ORF encoded a primary transiation product of 262 amino acids vi/ith a M, 29 459. The first 17 amino acids fulfil the criteria of being a eukaryotic signal sequence, having a net charge following the W-terminus and a hydrophobic uncharged region of 14 amino acids (McGeoch, 1985; Von Heijne, 1986) . The cleavage site, identified by Laude et al. (1987) for the Purdue strain of TGEV, is located betvi^een a glutamic acid and an arginine residue. The signal sequence is predicted to fall between the glycine (16) and glutamic acid (17) residues (score = 10.2) by the weight-matrix rule of Von Heijne (1986), which predicts 75 to 80% of eukaryotic signal sequences. The ORF encoding the polypeptide of Mr 29459 was confirmed as the TGEV integral membrane protein gene by constructing a fusion between most of the 786 bp ORF and the E coli lacZ gene In a similar way to that described for the TGEV nucleoprotein gene (Britton et at., 1987) . The gene fusion resulted in the synthesis, in E coli cells, of a polypeptide of M, 140000 composed of p-galactosidase with most of the TGEV integral membrane protein gene attached to the C-terminal end. A monoclonal antibody, 3BB3, specific for TGEV integral membrane protein interacted with the chimaeric polypeptide, and antibodies raised against the chimaera precipitated the integral membrane protein from TGEV-infected cells. This confirmed that the 786 bp ORF, predicted to direct the synthesis of a polypeptide of Mr 29459, was the viral integral membrane protein gene.",

            "text": "Comparison of the M, 29459 product, using a dotmatrix analysis program (DIAGON; Staden, 1982) , with the integral membrane proteins from MHV, IBV and BCV in a pairwise manner revealed remarkable homology between the proteins (Fig. 5 ). There are four major areas of homology between the integral membrane proteins of TGEV (FS772/70), MHV (A59) and BOV (Mebus), whereas there are oniy two regions of homology between TGEV and IBV (Beaudette) as also seen between IBV and either MHV or BCV (Fig. 5) . The homology between MHV and BCV is almost 100%, indicating that the two viruses probably share recent common ancestral evolution. From the homoiogies between the integral membrane proteins, this paper, and the nucleoproteins, Britton et al. (1988) , it is clear that TGEV and MHV share a more recent ancestral evolution than either virus with IBV and it will be interesting to compare homologies with other coronaviruses once their gene sequences have been completed. Direct alignment of the integral membrane proteins from TGEV strains FS772/70 (virulent) and Purdue (avirulent) with MHV (A59), BCV (Mebus) and IBV (Beaudette) using the GAP program {Devereux et ai, 1984) identified the position of identical amino acids between different viruses or in some cases between all fourviruses (Fig. 6) , which are indicated on the deduced amino acid sequence of TGEV integral membrane protein (Fig. 3) . The optimal alignment identified a perfectly conserved eight-amino-acid sequence, SWWSFNPE, between all four viruses (Figs 3 and 6) . The alignment of the amino acid sequences alloweci the identification of the three membrane-spanning regions for TGEV by deduction from the regions identified for MHV (Rottier et ai, 1986) . These are shown as thick black lines on Figs 3 and 6. The regions consist of very similar amino acids between TGEV and MHV, indicating that the regions are weli conserved between viruses, with very few changes between strains of the same virus. Anaiysis of the hydropathicity (Kyte and Dooiittie, 1982) of the TGEV integral membrane protein identified five hydrophobic regions. The first region, covering amino acids 1-17. is the putative signal sequence. The next three regions, covering amino acids 54-74, 80-100 and 114-134, are the three postulated membrane-spanning regions identified from Fig. 6 . The fifth hydrophobic region, covering amino acids 150-220, is the one postulated to interact with the inside of the viral envelope. The remaining 42 residues at the C-terminus have an overall hydrophilic nature similar to the region seen in MHV, and may interact with the nucleoprotein. Thus It is possible to predict the membrane topology of the TGEV integral membrane protein from the DNA sequence data when compared to those of other coronaviruses.",

There are three potential W-glycosylation sites within the integral membrane protein: at asparagine positions 32, 55 and 251, as deduced from the DNA sequence for TGEV. The first two are at the amino terminal of the polypeptide (Fig. 3) although the second site (Asn-55) falls within the first predicted membrane-spanning region (Figs  3 and 6) , as determined from alignment with MHV, and so It may not be glycosylated. The third potential glycosylation site is at the carboxy-terminal end of the polypeptide, predicted to be found inside the virion, and so it may not be glycosylated. The prediction that only the first A/-glycosylation site is functional would give rise to a polypeptide of Mf 29000-30000, a size close to the major species identified by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of either TGEV-infected cells or purified virions, since the presence of an W-Nnked glycan may add up to 2000 to the molecular weight of a poiypeptide (Klenk and Rott, 1980) .

The primer corresponded to a complementary sequence 13bp upstream from the 5' end of the nucleoprotein gene, derived from the sequence data reported by Britton et al. (1988) , and was synthesized by the phosphoramldite method using an Applied Biosystems model 381A DNA synthesizer. Second-strand synthesis was carried out as described by Britton ef al. (1988) . Following second-Strand synthesis, oligo-dC tails were added to the cDNA molecules using 25 U terminal transferase at 1 S^C for 2 min. The dC-tailed cDNA molecules were annealed to oligo(dG)tailed pUC9 (Pharmacia) at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. After 4 h at 58''C. they were transformed into competent DH1 E. coli cells. Transformants containing TGEV cDNA were Identified by colony hybridization, as described by Britton et al.
