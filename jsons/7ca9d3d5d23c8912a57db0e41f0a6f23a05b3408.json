            "text": "Background: Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease . Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COviD-19. we aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COviD-19. Methods: A search was conducted across eMBASe and MeDLiNe databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (Aes) grade 1-4, serious Aes and discontinuation for Aes. Specific Aes of interest highlighted in earlyphase studies, including gastrointestinal Aes and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. Results: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1-4 Aes on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to Aes on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious Aes the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal Aes occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001]. Conclusions: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious Aes. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COviD-19.",

New therapeutic options are needed now but are limited by a lack of evidence and require time to develop. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. while there is no licensed treatment that specifically acts against COviD-19, medications such as broad-spectrum antivirals are being employed as experimental adjuncts to supportive care [1] . Potential drugs that may be repurposed include antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, antiretrovirals lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir, and influenza drugs oseltamivir, remdesivir and favipiravir [2] [3] [4] . These drugs are now being trialled globally in different combinations for the treatment of COviD-19.
