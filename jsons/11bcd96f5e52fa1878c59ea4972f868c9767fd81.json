The search for etiology was fueled by the desire to prevent incident cases and this was coupled with the belief that scarce resources were needed for the lifelong care of individuals with MR. Research related to the search for causation requires a multidisciplinary approach, including the fields of neuroscience, genetics, epidemiology, and numerous medical specialties.",

The primary source of population-based data is household surveys. The United States conducts the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (National Center for Health Statistics, n.d.) which includes questions about impairments including MR. Administrative registries are often used to describe population rates of MR but these should be carefully interpreted because the criteria for participation in the program and its registry of needs vary. Some state and local programs are entitlements for eligible citizens, but not all citizens with the condition agree to be tested and deemed eligible. Other state programs are need-based with both economic and disability determinations. Thus, administrative registries are often not complete counts of individuals with MR but represent a combination of needy citizens and selective eligibility.",

Adaptive behavior has become a second measurable component of the definition over the last 25 years and is viewed as a set of social and practical skills that have been learned by people to function independently.

This categorization groups mild MR to an IQ range of 55-69, moderate MR to an IQ range of 40-54, severe MR to an IQ range of 25-39, and profound MR to an IQ below 25, although these subcategories have been omitted from the definition developed by AAMR (1992 AAMR ( , 2002 and retained in a definition disseminated by the MR/DD division of the APA (Editorial Board, 1996) . The ICD, now in its 10th edition, was developed by the WHO to code health disorders, including impairments and disabilities (WHO, 1992) . The ICD-10 is widely used by physicians and other health-care providers to code specific syndromes and impairments associated with MR, such as Down Syndrome (DS), Prader-Willi, Fragile X, and to code the level of intellectual disability (mild, moderate, and severe). The ICD codes are often combined with clinical procedure and therapeutic codes that are used for billing purposes. The DSM (APA, 1994) is used by U.S. psychiatrists to classify mental illnesses and is often considered analogous to the ICD for the field of psychiatry. The DSM includes MR (IQ and age of onset), the use of IQ ranges for levels of MR, and the assessment of adaptive skills as the defining criteria for diagnosis.",

The proportion in each category varies by the method of case acquisition, with schoolbased records favoring high proportions of mild cases and institutional registries reporting high proportions of severe and profound cases. Registries for adult services tend to report relatively more cases with moderate to severe MR than indicated by the proportions above. In addition, there are different proportions of severity by underlying impairment. For example, girls with Rett syndrome have a high proportion with severe and profound MR, while the range of intellectual disability is much wider for individuals with DS. There are also geographic and temporal variations that are a function of epidemics (e.g., rubella, influenza), poverty levels, environmental conditions (e.g., lead and mercury exposure), and access to prevention programs (e.g., early intervention for infants at risk, immunizations, dietary and therapeutic interventions).",

Changes in scores greater than one standard deviation are usually attributed to removal of deprivation followed by intervention involving social and learning stimulation during early childhood (Clarke & Clarke, 1976; Dennis, 1973; Lazar & Darlington, 1982) . In addition, the assumption of a normal distribution of IQ scores that underlie the assignment of an IQ of 70 as a cut point for MR is not based on epidemiological investigation. The empirical distribution obtained by researchers doing large-scale studies (e.g., Vernon, 1979; Zigler, 1967) has been bimodal with a second smaller peak in the lower tail of the curve. The explanation for this phenomenon is that there are two distributions of intelligence. One is for those whose intelligence is the result of an interaction of genetic and environmental influences and the other in which the brain has been damaged and the biological side of the interaction dominates (Lewis & Goldberg 1969; Zigler, 1967) . The smaller mode in the left end of the distribution represents biologically induced MR. Many critics of intelligence testing and assignment of mental age argue that abstract intelligence cannot be forced into a linear model. The same argument has been applied to tests of adaptive functioning, which have been shown to have nonlinear progression (Jacobson & Mulick, 1996) .",

These definitions, however, are not yet consistently used in the epidemiologic literature and there is little uniformity in their use in the service, medical, or educational arenas. Thus, it is important to recognize that although the AAMR definition of MR is widely known, many epidemiological studies of the prevalence of MR do not use measures of adaptive behavior and they most commonly report two categories of IQ. Epidemiologists use the term \"mild'' for an IQ between 50 and 70. They categorize all IQs below 50 as \"severe'' MR.",

Uneven prevalence rates throughout the lifespan are a result of delayed diagnosis for some mild cases, early death for some severe cases, and omission of mild cases from service registries during adulthood.

The prevalence of MR in the United States during late childhood has been reported to be 1-2% of the population during the past decade, but there is substantial variation in the literature (Durkin & Stein, 1996) . In the Netherlands, Sweden, and other countries, national registries track people throughout their lifetime in an effort to identify health, social problems, and service utilization and thus the disability associated with MR is captured more effectively (Kiely, 1987; Stein, Susser, Saenger, & Marolla, 1976) . The United States has a birth defects surveillance system that captures only those cases identified in the first days of life, but the United States does not have a national disability registry; therefore prevalence rates for MR are usually calculated from cross-sectional data on children in public schools (Frankenberger & Harper, 1988; McDermott, 1994; McLaren & Bryson, 1987; Yeargin-Allsopp & Boyle, 2002) .",

Reports from the U.S. Department of Education include the number of children, aged 5-21, enrolled in special education programs and there are two and sometimes three programs for children with MR: Educable Mental Deficiency (EMD), Trainable Mental Deficiency (TMD), and Severe Mental Deficiency (SMD). In addition, some children with multiple disabling conditions are placed in other special education programs, i.e., multiply disabled, speech and language, orthopedic, or vision or hearing impairment, and are only counted in the one program with the highest level of reimbursement to the district, leading to an undercount of MR. Federal guidelines for placement of children with MR provide a definition of MR that includes significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, with deficits in adaptive behavior. States provide guidance to local school districts in matters of referral, testing, and placement procedures. Research has shown that there are small-area (school district and county level) and large-area (national and state level) variations in MR prevalence rates (Baird & Sadovnick, 1987; Kiely, 1987; McDermott, 1994) . The most widely used U.S. estimate of school-aged prevalence of MR is given in the Healthy People 2010 Objectives for the Nation (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000). The Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance System (MADDS) has set the benchmark for national prevalence of childhood MR at 131/10,000 8-year-old children, using an estimate from the 1991-1994 MADDS data (Yeargin-Allsopp & Boyle, 2002; Yeargin-Allsopp, Murphy, Cordero, Decoufle, & Hollowell, 1997) .",

Even gross genetic factors such as DS or mutation of a gene, can be viewed as highly associated with MR although not absolutely causal. In fact, with early intervention services some children with DS function in the low normal range on tests of IQ are not classified as having MR until they qualify for services later in childhood.

Structural changes result from the breakage and rearrangement of chromosome parts, and animal experiments have shown that they can be induced by a variety of exposures, including ionizing radiation and certain viral infections and toxic substances. They occur as duplications, deletions, translocations, insertions, or inversions of chromosome parts or as rings on selected chromosomes. Numerical anomalies arise through nondisjunction during meiosis or mitosis, through lagging of chromosomes at anaphase of cell division, or through fertilization by two sperm (i.e., triploidy). Chromosomal anomalies as a whole contribute more to fetal loss than to live births and MR. Kline, Stein, and Susser (1989) estimated that from 8 weeks after the last menstrual period, the proportion of chromosomal aberrations lost by miscarriage exceeds 90% for all but trisomy 21 (DS), XXX, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), and XYY. In survivors after birth in developed countries, chromosomal anomalies cause more than 30% of the cases of severe MR, with the majority of these having DS (Gustavson, Hagberg, Hagberg, & Sars, 1977a , 1977b . In humans, de novo (presumed mutant) chromosomal rearrangements, whether balanced or unbalanced, occur in 2/1000 live births. This estimate is based on 63,000 fetal amniocenteses, which were diagnosed in the New York State Chromosome Registry (Hook & Cross, 1987) . Of these, about 0.5 per 1000 are de novo markers; about 0.5 per 1000 other de novo unbalanced translocations and about 1.0 per 1000 de novo balanced rearrangements. The rate of inherited rearrangements was about 2.9 per 1000, including 0.3 per 1000 inherited markers, 0.2 per 1000 other inherited unbalanced rearrangements, and about 2.4 per 1000 inherited balanced abnormalities. Among fetuses studied because of maternal exposure to putative mutagens, there was an excess of mutants, 2.9-5.7 per 1000 versus 1.7-2.2 per 1000 (Hook & Cross, 1987) . These findings suggest that workplace or environmental exposures may increase risk of structural cytogenetic abnormalities in the fetus that, in turn, may be associated with birth defects and neurodevelopmental delay in the infant. Warburton (1984 Warburton ( , 1987 Warburton ( , 1991 reported the results of a 10-year collection of data from a series of over 377,000 amniocenteses in which the occurrence rate of de novo balanced reciprocal translocations, Robertsonian translocations, and inversions was estimated to be about 1 per 1000. The most common de novo balanced chromosomal anomalies were de novo reciprocal translocations (1 per 2000). The overall risk of a serious congenital anomaly, including but not limited to MR, for balanced reciprocal translocations and inversions was 6.7% (95% CI 3.1-10.3%). In this same study, de novo supernumerary markers were found in 1 in 2500 amniocenteses, and had a risk of approximately 15% of being associated with an abnormal fetal outcome. De novo unbalanced rearrangements, including supernumerary small markers, have been estimated to occur in about 1 in 1000 amniocenteses which were carried out for reasons other than suspected fetal anomalies (Hook & Cross, 1987) . This rate increased to 1.8 per 1000 when amniocentesis was performed because of known or suspected fetal pathology.",

            "text": "However, these rates are based on cytogenetic methods that may miss small deletions or translocations and underestimate the impact of chromosomal anomalies on neurodevelopmental disorders. There is mounting evidence that chromosomal rearrangements involving the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes contribute to moderate to severe MR and are associated with dysmorphic phenotypic features (Flint et al., 1995; Knight et al., 1999) . Flint and his colleagues (Knight et al., 1999) reported that subtelomeric abnormalities, requiring microassays or FISH to be detected, occurred in 7.4% (95% CI 4.4-10.4) of 284 children with previously unexplained moderate to severe MR. About half of the subtelomeric rearrangement cases were familial and the other half were isolated, apparently de novo cases. Approximately 10% of the de novo rearrangements had abnormal outcomes. In both the familial and de novo groups approximately 60% of the chromosomal anomalies were paternal and 40% were maternal in origin. If cases are selected to include dysmorphic features as well as developmental delay, chromosomal aberrations may be found in as many as 13.0% (Popp et al., 2002) . On the other hand, van Karnebeek et al. (2002) screened 266 children in a consecutive cohort of cases with unexplained MR presenting to an academic tertiary center for diagnosis and found that the total frequency of cytogenetic anomalies was 10%, but the frequency of subtelomeric rearrangements was low (0.5%, van Karnebeek et al., 2002) . Thus, screening for subtelomeric rearrangements is likely to be most effective when combined with targeted selection criteria, including unexplained MR, dysmorphic features, and a positive family history with two or more affected individuals (Popp et al., 2002) .",

The most common form (95% of cases at birth) is standard trisomy, involving duplication of chromosome 21. In over 90% of these cases, the extra chromosome is of maternal origin, due to nondisjunction during meiosis (Hassold, Chiu, & Yamane, 1984; Sherman et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1988) . Translocation of chromosome 21 material to another chromosome (usually 13 or 18) and mosaicism (transmission of a cryptic trisomy 21 cell line from an unaffected parent) are rare causes of DS (Hook, 1982; Staples, Sutherland, Haan, & Clisby, 1991) .",

Despite this strong association with maternal age, most DS births are to women aged less than 35 years because younger women contribute the great majority of births.

Recently, variants in two folate metabolizing enzymes, the 677C \u2192 T polymorphism in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR) and the 66A \u2192 G polymorphism in the gene for methionine reductase (MTRR), have been found to be more prevalent among mothers of children with DS than among control mothers (Hobbs et al., 2000; James et al., 1999; O'Leary et al., 2002) . The combined presence of both the MTHFR and MTRR polymorphisms increased risk of having child with DS to a greater extent than either polymorphism alone (Hobbs et al., 2000; O'Leary et al., 2002) . The MTHFR 677C \u2192 T mutation affects both folate metabolism and cellular methylation reactions. James and colleagues hypothesized that gene-nutrient interactions associated with abnormal folate metabolism and reduced DNA methylation might increase risk of nondisjunction DS (Hobbs et al., 2000; James et al., 1999) . As Hobbs has noted, the reduction in enzyme activity in carriers of the 677C \u2192 T mutation may raise dietary requirements for folic acid. This is the first risk factor to be identified for DS in young women and raises the possibility of intervention and prevention for DS (Hassold et al., 2001) .",

The most extensively studied aspect of aging in DS is their high risk for the development of AD. Virtually all individuals with DS have key neuropathological changes consistent with a diagnosis of AD by the time they reach 40 years of age, including deposition of beta amyloid (A\u03b2) in diffuse and neuritic plaques (Wisniewski, Wegiel, & Popovitch, 1994) , and most will develop dementia by the end of their seventh decade of life (Lai et al., 1999) . The neuropathological manifestations of AD in DS have been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP) located on chromosome 21 (Rumble et al., 1989) . The increased risk of dementia in DS may be mediated by an increased substrate for cellular production of A\u03b2. Neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent \"Alzheimer-type'' lesion seen in individuals with DS before age 50, are not associated with dementia. In contrast, increase in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillized A\u03b2 peptides, is observed in adults with DS predominantly after 50 years of age (Wisniewski et al., 1994) and all incidence studies agree that risk of AD increases primarily after 50 years of age (Holland, Hon, Huppert, & Watson, 1998; Lai et al., 1999; Visser et al., 1997) . In addition, not all adults with DS will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles can be presumed. Thus, factors, which modify the rate and degree of A\u03b2 deposition, rather than overexpression of APP, may be the important determinants of risk for dementia in DS (Schupf & Sergievsky, 2002) .",

In addition to cognitive disability, the fra(X) phenotype includes macroorchidism, a long face, prominent jaw, large ears, thickening of the nasal bridge, and joint hypermobility. Behavioral abnormalities may include autistic-like features, repetitive speech patterns, social anxiety, perseveration, and gaze aversion (Brown, Jenkins, & Friedman, 1982; Hagerman & Silverman, 1991; Opitz & Sutherland, 1984; Reiss & Freund, 1990) . Neuroimaging has demonstrated a small posterior cerebellar vermis, and enlarged hippocampus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, and lateral ventricles and Reiss and colleagues have shown correlations between these structural abnormalities and IQ (Reiss, Abrams, Greenlaw, Freund, & Denckla, 1995; Reiss, Aylward, Freund, Joshi, & Bryan, 1991; Reiss, Lee, & Freund, 1994) . A fragile site on the X chromosome, fra(X), was first identified in males from families with X-linked MR (Lubs, 1969; Sutherland, 1977) . The proportion of cells showing the fragile X site in cytogenetic studies is quite variable and may be characteristic of each individual. About 80% of male carriers of the mutation and about 30% of female carriers show some degree of MR (Chudley et al., 1983; Sherman, Morton, Jacobs, & Turner, 1984) .",

At the molecular level the FRAXA site contains an exon of the FMR1 gene responsible for the fragile X, a repetitive CGG sequence, which demonstrates length variation in normal and in fra(X) individuals, and a cytidine phosphate guanosine (CpG) island that shows preferential methylation in fra(X) cases (Bell et al., 1991; Vincent et al., 1991) . The length of the CGG repeat in genomic DNA is correlated with risk for the fragile X syndrome . Normal individuals have CGG repeat lengths of 6-50 repeats and affected individuals show dramatic amplification of the CGG repeat (from 200 to 1000) and hypermethylation of the repeat and adjacent CpG region, resulting in a shutdown of transcription of FMR1 and absence of the FMR1 protein (Bell et al., 1991; Oberle et al., 1991; Pieretti et al., 1991; Sutcliffe et al., 1992; Verheij et al., 1993) . The full mutation, when fully methylated, results in cognitive disability in all males and in 50-70% of affected females (de Vries et al., 1997; Hagerman et al., 1992; Rousseau et al., 1994) .",

As amplification of the gene increases, it becomes more unstable, leading to mitotic instability as well as meiotic instability Oberle et al., 1991; Pieretti et al., 1991) . The mitotic instability of the full repeat causes longer and shorter expansions, resulting in mosaicism with respect to size (premutation together with a full mutation) or with respect to degree of methylation (from 10 to 100% of leukocytes with an unmethylated full mutation). Several cases of intellectually normal males with a high proportion of unmethylated leukocytes have been reported, suggesting that methylation is critical for lack of transcription of FMR1 gene and expression of the phenotype (de Vries et al., 1996; Hagerman, Hull et al., 1994; Nolin, Glicksman, Houck, Brown, & Dobkin, 1994; Rousseau et al., 1994) . In addition, several cases have been found with atypical mutations at the FRAXA site, two involving a deletion and one a point mutation in the FRM1 gene (Gedeon et al., 1992; Wohrle et al., 1992) . Other fragile sites (FRAXE, FRAXD, FRAXF) are found close to the FRAXA site. FRAXE is associated with learning disabilities, but is caused by a different expanding trinucleotide repeat (Feldman, 1996) .",

The frequency of WS has been estimated to be about 1/10,000 live births (Beuren, Apitz, & Harmajanz, 1962; Williams, Barratt-Boyes, & Lowe, 1961) . Individuals with WS have an approximately 2 Mb deletion of chromosomal region 7q11.23 (Ewart et al., 1993; Perez-Jurado, Peoples, Kaplan, Hamel, & Francke, 1996) . Variability in deletion size may be related to variable phenotypic presentation. The majority of patients with WS is hemizygous for 7q11.23 and in more than 90% of cases, the deletion includes the locus for the elastin gene (ELN), a protein kinase LIM-kinase1 (LIMK1), and a replication factor C subunit (RFC2) (Frangiskakis et al., 1996; Osborne et al., 1996; Peoples, Perez-Jurado, Wang, Kaplan, & Francke, 1996) . Families with \"partial WS,'' involving smaller deletions that include only ELN and LIMK1, show the cognitive and cardiovascular profiles but lack other features of WS, suggesting that the loss of at least three genes is required for the full WS phenotype (Budarf & Emanuel, 1997; Frangiskakis et al., 1996) . There is no evidence of imprinting in WS, but if the gene deletion is of maternal origin, patients have more severe growth retardation and microcephaly .",

Both syndromes involve structural or functional loss of expression of genes in the chromosome 15q11-q13 region, including deletions, uniparental disomy, and mutations in an imprinting center. Paternally inherited abnormalities result in PWS while maternally inherited abnormalities result in AS (Knoll et al., 1989; Ledbetter et al., 1981) . PWS is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and feeding problems in infancy followed by excessive and rapid weight gain resulting in severe obesity, cryptoorchidism, short stature, and mild MR. Behavioral characteristics include temper tantrums and ritualistic or obsessive-compulsive behavior (Clarke, Boer, Cheung, Sturney, & Webb, 1996; Dykens, Leckman, & Cassify, 1996; Webb et al., 2002) . The frequency of PWS is approximately 1/15,000 live births. In contrast, AS is characterized by severe MR, microcephaly, hypermotoric behavior with hand-flapping, and jerky movements in association with outbursts of laughter, short attention span, hypopigmented skin and eyes, and seizures with onset under 3 years of age.",

Since shunting of cerebral spinal fluid is now a well-established surgical intervention, only a small proportion of these children has MR.

Because it is a single gene defect and PKU deficiency is identified during newborn screening in all states in the United States, the sequella of MR can be prevented with adherence to a strict diet during infancy and early childhood. The realization that the sequella of PKU can be prevented by strict diet during childhood unfortunately overlooked the fact that the female survivors who then became pregnant needed to go onto the diet perinatally, so the intrauterine environment of the fetus is not toxic with phenyketones (Baumeister & Woodley-Zanthos, 1996; Hanley et al., 1999; Lenke & Levy, 1980; Levy & Ghavami, 1996; Levy & Waisbren, 1983; Rouse et al., 1997; Waisbren, Chang, et al., 1988; Waisbren, Doherty, Bailey, Rohr, & Levy, 1998) . Severe MR and microcephaly are observed in 75-90% of children of mothers with classic PKU (defined as blood phenylalanine level > 1200 mol/l). Less severe cognitive deficit may affect children of mothers with atypical PKU (elevations of blood phenylalanine levels to between 594 and 1194 mol/l, Levy & Ghavami, 1996) . Dietary restrictions during pregnancy to reduce maternal blood phenylalanine levels and prevent phenylalanine metabolite accumulation can improve the outcome in offspring if the diet is started prior to conception and maintained throughout pregnancy.",

A genetic form of hypothyroidism (which, when untreated is referred to as cretinism), unrelated to iodine deficiency, can result in progressive neurological deficits after 3 months of age. In the United States, screening of all newborns is mandatory in all states and thus the occurrence of cretinism is rare. Cretinism can also result when there is maternal, fetal, or neonatal nutritional thyroid hormone deficiency; the supplementation of iodine in the mother needs to occur prior to conception. Cretinism can result in neurodevelopmental deficits in the newborn, including MR and a number of other sensory and motor impairments. When both fetal and maternal hypothyroxinemia are present, such as in iodine-deficient regions of China, it has been shown that iodine replacement in the first trimester of pregnancy was necessary to prevent neurological deficits (Cao et al., 1994; Liu, Momotani, & Yoshimura, 1994; O'Donnell et al., 2002; Wasserstrum & Anania, 1995) . Iodine deficiency can range from mild to severe, and the associated outcomes range from mild cognitive impairments and cerebral palsy to death. Worldwide iodine deficiency is estimated to affect over 20 million people and it has been reported as a leading cause of MR (Hetzel, 1989) .",

The effect of a maternal infection on the fetus may be due to direct actions of toxins or organisms or it can be an indirect consequence of interference with placental or uterine function (Leviton & Gilles, 1996; Leviton & Paneth, 1990) . The effect of a specific infection on fetal development is likely to depend on maternal and fetal factors including genetics, nutrition, stage of development, anatomical site of the infection, and the integrity of the placenta. After implantation interaction between the mother and fetus is mediated through the trophoblast, which has distinct immunological characteristics. In addition, the endometrium of pregnancy is unique and the general maternal response to major histocompatability complex (MHC) antigens in the conceptus is downregulated by maternal antifetal HLA (human leukocyte antigen) antibody production (Johnson, 1995) . Other factors that influence the outcome include the characteristics of the organism, portal of entry, time of exposure, and dose of the infectious organism. One group of intrauterine infections, which has contributed to MR and other adverse consequences, is collectively known by the acronym TORCH: toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes. The impact of these infections is dependent on the time of exposure during gestation.",

In some countries of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific islands prevalence rates are reported above 90%, while in the United States and parts of Europe the prevalence is reported to be around 50%. Transmission occurs through shedding of the virus from nasopharyngeal secretions, urine, saliva, tears, genital secretions, breast milk, and blood. Maternal infections usually occur because of sexual transmission, and high number of sexual partners and early age of intercourse are predictors of occurrence of CMV. Perinatal transmission occurs through exposure of the fetus, in utero, to virus from reactivated or acute maternal disease. The virus can remain dormant in the host and cause latent infection and its sequella are exacerbated if the host has immune compromise. Exposure of the fetus to a primary CMV infection poses a risk of adverse outcome at any stage of pregnancy (Peckham, 1991) . Approximately 10% of infants with asymptomatic infections at birth develop serious sequella, such as optic atrophy, learning disabilities, and MR (Faro & Soper, 2001) . Congenital CMV is reported in 0.2-2.2% of all live births (Baumeister & Woodley-Zanthos, 1996) . The mortality rate among symptomatic newborns is about 30%, and more than 90% of survivors have neurological impairments including microcephaly, seizures, MR, and hearing and vision problems. The pathway of transmission of congenital CMV is probably through the placenta and the critical period of exposure appears to be in the first trimester.",

Transmission of toxoplasma to the fetus occurs only when the mother has been infected for the first time during gestation, except if the mother has severe immune compromise. The outcomes associated with untreated prenatal exposure to the fetus include microcephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and MR (Baumeister & Kupstas, 1991; Remington, McLeod, & Desmonts, 1995; Roizen, Swisher, & Stein, 1995) . Infant sequella of a maternal infection can be prevented if it is detected and treated with spiramycin early in gestation or with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine later in gestation. Although prevalence of congenitally infected infants in the United States is not available it has been estimated that 1-10 per 10,000 infants born annually have toxoplasmosis, and the majority is asymptomatic at birth and does not develop the sequella until later in life Guerina et al., 1994; Lebech et al., 1999) .",

Perinatally acquired HIV infection and pediatric autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) emerged as a cause of MR in the late 1980s (Boylan & Stein, 1991) . AIDS has become a major public health problem in many countries of Africa, where high HIV prevalence among childbearing women is combined with lack of access to antenatal antiretroviral therapy and cesarean delivery, causing vertical transmission of HIV (intrauterine, intrapartum, or neonatal) (European Mode of Delivery Collaboration, 1999). The neurodevelopmental effects of pediatric AIDS include microcephaly and significant delays in cognitive and motor development (Belman, 1992; Macmillan et al., 2001) . These effects have been reported to be greater when transmission of the virus from mother to child occurs in utero versus during parturition (Smith et al., 2000) . In developed countries, improvements in postnatal treatment and survival of children with HIV may be associated with a reduction in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. One U.S. study of HIV infected children aged 3-5 years found no detriment in verbal or performance IQ when compared to controls matched on ethnicity and prenatal drug exposure (Fishkin et al., 2000) . Another study, without controls, of children with AIDS surviving to school age in Philadelphia, found no more than 12% to have developmental scores in the range for MR (Mialky, Vagnoni, & Rutstein, 2001) . Estimates are not available of the prevalence of pediatric HIV-associated neurodevelopmental disorders from low-income countries, where the vast majority of HIV-infected children reside but where few have access to antiretroviral therapy. In addition to direct effects of AIDS on the developing nervous system, the AIDS epidemic may be a causal factor in mild MR to the extent that it increases children's exposure to social, emotional, and economic deprivation during critical periods of development. Cost-effective and accessible methods of prevention and treatment of HIV in developing countries are needed to control this emerging cause of MR. Although administration of antiretroviral therapy and other medications to the pregnant woman can dramatically reduce HIV transmission, this form of treatment and preventive intervention is not widely practiced in the continents of Asia and Africa, due to poverty and political will (Amar, Ho, & Mohan, 1999; Boylan & Stein, 1991) . In low-income countries which include the majority of HIV-infected women worldwide and in which prenatal screening, counseling, and treatment options are limited, the probability of vertical transmission from mother to infant is 30-40%.",

Since the 1970s the proportion of infants born in the United States weighing less than 2500 g has remained around 7% of all births. Premature and low birth weight infants have three times the risk for neurodevelopmental impairments compared to babies weighing more than 2500 g at birth (Teplin, Burchinal, Johnson-Martin, Humphry, & Kraybill, 1991; Whitaker et al., 1996) . It is not clear, in most cases, if intrauterine problems precipitated the premature birth or the early delivery was responsible for the development of subsequent problems. However, it is clear that the relationship between birth weight and risk for developmental delay is inverse, so the greatest risk is at the lowest weight. Risk factors associated with prematurity include young maternal age, minority racial or ethnic status, poverty, and unmarried status, several of which are likely to be concurrent factors. As noted previously, the role of bacteria in premature labor has been an important area of research in the last decade. Bacteria are found in the amniotic cavity in over 10% of patients with PROM, which occurs in approximately 5% of all pregnancies and accounts for 30-40% of all premature deliveries (Baumeister & Woodley-Zanthos, 1996; Cohen, 2000) . However when Romero and colleagues compared randomized antibiotic treatment to placebo, in a multicenter trial, there was no difference between the two groups in postponing birth (Romero, Sibai, et al., 1993) .",

Five categories (A, B, C, D, X) range from the safest, (A) controlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester, and fetal harm appears remote, to (X) studies or experience have shown fetal risk that clearly outweighs any possible benefits. For each presenting problem there are medications that are preferred by most prescribing physicians, based on the FDA categories. Few of the drugs considered unsafe for use during pregnancy that have possible links to MR, include antimicrobials (e.g., sulfonamides, isoniazid, ribavirin), anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine), and warfarin, aminoptein, and accutane. Unfortunately, the inability to detect subtle cognitive limitations in infants results in inconclusive recommendations for many drugs (Jones, 1999; McGuigan & Bailey, 2001) and, more generally, knowledge of potential fetal risk presented by a wide range of medications is incomplete.",

Small amounts of elemental mercury are found in dental amalgams, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, and batteries. In addition, there are natural sources of elemental mercury such as the degassing of the earth's crust, forest fires, the evaporation of seawater, and volcanoes. Mercury also gets into the environment as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels that contain mercury. Inorganic mercury salts are present in some pesticides and disinfectants and in some medications as a preservative. Mercury is constantly cycling through the environment, evaporating into the atmosphere, and returning to the ground and water sources as the result of gravity or precipitation. Both elemental and inorganic mercury can be transformed by microorganisms in water and soil into organic mercury; and the most common organic mercury in the environment is MeHg. Bioaccumulation in the food chain results from MeHg taken up by bacteria and plankton eaten by small fish, subsequently eaten by larger fish, which are caught and eaten by humans and animals. All forms of mercury cross the placenta into the fetal circulation. Maternal exposure usually occurs from the consumption of fish containing MeHg and through inhalation and skin absorption of elemental and inorganic mercury. All forms of mercury can be toxic to the developing brain and the spectrum of effects range from deficits in learning and memory to a cerebral palsy-like syndrome, MR, and microcephaly (McGuigan & Bailey, 2001) . The effects on infants born to mothers with high exposure to MeHg are mainly neurological, including developmental delay and altered muscle tone and tendon reflexes. At low doses, expected in human consumption of fish, there is no population-based evidence of risk (Davidson et al., 1998) . There is human evidence of neural degeneration and glial proliferation occurring throughout the cerebral and cerebellar cortices at high exposure levels, and the clinical manifestations are related to the age of fetal exposure with the effects most pronounced in the second and third trimesters.",

The consumption of fish and shellfish is thought to be a major route of human exposure (Landrigan, 2001) . Some of the earliest evidence of neurodevelopmental deficits produced by PCBs is from an incident in Taiwan where prenatal exposure to PCB-contaminated cooking oil resulted in lower IQs, spatial reasoning deficits, and developmental delays (Longnecker, Rogan, & Lucier, 1997) . However at least one published study (Schell, Budinsky, & Wernke, 2001) refutes the association between PCBs and neurodevelopmental effects in humans. Long-term environmental exposures have been studied in pregnant women eating contaminated fish from Lake Michigan and the results suggest a long-term impact on intellectual function (Buck, 1996; Jacobson, Jacobson, & Humphrey, 1990) . Children with PCB exposures were at greater risk of fetal and postnatal growth deficit and had lower full-scale and verbal IQs in infancy and at age 11 when compared to nonexposed children (Ribas-Fito, Sala, Kogevinas, & Sunyer, 2001) . The latest study (Walkowiak et al., 2001; Winneke, Walkowiak, & Lilienthal, 2002) estimated the prenatal and perinatal PCB exposures of newborns in cord blood and maternal milk and followed the infants until 42 months of age, when PCB concentrations were measured in serum. This study found lower cognitive function in the children with higher levels of PCBs, after controlling for the home environment.",

            "text": "Severe, traumatic brain injury (i.e., with loss of consciousness for longer than 24 h) during childhood can result in long-term cognitive deficits and thus is a preventable cause of MR. In the United States, the leading causes of traumatic brain injury include falls, motor vehicle collisions, sport-related injuries, and assaults (including shaken-baby syndrome and gunshot wounds, Ewing-Cobbs, Prasad, Kramer, & Landry, 1999; Kraus, Fife, Cox, Ramstein, & Conroy, 1986; Thurman, Alverson, Dunn, Guerrero, & Sniezek, 1999) . Despite the relatively high incidence of traumatic brain injuries to children in the population (2-3/1000 per year), evidence from epidemiologic studies indicates that trauma is an infrequent cause of MR (Annegers, Grabow, Kurland, & Laws, 1980; Blomquist, Gustavson, & Holmgren, 1981; Bower, Leonard, & Petterson, 2000; Durkin, Olsen, Barlow, Virella, & Connolly, 1998; Durkin, Schupf, Stein, & Susser, 1998; Gustavson et al., 1977a Gustavson et al., , 1977b Kraus et al., 1986; . One possible explanation for the relatively minor role of trauma in the etiology of MR is that the majority of head injuries severe enough to result in MR is fatal. Another is that nonfatal brain injuries during childhood are followed by considerable recovery of function (Tomlin, Clarke, Robinson, & Roach, 2002) . From a review of the literature, it appears that: (a) long-term sequella of traumatic brain injuries to children commonly include problems with memory, behavior, mood, and sleep, but rarely include significant deficits in general cognition (i.e., intelligence per se) and adaptive behavior (Emanuelson, von Wendt, Lundalv, & Larsson, 1996; Luis & Mittenberg, 2002) ; and (b) most studies of the relationship between trauma and MR focus on MR as a risk factor for trauma rather than trauma as a risk factor for MR (Konarski, Sutton, & Huffman, 1997; Sherrard, Tonge, & Ozanne-Smith., 2002) . The fact that cognitive disability is a risk factor for injury makes it difficult from followup studies of brain-injured children to distinguish cognitive sequella from preexisting cognitive deficits.",

In addition, there can be a confounding effect when children with disabilities and low cognitive function live in family chaos or in families with insufficient support systems. Societal advances that decrease the percentage of children living in poverty or increase the proportion of children attending stimulating child care can reduce deprivation and the exacerbating effect it has on children with established developmental deficits. Efficacious programs targeted at families without adequate resources to provide early stimulation can improve outcomes in these children.

For example, an existing program, WIC-The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, is a potentially effective, existing mechanism to define and reach the population at high risk. Expanding WIC services, already in place and staffed, to provide parent education or referral to high quality child stimulation programs would represent an adjustment of that program rather than the creation of a new bureaucratic service and delivery system. An MR-prevention intervention associated with WIC could reach children early in life, motivate both parent and child involvement, and combine health and education service components.",

The interplay among child and parental medical and social characteristics, poverty, and deprivation must be addressed both in program planning and in research. At the present time, there are established strategies to prevent some environmental and heritable causes of MR, although for religious, social, and ethical reasons they are not always carried out. Identification of causation is fundamental to developing prevention strategies. Prevention of MR challenges the established domains of education, medicine, basic science, and social service to work across discipline and organizational lines.",
