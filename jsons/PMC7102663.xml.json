COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), produces a respiratory and systemic illness which progresses to a severe form of pneumonia in 10-15% of patients [2]. Severe COVID-19 can lead to critical illness, with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and multi-organ failure (MOF) as its primary complications, eventually followed by intravascular coagulopathy [3]. In order to optimize patient care and resource allocation during this pandemic, biomarkers are urgently needed for stratifying patients\u2019 risk and for actively monitoring illness severity.",

Moreover, a low platelet count correlates with higher disease severity scores such as Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II [5]. In the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, thrombocytopenia was reported to occur in up to 55% of patients and was identified as a significant risk factor for mortality [7], [8]. Platelet count, with hypoxemia, were the only two variables used by Zou et al. for developing a SARS prognostic model which displayed 96.2% accuracy [9]. In the present study, we aim to investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease, and assess if thrombocytopenia may be associated with severe COVID-19.",

Subgroup analysis was performed based on study definition of severity. The statistical analysis was performed with MetaXL, software Version 5.3 (EpiGear International Pty Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia).

Eight studies included Chinese patients, whilst one was based in Singapore [18]. The clinical severity was defined as the composite of ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation or death in two studies [11], [13], ICU admission in two studies [12], [16], progression towards ARDS in one study [14], death in three studies [15], [17], [19], and need of mechanical ventilation in the remaining study [18]. All eight studies provided data on the platelet count, whilst only four studies provided information on the rate of thrombocytopenia [11], [12], [14], [19], where thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet count <150\u00d7109/L in two studies [11], [14], whilst was set at <100\u00d7109/L in the other two investigations [12], [19].",

In seven of the studies, patients with severe COVID-19 displayed a lower platelet count compared to those with milder forms (mean difference ranging between -3 to -54\u00d7109/L) [11], [13], [14], [15], [16], [18], [19], whilst in the remaining two studies the platelet count was found to be lower in patients with non-severe forms of COVID-19 (mean difference ranging between 27 to 31\u00d7109/L) [12], [17]. The pooled results of these nine studies revealed that the platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31\u00d7109/L; 95% CI, -35 to -29\u00d7109/L). The heterogeneity was high (I2, 92%; p<0.001). The platelet count remained significantly lower (WMD, -22\u00d7109/L; 95% CI, -26 to -16\u00d7109/L; I2, 91%; p<0.001) in patients with more severe COVID-19 after excluding the large study of Guan et al. [11], which accounted for nearly 71% of the overall sample size. In subgroup analysis of three studies [15], [17], [19] whose primary outcome was mortality, a more substantial drop in platelets was observed in non-survivors (WMD, -48\u00d7109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39\u00d7109/L; I2, 91%; p<0.001). In subgroup analysis of the remaining six studies [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [18] which used a variable clinical definition of COVID-19 severity of which mortality was not the primary outcome, platelets remained significantly low in the severe form (WMD, -29\u00d7109/L; 95% CI, -32 to -26\u00d7109/L; I2, 92%; p<0.001). In the four studies reporting the rate of thrombocytopenia, a platelet count below the lower limit of the locally defined reference range was associated with a over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.13; 95% CI, 1.81-14.58).",

Uniquely to COVID-19, a wide range of variability in disease severity is observed ranging from asymptomatic to critical [2]. As such, biomarkers are needed to identify severe disease among hospitalized patients. In this study, we found that platelet count may be a simple, economic, rapid and commonly available laboratory parameter, that could straightforwardly discriminate between COVID patients with and without severe disease. Moreover, we observed that thrombocytopenia is also associated with threefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19.",

In COVID-19 patients, the mechanism for thrombocytopenia patients is likely multifactorial. In SARS, it was suggested that the combination of viral infection and mechanical ventilation leads to endothelial damage triggering platelet activation, aggregation and thrombosis in the lung, causing vast platelet consumption [7]. Moreover, as lung may be a site of platelet release from fully mature megakaryocytes, a decrease or morphologic alternation in the pulmonary capillary bed may lead to deranged platelet defragmentation [7]. Coronaviruses may also directly infect bone marrow elements resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis, or trigger an auto-immune response against blood cells [7], [21]. It also has been suggested that a consistently present low grade DIC may propagate a low platelet count in SARS [7]. However, as noted by the World Health Organization (WHO), significant differences are observed between SARS and COVID-19 [2]. As such, the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind each infection are likely to differ [21].",
