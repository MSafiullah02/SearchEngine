The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model.

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has dedicated one billion dollars to vaccine development efforts starting with three of these: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Lassa virus and Nipah virus [2] . These three pathogens, as well as others on the WHO's list, such as Zika virus, have high proportions of asymptomatic or mild infection [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES) [8] , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, as infection may contribute to onward transmission, and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome, even without primary symptoms [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, VES is resource-intensive to estimate as it requires testing all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial, or by serologic testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccine-derived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing trial participants is also necessary for estimating a vaccine's efficacy against progression (VEP) to symptoms, another critical outcome measurement [8] . We aim to identify a methodology to accurately estimate VES and VEP when only a limited amount of information is available, and resources -both time and money -are constrained. Throughout, we use \"asymptomatic\" synonymously with \"subclinical\" to mean any infection episode that does not generate sufficient symptoms to prompt testing that would reveal that the participant is currently infected with the causative pathogen.",

The vaccine is leaky, meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon each exposure to an infectious individual. The daily probability of infection from vaccinees' infectious contacts is 1-e -\u03b2(1-VE) , where VE is the assumed direct leaky multiplicative vaccine efficacy [8, 17] . VES is estimated with seven different approaches, which are described in Table 1 . Trial status (i.e. vaccine or control) is the explanatory variable for all Cox proportional hazards models, and individuals who are never infected are censored at the end of the trial. Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day) even for asymptomatic infections and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing is performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and those infected asymptomatically are assumed to have survived without infection to the end of follow up.",

In trials with more communities or increased heterogeneity, the bias from heterogeneity in hazard rates will likely be more pronounced [15] .

This challenge however is not limited to diseases with high proportions of mild or asymptomatic infection, as prior immunity would reduce the power of any trial. Additionally, distinguishing between natural and vaccine-derived immunity can be challenging, especially at the beginning of an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease about which not much is known and for which serologic tests are likely in early stages of development [21, 24] . Therefore, investments in diagnostic development will also be critical for ensuring accurate VE estimates. Finally, many simplifying assumptions are made, including complete ascertainment of infectious cases, perfect sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, and comparability of the infected vaccinees and infected controls for the estimation of VEP [8] .",

This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases and more people in the control group become infected but are still perceived to be at risk. At time t post randomization, person time at-risk in the controls will be overestimated by a factor P(Q)(MNR S T)(MNR U ) relative to the vaccine group, where \u039b(t) is the cumulative hazard to time t, p is the symptomatic proportion in controls, and 1-Y and 1-Z are the efficacy of the vaccine against infection, and disease given infection, respectively [26] .

However, costs and resources can pose major barriers to estimating these critical values. Here we have discussed different methods and their varying levels of accuracy and resource requirements for estimating VES and VEP. The corrected relative risk estimate (Approach 4), the interval censored Cox models (Approaches 5-6), and the imputed interval censored Cox model (Approach 7) provide estimates close to the VES input into the model across values of R0, which is of course also obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of the time of all asymptomatic infections (Approach 1). A Cox model considering only symptomatic infections proves biased, especially at higher values of R0. Approaches 1 and 4-7 also return accurate estimates of VEP, with the exception of Approach 7 when R0 is low due to the small number of cases overall and in the sample. In practice, using a Cox proportional hazards model for the time of all infections would entail testing everyone frequently (perhaps weekly or even daily) for infection throughout the trial, requiring significant expenditures of both money and time. Using a corrected relative risk estimate or an interval censored Cox model, an accurate estimate of VES and VEP can be obtained with serologic testing only once at the end of the trial. Testing only 10% of the trial population and imputing the event status of the remaining asymptomatic trial participants substantially reduces the resources needed while still providing critical information about the vaccine.",
