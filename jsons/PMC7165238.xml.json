Physiotherapy is an established profession throughout the world. Globally, physiotherapists often work in acute hospital wards and ICUs. In particular, cardiorespiratory physiotherapy focuses on the management of acute and chronic respiratory conditions and aims to improve physical recovery following an acute illness. Physiotherapy may be beneficial in the respiratory treatment and physical rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19. Although a productive cough is a less common symptom (34%),4 physiotherapy may be indicated if patients with COVID-19 present with copious airway secretions that they are unable to clear independently. This may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and interventions applied based on clinical indicators. High-risk patients may also benefit, for example: patients with existing comorbidities that may be associated with hypersecretion or ineffective cough (eg, neuromuscular disease, respiratory disease and cystic fibrosis). Physiotherapists who practise in the ICU environment may also provide airway clearance techniques for ventilated patients who show signs of inadequate airway clearance and they can assist in positioning patients with severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19, including the use of prone position to optimise oxygenation.12\n",
