Given the focus on how COVID-19 is impacting work, often missing is discussion on how the pandemic is influencing retirees, and their ability to remain purposeful. This RUNNING HEAD: Purposeful Retirement 2 omission is problematic given that sense of purpose predicts reduced risk for disability among retirement community members (2) , and retired adults may experience greater susceptibility to declining sense of purpose even under normal circumstances (3) . The current pandemic further exacerbates this risk for decline, given the lockdowns at several retirement facilities, limiting family visits and social activities.",

However, retirement communities may infuse community engagement through joint activities between members in their individual living spaces.

As such, retirement communities can ask members to revisit past life challenges and identify how they navigated those obstacles.
