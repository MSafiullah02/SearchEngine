Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0-14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 7-10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0-7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0-18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices). Results Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 \u00b1 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74 \u00b1 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04 \u00b1 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices). Conclusion Pakistani university students and employees have good knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, but unsatisfactory preventive practices. Therefore, health regulators should use multiple communication approaches, such as electronic, print and social media, phone messages, etc., to increase awareness and improve practices related to COVID-19. I use a face mask in the crowds and when I visit healthcare settings nowadays 148 (35.6) 88 (21.2) 104 (25.0) 76 (18.3)",

Previously, six types of coronaviruses were pathogenic to humans, of which four species, namely 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, usually caused common cold-like symptoms, whereas the other two species caused severe respiratory infection, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In late December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus, initially called 2019-nCoV but later named SARS-CoV2, appeared in Wuhan, China [2, 3] . In just a few months, it swept across the world, becoming a global pandemic. The first positive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in Pakistan was reported on 26 February 2020. In order to effectively combat the disease, on 13 March 2020 [Order No. SO(I&C-I) 1-2/2020], the government of the Punjab, a province of Pakistan, closed all educational institutions (schools, colleges and universities) and Deeni Madaris (religious schools). All religious congregations and ceremonies were suspended, marriage/banquet halls were ordered to close, and all public and private sport festivals were cancelled. Moreover, on 23 March 2020 [Order NO. SO(IS-11)1-1/2004], a complete lockdown was imposed in the country. On 27 March 2020, it was estimated there were 13,328 COVID-19 cases (10,018 active cases, 281 deaths and 3029 recoveries) across the country [4] .",

Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices of COVID-19 among Pakistani university students and employees. It was conducted before the universities were closed and an aggressive media campaign was launched by the government to disseminate information related to COVID-19. Therefore, our findings may provide baseline information on awareness of the disease among educated Pakistanis, and highlight misperceptions, myths and malpractices related to it. Our findings are likely to assist the authorities in better planning of awareness campaigns to eradicate misconceptions and malpractices related to COVID-19, which may result in curtailing the disease.",

COVID-19 is neither an air-borne nor water-borne disease; it spreads from infected individuals to others through respiratory droplets while sneezing or coughing, and through contaminated hands. The incubation period has been reported to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4-7) [12] , however the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests it can range from 2 to 14 days [13] . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with one-third of patients experiencing dyspnoea [7, 8] . Other symptoms include myalgia, headache, sore throat, and diarrhoea [8] . Moreover, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases) and healthcare professionals are at greater risk of COVID-19 [8, 14] . In our study, most participants knew the mode of transmission of COVID-19, 55.3% were aware of its incubation period, 93.7% knew the common symptoms, and 72% were aware of high-risk individuals. To date, management of COVID-19 has been largely supportive. Several drugs approved for other indications (e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, sofosbovir, ribavirin, etc.) and some investigational drugs (e.g. remdesivir, favipiravir) are being investigated to prevent or treat COVID-19 [15] . Surprisingly, \u2248 33% and 54% of study participants were unaware that there was no vaccine and any approved cure for COVID-19, respectively. Overall, it was encouraging to see that the majority of university students and employees had good COVID-19 knowledge and attitudes. This might be because our sample comprised staff and students belonging to the medical, pharmacy and allied health sciences fields of education. Similar studies conducted in China, Jordan and Saudi Arabia reported better knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 in university students [16] [17] [18] than were reported in our study in Pakistan.",
