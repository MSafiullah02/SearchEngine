Medical centers must synchronize institutional workforce needs with trainee safety, education, and wellbeing.

Since subspecialty training is time-limited, a few months without procedural experience may have a significant impact on skill development and achievement of graduation and employment milestones. In 1-year procedural subspecialties, a 10-25% reduction in volume could occur in regions where elective procedures decrease for 1 to 3 months. While there is more flexibility in 2-year programs, a restructuring of rotations might be required to redistribute volume to graduating FITs while maintaining younger FITs' exposure. Programs may consider using simulation to bolster FIT readiness, which is also an opportunity to further investigate the effectiveness of simulation in achieving competency in cardiovascular medicine (9).",

Therefore, this kind of medical decision-making may provide important lessons in providing high-quality, high-value, and cost-effective care. Preceptors can deliver feedback on medical history taking and decisionmaking directly to FITs after joint telemedicine visits. This opportunity for targeted skill-based evaluation is one that FITs have likely not enjoyed since medical school or residency.
