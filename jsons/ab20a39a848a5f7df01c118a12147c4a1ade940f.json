Associated annual mortality of 1.3 million children ranges in third position of causes after deaths during the neonatal period and deaths from pneumonia [9] . Of these deaths, 450,000 (approximately one-third) are due to rotavirus (RV)-associated disease, almost two-thirds of them in three sub-Saharan African and three south Asian countries [14] . Besides RVs, other frequent viral causes of AGE in childhood are caliciviruses (of the Norovirus and Sapovirus genera), astroviruses, and enteric adenoviruses (of group F), with enteroviruses, picobirnaviruses, toroviruses and coronaviruses being detected more rarely [4] .",

Relating to RV epidemiology, data are provided by Papp and associates, Ghosh and Kobayashi, and Maneekarn. Similarly, the incidence of infections with astroviruses has been studied in humans and animals in parallel by Krishnan, infections of kobuvirus by Khamrin and of picobirnaviruses by Ganesh and associates. Although the prevalence of noroviruses as cause of human AGE is high [1] , there is still a gap of data from countries under development, especially in Africa. Viruses of avian species (e.g. from turkey) are being studied by Jindal and associates. Although the RT-PCR specific for enteropathogenic RNA viruses has become the diagnostic method of choice, virus isolation in cell culture remains an important tool for strain collections and molecular-biological research projects, and Barman and associated have explored different detection systems for the isolation of RVs in cell culture. Rotavirus pathogenesis has several intriguing features: while the apical epithelia of the small intestinal villi are the primary replication site, the presence of RV antigen, RV dsRNA and sometimes infectious RV in blood point at a systemic component of the infection [2] . The clinical significance of extra-intestinal spread of RV is under intense scrutiny and controversial at present, as reviewed by Alfajaro and Cho. Recently, the detection of the presence of viral genomes by molecular techniques in the absence of virus isolation (metagenomics) has opened a new field of microbial research, exploring the significance of the gut 'virome' for health and various enteric diseases and possibly discovering zoonotically transmitted viruses [10] .
