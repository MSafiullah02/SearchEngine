In these devices, named as \u201cnanomechanical biosensors,\u201d a biomolecular interaction produces a change in the mechanical behavior of the transducer (a movement at nanometer scale), which can be measured and analyzed in real time. Microcantilevers translate the molecular recognition of biomolecules into a nanomechanical motion that is commonly coupled to an optical read-out system. A rectangular beam, clamped at one end, is the most used transducer as it is the simplest mechanical structure that can be easily batch-fabricated at micrometer scale (Kim et al., 2006). Microcantilevers can be fabricated in arrays of ten to thousands, and for that reason, they are a promising alternative to current biochips as they could permit the parallel, fast, and real-time monitoring of thousands of analytes (proteins, pathogens, DNA strands, etc.) without the need for labeling (Baller and Fritz, 2004).",

The cantilever response will depend on its mechanical properties, which are determined mainly by their spring constant and resonance frequency. Both parameters depend on the cantilever material and its geometry. The spring constant, k, and resonance frequency, f\n0, for a rectangular cantilever clamped at one end are given byk=Ewh34L3f0=12\u03c0kmwhere E is the Young's modulus, m is the cantilever effective mass, w is the width, h is the thickness, and L is the length, respectively. Interaction or binding of molecules to one of the cantilever surfaces may lead to a change in the angle of cantilever bending or a shift in its resonance frequency. The detection of these responses is usually referred as static and dynamic modes of operation, respectively. But the mechanical response is also sensitive to different factors, such as temperature, heat, electromagnetic field, stress, and mass. These transducers can be employed for several applications besides biosensing. Figure 10.1\nshows a diagram with both transducer methods and its relation with the properties that could be measured.",

The induced surface stress change could be positive or negative, depending on the surface deformation generated (Shuttleworth, 1950). The cantilever deformation depends mainly on the forces involved in the bioreaction process and is not directly related to the receptor-ligand binding energy. These forces could arise from the bond strength between the receptor and the surface (lineal response) and from the intermolecular interactions between neighboring molecules (non-lineal response). Although the factors and phenomena responsible for this change are still not fully understood, forces coming from electrostatic, steric, and van der Waals interactions, changes in the surface hydrophobicity or conformational changes of the adsorbed molecules could play an important role (Hagan et al., 2002).",

This mass could produce, at the same time, a change in the cantilever spring constant, affecting the final resonance frequency shift (Lu et al., 2005;\nGupta et al., 2006). In this mode, very high sensitivities can be obtained (in the attogram range), superior to those of other similar mass detectors, such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) (Ilic et al., 2004). The microcantilever resonator is also characterized by the quality factor (Q), which quantifies the energy dissipation and is defined as the ratio between the mechanical energy accumulated and dissipated per vibration cycle. The dissipative mechanisms could be both internal and external; the external damping is the dominant factor when working in air or liquids. The quality factor determines the frequency resolution of the system (Lavrik et al., 2004):\u0394f=3f0Q.\n",

The quality factor in liquids could be up to 100-fold lower than in air, reducing the frequency resolution. There are different ways to overcome this limitation: by fabricating cantilevers with higher resonance frequency and quality factors, by measuring the resonance frequency in air under controlled humidity before and after the biochemical recognition, by working with higher order vibration modes, or by using external excitations, among others. For the above reasons, this way of operation is more difficult to implement and most of the cantilever biosensors are based on the static mode.",

In general, they are made of silicon, silicon nitride, polymers, or piezoelectric materials. The microcantilever properties and sensitivity are determined by the cantilever dimensions and material (Young's modulus and Poisson coefficient). The selection of the appropriate characteristics depends on the working detection method (static or dynamic), the final application, and the available fabrication technology. In general, smaller spring constants give softer cantilevers, which are more sensitive to bending. Making thinner and longer cantilevers could improve the sensitivity, but they are also more fragile and therefore more difficult to handle. In addition, the thermomechanical noise increases.",

However, the noise arising from the cantilever thermal motion could limit this ratio value (Alvarez et al., 2006). On the other hand, reducing the cantilever length and thickness results in a sensitivity increase for the dynamic cantilever sensors, reducing the sensitivity for the surface stress sensors. Polymers, such as SU-8, have a lower Young's modulus than silicon and could be more sensitive for static deflection measurements (even if they do not have a high length:thickness ratio); their fabrication process is relatively inexpensive, fast, and reliable.",

Light from the cantilever is injected into the output waveguide, called the \u201creceptor,\u201d separated from the free end of the cantilever by a short gap (see Figure 10.3). Both the cantilever and the receptor are total internal reflection waveguides. If the gap is in the order of several microns, the energy transmitted into the receptor changes dramatically with the displacement of the cantilever's free end. The idea is to monitor the changes in the power transmitted into the output waveguide in order to register the deflection of the cantilever caused by any biomolecular interaction occurring on its surface. The device presented by Zinoviev et al. (2006a) was fabricated using standard silicon technologies. To obtain a straight cantilever free end aligned with the output waveguide, with precision better than 1 \u03bcm, a thermally grown silicon oxide film was used. The input waveguide used for delivering the light into the cantilever should be made out of high temperature low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride because the silica layer cannot work as an optical waveguide on the silicon substrate, due to its lower refractive index. If the input waveguide is fabricated thin enough and utilizes a taper, all the energy can be transmitted into the cantilever, due to the large evanescent field tail of the waveguide mode propagating along the silicon nitride layer.",

The efficiency of biomolecule attachment, the accessibility to its targets, and the degree of non-specific binding have to be taken into account. The immobilization process should avoid any change in the biological properties of the receptors, but, at the same time, must keep the chemical and physical properties of the cantilever as uniform as possible in order to generate a large surface stress. The current interest in nanometer-sized cantilever is demanding new immobilization techniques for the manipulation at nanometer scales; newer strategies from synthetic chemistry will become essential for the manipulation of biosensor surfaces and subsequent assembly of receptors. Controlled chemical functionality can be accomplished using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The strong affinity of sulphur compounds (thiols, thioethers, and disulfides) for gold and other noble metals make them excellent candidates for nanomechanical biosensing (Nuzzo and Allara, 1983; Ferretti et al., 2000), since the cantilever surface usually has one surface coated with a thin layer of gold (20\u2013100 nm) to increase reflectance of the laser beam. The immobilization of both DNA and proteins on gold surfaces using thiol-SAMs has become the most widely employed method.",

            "text": "The covalent immobilization of proteins on the gold surfaces of the cantilevers can be achieved by a wide variety of chemical procedures, ensuring reproducibility and stability of the protein coating (see Figure 10.4\n). The main drawback is that some of the functional groups could randomize the orientation of the active sites of the protein. Thus, the appropriate immobilization procedure must be chosen in order to avoid inactivation or a decrease in the activity of the protein receptor. Several strategies could be employed which have already been useful in many other analytical systems, such as surface plasmon resonance (Boozer et al., 2004), QCM (Mannelli et al., 2005), or electrochemical measurements (Hianik et al., 2001). A very interesting one is to covalently immobilize carboxylate-terminated alkanethiols onto the gold surface, followed by the esterification of the carboxylic groups with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Staros et al., 1986; Grabarek and Gergely, 1990; Patel et al., 1997). Another alternative is using a cystamine modified with glutaraldehyde and the subsequent attachment of the protein through an amine group (Alvarez et al., 2003; Pavlov et al., 2004). In addition, we can immobilize biotinylated proteins on avidin monolayers previously attached to the surface using EDC or cystamine chemistry. The immobilization procedure developed by Park and Kim employs the reaction of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[3-(2-pyridyldithio)pro-pionamido] hexanoate (sulfo-LC-SPDP) with the protein NH2-groups to give amide linkages. The subsequent addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) reduces the disulfide to give a thiol, which finally self assembles onto the gold surface (Park et al., 2002). Alternatively, a protein, such as antibody, protein A, or avidin, can be thiolated, with the thiol group subsequently used for immobilization on the metal surface; however, there is a high risk of denaturing the protein and therefore losing its biological function (Pyun et al., 2005).",

Herne and coworkers demonstrated that a mixed-layer with mercaptohexanol enhanced the hybridization rate and minimized the physical adsorption of DNA probes on gold surfaces by eliminating the weaker adsorptive contacts between the nucleotide chain and gold. In this way, the majority of the immobilized DNA probes are accessible for hybridization with the complementary strand. To prevent non-specific binding to the silicon side of the cantilever, a PEG-silane coating is used (Biswal et al., 2006).",

Frequently used silicon modifications, such as aldehyde activation or coating with poly-lysine or nitrocellulose, are typical for the biomolecule attachment (MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000). The highly reactive epoxysilane surface, for example, reacts not only with amino groups, but also with other nucleophilic moieties on protein surfaces like alcohol, thiol, and acid groups, exhibiting a high binding capacity (Zhu et al., 2001). Other methods employ amine-terminal silanes such as aminopropyl-triethoxysilane to provide a reactive amine group at the nitride surface. Thus, alkylamine coupling using glutaraldehyde is simple and fast, giving an aldehyde derivative that can form an imine linkage with primary amines on the protein (Williams and Blanch, 1994). The direct immobilization via thiol-terminal silanes is also a well-known methodology. Using crosslinkers such as EDC and NHS, it is possible to control the directional immobilization with more than 90% of specific binding to the surface (Shriver-Lake et al., 1997).",

The core of the dispensing head consists of a glass capillary which is surrounded by a tubular piezo actuator. At one end, the capillary forms a nozzle. By applying a voltage pulse, the piezo actuator creates a pressure wave which propagates through the glass into the liquid. This platform has been used for uniform deposition of thiolated DNA and others alkenothiols (Bietsch et al., 2004). The Nanojet technology, also from Microdrop (www.microdrop.com), forms a liquid jet by means of a dispenser system controlled by time and pressure. Provided that the micro valve switches at a very fast rate, volumes down to 200 nl can be dispensed. Moreover, a combination of the Autodrop and Nanojet systems, called \u201cDropjet,\u201d is also available, allowing the generation of a large number of drops with well-defined size (www.microdrop.com).",

At the end of 1960s, some integrated miniaturized devices were developed (Newell, 1968; Newell et al., 1968). However, the idea of fabricating floating structures was given up due to the microelectronics fabrication limitations at that time. As early as 1986, with the appearance of AFM (Binnig et al., 1986) and improvements in microelectronic technology, micro-mechanical transducers started to be used routinely and mass production at low cost was possible. Atomic force microscopy arose as a surface characterization technique, in air and subsequently in liquid, measuring the cantilever deflection induced by the interaction between a tip placed at its free end and the surface of the sample. Expansion of AFM techniques showed the microcantilever sensitivity for measuring intermolecular forces between two complementary biological molecules (Force Spectroscopy), such as the interaction between proteins (avidin/biotin) (Lee et al., 1994), hybridization between complementary single-stranded DNAs (Lee et al., 1994), or antigen-antibody interactions (Dammer et al., 1996).",

Biochemical applications for this type of sensor have been specifically developed for bending-based modes of measurement, with an optical read-out, due to the complexity required for working with the dynamic mode in liquids. The first experiments in solution were focused on ion detection and measurement of changes in surface stress induced by changes in pH or ion concentrations. It was found that the cantilever response depended upon both pH and the ionic strength of the aqueous medium (Butt, 1996).",

(2000a), in which sensitive discrimination of single-base variations in DNA strands was demonstrated without using fluorescent labels. This paper had a wide impact and marked the beginning of a major research effort in this field.

More recently, this technology has been applied for the validation of mRNA biomarkers in total cellular RNA, with sensitivity in the picomolar range without target amplification (Zhang et al., 2006). Another novel application is the design of synthetic DNA motors (Shu et al., 2005), which generate a microcantilever nanoscale motion via controlled conformational changes (see Figure 10.7\n). The forces exerted by the conformational change of precise duplex to non-classical i-motif were shown to induce a compressive surface stress of 32\u00b13 mN/m (which means a single motor force of approximately 11 pN/m). The cantilever direction and amplitude were controlled by buffer pH and the ionic strength, signifying the importance of electrostatic forces in surface stress generation.",

In spite of this limitation, there are some works that demonstrate detection of biomolecules by measuring the cantilever resonance before and after the binding event. Using this methodology, DNA hybridization has been sensed using DNA strands linked to the cantilever by gold-thiol covalent bonding and gold nanoparticle-modified probes. After hybridization, the gold nanoparticles act as a nucleating agent for the growth of silver particles, which leads to a detectable frequency shift by increasing the cantilever effective mass. This method can detect at least 0.05 nM and is able to discriminate a single-base mismatch (Su et al., 2003).",

With this polymer, three-dimensional thin structures with different geometries on each side have been fabricated (Park et al., 2006). In addition to polymer cantilever fabrication, this work demonstrated the mechanical shear stress enhancement of self-organized cardiomyocytes on three-dimensional grooved surfaces compared to that on two-dimensional surfaces (Figure 10.11\n), revealing quantitative mechanical changes in cells in real time between the relaxated state and the contracted state of cardiomyocytes.",

Figure 10.13\nshows the device produced by Zinoviev et al., which contains cantilever transducers with lengths of several hundreds of microns fabricated in an array of 20 (Zinoviev et al., 2006a, 2007). In this work, characterization\nof the cantilevers\u2019 resonance frequency and bending was performed using the optical beam technique for monitoring the waveguide output signal as a function of the cantilever absolute displacement. The sensitivity of both methods, resonant frequency and bending, allows resolution of cantilever displacement to less than 0.1 nm. The effect of covering the cantilevers with gold for biosensing applications has also been studied, showing a strong adsorption depending on the cantilever length and thickness as well as the gold layer thickness. In contrast, the higher order modes are getting filtered, which has the advantage of making the cantilevers single mode in the transverse direction. An additional property of the metallized cantilevers is their ability to deform with light absorption, which helps to adjust the initial position of the cantilever free end with respect to the output waveguide.",

As previously mentioned, one of the main advantages is their ability to detect molecular interactions without any kind of label, reducing the time and cost of sample preparation. Another advantage is the low cost of fabrication and mass production of extremely sensitive devices, as well as the flexibility in fabrication techniques to change the size and shape depending on the required application. Hence, it is possible to fabricate cantilevers with very low spring constants that are very sensitive for bending detection, or reduce its size (stiffer cantilevers) for mass changes measurements. A disadvantage related with the cantilever dimensions is the mechanical\u2013thermal noise, which could limit the fundamental biosensor detection limit.",

This limitation has rendered the static mode as the most attractive method for biosensing platforms. The main disadvantage related to bending detection is the complex relation between the measured signal and the factors producing it, due to the number of forces acting in the biorecognition processes. Although the working principle of mechanical response could be more difficult to understand than in other types of sensors, a new type of information is reported and represents a new alternative for the discrimination of interactions, such as DNA single-base mismatch polymorphisms or single-molecule detection, otherwise not possible with other established biosensing techniques. Among other advantages, microcantilevers present a reduced sensor area, is compatible with the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and can be easily scaled up, being currently fabricated in arrays of tens to thousands of microcantilevers. This could allow the parallel, fast, and real-time monitoring of thousands of analytes (DNA strands, proteins, pathogens, cells, etc.) without the need for labels. Moreover, the bending and resonance response (frequency, amplitude, Q-factor or phase), when simultaneously detected, can supply valuable information.",
