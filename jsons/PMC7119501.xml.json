Seasonal outbreaks of influenza present global health problems involving morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Since 2003, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa posing a pandemic threat of a highly lethal and contagious disease (Gambotto et al., 2008, Webster and Govorkova, 2006). A pandemic caused by swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) infection occurred in 2009 (Dawood et al., 2009, Itoh et al., 2009, Shinde et al., 2009) causing more than 18,849 deaths in more than 214 countries; the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on September 10, 2010, that the pandemic had transitioned into a post-pandemic phase (WHO, 2010a, WHO, 2010b). The occurrence of outbreaks and pandemics indicates that rapid subtyping of influenza viruses, including avian and swine-origin viruses, is a high priority for public health response systems; rapid virus detection is expected to improve the control of the pandemic spread of influenza and patient care.",

This method offers high sensitivity and selectivity, but generally requires approximately 2 h per run; therefore, qRT-PCR is not appropriate for rapid virus detection or subtyping in outbreaks of fast-spreading and/or highly pathogenic viruses at public health centers, hospitals, airports, and other public transportation hubs. Super high-speed qRT-PCR (SHRT-PCR) is a recently developed version of qRT-PCR that is characterized by extremely short reaction times (less than 20 min per run for 40 cycles). In this assay, reaction mixtures of qRT-PCR are applied to thin compact disc (CD)-type sample containers, sealed, and rotated on heat blocks at 3 different temperatures (for denaturing, annealing, and extension temperatures).",

The analysis targeted the nucleotide sequences of the matrix protein segment of influenza virus A (A-MP), influenza virus B (B-MP), and hemagglutinin (HA) of the 2009 pandemic S-OIV and H5N1 avian influenza viruses. Using this system, 86 strains of influenza viruses isolated from hospitals in Tokyo and the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health were rapidly analyzed and subtyped. The typing results were correlated with those using a standardized qRT-PCR method. SHRT-PCR is expected to provide new strategies for controlling the transmission of influenza viruses.",

A/Duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/07 (H5N1), a low pathogenic H5N1 subtype vaccine strain, was generated by genetic reassortment between 2 low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses, A/Duck/Hokkaido/101/04 (H5N3) and A/Duck/Hokkaido/262/04 (H6N1) (Soda et al., 2008).

A cutoff value of 10 copies was decided upon to avoid unpredicted nonspecific peaks from being misidentified as a positive signal.
