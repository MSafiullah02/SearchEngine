            "text": "Disruption of local airway defense mechanisms often increases vulnerability to pneumonia among cancer patients. Breach of the respiratory epithelial barrier function and altered mucociliary clearance of secretions may occur as a result of cancer therapy, both through cell-specific injury and through generalized mucositis. Medical devices, such as nasogastric and endotracheal tubes, hinder coordinated glottic activities and mucociliary function and act as conduits for chronic colonization of pathogenic organisms [5]. Numerous defects of local innate defenses are also described following chemotherapy, including derangements of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing by alveolar macrophages and resident mast cells. Respiratory epithelial cells tend to maintain their capacity for elaboration of inflammatory mediators following exposure to pathogens, despite cytotoxic chemotherapy [6, 7]. Yet, they are the primary interface with lower respiratory tract pathogens and are often susceptible to direct injury by MDR pathogens, due to the unique exposures of the cancer patients, as described further below. Further, concurrent alterations in systemic defense mechanisms, such as impairment of the circulating leukocytes of the innate immune system, are exceedingly common.",

In addition, neutrophil dysfunction resulting from radiation therapy, corticosteroid administration and common cancer-related disorders, such as hypovolemia, prolonged hypoxemia, acidosis, and poorly controlled hyperglycemia, is a frequent problem. Severe neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of \u2264500 cells/\u03bcL, is associated with refractory lung infections caused by bacterial and fungal organisms [9]. In addition, the rapidity of onset of neutropenia and delay in neutrophil recovery play a role in the infection severity. More than 10% of patients with febrile neutropenia present with pulmonary infiltrates and infection remains the most frequent cause of radiographic abnormalities in these patients. The absence of consolidated infiltrates on chest radiographs does not exclude an evolving occult pneumonia, particularly in the setting of profound neutropenia (<100 cells/\u03bcL).",

Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Entero\u00adbacter, Citrobacter, Serretia) and Proteus spp., [10] are the predominant source of pneumonias associated with neutropenic fever. MDR Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are also frequently cultured in the setting of neutropenic pneumonia. The incidence of pulmonary infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, Streptococcus spp., including Streptococcus pneumoniae) has decreased over the past three decades, while Gram-negative pneumonias, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas spp., have become an increasing source of life-threatening, necrotizing lung infection (Fig. 12.1) [11]. Other nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria (NF-GNB) such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [12\u201315], Achromobacter, and Alcaligenes species have also increased in the recent years and often lead to difficult-to-treat infections [14, 16]. As is the case in almost all other populations, aspiration of infected material remains the predominant mechanism of entry for lower respiratory tract infection among cancer patients. However, hematogenous dissemination represents a uniquely common source of pneumonia among cancer patients, and bacteremia in febrile neutropenic patients may not present with an obvious primary site of origin. Initial antimicrobial therapy for febrile neutropenia in patients with pulmonary infiltrates should be broad in spectrum and provide antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant strains of S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Early deescalation therapy may be attempted in patients who have demonstrated prompt clinical response and in whom granulocyte recovery has occurred or is expected to occur in the near future, especially if a pathogen has been identified. Deescalation should be undertaken with caution in high-risk patients with poor clinical response to antimicrobial therapy; persistent, severe, and/or long-standing granulocytopenia; or patients continuing on systemic immunosuppressive therapy.\n",

For example, immunoglobulin dyscrasias associated with hypogammaglobulinemia and defects in opsonization owing to asplenia are frequent among patients with certain types of lymphoreticular malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenstom\u2019s macroglobulinemia. Hypocomplementemia associated with asplenia may lead to unchecked proliferation of encapsulated organisms that require opsonization with complement (C3, C5) for elimination. Furthermore, defects in antibody-dependent lymphocyte cytolytic activity may allow fulminant parasitic infections. Reduced T cell numbers and activity is a frequent finding among patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease, hairy cell leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In addition, viral illnesses, antineoplastic agents, and other immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., fludarabine, IL-2 inhibitors, antithymocyte globulins, calcinneurin inhibitors, tacrolimus, or glucocorticosteroids) may depress cellular immunity by inducing profound lymphopenia and/or interrupting activated T-cell inflammatory signal transduction pathways. Patients with cellular immune dysfunction are at increased risk of infection due to intracellular organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Legionella spp., Pneumocystis jiroveci, and Toxoplasma gondii, invasive pulmonary mycoses, and opportunistic viruses due to human cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), and varicella-zoster virus. Thus, virtually every component of normal host immunity may be affected in an untoward manner by cancer or its treatment. The severe and oftentimes protracted immune suppression that follows encourages the development of unusual and intractable infections. Specific pathogens causing pneumonia that are commonly associated with depression of particular immune defects are listed in Table 12.1.",

The distinction of CAP from nosocomial pneumonia remains important, as it allows prediction of likely pathogens and permits prognostic estimations based on epidemiologic descriptions of the underlying cause. Consequently, this distinction provides a framework for decisions regarding the diagnostic evaluation and empiric antimicrobial therapy. Cancer patients are frequently exposed to the healthcare setting, both as inpatients and outpatients.

Superinfection with MDR organisms is an emerging problem that complicates the management of CAP. S. aureus, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas spp., and other GNB may also cause life-threatening CAP. Recently, other NF-GNB such as Stenotrophomonas, Burkholderia, Chryseobacterium, Achromobacter, and Alcaligenes species have been increasingly recognized as etiologic agents in both CAP and nosocomial infections [16, 17]. S. pyogenes,\nNeisseria meningitidis, and Moraxella catarrhalis also cause CAP less frequently. The incidence of CAP associated with the atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. varies widely with patient age and geographic location. Viral pneumonias, most commonly influenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviral infections, are sources of CAP, which may cause severe pneumonias in the cancer setting.",

Early and accurate diagnoses are critical to a successful outcome, although treatment should not be withheld while diagnostic interventions are undertaken. Antimicrobial selections are best based on knowledge of the infecting pathogen, if available, pneumonia severity, underlying immune status, and the presence of comorbid conditions [18, 19].",

Lung infections that occur more than 48 h after hospital admission in patients without antecedent clinical symptoms or radiographic findings suggestive of pneumonia are referred to as HAP. HAP is a common complication in patients receiving treatment for cancer. Recently, the ATS and IDSA recognized HCAP as a distinct entity within the spectrum of HAP and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [20]. HCAP includes patients hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the current infection, patients treated in a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within 30 days of the pneumonia diagnosis, nursing home, or long-term care facility residents, and recipients of intravenous antibiotics, chemotherapy, or wound care within 30 days of the current infection. HAP, HCAP, and VAP comprise the majority of pneumonias in the cancer setting. The spectrum of pathogens in HCAP closely resembles late-onset HAP and VAP, particularly among elderly patients [21]. Thus, guidelines for the management of HCAP generally overlap with HAP and VAP. In the nonimmunosuppressed solid-organ cancer patient, HAP is most often seen in the intensive care units (ICUs). In fact, admission to the ICU increases the risk of pneumonia in these patients by nearly 20-fold. As many as 80% of ICU-related HAPs occur among patients receiving ventilatory support and the effect of VAP in ICU length of stay, ventilator days, and hospital length of stay is well documented [22].",

Aspiration of orogastric contents and mechanical obstruction of the airways may create a favorable milieu for pneumonia caused by microaerophilic or anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Peptostreptococcus spp.). A variety of factors, such as abnormal swallow function, altered cough reflex, impaired mucociliary clearance, altered mental status, use of sedating medications, chemotherapy-induced mucositis, supine positioning, gastroparesis, mechanical ventilation, and nasogastric tube feeding all contribute to the increased predilection for aspiration in the cancer setting. Pneumonia associated with large-volume aspiration of gastric contents typically occurs as a late finding. The acidic gastric contents act as a poor medium for bacterial growth. Thus, the initial clinical syndrome following aspiration of gastric contents arises from the direct caustic effect of the acidic aspirate on the cells of the alveolar-capillary interface (i.e., chemical pneumonitis). Pneumonia due to superimposed bacterial infection, if it occurs, presents as a later finding. ARDS, respiratory failure, and death may rapidly follow. Aspiration of oral contents, by contrast, results from inhalation of nonsterile oropharyngeal material. The clinical presentation is often insidious and the diagnosis is commonly inferred based on a compatible patient risk profile coupled with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Chest radiographs may show areas of geographic abnormalities that correlate with the patient\u2019s position at the time of aspiration. For example, aspiration that occurs while the patient is in the upright position typically localizes to the basilar segments of the lower lobes, whereas the superior segments of the lower lobes and posterior segments of the upper lobes are more frequently affected following aspiration that occurs in the supine position. The major pathogens underlying nosocomial versus community-acquired aspiration pneumonias differ, and in a substantial portion of patients, a microbiologic diagnosis may not be established due to the limited yield of conventional anaerobic cultures. If necessary, such cultures may be best obtained bronchoscopically using a protected specimen brush or other protected strategy.",

This is often most rapidly achieved through interventional bronchoscopic techniques such as tumor debulking by laser, electrocautery, or argon plasma coagulation with or without stent placement. Endobronchial brachytherapy or cryotherapy can be applied bronchoscopically as well, often with excellent results, but the time to effect is generally longer than with the formed strategies.

Nocardia asteroides complex, including N. asteroids sensu stricto and N. farcinica, accounts for nearly 90% of Nocardia infections, both in cancer patients and the general population. Risk factors for Nocardia pneumonia include profound deficiencies of cellular immunity, prolonged use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, especially in the treatment of chronic lung diseases, [24] and the presence of GVHD. Although the latter two risk factors are often seen together (i.e., steroid treatment for GVHD), each appears to independently increase risk. Nodular pulmonary infiltrates are common radiographic findings, although reticulonodular or diffuse infiltrates are occasionally described. Solitary nodules associated with irregular, thick-walled cavities that mimic invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, necrotizing cancer, or chronic bacterial lung abscess have also been reported (Figs. 12.2 and 12.3). Indolent Nocardia pneumonia is clinically indistinguishable from other actinomycetes infections and from pneumonias caused by pulmonary eumycetes infections. Severely immunosuppressed cancer patients with refractory leukemia or allogenenic hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may present with pulmonary nocardiosis, a rapidly progressive, often multifocal form of Norcardia. Spontaneous pneumo\u00adthorax and hemoptysis are widely reported presentations among immunocompromised patients (Fig. 12.3). Conco\u00admitant brain involvement is common, and preemptive evaluation is recommended to diagnose asymptomatic brain abscess in the setting of pulmonary disease. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (10\u201312 mg/kg daily) is effective against many Nocardia spp. Retrospective studies suggest improved outcomes when appropriate therapy is given for an extended period of time (6\u201312 months) [25]. Yet, despite antimicrobial therapy, pulmonary nocardiosis carries a high mortality in high-risk cancer patients [24]. Pulmonary actinomycosis typically presents in a very similar manner to nocardiasis, though sulfur granules are described more typically in samples from the former and infections classically cross tissue plans; pulmonary infection oftentimes involves the adjoining pleura and may erode through the chest wall. However, isolation of Actinomycetes from the respiratory tract should be evaluated critically, as in most patients their presence represents oropharyngeal contamination.\n\n",

Most pulmonary tuberculous infections in oncology centers in the United States are caused by reactivation of a remotely acquired latent infection. Pulmonary tuberculous may present as an insidious pneumonia that is difficult to distinguish from actinomycetes and eumycetes infection. Patients with impaired T-cell response may develop rapidly progressive tuberculous that follows a virulent bacterial infection. Systemic corticosteroid therapy is an independent predictor both of tuberculous reactivation and of a suboptimal response to combination antimicrobial therapy. Hence, once the diagnosis of tuberculous is established, every effort should be made to discontinue steroid therapy [26]. Just as observed in HIV-infected patients who initiate therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy and demonstrate clinical worsening of their tuberculous pneumonia (i.e., immune reconstitution syndrome), tuberculous-related lung disease in cancer or stem cell transplant patients may infrequently worsen as patients\u2019 immune functions recover.

In the United States, the rapidly growing mycobacteria (\u00adparticularly M. abscessus and less frequently M. fortuitum, M. smegmatis, and M. goodii) have emerged as less frequent causes of NTM infections. The diagnosis of pulmonary NTM remains a challenge as identification of these mycobacteria in respiratory culture samples may result from colonization of the respiratory tract or environmental contamination. Causality is suggested by identification of NTM in sterile lower respiratory tract samples coupled with nonspecific clinical features, such as chronic nonproductive cough and exertional dyspnea. The cough may occasionally become productive, indicating underlying bronchiectasis. Fever, night sweats, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and pleural effusions are seldom seen. Radiographic features include upper lobe predominant nonspecific nodular lesions and small, thin-walled cavities. Chest CT findings demonstrating the characteristic \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d appearance may also be seen in patients with chronic infection. The so-called Lady Windermere syndrome, characterized by relapsing or refractory pulmonary NTM due to slow-growing mycobacteria, may be seen in patients with defects in endogenous interferon-gamma activity [27]. NTM pulmonary infections are usually insidious, although rapidly progressive disease has been seen in patients with profound defects in helper T-cells.

M. kansasii is antigenically similar to M. tuberculous and causes lung disease that is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from pulmonary tuberculous. Endemic areas for M. kansasii infections in the US include the urban Southeast and Midwestern States. Due to associated architectural derangements and possibly because of impaired phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, pneumoconioses are well-established predisposing conditions for NTM infection. Prolonged therapy (12\u201324 months) with rifampin plus one or two other susceptible antimicrobials is recommended.",

Pulmonary Varicella-zoster virus and HHV-6 lung infections are difficult to distinguish from CMV pneumonitis. Seasonal respiratory viruses (RSV, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza type 3, and Adenovirus) also cause serious lower respiratory tract infections in immunosuppressed cancer patients. Fever and nonproductive cough are prominent nonspecific features. In patients with extensive lung involvement, dyspnea may appear early in the course of infection. Viral antigen detection in nasal washes, tracheal aspirates, and bronchial specimens is most frequently used in determining active viral replication. Chest CT scans may show ground glass infiltrates, despite normal conventional chest radiographs. A normal chest CT scan in high-risk HSCT recipients with suspected viral pneumonitis excludes the possibility of infection in >95% of cases. The presence of CMV viremia is another helpful indicator in determining the etiology of a pulmonary process. The isolation of CMV antigen from lower respiratory tract secretions may not, however, necessarily indicate pulmonary infection, as patients with cellular immune defects may have intermittent low-level viral replication and shed virus without developing end-organ disease. Ganciclovir or foscarnet are commonly prescribed for systemic CMV and HHV-6 infections. Antiviral combinations with adjuvant immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy are associated with variable results and presently not recommended for routine use. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been recently recognized as a serious pulmonary pathogen. The spectrum of hMPV disease may range from mild upper respiratory tract infection to serious disseminated infection leading to respiratory failure and encephalitis. Ribavirin has been used successfully and intravenous ribavirin may be considered for patients with life-threatening hMPV disease [40].",
