[11, 19, 24] However, all these laboratory markers are very non-specific, making their clinical utility limited. When evaluating suspected cases, physicians cannot rely on these laboratory abnormalities to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. These abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with SARS and MERS. [57] [58] [59] Previous research suggests these abnormalities may be related to the cytokine storm brought on by infection. [22] Recently, a study suggested that COVID-19 may primarily affect T lymphocytes, especially CD4+ T cells, resulting in significant lymphopenia as well as decreased IFN-\u03b3 production. [60] Additionally, by using a multiple linear regression model, a study showed that CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (p=0\u00b7010).",

This novel virus is genetically similar to bat coronaviruses, and shares about 79% and 50% of its genetic sequence with the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), respectively.[4] Although epidemiological evidence suggests most of the initial patients were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the animal source of COVID-19 has not yet been identified.[1] Human-to-human transmission is now responsible for most new infections, including those among family members and health care workers.[5-7] Pneumonia caused by 2019-nCOV, known as COVID-19, is of huge global concern, with confirmed cases in 34 Chinese provinces and nearly 30 countries across five continents. The WHO's International Health Regulations Emergency Committee declared this outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.[2] As of 2 March 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in China has reached 80302 and 2947, respectively. Outside of China, a total of 10449 cases have been confirmed, including 170 deaths.[8] Only one published systematic review and meta-analysis summarized clinical characteristics of COVID-19.[9] It reported a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 4.3%",

Articles published on or before March 2, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: \"coronavirus\" or \"nCoV\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" or \"COVID-19\". References of all retrieved studies were screened for additional eligible publications. Primary studies were eligible if they reported any information on COVID-19 patients in China without restriction on study type or study design. We excluded studies that focused on infection in infants, did not report original data or clear diagnostic criteria, and no reliable clinical data as well as research outside mainland China. Two independent reviewers (LF and BW) screened the literature search and assessed each study for inclusion. Any disagreement was solved by consulting a senior investigator (HZ). Four authors (TY, XC, BW, and LF) independently extracted relevant information, including first author, publication time, study designs, city, number of COVID-19 patients, mean or median age of patients, maximum follow-up duration (days), history of exposure in Wuhan, smoking history, diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, presence of medical comorbidities, clinical symptoms, radiologic findings, laboratory findings, complications, supportive treatment, and clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. We also extracted the original author's guidelines for defining severe case and screened them according to Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment Of COVID-19 (Sixth Edition) from the NHC.[8] We classified patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) as severe cases when authors did not report diagnostic criteria for disease severity. Studies that only reported data for critically ill patients were excluded in the overall meta-analysis but were included in the meta-analysis restricted to severe cases.",

This is consistent with a singlecenter retrospective study found that older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS were at increased risk of death.[45] A multivariate Cox regression analysis results showed age and severe cases were identified as independent prognostic factors for virus clearance.[62] Furthermore, a study showed that children might be less likely to become infected or, if infected, may show milder symptoms.[16] Another study also confirmed that the elderly and those with comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, liver diseases, malignancy were more likely to develop critical illness (62.1%\uff1a25.0%\uff0cp<0.001).[62]",
