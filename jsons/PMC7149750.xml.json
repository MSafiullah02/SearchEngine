An emerging pathogen may be defined as an infectious agent whose frequency or geographic range increases following its first introduction into a new host population, while a reemerging pathogen is one whose incidence or geographic distribution is increasing in an existing host population as a result of long-term changes in its underlying epidemiology. The emergence of pathogens may be based on subjective criteria, which may reflect increasing awareness, improved diagnosis, discovery of previously unrecognized infectious agents as well as any objective epidemiological data (Woolhouse, 2002, Engering et al., 2013).",

Like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp160, influenza hemagglutinin, and Ebola virus glycoprotein, the CoV spike (S) glycoprotein protein is a class I viral fusion protein that mediates virus binding and fusion, allowing virus to enter the host cell (Xu et al., 2004). Like other class I fusion proteins, the S-glycoprotein contains two functional domains, S1 and S2, linked by a protease cleavage site (Xu et al., 2004). The S1 domain (17\u2013756aa) contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (318\u2013510aa) while the S2 region (757\u20131225aa) contains the two heptad repeat (HR) regions that facilitate viral fusion and a transmembrane domain (1189\u20131227aa) which anchors the tip on the viral envelope (Xu et al., 2004). CoVs are thought to accumulate in cells by the following sequence of events: cell-receptor binding ACE2, DPP4, and APN to affect tropism in the cell by endocytosis and cleavage of SARS-CoV S by cathepsin-cell protease. L causes a rearrangement of S1 and S2 subunits inducing fusion of the viral membrane and the host to deposit the viral/nucleocapsid genome complex in the cytoplasm where replication occurs.",

SZ16 was isolated from palm tree crops in live animal markets in the Guangdong region of China during the outbreak, and its protein S differs from the epidemic strain, SARS Urbani, in 18 amino acids, 16 of which are in the S1 domain containing the RBD. The crystalline structure of ACE2-receptor-bound SARS-CoV RBD and biochemical experimentation demonstrated that the critical amino acids (K479, T487) in the SZ16 S civet RBD inhibited its binding to the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2), thereby providing a block in the expansion of host range and human pathogenesis (Sheahan and Baric, 2010).
