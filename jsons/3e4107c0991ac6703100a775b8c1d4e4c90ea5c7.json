Poor and remarkably unreliable data sit uncomfortably with scientific precision and technological complexity. It is well known of course that the International Oil Companies (IOCs) -Exxon in particular (Mulvey et al 2015; Hall 2015) -have long been in the business of selling doubt and providing what can only be described as fake news; but governments in oil-states are also implicated. In this sense, the world of oil and gas is a textbook case of the agnotology discussed by Proctor (Proctor 1995) . The reams of data and statistics produced on the oil and gas sector actually present a highly distorted picture of what we do and do not know about the industry's operations (Power 1994; Barry 2015; Zalik 2015) . Sketchy or inconsistent information has been the touchstone of course for the transparency and disclosure movements, particularly around revenue flows and capture.",

            "text": "According to the NOSDRA oil spill monitor website, the national picture of oil spills (2006 ( -March 2020 is a total of 13,091 spill events and a total release of 692,761 barrels. Of these events, 71.5.% of the incidents pertained to crude oil accounting for 95.7% of total spill contaminants. The spatial distribution of spill events and spill volumes vary sharply across states (Rivers State alone accounts for just under 30% of all spill incidents -followed by Bayelsa and Delta -and 32.3% of the total quantity spilled). About Yet publicly available data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation contrasts markedly with this statistical picture. Data on pipeline malfunction ('vandalizations' and 'ruptures') is provided by NNPC in its Annual Statistical Bulletin but these are aggregate figures for the whole of the country (though the vast majority occur in the Niger delta) 4 . NNPC pipeline loss data (for the five regions of the country) documents over 35,000 incidents since 2005 which amount to a quantity of oil lost almost 40 times larger than the total spill volume for the Niger delta on its oil monitoring site! Of these 488 are due to \"equipment failure\" (roughly 1.3%). The volume of 'petroleum products' lost over that period was 4,737,046 metric tons (33.7 million barrels) 5 . Data on 'crude oil losses' -only available for a five-year (2013-2018) -amounted to 4,946,150 barrels, a figure more than 7 times higher than that reported by NOSDRA for 2006 to the present (641,239). Similarly a study comparing monthly oil spill data from NOSDRA with annual data from NNPC discovered -to take one example among many -a discrepancy in the year 2006 of between 300 and 3000 in the number of annual spills (Yeeles and Akporiaye, 2016) . million barrels of oil\" of which more than 70% was not recovered (UNDP 2006, p76) .Two-thirds of these spills (69%) occurred off-shore, a figure which seems implausible.",

Subsequently a 'risk based assessment' (Form B) is to be submitted by the oil company whose facilities are affected within two weeks of a spill; this includes clarifying information on the cause, method of containment, weather conditions at time of observation and some further details on the spill extent and impacts as well as a proposed clean-up.

There a is strong incentive for the operating firm to attribute cause to sabotage rather than operational failure. The same applies to the Nigerian state and given the joint venture arrangement through which the NNPC is majority shareholder. The participation of representatives of state regulatory institutions present at these investigations is financed by the operating firm. Operators may withhold per diems or offer kickbacks each of which influence the real and perceived objectivity of these representatives. There are also significant financial and structural factors likely to produce under-estimates of spill volumes. Among these, the volume of the spill drives estimates for compensation, yet companies -with a clear conflict of interest in the results-essentially control the estimates. The 2013 Amnesty report notes various irregularities in presented data. These include major discrepancies between publicly posted SPDC data and the data indicating spills attributed to SPDC on the NOSDRA website, and the data reported by Shell's Nigerian subsidiary SPDC versus Royal Dutch Shell internationally in the period 2007-2012. As we discussed above, a review of the information posted by Shell and NOSDRA since 2013 reveals that this discrepancy has continued. SPDCs data indicates a lower number of spills to those reported by NOSDRA. However, despite the lower number, SPDCs data includes spills that are not searchable in the NOSDRA database.",

An Accufacts survey revealed serious problems in the technical basis of spill assessment: for instance, teams assess surface area based on rough measurements. They reviewed various photos from JIVs which had been deemed sabotage in the JIV process, yet which Accufacts re-assessed as the result of corrosion or welding failure. In particular, the use of both 1) ultrasonic readings (UT) and 2) the use of the 'o'clock' position to ascertain sabotage as cause are appraised as inaccurate and unscientific, Accufacts explains:",

Surface area approaches might be adequate for small rate (small hole/ opening or crack releases of a short duration) affecting a small area, but will most likely significantly underestimate oil released for larger opening/ much higher rate, longer duration releases, especially pipeline ruptures over a widely dispersed area. Accufacts' experience would indicate that, especially for large oil spills, such as those associated with pipeline ruptures, the surface area approach can seriously underestimate the volume of oil spilled. Surface area approaches can particularly miscalculate spilled quantity if local environments can permit the rapid migration of oil in land (hills) or water (such as moving water)\" (cited in Amnesty 2013, p. 29). between one and three barrels of oil were leaking per minute -this amounted to between 1,440 and 4,320 barrels of oil flooding the Bodo area each day\" (Amnesty 2013, p. 29, fn 43).",

Yet as Nwadishi and Nnimmo Bassey point out in this issue, environmental data is a clear gap in the material generated via formal Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative audits, even in Nigeria where civil society pressure has led to significant disclosures through the EITI. Of course in its original design EITI was not intended to be a tool for the exploration and determination of the costs of operations on the ground on the oilfields (Van Alstine 2017; Haufler 2010). As growing numbers and volumes of oil spills have been attributed to sabotage, however, upon which basis the oil industry withholds compensation, the question of pollution is increasingly central to the issues of financial transparency and revenue allocation in the Niger Delta. Decades of pollution and its impact on local agrarian production, arguably, have created the conditions in which tapping of pipelines is one of the few sources of reliable income available to many local youth which complicates the question of 'cause' even in the case of clear sabotage. Understanding and quantifying historical and ongoing pollution is thus central to assessing livelihood options available to Niger Deltan residents.",

Research on the Canadian context, including by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has revealed inconsistent and misleading spill reporting (Pereira 2013 , Winter 2014 , Kheraj, 2014 , Gilbert and Zalik 2019 . There is no single definition of a pipeline 'spill incident' under Canadian law, which leads to confused regulation and reporting across crown land -under both provincial and federal jurisdiction.",

Nevertheless, consistent and reliable data on oil spill quantity would allow for a financial estimate of the net present value of surface pollution caused by decades of oil spills; this would likely emphasize the massive compensation owed to residents of the Niger Delta. As we complete this article in the context of the Covid 19 pandemic, the mutual constitution of socio-ecological deterioration and world trade flows has perhaps never been more evident. Refashioning the broader political economy in the aftermath of this global lockdown demands we produce a more complete understanding of transnational extraction and exchange, and design systems that internalize and account for the socioecological damage arising from global industry, commodity production and provisioning.",
