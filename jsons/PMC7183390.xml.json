At admission, he was asymptomatic, and during hospitalization, he progressively developed fever (up to 38 \u00b0C) and hypoxemia. Temporal track of clinical data, laboratory tests and imaging findings (both computed tomography (CT) and [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT), retrospectively retrieved, are reported in the Figure. Imaging suggested viral infection. Diagnosis was obtained by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on rhino pharyngeal swab. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to a Covid-19 dedicated hospital; surgery was postponed. We could not reach the patient for consent; local ethics committee approved the publication.",

Neoplastic disease may constitute a risk factor and also a confounding factor. It is important to recognize Covid-19 as early as possible for optimal patient management and ensure hospital staff and patient\u2019s safety. Imaging demonstrated Covid-19 even in the presence of mild symptoms. In view of its high sensitivity, imaging may be considered for anticipating diagnosis and safety interventions. Early after image acquisition, scans should be reviewed to identify suspected Covid-19 cases. High-resolution CT of the thorax during PET acquisition could improve lung abnormalities detection.",
