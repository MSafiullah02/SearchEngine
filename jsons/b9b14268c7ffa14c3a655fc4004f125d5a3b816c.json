Multiple immune defects may coexist among patients with cancer, which adds to the conundrum and spectrum of opportunistic infections. Immune defects, including compromised acellular and cellular (alveolar macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils) innate and/or altered adaptive immune function, leading to either inadequate immmunoglobulin or defective T-cell mediate defenses may promote the development of specific types of pneumonia. In addition, treatment-induced disruption of the respiratory mucosa and ciliary dysfunction may result in inadequate clearance of airway secretions, enhancing the likelihood of pneumonia. Hence, the individual patient's predilection for pneumonia in the cancer setting is best understood by examining the effect of malignancy and its treatment on specific host immune defenses (Table 12 .1). Because the immune defect is often mixed, careful attention to clinical and radiographic features and recognition of nosocomial versus community-acquired sources of the infection are critical to making the diagnosis and guiding empiric antimicrobial therapy [4] . Delays in appropriate antimicrobial therapy increase the risk of secondary complications and infectionassociated deaths, especially in severely immunosuppressed individuals. Therefore, it is common practice to initiate empiric and/or preemptive antimicrobial therapy in patients in whom the suspicion of infection is high. An approach to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer-related pneumonias based on the specific defects in the major arms of host immunity and broad categories of infection source is emphasized in the early part of this section, followed by a more detailed discussion of selected pathogens that may cause fulminant infection in the cancer patient.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1229, "end": 1232, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 956, "end": 965, "text": "(Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Disruption of local airway defense mechanisms often increases vulnerability to pneumonia among cancer patients.

Numerous defects of local innate defenses are also described following chemotherapy, including derangements of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing by alveolar macrophages and resident mast cells. Respiratory epithelial cells tend to maintain their capacity for elaboration of inflammatory mediators following exposure to pathogens, despite cytotoxic chemotherapy [6, 7] . Yet, they are the primary interface with lower respiratory tract pathogens and are often susceptible to direct injury by MDR pathogens, due to the unique exposures of the cancer patients, as described further below.

Severe neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of \u00a3500 cells/mL, is associated with refractory lung infections caused by bacterial and fungal organisms [9] . In addition, the rapidity of onset of neutropenia and delay in neutrophil recovery play a role in the infection severity. More than 10% of patients with febrile neutropenia present with pulmonary infiltrates and infection remains the most frequent cause of radiographic abnormalities in these patients.

Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serretia) and Proteus spp., [10] are the predominant source of pneumonias associated with neutropenic fever. MDR Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are also frequently cultured in the setting of neutropenic pneumonia. The incidence of pulmonary infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, Streptococcus spp., including Streptococcus pneumoniae) has decreased over the past three decades, while Gram-negative pneumonias, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas spp., have become an increasing source of life-threatening, necrotizing lung infection ( Fig. 12.1 ) [11] . Other nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria (NF-GNB) such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [12] [13] [14] [15] , Achromobacter, and Alcaligenes species have also increased in the recent years and often lead to difficultto-treat infections [14, 16] . As is the case in almost all other populations, aspiration of infected material remains the predominant mechanism of entry for lower respiratory tract infection among cancer patients. However, hematogenous dissemination represents a uniquely common source of pneumonia among cancer patients, and bacteremia in febrile neutropenic patients may not present with an obvious primary site of origin. Initial antimicrobial therapy for febrile neutropenia in patients with pulmonary infiltrates should be broad in spectrum and provide antimicrobial activity against drugresistant strains of S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Early deescalation therapy may be attempted in patients who have demonstrated prompt clinical response and in whom granulocyte recovery has occurred or is expected to occur in the near future, especially if a pathogen has been identified. Deescalation should be undertaken with caution in high-risk patients with poor clinical response to antimicrobial therapy; In addition to neutropenia, cytotoxic antineoplastic therapies and hematologic malignancies may cause severe depression of humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immunity, resulting in inadequate immunoglobulin production and/or a variety of defective T and B cell-mediated defects. For example, immunoglobulin dyscrasias associated with hypogammaglobulinemia and defects in opsonization owing to asplenia are frequent among patients with certain types of lymphoreticular malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenstom's macroglobulinemia. Hypocomplementemia associated with asplenia may lead to unchecked proliferation of encapsulated organisms that require opsonization with complement (C 3 , C 5 ) for elimination. Furthermore, defects in antibody-dependent lymphocyte cytolytic activity may allow fulminant parasitic infections. Reduced T cell numbers and activity is a frequent finding among patients with Hodgkin's disease, hairy cell leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, and graftversus-host disease (GVHD). In addition, viral illnesses, antineoplastic agents, and other immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., fludarabine, IL-2 inhibitors, antithymocyte globulins, calcinneurin inhibitors, tacrolimus, or glucocorticosteroids) may depress cellular immunity by inducing profound lymphopenia and/or interrupting activated T-cell inflammatory signal transduction pathways. Patients with cellular immune dysfunction are at increased risk of infection due to intracellular organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Legionella spp., Pneumocystis jiroveci, and Toxoplasma gondii, invasive pulmonary mycoses, and opportunistic viruses due to human cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), and varicella-zoster virus. Thus, virtually every component of normal host immunity may be affected in an untoward manner by cancer or its treatment. The severe and oftentimes protracted immune suppression that follows encourages the development of unusual and intractable infections.

The distinction of CAP from nosocomial pneumonia remains important, as it allows prediction of likely pathogens and permits prognostic estimations based on epidemiologic descriptions of the underlying cause. Consequently, this distinction provides a framework for decisions regarding the diagnostic evaluation and empiric antimicrobial therapy.

HCAP includes patients hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the current infection, patients treated in a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within 30 days of the pneumonia diagnosis, nursing home, or long-term care facility residents, and recipients of intravenous antibiotics, chemotherapy, or wound care within 30 days of the current infection. HAP, HCAP, and VAP comprise the majority of pneumonias in the cancer setting. The spectrum of pathogens in HCAP closely resembles late-onset HAP and VAP, particularly among elderly patients [21] . Thus, guidelines for the management of HCAP generally overlap with HAP and VAP. In the nonimmunosuppressed solid-organ cancer patient, HAP is most often seen in the intensive care units (ICUs).

A variety of factors, such as abnormal swallow function, altered cough reflex, impaired mucociliary clearance, altered mental status, use of sedating medications, chemotherapy-induced mucositis, supine positioning, gastroparesis, mechanical ventilation, and nasogastric tube feeding all contribute to the increased predilection for aspiration in the cancer setting. Pneumonia associated with large-volume aspiration of gastric contents typically occurs as a late finding. The acidic gastric contents act as a poor medium for bacterial growth. Thus, the initial clinical syndrome following aspiration of gastric contents arises from the direct caustic effect of the acidic aspirate on the cells of the alveolar-capillary interface (i.e., chemical pneumonitis). Pneumonia due to superimposed bacterial infection, if it occurs, presents as a later finding. ARDS, respiratory failure, and death may rapidly follow. Aspiration of oral contents, by contrast, results from inhalation of nonsterile oropharyngeal material. The clinical presentation is often insidious and the diagnosis is commonly inferred based on a compatible patient risk profile coupled with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Chest radiographs may show areas of geographic abnormalities that correlate with the patient's position at the time of aspiration. For example, aspiration that occurs while the patient is in the upright position typically localizes to the basilar segments of the lower lobes, whereas the superior segments of the lower lobes and posterior segments of the upper lobes are more frequently affected following aspiration that occurs in the supine position. The major pathogens underlying nosocomial versus community-acquired aspiration pneumonias differ, and in a substantial portion of patients, a microbiologic diagnosis may not be established due to the limited yield of conventional anaerobic cultures.

Although the latter two risk factors are often seen together (i.e., steroid treatment for GVHD), each appears to independently increase risk. Nodular pulmonary infiltrates are common radiographic findings, although reticulonodular or diffuse infiltrates are occasionally described.

Aspergillus fumigatus is most prominent in this group, although amphotericin B-resistant A. terreus has recently emerged as the second most frequent Aspergillus spp. in cancer patients [31] . The near-exponential rise in pulmonary invasive fungal infections due to non-Aspergillus molds such as Fusarium, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Scedosporium spp. and the dematiaceous (black) molds that are often not susceptible to conventional antifungal agents poses a serious challenge in the selection of effective empiric and preemptive therapy.

Hemoptysis is not uncommon chest imaging studies are frequently nonspecific, though CT scans may reveal a highly suggestive \"halo sign\" or \"crescent sign.\" In most cases of pulmonary mycosis, the only radiographic findings at the time of presentation are peripheral, pleural-based lung nodules, sometimes with thick-walled regular or irregular cavities (Fig. 12.4) [32] .

This has largely been attributed to effective prophylaxis with fluconazole in immunosuppressed cancer patients. The incidence of Zygomycosis, on the other hand, has increased in recent years. This is likely related to the increased utilization of the recently available antifungal agent, voriconazole, with a concomitant decline in the use of amphotericin B. Zygomycetes organisms typically show a high level of susceptibility to amphotericin B. With the decreased utilization of this agent, rates of fungal infections at our institution caused by zygomycosis, invasive aspergillosis, and Fusarium species during the years 2002-2004 were 0.095/1,000, 0.302/1,000, and 0.073/1,000 patientdays, respectively [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nontuberculous Mycobacteriosis (NTM)."}, {"text": "The definitive diagnosis of pulmonary invasive fungal infection requires demonstration of fungal hyphae within the involved lung tissue. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis is often made by inference, as thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies often render biopsies unsafe. It is important to note that the isolation of molds in patients from peripheral or central venous blood samples may not indicate disseminated mycosis, even in severely immunosuppressed allogeneic HSCT recipients [34] . Similarly, isolation of fungi in respiratory samples may misrepresent the etiology of underlying pulmonary infiltrates. Therefore, the current consensus for invasive fungal infections diagnosis includes: (a) evaluation of host's predisposing factors such as prolonged granulocytopenia, high-risk HSCT, GVHD, immunosuppressive therapy; (b) clinical features (less often seen in cancer and stem cell transplant recipients); (c) radiographic features; and (d) isolation of pathogenic fungus from sterile respiratory sites. The measurement of fungal antigens such as serum galactomannan levels may be helpful in the detection of pulmonary mycosis. In a recent study of HSCT recipients, serum galactomannan levels were diagnostic in >85% of patients. The diagnostic utility of this test, however, was markedly compromised in the setting of antifungal therapy [35] . Newer diagnostic tests, including fungal DNA amplification in sterile samples, are currently under investigation and need clinical validation before routine use is recommended. The treatment of pulmonary mycosis has improved considerably in the past ~10 years. The availability of voriconazole as primary therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [36] and caspofungin for salvage therapy of refractory invasive aspergillosis [37] is a promising addition to the antifungal armamentarium. Antifungal combinations may be prescribed for high-risk cancer patients and HSCT recipients with invasive mycosis. Due to the lack of prospective randomized trials, there is no consensus in recommending preferred antifungal combinations. A preliminary study using various antifungal combinations hinted modest superiority of caspofungin plus voriconazole in HSCT recipients with invasive fungal infections [38] . Reconstitution of the immune system, including recovery of severe granulocytopenia, remains the critical determinant in promoting resolution invasive fungal infections. Donor granulocyte transfusions and adjuvant recombinant T H 1 cytokines need prospective evaluation, although the results of preliminary observational studies among high-risk allogeneic HSCT recipients with disseminated mycosis appear promising [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 480, "end": 484, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1345, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1702, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1780, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2248, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2665, "end": 2669, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nontuberculous Mycobacteriosis (NTM)."}, {"text": "Viruses. Human cytomegalovirus pneumonia is the most frequent cause of opportunistic viral complications in cancer patients with defective cellular immunity. Pulmonary Varicella-zoster virus and HHV-6 lung infections are difficult to distinguish from CMV pneumonitis. Seasonal respiratory viruses (RSV, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza type 3, and Adenovirus) also cause serious lower respiratory tract infections in immunosuppressed cancer patients. Fever and nonproductive cough are prominent nonspecific features. In patients with extensive lung involvement, dyspnea may appear early in the course of infection. Viral antigen detection in nasal washes, tracheal aspirates, and bronchial specimens is most frequently used in determining active viral replication. Chest CT scans may show ground glass infiltrates, despite normal conventional chest radiographs. A normal chest CT scan in high-risk HSCT recipients with suspected viral pneumonitis excludes the possibility of infection in >95% of cases. The presence of CMV viremia is another helpful indicator in determining the etiology of a pulmonary process. The isolation of CMV antigen from lower respiratory tract secretions may not, however, necessarily indicate pulmonary infection, as patients with cellular immune defects may have intermittent low-level viral replication and shed virus without developing end-organ disease. Ganciclovir or foscarnet are commonly prescribed for systemic CMV and HHV-6 infections. Antiviral combinations with adjuvant immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy are associated with variable results and presently not recommended for routine use. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been recently recognized as a serious pulmonary pathogen. The spectrum of hMPV disease may range from mild upper respiratory tract infection to serious disseminated infection leading to respiratory failure and encephalitis.
