HSV most commonly leads to orofacial, genital, and esophageal lesions, and less commonly can lead to hepatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, bone marrow suppression, and pneumonia [22, 38, 42]. HSV pneumonia is very rare and has been reported in about 3% of the patients with hematologic malignancies and in about 5% of patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (these patients will be referred to as \u2018HSCT patients\u2019 in the chapter) without prophylaxis [56]. After acyclovir prophylaxis was implemented in patients with a HSCT, the incidence of HSV excretion dropped to 2.5% [49], while HSV pneumonia has been reported in less than 1% of all pneumonias developing after HSCT [16].",

Several triggers, such as stress, corticosteroid administration, and immunosuppression, may cause reactivation of the virus [22]. HSV affects squamous epithelial cells, and factors promoting squamous metaplasia such as smoking, trauma, burns, and tracheal trauma from intubation may predispose a patient to develop HSV pneumonia [27, 51, 52, 56, 60]. Intubation of a patient with oral herpes can trigger reactivation or cause a lower respiratory tract infection through direct inoculation or aspiration [8, 56]. Thus, intubated patients who fail to be weaned off the ventilator should be evaluated for HSV pneumonia, as it is an often under-recognized cause of nonbacterial pneumonia [46].",
