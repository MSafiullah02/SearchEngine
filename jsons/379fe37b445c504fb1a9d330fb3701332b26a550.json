            "text": "Objectives. To investigate whether cyclophilin A (CypA) can up-regulate the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocytes/macrophages and whether CD147 facilitates this regulation in RA. Methods. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from RA patients and differentiated into macrophages by M-CSF (15 ng/ml). Under CypA stimulation (200 ng/ml), the protein release and activation of MMPs were detected by gelatin zymography and invasion assay. Human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were selected for the advanced searching for potential interaction between CypA and CD147 in production of MMPs and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Results. CypA significantly increased production and activation of MMP-9, not MMP-2, in the monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SF. CSA and HAb18G/CD147 antagonistic peptide AP-9 against CD147, respectively, dramatically decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, both in the absence or presence of CypA. Similar effects of CypA on MMP-9 production and cell invasion were observed in THP-1 cells. CypA-induced nuclear factor B (NF-B) activity for MMP-9 transcription were strongly blocked by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors (U0126 and SP600125, respectively), but not by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (SB203580). CypA also induced calcium mobilization and increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to ECM. Conclusions. These findings suggest that in RA, the abundant CypA, by its direct binding to CD147, up-regulates MMP-9 expression and adhesion of monocytes/macrophages to ECM, and the cyclophilin-CD147 interactions might contribute to the destruction of cartilage and bone.",

After the addition of CypA, Ca 2\u00fe mobilization in the uTHP-1 and dTHP-1 cells was increased (Fig. 8a) . Anti-CD147 antibody HAb18 strongly decreased cytosolic Ca 2\u00fe concentration and CypA had no effect on Ca 2\u00fe concentration after HAb18 treatment. When CypA was pre-incubated with CSA or cells were pre-incubated with HAb18, no cytosolic Ca 2\u00fe mobilization response was observed. In the absence of exogeneous cyclophilins, the adhesion of uTHP-1 and dTHP-1 to ECM-coated plates was $25.5 and 31.2% of initially added cells, respectively (Fig. 8b) . A significant increase in both the uTHP-1 and dTHP-1 cell adhesion was observed with CypA treatment (P < 0.05). In contrast, CSA or anti-CD147 antibody HAb18 dramatically reduced THP-1 cell adhesion, both in the absence or presence of CypA. These results confirmed that CypA enhanced Ca 2\u00fe mobilization and cell adhesion via direct binding to CD147 on THP-1 cells.",

We found that CypA significantly up-regulated MMP-9 expression in monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SFs and M-CSF-differentiated macrophages, while it had less effect on monocytes. This difference suggested that, as one of inflammatory factors, the marked effect of CypA on the MMP-9 production in monocytes/macrophages might need monocytes' differentiation and maturation. The highest productions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocytes/macrophages from RA SF showed high activities of inflammation. Another phenomenon, that MMP-9 production and invasive ability of monocytes/ macrophages from RA patients were higher than those from normal humans, suggested that the inflammation activity of monocytes/macrophages in RA patients might be higher than those cells in normal humans.

CD147 expression correlates well with MMP expression levels and cell invasive ability in some cancers, such as hepatoma and prostatic carcinoma [19] , and the aggressive characteristics of RA synovium are similar to those of neoplastic tissues [31] . In our previous studies, CD147 expression on RA fibroblast (FLS) was found to be higher than that on OA FLS and its expression on monocytes/ macrophages derived from RA SF was higher than that derived from normal human peripheral blood. High CD147 expression on monocytes/macrophages significantly up-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 production of RA FLS by interaction with CD147 itself [19] , which formed the homologous or heterogenetic dimer to promote MMP expressions. Soluble CD147 was also found to have enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production of RA FLS by its binding to membrane CD147 (data not shown). In this study, the results showed that CD147 expression increased when monocytes and uTHP-1 were differentiated into macrophages, and both of siRNA and AP-9 against CD147 decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in monocytes/macrophages. The reasons for this downregulation might be that siRNA down-regulated the quantity of membrane CD147, which in turn reduced CD147 dimers, FIG. 3. Invasion assay of monocytes/macrophages with CypA stimulation. Monocytes and macrophages from normal human (a) and RA patients' (b) peripheral blood were pre-treated, respectively with CSA, or AP-9, and then were stimulated by CypA for invasion assay.

These results suggested that CSA might downregulate MMPs by decreasing CD147 expression, and CypA might up-regulate MMPs by direct binding to membrane CD147 on monocytes/macrophages and not by increasing CD147 expression. The results of no additional decrease or increase of MMP-9 production when cells were treated with the combination of RNAi and CSA under CypA stimulation suggested that RNAi and CSA targeted the same pathway in CypA-induced MMP-9 production. The increasing CD147 expression on macrophages might be one of the reasons for the difference of CypA's effect on MMP-9 between monocytes and macrophages, which means that the receptor of CypA on cells was increased for enhancing transduction signalling.",

The statistical data showed relative enzyme activity of pro-MMP-9 (b), MMP-9 (c) and pro-MMP-2 (d) with different treatments. CypA increased total MMP-9, but not MMP-2, secretion in the uTHP-1 and dTHP-1 cells.
