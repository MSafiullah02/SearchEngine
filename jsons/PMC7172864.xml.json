Viral nucleic acid test by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the first line screening method of choice [3]. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR is insufficient, ranging from 50 to 62% according to previous large-scale reports [4,5]. Some patients may be highly suspicious, based on established close contact with confirmed cases, typical clinical manifestations and CT image appearance, but may still develop a false negative initial RT-PCR, which increases the risk of community transmission and delay in treatment. Nonetheless, RT-PCR remains the gold standard tool for confirming COVID-19 infection, incorporating multiple RT-PCR tests to make up for its shortcomings.",

Recent studies showed CT of COVID had typical appearance of viral lung infection, with a sensitivity of 60\u201398% [8,9]. Notably, CT changes may be identified before patients become symptomatic and RT-PCR positive [[10], [11], [12]]. In Hubei, there was a temporary period where diagnoses of COVID-19 were based on CT changes even without positive PT-PCR result to ensure timely treatment and isolation measures. On the contrary, no CT abnormality was found in part of the confirmed cases when pneumonia was absent. Other kinds of viral pneumonia can also mimic COVID-19 pneumonia, which makes it difficult to differentiate. Few studies include non COVID-19 patients as control in the analysis. Moreover, most of the study results are from Wuhan or Hubei patients, which may potentially cause over estimation by enrolling more severe cases. Thus, the diagnostic performance of CT in COVID-19 is less clarified.",

Two experienced general radiologists (LJX and LZD, 17 and 14 years of experience), who had specific training of COVID-19 presentation on chest CT by online courses and real-life cases, independently reviewed the images to determine whether CT findings were positive. Image readers were aware of the patients\u2019 epidemiological history and clinical characteristic, but blind to personal information and RT-PCR results, which is the same as clinical setting.

The reported sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 is 50\u201362%, which is acceptable but still comes with a moderate proportion of missed diagnoses. Our study shows that initial RT-PCR yield a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%, which is a little bit higher than previous reports. The RT-PCR testing accuracy may be affected by a number of factors including viral load in the respiratory tract, specimens source, sampling procedures and timing, quality control of the test, and inherent performance of the testing kits [16]. Therefore, the RT-PCR is unlikely to be a reliable and independent tool for COVID-19 screening. Furthermore, in the case of coronavirus pandemic, PCR testing kits are in limited supply in many countries, even in developed countries, and there may not be enough staff to sample and process the test.",

Chest CT have played an important role in early detection, evaluation, and treatment response monitoring of COVID-19 infection. However, chest CT manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia overlaps with other types of viral pneumonia, bringing potential impact on its specificity [18]. Although it is just three months from initial outbreak of the disease, our result showed that experienced radiologists with special training in the diagnosis of COVID-19 had excellent diagnostic accuracy of 88%, and good interobserver agreement. No statistical difference was found between chest CT and initial RT-PCR in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. This result is similar with the study of Harrison X. Bai et al. [19], which demonstrated that the accuracy of three Chinese radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia was 83%, 80% and 60%. Our study is significant by demonstrating that radiologists in low prevalence area are also capable of diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical setting with high specificity but moderate sensitivity, even when patients without pneumonia were enrolled.",

A large group study of Wuhan patients reported a sensitivity of 97% for chest CT, with 308/601 patients showing typical CT manifestations before RT-PCR test was positive [21]. In our study, the sensitivity of chest CT was 77%, which was close to the earliest large group study by W. Guan et al. [21] (86.2%, 840/975 CT scans). They also reported that more normal CT cases were found in non-severe than severe patients. Unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to cause mild respiratory symptoms, fewer severe cases, but more contagious [22]. Pneumonia may be absence in mild patient, resulting in normal chest CT [23]. Thus, a possible explanation for the lower sensitivity in chest CT is that patients in our study were far from the epidemic center, consequently, more mild patients without pneumonia were admitted in our hospital. In the 8 cases of false negative CT in our study, 6 were completely normal, one presented with a very small patchy subpleural GGO, and a case only presented with bronchiectasis. Patients with normal chest CT contributed most of the decrease in sensitivity. A multi-center study by Yang, W. et al. [24] also found that most of the cases outside Wuhan were mild, 17/149 cases had normal CT on admission.",

Our result demonstrated that the combined strategy of initial RT-PCR following with CT yield a remarkably improved sensitivity from 79% to 94%. The top priority of transmission control is to screen any clinically suspected case to identify and quarantine the infected patients, provide timely treatment and find out all close contacts for further examination. Disease control authorities may pursue measures with higher sensitivities while sacrificing a bit of specificity. Given the extremely high sensitivity of CT in the epidemic center and relatively low sensitivity of RT-PCR, it was once argued that CT should had equal importance with RT-PCR for confirming COVID-19 in Hubei province, which was later temporarily adopted in the 5th trial edition of the national guideline of diagnosis and treatment. In fact, initial RT-PCR and chest CT are both provided in the Guangdong province of China when symptomatic patients are first admitted. The comprehensive screening strategy has been working effectively in China since the beginning of outbreak.",

Future study may include artificial intelligence for images reading to avoid subjective bias and improve diagnostic performance. Noteworthy, most of the COVID-19 patients in the study had mild to moderate presentation in chest CT, making it easier for radiologist to make differentiate diagnosis, and consequently skew the specificity. Lastly, most of the RT-PCR kits currently in use were developed in short period and may not be adequately tested prior to application in the context of urgent needs. Better reference standard needs to be set up for comparing diagnostic method of COVID-19.",
