This process is also involved in protein misfolding and aggregation.",

            "text": "In comparison with conventional protein\u2013protein interactions,4 domain swapping has two distinct kinetic features. First, the interconversion between the monomer and the domain-swapped dimer is generally very slow.5\u20137 The equilibrium process may take days or even months. Second, the interconversion rate is very sensitive to temperature.5, 6, 8, 9 An increase in temperature by 3\u22124\u00b0C is sufficient to produce an overall increase of the conversion rate by 10-fold.8, 9 The extracted enthalpy component of the activation barrier is larger than 100 kcal/mol. These behaviors are closely related to the folding/unfolding process of proteins. In an extreme model (the unfolding mechanism for domain swapping),6, 8, 10 it was proposed that domain swapping proceeds via complete unfolding, so the swapping kinetics can be explained in terms of the equilibrium folding/unfolding properties of proteins. Very recently, a study on Cyanovirin-N indeed verified that the energy barrier of domain swapping is very close to the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the protein.8 However, there were also some doubts on the feasibility of the unfolding mechanism of domain swapping.9, 11 The main concern is that the population of the fully unfolded state is too low to account for the observed swapping rate.9, 11 In addition, careful examination with rigorous formalism is necessary to distinguish domain-swapping via fully unfolded states from domain-swapping via partially unfolded states. For example, the rigorous derivation of the unfolding mechanism for domain swapping predicts that the enthalpy barrier of domain swapping is two times that of the equilibrium unfolding enthalpy of the protein monomer (will be given below), and not onefold as that defined previously.8",

A main reason for this suggestion is that k calculated from Eq. (6) greatly exceeds the typical protein association rate constants.9 However, after considering the influence of \u0394Cp, we found that the conclusion may change. From Kang et al.9 we have Tm = 59.1\u00b0C and \u0394Hu (Tm) = 430 kJ/mol for the Mpro-C monomer. (\u0394Hu(Tm) was estimated from the data of \u0394Gu (25\u00b0C) = 44.1 kJ/mol from Kang et al.9 by assuming they did not considered the influence of \u0394Cp. A direct refitting to Figure 2(F) of Kang et al.9 results in a similar value of \u0394Hu(Tm).) We are not aware of any experimental results describing the \u0394Cp of Mpro-C, so we estimated this value from the general scaling law of \u0394Cp with respect to the chain length,14 which predicts that \u0394Cp = \u2212251 + 0.19 (\u0394ASA) = \u2212251 + 0.19 \u00d7 (\u2212907 + 93N) (in a unit of cal/(mol\u00b7K)) where \u0394ASA is the change in solvent-accessible surface area upon unfolding and N is the length of the protein. For Mpro-C (N = 120), it is estimated that \u0394Cp = 7.1 kJ/(mol\u00b7K). With these parameters, we re-evaluated the folding/unfolding thermodynamics at the swapping temperature (\u223c37\u00b0C) to be: \u0394H = 270 kJ/mol and \u0394G = 23.3 kJ/mol. Thus, 2\u0394H = 540 kJ/mol and this value is comparable to the swapping \u0394H\u2021 (374/436 kJ/mol).9 Based on and the kon value (11.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u22121 s\u22121) at 37\u00b0C from Kang et al.,9k is determined from Eq. (6) to be 7.7 \u00d7 105 M\u22121 s\u22121, which is a typical protein association rate limited by diffusion.4 Consequently, the doubt on the feasibility of the unfolding mechanism may be dismissed.",

In the unfolding mechanism we discussed, U*U is assumed to be made of two completely unfolded monomers. If swapping proceeds via partial unfolding, then U*U should be composed of partially unfolded monomers and the derived swapping kinetics would relate to the thermodynamics of partial unfolding. Thus, there does not exist a tight correlation between the swapping kinetics and the global protein stability for swapping proceeds via partial unfolding.",

            "text": "Thioredoxin (Trx) plays an essential role in many biological processes, including cellular redox balance, promotion of cell growth, and inhibition of apoptosis.20 Garcia-Pino et al. showed that a single active-site mutation on the oxidized form (Trx_W28Aox) converts the protein into a biologically inactive domain-swapped dimer.21 The swapped dimer of Trx_W28Aox is a kinetically trapped species. Its unfolding is not reversible, i.e., it spontaneously refolds to the monomer after thermal unfolding. (In Garcia-Pino et al.,21 the transition was written as S2\u21922I, which is synonymous to our notation of D\u21922M here. For the unfolding of monomer, the van't Hoff enthalpy instead of the calorimetric enthalpy was assigned to \u0394H since van't Hoff enthalpy better reflects the properties of denatured population.) In other words, the Kd is very large in this system and the measured swapping kinetics is mainly determined by koff. Based on Table III of Garcia-Pino et al.,21 we have calculated that \u0394H = \u0394HD \u2192 2M + 2\u0394H = 14.4 + 2 \u00d7 47.1 = 109 kcal/mol. (The swapping kinetics was extracted from the temperature dependence of the apparent excess heat capacity in Garcia-Pino et al.,21 so the swapping temperature was close to the melting temperature and we need not consider \u0394Cp in the calculation). This \u0394H value is very similar to the measured swapping kinetic barrier \u0394H\u2021 (120 kcal/mol),21 suggesting the unfolding mechanism to be responsible for the domain swapping of Trx_W28Aox.",

However, criteria should be developed to rigorously test any proposed mechanism. In this article, we established the formalism of the (fully) unfolding mechanism for domain swapping and used the obtained criteria to analyze the properties of three representative proteins. We are not suggesting that the unfolding mechanism is universal for all swapped proteins since each protein may behave in a distinct manner; however, the criteria presented were met in the examined proteins. Therefore, the unfolding mechanism probably dominates in these example systems.",
