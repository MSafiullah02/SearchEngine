Among coronavirus members are those responsible for the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS), and the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of the disease COVID-19). 1 Coronaviruses primarily cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans. 2 Discovered in the 1960s, they were originally thought to be only responsible for mild disease, with strains such as HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 responsible for the common cold. 3 That changed in 2003 with the SARS pandemic and in 2012 with the outbreak of MERS, both zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates greater than 10% and 35%, respectively. 4 Both coronaviruses likely emerged from native bat populations, which maintain a broad diversity of coronaviruses, and were transmitted through an intermediate host to humans. Loss of natural habitat and increased exposure to new hosts are likely responsible for the increased frequency of zoonotic infections originating from bats. 5, 6 Evidence also supports that the novel coronavirus which emerged in the Wuhan region of China in late 2019 also originated from bats. 7 This novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in an outbreak of pathogenic viral pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in December 2019. Subsequent spread has led to a global pandemic (officially declared by the WHO on March 11, 2020 8 ) .",

            "text": "COVID-19 disease appears to be a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure. Common symptomology at the onset of illness are fever, cough, and general myalgia, with less common symptoms including sputum production, headache, and diarrhea. 9\u221211 An initial case analysis from China through mid-February 2020 found 14% of cases were associated with severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency \u2265 30/min, blood oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24\u221248 h), and 5% of cases were critical (i.e., respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure). 12 A more extensive meta-analysis found a slightly higher severe disease percentage (20.3%). 13 The disease case fatality rate (CFR) varies depending on region, population demographics, and heath care capabilities; for instance, in Italy an overall CFR of 7.2% is estimated, in part driven by the higher proportion of individuals of advanced age compared to China. 14 On the basis of global data, the CFR from COVID-19 based on confirmed cases is estimated to be \u223c6.9%. 15 Disease progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome typically occurs in older patients (over 63), often with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension or diabetes; 16 elevated risk of mortality was associated with advanced age, sepsis, blood clotting deficiencies. 17, 18 In individuals less than 60 years of age, an increased body to mass index (over 30) was associated with increased disease severity and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 19 Other symptoms, including neurologic symptoms and coagulopathies, have also been reported in a portion of infected individuals. 20\u221224 Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, with a cell tropism of nasal epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages in the lung and enterocytes in the bowel. 25\u221227 Although not limited to only these specific cell types, evidence does support that cell binding via the viral S protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for infection ( Figure 1 ). 28, 29 Following entry of the virus into the host cell, the virus complex is then translocated to the endosome, where endosomal acid proteases cleave the S protein mediating membrane fusion. 28 The viral genome is released and translated into the viral replicase polyproteins PP1a and PP1ab, which are cleaved into functional proteins by viral proteases. Subgenomic templates for mRNA synthesis and translation of the viral structural proteins occur through discontinuous transcription. 2 Viral genome replication is mediated by the viral replication complex, which includes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, exonu-cleaseN, and other accessory proteins. Subsequent assembly of viral nucleocapsids from the packaged viral genomes and translated viral structural proteins occurs at the endoplasmic Figure 1 . Life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract (nasal epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages) and the gastrointestinal tract (enterocytes). The virus enters though direct interaction between the viral S protein and the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Following entry, the viral genome is released and translated into the viral replicase polyproteins PP1a and PP1ab, which are cleaved into functional proteins by viral proteases. 2 Viral genome replication is mediated by the viral replication complex, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Viral nucleocapsids are assembled from the packaged viral genomes and translated viral structural proteins and released through exocytosis. Potential targets and postulated mechanism of action for antiviral interventions are shown: blocking virus/host cell interaction through the use of antibodies/nanobodies (and convalescent plasma therapy) or recombinant ACE2 protein; use of hydroxychloroquine (based on in vitro data) to inhibit endosome maturation; use of protease inhibitors to inhibit viral/endosome membrane fusion or viral polypeptide maturation; nucleoside/nucleotide analogues to inhibit viral genome replication. reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, 30 with infectious virions then released from the cell through exocytosis.",

The consequence is that drug repositioning and repurposing has received a significant amount of attention, 31 and approved agents including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ritonavir, ruxolitinib, and camostat have entered clinical trials to address the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Figure 1 ). 32\u221234 Although some candidates do have pre-existing data to support activity against coronaviruses, other repurposing candidates for potential use against SARS-CoV-2 are based on their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro. 29,35\u221237 These include hydroxychloroquine, a known autophagy inhibitor that suppresses lysosomal function, 38 and the serine protease inhibitor camostat. 29 The ability of these compounds to act as prophylactic agents, treat disease, or even modulate viral replication in vivo has not been demonstrated, although clinical evaluation of several of these potential therapeutics is ongoing.",

Nucleosides are poorly cell-permeable (and therefore can have a low hit rate in cell-based screens such as antiviral screens), so modified nucleosides such as monophosphate, ester, and phosphoramidate prodrugs composed a significant portion of the library. Such prodrugs are typically more permeable and metabolized to liberate the nucleoside or phosphorylated nucleoside within cells. 40\u221242 While the data from the original full screen does not appear to have been disclosed, a 1\u2032-CN modified adenosine C-nucleoside hit (GS-441524), along with a prodrug form of the monophosphate of GS-441524 (GS-5734, later renamed as remdesivir), was found to be highly potent. 43 GS-441524 and its S-acyl-2-thioethyl monophosphate prodrug had previously been reported in 2012 as potent leads from a series of 10substituted 4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine C-nucleosides, with broad activity against a panel of RNA viruses: yellow fever virus (YFV), Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2), influenza A, parainfluenza 3, and SARS. 44 The primary assay used was the cytoprotection effect (CPE) assay, in which live virus is incubated with a target cell line and the antiviral activity is inferred by the ability of a test agent to rescue cell death, measured using a standard cell viability reagent. 45 In a 2012 study, GS-5734 showed CPE activity against SARS strain Toronto 2 (IC 50 = 2.2 \u03bcM) without causing cytotoxicity toward the host Vero African green monkey kidney epithelial cells used in the CPE assay (note that different target cells were utilized in viral CPE assays).",

Antiviral activity was confirmed against SARS, MERS zoonotic coronaviruses, 49 as well as the circulating human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, causative agents of the common cold. 50 Furthermore, de Wit et al. demonstrated that remdesivir had both prophylactic and therapeutic activity against MERS in a nonhuman primate in vivo model. 51 The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have been summarized in compassionate use documentation published by the European Medicines Agency (EMA, 2020). Remdesivir is administered via an intravenous injection (IV) with a loading dose on day 1 (200 mg in adults, adjusted for body weight in pediatric patients) followed by a daily maintenance dose (100 mg in adults) for up to 10 days. In nonhuman primates, daily administration of 10 mg/kg of remdesivir yielded a short plasma half-life of the prodrug (t 1/2 = 0.39 h), but sustained intracellular levels of the triphosphate form. 45 In vitro and preclinical in vivo animal models supported the effectiveness of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. These include a recent in vitro study of remdesivir assessing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCov, strain nCoV-2019BetaCoV/ Wuhan/WIV04/2019) using qRT-PCR quantification of viral copy number in infected Vero E6 cells. This study demonstrated an IC 50 of 770 nM and an IC 90 equal to 1,760 nM (with cytotoxic concentration >100 mM). 52 In addition, works by Sheahan et al. and de Wit et al. demonstrated in vivo efficacy of remdesivir at inhibiting viral replication and reducing viral related pathology against related coronaviruses. 51, 53 These findings, along with the safety profile of remdesivir in the clinical trial assessment against EBOV, 54 support the evaluation of remdesivir as a potential therapeutic drug for repurposing against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

            "text": "Antiviral chemotherapeutic interventions often target specific viral enzymes or attack a weak point of viral replication within the host, such as targeting the divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; Figure 2 ). Nucleoside analogues represent a class of antiviral agents that has proven efficacious against several viruses, including hepatitis B and C as well as HIV. Generally, these fall into three general classes: mutagenic nucleosides, obligate chain terminators, or delayed chain terminators. 55 Ribavirin, a mutagenic nucleoside, targets the viral reliance on an RdRp to catalyze the replication of the RNA genome from the original RNA template. 56, 57 In a seminal paper, Crotty et al. demonstrated that the RNA virus poliovirus exists on the edge of viability, due to the proportion of virus particles with deleterious mutations. Furthermore, treatment with concentrations of ribavirin that caused a 9.7fold increase in mutations was sufficient to induce \"error catastrophe,\" in effect lethally mutating the poliovirus, reducing infectivity by 99.3%. 58 Obligate chain terminators, such as azidothymidine (AZT), lack the reactive 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, which directly prevents additional DNA synthesis after incorporation. 59 Lastly, delayed chain terminators, which include remdesivir, block transcription despite still possessing the 3\u2032-hydroxyl and thus can still form a phosphodiester bond with the next incorporated nucleotide. However, evidence suggests that the 1\u2032CN substituent of remdesivir sterically Repurposing or repositioning an effective small-molecule therapeutic promises the fastest therapeutic means to stem the tide of the pandemic. 61 Highlighted is RdRp residue S861, which is predicted to sterically interact with the 1\u2032CN substituent of remdesivir inducing delayed chain termination. 60 clashes with RdRp (residue S861) upon further chain elongation (remdesivir + three additional nucleotides), distorting the positioning of the RNA and hampering translocation to the remdesivir + fourth position ( Figure 2 ). 60 Remdesivir (GS-5734), a prodrug, is metabolized within cells into an alanine metabolite (GS-704277), further processed into the monophosphate derivative and ultimately into the active nucleoside triphosphate derivative (Figure 3 ). Nucleotide analogues are not highly cell permeable, and once in the cell they require di-and then triphosphorylation to produce the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) that can be utilized by the viral RNA-dependent polymerases for genome replication. As such, NTPs can then be misintegrated into viral RNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP; Figure 2 ). To address this, an approach to antiviral drug design can employ the utilization of phosphoramidate prodrugs (ProTides, inferred as prodrugs of nucleotides). 62\u221265 Protides are composed of a nucleoside monophosphate capped with an aryl group and an amino acid ester (a phosphoramidate). Following diffusion into the cell, the prodrug is presumed to metabolize in a sequence of hydrolytic steps that starts with esterase-mediated ester hydrolysis to a carboxylate that cyclizes internally to the phosphonate ejecting the phenoxide; the resultant unstable cyclic anhydride is hydrolyzed open by water to the alanine metabolite GS-704277 whose P\u2212N bond is hydrolyzed by a phosphoramidase-type enzyme ( Figure  3 ). 66\u221269 This final step liberates the nucleoside monophosphate, which is highly polar, and does not diffuse back across the cell membrane (essentially trapping it within the cell). Subsequent phosphorylation by host cell kinases convert the compound into the NTP analogue that can be used as a substrate by the viral RdRp enzyme. 70 While the nucleoside analogue core of remdesivir, GS-441524, can diffuse into cells, the initial phosphorylation step for nucleosides is rate-limiting (slow), which is believed to account for the reduced antiviral activity of GS-441524 compared to remdesivir. 49, 71 This approach has been successfully applied to a number of FDAapproved antiviral drugs including the Gilead products sofosbuvir (for treating HCV) and tenofovir alafenamide (first approved for treating HIV). 64 Upon diffusion of remdesivir into the cell, it is metabolized into the nucleoside monophosphate form via a sequence of steps that are presumably initiated by esterase-mediated hydrolysis of the amino acid ester that liberates a carboxylate that cyclizes on to the phosphorus displacing the phenoxide. The unstable cyclic anhydride is hydrolyzed by water to the alanine metabolite GS-704277 whose P\u2212N bond is hydrolyzed by phosphoramidase-type enzymes to liberate the nucleoside monophosphate or nucleotide analog. The artificial nucleoside monophosphate is routed to further phosphorylation events (hijacking the endogenous phosphorylation pathway) yielding the active nucleoside triphosphate analogue form that is utilized by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Utilization of the GS-441524 nucleoside triphosphate analogue by RdRp inhibits viral replication through inducing delayed chain termination.",

This selectivity is achieved, at least in part, due to the nucleoside analogues being poor substrates for the human polymerases. 76 Interestingly, in vitro assays demonstrate that the triphosphate form of the inhibitor was incorporated at increased rates compared to natural nucleotide pools, 77 likely adding to strong antiviral potency of remdesivir through premature RNA synthesis termination.",

A recent publication by Sheahan et al. describes the ribonucleoside analogue, \u03b2-D-N 4 -hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) , that has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in vivo against the related SARS virus. 98 Although in preclinical development, EIDD-1931 is orally bioavailable, a significant advantage compared to remdesivir, and has increased potency against viruses containing mutations in RdRp that conferred increased resistance to remdesivir, supporting the potential for a combination therapy to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 becoming clinically drug resistant. Other clinically approved nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, such as the hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir and HIV drugs alovudine and zidovudine, have also been shown to be active against the SARS RdRp in in vitro biochemical assays and might have the potential to be repurposed against COVID-19. 99 For a general review of nucleoside and nucleotide analogues for cancer and viral diseases, including approved drugs and clinical candidates, please reference Jordheim et al. 100 ",

Recently, through a compassionate use indication, remdesivir has supportive evidence for yielding some clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients. 107 In addition, an interim analysis of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (NCT04280705) supports improvement in the primary endpoint for patients receiving remdesivir, compared to control, with a 31% faster time to recovery. 108 Based on these initial findings, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. With no drug having FDA approval for marketing as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, this is the first FDA authorization of an investigational therapeutic for use in treating SARS-CoV-2. 109 While remdesivir represents one compound whose recent use authorization may, in part, mitigate the morbidity, mortality, and strain on global While remdesivir represents one compound whose consideration may yet play a role in mitigating the morbidity, mortality, and strain on global healthcare systems caused by COVID-19, ongoing clinical trials will provide much-needed clarity surrounding the repurposing of approved drugs and experimental agents against SARS-CoV-2.",
