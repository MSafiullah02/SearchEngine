Currently, approximately 40 small molecular compounds have been approved to treat viral infections, at least half of which are intended for patients with HIV infections (De Clercq 2004) . The most prominent class of drugs used to inhibit viral propagation is the group of inhibitors of DNA or RNA synthesis, many of which are nucleoside analogs.

AS ONs (left) exert their effect predominantly in the nucleus, whereas siRNAs work mainly in the cytoplasm (right). Left: An AS ON is transported into the nucleus (1) and base-pairs with the complementary sequence of an mRNA. RNase H is recruited to the hybrid helix (2) and cleaves the RNA moiety. Right: An siRNA double helix reaches the cytoplasm (3). One of the strands is incorporated into a protein complex called RISC, while the other strand is discarded. The siRNA guides RISC to a complementary sequence on the target RNA. Upon binding, cleavage of the target molecule is induced (4). RISC can go on through multiple rounds of cleavage cally occur only once in the human genome, the targeted RNA can be considered to be a highly specific receptor for the AS agent. AS ONs are known to act by two distinct mechanisms. (1) In the cell nucleus, the heteroduplex of a DNA ON bound to an RNA is recognized by RNase H, which cleaves the RNA moiety of the hybrid (Fig. 1) . The RNA fragments are further degraded by exonucleases, whereas the ON is set free and can bind to new RNA molecules in a multiple turnover manner.

ONs consisting of phosphorothioates combine several advantages, including enhanced nuclease resistance and activation of RNase H cleavage (Eckstein 2000) .

In contrast, for DNA viruses or retroviruses with their proviral DNA stably integrated into the host genome, only mRNA (or newly synthesized genomic RNA in the latter case) can be targeted by AS ONs. Thus, only inhibition of virus spreading can be expected, and continuous treatment is required.

Chronic infection with this plus-stranded RNA virus causes liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, often leading to the requirement of liver transplantation. Since current treatment of HCV is unsatisfactory, a need for new, specific anti-HCV drugs stands to reason. AS ONs have therefore widely been used with the intention of inhibiting HCV replication. The 5 -untranslated region (UTR) is one of the most highly conserved regions of the HCV genome and has most frequently been targeted with AS ONs. Since this region is strongly structured, intensive efforts were made to identify accessible target sites. The entire viral cycle of HCV is cytoplasmic and thus AS ONs do not necessarily need to be designed to activate RNase H, which is mainly located in the nucleus. Rather, it has been shown that AS ONs interfering with the assembly of a translation initiation complex on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) inhibit translation of the viral polyprotein in cell-free translation assays and transfected hepatoma cell lines.

Although half of the substances that have been approved for the treatment of viral infections are intended to treat HIV infections, there is still an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. Current drugs are not only too expensive for patients in poor countries; they also exert severe side effects upon long-term treatment and become ineffective due to the emergence of resistant mutants. Numerous efforts to prevent HIV replication with inhibitory ONs have been published (for a review, see Jing and Xu 2001) . Only a few recent examples can be given here. As described for HCV, anti-HIV ONs are not necessarily required to induce virus RNA degradation by RNase H, as they may as well be employed to inhibit essential processes of the viral lifecycle by steric blocking. For example, Arzumanov et al. (2001) developed AS ONs against the HIV-1 trans-activating response region (TAR), a 59-residue stem-loop that interacts with the trans-activator protein Tat. Steric blockade of this interaction by a chimeric 2 -O-methyl RNA/LNA ON prevented full-length HIV transcription. In another study, the HIV-1 dimerization initiation site was chosen to be targeted by AS ONs (Elm\u00e9n et al. 2004 ): An LNA/DNA mix-mer directed against this region prevented the dimerization of the genome and inhibited replication of a clinical HIV-1 isolate in a human T cell line.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 616, "end": 633, "text": "Jing and Xu 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 909, "end": 932, "text": "Arzumanov et al.

No specific antiviral treatments exist for this important pathogen to date. The authors found AS ONs targeting the proximal terminus of the 3 -UTR to effectively inhibit CBV-3 replication in a cardiomyocyte cell line.

Hybridon is developing second-generation AS ONs targeting the gag gene of HIV-1 (GEM92) and the mRNA of the E1 protein of human papillomavirus (MBI 1121). Phase I trials with these ONs showed promising safety results and confirmed the possibility of second-generation AS ONs to be delivered orally. Further ONs are being tested in patients with HBV and HCV infections (CpG 7909 and CpG 10101 by Coley Pharmaceutical and 1018-ISS by Dynavax Technologies).

The first AS drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-in 1998-is a phosphorothioate ON named Vitravene (Fomivirsen).

This problem has been observed in RNAi approaches for sustained inhibition of both poliovirus and HIV-1 (Gitlin et al. 2002; Boden et al. 2003; Das et al. 2004) . Although the siRNAs employed in these studies inhibited viral propagation initially, virus titers increased again upon prolonged incubation. Analysis of the resistant mutants revealed either a point mutation in the target region or extensive rearrangements of the viral RNA. Several strategies may be useful to prevent the enrichment of escape mutants. One is targeting of conserved sequences that are less likely to yield viable virus after mutation. Another is reducing levels of host cellular genes necessary for viral entry or propagation, which has led to substantial reduction of virus titers Novina et al. 2002) . Cellular genes are less prone to mutation and are therefore less likely to allow viral escape of silencing. When pursuing such an approach, however, the risk of side-effects must obviously be addressed thoroughly. In analogy to conventional combination therapy, a third strategy to prevent escape-mutant enrichment involves two or more siRNAs being used simultaneously. We have recently described an siRNA double expression vector (SiDEx) containing genes for two different siRNAs both targeted against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of coxsackievirus B3 (Schubert et al. 2005a; Fig. 4 ). Even when an artificial point mutation was introduced into the target gene so that the respective mono-expression vector was no longer capable of silencing, the double expression vector maintained high silencing activity. Although we did not find any deleterious effect of the simultaneous use of two siRNAs, it has been observed that different siRNAs present in one cell may compete for access to the RNAi machinery (Bitko et al. 2005) . Thus, the efficiency of one siRNA may be compromised due to the presence of a second species. Another difficulty in preventing viral escape may be the amount of viral particles present in the blood of patients in the state of viremia. In HCV infection, up to 10 7 virions per milliliter may be present in the bloodstream, so that even 90% reduction of the titer may still leave enough virus particles intact to allow escape.

Jacque and colleagues (2002) tested a number of presynthesized siRNAs and plasmid-expressed shRNAs against the viral vif and nef genes as well as the long terminal repeat (LTR). These siRNAs suppressed the production of viral particles from an infectious HIV clone 20to 50-fold. The authors also found a dramatic inhibition of viral genomic RNA, complementary (c)DNA, and integrated DNA. From these studies, it can be concluded that the siRNAs employed in this case inhibited the viral life cycle at an early stage. Somewhat different results, however, were presented by Hu and coworkers (2002) who found no reduction of viral cDNA in cells that had been transfected with potent siRNAs against viral gag and pol RNA.

Complete virus clearance by RNAi can be expected only for this type of virus, because viral DNA genomes or DNA intermediates of retroviruses are not susceptible to RISC-mediated cleavage (Fig. 1) . Initial experiments with siRNAs directed against the 5 -UTR of CBV-3 were unsuccessful, most likely due to the stable secondary structure of this region of the viral genome.

Despite being well tolerated in the doses employed, AS ONs and ribozymes frequently failed to provide convincing evidence for their therapeutic benefit. The more recently developed RNAi technology, however, is likely to overcome most of the problems of the aforementioned approaches due to its higher efficiency. Only three and a half years after the initial description of gene silencing by siRNAs in mammalian cells, the first clinical trials based on the principle of RNAi have commenced. Furthermore, siRNAs against cancer and viral targets can be expected to enter the clinic soon. One of the major problems of long-term inhibition of viruses is their ability to escape any kind of treatment due to their high mutation rate. It will therefore be advantageous to select sequences of the virus that are highly conserved. In addition, several distinct regions of the virus should be targeted simultaneously with either siRNA double expression (SiDEx) vectors (Schubert et al. 2005a) or by combining different types of antiviral agents, e.g., ribozymes and siRNAs (Michienzi et al. 2003) .
