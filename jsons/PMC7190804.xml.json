In some places, they cannot avoid wearing masks, so as to make almost unrecognizable their faces. And, in all likelihood, as soon as the availability of masks will be enough in each country, governments will state that people have to wear them when they are in public places until the world will be no longer impacted by threat of Covid-19.",

            "text": "As a result we would have the following options ensuing from such a statement:Consider the French ban on wearing the veil. The prohibition of covering the face for religious or cultural reasons would discriminate between \u2018other reasons\u2019 and \u2018religious ones\u2019, to the point that religion would seem to assume, at least as for this specific issue, a negative value. However, it would remain to be assessed if such a conclusion could be deemed to be in tune with the minimum requirements of liberal constitutionalism and, especially, religious freedom insofar as it is inextricably linked to the same ideal of secularization and la\u00efcit\u00e9 (even the so called la\u00efcit\u00e9 de combat). And besides, it is no coincidence if the ECtHR did not take in account the \u2018la\u00efcit\u00e9\u2019 argument in legitimizing the French ban.Discrimination could be excluded if \u2018religion\u2019 were assumed as something incomparable to \u2018all other possible reasons.\u2019 Nonetheless this conceptual seclusion of religion does not match the social and cultural experience. The modernity project and its champions have carried out the attempt to confine religion outside rationality and\u2014because of something similar to a ripple effect\u2014politics, law, public sphere, economy, etc. Despite the self-aggrandizing rhetoric of secularization, the description of this pervasive plan as an absolute success sounds\u2014as it were\u2014 rather immodest. Such judgment is due not only to the presence of religion and the denominational activities in contemporary societies, which is anything but dwindling, but first of all to the resilience of religion in the ethical and legal categories of the secular languages. Such semantic persistence is not at all a nominalistic relic but rather a consequence of the anthropological significance of religion and the impossibility to dissociate its semantic and pragmatic projections from the cultural vocabulary of secular societies. The modern divide between secular society and religion had great institutional effectiveness,4 but it is largely overestimated as regards cultural categories and habits from ethics to law, from aesthetics to even scientific paradigms. The resilience of religious traits is still tremendously unnoticed in the legal categories comprising private law, criminal law, trade law, corporation law, etc.: in short, the areas of law concerning the organization and the unfolding of people\u2019s daily life, in respect of which it would be essential begin to talk of a \u2018legal theology.\u2019 In many cases, this resilience is silent, almost overgrown, as it is one with the basic schemas of what we call \u2018rationality\u2019 (or better, the grammars of the different rationalities).5 The socio-political consequences of the conceptual and anthropological incompleteness of modern secularization could be dissimulated within the Western societies for many centuries, but they show all their inconsistency and discriminatory effects in contemporary multicultural and multi-religious societies, as happened, and still happens, in colonial and post-colonial contexts. In multicultural societies, the modern attempt to draw a conceptual insulation of religion cannot work as a cognitive presupposition to legitimate a radical differentiation/discrimination of its cultural and experiential projections. Persisting in not acknowledging the inadequacy of the Western \u2018secularization project\u2019 to achieve such effect equals \u2018not understanding\u2019 what religion is from an anthropological point of view and the cultural significance it has, and has played, throughout history of human societies.Another option could be imagined as coextensive with the following argument: face covering would remain banned, as a general rule, but public health reasons, and only these, could support a legitimate derogation from that rule. The assessment beneath this derogation or counter-rule, however, would raise the question of why public health should be considered more valuable than other religious or cultural ones. A possible answer gauged precisely on the behavioral requirements inherent in the Western way of \u2018living together\u2019 could be, in all likelihood, as follows: public health concerns are higher than others because in some cases, like outbreaks, people required by law not to cover their faces in the name of the \u2018Western way of living together\u2019 would obey, on the contrary, the imperative of \u2018dying together,\u2019 and each because of the other. Insofar as life is the pre-condition that makes viable the enjoyment of all other rights, its protection legitimates an exclusive derogation of any rule, as in the case of self-defense, and thereby even the prohibition to cover one\u2019s own face in public spaces. From this point of view, it could also be argued that no one actually ever died for not having covered her/his face\u2026 except for some particular situations in which the face covering is a by-product of the necessity to adopt specific measures and/or tools for health protection. The Islamic veil is ordered to protect neither life, nor health, consequentially it cannot be considered as a valid source/motivation to legitimate derogation to the behavioral standard inherent in the (Western) living together.",

Needless to say, the immediate objection to this dichotomous signification of the \u2018face covering\u2019 would be that what matters about its legitimacy is not the behavior in and of itself, namely taken in its morphological appearances or formal features, but rather its contextual meaning and the related teleological function.",

Subsequently, to compare the different semiotic webs beneath the different behavioral patterns at stake, the related contexts and ends should be translated one into another so as to develop a common semantic and axiological ground to be used in their cross-assessment. To put this discourse in concrete terms, the comparison between the Western standard of \u2018living together with bare faces\u2019 and the \u2018wearing of the veil\u2019 should undergo a crossing appraisal/examination relying on the semiotic (contextual and teleological) webs underlying each of them. Such a survey, as such preliminary to any empirical and axiological judgment, should include an anthropological excursion in the landscapes of sense and experience included in both Western and Islamic imaginaries so as to establish what can be semantically and teleologically considered as analogous, paralleled, reconcilable; or instead incommensurable, divergent and radically incongruous.

Biases, ethnocentrism, semantic and anthropological blindness, reification and discrimination will become, under these conditions, the prominent features of any assessment.

Nonetheless, Grotius\u2019 secularizing formula, which was centered on what would be true, or valid, even if God did not exist (the well-known \u2018etsiamsi daremus\u2019), comprised a kind of re-semanticization of social experience and the legal language. Apparently, Grotius founded the determination of his common legal theology on the rational evidence of many of law\u2019s categories and their morphological evidence. In simple terms, it is as he quipped, speaking to the representatives of the various denominations in conflict: \u201cWell, are the categories of contract, theft, obligation, fraud, etc. perhaps different for you Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans, or Anglicans, etc.? If not, as from a rational point of view it is so, then those categories can be considered true and valid for all of you and by relying on them, all of you can construe the social architecture within which people of different faiths can peacefully coexist in the future.\u2019",

Nonetheless Grotius was in a relatively comfortable position to engender implicit intercultural metaphors, even if rather rough, by referring to the morphological appearances/features of these categories just because he could rely on a cultural and moral-legal background inherited from Medieval tradition and the theological-legal apparatuses elaborated by the Second Scholasticism.10 Grotius\u2019 shaping of the conceptual figurations related to the alleged natural-rational features of contracts, obligations, crimes, etc. was, actually, the result of a silent metaphorical work; or, in any case, it produced metaphorical outcomes. Hence it was generative and not only declaratory. At the same time, the conceptual legal standards so drawn and carved from Roman-Medieval tradition were capable of performing their social functionality only because they rested on a relatively homogeneous common background. Although almost four centuries have passed since Grotius\u2019 De jure belli ac pacis, such relative cultural homogeneity lurks even today beneath the lexicon of European legal experience beyond the differences between common law and civil law.11 It can still be perceived, despite the latent cultural discordance, or even the prejudices, extant between the people with a Protestant bildung and those traditionally Catholic, that is, between Northern and Southern Europe.12 In all likelihood, it does not seem inappropriate to ask if these differences, when not even divergences, are not rooted in cultural discrepancies originating in the rough metaphorization, passed off as nothing but the discovery of pre-existent universal essences, which accompanied and, in some sense, underpinned the modern secularization and jusrational/natural law doctrine.",

What remains still unnoticed in the process of rationalization and\u2014in Cartesian terms\u2014clarification of ideas that substantiate the modern path towards Enlightenment is its crucially creative signification and processive gist. \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 conjures up not a fact or, a state of things, but instead a periphrastic disposition imbuing the intertwining of the human mind and the environment, namely human experience. \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 is not a reified condition, nor an ontological arrival point, as rather the action of \u2018illuminating\u2019 and \u2018being illuminated.\u201914 Nothing is better suited to express such disposition than the process of metaphorization. But, as observed above, it is the same process at work behind Grotius\u2019 proposal and rhetorical strategy encapsulated in his proposal for culling the \u2018morphological appearances\u2019 of legal categories shared by people of different faiths as the ground on which to build a peaceful coexistence among differences. The (relative) success of Grotius\u2019 project in neutralizing the denominational-political conflicts of early modernity is entirely due\u2014in my view\u2014to the re-semanticization/metaphorization that it silently entails. Symmetrically, its conceptual flaws, incompleteness, and dis-functionalities, which the contemporary world is still atoning for, depend on the misunderstanding of its metaphorical nub and the subsequent leaning toward the reification of experience and the related categorizations (that is, the Dialectic of Enlightenment). Still, Grotius taught, at least to Westerners, that if what is apparently belonging or ascribed to the religious domain is also endowed with other profiles of \u2018commonsense significance\u2019, the features supporting these alternative categorizations are to be focused and exploited in order to construe a semantic social contract, namely a lexicon, for peaceful coexistence amidst and through differences.15",

In this regard, and differently from the method adopted by Grotius, it should be emphasized that the \u2018common\u2019 does not coincide with some already shaped morphological appearance of things. If it does, the entire operation would be in danger of falling prey to ethnocentrism and the silencing of \u2018implicitness\u2019, that is, the semiotic network underlying any categorization molded according to a specific cultural perspective.16 For example, if the \u2018common feature\u2019 of the veil were considered only for its \u2018being materially\u2019 a piece of cloth put on the face, almost inevitably the reasons and the normative-axiological axes invoked in order to legitimate the different views about wearing it, or not, will be declined in polarized/antagonistic terms. But this approach would preclude, in and of itself, any chance of conducting an intercultural/metaphorical translation. As usual, one part of the controversy would claim for the right to wear that piece of cloth for some reason, while the other one would try to delegitimize the \u2018fact\u2019 involved in that claim for other reasons. In legal terms, this means that the constitutional values/principle, or the human rights enunciations, will be involved and exploited for the purpose of the dispute only as instrumental and rhetorical weapons, but without any genuine commitment to carry out an intercultural understanding and translation. Each part would try to cling onto one or another of them (and the related semantic spectrum) taking the focused principle/value as an axis for the hierarchical legitimation of her/his own claims but lacking any concern for the possibility, if not the need, to give room to some \u2018meaning transactions\u2019 concerning her/his own assumptions. In doing so, each part would try to take advantage of the semantic vagueness of constitutional and/or human rights enunciations in order to articulate claims bereft of justifications that are self-reflexively situated and responsive from a semiotic-intercultural perspective. The overall result would be that the ensuing conflict between the values/principles called into play by each part and the related balancing test entrusted to the judge would be carried out on the basis of reified worldviews: as such completely caged within the apparent contrasts between the morphological appearances of the objects or the behaviors, and dramatically cut off from any semantic translation/transaction between the semiotic networks underlying their apparent features (according to each of the different cultures at play).",

In this regard, for example, a far more apt term of equivalence in translating the significance of the veil into the Western semantic horizon would be everything in this culture that plays the psycho-social role of a symbol of decency. The Islamic veil has a lot of possible semantic declinations inside the Islamic culture, but certainly its psycho-aesthetic function in women\u2019s self-perception cannot be excluded. Although it may appear a bit provocative\u2014but without a shadow of disregard for the cultural and religious implications tethered to the icon-veil\u2014I would suggest considering the equivalence between the wearing of the veil and the habit of wearing underwear. Who could deny that many Western women would feel deeply uncomfortable going around without underwear? Imagine, in this regard, that at a non-Western airport a Western woman was requested to slip off the underwear she wears under her clothes, exactly as Islamic women are currently requested, in International airports, to strip off their veils. I am sure that that the average Western woman would feel insulted by having to comply with such a request. Unfortunately, I am almost sure that to date no average Western woman would realize that what she would feel if forced to put off her underwear for airport security is somehow analogous to what an Islamic woman experiences when she is actually ordered to remove her veil. Just to be clear, in proposing this example I do not want to in any way underestimate, or overshadow, the veil\u2019s religious significance for Muslims and the identitarian meanings it assumes in contemporary times, especially within non-Islamic social contexts.17 Quite the opposite, and symmetrically, I want to stress that it is important not to allow the religious features to cast an umbra on all the other semantic and pragmatic profile related to the veil\u2014which should apply, on the other hand, to all the possible items from any cultural universe. To silence, under the \u2018denotative veil\u2019 of religion and in the name of secularism, all the other meanings and semiotic ramifications stemming from the veil is, on the contrary, to underestimate their axiological and legal relevance. Such an approach\u2014it needs to be reiterated\u2014equals a literal inversion of Grotius\u2019 logic of cultural/legal rationalization, which ends up turning upside down the secularization (metaphorical) strategy through which he gave momentum to the overall subsequent modern legal experience.",

The global semiotics coextensive with its inter-corporeal transitions allowed for it to almost simultaneously dwell in our bodies despite their different nationalities and geographical locations.22 While our minds were feeling still tightly separated from one another, each potentially exempt from any need to translate Otherness and figure out the Other than Self as an Other of and with Self, conversely our bodies were reciprocally contaminating so as to transform the epidemic space in a worldwide continuum.23",

In the adoption of this stance, in some sense, British people displaced Italians in a time, as well as in a space, other than their own. The time distinction and the cultural-semantic diffraction were, however, two sides of the same coin, just like it was for the binomial space/meaning. In this regard, however, it is to be observed that categorical borders draw and differentiate both spaces and times. Symmetrically, the later English-Italian homologation of the Covid-19\u2019s meaning, implications and the related \u2018abnormal\u2019 health measures mirrored\u2014and, in some sense, reconstructed\u2014the simultaneity and spatial continuum actually coextensive with the global semiotics of the epidemical phenomenon. Furthermore it is to be strongly emphasized that under the lens of law both simultaneity and spatial continuity of epidemic assume\u2014as shown above\u2014a potentially retroactive meaning. An immediate implication of such retroactivity is that simultaneity and continuity, taken together, constitute the foil against which the wrongness of the UK Government\u2019s initial assumptions and policy came to the fore also with respect to the evaluative spectrum comprising the legal principles of the UK national legal system, as well as human rights. Nevertheless, there is nothing odd in that.

            "text": "In order to give some concreteness to the above example, consider the UK situation now (April 24, 2020). With respect to the outbreak, it is embedded in a space\u2013time planetary synthesis, which is attuned\u2014even pragmatically\u2014with the space\u2013time rhythm of Covid-19\u2019s spreading, namely its global semiotics. As for the law, in turn, what makes possible such semantic and experiential metamorphoses\u2014think, for example, of the claims for damages by the Italian mothers had they lost custody of their children to the Social Service, or Dr. Jessen\u2019s belated apologies25\u2014are precisely the values/ends of British culture, some of which are included in UK legal system and placed at its hierarchical apex. Such values/ends are, even if in many cases only implicitly, part and parcel of the legal statements and their meanings. This is because in law \u2018is\u2019 always means \u2018ought to be,\u2019 and the way something \u2018is\u2019 must correspond to the way in which it \u2018ought to be\u2019 and \u2018is good.\u2019 In other words, \u2018being\u2019 and its \u2018modes\u2019 (to be interpreted somehow echoing Spinoza) are both subjected to an axiological validation. Such underlying and immanent assessment impinges on the semantic spectrum of factual/empirical categorizations included in legal statements. It occurs because the reference to values compels the interpreter to take the empirical categories included in legal statements as means in view of those values/ends. For this reason, the categorical borders and the semantic spectrum of empirical categories change as the axiological and teleological validation/attunement of the phrastic (descriptive) parts of legal rules tend to remold the checklist of what is to be considered \u2018inside\u2019 or \u2018outside\u2019 each category. In other words, the content of such empirical categories is remolded in order to better fit them to function as means for the values/ends legitimizing the overall legal system. This process of semantic adaptation is further incremented by the trans-categoriality of the axiological/teleological categorizations with respect to the empirical ones. It relies upon the common phenomenon for which some elements included in different empirical categories can prove to be functional as means towards the achievement of the same value/end. Such an occurrence, when is noticed and shows its teleological salience, often urges the interpreters to blur and merge the semantic borders of the empirical categories included in the legal rules and/or statements. In all the legal systems providing a judicial review of legislation, for example, the result of such process of re-semanticization takes the following linguistic form: \u2018the legal rule at stake is, or would be, in contrast with constitutional principles insofar as it does not include/provide for\u2026 something\u2019, or vice versa. Such categorical remolding, however, does not always result in a sentence stating the unconstitutionality of a legal rule. In many cases, it comes as an interpretation in conformity with constitutional principles (in German language, the so-called Verfassungskonforme Auslegung). To put it in more in general terms, the just mentioned trans-categorical continuity can make it so that some categorical checklists will have to be enlarged, and others restricted by reason of the categories\u2019 functionality to one value/end or another, as resulting from their reciprocal balancing. As noted above, of course, this value-driven categorical remolding will be the more incisive, the further the interpreter will be able to open the semiotic networks underlying the empirical categorizations and their morphological checklists. Conversely, when this semiotic open-mindedness does not take place, the morphological features can fall prey to an instrumental use, as such cognitively blind if not even surreptitious, aimed at excluding from categorical borders and the related legal effects what could be axiologically and teleologically considered worthy of inclusion, and vice versa.",

I would like to suggest that there is an important lesson to be taken from this occurrence as concerns the geo-legal scope of the values/ends placed at the apex of each legal system. When legal values/ends are actuated by relying on the semiotic networks beneath the morphological appearances of the phenomena to be qualified by the law, they can function as means of cultural externalization and hetero-integration of the national socio-legal systems. At the same time, this approach can foster their function as interfaces for the intercultural inclusion and the generation of inter-spaces of experience. All in all, from the perspective of Italian migrants the change of direction decided by the UK Government in accordance with Italian public health measures, at least with regard to Covid-19 and the lockdown, equals a path of semantic/spatial translation/transaction. As such it engenders a third intercultural space, a kind of metaphorical dome including both the semiotic/pragmatic geographies of both Italian migrants and UK autochthonous people.",
