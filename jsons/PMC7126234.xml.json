            "text": "Many parasites in nature are associated with a host species, or a group of related species. Examples of host\u2013parasite association can be found in a range of disease systems including HIV/SIV, rabies, malaria, and Lyme borreliosis (Garamszegi, 2006, Hahn et al., 2000, Kurtenbach et al., 2002, Streicker et al., 2010). In certain cases there are natural barriers to the exploitation of multiple host species, e.g. sexually transmitted diseases. Yet other disease systems relying on direct, vectored, or environmental transmission allow for a potentially wide host range. In these systems, the factors that determine whether parasites focus on a narrow range of species or adopt a more generalist strategy are typically not known, yet the mechanisms at play have important consequences for public health and beyond. For instance, zoonotic parasites cause significant human disease burden worldwide (Jones et al., 2008), and any practical disease intervention strategy requires some knowledge of the associated host species. Further, these parasites may transmit through multiple wildlife species. Such complex transmission cycles are robust in the sense that blocking transmission from one host species may only partially control human disease risk\u2014as demonstrated in North American Lyme disease (Tsao et al., 2004). Recently, an urgent hunt for the reservoir host(s) of Ebola virus, Henipavirus, and SARS-coronavirus has implicated bats (Dobson, 2005). Given our limited understanding of the transmission competency of alternative hosts, and of bat-virus dynamics in general, it is unclear if targeting any number of bat species would be effective in reducing human disease risk.",

            "text": "The prevailing data on host\u2013parasite systems suggest there are at least two influential factors in determining a parasite\u2019s host range (Woolhouse et al., 2001): (1) the community-level contact structure, which determines opportunities for cross-species transmission; and (2) the standing genetic diversity of the parasite. Essentially, the combination of host species availability and the potential for adaptive evolution is thought to be the dominant force in shaping a parasite\u2019s host range. A realized host range that is less than all contactable hosts (few infections in some species, despite them being accessible to the parasite) reflects a degree of host association by the parasite or strain. A central concept is that host\u2013parasite association results from host specialization; the adaptive evolution of the parasite, leading to a specific host preference (Levene, 1953). The difficulty with host specialization is that it does not easily explain how many parasites routinely cross the species\u2019 barrier, unless we invoke recurrent adaptation by the parasite. For example, a parasite that evolves a preference towards one host species is unlikely to cause an outbreak in an alternate species, unless a mutation occurs that either enhances cross-species transmission, or improves within-species transmission in the alternative host population. While this condition is plausible for rapidly-mutating viruses, it is cumbersome for relatively slow-evolving bacteria and protist parasites, and, we argue, not the only mechanism that can explain variable patterns of host\u2013parasite association in nature.",

Specifically, we focus on the role of superinfection in driving host associations and cross-species transmissions\u2014two common, empirical phenomena that appear to be at odds with each other.

            "text": "The model depicted in Fig. 1\nand the system of equations in Section  2 represents a host\u2013parasite system of two host species (S), denoted by subscripts 1 and 2, and two parasites: A and B. Infected hosts are classified as either I1A, I1B, I2A, I2B. Host populations recover from losses (natural mortality and disease-induced mortality, also called virulence) via a density-dependent birth rate, bN=(b0\u2212b1N)N, where b0 is the density-independent birth rate and b1 is a density-dependent factor. Both strains have a higher transmission rate between hosts of the same species compared to cross-species transmission, reflecting a degree of ecological separation between host types, controlled by parameter r. Parasite B transmits within each host species at rate \u03b2SI, where \u03b2 is the transmission rate. Parasite A transmits at rate \u03b2SI in both host species, and additionally is capable of superinfection (infecting an individual currently infected by parasite B). The superinfection rates are q\u03b2SI for I1 and \u03b5q\u03b2SI for I2. This assumption articulates that we regard A as an aggressive mutant, which superinfects I1B preferentially (that is, parameter \u03b5<1 ensures the superinfection rate of type 2 hosts is lower than that of type 1 hosts). The reasoning for this assumption is that the ability to superinfect a host is jointly dependent on the aggression of the superinfecting strain (to outcompete the inhost resident strain) and host\u2013specific immunity (to permit secondary infection), i.e. a combination of host and parasite effects. It is therefore conservative to assume that distinct host species differ in their degree to permit superinfection ([I1B\u2192I1A]\u2260[I2B\u2192I2A]). Potential specific mechanisms include differences in the cost or quality of immune activation, which may be initiated (or exacerbated) from immune priming by an unrelated parasite (Telfer et al., 2010), or by species-specific energy expenditures, such as migration (Altizer et al., 2011, Weber and Stilianakis, 2007). The parameter \u03b5 allows a range of superinfection disparity to be explored. The outcome of superinfection is immediate takeover of the IB individual by strain A, yielding an IA individual. Rates of primary infections of both hosts by both strains are equal; there is no intrinsic host preference. As a consequence of its aggression, strain A carries a greater virulence cost (reflected by v) in I1 and I2 subpopulations than strain B (where virulence is modeled by \u2212fvI with f<1). We examine a range of differences in virulence costs between strains. We set equal population sizes and growth dynamics of S1 and S2 in order to distinguish the effects of superinfection in isolation, otherwise a larger (or more fecund) host group may confound the advantage or cost of superinfection; we show in Supplementary materials that relaxing these assumptions does not change the general outcome of our model. Initial conditions and parameters are listed in Table 1\n. All deterministic simulations began with strain B at equilibrium followed by an introduction of strain A and an evolutionary period of 500 years. We arbitrarily define a host-associated parasite as having 80% of its infections in one host species.",

Our chief aim was to examine whether appreciable cross-species transmission occurred in the absence of adaptive evolution. Modeling host specializations typically includes some form of explicit tradeoff in parasite transmission (Anderson and May, 1979, Gudelj et al., 2004, Regoes et al., 2000). The essential idea is that a parasite that increases its transmission to one host species does so at the cost of transmission to alternative host types. The cost to the specialist parasite is that by increasing its exploitation of one host, it consequently reduces its exploitation and transmission in alternative hosts (Frank, 1996, Regoes et al., 2000). We model this phenomenon by having two \u03b2 values, \u03b2L and \u03b2H, which represent a low and high transmission rate, respectively. We then compare this asymmetrical transmission model with the superinfection/virulence model in a stochastic framework. Aside from the absence of a single transmission parameter (\u03b2) and the inclusion of two transmission parameters (\u03b2L,\u03b2H), the asymmetric transmission model shares an identical structure with the other models.",

            "text": "Our modeling approach builds on previous work (Gudelj et al., 2004, Nowak and May, 1994, Regoes et al., 2000) with several novel extensions: (1) we incorporate superinfection in a heterogeneous host environment, rather than a single host population; (2) we assume a parasite strain superinfects distinct host species differentially, rather than equally\u2014since primary infections are interactions between a parasite and host that can either mitigate or facilitate superinfection (Sadd and Schmid-Hempel, 2009, Telfer et al., 2010, Ulrich and Schmid-Hempel, 2012); and (3) strains do not have a transmission advantage in either host species. At low levels of virulence, the superinfection advantage of A outweighs its virulence cost, leading to the complete dominance of A in both host species (Fig. 2\nA\u2014Type I). At moderate virulence, we observe strong host association of the two strains, yielding I1A and I2B subpopulations. This phenomenon is indicated by the \u2018windows\u2019 outlined in dashed boxes in Fig. 2\u2014Type III, which is defined by an 80/20 rule where at least 80% of all hosts infected by a strain belong to one species. Note that a low relative prevalence of A in host species 2 represents a high prevalence of B in host species 2. At higher virulence, the cost of A outweighs its superinfection advantage, which leads to the dominance of B in both host species (Fig. 2A\u2014Type V). Lastly, at intermediate ranges of virulence we find an overlap in the host ranges of either strain (Fig. 2A\u2014Types II and IV), which results from less dramatic changes in the cost\u2013benefit balance of virulence and superinfection. Details on equilibria can be found in  supplemental Figs. S1\u2013S4. In contrast, if a mutant strain were to arise that had only one of the characteristics assumed here (superinfection or virulence) then it would either drive the resident strain extinct (superinfection alone) or go extinct itself (virulence alone) as demonstrated in  supplemental Fig. S5. The variable patterns of parasite coexistence (Fig. 2, regimes I\u2013V) requires both superinfection and virulence in the mutant strain A.",

Fig. 2A represents the strict case where the difference between the mutant strain A in host species 1 and 2 is most extreme (no superinfection in S2;\u03b5=0), and no virulence cost for IB(f=0). We relax the assumptions of superinfection and virulence by allowing A to additionally superinfect B individuals in I2B at a reduced rate (Fig. 2\u2014panels B, D), and by setting a virulence cost for B in both host species (see Fig. 2\u2014panels C, D). The corresponding windows are altered as follows: (1) allowing superinfection in both hosts reduces the parameter space for host association; and (2) including a virulence cost for both parasites increases this parameter space.",

            "text": "Superinfection can explain host\u2013parasite association in a unique manner: intrinsic generalists become host-associated due to outcomes of within-host competition. Conventional thinking dictates that adaptation creates a specialist parasite, and subsequent adaptation enables that parasite to cross the species\u2019 barrier. Superinfection relaxes these conditions of adaptation, and can promote cross-species transmission while maintaining host-parasite associations (Fig. 3\nand Table 2\n). Fig. 3 illustrates a comparison of superinfection versus host specialization and how each scenario influences cross-species transmission; indicated by relative prevalence approaching 0.5 in both host species. Both mechanisms can produce similar, mean levels of host association. However, in the superinfection model, stochastic transmission can allow relative prevalences to transiently deviate from our 80/20 definition of host-parasite association, typifying outbreak dynamics without recurrent adaptive mutations. This is not the case under host specialization, which depicts strains A and B transmitting through preferred hosts with biased transmission efficiencies. In order for host specialization to present stochastic dynamics similar to superinfection, recurrent adaptation is required. Discerning the mechanism responsible for observed host-parasite association patterns from data is not trivial, especially since many time series are data-sparse and cover a short time interval. This finding raises questions on whether surveyed host associations (Brisson and Dykhuizen, 2004, Fallon et al., 2005, Garamszegi, 2006, Sasal et al., 1998, Streicker et al., 2010) are actually examples of host specialization. Host-parasite associations have been observed in distinct host orders (Blanquart and Gascuel, 2011, Fallon et al., 2005, Hanincov\u00e1 et al., 2006); equally, diverse parasite groups have been observed to form structured hosts associations, including macroparasites (Abollo et al., 1998), ectoparasites (Wells et al., 2013), viruses (Streicker et al., 2010), and bacteria (Brisson and Dykhuizen, 2004). Moreover, when host specialization does occur, it can be a consequence of host-parasite association, rather than a cause. For example, relaxed selection (Lahti et al., 2009, Remold et al., 2008) can account for specialization through erosion of (under-utilized) genetic determinants that facilitate transmission to alternative hosts. Another possibility is the fixation of specializing alleles by genetic drift, and not by natural selection. Consequently, the role of host specialization in driving host-parasite associations in nature is potentially exaggerated. A basic test for genuine host specialization is a two-host, two-parasite infection study that demonstrates a host preference either through greater transmissibility or a longer duration of infection. If surveyed host-association data supports host specialization while experimental infections do not, then we can be certain that an alternative mechanism is at play. Superinfection may be operating if there is evidence of a competitive advantage within a host type, and if the competitive parasite carries a high virulence cost relative to a sub-competitive parasite. The most immediate concern raised by our work relates to the study and prevention of zoonoses. Essentially, detecting a majority of parasite infections in a narrow group of wildlife species suggests, but does not confirm, host specialization. Therefore, targeting putative reservoir species through culling or vaccination may have unpredictable, or even undesirable, effects on disease dynamics (Bolzoni and De Leo, 2013, Choisy and Rohani, 2006).",

The two panels show 25 stochastic projections of the relative prevalence of parasite A[IA/(IA+IB)] in host 1 (dark gray) and host 2 (light gray) on the y-axis against time on the x-axis. The superinfection model is parameterized as shown in Fig. 2D; transmission is unbiased at \u03b2=0.0005 and virulence is v=0.0025. White and black lines represent mean prevalences calculated from the stochastic projections. The host specialization model has no superinfection (q=0), no virulence (v=0), and a transmission bias (\u03b2H=0.0008 or \u03b2L=0.0002) for the associated hosts (I1A and I2B). Trajectories that approach the interior of a plot indicate an increase of a parasite (A or B) in a host population from previously low levels; note that a decrease in the relative prevalence of A indicates an increase in the relative prevalence of B. Simulation time represents 40 years.",
