Despite their usefulness, genomics and transcriptomics approaches have certain limitations. First, gene mutations and mRNA expression levels determined quantitatively often do not mirror the real situation in terms of mature proteins. Moreover, translational and post-translational regulation affect not only the level of a mature protein but also its function. In fact, the effects on protein structure and biological function of alternative splicing, post-translational modifications and virus\u2013host interactions cannot be easily predicted by genomics and transcriptomics studies. In light of this, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a unique and necessary tool for system-wide, structural and functional analysis of the effectors of biological functions.",

Proper separation of these mixtures is essential for the accurate identification and quantification of proteins by MS.

In the past few years, this technique has been complemented by a quantitative application (two-dimensional difference in-gel eslectrophoresis (DIGE)) that allows for analysis of the relative changes in protein abundance among different samples [3]. However, owing to recent technical advances, high-resolution nano-liquid chromatography is gradually replacing both 2-DE and DIGE. This is because the low volume and low flow rate of nano-liquid chromatography allows for analysis of proteins on an attomole level, significantly reducing solvent waste and enhancing MS-based protein identification [4].",

Approaches for protein\u2013protein interaction analysis, such as tandem affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation, coupled with MS-based proteomics have elucidated several mechanisms by which viruses exploit host molecular machineries for their benefit, as well as the host countermeasures (Fig. 2). Notably, in one of these proteomic studies, very low-density lipoprotein-associated proteins were identified during hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication complex purification [11], thus revealing that assembly and secretion of very low-density lipoprotein particles are required for virus production and propagation.",
