The causative agent of this disease is FIP virus (FIPV) which belongs to the family Coronaviridae. To prevent FIP, various vaccines such as virulence-attenuated live or inactivated FIPV vaccine have been investigated, but no vaccine has exhibited a sufficient effect and the vaccines rather enhanced the onset of FIP (Woods and Pedersen, 1979, Pedersen et al., 1981, Pedersen and Black, 1983, Pedersen et al., 1984, Barlough et al., 1984, Pedersen, 1987, Stoddart et al., 1988). Intraperitoneal inoculation of virulent FIPV induced more severe clinical signs in anti-FIPV antibody-positive kittens and kittens that received passive immunization with serum or purified IgG from antibody-positive cats than in antibody-negative kittens (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980, Weiss and Scott, 1981). The antibody-induced enhancement of FIPV infection is a serious obstacle to the prevention of FIP by vaccination.",

However, it is also known that some viruses bound to antibodies invade macrophages via the Fc region of the antibody and the Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R) of the macrophage, and eventually, the antibody leads to the enhancement of infection. This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection (Halstead and O\u2019Rourke, 1977). Macrophages are known to be one of the target cells for FIPV and it has been reported that the ADE of FIPV infection is induced by the same mechanism (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Corapi et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1992, Hohdatsu et al., 1998).",

Among these proteins, neutralizing and ADE epitopes are mainly present on the S protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Corapi et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1992). We previously reported that in vitro FIPV infection of feline alveolar macrophages is enhanced by a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the S protein of FIPV. This ADE activity increased with the MAb that showed a neutralizing activity with feline kidney cells, suggesting that there was a distinct correlation between ADE activity and the neutralizing activity (Corapi et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1992, Hohdatsu et al., 1993). The close association between enhancing and neutralizing epitopes is an obstacle to developing a vaccine containing only neutralizing epitopes without enhancing epitopes. Although a recombinant vaccine has been prepared by inserting the gene encoding S protein into vaccinia virus, the vaccine did not prevent FIPV infection and it rather enhanced the onset of FIP (Vennema et al., 1990).",

Among these studies, only the vaccine using recombinant raccoon poxvirus expressing the N gene (rRCNV\u2013FIPVN) reported by Wasmoen et al. (1995) was effective against a low-dose FIPV challenge. However, since they challenged feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) orally after immunization with rRCNV\u2013FIPVN, their study did not show the effect of the vaccine alone.

The vaccinated cats produced antibodies against N protein but did not produce virus-neutralizing antibodies. Cell mediated immunity is considered to play an important role in the prevention of the onset of FIP. A delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin response to N protein was observed in these vaccinated cats. When the vaccinated cats were challenged with a high dose of heterologous FIPV, the onset of FIP was prevented without the induction of ADE and the survival rate was 75%.",

            "text": "This study confirmed that immunization of cats with baculovirus-expressed N protein was effective in preventing the progression of FIP following a high-dose (105 TCID50) FIPV challenge. In cats immunized with this vaccine, the inhibition of FIP progression attained a survival rate of 75%. As described in the Introduction, Wasmoen et al. (1995) reported that in cats infected with FECV after immunization with recombinant racoon poxvuris expressing the N gene, the onset of FIP was 100% inhibited against a low-dose virulent FIPV challenge (103 TCID50). However, their study did not show the effect of the vaccine alone. Our study is the first to report that recombinant N protein alone attained a survival rate of 75% against a high-dose virulent FIPV challenge. Although we used Type I FIPV strain KU-2-derived recombinant N protein as the antigen, the vaccine also inhibited the onset of FIP following a challenge with Type II FIPV, 79-1146 strain. It is still unclear whether this immunization is effective against the same serotype FIPV challenge. Since the pathogenicity of oronasal challenge of KU-2 strain, which may be the natural route of infection, is weak, the vaccine effect on KU-2 strain could not be evaluated using the onset of FIP as the index in this study. Since Type I FIPV/FECV infection is dominant in the field (Hohdatsu et al., 1992), it is necessary to investigate the protective effects against Type I FIPV infection in the future. However, the amino acid sequence of N protein is conserved relatively well among FIPV strains (90% or higher homology; Motokawa et al., 1996) and infection with any type of FIPV may be controlled by use of this protein. No enhancing epitope present on N protein has been reported and no ADE was observed in this study, confirming that this protein is safe. In contrast, Gene analysis of S protein has shown that the amino acid sequences of Types I and II FIPV are very different (about 46% homology; Motokawa et al., 1996), suggesting that it is difficult to achieve an effect on infections with the two types of FIPV when S protein is selected for the vaccine antigen.",

However, virulent FIPV challenge-induced progression to FIP was prevented in the vaccinated cats. Cellular immunity is considered important for the prevention of progression to FIP (Pedersen, 1987). The vaccinated cats developed a DTH-skin response to N protein, suggesting that cell mediated immunity against the FIPV antigen was induced. Weiss and Cox, 1988, Weiss and Cox, 1989 reported that a strong DTH skin response to FIPV antigen was induced in cats that survived FIPV infection after FIPV challenge-exposure. Although the data are not shown, we observed no DTH response to virion-derived N protein in anti-FCoV antibody-negative SPF cats or cats that developed FIP, while cats that tolerated the FIPV challenge-exposure and FECV-infected cats exhibited a positive reaction. These findings strongly suggest that a DTH response to FIPV is associated with increased resistance to disease.",

            "text": "Generally, an inactivated vaccine induces humoral immunity because the vaccine is recognized as an exogenous protein, but the induction of cellular immunity is difficult. However, it has been found that antigens incorporated into immunostimulating complexes or encapsulated into certain liposomes can stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity (Takahashi et al., 1990, Reddy et al., 1992). In addition, Kovacsovics-Bankowski et al. (1993) reported that soluble antigen conjugated to beads more efficiently induced CTL immunity than immunization with soluble antigen alone. It is considered that conversion of soluble to insoluble antigen by binding to beads increases phagocytosis of the antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APC), resulting in activation of MHC class I presenting pathway of exogenous proteins. The recombinant baculovirus-expressed FIPV N protein used in this study was insoluble antigen prepared as follows: recombinant baculovirus-infected SF9 cells were disrupted in RSB buffer containing 0.2% NP-40 and centrifuged at 800\u00d7g for 10 min, and the precipitate was resuspended in PBS. Use of insoluble N protein as the vaccine antigen may have induced cellular immunity including DTH response more efficiently. The antigen prepared as described above may have contained baculovirus-derived antigens. It has recently been reported that baculovirus itself could induce non-specific anti-viral effects in mammals (Gronowski et al., 1999). Therefore, there is a possibility that baculovirus-derived antigen(s) has some synergetic effects on the successful protection.",
