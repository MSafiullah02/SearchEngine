Although the typical clinical picture is mainly related to the respiratory system and usually includes symptoms as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, there is ongoing evidence that other body systems might be affected. Neurological manifestations have also been reported [1, 2, 6, 7, 13]; a case of COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy was recently published [9].",

Accumulating evidence has suggested that in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19, a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) may develop; this results in a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure [5]. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the cytokine cascade could cause intracerebral hemorrhage [7]. COVID-19-induced cytokine storm syndrome could be another of the factors behind the occurrence of cerebrovascular events.",

We illustrated the case of a coronavirus-positive 36-year-old patient with unremarkable past medical history that developed a meningoencephalitis with intracerebral and subdural hematomas. On admission, the patient had not been able to report about possible anosmia or dysgeusia due to his state of confusion. Nevertheless, in spite of the contraindication to perform lumbar puncture to detect the presence of the virus in CSF, we had considered the coronavirus infection as the only possible etiology from early diagnostic assessment. Clinical and radiological data were indeed considered suggestive of this etiology; the patient had no history or physical/radiological evidence of head trauma, and imaging had ruled out the possibility of vascular abnormalities and showed findings certainly consistent with viral infection. Later on, our clinical suspicion was eventually confirmed by the analysis of the fluid obtained from the surgical evacuation of the chronic subdural hematoma.",
