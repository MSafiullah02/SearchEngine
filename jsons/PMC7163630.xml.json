This fate is governed by the characteristics of the species and habitat it has entered (Williamson & Fitter, 1996; Richardson & Py\u0161ek, 2006). The ecological definition of invasiveness has been discussed at length by Williamson (1999), Lonsdale (1999), Davis & Thompson (2000), Rejm\u00e1nek et al. (2002), and Colautti & MacIsaac (2004). Despite these discussions, ecologists have struggled to classify successful invasions, partly because successful invasions are quite rare. According to the \u2018tens rules\u2019 (Williamson & Fitter, 1996), a species has approximately a 10\u22126 probability of becoming a pest once introduced to a novel ecosystem.",

The first Stage (0) begins when a propagule enters the habitat of interest. A species proceeds through Stage 1, dispersal and survival in the habitat, and Stage 2, survival and reproduction. If the weed satisfies these criteria, it may then be classified into separate stages that describe the frequency and abundance of a species in an environment. Stage 3 species are considered localized and numerically rare. Stage 4a species are widespread but rare, Stage 4b species are localized but dominant in those localities, and Stage 5 species are considered widespread and dominant (Table 1). Again, the environment can be any region of interest. The definitions of widespread and abundant are also open to interpretation. In essence, all three frameworks put forward a series of hypotheses that can be applied to data to classify the invasive characteristics of a species. The data requirements necessary to implement the frameworks vary, although each draws heavily on frequency and abundance information to classify the invasive characteristics of a species.",

Alien plant species such as Cryptostegia grandiflora and Ziziphus mauritiana are present in the catchment and affect the productive capacity of pastoral properties in this catchment (Grice et al., 2000). However, the extent of their geographical distribution and possible impact along the riparian zone remains unknown. Other alien grass species, such as Andropogon gayanus, have dramatically altered ecosystem function in other Australian rangeland systems and may be present in this catchment (Rossiter et al., 2003).

The frameworks present a series of hypotheses about invasion and apply these to data. We propose evaluating weed invasions as part of a larger, existing plant community where invasive species are classified based on their relative abundance, frequency, and cover at local and landscape scales. This approach differs from those proposed by the authors of previous frameworks as species are classified using all available data acquired from an extensive, multiscale landscape survey of species frequency and cover. The patterns derived from multivariate analyses may help formulate hypotheses about invasion processes in the landscape of interest and can be applied to any data set. Once critical invasive species have been identified, management strategies can be formulated to target important species in the ecosystem.",

Nine transects were surveyed at each site and this was the maximum possible value. Quadrat frequency per site frequency provides an indication of the mean number of quadrats occupied by the weed when present. The maximum possible value was 90. The two relative frequencies indicate the extent to which a species occupies a given site. For each species, these indices collectively capture the variation in frequency and cover at three spatial scales. Site frequency and total cover provide information on these effects at the landscape scale. Transect frequency per site and cover per transect explain the effects of a species along a 100 m transect within a site.

Small groups of species were agglomerated into larger groups using the same method and this iterative process continued until all species formed a single group. In this way, group membership was optimized at each stage of the agglomeration, and was essentially a local, or single stage optimization (Gordon, 1999).

Dispersal distance (short or long) was derived from site frequency, not from an understanding of the species dispersal mechanism. Plants with high site frequency (> 35 sites out of 80 surveyed, or 43%) were considered long\u2010distance dispersers, whereas those occupying fewer sites were considered short\u2010distance dispersers. Uniqueness to the region, whether common or novel, was difficult to classify from the data alone. Davis & Thompson (2000) argue that species introduced into North America during colonization should now be considered common as they are unlikely to ever be eradicated. Nearly all the species surveyed here satisfy that criterion, with most present in Australia for over 100 years. Therefore, all cluster groups were considered common. Impact, either little or great, was determined as cover per quadrat. Species occupying more than 5% of a quadrat when present were considered to have a great impact, and those that occupied less than this were considered to have a small impact. Impact was assessed at a very local scale. Site and transect level impacts were excluded from the assessment for parsimony, although the three measures were strongly correlated (Fig. 2b).",

In general, there was an orthogonal relationship between site frequency and cover per quadrat, cover per transect, and cover per site. This suggests that the area occupied by a species, captured by the various measures of cover, was unrelated to the processes governing its dispersal at the catchment scale, as represented by site frequency. However, dispersal within site, measured by quadrat per site and transect per site, was correlated with cover per site and cover per transect.

These frameworks put forward a series of hypotheses about the process of invasion and are intended to enable ecologists to qualitatively assess characteristics of invasive species and group them concordantly. The three frameworks require different criteria to perform the classifications. Application of the frameworks is further complicated by the subjective interpretation of classification criteria and implementation of the classification systems. Taxonomic classification systems, such as soil classifications (e.g. Isbell, 1996) or land systems (e.g. Tongway & Hindley, 1995), traditionally use a key that can be repeatedly applied to the soil or to a landscape. The classification systems employed in the present study have not been developed to the extent of soil or landscape classification systems, possibly because the data necessary to evaluate their performance was unavailable. Their application is invariably subjective. For example, if we had considered species occupying more than 20 sites to be \u2018widespread\u2019 (Colautti & MacIsaac, 2004) and \u2018long\u2010distance dispersers\u2019 (Davis & Thompson, 2000), then the number of species categorized as Stage 5 widespread and abundant (Colautti & MacIsaac, 2004) and long\u2010distance, common with great impact, would have increased from five to eight species. Every application of these frameworks is likely to be different and arguably site and scale specific, with different interpretations of what is frequent, abundant, local, common, high\u2010impact, or long\u2010distance dispersal. The frameworks were also unable to make use of additional available data, such as the cross\u2010scale indices used in this study. Given these limitations, it seems unlikely that widespread application of these frameworks, in their current form, can advance the field of invasion ecology. This may be because each framework has a discrete set of hypotheses about what constitutes a serious invader. The suitability and application of these hypotheses to a localized problem, with unique or inappropriate data, may not always be relevant for managerial purposes.",

            "text": "There are elements of subjectivity in application of the clustering algorithms to the frequency and abundance data. This subjectivity exists at two levels. First, the decision to cut the dendrogram at a height of seven is arbitrary. Cutting at a height of 12 would have resulted in just three groups and yielded groupings synonymous with those derived from the classification frameworks. For example, groups 2 and 3 would have been amalgamated, even though group 3 species were present, on average in 12 more sites but occupied just 10% of the quadrat when present. In contrast, group 2 species occupied 23% of the quadrat. We consider it productive to preserve this variation in the data since it potentially reflects key differences in modes of invasive spread that should be considered in management. Thus, group 2 species, while having the capability to become regionally common, probably through a greater capacity for long\u2010distance spread, rarely become locally dominant. In contrast, group 3 species appear to spread well locally and become dominant where they occur but at present have not dispersed as widely. In practical terms, management strategies could target group 3 species because they have yet to disperse widely. They may also pose a greater threat to the ecosystem simply because they occupy a larger portion of the quadrat and transect when present. Alternatively, group 2 species have demonstrated proficiency for dispersal. If this trend continued, these species could threaten a much larger area, but with slightly lower levels of cover than group 3 species. Group 4 species displayed a similar penchant for dispersal, but occupied very minor portions of the transect or quadrat. These are arguably the hardest species to classify with confidence. Because they are successful dispersers, they have the potential to threaten the ecosystem, although at this point in time their effect is minor. Our interpretations of the effect of species from group 5 and group 6 are also based on the frequency and abundance data at this point in time. Their presence and overall effect in the catchment are minor. However, our analyses and interpretations are limited by the data available. Additional information, such as time since introduction into the catchment may alter the assessment, but these data were unavailable for most species. Some species may still be adapting, or may not have had the opportunity to establish a sufficiently large population to create a problem. Individual species in groups 4, 5, and 6 may indeed be sleeper weeds and become a greater problem than they are. This concept was recently reviewed by Grice & Ainsworth (2003).",

Alternative distance measures would be required if data were categorical.

The similarities between the seven variables imply that meaningful classifications of invasive species can be achieved with a reduced sampling effort. The simple site level indices derived in this study also provide insights into how invasive a species may become at a larger scale. The particularly strong relationship between cover per transect and total cover in the landscape suggests that, if a species consistently occupies more than 10% of a transect in a specific habitat, then it has the potential to impact and invade that habitat. The link between these scales is worthy of further study to determine the relationship between local and regional impact by species at a certain stage in the invasion process. It may be argued that a species that occupied even a small portion of the landscape in one location has overcome many of the barriers to colonization identified in Richardson et al., 2000's framework and has the potential to invade similar habitats, providing a dispersal mechanism exists.",
