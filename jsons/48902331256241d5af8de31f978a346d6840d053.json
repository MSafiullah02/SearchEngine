In the current pandemic phase, all patients should be considered as potentially infected. Thus, the level of precaution recommended for the caregivers depends more on the type of procedure than on the patient's proved or suspected COVID-19 status. Procedures that are particularly at high risk of contamination are clinical and flexible endoscopic pharyngolaryngological evaluation, and probably also video fluoroscopic swallowing exams. Voice rehabilitation should not be considered urgent at this time. Therefore, recommendations presented here mainly concern the management of swallowing disorders, which can sometimes be dangerous for the patient, and recent dysphonia. In cases where they are considered possible and useful, teleconsultations should be preferred to face-to-face assessments or rehabilitation sessions. The latter must be maintained only in few selected situations, after team discussions or in accordance with the guidelines provided by health authorities.",

The decision to maintain these urgent indications must be validated by team discussions or should rely on official recommendations from health authorities \u2022 Several procedures are to be considered as at very high risk of caregiver contamination: clinical and flexible endoscopic swallowing assessments (especially since food tests require that the patient not wear a mask), flexible endoscopies, insertions of nasogastric tubes and video fluoroscopic swallowing exams, although the risk level of the latter remains under discussion \u2022 When these risky procedures cannot be postponed, the following personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for caregivers: protective glasses, FFP2 (N95) mask, cap, gloves and gown). Caregivers must learn the appropriate dressing and undressing technique.",

For the time being, treating patients with swallowing disorders is considered to be a high risk of COVID-19 contamination for caregivers. The situation is likely to change in the very near future with the help of infectious diseases specialists.Recommendations regarding the assessment of patients suffering from swallowing disordersWe recommend assessing these patients only in cases of emergencies that cannot be postponed and only in a hospital environment. The decision to maintain face-to-face evaluation should be taken after team discussion or on the basis of official recommendations issued by the health authorities. Such situations are rare, and the majority of investigations may be postponed to a time when the patient is not suspected of contagiousness anymore. A teleconsultation might be planned if it is likely to be useful and if the patient's condition allows it.Clinical and flexible endoscopic assessments of swallowing are not routinely recommended due to the impossibility of maintaining the adequate level of precautions (patient not wearing a mask for tests involving food, distance of less than one meter between the caregiver and the patient's face) and to particularly high risks of projections of virus-laden droplets (coughs, sneezes, spitting, etc.).Video fluoroscopic swallowing exams require the same PPE for all participants as during other procedures involving the airway. In cases of food aspirations, especially for liquids, any procedure should be postponed to a period when the patient is no longer contagious. If oral feeding is impossible, an alternative method of nutrition should be put in place after discussion with colleagues.",

In those selected cases, even if flexible endoscopy is not required and if the patient is relatively unlikely to have COVID-19, the examination must be performed carefully and both the patient and the caregiver must wear a surgical mask. When a flexible endoscopy is performed, the usual PPE used in any airway procedure is required: head cap, FFP2 mask, protective glasses and possibly a full face protection with protective visor, gloves and a gown.",
