Blacks are disproportionately affected by poverty [1], mass incarceration [2], infant mortality [3], limited health care access [4], and health-related conditions including heart disease [5], diabetes [6], stroke [7], kidney disease [8], respiratory illness [9, 10], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [11]. Many are well versed in this marginalized status and possess first-hand accounts of the devastating impact of social injustice that permeates through communities. The continent of Africa has also known the impact of inequity and maintains 25% of global disease burden [12]. Perhaps these unique social conditions led numerous individuals in Black communities in America and the world over to accept the myth of Black immunity to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); the potential for immunity against a global crisis presented one less struggle amongst the many formidable challenges.",

During the outbreak, a young Cameroonian student who resided in China was infected and became the first African to contract the virus. He received treatment for the illness in China, and within a few weeks, he recovered from the condition [13]. Subsequently, various unsubstantiated reports emerged declaring that the genetic constitution of Blacks or even the presence of melanin rendered Blacks immune to the virus. The news spread via social media and in social settings even as prominent Black figures reported that they contracted the virus [14].",

Today, HIV has ravaged Black communities by disproportionately affecting Blacks who maintain the highest rates of infection amongst all racial groups [15]. Furthermore, while there are countless reports on the ages of those affected and the greater tendency for men to succumb to the disease, there is an unmistakable lack of reported and accessible data on the racial and ethnic composition of those infected with COVID-19. The scarcity of this information generates a more substantial concern in which insufficiently identifying the affected may ultimately result in historically marginalized groups shouldering the greatest burden of disease and disproportionately bearing the social impact.",

By the end of January 2020, the first US case was reported in Washington state and was identified in a man who had returned from Wuhan; by the end of March, the US became the epicenter of the pandemic accounting for the most reported cases worldwide. While New York harbored the greatest number of cases, concerning trends began to arise just weeks into the enforcement of social distancing guidelines with news reports outlining the rapid spread of the disease in cities that could potentially become the next hot spots including Boston, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. A larger proportion of Black Americans reside in these cities compared with the overall US population of 13.4%. According to the US Census, Black people consist of 78.6% of the population in Detroit, 59.7% in New Orleans, 47.4% in Philadelphia, 30.1% in Chicago, and 25.3% in Boston. The concern is that Blacks tend to live in close communities and an infectious agent has the ability to spread amongst this group due to proximity. The culmination of Blacks maintaining greater disease burden, higher poverty rates, limited health care access, higher rates of jobs in service industries where they are less able to work from home [16] with a subsequent increased exposure risk, and the unfolding spread of the virus in cities with larger Black populations is a forewarning that if disregarded may constitute imprudent action.",

At the end of March, news quickly spread that Democrats are requesting data from the federal government that outlines the racial disparities in the country\u2019s response to the crisis [18]. They emphasize that the existing and pervasive disparities will likely ensure that a national response will not impact American communities equally. The importance of the racial and ethnic breakdown of those affected cannot be overemphasized and may also impact philanthropic initiatives reaching communities [19]. The concern is that while there is an existing threat of an infectious disease that has the potential to infect and devastate many, the particularly vulnerable will experience a greater proportion of disease burden and social upheaval that includes increased mortality, limited health care access, economic collapse with loss of wages and housing, and an overall lack of resources and equity to sustain in a dynamic crisis.",

Although the medical community has experienced surprise and adverse events in the past [20], the unprecedented nature of this crisis is a complete shock to the system. In particular, the health care system quickly realized that the rapid influx of ailing citizens would outpace the available supplies from personal protective equipment to ventilators, and even personnel. The economic collapse is unimaginable and continues to unfold. A great concern is that by not systematically identifying the affected, we may repeat similar acts of unpreparedness when addressing the racial and ethnic disparities of the disease. Therefore, all measures taken must entail concerted and deliberate efforts that incorporate the expertise of leaders in the field to address high-priority issues, and any haphazard attempts will not suffice and may even exacerbate the feeble conditions of the most vulnerable. First and foremost, data and trends on numbers from racial and ethnic groups affected by COVID-19 must be provided by the state and national health departments. Second, we must prospectively understand and respond to the specific challenges taking place with people of color and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We call for a National Commission on COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, a dedicated body to envisage essential recourse and mobilize to action the necessary safeguards. Deploying a National Commission exhibits prudent action that protects the many racial and ethnic minorities who at baseline do not have a safety net; they are the unprotected who are branded with an imposed status as the first to endure impact.",
