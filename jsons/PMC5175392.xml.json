This is particularly so in genetic-association studies where the expected true (when there is a true association) odds ratios for common SNPs with common complex diseases (such as ARDS) is repeatedly found to be 1.1\u20131.4; this means that studies have low power unless there are >1000 subjects [12, 15]. This empirical evidence (Table 2) suggests that Bayesian methods, which keep statistical evidence (conveyed traditionally by the P value and more usefully by the BF) distinct from inductive inferences about hypotheses, are useful because they incorporate data external to the study (estimation of priors) in order to arrive at a conclusion about a hypothesis (posterior probability of the probed association being true) [9\u201312].",

These reports were well done according to reporting guidelines [15]. We ask three questions to improve interpretation of these (and, in general, future) gene-association studies in critical care.Priors: how likely is an association to be expected given information external to the study? Considerations are listed in Table 3. In gene-association studies for complex diseases, the prior is usually in the range of 0.001 (SNPs with only limited prior evidence) to 0.1 (SNPs that already show fairly compelling evidence for association), and in non-replication studies is likely closer to 0.001 [14].\nMinimum BF and PPV: what does the evidence from the study show us? Considerations are listed in Table 3. Assuming a P value threshold 0.01 to 0.001, for a prior of 0.01 the PPV is (assuming power of 0.5) 38\u201382%, and for a prior of 0.001, 8\u201340% [14].Bias: do we need to modify these estimates for study bias? Considerations are listed in Table 3. If bias is low (0.05\u20130.2 = \u201cthe proportion of probed analyses that would not have been \u2018research findings\u2019, but nevertheless end up presented and reported as such, because of bias\u201d), power is 50%, and prior is very high (0.1), the PPV that a statistically significant finding is true is 35\u201355% [12].\n",

The posterior probability (PPV) that there is an association between exploratory SNPs and severity of ARDS in children is low given the low prior probability, the modest BF (reflected in modest P values and power), and potential for bias. This is not necessarily a problem if our interest is in generating hypotheses for further scientific study [13]. An interesting hypothesis has been suggested (i.e., a gene association) and warrants further investigation; we should wait for replication in additional larger studies before accepting this hypothesis. These future studies will have a prior probability that is closer to 0.1 (the posterior probability after the current study), and thus replication would move us much further toward accepting the hypothesis [13\u201315]. Overall, caution is warranted: most genetic associations for ARDS in adults have not replicated [8].",
