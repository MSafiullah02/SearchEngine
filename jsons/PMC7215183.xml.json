            "text": "With its interface position in social psychology and economics, negotiation research touches upon many areas of viable research including that of Nobel laureates such as Kahneman and Nash or renowned researchers such as Rubinstein and Ury [24, 38, 70]. While many articles deal with some effects of power, only limited attention is paid to the actual source of this negotiation power. On the whole, most authors agree that negotiation power is the driving force, both with regard to negotiation processes and outcome [27]. Still beside the most prominent source of negotiation power, alternatives, limited attention has been paid to other power sources and their interaction. That said, there is still a lack of systematic research into the drivers of bargaining power, which is reflected by Agndal et al. [2] who state: \u201cA few studies address the issue of power [\u2026].\u201d [2, p. 11]. However, recently several authors have looked into the variety of sources of negotiation power and their respective interdependency [6, 18, 27, 37]. At the same time, we are observing a period where negotiation experts are increasingly concerned with the abuse of power negotiations by international politicians. The Negotiation Journal of the program on negotiation of the Harvard Law School dedicated a whole special issue in early 2019 to the potential impact of President Trumps approach to hard bargaining and the unilateral use of power in negotiations [13]. In this context, Pruitt [64] recognizes the need for a better understanding of the role of time in negotiations.",

Within negotiation research, authors have contributed in different fields with very specific concepts such as Rubinstein [59, 70], Nash in game theory [54, 55] and Fisher and Ury in conflict resolution [24]. Howard Raiffa is regarded to be the first to establish a comprehensive and cross-disciplinary approach to negotiation research [65, 66] where he identified time and information as potential sources of power alongside the importance of alternatives. Building upon this, Eichst\u00e4dt et al. [18] very recently provided a first approach to compare drivers of negotiation power. In parallel, Galinsky et al. [27] added status and social capital to the list of potential negotiation power drivers.",

The simple intuition here is that the better one\u2019s alternatives, the better one\u2019s position of power in a negotiation [71]. The obvious appeal of this concept has resulted in a certain lack of empirical studies that examine power drivers beyond the BATNA concept, thereby hampering the assessment of the strength of individual power drivers [42, 46]. This is confirmed by Agndal et al. [2] who list only six (1.2%) relevant studies in a meta-analysis of 490 studies on business negotiations. Moreover, the studies do not shed light on the drivers of bargaining power but rather on the effects of having power [2]. Unfortunately, there is not even a reliable framework to measure negotiation power or compare the force of different sources of power. In view of this, the strengths of distinct bargaining power drivers have not been compared to each other systematically [7].",

            "text": "Following the thoughts of Galinsky et al. [27], this paper focuses on comparing two distinct sources of power: alternatives and time. Time plays an especially vital role in most buyer-supplier contracts. Typically, one side has a bigger interest to close the contract and win the business. Maybe it is a buyer to ensure production needs to start soon, or maybe it is a sales agent, trying to ensure he gets his bonus. In Just-in-Time based industries, companies put themselves under the risk of coming under heavy pressure of suppliers, if they threaten to stop supply briefly [63]. In project-based industries, such as the energy sector and wind farm construction, delivery timing forms an essential part of contracts and requires special attention throughout the respective project [15]. The importance of time is also highlighted by professional negotiation advisors who are very successful in negotiation consulting, but do not actively publish in the scientific arena [28, 82]. In order to facilitate the analysis and comparison of power levers in negotiations, we propose a simple concept allowing the magnitude of different power levers to be evaluated by manipulating the levers across otherwise stable experimental settings. Moving towards the empirical study, the paper firstly provides a definition of social power before taking a look at the concepts at hand when it comes to alternatives and time in negotiation research. In doing so, attention is directed at the experimental design of previous studies. Our experimental design aims to incorporate the findings from previous studies while remaining realistic so as not to dilute practical implications. In this way, a dyadic, multi-issue and face-to-face buyer-seller negotiation is simulated. The paper closes with the derivation of theoretical and practical implications and suggests ways to further explore the driving forces of negotiation power.",

In particular, the relational aspect of power cannot be stressed enough; it is the cornerstone of Emerson\u2019s power dependence theory and also the key to Dahl\u2019s concept of power [14, 21]. The first question regarding the origin of power has been discussed extensively in literature and received a comprehensive and continuously evolving framework from French and Raven. However, the effects of various power instruments in negotiations received limited attention, especially in the field of management. Only very recently have Reimann, Shen and Kaufmann [69] looked into the effects of power use in buyer-supplier relationships and the use and effects of applying coercive power [69].",

            "text": "Most individuals intuitively agree that having an alternative in a negotiation increases one\u2019s power. In his power dependence theory, Emerson laid the groundwork for the BATNA concept as he states that one\u2019s power is subject to mutual dependence on each other [21\u201323]. Consequently, having an alternative unilaterally reduces the dependence of one stakeholder and thus increases his/her bargaining power. A large number of studies have investigated the impact of alternatives in negotiation with different moderating factors pointing to the conclusion that alternatives improve one\u2019s position of power. Nevertheless, the variance in experimental setting makes it hard to compare the different and sometimes contradictory results. Moreover, even though the concept of BATNA seems to be rather simplistic, the operationalization is not and Sebenius states that BATNA can be \u201cproblematic, limiting and even misleading\u201d [72, p. 1].",

These manipulations led to a variety of findings which are ambiguous in some respects [41]. In particular, a lively discussion has formed on the effect of alternatives in terms of the integrativeness of an agreement [89]. Sondak and Bazerman [74] and later Pinkley et al. [62] concluded that an asymmetric power structure leads to a better joint outcome. Both studies involved a job contract negotiation and were conducted with graduate students but their manipulation was slightly different in that three conditions (high, low or no BATNA) were included in the study of Pinkley et al. [62] contrasted with two BATNA conditions in the study of Sondak and Bazerman [74]. The opposing camp argues that a symmetric power structure leads to a better joint outcome because the frequency of exchange is increased which generates more positive emotions [45, 49].",

            "text": "Multiple studies have dealt with situational factors which can be grouped into three categories: 1) Negotiator\u2019s characteristics, 2) Negotiator\u2019s decision making, and 3) Other endogenous factors. Studies in the first category involve the impact of emotions [81], social motivation [29, 88], self-efficacy and goal orientation [1, 6]. The studies show that emotions alter concession-making behavior and that an individualistic vs. pro-social motivation leads to more or less competitive negotiation behavior [29, 81]. Having a specific goal or self-efficacy or even both leads to a better individual outcome [1]. Studies on the effect of risky choices [44], choice of negotiation tactic [4] and initiation of the negotiation [47] fall into the second category [43]. Especially noteworthy is the finding of Magee et al. [47] which shows that high-power negotiators are more likely to make the first offer. The final category encompasses endogenous factors that are not directly influenced by the negotiating parties themselves. The studies include the impact of the role of negotiators, size of the bargaining zone, initial offer, and knowledge of the power and quality of BATNA [11, 17, 30, 61, 85]. For the paper at hand, the impact of role is especially interesting and is reviewed by Olekalns [58] who concludes that under equal conditions buyers outperform sellers in terms of profit per transaction, total profit, and number of transactions [5, 20, 57]. Similarly, Neale et al. [36] support this finding by saying that buyers outperform sellers in symmetrical power negotiation in which they manipulated the role information of the parties [36]. Moreover, Eliashberg et al. [20] showed that buyers are perceived as having more power than sellers and reach higher profits in a buyer-seller negotiation on ski caps. In brief, the finding that buyers outperform sellers seems to be robust, as shown by the manipulation of moderating factors such as goal setting or framing [36, 48]. In addition to this, an interesting study by Schaerer et al. [71] demonstrated that having multiple alternatives might actually decrease your individual outcome.",

Back then, game theorist Ariel Rubinstein formalized an abstract idea into a concrete concept of either fixed bargaining costs per round or time-dependent costs that reflect the preferences of the negotiating parties. In the case of fixed bargaining costs, the parties would arrive at an equilibrium because the party with greater time preference would settle immediately in order to avoid unnecessary costs. In contrast, Rubinstein [70] describes time-dependent costs in terms of a discount factor \u03b4it \u2264 1. This would mean that after two negotiation rounds, party 1 would receive \u03b412 x and party 2 would receive \u03b422 x. The party with the lower discount factor therefore has an advantage and can use this against the more impatient party [59, 67, 70].",

Looking at the game-theoretical contributions to this topic, Mosterd and Rutte [53] found out that negotiators who act on behalf of somebody else negotiate more competitively under high time pressure. Similarly, Sutter, Kocher and Strau\u00df [78] examined the effect of time pressure on negotiation behavior and saw that the rejection rates increased under high time pressure. They therefore concluded that time pressure in situations that are new to the parties involved leads to losses in efficiency. In the same year, Gneezy, Haruvy and Roth [32] showed that agreements are usually reached at the end of a deadline. While all of the game-theoretical results give us an indication about the general perception of time pressure and its influence on a negotiation, the generalizability of the findings to real-world negotiations is limited due to their specific assumptions (e.g. complete information) and negotiation setting (e.g. ultimatum game).",

Even though Carnevale and Lawler [8] and De Dreu [16] applied different negotiation settings, both studies suggest that time pressure and an individualistic orientation lead to more impasses and in general more competitive behavior. Additionally, Stuhlmacher and Champagne [77] demonstrated with their experiment that time pressure reduces the response time and that having additional information about the other party leads to a negotiation advantage [77]. An interesting and at first glance counterintuitive result is provided in studies of Moore [52]. The studies showed that revealing a deadline has a positive impact on the negotiation outcome because the concession making is faster and less time is wasted as a result.",

The experiment includes 50 participants negotiating one on one, of which 68% were male and 32% were female. It was conducted at HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management and within the scope of an executive training program for HelloFresh AG, which means that a student sample and a professional buyer sample were involved in the experiment. The students were motivated by offering them the possibility to exchange their negotiated outcome for pens of varying quality. The professionals were motivated by both the distribution of chocolate coins based on their performance as well as their fear of losing face in front of their colleagues. The best negotiators were announced publicly and received special recognition of their achievement by the senior management. Additionally, at the beginning of the experiment it was stressed that their performance would be measured based on their individual results. This amplified the individualistic orientation of the participants. In order to reduce the effects of cognitive biases, individuals received an introduction to behavioral economics including the anchoring and framing effect. The parties did not receive any information on their opponents such as age, previous education, etc., as it was assumed that the exposure to the specific negotiation setting was comparable for both negotiation training courses (at HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management or as part of the executive training program). However, professional buyers in the executive training program had a generally larger exposure to professional negotiations than the students (Professional buyers and students were not mixed in the experiment). Prior to the negotiation, the setup was tested with several dyads with students from HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management in order to calibrate the time cost and the alternative. Generally, the setting followed an experiment conducted by Eichst\u00e4dt et al. [18] who applied different power manipulations in executive training programs in the automotive sector. In contrast to the earlier experiments, the following experiment tested more significant manipulations of time costs and compared the negotiation outcome of having increased time costs with having a BATNA.",

Moreover, deadlines are perceived very differently and thus the resulting behavior varies [50, 75]. In this regard, buyers had to negotiate under twice as much time costs as sellers in this experiment and so 0.5 points per minute were deducted from their result. This approach is based on the reasoning of the Rubinstein model but uses penalties instead of discounting to simplify the decision making for participants.

With the identification of two drivers of bargaining power, time pressure and alternatives, the study sensitizes negotiators to the importance of assessing the impact of both on their individual position of power. In fact, an interesting real-life example of managers underestimating the effect of time on the power balance in negotiations could be observed in the German automotive industry in 2016. The relatively small supplier Prevent forced Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker Volkswagen to shut down its plants for almost a week by stopping supply after Volkswagen refused to pay for investments in a joint project (VW says 6 plants hit by production stoppages, 2016) [63, 83]. Ultimately, the final agreement was perceived as a bad deal for Volkswagen and a big success for Prevent and shows that negotiation outcomes are not just driven by classical definitions of power like size, economic power and potential to use coercion and reward [69].",

One can create artificial deadlines by defining a specific schedule for the negotiation or scheduling the departure of the negotiation team. While time pressure is perceived by most people as problematic and limiting, it is a two-edged sword which might have an upside.

While students appear to be especially affected by time pressure, professionals can adjust to it and make better use of the provided alternative. This raises the question as to whether experience on the part of the negotiators actually influences the force and impact of negotiation power. The results could indicate that more experienced and professional negotiators benefit from two effects. Firstly, they are able to better use negotiation power with regard to alternatives to their advantage and, secondly, it seems that they are less easily influenced by time pressure to make significant concessions too willingly.",

Our study builds on those findings by adding time as a fifth source of bargaining power and gives an empirical foundation for defining alternatives and time as drivers of bargaining power [27].

In a typical buyer-seller negotiation, the parties consist of multiple individuals and often multiple rounds, so the decision making might be altered.",

Additionally, it could be insightful to include a more thorough analysis of the influence of time pressure on satisfaction or the perceived relationship. Finally, over the course of three rounds of negotiations, learning effects might occur which distort the behavior of the later rounds compared to that of the first.",

In order to improve the validity of results, several measures need to be taken. Firstly, the experiment should be extended to a higher number of participants from both groups of students and professionals. In addition, it would be recommended to actually measure and quantify the amount of experience, status and knowledge the professionals have in order to test if this alters the impact of negotiation power in line with the findings of Galinsky et al. [27]. Secondly, research on the perception of time pressure and alternatives should be intensified in order to derive a comprehensive approach and calibrate those drivers for research. Thirdly, we have to keep in mind that buyer-seller negotiations always involve humans and the perception of power is thus central to understanding power. Additional research on perception could clarify the underlying cognitive mechanism and help negotiators in their preparations. Finally, additional research should broaden the consideration of other power drivers such as information or social capital to examine their effect and relative strength. The methodology laid out could be easily adapted to measure the impact of sources of negotiation power as put forth by Galinsky et al. [27].",
