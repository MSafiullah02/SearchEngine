On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and called for accelerating diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs developments to combat this novel disease. Apart of the new coronavirus, influenza virus infections have been a consistent threat to the global public health over the years. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that, so far during the 2019-2020 winter season, there have been at least 39 million illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths from influenza (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm). Considering the current concomitant circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections, the exploration of available and viable anti-influenza drugs to treat both diseases is of great interest.",

Previously, we reported that favipiravir (T705), an antiinfluenza drug approved in Japan and China, showed a certain efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro 3 . In addition, arbidol, an anti-influenza drug targeting the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is being used in a clinical trial against COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029573) and has been recently added to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (sixth and seventh editions) in China. A recent retrospective study suggested that arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients 4 . However, to our knowledge, there has been no systematical analysis about the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs against SARS-CoV-2.",

The drugs include arbidol, baloxavir, laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir 5, 6 . The M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) were not considered in this study since they were not recommended for treating influenza by WHO due to drug resistance. First, the cytotoxicity of the compounds in African green monkey kidney cells, Vero E6 (ATCC-1586) was measured by a standard cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay. Then, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in the presence of either compound or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. The dose-response curves were determined by quantification of viral RNA copy numbers in the supernatant of infected cell at 48 h post infection (p.i.). As demonstrated in Fig. 1a , arbidol efficiently inhibited virus infection in vitro. The 50% maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of arbidol was 4.11 (3.55-4.73) and 31.79 (29.89-33.81) \u03bcM, respectively, and the selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ) was 7.73. Baloxavir partially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection (~29%) at a high concentration of 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 1a) . In contrast, laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir did not exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity even at the highest drug concentrations (Fig. 1a) . The antiviral effect of the compounds was also evaluated by observing cytopathic effects \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020",

As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 , at 48 h p.i. only in cells treated with arbidol, but not with the other five drugs, viral NP expression and CPE due to SARS-CoV-2 was substantially reduced.

The stage of SARS-CoV-2 replication targeted by arbidol was explored by conducting a preliminary time-of-addition experiment using virus at an MOI of 0.05. Arbidol was incubated with cells during the virus entry process (Entry), the post-entry stages (Post-entry), or the entire process of infection (Full-time) and progeny virus yield was quantified by qRT-PCR. The data revealed that arbidol efficiently blocked both viral entry and post-entry stages. It had a profound impact on virus Entry (~75% inhibition) with a lesser effect on Post-entry events (~55% inhibition rate) (Fig. 1b) . In addition, western blot analysis (Fig. 1c) and immunofluorescence microscopy ( Supplementary Fig. S2) confirmed that the expression level of viral NP was reduced drastically at Full-time (13% of the DMSO group, Fig. 1c) , and showed more inhibitory effect at the Entry stage (41%) than at the Post-entry stage (61%).",

By contrast, at 60 min p.i., a slightly higher percentage of virions were transported to ELs in the arbidol-treated group (22.4%) than in the DMSO group (18.3%) (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1e, f) . At 90 min p.i., significantly fewer virions (~13.5%) were detected in ELs in the DMSO group; whereas significantly higher proportions of virions (~23.6%) remained within ELs in the arbidol-treated group, suggesting the drug trapped the virus in the ELs (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1e, f) .

Likewise, we found arbidol plays a role in interfering SAS-CoV-2 binding (Fig.  1d ) and intracellular vesicle trafficking (Fig. 1e, f) .

Functionally, it appears to block virus entry by impeding viral attachment and release from the ELs. Although the SI of arbidol is relatively low (SI = 7.73), as a repurposed drug, its pharmacokinetics profile such as maximal concentration (Cmax) is more important for predicting efficacy. It is generally believed that if the Cmax achieves EC 90 , the drug is very likely to be effective; while if the Cmax achieves EC 50 , the drug is possibly effective in vivo. In humans, a single oral administration of 800 mg of arbidol results in Cmax of~4.1 \u03bcM 15 , and this dosage is efficacious and safe against different influenza viruses with EC 50 values ranging from 2.5-20 \u03bcM 7, 16 . Arbidol also showed anti-inflammatory activity, which may enhance its efficacy in vivo 16 . Considering the EC 50 (4.11 \u03bcM) of arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to, or even lower than those of influenza viruses, we, therefore, suggest that arbidol is potentially effective to treat COVID-19 patients. However, the current dose of arbidol (200 mg, 3 times/day) recommended by the Chinese Guidelines may not be able to achieve an ideal therapeutic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and should be elevated. This needs to be verified by clinical trials.",
