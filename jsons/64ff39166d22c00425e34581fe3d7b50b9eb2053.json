            "text": "We present the mathematical analysis of generalized complex contagions in a class of clustered multiplex networks. The model is intended to understand spread of influence, or any other spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of interconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed to be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model, where each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may depend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being spread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions, probability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis provides a generalization of previous approaches and is especially useful in problems related to spreading and percolation. The results present nontrivial dependencies between the clustering coefficient of the networks and its average degree. In particular, several phase transitions are shown to occur depending on these descriptors. Generally speaking, our findings reveal that increasing clustering decreases the probability of having global cascades and their size, however, this tendency changes with the average degree. There exists a certain average degree from which on clustering favors the probability and size of the contagion. By comparing the dynamics of complex contagions over multiplex networks and their monoplex projections, we demonstrate that ignoring link types and aggregating network layers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about contagion dynamics, particularly when the correlation of degrees between layers is high.",

            "text": "The study of dynamical processes on real-world complex networks has been an active research area over the past decade. Some of the most widely studied problems include cascading failures in interdependent networks [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , simple contagions (e.g., disease propagation in human and animal populations [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , etc.), and complex contagions (e.g., diffusion of influence, beliefs, norms, and innovations in social networks [26] [27] [28] [29] ). Recently, the attention was shifted from single, isolated networks to multiplex and multilayer networks [17, 18, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . This shift is primarily driven by the observation that links in a network might be categorized according to the nature of the relationship they represent (e.g., friends, family, office mates) as well as according to the social network to which they belong (e.g., Google+ vs Facebook links), and each link type might play a different role in the dynamical process.",

We solve for the critical threshold, probability, and expected size of global cascades and confirm our analytical results via extensive simulations. The main observation from our results is that clustering has a double-faceted impact on the probability and expected size of global cascades. Namely, we show that clustering decreases the probability and size of cascades when average degree in the network is small, whereas after a certain value of average degree, clustering is shown to facilitate cascades.",

There has been recent interest [30] in understanding whether monoplex projection of a multiplex network (obtained by ignoring the colors of edges and aggregating the layers) can still capture the essential properties (e.g., cascade threshold and size) of a diffusion process. In the affirmative, this would eliminate the need for considering the full multiplex structure of real-world systems in tackling similar problems. We show that even in the simplest case where all link types have the same influence weight (i.e., c 1 = c 2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), monoplex theory may not be able to capture contagion dynamics accurately, reinforcing the need for studying multiplex networks in its correct setup. We observe that the accuracy of monoplex theory in capturing cascade dynamics over multiplex networks depends tightly on the assortativity (i.e., correlation between the degrees of connected pairs) of the network. For instance, when assortativity is negligible, monoplex theory is seen to predict cascade dynamics very well, while in highly assortative cases its ability to predict contagion behavior diminishes significantly.",

It has been reported [18, 28] many times that threshold models of complex contagion exhibit two phase transitions as the average degree increases; a second-order transition at low degrees marking the formation of a giant component of vulnerable nodes and a first-order transition at high degrees due to increased local stability of nodes. Here, we consider a multiplex where one layer has degree distribution Poi(\u03bb) while the degree in the second layer follows Poi(\u03bb/\u03b1) with probability \u03b1 and is zero with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b1. In this setting, we observe that in general there exist two intervals of \u03bb for which cascades are possible, amounting to four phase transitions as opposed to two; also, it is seen that only the first transition is second order while the remaining ones are first order. However, depending on the value of \u03b1, these regions may overlap (with overlap starting when \u03b1 exceeds a critical value) resulting again with only two phase transitions; see Sec. VI C for details.",

Put differently, real-world social networks are usually not treelike and instead have considerable number of cycles, particularly of size three; i.e., triangles.

Namely, an inactive node i with m i active neighbors and d i \u2212 m i inactive neighbors will become active only if m i /d i exceeds \u03c4 i drawn from a distribution P (\u03c4 ). More precisely, nodes update their states synchronously at discrete time steps t = 0,1, . . . , and an inactive node will be activated at time t if the fraction of its active neighbors exceeds its threshold at time t \u2212 1; once active, a node can not be deactivated. A major concern with this model is that it assumes all links in the network have the same importance, irrespective of the context that the spreading is being considered. However, in real-world contagion processes, each link type (e.g., co-workership versus family or physical links versus online social network links) may play a different role in different cascade processes. For example, in the spread of a new consumer product amongst the population, a video game would be more likely to be promoted among high school classmates rather than among family members; the situation would be exactly the opposite in the case of a new cleaning product [58] .",

It is known [18, 28] that threshold models of complex contagion exhibit two phase transitions as the average degree increases, a second-order transition at low degrees that marks the formation of a giant vulnerable component and a first-order transition at high degrees due to increased local stability of nodes, namely, due to the increased difficulty of activating high-degree nodes. Given that clustering is known to decrease the size of giant component [31] , we expect that it will be more difficult for a clustered network to contain a giant vulnerable cluster. This is why the lower phase transition in complex contagions appear later (i.e., at larger degrees) as clustering increases. On the other hand, the cycles of size three (i.e., triangles) that are common in clustered networks can help trigger cascades when average degree is higher. For instance, in a treelike network a single active node can only activate its vulnerable connections. However, in a triangle, an active node may first activate one of its vulnerable connections, making it possible for the third node to be activated (which now has two active neighbors) even if it is not vulnerable. This is what pushes the second phase transition to higher degrees.",

One of the key differences between the two cases is the resulting assortativity. When \u03b1 = 0.1, only 10% of the nodes have red stubs, each of which can only be connected with other red stubs in the multiplex network case. Put differently, in this setting a small fraction of the population will have statistically higher degrees than the rest, and the additional links they have can only connect nodes with high degrees together. This leads to a positive correlation (i.e., assortativity) between the degrees of pairs of connected nodes. However, in the monoplex projection, the additional edges can be used to connect any two nodes, resulting with very little to no assortativity in the network. Obviously, when \u03b1 is close to one, almost every node will have the additional edges and the above phenomenon will not be observed. Our simulation results confirm this intuition as we see that assortativity is negligible (\u223c10 \u22124 ) in both monoplex and multiplex cases when \u03b1 = 0.99, while with \u03b1 = 0.1, assortativity varies (as \u03bb r = \u03bb b increases) from 0.05 to 0.2 in the multiplex case while still being negligible in the monoplex case.",

This setting allows us to tune assortativity without changing the mean degree in the network. In particular, assortativity will increase as \u03b1 decreases (by virtue of a small fraction of nodes forming a highly connected cluster) [31] . In addition, this setting allows us to compare the contagion dynamics in multilayer networks when the upper layer is (i) small but densely connected (small \u03b1) versus (ii) large but loosely connected (large \u03b1); see [31] for relevant results for bond percolation processes. Using the above degree distributions, we generate monoplex and multiplex networks as in Sec. VI A and analyze the complex contagion process. In Fig. 7(a) , we see that when \u03b1 = 0.99, which leads to very limited assortativity, the difference between monoplex and multiplex networks is negligible. This is in parallel with what we observed in Sec. VI A. However, decreasing \u03b1 to 0.1 leads to two interesting observations in Fig. 7(b) . First, instead of the commonly reported two phase transitions [18, 28] , we observe four phase transitions in the cascade size as \u03b1\u03bb r = \u03bb b increases. Second, we see a significant difference between the monoplex projected theory and multiplex theory, with only the multiplex theory matching the simulations well.

Therefore, the first couple of phase transitions taking place at very small \u03bb b values can be attributed mainly to red edges. First, \u03bb b becomes large enough (e.g., gets to around 0.1) that the subnetwork induced only on the red edges contains a giant vulnerable cluster, giving rise to global cascades; note that at this point \u03bb b is so small that blue edges do not create enough local stability to prevent cascades from happening. However, after \u03bb b reaches a certain level (around 0.65), the subgraph on red edges, having average degree of 10\u03bb b , reaches the second phase transition point where cascades stop due to the increased local connectivity of nodes. These first two transitions being second and first order, respectively, also confirms that they are primarily due to the red edges.",

This interval is then followed by a region where \u03bb b is large enough difficult in the cases where system parameters are not known exactly but estimated, e.g., social network applications. that the subgraph on blue edges has a giant vulnerable cluster. However, the emergence of a second-order transition in the whole network is prevented here due to some of these nodes turning stubborn as a result of their red edges. Eventually, however, \u03bb b becomes large enough that even with occasional stubborn nodes present, a giant vulnerable cluster emerges. This point is reached much later in monoplex networks as compared to the multiplex networks. This is because in the former case stubborn nodes (with red edges) are equally likely to be connected with any other node, while in the latter case they are mostly connected with each other; thus, in the latter case they are less likely to inhibit the emergence of a giant vulnerable cluster on blue edges. Finally, the system goes through a fourth transition when \u03bb b becomes large enough that even nodes with only blue edges become highly connected and hence stubborn. We see that this final transition point is reached much later in multiplex networks than monoplex networks, meaning that cascades take place over a broader range of \u03bb b values in the former case. Again, this can be attributed to the high assortativity seen in multiplex networks that leads to extremely stubborn nodes (that have both blue and red edges) being isolated from those that are mildly stubborn (that have only blue edges). On the other hand, in monoplex networks, every node is able to connect with the extremely stubborn nodes, and thus the critical value of \u03bb b at which cascades become impossible due to high local stability is reached much earlier than that in multiplex networks.",

            "text": "In Sec. VI B, we have observed the possibility of having more than two phase transitions in the cascade size. As discussed there, multiple phase transitions occur mainly due to the setting (14) that, with small \u03b1, ensures a small fraction of nodes having significantly higher connectivity than the rest, while also being mostly connected with each other. Since the existence of more than two transitions has not been reported in previous studies, we are interested in exploring it further. In particular, we now investigate the impact of \u03b1 on the number of phase transitions as well as transition points. Of particular interest will be to find the critical \u03b1 value that separates the cases where four phase transitions occur from those with only two transitions, e.g., the \u03b1 value for which the two cascade regions overlap. For simplicity, we only consider multiplex networks in this section. Figure 8 shows the expected size of global cascades under (13) and (14) for three different values of \u03b1. We see that global cascades take place over a single interval of \u03b1\u03bb r = \u03bb b when \u03b1 is large (e.g., \u03b1 = 0.99) while over two disjoint intervals when \u03b1 is small (e.g., \u03b1 = 0.1). When \u03b1 is somewhere in-between (e.g., case \u03b1 = 0.166) it is possible to have the cascade intervals partially overlap. In such cases, we only see a single interval where global cascades take place. However, an additional transition point appears, manifested by a shift of slope in cascade size, marking possibly the overlapping point of (what would be) the two cascade intervals. Figure 8 allows us to comment also on the impact of the size and density of the online social network layer in facilitating influence propagation. With (14) in effect, a small \u03b1 corresponds to a social network with few but densely connected individuals, while large \u03b1 corresponds to a social network with many subscribers, each with few connections on average. In all cases, the total number of edges in the social network is fixed by virtue of (14) . We see from Fig. 8 that the comparison between the three cases leads to a multifaceted picture as the mean number of links \u03b1\u03bb r varies. For instance, the large but loosely connected case of \u03b1 = 0.99 leads to the largest expected global cascade size over a certain interval, but it has the smallest cascade interval among all three. The intermediate case of \u03b1 = 0.166 seems like a stretched version (over the x axis) of the case with \u03b1 = 0.99. In particular, this case leads to the largest interval where global cascades are possible, although the expected cascade size is smaller than that obtained with \u03b1 = 0.99 (and also with \u03b1 = 0.1) over certain intervals. Finally, the case of a small but densely connected extra layer (i.e., with \u03b1 = 0.1), falls right under the case with \u03b1 = 0.166 for most values of \u03b1\u03bb r , although it gives the largest size of all three in small intervals where \u03b1\u03bb r is very small or very large.",

We solved analytically for the condition, probability, and expected size of global cascades, and confirmed our results via extensive computer simulations. One of our key findings is to show how clustering affects the probability and expected size of global cascades. We also compared several interesting properties of complex contagions on a multiplex network and its monoplex projection. We demonstrate that ignoring link types and aggregating network layers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about contagion dynamics, particularly when assortativity is high. Finally, we show that linear threshold models do not necessarily exhibit two phase transitions as previously reported. Depending on assortativity, we show that both in monoplex and multiplex cases (with two link types) it is possible to observe four phase transitions.",
