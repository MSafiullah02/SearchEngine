Injuries are one of the most common of these problems. Another medical problem which could be a reason for athletes' training abstinence is infection. Certain circumstances in sport may increase the susceptibility of athletes to infectious diseases. On the other hand, athletes with infectious diseases may be at risk for severe complications if they continue their physical activity. Finally they may have transmittable diseases, so other people including sports competitors, trainers and even audiences could be at risk. Transmission of infectious diseases in sports usually occurs via direct contacts, fecal oral routs, common source exposure and airborne or droplets [1, 2] .",

These risks are high especially during 1-2 weeks after heavy training [6] . In a marathon, 33 .3% of athletes who ended the marathon got an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) during the first two weeks [7] . There are two theories regarding sports and the immune system. Some experts hypothesized a J-shaped relationship between physical activity and respiratory tract infection. According to this theory, regular, moderate activity strengthens the immune system and decreases rate of viral infection. While severe, prolonged activity (including marathon) has a transient inhibitory effect on immune system which may predispose athletes to URI and malignancy [8] . According to the second theory, immune system function is suppressed for at least several hours after intensive exercise, this time is an \"open window\" and the risk of infections may be increased in this period [5] . However, despite these attractive theories, there are a few studies which evaluate the effect of exercise on different parts of immune system [5, 6, 9] .",

Different families of viruses cause URI including rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial, Para influenza and Influenza. Close contact with infected patients is the main way of transmission. Transmission through aerosols has been approved for rhinoviruses and influenza [17] . Higher prevalence of common cold in high contact sports including wrestling is predictable. Water sports such as swimming, predispose athletes to sinusitis, otitis and conjunctivitis. Due to different etiologies, clinical syndrome is different and could be presented as rino-sinusitis, bronchitis, flu-like or croup. Upper respiratory infection is self limited and most patients recover within 3 to 5 days with or without symptomatic treatment. Basic hygiene practices and limiting exposure to infected persons are important in the prevention of URI [2] .",

In athletes with mild to moderate URI with rinorrhea, sore throat and cough (upper the neck syndrome) there is no evidence of more severity, complication or duration of disease following physical activity. However in athletes who have fever, myalgia, arthralgia and tachycardia (lower the neck syndrome), physical activity may increase the severity and duration of the respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, isometric and dynamic contractions may decrease in patients with fever. In this case, bed rest until complete recovery (normal heart rate and body temperature) is recommended [18] . If sore throat is due to infection with Epstein bar virus (EBV), light physical activity could be started three weeks from symptoms onset. Although return to contact activities is more controversial because of the risk of splenic rupture following minor abdominal trauma even in patients with no splenomegaly [19] . In patients with sinusitis and otitis media, diving is forbidden until complete recovery of signs and symptoms and a normal tympanogram in the latter group. Diving is also contraindicated in swimmers with chronic otitis media with tympanostomy tube (Grommets). Athletes with conjunctivitis may transmit infection to the competitors during contact sports (including wrestling) and should not return to sports until complete recovery. Swimmers with adenovirus conjunctivitis are also prohibited from sport. Heavy exercise in athletes with acute bronchitis is forbidden due to increased risk of bronco-spasm and secondary bacterial infection. Athletes with acute bacterial pneumonia need at least two weeks rest before full return to physical activity. However it makes 4-6 weeks in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. Chest X ray has no role in determining the time to return to sport. Return to sport should be gradually and in response to signs and symptoms. Athletes should perform 10-14 days of mild exercise then start up training. In general, athletes should do two days of light exercise for every day of rest.",

Sedative antihistamines are forbidden by International Olympic committee (IOC) in shooters. In swimmers with Grommets, polymixin B plus neomycin and hydrocortisone (PBNH) two drops after swimming, may decrease rate of otorrhea. This agent has approval of both IOC and national collegiate athletic association (NCAA). Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for seven to ten days are the drugs of choice for acute otitis media. Athletes with external otitis need local treatment with PBNH or ciprofloxacin. New quinolones (gattyfloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are drugs of choice for conjunctivitis and duration of treatment is seven to ten days. Acute bronchitis should be treated with NSAIDs and bronchodilators. Antibiotics have no effect on acute bronchitis and are not recommended. Although, in patients with persistent signs and symptoms for more than seven days and/or in final weeks of a preparation for a major competition, empiric therapy with antibiotics could be useful. Athletes with acute pneumonia need emergent empiric antibiotic therapy. Macrolides (Azithromycin or Clarithromycin) are drugs of choice in young adults with no morbidity. Doxycycline is an alternative agent, but photosensitivity in athletes with outdoor sports is a considerable side effect.",

In wet and macerated lesions, Burow's solution can be used for drying the lesions [9] . An astringent soak and 30% aluminum chloride may keep the skin dry, remove crusts and macerated tissue, and kill bacteria responsible for superinfection. Topical antibiotic is recommended with evidence of severe inflammation and early cellulitis in athletes with tinea pedis [28] . Prevention of dermatophytosis in athletes can be achieved by frequent changing of socks, drying feet and trunk by using powder, and wearing ventilated shoes and moisture wicking synthetic socks. Athletes should also wear sandals in the locker room and showers [27] .",

There are at least six viruses (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) developing infectious hepatitis cases, all of which are highly widespread amongst young adults. Globally speaking, in case the infected person is asymptomatic and unaware of his/ her condition, hepatitis A and E are usually carried from person-toperson. The outbreak of enteric viral hepatitis has been mostly witnessed in off-the-field activities. Hepatitis B, C and G viruses are blood borne pathogens. Of the various circumstances required for the spread of bloodborne viral hepatitis, bleeding lacerations or oxidative skin lesions in the infected athlete can be mentioned. Additionally, suffering from a skin lesion or exposed mucous membrane as a portal of entry, there must be a vulnerable athlete who is in a sustained contact with the source individual. Athletes involved in sports in which there is close body contact with others, namely wrestlers and boxers are more susceptible to get infected than those who are at moderate risk of blood borne pathogen transmission such as, players of soccer, basketball and judo. Two major ways through which these blood borne pathogens are transmitted to athletes are utilization of common contaminated syringes for drug injection as well as bleeding wounds during sports enjoying close contact [30] . People who are sexually active and are keen on getting tattoos as well as those sharing personal belongings of one another are also at the high risk of getting infected [33] . Horizontal transmission of hepatitis B in contact sports is an issue to which health care professionals should also pay careful attention [34] .",

It is vital to dress skin injuries such as lacerations, cuts, or oozing wounds during sports up to the time that they are totally healed. 2. Strong attention must be drawn to all types of wounds and injuries by athletes.3. Protective instruments are suggested to be used by athletes in contact sports. 4. All high-risk athletes might undergo tests voluntarily. 5. HBV vaccine is recommended to be taken by athletes. 6. Those athletes who travel to high endemic regions are better to be vaccinated against HAV. 7. In epidemic situations, athletes having contaminated food are advised to take Intramuscular immunoglobulin to prevent HAV. 8.
