Many infectious diseases, including most of the arthropod-borne viral infections, rabies, Lyme disease, hantavirus infections, and arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers (Wolfe et al. 2007), are the outcome of cross-species transmission (CST) of a germ from one species to another. Human infections due to CST of a pathogen are by definition zoonotic diseases as each microorganism\u2019s natural host is a nonhuman vertebrate. Currently, 73 % of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic and many of them have their source in wildlife (Daszak et al. 2000). CST occurs either when humans come into contact (via direct interaction with the infected animal or its excreta, or indirectly via transmission by an insect vector) with an animal pathogen that can also infect humans, or when an alteration occurs in the pathogen\u2019s natural host range that renders the microorganism pathogenic for humans (Klempner and Shapiro 2004). Infectious diseases that occur as a result of CST may lead to pandemics (e.g., primate-to-primate CST: Influenza A virus, HIV, human metapneumovirus, which cause the common cold; nonprimate-to-human CST: SARS, H5N1) possibly due to the immune naivety of the new hosts. Nevertheless, most emerging infectious diseases (EID) are initially considered as transient \u201cspillovers\u201d from a natural animal reservoir and frequently they occur as \u201cdead-end\u201d infections because effective human-to-human transmission cannot be established (Riedel 2006; Davies and Pedersen 2008).",

This last family comprises the Gorillinae, Paninae, and Homininae subfamilies that show a genetic difference of only 2 % or less.

Although not formally proved, it is generally thought that, due to the very high genetic identity (about 98 %) between NHPs and humans, primate pathogens may easily jump from one to the other. Several studies carried out by the World Conservation Society showed that humans share most of their microbes with primates (rodents and bats come second) and that CST is common. Moreover, studies in closely related bat species found that innate similarities in the immune system defenses favor virus exchanges and the ability to infect new hosts, demonstrating that the most important factor for CST is the species genetic closeness, whereas virus mutations and contact rates are less critical (Wallis and Lee 1999). In zoonotic diseases, NHP-to-human transmissions are abundant, but also human-to-NHP transmission is frequently observed, particularly for viral diseases (Table 1). Therefore, besides pathogen mutations or selection, CST could be considered a major way to support disease/parasite spreading and survival (evolution). More than a step in the evolution of an infectious disease, CST appears to be a sudden event that leads to disease emergence, epidemics and/or pandemics via the introduction of a microorganism into naive human populations that can be efficiently transmitted from person-to-person and consequently each new case will result in multiple new human infections. How does a pathogen step across the species barrier and become capable of efficient transmission? Each germ and host system have their own strategies to persist and spread, as the few examples described below will attest.\n",

The five known Ebola virus species are characterized by different geographic locations and case fatality rates and show between 32 and 41 % of sequence differences. The Reston ebola virus species (REBOV) was first isolated from Asian cynomolgus monkeys in the Philippines (Jahrling et al. 1990); it is pathogenic for NHPs and apparently nonpathogenic for humans. Recently, REBOV was also isolated from domestic Philippine swine with severe respiratory syndrome (Barrette et al. 2009). C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebola virus (CIEBOV) has been associated with a single, nonfatal human infection, in Ivory Coast in 1994, but caused an outbreak in a group of wild chimpanzees in the Ta\u00ef forest, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Formenty et al. 1999). Sudan ebola virus (SEBOV) has caused four known human outbreaks (three in Sudan and one in Uganda) with a reported case fatality rate of about 50 % (Leroy et al. 2011). The latest species to be discovered, Bundibugyo ebola virus (BEBOV), was isolated in Uganda in 2007, where it caused a large human outbreak with 116 confirmed cases and 30 deaths (case fatality rate 26 %) (Towner et al. 2008). Finally, Zaire ebola virus (ZEBOV) is the most pathogenic species, with reported case fatality rates up to 90 %. ZEBOV has caused several outbreaks in Central Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo (RC) and Gabon (Leroy et al. 2011).",

            "text": "\nThe Ebola virus affair. The mechanism of primary transmission of ZEBOV to humans, potentially leading to outbreaks, remains unclear in most cases. However, several outbreaks were clearly linked to the presence of/contact with great ape carcasses. For instance, a Swiss ethnologist became infected by CIEBOV in 1994 while autopsying a chimpanzee. The animal and the ethnologist were found to have been infected by the same strain. Another study conducted in the Ta\u00ef forest (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) showed that the disappearance of 11 members (26 %) of a group of 43 chimpanzees during November 1994 could have been due to CIEBOV (Formenty et al. 1999). Similarly, the 1996 Mayibout outbreak in Gabon started among children who had found and butchered a chimpanzee carcass in the forest (Georges et al. 1999). Finally, the Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) outbreaks that occurred in Gabon and RC between 2001 and 2003 were associated with the major outbreaks among chimpanzees and gorillas that have killed thousands of animals during the last decade in parts of Gabon and RC, devastating the local animal populations (Walsh et al. 2003; Leroy et al. 2004a; Bermejo et al. 2006). Primary human transmission has been reported in hunters who became infected after handling animal carcasses found in the forest. Similar sources of infection have been described for the Marburg virus, the other member of the Filoviridae family. Indeed, the 1967 outbreak in Marburg and Belgrade was linked to the handling of organs and tissues from vervet monkeys imported from Uganda.",

            "text": "\nA complex emerging pattern. The chronological and geographic characteristics of the different outbreaks in Gabon and DRC between 1995 and 2003 suggest a drift from north-east Gabon toward DRC. This raises the possibility that gorillas and chimpanzees are succumbing to a single outbreak that has been devastating these animal populations for about 10 years and is spreading along a north-west/south-east axis (Walsh et al. 2005). However, the identification of multiple strains during the 2001\u20132005 Gabon/RC outbreaks, the diversity of viral sequences found in dead great apes and the recent identification of two phylogenetically divergent lineages suggest independent introductions into great ape and human populations following multiple viral spillovers from a reservoir host (Wittmann et al. 2007). Therefore the great ape outbreaks might be the result of simultaneous, but independent transmission events from the reservoir species. According to this \u201cmulti-emergence\u201d hypothesis, Ebola outbreaks in great apes are not due to the propagation of a single infection from one individual to another, but rather to massive, simultaneous infections by the animal reservoir in particular environmental conditions. Indeed, outbreaks always occur at the same time of the year, during the transition period between the dry and rainy season. Human infection occurs secondarily and is generally linked to the handling of animal corpses. Although the idea of multi-emergence makes no reference to a particular time scale, this theory also implicitly assumes that ZEBOV was present in Equatorial Africa long before the first documented outbreak in 1976, as supported by various serological data. For instance, a serologic survey based on 790 samples collected from about 20 primate species in Cameroon, Gabon, and RC over a 15-year period showed that 12.9 % of wild chimpanzees in these countries have Ebola virus-specific IgGs (Leroy et al. 2004b) and that some positive samples largely predated the first human outbreaks in these regions. The results suggest that (i) these animals are in regular contact with the Ebola virus reservoir, (ii) some of them survive the infection, and (iii) Ebola virus has probably been present for a very long time in the forest region of Central African. Ebola virus-specific antibodies were also found in other monkey species (five drills, one baboon, one mandrill and one Cercopithecus monkey), suggesting that the Ebola virus circulation may be very complex, involving far more than the simple direct passage from the reservoir to gorillas and chimpanzees.",

            "text": "\nThe old family affair with lentiviruses (see for review: Locatelli and Peeters 2012; Sharp and Hahn 2011). Lentiviruses of the Retroviridae family infect many mammalian species, including bovines, horses, felines, goats, sheep, and primates. The great majority of lentiviruses are exogenous (i.e., transmitted horizontally), but they can also be integrated in the host genome (one of the main characteristics of retroviruses) and transmitted vertically through the germline, as reported in rabbits (RELIK) and lemurs (pSIV), in which the lentivirus became endogenous about 12 and 4 million years ago, respectively (Katzourakis et al. 2007; Gifford et al. 2008; Sharp and Hahn 2011). As stated by Sharp and Hahn (2011) and from the estimated phylogenetic tree by Guindon and Gascuel (2003), such embedded viruses can be considered as \u201cviral fossils\u201d that demonstrate the ancient origin of retroviral infections in vertebrates and provide a direct evidence of the long coevolution of lentiviruses with their hosts. Indeed, although molecular clock calculations based on Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) genomic sequences suggest that ancestral SIVs originated only few hundred years ago, the timescale of their evolution appears to be much longer (Holmes 2003). For instance, a study on SIV on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, established that SIV is at least 32,000-year/old (Worobey et al. 2010). Although intraspecific transmission occurs more frequently, interspecific transmissions (i.e., crossing the barrier species) happen as well and they favor two types of SIV evolution: a long-term one, and a more recent diversification, possibly associated with recombination events between different lentiviruses (Souquiere et al. 2001). During both types of evolution, SIV might have jumped the species barrier between humans and NHPs.",

This distribution suggests that adaptation to humans has occurred several times independently during the genus history.

The diversity of Laverania species infecting great apes in Africa was described for the first time at the beginning of the twentieth century (Coatney et al. 1971). At that time, it was considered that only one sister lineage of P. falciparum existed: P. reichenowi, a chimpanzee parasite. This notion persisted until the very recent development of non-invasive methods (Prugnolle et al. 2010) and the use of molecular tools that allowed a complete reevaluation of the species diversity of African ape Plasmodium parasites (Kaiser et al. 2010; Ollomo et al. 2009; Rich et al. 2009; Duval et al. 2010; Krief et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2010; Prugnolle et al. 2010). This led to the discovery that great apes in Africa are the hosts of a much larger number of Laverania species than previously thought. In particular, these studies identified parasites that are very closely related to P. falciparum and that infect only gorillas among all the wild populations of great apes (Liu et al. 2010; Prugnolle et al. 2010). Other P. falciparum-like parasites were also identified in captive chimpanzees (Duval et al. 2010) and bonobos (Krief et al. 2010), but it was rapidly demonstrated that these parasites resulted from human-to-primate direct transfers.",

Several examples of transfer from primates to humans or vice versa are now well documented. The case of P. knowlesi is certainly the clearest. It was considered to be exclusively a parasite of Asian macaques until it was recently identified as the cause of almost 70 % of human cases of malaria in some areas of South-East Asia. It is now considered to be the \u201cfifth human malaria parasite\u201d (White 2008). It is still unclear whether P. knowlesi infections are only due to primate-to-human CST or whether human-to-human transmission may occur as well; however, since 2004, reports on the incidence of this parasite among humans in various countries in South East Asia have been increasing. P. vivax has a similar history, but possibly much older. This parasite belongs to a group of Plasmodium species that infect monkeys in Asia (see Fig. 1) and it might have emerged in humans following a transfer from macaques (Mu et al. 2005). Some South American Plasmodium species that infect New World monkeys are also very closely related to human Plasmodium parasites. For instance, P. simium is very close genetically to P. vivax and the closest relative of P. brasilianum is P. malariae (Tazi and Ayala 2010). If the hypothesis of an Asian origin of P. vivax is true, the close phylogenetic relationship of P. simium with P. vivax could be interpreted as the result of an anthroponosis (i.e., host switching from humans to other animals). Concerning P. brasilianum, while its close relationship with P. malariae is suggestive of a host switch, the question of whether platyrrhines acquired it from or transferred it to humans remains unanswered (Tazi and Ayala 2010).",
