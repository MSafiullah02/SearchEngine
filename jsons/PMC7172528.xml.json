Using this selection criterion increased the probability of the children having an RTI during the study period. Exclusion criteria were verified using questionnaires completed by both the GPs and the parents and included chronic asthma or recurrent wheezing (for longer than 3 months) treated with corticosteroids; other disorders predisposing to recurrent RTIs, such as Down syndrome and cleft palate; and clinically significant hypersensitivity to eggs. Children with previous serious adverse reactions to vaccines also were excluded, as were children who previously received influenza, pneumococcal, or hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccinations and those with conditions for which these vaccinations are already recommended, such as chronic cardiac and respiratory conditions. The Medical Ethical Review Board of the University Medical Center Utrecht approved the study protocol. Parents were told about the study by their GP, and written informed consent was obtained from both parents or legal guardian of each child before study enrollment.",
