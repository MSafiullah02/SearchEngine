In particular, the data on diet and lifestyle of Seventh-Day Adventists are dissected in detail and compared to non-Adventist populations.",

            "text": "The conclusions they reach are that the components of a Californian Seventh-Day Adventist vegetarian lifestyle including diet, exercise pattern, tobacco and alcohol use, and philosophical and religious beliefs together promote an increase in longevity. For men who live to the age of 30 years, life expectancy is 7\u00b728 years longer than for the general population; for women the figure is 4\u00b742 years longer. A modest effect was also found in an Oxford study of UK vegetarians, which found that they lived longer than non-vegetarians\u2014although the results were possibly related to excess mortality in the non-vegetarians in the first 5 years of the study.",

            "text": "The benefits of vegetarianism seem to be most apparent for coronary heart disease (CHD), with significant reductions seen in both Adventist and non-Adventist vegetarians by comparison with the general population. This result comes as no surprise in view of the success of vegetarian diets in CHD regression studies, and the sanctioning of CHD risk-reduction health claims by the US Food and Drug Administration for components of the diet that reduce serum cholesterol (eg, \u03b2-glucan from oats, soy protein, plant sterols, and nuts). Total cancer mortality is also lower in both Adventists and non-Adventist vegetarians than in the general population\u2014largely because of a reduction in the rate of lung cancer. Furthermore, vegetarians are thinner than non-vegetarians and are at a reduced risk of developing diabetes.",

            "text": "The authors are careful not to select one aspect of vegetarianism to account for all these health benefits. For example, the dose-response benefits for all-cause mortality of exercise and nut consumption, both known to confer metabolic benefits, are contrasted with the increased risk from meat and doughnut consumption. In such ways, the authors use the Adventist study to illustrate the complex differences in diet and lifestyle between vegetarians and non-vegetarians\u2014ie, meat consumption is only one issue. Indeed, it is somewhat surprising that the progression in health from heavy meat eater, through moderate meat consumption to lacto-vegetarian and on to vegan (no animal products consumed) is not clear cut, since, disappointingly, the vegans, possibly because few were included in the Adventist study, do not achieve a clear advantage in terms of longevity over lacto-vegetarians.",

Many will see it as being even more appropriate in an age in which intensive animal husbandry has brought us bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), lethal antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli infections, avian influenza with the possibility of porcine transmission, and an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome from civet cats kept in cramped conditions for human consumption. Yet Gary Fraser and his colleagues stick rigorously to the science relating to the vegetarian diet. Only in the powerful introductory quotation from William Roberts, editor of the American Journal of Cardiology, is there a hint that there are both health and humanitarian reasons for being a vegetarian.",
