The patient succumbed to renal failure 18 days after the procedure. There were many subsequent attempts, but it was not until 1983 at the University of Toronto that Dr. Joel Cooper performed the first successful long-term lung transplant. Dr. Denton Cooley attempted the first heart-lung transplantation in a child in 1968. The patient was a 2 month old with pulmonary hypertension and a complete AV canal, but they only survived for 14 hours. The first successful isolated lung transplant in a child was performed at the University of Toronto in 1987 in a 16 year old boy with pulmonary fibrosis. The 1990s witnessed a rapid growth in the number of pediatric lung transplants performed annually. However, unlike lung transplantation in adults, that growth has not continued in the 2000s. At present, there are approximately 100 lung transplants done worldwide per year in children.",

The indications in childhood vary by age. Pulmonary hypertension, secondary to congenital heart disease or other pulmonary vascular disorders, is the leading indication in infancy followed by interstitial lung disease, including surfactant protein abnormalities. For older children and adolescents cystic fibrosis (CF) accounts for half to three quarters of all lung transplant procedures. Although the most common diagnoses for children receiving lung transplants are listed in Table 74 .1 determining which children may benefit from lung transplantation is often not as straightforward. In addition, determining the appropriate time to proceed is often challenging. Transplant physicians thoughtfully gage when a patient has entered the transplant window. This is the point in time where the patient is sick enough to warrant lung transplantation but not so sick that the odds of a good outcome have markedly deteriorated. Multiple variables must be carefully considered including the trajectory of the underlying disease. Lung transplantation is a procedure of last resort and, when performed, should provide the patient with not only an improved likelihood of survival over their underlying disease but also an improvement in their quality of life. Lung transplantation is a lifelong commitment to a complex and demanding regimen that includes daily immunosuppressive therapy, frequent physician visits, routine surveillance procedures, including bronchoscopy, transbronchial biopsy, radiographic examinations, and blood work. Therefore, the pediatric patient must have adequate family support and access to transplant services and medications as well as demonstrate a willingness and ability to adhere to this admittedly complex regimen.",

Lung transplantation is the only intervention with the potential to sustain life. Surfactant protein C deficiency has a more variable presentation and is inherited in autosomal dominant pattern. The age of disease onset spans from the newborn period to adulthood. In addition, even infants presenting with more severe findings such as respiratory failure can improve over time. This variability suggests that other genetic or environmental modifiers may influence the course.

The typical approach is a bilateral sequential procedure with a transsternal bilateral anterior thoracotomy, referred to as the clamshell incision, which provides excellent access and visualization for the procedure. At our center, an end-to-end anastomosis is favored for the airway because of the higher incidence of stenosis seen with a telescopic anastomosis. Many centers will cover the anastomosis with peribronchial lymphatic tissue. It is important to note that the bronchial circulation, lymphatic system, and nervous system are not reanastomosed. However, a few centers do advocate direct bronchial revascularization. If a cardiac repair is necessary, it is done after the pneumonectomies but prior to implantation as this provides the surgeon with a bloodless operative field. After the second lung has been implanted, they are inflated to expand all of the atelectatic portions. The patient is then weaned off of bypass. Two chest tubes are left in each pleural space. The pulmonary veins can be assessed at this time with transesophageal echocardiography, and the pulmonary artery anastomoses can be evaluated upon arrival to cardiac intensive care unit with a perfusion scan.",

About half of the lung transplant centers throughout the world use induction in the hopes of preventing early acute rejection. There is also a great deal of variability in the induction regimen of choice. Some centers will utilize an interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antagonist such as basiliximab. Other centers will use a lympholytic agent such as rabbit antithymocyte globulin (RATG) or equine antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM). These preparations are derived from animal serum and contain antibodies to human lymphocytes that can induce opsonization and phagocytosis of T lymphocytes, modulating their activation. Because of the relative high frequency of acute rejection among lung transplant recipients, a maintenance strategy of triple drug immunosuppression is commonly employed (Table 74 .4). The three drugs will typically consist of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), a cell cycle toxin inhibitor, and systemic corticosteroids. In pediatrics especially, we attempt to minimize steroid exposure, and during the first post-transplant year we wean the steroid dose from 0.5 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/ kg; at our center it typically remains at that dose.",

The most common form of PTLD is caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection causing transformation of a CD20 cell, resulting in a B-cell lymphoma, most commonly polymorphic. Patients who develop primary EBV infection post-transplant are at greatest risk. For CD20 positive PTLD, anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) therapy has revolutionized the management and allows successful treatment when combined with regimens of low-dose chemotherapy and reduced baseline immunosuppression. This approach causes far less toxicity than prior treatment options. Prognosis is substantially worse for CD20-negative PTLD, due to a combination of a lack of good therapeutic options and the toxicity of the available regimens. Overall, per the ISHLT registry (1/1992-6/2012), PTLD caused 3.3% of deaths in pediatric lung recipients, with other malignancies causing 0.8% of deaths. The major challenge in PTLD is diagnosis, as it can present with anything from asymptomatic pulmonary nodules on CT scan, neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms, bone pain, or sinus pain. Further, although peak incidence is at 6 months post-transplant, it can be seen as a late complication as well. Thus, careful evaluation and assessment, including biopsies and imaging, are needed to make the diagnosis.",

Patients with cystic fibrosis continue to be at risk for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome and must continue to take pancreatic enzyme supplements, along with bowel regimens (i.e., lactulose or Miralax), particularly in the early post-operative period to avoid obstruction. Gastroesophageal reflux deserves special mention, as data suggest that diagnosis and treatment of GER with antireflux surgery may prevent the development of bronchiolitis obliterans and ameliorate its progression if present, but these data have not been replicated in children. As mentioned above, PTLD can present as intussusception, obstruction, bowel perforation, feeding intolerance or abdominal pain. For GI complications, medical management for resolution is preferred.

The diagnosis requires both symptoms and neuroimaging findings, with MRI being superior to CT scan for identifying PRES. Consultation with a neurologist is also recommended; however, long-term medication is not generally needed for seizures related to lung transplantation. Hypertension can be present and contributory, and should be managed accordingly.

In this procedure, marginal donor lungs that are not accepted for transplant initially are ventilated and perfused ex vivo and allowed to recover. Lungs have been successfully transplanted this way, and expanding the donor pool provides the opportunity to save patients that still, at present, die waiting for organs. This procedure needs to be extended into children as soon as possible. Another such area is the use of pumpless oxygenators as a bridge to lung transplantation. In conventional ECMO, a pump takes blood from the patient, into the oxygenator then returns it. Recently, pumpless oxygenator systems have been used in candidates awaiting lung transplantation (i.e., NovaLung). While pediatric specific systems are still being developed, we have used a neonatal membrane oxygenator (Quadrox) to successfully bridge an infant suffering from alveolar capillary dysplasia to transplant. Both pumpless oxygenators and venovenous ECMO are being increasingly used as ways to less invasively bridge candidates to transplant for longer periods of time than conventional ECMO, which requires significant sedation, mechanical ventilation, and immobility, which while buying some time, also leads to progression of the primary lung disease, all of which limit the time a candidate can be bridged on conventional ECMO. Last, an array of anti-cytokine therapeutic antibodies being developed for other therapeutic indications (i.e., anti-IL-13, anti-IL-5R, anti-IL-17, and others) provide an opportunity to manipulate these mediators, all seen in different forms and stages of lung transplant rejection, in order to treat or prevent rejection, and potentially to promote engraftment.",

Concerns include the development of malignancy post-transplant as well as the potential for increased risk for a poor peri-operative outcome. 8.MalignancyIdeal donor No cancer history Evidence Little data, particularly in donors with a past history of a malignancy. The potential risk is likely based on histology, tumor stage, and length of cancer free survival. Primary CNS tumors rarely spread. Risk factors include medulloblastoma or glioblastoma, previous craniotomy, venticular shunt, tumor radiation. Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer that is transmitted from a donor. 9. Length of mechanical ventilation Ideal donor Ventilated for less than 3 days Evidence Greater than 2 days of mechanical ventilation is a risk factor for the development of ventilator associated pneumonia. However, donors with prolonged courses and clear X-rays and good gas exchange may in fact be better donors since the sequelae of aspiration may not be evident within the first 24-48 hours. 10.
