Several models were considered based on the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation graphs. Based on the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Root Mean Squared Error, ARIMA(1,1,1)\u00d7(1,0,1) 12 was identified to be the better model among the others with an AIC value of \u2212414.51 and RMSE of 47884.85. Moreover, it is expected that the industry will have an estimated earning loss of around P 170.5 billion pesos if the COVID-19 crisis will continue up to July. Possible recommendations to mitigate the problem includes stopping foreign tourism but allowing regions for domestic travels if the regions are confirmed to have no cases of COVID-19, assuming that every regions will follow the stringent guidelines to eliminate or prevent transmissions; or extending this to countries with no COVID-19 cases.",

R includes linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification modeling, clustering, etc. The 'forecast' package [7] was utilized to generate time series plots, autocorrelation function/partial autocorrelation function plots, and forecasting. Also, the 'tseries' package [10] was used to perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) to test stationarity. Moreover, the 'lmtest' package [11] was used to test the parameters of the SARIMA model. Finally, the 'ggplot2' [12] , 'tidyr' [13] , and 'dplyr' [14] were used to plot time series data considered during the conduct of the research. Line plot was used to describe the behavior of the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines. Figure 1 shows that there is an increasing trend and a seasonality pattern in the time series. Specifically, there is a seasonal increase in monthly foreign visitor arrivals every December and a seasonal decrease every September. These patterns suggest a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) approach in modeling and forecasting the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines. Akaike Information Criterion and Root Mean Squared Error were used to identify which model was used to model and forecast the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines. Table 1 shows the top two SARIMA models based on AIC generated using R. ARIMA (1,1,1)\u00d7(1,0,1) 12 has the lowest AIC with a value of \u2212414.56 which is followed by ARIMA (1,1,1)\u00d7(1,0,1) 12 with an AIC value of \u2212414.51. Model estimation was performed on both models and generated significant parameters for both models (refer to Appendix A.2). Moreover, diagnostic checking was performed to assess the model. Both models passed the checks using residual versus time plot, residual versus fitted plot, normal Q-Q plot, ACF graph, PACF graphs, Ljung-Box test, and Shapiro-Wilk test (refer to Appendix A.3). Finally, forecast evaluation was performed to measure the accuracy of the model using an out-of-sample data set (refer to Appendix A.4). ARIMA (1,1,1)\u00d7(1,0,1) 12 produced the lowest RMSE relative to ARIMA (0,1,2)\u00d7(1,0,1) 12 . Hence, the former was used to forecast the monthly foreign visitor arrivals in the Philippines.",

This is supported by the ACF and PACF plots which shows a slow decay in all the lags of the former and the the first lag is significant for the latter. Moreover, the line plot slightly display an increasing variance across time. Therefore, data transformation such as differencing and Box-Cox transform were applied to the time series data. Figure 4 show the line, ACF, and PACF graph of the transformed data. The line graph shows that the data is stationary which is supported by both ACF and PACF graphs. Moreover, ACF graph suggests a seasonal pattern in the data since 12 th , 24 th , 36 th , 48 th , and 60 th lags are significant.

Therefore, this scatter plot suggests that the residuals has no serial correlation, that is, there is no interdependence between time and residuals. This is supported by Ljung-Box test which suggests that the error terms behave randomly for both Model 1 (Q(20) = 20.109, df=20, Model df=4, p= 0.4511) and Model 2 (Q(20) = 20.941, df=20, Model df=4, p= 0.4006). In addition, the residuals versus fitted values scatter plot displays no visible funneling pattern which indicates that the variances of the error term are relatively equal. Moreover, the normal Q-Q plot suggests that the residuals are normally distributed since most of the the values lie along a line. This is supported by Shapiro-Wilk test which suggest that the error is normally distributed for both Model 1 (W= 0.98062, p= 0.2372) and Model 2 (W= 0.9852, p= 0.4513).
