The entire itinerary for the trip should be reviewed, including destinations, time and duration of travel, types of accommodation, activities, and potential exposure to insects and animals. The evaluation also should review the medical and immunization history of the child to ensure that appropriate advice is given regarding preventive measures, including necessary vaccines. This evaluation can be accomplished by providing a form for parents to complete and bring to the initial pretravel assessment visit. Particular attention should be given to children of immigrants who are returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives (VFR) because these children have been shown to be at increased risk for many infectious diseases.1, 5, 6 Many excellent resources, most of which are accessible online, provide pretravel advice for pediatricians (Box 8.1\n).Box 8.1Resources and Additional Information for Travelers\n\u2022World Health Organization (WHO).

Skin protection is an important topic and includes both the risk of serious sunburn and the avoidance of infectious diseases. For sunblock, 30 is the minimum sun protection factor (SPF) recommended for children. Sunblock should be applied 30 minutes before exposure and always before insect repellent is applied where both are needed. Adolescent travelers should be counseled regarding safer sex practices and risks of body piercing and tattooing in less developed countries. Freshwater exposure of any kind should be avoided in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis or where Leptospira species can contaminate the water. Exposure to infected stool of animals or humans can result in several types of parasitic infection either directly (e.g., hookworm) or through fecal-oral exposure (e.g., Toxocara spp.). Shoes provide more protection than sandals for children exposed to contaminated environments. Animal bites can result in injury, bacterial infection at the site, or rabies; therefore, children should be cautioned to avoid unknown animals while traveling. Because disposable diapers may not be available in some countries, parents should be aware that cloth diapers must be ironed after washing to kill eggs and larvae deposited on clothing by the tumbu fly, the vector of myiasis, in parts of Africa.",

Measles- and varicella-containing vaccines should be deferred from 3 to 11 months after IG administration depending on the indication and dose of IG required (see Chapter 5). Although the effect of IG administration on the immunogenicity of varicella vaccine is unknown, the current recommendation is to use the same guidelines for varicella vaccine and IG as are used for measles-containing vaccines.19 IG administration does not interfere with the immune response to yellow fever vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), rotavirus vaccines, or any inactivated vaccines.

If a vaccinated child is bitten or sustains a skin-penetrating scratch by a potentially rabid animal, the wound must be washed thoroughly, and 2 additional doses must be completed as soon as possible (given 3 days apart); rabies IG is not required.53 Without preexposure immunization, rabies IG and 4 doses of an approved vaccine (given over 14 days) are required; however, rabies IG is often not available in many developing countries.53\n",

In addition, characteristics of the individual traveler, including age, ability to swallow tablets, and any specific contraindications, are relevant.59 Breastfeeding infants require prophylaxis because antimalarial drugs do not reach high enough levels in human milk. Several medications are recommended for prevention of malaria in children: chloroquine, mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone/proguanil.59, 60 Chloroquine is inexpensive and well tolerated, but it is of limited efficacy because of resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in all regions except parts of the Caribbean and Central America. Atovaquone/proguanil is typically the best tolerated, but it is the most expensive. It is approved for children >5 kg and comes as pediatric tablets. Mefloquine is safe for use in pregnancy and neonates and has the convenience of weekly dosing. Adult tablets need to be broken and compounded into a liquid. Neuropsychiatric side effects limit its tolerability, and increasing resistance is reported in Southeast Asia.60 Doxycycline is contraindicated in children <9 years of age because of dental staining. Primaquine is recommended as a primary agent in areas with a high incidence of Plasmodium vivax, such as Central America, and as a second-line agent in other areas when other antimalarial drugs cannot be used (see Chapter 271).61 Chloroquine should be initiated 1 to 2 weeks before travel and preferably 4 weeks before travel for mefloquine; doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, and primaquine can be started 1 day before exposure. Most chemoprophylactic agents must be continued for 4 weeks after departure from malaria-endemic areas except for atovaquone/proguanil and primaquine, which must be continued for only 1 week after exposure. However, in an atovaquone/proguanil prophylaxis study in 485 Israeli subjects, 87% discontinued the drug 1 day after travel; no cases of malaria occurred, suggesting a shorter duration after travel can be adequate.62 Updated guidelines from national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) can be found online (see Box 8.1).",

Given the constantly changing epidemiology of infectious diseases, pediatricians who advise families regarding travel health must keep informed of the current status of emerging infectious diseases that can pose a threat to the traveler. Several websites provide up-to-date information regarding such infections, including those of the WHO and the CDC (see Box 8.1).",

Killed or subunit vaccines can be administered to children with altered immunity, although responses to the vaccines can be diminished.85 Asplenic patients may respond poorly to polysaccharide vaccines in particular. Patients with certain B-lymphocyte deficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency, should avoid OPV, vaccinia, and live bacterial vaccines, although other patients with humoral immunodeficiencies, including selective immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG subclass deficiency, must avoid only OPV; other live vaccines can be considered.",
