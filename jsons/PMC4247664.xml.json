Examples are the influenza viruses - for instance H1N1 in 2009, and H7N9 and H5N1 more recently [1] - the MERS rotavirus in Saudi Arabia [2], and Chikungunya virus in St Martin in 2013 [3], and of course now Ebola virus [4]. So there are many rare but potentially very dangerous diseases or emerging infections regularly breaking out. Ebola virus is by far the most lethal that we have now, but all of the others are very dangerous.",

For Ebola I think that the technology to make a vaccine has been there for many years, but nobody wanted to invest in it because there was no market, no demand.",

I see these emerging infectious diseases as a constant threat. They pose a risk, just as in other areas we have a risk of earthquakes, we have a risk when we drive a car of car accidents, when we buy a house there is a risk of burning the house, and so on - and for all of those risks we prepare ahead of time. We have insurance for cars or we have insurance for houses and we build buildings that are earthquake-resistant. It looks as though the only place where we are not able to make investments ahead of time is health - we always have to wait for the disaster to happen and then we rush and usually with the vaccine we come too late and when the disease is no longer there then everyone forgets and we go from one disaster to another.",

Under very accelerated circumstances, like those we have now for Ebola, you can take advantage of previous studies that have been done and try to rush the development of the vaccine, but we do take risks with safety and efficacy when we accelerate so much, so I think we will be wise to develop those vaccines ahead of time.",

I don\u2019t think that a small exposure to mankind right now is going to do it and the preliminary data from the genetics and genomics of the virus show very good stability so I don\u2019t think this is a risk in the short term.",

It will not be in the news and there will be other news about another emerging infection and we will rush into the new one, and instead of doing that I think it would be nice to be able to plan ahead of time. I think we have technologies today by which we could prepare multiple vaccine platforms that could be tested for safety and efficacy against multiple diseases and where you could plug in an antigen from a new emerging infection quickly. We already effectively have this for influenza virus, for which as the virus mutates each year we just plug in the most prevalent haemagglutinin variants to the existing vaccine platform. If the regulatory authorities could approve platforms suitable for use against other pathogens \u2013 thus already of proven safety and efficacy \u2013 we could have a way of being as ready as possible for unexpected events.",
