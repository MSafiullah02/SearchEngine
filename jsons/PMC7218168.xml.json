It is currently a global public health threat and more than 100 countries including Italy, Iran, the United States, South Korea, and Japan are suffering from COVID-19. Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. As of April 02, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy reached 115,242, ranking second in the world, with the total confirmed deaths at 13,915, which has become one of the highest among the major epidemic countries. However, few studies have assessed the epidemic status in Italy (4, 5).",

China has taken precise and differentiated strategies, including self-quarantine of residents in Wuhan and other areas and community-based prevention and control. These measures have played an important role in preventing and controlling the epidemic. Previous studies have shown that due to the isolation of Wuhan, the overall epidemiological progress in mainland China has been delayed by 3\u20135 days and the number of internationally transmitted cases has been reduced by nearly 80% (6). Italy detected the first two cases of imported COVID-19 on Jan 31. After that, Italy was the first country to declare a state of emergency. Since then, various measures have been implemented to control the spread of COVID-19. It is vital to evaluate the role of Italian quarantine measures for decision-making.",

The SIR model and its modifications such as SEIR model have been widely applied to the current outbreak of COVID-19. Tang et al. estimated the infectivity of COVID-19 based on a classical susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemiological model (7). Wu et al. proposed an extended SEIR model to forecast the spread of 2019-nCoV both within and outside of mainland China (3). However, these studies assumed that the exposed population were not infectious, which may be not suitable in COVID-19. Yang Z et al. predicted that China's epidemic will peak in late February and end in late April by a combination of SEIR model and a machine-learning artificial intelligence (AI) approach (8). However, this study and the above studies did not consider the phase-adjusted preventive measures and time-varying parameters, which may affect the accuracy of predictions.",

The spread of COVID-19 in Hunan Province appeared relatively early and has now entered a phase of no infections, which helps to observe the entire course of the epidemic. Due to the similarity of population size and geographical location adjacent to Hubei, Hunan's public health measures can provide useful guidance for Italy in preventing the further spread of COVID-19.",

In previous studies, estimation of the epidemic of an infectious disease is often performed using constant parameters (15\u201318). The advantage of the eSIR model is that it combines time-varying isolation measures and expands the SIR model to adapt to the time-varying transmission rate in the population. Lili Wang et al. found that COVID-19 outside Hubei in China has been, so far, much less severe (9). But they did not perform each province's analyses. The first and second points in our study are, respectively, Feb 04 and Feb 09,which are the same as these outside Hubei in China. Furthermore, the actual number of infected cases (1,018) is included in the predicted number of infected cases (840\u20138 013) and the endpoint (Mar 14) is included in the predicted endpoint (Feb 29 to Mar 28) in our study, which also reflects the stability and accuracy of the eSIR model. Combining the above data and methods, these findings show that the eSIR model is more suitable for predicting the epidemic trend of COVID-19.",

Cosimo Distante et al. found that many regions in Italy reach an R0 value of up to 4, some even reaching 5.07 (23), which is similar to our study. This needs to be confirmed by further studies. It is worth pointing out that the estimation R0 in the eSIR model is larger than those in the SIR model. This is because the estimation R0 in the eSIR model is adjusted according to the effect of intervention.",

Possible reasons for such rapid growth of infections include: (1) more timely caution and preventative measures were not taken, and (2) the number of infections during Jan 31-Feb 20 could be under-reported due to underdiagnosis, given subclinical or asymptomatic cases. The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to be within 14 days following exposure, with most cases occurring ~4\u20135 days after exposure (19, 24, 25). So it seems impossible to for there to have been a total of only two or three cases during Jan 31-Feb 20 in Italy. In addition, the rapid increase in the number of infections after Feb 21 might reflect a belated realization of the spread of COVID-19.",

In our study, compared with no intervention in the SIR model (Figures S1, S2), rigorous government control policies in Hunan and Italy dramatically decreased the number of COVID-19 cases. Based on our model, Italy should still maintain all levels of quarantines as China did by Aug 05 (95%CI: May 30 to Inf). Furthermore, Tianyi Qiu et al. found that delaying the lockdown by 1\u20136 days in Wuhan would expand the infection scale 1.23\u20134.94 times and the epidemic would be out of control if lockdown had been imposed 7 days later (18). Our study also shows that taking government control earlier can decrease the number of infected cases by comparing the epidemic trend in Hunan and Italy. In addition, from China's experience, various control measures, including the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, traffic restrictions, medical tracking, and entry or exit screening, can well-prevent the further spread of COVID-19. These measures are in line with the latest recommendations by the World Health Organization and a previous study in Spain (30). But the most effective strategy still needs to be confirmed by further studies. Consequently, it is better and necessary to apply strict public health measures in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases.",
