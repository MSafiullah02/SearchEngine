The COVID-19 epidemic then spread rapidly throughout China and the world. The front-line healthcare workers needed to use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, goggles, and protective clothing for long periods of time. However, PPE may cause a series of skin problems due to long-term sealing, friction, and pressure. The present review details the characteristics of skin damage caused by several main pieces of PPE, and the corresponding prevention and care measures required based on the experience of the first-line clinicians working to treat 2019-nCoV infection.",

Such equipment needs to be tightly attached to the skin surface, which compresses the skin at the fixed site for many hours and may result in device-related pressure injuries. 4, 5 The factors contributing to device-related pressure injuries include poor local blood circulation, tissue ischemia and hypoxia, skin evaporation, and the accumulation on the inside of the mask of a large amount of water vapor exhaled from the mouth and nose, keeping the facial skin in a moist environment for a long period; this softens and impregnates the skin, and reduces the ability of the stratum corneum to resist external pressure and shear forces. Thus, the skin is prone to indentations. 6, 7 In addition, the friction between the PPE and the skin enhances the development of erythema, blisters, or ulcers, along with pain and even secondary infection (Fig. 1 ).",

Due to the poor permeability of hair, hats, and helmets, the sweat and oil secreted by the scalp mix together and remain on the skin surface of the head, consequently blocking the pores and making it easier for folliculitis to develop when bacteria colonize. Aggravation of this inflammation may lead to skin lesions such as pustules, boils, seborrheic dermatitis, and secondary fungal infection. ",

Furthermore, the hot and humid environment is conducive to fungal reproduction and tinea of the feet and hands. In addition to wearing gloves, hand hygiene is also essential for chemical and biological protection. Repeated washing damages the skin barrier and is partially accountable for dryness, itching, and eczema of the hands and feet. Furthermore, repeated contact with irritants such as disinfectants and gloves can cause contact dermatitis with erythema, pimples, pimples, exudation, or erosion. One study found that 52% of medical staff with hand eczema wash their hands more than 10 times per day. 10 Long-term disinfectant use also influences the microbiota and changes the immune microenvironment on the skin surface, resulting in conditions such as eczema, fungal infection, bacterial infection, and allergic dermatitis. 11",

            "text": "Many types of hydrogel dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, and foam dressings are used in clinical practice to prevent stress injuries. Hydrogel has a rich water content and three-dimensional network structure, and has many characteristics that are beneficial to wound healing. Hydrogel dressings have good biocompatibility and compliance, as the porous structure guarantees breathability and absorbs and releases moisture to ensure that the skin moisture content is appropriate. Hydrogel also has cooling and analgesic effects. The hydrocolloid dressing also has good compliance and can be fitted to the skin of irregularly shaped body parts with minimal effect on the tightness of PPE. 13 The application of hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings to the skin that is under pressure reduces the maximum pressure caused by the device, avoids friction between the device and the skin, and largely prevents pressure injuries 14 ( Fig. 2A-D) . The position of the PPE must be adjusted to ensure the tightness (Fig. 2E ). In addition, hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings have selfadhesive properties, are easy to apply, and do not damage the skin during dressing removal 15, 16 (Fig. 2F) . Foam dressing is a decompression dressing that is often used clinically to prevent pressure ulcers. Foam dressing is very protective against pressure and shear force, and has a good liquid absorption capacity. 17 However, the thickness and material characteristics of foam dressing means that its compliance is not as good as that of hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings, and care must be taken not to affect the tightness of the PPE during use. In addition, continuous compression and prolonged exposure to a humid environment increase the risk of pressure-related injuries. Workers should remove PPE as soon as possible after leaving the working environment, as this is conducive to skin self-repair.",

An appropriate cleaning frequency removes dirt, bacteria, and some sweat and oil from the skin surface, which reduces the irritation caused by their long-term presence and reduces the risk of infection. Adequate moisturizing helps maintain the moisture content of the corneum, maintains the \"brick-wall\" structure of the epidermis, and facilitates cell self-repair. 18 Basic moisturizing usually consists of two categories: the application of a water-soluble moisturizer (including glycerin and sodium hyaluronate) that supplements natural moisturizing factors to lock in moisture, 19 and the application of squalane, mineral oils, and various natural oils to replenish sebum, which forms an oil film on the skin surface to prevent water loss. People with rich sebum in a closed equipment environment should use water-soluble moisturizers to prevent excessive oil from blocking the pores and causing acne.",

For small sterile blisters, the epidermis is kept intact, and the blister fluid will be absorbed without intervention. For blisters with a large area or high tension, a sterile syringe is used to suction out the fluid from the bottom of the blister, topical antibiotic ointment is applied, and epidermal loss should be avoided. If there is erosion and exudation, the wound is washed with physiological saline after disinfection. Antibiotic ointment is required for infection prevention. Moreover, a suitable dressing is selected in accordance with the exudate. If there is a lot of exudate, an alginate dressing or foam dressing with good absorptivity is used. The hydrocolloid dressing is suitable for a medium amount of exudate, while a hydrogel dressing or a film dressing is suitable for wounds with less exudate or dry wounds. If ulcers appear on the skin, a wet dressing is also required to promote wound convergence. Silver ion dressings that resist bacteria and reduce the secondary damage caused by frequent dressing replacements are appropriate for infected ulcers. In addition, epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor can be used to promote cell proliferation and accelerate wound healing. Debridement may be needed for deep and chronic ulcers. 20",

Apart from wearing appropriate PPE and avoiding prolonged use, general treatments include: proper skin cleansing, a reasonable selection of skincare products (mainly watersoluble moisturizers and no hormones), a low-sugar diet, and avoidance of squeezing pimples with the hands. Topical choices include retinoids (to regulate keratinization of the epithelium), benzoyl peroxide (to kill P. acnes), and salicylic acid (to dissolve acne and reduce inflammation), as well as erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol tincture, and other antibiotic preparations. When these topical treatments do not achieve a good effect, a combination of red and blue light treatment should be applied.
