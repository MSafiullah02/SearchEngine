It was of particular interest to investigate the accuracy and clinical application with regard to diagnosis of lymphoma, as anecdotal opinion at this referral institution considered aqueocentesis to be useful in identifying lymphoma, yet previous studies have only sparsely documented this in canine patients and, for feline patients, it is not yet validated.",

Cases were then included in the study if aqueocentesis had been performed during the diagnostic investigation of anterior uveitis and excluded if performed solely as part of treatment (i.e., to reduce intraocular pressure postphacoemulsification, when samples were typically not retained). A second search was performed using the database at Powell Torrance Diagnostic Services (PTDS), the on\u2010site laboratory responsible for handling and analyzing all DVS aqueous samples from 2008 onwards, to ensure correlation and inclusion of all cases. Signalment (species, breed, age, neuter status), presenting complaint and history provided by owner and referring veterinary surgeon, any prior medications, and the hospital service to which the patient presented were documented by a clinical record search of these cases. Ophthalmological examination was performed in all cases by an ECVO board\u2010certified ophthalmologist or resident\u2010in\u2010training, prior to performing aqueocentesis. In all patients, this included slit\u2010lamp biomicroscopy with diffuse and focal light beam (Kowa SL\u201015; Kowa Optimed Europe Ltd, Sandhurst, UK or Keeler PSL Classic; Keeler Ltd, Windsor, UK), indirect ophthalmoscopy (Keeler Vantage Plus; Keeler Ltd), often supplemented by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keeler Professional direct ophthalmoscope; Keeler Ltd). Rebound tonometry (Tonovet; Icare, TOWN, Helsinki, Finland) was performed preferentially in all cases from 2011 onwards and applanation tonometry (Tono\u2010Pen Vet; Reichert, Buffalo, New York, USA) prior to this. Ancillary testing such as gonioscopy or fluorescein staining was performed in selected cases where determined appropriate by the attending ophthalmologist. As a prerequisite for performing aqueocentesis, all cases exhibited anterior uveitis, typically established by noting aqueous flare, subjectively assessed by the ophthalmologist on a semiquantitative scale. As no quantitative scale is recognized universally and it is not possible to eliminate inherent subjectivity, this was not incorporated into any further analysis. The presence of hyphema, hypopyon, fibrin, lipemic aqueous, anterior uveal mass, concurrent ocular hypertension/glaucoma, and specific intraocular pressure was noted. General physical examination was performed in all cases by either the attending ophthalmologist or an internal medicine specialist, and all clinically relevant findings recorded.",

The aqueous cytopathology was confidently interpreted as lymphoma in four (Fig. 1), considered probable in a fifth, and in one case, a broader categorization of discrete cell neoplasia was assigned. In 4/6 of these cases with diagnostic or suggestive cytopathologic findings, lymphoma was subsequently confirmed by diagnostic imaging with supportive infiltrative visceral findings, plus either positive peripheral or abdominal lymph node cytopathologic findings or bone marrow biopsy histopathological findings. In 1/6 of these cases, the diagnosis of lymphoma was made solely upon aqueous cytopathology and diagnostic imaging, clinical progression and ultimately euthanasia (autopsy not performed and lymph node cytopathology was nondiagnostic). In the remaining case of these 6 (the discrete cell neoplasia case), the diagnosis of B\u2010cell lymphoma was made by ocular histopathology and immunohistochemistry following enucleation. This was the only case which demonstrated neither clinical signs of systemic disease nor supportive findings on imaging, abdominal viscera aspirates/bone marrow biopsy; however, some of the nonocular sampling was performed 2 days post a short course of therapy with prednisolone. Chemotherapy was declined, and there was no clinical indication of recurrence of lymphoma in a period of >2 years, suggesting a diagnosis of solitary ocular lymphoma.",

Similarly, none of the ten cats sampled by Wiggans et al. had either an aqueous or final diagnosis of lymphoma. However, aqueocentesis was only performed by Wiggans in cases where initial investigations, including blood testing and diagnostic imaging, failed to provide etiology. Our selection criteria differed, with aqueocentesis performed routinely as part of initial investigations and under the same sedation/anesthetic required for concurrent diagnostic imaging; a total of roughly four times the number of cats and dogs of either the Olin or Wiggans studies are included.

Two feline samples in this study were interpreted as \u2018possible\u2019 lymphoma, one of which had blood testing performed solely and the other having thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. However, in neither did clinical progression support a diagnosis of lymphoma. PARR analysis of clonality would have provided a useful adjunct in these cases, to reduce the inherent subjectivity on both the part of the attending ophthalmologist and pathologist. While morphological features on cytopathology may differentiate a polyclonal lymphoid proliferation from a neoplastic, monoclonal one, assessment and demonstration of clonality by molecular genetic analysis of rearranged antigen receptor genes has been developed to provide a more objective identification of lymphoid neoplasia.10, 11 PCR\u2010based tests are readily applicable for aqueous samples as they are rapid, exquisitely sensitive, and applicable to small quantities of DNA, such as the material obtained from aqueocentesis and cyto\u2010centrifuge. Pate reported a single canine B\u2010cell lymphoma case diagnosed using PARR performed on aqueous humor in 2011.12 In our retrospective testing of canine aqueous slides, insufficient cellular material was present in 3/6 samples and was in part attributed to the storage conditions, as these had not been intended for the future PARR analysis. Assessment of clonality is also only usefully interpreted in concert with the morphological and clinical findings and cannot be used solely to diagnose neoplasia although it can clarify an equivocal or possible lymphoma result, that is, a predominantly lymphocytic population may be an atypical inflammatory response or lymphoma. To better assess the validity of performing PARR on aqueous, we are undertaking to more routinely perform this, pending initial cytopathology results, when investigating anterior uveitis.",
