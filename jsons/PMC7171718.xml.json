The laboratory-confirmed surveillance information is available real time publicly through FluNet, the web-based database and reporting system since 1996.20 GISRS provides recommendations on the composition of seasonal influenza virus vaccines biannually and on development of vaccines for zoonotic influenza viruses. This network also provides a global mechanism for maintaining an up-to-date inventory of candidate vaccine viruses and potency reagents for seasonal and zoonotic influenza. The majority of NICs are in Europe and the United States, so there is an absence of information about influenza transmission and the burden of disease is the tropics and the subtropics.",

On March 31, 2013, China notified the WHO of the first recorded human infections with avian H7N9 virus. The poultry markets were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of H7N9 to humans and were quickly closed down in the affected areas. The health authorities collaborated with the WHO in risk assessments and communication, with heightened surveillance in humans and poultry and prompt reporting of new cases. As a result, the infection was contained to China with 139 cases (82% had a history of exposure to live animals, including chickens) and 34% death rate.36\n",

Modeling from Wagner et al based around a single individual infected by H1N1 suggested that in long-haul flights from 7 to 17 people may be infected during the flight.61 Analysis of a group of students suffering inflight exposure to H1N1 found the risk to be approximately 3.5% for those seated within two rows of the index case.42 It is not safe, however, to assume that there is no risk beyond the two-row limit, with one case of SARS leading to infection of 22 of 120 passengers and crew dispersed throughout the aircraft.62\n",

Virtually all pandemic influenza plans were based around an assumption that the vast majority of infected individuals would be febrile, leading to initiatives such as fever clinics and quarantine of febrile patients until a diagnosis was established.41 With H1N1, many infected individuals were not febrile, nor were there any specific clinical characteristics that made it possible to define infected versus noninfected patients. Well after it was recognized by clinicians that fever was often not present with H1N1, public health officials were still discussing establishing fever clinics in Australia. These types of communication breakdowns between clinicians and public health officials are another area that needs to be improved so that the whole process of responding to epidemics is substantially more flexible.65\n",
