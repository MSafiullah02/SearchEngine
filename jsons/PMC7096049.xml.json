            "text": "Inflammation is described as one of the hallmarks of cancer; whereby inflammatory cells and the factors they elaborate have been implicated in nearly every step of tumor development and progression [1]. Neutrophils have been increasingly recognized as important components of the tumor-associated inflammatory cell infiltrate [2\u20135]. Accordingly, their role in tumor biology is being increasingly recognized. In fact, both pro- and antitumorigenic properties have been demonstrated [6, 7]. It is important to note that the term \u201cneutrophil\u201d is a descriptive term based on the histologic appearance of a circulating leukocyte [8]. In clinical practice, the term neutrophil denotes a homogenous population of cells that are mobilized in response to inflammatory stimuli [8]. However, this term does not account for the diversity in cellular functions observed in the laboratory setting. Thus, while circulating neutrophils are morphologically similar under light microscope, it is likely that they can harbor or adopt distinct genetic expression profiles suited to a particular effector mechanism [6, 7, 9]. Along these lines, distinct subsets of \u201cneutrophils\u201d have been described that exert specific and sometimes contradictory roles in tumor development [5\u20137].",

Recent evidence has expanded their biologic scope, with a variety of studies implicating NETs in tumor biology. These range from tumor-associated thrombosis to tumor progression. While these findings are novel, it is important to understand that NETs are complex structures composed of a chromatin decorated in neutrophil-derived peptides, the breadth of which have yet to be fully elucidated. However, many of these proteins have been rigorously studied in the field of cancer progression, albeit in an entirely NET-independent context. In the present review, we will focus on the newly described role of NETs as potential promoters of metastasis. In addition, the contribution of individual NET-associated proteins to tumor progression will be reviewed.",

This has recently been demonstrated in an in vivo model of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice [17]. In the study by McDonald et al., the authors demonstrate that bacterial trapping within the sinusoidal spaces by resident Kupffer cells is unchanged in mice stimulated to produce intravascular NETs versus untreated mice. This was taken to suggest that the receptor-mediated mechanism of leukocyte\u2013pathogen interaction is rapidly overwhelmed in the context of infection. However, NETs provide neutrophils with the ability of interacting with pathogens across a large surface area [17].",

This is thought to be mediated by highly toxic modified histones [15, 17]. In addition, inactivation of bacterial virulence factors has been observed and directly attributed to the action of neutrophil elastase [12].

Additional cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), have been shown to facilitate the process of NET formation. In addition, both of these cytokines are elaborated by a number of primary tumor types [21\u201323].

            "text": "During the process of NET formation, characteristic morphologic changes within neutrophils can be observed [15, 18, 24]. Shortly after stimulation, finger-like projections at the cell membrane can be observed, with subsequent flattening of cells [24]. Chromatin decondensation is a prominent feature of NET formation and is associated with histone modification. Citrullination of histone H3 by peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD 4) is important during the process of NETosis, with its inhibition greatly reducing the efficiency of this process [25, 26]. Following chromatin decondensation, loss of nuclear morphology and loss of the nuclear membrane are observed and are prominent features of NETosis [24]. These are followed by the eventual extrusion of DNA from the cell [24]. This process is dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as evidenced by the fact that patients with chronic granulomatous disease demonstrate reduced NET formation [12, 13, 27]. In addition, activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is essential [28]. Following activation of the appropriate signaling cascades, DNA extrusion ultimately occurs, which requires the translocation of neutrophil elastase (NE) to the nucleus [29]. This process is potentiated by the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) [29, 30]. Neutrophil elastase plays an essential role in the extrusion of neutrophil-derived nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment during NET formation. Following NE inhibition with a neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEi) or serum leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), chromatin decondensation, nuclear degranulation, and consequently neutrophil death and NETosis are disrupted [29].",

However, no studies to date have demonstrated the mechanism(s) underlying these observations. This being said, a tremendous body of literature on the role of specific neutrophil-derived proteins has been published to date. As previously stated, NETs are composed of neutrophil-derived chromatin decorated with antimicrobial proteins and peptides. These include MMP-9, CG and NE whose role in tumor progression has been examined without specific reference to NETs being made. It is important to note that NETs are thought to provide a microenvironment that traps pathogens and brings them into close proximity with antimicrobial peptides, thus favoring their elimination. As a result, it is possible that in the context of malignancy NETs play an analogous role, whereby tumor cells are exposed to a high local concentration of biologically active proteins, favoring interactions that may act to promote proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and support egress from the primary tumor entirely. Accordingly, the literature outlining the contribution of the NET components MMP-9, CG and NE is worth discussing.",

This was associated with decreased keratinocyte proliferation in MMP-9 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT [40]. This phenotype was reversed by transplantation of WT BM cells in MMP-9 \u2212/\u2212 mice following irradiation suggesting that the source for MMP-9 is infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells [40]. This result is further supported by immunohistochemical analysis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which revealed that MMP-9 positivity was restricted to invading granulocytes as opposed to tumor cells themselves [40].

The number of pulmonary metastases observed in this model in MMP null mice was 14 % that of WT mice [38]. Thus, as in the study by Coussens et al., these authors demonstrate that leukocyte-derived MMP-9 supports tumor development [38, 40]. Furthermore, microscopic analysis revealed that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils appeared to be the predominant source of MMP-9 [38]. However, as per Acuff et al. [38], increased lung tumor growth was associated with a significantly lower rate of apoptosis in WT compared to MMP-9 \u2212/\u2212 mice at early stages of tumor development. Following tail vein injection of fluorescently labeled A549 cells, apoptosis within the lungs was quantified. At 6 h post-injection, significantly more tumor cells underwent apoptosis in MMP-9 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice (8 vs. 2 %). By 20 h post-injection the trend had reversed, which the authors attributed to the then insufficient tumor cells in the MMP-9 \u2212/\u2212 mice to match that observed in WT mice [38]. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that neutrophil-derived MMP-9 supports tumor growth in part through preventing apoptosis [38].",

In a study by Van Coillie et al. [43], transgenic murine melanomas overexpressing granulocyte chemotactic peptide 2 (GCP-2), a potent murine neutrophil-attracting chemokine, were generated and injected into nude mice. Compared to wild-type tumors, GCP-2 overexpressing tumors demonstrated increased growth, with significantly higher tumor volumes exhibited at 8 weeks following subcutaneous administration [43]. Conversely, no difference in growth was observed in vitro between transgenic and WT tumors [43]. This finding suggests that enhanced tumor growth in transgenic tumors is the result of interactions with host-derived cells [43]. Accordingly, immunohistochemical analysis of excised GCP-2 overexpressing tumors revealed well-developed vascular networks when compared with their WT counterparts [43]. Furthermore, transgenic tumors exhibited extensive infiltration with cells staining positive for MPO, which were interpreted as neutrophils [43]. This neutrophil infiltrate was associated with significantly increased levels of intra-tumoral MMP-9 when compared with WT tumors [43].",

            "text": "In keeping with these observations, Bergers et al. [39] similarly demonstrated that infiltrating neutrophils were an important source of MMP-9, the elaboration of which is strongly associated with angiogenesis and tumor growth. The authors employed a model of pancreatic islet cancer, in which mice spontaneously form dysplastic lesions, which progress to carcinomas by 12\u201314 weeks of age [39]. During progression, dysplastic lesions exhibit enhanced angiogenesis as they develop into carcinomas [39]. This transition in phenotype has been termed the \u201cangiogenic switch\u201d [39, 42]. Using this model, the authors demonstrated dense populations of infiltrating neutrophils within dysplastic lesions undergoing angiogenesis [39]. Staining for MMP-9 revealed that its source was infiltrating neutrophils as opposed to neoplastic cells [39]. Infiltrating neutrophils were similarly observed in lesions that had progressed to carcinomas [39]. This observation suggested that MMP-9 expression by infiltrating neutrophils supported tumor development, possibly through facilitating the angiogenic switch [39]. Accordingly, neutrophil depletion with anti-GR1 antibodies resulted in a 57 % reduction in the number of angiogenic lesions, if depletion occurred early in tumor development during the hyperplastic/dysplastic phase [39]. Conversely, depletion of neutrophils at a later time point (11 weeks of age) did not alter tumor number or size [39]. These data suggest that neutrophil infiltration and the concomitant expression of MMP-9 are important in instigating angiogenic switch [39]. Although this is demonstrated within the primary tumor, the concept of MMP-9-mediated angiogenesis could be at play in a similar fashion within budding metastases. In this manner, NETs could act to support tumor development at distant organ sites. Note that anti-GR1 is not neutrophil specific, as it can bind to the Ly6C receptor, which is also found on dendritic cells and subsets of monocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, and can therefore eliminate these cells in addition to neutrophils [44]. As shown in literature, it has however been extensively used to deplete neutrophils in murine disease models [45\u201350] and the above-mentioned study is among this extensive body of literature. In an attempt to rectify these potential problems, additional studies have employed anti-GR1 Ly6G antibodies that demonstrate enhanced specificity to the granulocyte lineage, of which neutrophils are the most abundant [44, 51, 52].",

Ablation of neutrophils in dysplastic islet lesions is associated with a reduction in VEGF:VEGFR co-localization by a factor of approximately 90 % [39, 42]. Inhibition of MMP-9 with the specific small molecule inhibitor R94138 resulted in a decrease in the frequency of angiogenic switch and a consequent 70\u201380 % reduction in the number of tumors [39, 42]. This implicates neutrophil-derived MMP-9 as the mediator of the angiogenic switch in this particular model [39, 42]. In addition, exogenous MMP-9 was able to render non-angiogenic islet lesions into angiogenic ex vivo. This effect was reduced by administration of anti-VEGF antibodies and could be replicated by the addition of heparanase, suggesting MMP-9 acts by liberating VEGF from the ECM via its proteolytic activity [39, 42].",

Cathepsin G has been shown to facilitate the formation of tumor aggregates in in vitro models of breast cancer [59, 60]. Yui et al. [60] demonstrated that human MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines spontaneously formed spherical cell aggregates in the presence of neutrophils or following culture in the presence of activated neutrophil supernatant. Aggregation was mediated by intercellular adhesion via E-cadherin [60]. Neutrophil-derived cathepsin G was found to be partially responsible for this aggregating phenotype, as exogenous addition of recombinant cathepsin G to MCF-7 cells in culture induced aggregation [60]. Furthermore, in the presence of activated neutrophil supernatant, inhibition of cathepsin G abolished the aggregation of MCF-7 cells [60]. A similar study from the same group demonstrated that tumor cell aggregation was mediated by binding of cathepsin G to the cell surface and required its enzymatic activity [59].",

In human lung cancers, elevated levels of cathepsin G have been correlated with tumor grade and stage [63]. The source of cathepsin G in these tissues was localized to tumor-infiltrating neutrophils as determined by immunohistochemistry [63]. Cathepsin G has been shown to facilitate the formation of osteolytic bone lesions in models of breast cancer metastasis [61, 62]. Wilson et al. [62] demonstrated elevated levels of cathepsin G at the tumor\u2013bone interface of murine breast cancer cells implanted into mouse calvarium. Bone lesion formation was mediated by increased osteoclastogenesis as a result of elevated cathepsin G production, induced by tumor cells. Inhibition of cathepsin G using the small molecule inhibitor TCPK resulted in diminished bony lesion formation [62].",

Along these lines, an additional study by Wilson et al. [62] demonstrated that cathepsin G might favor angiogenesis within osteolytic bony metastases in a murine model of breast cancer metastasis. Using a model of intra-calvarial tumor cell injection, the authors demonstrated reduced angiogenesis following administration of an exogenous cathepsin G inhibitor (TPCK) as determined by quantification of micro-vessel density [62]. This reduction in endothelial ingrowth was associated with reduced expression of both VEGF mRNA and protein [62]. Collectively, the evidence suggests that cathepsin G may act to facilitate ECM remodeling, favoring tumor progression and potentially metastasis in both experimental models and human disease [62].",

In keeping with this observation, proliferation of A549 cells in the presence of WT PMN was attenuated in the presence of an NE inhibitor [76]. Furthermore, addition of exogenous NE produced a similar, albeit more modest increase in proliferation at concentrations from 40 to 80 nM [76].

Activation of PI3K was necessary for proliferation as evidenced by the fact that NE-mediated proliferation of A549 cells is attenuated in the presence of the specific PI3K inhibitors [76]. Furthermore, this was dependent on internalization of NE into endosomes within A549 cells [70, 76]. This was found to lead to degradation of IRS-1 within the cytoplasm ultimately leading to PI3K activation and increased proliferation [70, 76].",

[73] demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the proliferation of four separate esophageal cancer cell lines following addition of exogenous NE. This was inhibited by the addition of the NE inhibitor sivelestat [73]. Addition of NE was accompanied by an increase in concentrations of transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) within the tumor cell culture supernatant, suggesting that NE may act by liberating these factors into the extracellular environment, potentially favoring interactions with their cognate receptors [73]. Along these lines, an additional study by the same authors demonstrated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling as a direct consequence of the effects of NE on gastric carcinoma cell lines in vitro [75]. As with the esophageal cell lines, this translated into enhanced proliferation, which was abrogated by sivelestat [75]. Again, this was mediated by the proteolytic liberation of TGF-\u03b1 from the cell surface [75]. Nawa et al. [77] demonstrated similar effects of NE and concomitant TGF-\u03b1 signaling in an in vitro model of breast cancer. Taken together, these data support both direct and indirect roles for NE in promoting tumor cell proliferation.",

This phenotype was replicated by exogenous administration of NE (3 \u03bcg/ml) [72].

This enhanced migratory phenotype was similarly attenuated by exogenous inhibition of NE [72]. The invasive potential of PDAC cells, demonstrated by using a Matrigel trans-well assay, was similarly increased by the addition of NE (1 \u03bcg/ml).

Under static conditions, tumor cell adhesion to neutrophil monolayers was enhanced four to fivefold following neutrophil pretreatment with PMA to induce NET formation compared to untreated controls. For example, following intrasplenic injection of LLC cells in septic mice, enhanced tumor cell arrest within the hepatic microvasculature can be directly visualized in vivo compared to healthy controls [90, 92]. Furthermore, CTC arrest frequently occurs after direct contact with intravascular neutrophils, whose recruitment is enhanced during systemic infection. Depletion of neutrophils abrogates this effect and results in diminished overall CTC adhesion within the liver [90, 92]. In addition, the development of gross metastasis is decreased suggesting that increased adhesive events via direct CTC-neutrophil contact are an important precursor to the development of metastatic disease [90, 92].",

In vitro, PMA treatment of human neutrophils was used to induce NET formation. In the presence of NETs, adhesion of murine (H59) and human (A549) lung carcinoma cells was increased approximately four to fivefold compared to the control. Degradation of NETs using DNAse 1 or inhibition of NET formation by pretreatment of neutrophil monolayers with NEi abrogated the increased tumor adhesion observed after PMA stimulation in both cell lines [32]. Imaging with both confocal and electron microscopy in this study demonstrated cancer cells trapped within webs of extracellular DNA. These NETs appeared to be wrapped around adherent tumor cells and in direct contact with the tumor cell membrane. Neutrophils, however, appeared to be in proximity to, but not in direct contact with, the tumor cells, suggesting that an adhesive mechanism was mediated by trapping within NETs (Fig. 1).\n",

Following injection of murine lung (H59) or melanoma (B16-F10) cells via the tail vein, tumor\u2013NET interactions were quantified and visualized using spinning disc confocal intravital microscopy (SD-IVM). Tumor arrest was significantly increased after CLP compared to mice subject to sham surgery or those administered DNAse 1 or NEi after CLP. Furthermore, direct tumor\u2013NET interactions could be visualized suggesting a mechanical trapping effect of NETs on tumor cells following their interaction. In response to systemic infection, widespread NET deposition occurs within end organ microvasculature such as the hepatic sinusoidal spaces and pulmonary capillaries. NET deposition is vulnerable to pharmacologic inhibition with DNAse and NEi. Furthermore, intravascular NET deposition is abolished by neutrophil depletion. If septic mice are subject to IV administration of LLC cells, gross hepatic metastasis formation is significantly enhanced compared to non-septic mice (Fig. 2). However, following administration of DNAse or NEi to septic mice, in an attempt to diminish NET deposition, gross hepatic metastasis formation was attenuated. These findings mirror what was observed with respect to NET deposition with end organ microvasculature suggesting that NETs may play a role in trapping CTC.\n",

[34] suggests that NETs may play a direct proliferative role and in fact may inhibit apoptosis under certain conditions. In this manner, they may act to promote metastasis formation. Data from our own group support this finding. In a previous study, we demonstrate that following sequestration within NETs, CTCs are able to form stable micro metastatic foci and, as previously stated, ultimately go on to form macro metastases. This implies that trapped cells are able not only to survive interactions with NETs, but are also able to grow. Furthermore, if mice were injected with LLC cells prior to the septic insult, hepatic metastatic disease burden was still abrogated by DNAse and NEi administration. In this model, the contribution of early adhesive events to metastasis formation was eliminated (Fig. 2). At the very least, this result suggests that NETs can influence tumor progression in multiple ways. Taken together, these data support a pro-metastatic role for NETs; however the mechanisms by which NETs may act to produce clinically apparent metastasis are multiple. First, they may act simply by promoting early adhesive events, thus increasing sequestration of malignant cells in end organs leading to a greater number of metastases. Additionally, NETs may act by directly promoting a more malignant phenotype in neoplastic cells as a consequence of their interaction.",

The levels have been shown to correlate with both tumor stage and progression-free survival [74, 86, 98].

Postoperatively, patients in the sivelestat group experienced reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, reduced duration of SIRS, reduced length of ICU stay and a trend toward reduced overall hospital stay [100]. Furthermore, patients in the sivelestat group demonstrated a more rapid reduction in postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) [100]. Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that perioperative NE inhibition may act to reduce inflammatory burden on patients resulting in improved clinical outcomes. In keeping with the hypothesis that the systemic inflammatory insult that follows surgery may act to promote tumor progression, it would be interesting to know if this is also associated with tumor progression. However, no such studies have been performed to date.",

Recent evidence has re-introduced the neutrophil as a potential key player in influencing a number of neoplastic processes in addition to their role in host defense from infection. With regard to cancer, seemingly opposite roles have been demonstrated [104]. However, the scope of neutrophil responses appears to be broader than previously thought and the possibility that neutrophils can exhibit diverse phenotypes is beginning to take hold. This being said, some evidence strongly suggests that neutrophils can take on behaviors in the context of tumor progression that are catastrophic to the host.",

These include MMP-9, CG and NE, all of which have demonstrated roles in multiple stages of the metastatic cascade. It is possible that NETs provide a structure on which these peptides are able to interact with neoplastic cells. In this manner, NETs may provide a microenvironment with a high local concentration of pro-tumorigenic proteins, which favor their interaction with tumor cells by bringing them into close proximity with one another. Possible pro-neoplastic effector mechanisms include intravascular adhesion, enhanced tumor cell growth, enhanced migration and invasion, and increased angiogenesis. Direct intravascular adhesion has been demonstrated between NETs and neoplastic cells, both in vitro and in vivo [32]. Enhanced tumor growth may occur via increased proliferation directly. This could possibly be mediated by the direct activity of MMP-9 and NE. In addition, anti-apoptotic effects of NETs on neoplastic cells have been demonstrated [34, 38, 40, 70, 73, 76]. NETs could act to facilitate migration and invasion, thus promoting the development of metastases. Possible mechanisms include MMP-9\u2013ECM interactions, CG-mediated cellular aggregate formation and E-cadherin disruption via NE [32, 41, 61, 62, 72, 73, 76, 86]. Finally, angiogenesis could be promoted via MMP-9 and NE- and CG-mediated VEGF liberation from the ECM [34, 38, 40, 70, 73, 76]",
