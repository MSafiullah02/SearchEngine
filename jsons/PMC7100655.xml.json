It is likely that the decreased levels of SP-D, which have been observed in different clinical situations, increase the risk of infections (Holmskov et al. 2003). Clinically, serum SP-D levels have been used as biomarkers for lower respiratory tract infections, acute lung injury and type II cell hyperplasia as seen in pulmonary fibrosis and other forms of interstitial lung diseases (Takahashi et al. 2000; Asano et al. 2001; Ohnishi et al. 2002).",

(2000) would have been near or above 0.05 if it had been corrected for multiple testing and there were no replication in either study.

Based on the genotypic data, we used an expectation\u2013maximization algorithm to estimate the frequencies of putative SFTPD haplotypes (frequency >1%) and have suggested a nomenclature according to haplotype frequency. Four common putative haplotypes with a cumulative frequency of >74% were identified.",

The elevation of SP-D is related to the extent of the parenchymal lung disease and predicts survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Greene et al. 2002). Serum SP-D is also increased in patients with acute ARDS (Greene et al. 1990) and patients with clinical pneumonia (Leth-Larsen et al. 2003). In these conditions, elevated SP-D serum levels were partly accounted to leakage from the alveolar space, since alveolar type II cells are regarded as the main cellular source of SP-D. Although the lung is the major site of SP-D expression, it is likely that the protein has more generalized roles in host defence and the acute response to infection and tissue injury (Crouch 2000).",
