Moreover, Sill\u00f3et al. (2012) and Watanabe et al. (2012) wrote two separate reports that provided supportive evidence of a fatal cases of human infection with M. arginini. Each affected patient had an apparent history or possibility of exposure to a wild animal or animal products, thereby suggesting a zoonotic transmission of M. arginini to humans. That said, only three cases of M. arginini isolation occurred, though all people affected by the disease were exposed to various animals in different settings (e.g. slaughterhouse, lion attack, etc.) (Yechouron et al., 1992; Prayson et al., 2008; Sill\u00f3 et al., 2012).",

Specimens were obtained aseptically using a sterile scalpel while taking precautions to prevent surface contamination. Following collection, the samples were transported to the microbiology laboratory in special ice-filled containers within 2 hours of sampling. Pieces of tissue from the border area between disease lesions and healthy lung were suspended by pounding in a mortar with sand and liquid growth medium. The suspension was inoculated into broth growth media with added Mycoplasma Supplement G. Dilutions of up to 10\u22125 of the liquid medium was prepared. The inoculated medium was incubated 7\u201310 days at 37\u00b0C in an incubator with 5 % CO2. The growth medium was checked daily for growth. A loopful of the broth cultures showing Mycoplasma growth or color change were inoculated onto Mycoplasma Agar Base media in a 95 % N2 and 5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C; the petri dishes were examined in stereomicroscopy at the end of incubation.

Several non-M. bovis species are of interest in cattle with varying degrees of clinical significance of which M. arginini comes to our interest (Parker et al., 2018). There is debate on whether these are truly new emerging pathogens or pre-existing pathogens that are now easier to detect due to the advent of sophisticated molecular diagnostic tools and more frequent diagnostic testing. For decades, the role of other bacterial agents such as M. arginini has been questioned (Yechouron et al., 1992; Watanabe et al., 2012). It is unknown whether certain Mycoplasma species such as M. arginini act as a medical hazard. It is of significance to emphasize that, the 48 M. arginini isolates were from the pneumonic lungs and not from the healthy lungs. This was also encountered in other animals reflecting that most mycoplasmas are normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract but do not appear in the lungs of healthy animals (Thomas and Smith, 1972; Tan et al., 1977a; Thomas et al., 2002; Aroch et al., 2008; Mohamed et al., 2018).",

Gro\u00dfhennig et al. (2016) shared results confirming H2S production and hemolysis were correlated in M. pneumonia. This was the first time that correlation was recorded for M. arginini isolated from camels, where H2S was not previously identified as a virulence factor in lung pathogens in camels.

The research conducted in this study concluded that catalase played only a minor role in hemolysis by M. arginini, similar to the property found in M. pneumoniae and that the discoloration of hemoglobin was specifically attributed to cysteine-dependent formation of H2S2 ions. This data was also in accordance to the findings of Gro\u00dfhennig et al. (2016). On the other hand, the induced weak biofilm formation by M. arginini in this study could be attributed as a reflection to the weak production of catalase, which is considered as an enhancement factor for biofilm growth and formation (Simmons et al., 2015).",

Several studies in the past years have shown that pathogenic mycoplasmas are equipped with sophisticated genetic systems, which allow these agents to spontaneously change their surface antigenic make-up (Jeqchlingeret al., 2004; Chopra-Dewasthaly et al., 2017). It is implicated that these variable surface components provide the wall-less mycoplasmas with a means to avoid the host immune response and promote host colonization (Jeqchlinger et al., 2004). The uvrC gene is well conserved and an enzyme that is essential for replication, as it is involved with DNA repair, making it a highly stable gene (Thomas et al., 2004) and a much more specific target gene than 16S rRNA (Subramaniam et al., 1998). In our investigation this was not the case and the uvrC gene failed to be evident in addition to the other two virulence genes, vsp and gapA. There were 16 genes found to be essential in previous studies on other mycoplasma species that were found to be dispensable (Sharma et al., 2014). Of these, five genes have previously been predicted to be part of the core set of 153 essential genes in mycoplasmas (Sharma et al., 2014).",

A strange and unexpected situation occurred, which raises the question of the dispensability of these genes in M. arginini isolated from camel. Moreover, this study could extend the list of non-essential genes of mycoplasmas that were previously generated by studies in other species (Sharma et al., 2014).",

Second, isolates were selected from imported camels, thereby suggesting a further analysis conducted with domestic camel isolates. Third, the potential of whole genome sequencing (WGS) must be implemented to provide more detailed information than traditional molecular typing methods. This further exploration of genomic diversity among M. arginini isolates can advance the epidemiological information specific to at-risk populations for an important, yet often underestimated, respiratory pathogen. This information can highlight biological risks from a public health perspective as well as identify the emergence of new variants or genetic features that may impact transmission or virulence.",
