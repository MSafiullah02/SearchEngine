It is the first member of the Metapneumovirus genus in Pneumoviriae, Paramyxoviridae, associated with human diseases (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). Currently, sequence analysis for hMPV isolates indicates that there are two major genetic lineages (genotypes A and B) (Bastien et al., 2003, Biacchesi et al., 2003). As an important viral pathogen causing acute lower respiratory infections in children, hMPV is the second viral pathogen of bronchiolitis during infancy and early childhood next to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Skiadopoulos et al., 2006). HMPV associated acute respiratory infections in infants and young children was reported by the same research group of this study in 2003 (Zhu et al., 2003), which was the first report about hMPV infection in China. Since then, surveillance of hMPV infections in children in Beijing has been conducted by antigen test, virus isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Zhu et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2010).",

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed originally as a rapid diagnostic method for the detection of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions (Notomi et al., 2000, Mori and Notomi, 2009). The LAMP assay utilizes four primers, which are specific for six gene sequences on the targeted DNA. The products can be observed as a white precipitant of magnesium pyrophosphate. LAMP and RT-LAMP have been used for detecting various DNA and RNA viruses (Mori et al., 2004, Yoneyama et al., 2007, Curtis et al., 2009, Kubo et al., 2010, Luo et al., 2011). To obtain a rapid and reliable assay to detect hMPV from clinical specimens collected from pediatric patients with acute respiratory infections, a RT-LAMP assay was developed for identifying hMPV A and hMPV B from clinical specimens under isothermal conditions at 63 \u00b0C within 60 min and the results can be judged by naked eyes. This assay could be used as a diagnostic method in laboratories, especially in those hospitals or clinics with limited equipment.",

Several studies focused on the relatedness between genotypes and disease severity (Skiadopoulos et al., 2004, Agapov et al., 2006). Although most of the published data suggested that disease severity was not related with a particular genotype (Agapov et al., 2006, Pitoiset et al., 2010), the extensive investigation on pathogenicity, cross-protective effectiveness and epidemiology for different hMPV genotypes has an important role in the vaccine development.

RNA can be amplified effectively using reverse transcriptase (RTase) together with DNA polymerase. LAMP employs a set of four specifically designed primers (not including two loop primers, which only for time saving) that recognize six distinct sequences of the target. Only when two pairs of specific primers match the target sequences exactly can the gene amplification starts. Therefore, RT-LAMP offers a high level of specificity for reverse transcription and cDNA amplification reactions of RNA viruses under isothermal environments plus the advantages of saving time and reducing experimental error. It is not necessary to open the reaction tubes in the detecting process, which can reduce the risk of contamination. In this study, the detecting limits for both hMPV A and B by genotype-specific RT-LAMP were 10 times greater than conventional RT-PCR. No cross-reaction was shown when templates of hMPV A and B were mixed, indicating that this assay was of highly specificity for detecting and differentiating hMPV A and B. According to the reaction time spent for testing the 63 positive clinical samples (13.5\u201358.2 min, average 24.8 min), the entire testing process can be completed within 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63 \u00b0C.

Mori (Mori et al., 2004) designed a real-time monitoring turbidimeter for keeping stable and consistent temperature and measure the turbidities from amplification in multiple tubes from different clinical samples real-timely and simultaneously. Using this apparatus, the efficiency of the reactions can be observed real-timely and the exact reaction peak time can be determined, which is useful and helpful for the developing of a new LAMP assay for a specific target. Additionally, results can be readily observed by the white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate generated during the reaction or by color change by the daylight or UV light via adding FDR in the reaction mixture. Besides thermostatic equipment, no more laboratory equipments are required for the result determination. Therefore, RT-LAMP assay is easy to perform and efficient to determine the positive results. In this study, it was found that the reaction time was extended due to adding FDR, suggesting that the shorter reaction time might lead to a false negative result despite no disagreement in the final qualitative judgment of sample detection. Although the results were consistent when judged by turbidimeter and visual observation with naked eyes under the natural light or under UV Lamp when FDR was added, it could not be ruled out the possibility of false negative determination if the clinical samples contain less RNA copies which are close to the detection limit when judged by naked eyes.
