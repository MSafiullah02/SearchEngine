As data regarding health problems in civilian travelers are globally comparable to those reported in deployed soldiers, this chapter will focus on the specifics of the deployed military population and its main incapacitating medical threats. The deployed military represent a special category of travelers characterized as a young, disciplined, trained, predominantly male population that is strictly selected, controlled, and regularly monitored, and that typically travels in a group accompanied by some level of medical care. Medical readiness (basically equivalent to the civilian pretravel consultation) is an overriding concern of all commanders. It is a policy-driven force health protection approach based on physical, dental, and psychological examinations with mandatory lab and/or radiologic investigations according to the service personnel's country. It includes obligatory health education sessions regarding the specific deployment-related risks and up-to-date immunizations based on the country and service's health policies (Table  36 .1 provides information for US personnel). Any contraindication for vaccination results in ineligibility for deployment.",

As an example, the French conquest of Madagascar in 1895 resulted in approximately 6000 malaria-related deaths for <30 killed in action. 6 A recent prospective study ( Fig. 36.1 ) showed similar findings with NCRI, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and respiratory disorders representing the leading causes of health issues during deployment. The same authors reported a significant burden for infectious diseases (41% of all etiologies), with ubiquitous infections in the majority of cases. 7 As with civilian travelers, the use of alcohol and drugs has been associated with an increased incidence of accidents, emotional disorders, and sexually transmitted infections. [8] [9] [10] Alcoholrelated regulations vary according to the country of origin and country of deployment, but the authors recommend restrictions against the use of alcohol on deployment to minimize these risks. Continuing information and education, and prohibiting alcohol and drug use/abuse during rotations, should help to decrease the rates of NCRI and other alcohol and/or drug-associated medical issues.",

Tactical combat casualty care, improved protection gear and armored vehicles, deployed forward surgical teams applying damage control surgery and resuscitation, advances in transfusion (fresh frozen plasma and platelets, lyophilized plasma, whole blood transfusion), and early medical evacuation have been associated with remarkably improved outcomes for the severely injured. [12] [13] [14] [15] However, the increased survival of patients sustaining severe pelvic, spinal, and extremity wounds with amputations has highlighted the essential role of rehabilitation medicine (improved prosthetics), psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers in supporting the wounded and their families. 16 ",

For example, during the Peninsular War of 1808-1814, half of all admissions in British troops were for gonorrhea and syphilis. 33 The pursuit of pleasure during war campaigns led to the establishment of military brothels that were shut down in the late 20th century but unfortunately replaced by local civilian bordellos. The military are an \"at-risk\" sexually active population as approximately one-third are in the under 25-year-old age category-the age range that experiences the highest rate of STIs. 33 High incomes and purchasing power during deployments, feeling of invincibility, influence of pornography, sexual deprivation, cultural interactions, and group dynamics can generate a high prevalence of STI-associated behaviors like binge drinking and drug use, lack of condom use, and multiple sexual partnerships. 9 A recent US study, conducted in the Navy, shifted the focus of STI acquisition among male shipboard sailors from sex workers to predominantly regular sexual partners within the local military community as the consequence of the growing number of female recruits. 34 Other authors showed that family/personal life stress and psychological distress influenced the number of partnerships more strongly for women than for men. 9 Another emerging issue of the growing number of women in the military is unwanted pregnancies during deployment. 35 Preventing STIs and unintended pregnancies requires information and education, access to condoms and contraceptives, and prohibiting alcohol and drug use/abuse during rotations.",

            "text": "Due to service personnel's living and working conditions such as crowding, close contact, diminished cleanliness, compromised skin integrity (friction blisters, cracks or tinea pedis in the feet, cuts and abrasions), military status is a recognized risk factor for streptococcal and staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections (impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses, Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive Staphylococcus aureus skin infection). 36 During deployments to tropical or subtropical destinations, these skin conditions tend to occur more frequently because of the increased heat and humidity, exacerbated by wearing heavy protective gear, and reduced washing and laundry facilities. In addition, they are harder to treat under such circumstances. 29 These environmental and lifestyle factors also facilitate superficial fungal infections that may develop in >50% of soldiers, presenting as tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, tinea axillae, tinea capitis, onychomycosis, and/or pityriasis versicolor. 29 Due to the maceration in combat boots, feet not only pay a heavy price in terms of fungal and gram-positive cocci infections but also of other conditions such as pitted keratolysis (Corynebacterium sp.) (Fig. 36.2) . These lower limb lesions in turn increase the risk of erysipelas and cellulitis with the potential for significant negative impact on force availability. 36 Additional skin disorders include other corynebacterial infections (erythrasma and trichomycosis) and heat rash (miliaria crystallina, miliaria rubra, miliaria pustulosa, and miliaria profunda). Tropical climate-related bacterial and fungal infections can also be associated with delayed wound healing. 37 Prevention of these infections is based on strict hygiene measures including washing/drying or changing clothes daily (or multiple times a day if needed), and if feasible, airing skin and feet out when possible. Regular self-examination of the feet for early treatment of infections and practices on the part of both medical providers and those deployed can have a major impact on disease burden. 20, 21 Militaries operationalize protective countermeasures through a layered approach that includes use of permethrin-impregnated uniforms and nets, and DEET-containing repellents, vaccines, and chemoprophylaxis medications. From its earliest use among allied forces in the Pacific campaign of World War II, adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis has been a challenge, leading to the dictum that ensuring adherence to chemoprophylaxis is a command responsibility and not just a medical responsibility. 6, 22, 23 One notable exception to this experience was the very high rate of reported adherence among US military forces deployed to Liberia as part of the Ebola response in Operation United Assistance in 2014-2015, with no cases occurring while deployed. 24 Faced with high threat of infectious disease during the operation, the military health community provided robust, expert-level consultation on force health protection measures to all deploying forces and leveraged command support to consistently reinforce prevention policies and procedures. 25 Force health protection policy (FHPP), set by theater commanders, establishes the countermeasures at the unit-level population, separate from individualized decision-making that may occur during an individual medical visit. Specific medication recommendations for a deployed force balance intensity of transmission, drug resistance, impact of nonadherence on efficacy, and medication cost. For example, current US military policy establishes either atovaquone-proguanil or doxycycline as first line chemoprophylaxis regimens and restricts the use of mefloquine to those both intolerant of first line agents and properly screened for contraindications. 26 This entails the use, in US troops, of atovaquoneproguanil in high-threat settings, to include most of sub-Saharan Africa, and the use of doxycycline in lower threat regions such as Southwest Asia. Another example would be the French health corps policy that uses doxycycline as the only first line chemoprophylactic drug to optimize adherence. 6 Use of primaquine for presumptive antirelapse therapy (PART) is typically recommended following deployments to risk areas for Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale. FHPP is constrained by Food and Drug Administration labeling to restrict the use of investigational products, which has historically been applied to dosing considerations of primaquine. Hence the US military lagged civilian practice, using 15 mg of primaquine base daily versus the current recommendation of 30 mg of base daily. Department of Defense (DOD) policies do in fact allow for a \"standard of care\" dosage to be recommended under FHPP. 27 Force-wide testing of US recruits for G6PD deficiency is standard practice.",

As a consequence systemic treatment (pentamidine isethionate or meglumine antimoniate) requiring close monitoring is recommended for infected French soldiers. 30 The prevention approach for arboviral diseases centers on the use of vaccines, when available, and proper wearing of the uniform and and high altitude and novel pathogens endemic to that region. 39 Clinical presentations include the \"common cold,\" the \"flu\" (influenza-like illness), bronchitis, and pneumonia. Influenza virus is the classic respiratory scourge of the military, but other respiratory viruses such rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenoviruses are common causes of cold and flu symptoms. Pneumonia is most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza virus. Pneumonia epidemics due to adenovirus type 14 (Ad14) reemerged among US military recruits when a vaccine was not available. Strategies to reduce the incidence and impact of respiratory infections include an emphasis on hygiene measures (hand-washing, reduced crowding, cohorting of ill, etc.), vaccination for common pathogens (influenza, Ad14), antibiotic prophylaxis (penicillin in US training camps to reduce group A strep pharyngitis), and early diagnosis and directed treatment of infection.",

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter, and Shigella have been identified as causing 38%-45% of diarrhea. 40 Viral causes are less common but are frequent causes of outbreaks. 38 Prevention is based on rapidly establishing and maintaining effective sanitation and provision of clean food and water. To reduce the operational impact of diarrhea and to avoid associated deployment complications of dehydration and heat injury, rapid, effective treatment with a single-dose antibiotic (azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone) and loperamide is typically recommended. 38, 41 The risk of respiratory infections is thought to be an increased because of crowded living conditions compounded by relative immune compromise brought on by physical and emotional stress. 39 This is exacerbated by exposure to dust and smoke, extremes of temperature, ",
