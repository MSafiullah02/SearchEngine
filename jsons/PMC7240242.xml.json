However, to date, there is no clinically available method to early identify patients with severe progression tendency following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we designed a simple algorithm which helps in early identification of COVID-19 progression, and aimed to provide a clinically available method to regulate the large flow of SARS-CoV-2 infection patients between primary health care and tertiary centers.",

The possible reasons for the lower severe rate and fatality rate are as follows. First, the control measures (early discovery, early isolation, early diagnosis, and early management) have been undertaken, and enough health workers and medical services have been provided at the early time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai, China. Second, all imported persons were tested with PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 before they were released from quarantine.
