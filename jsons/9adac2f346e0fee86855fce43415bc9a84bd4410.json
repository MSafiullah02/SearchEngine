This has resulted in the inability to care for patients valvular and structural heart disease (SHD) in a timely fashion potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications including congestive heart failure and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, we suggest guidelines as to how to triage patients in need of SHD interventions and provide a framework of how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, we address the triage of patients in need of trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair. We also address procedural issues and considerations for the function of structural heart disease teams during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Therefore, decisions regarding timing of SHD interventions must consider the risk of delaying the procedure, the risk for the patient of COVID-19 exposure outside of home shelter, and utilization of limited hospital resources. Compounding this challenge is the geographical variation in the peak of the pandemic within the United States, and the significant delay in restoration of normal health care operations after the immediate threat has passed. The length of this delay is unknown but could be many months subsequent to the peak which poses distinct challenges for rescheduling procedures. The purpose of this document is to provide a framework for SHD teams to triage patients in need of SHD intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss evaluation and procedural considerations for these patients.",

A single interventional cardiologist and cardiac surgeon should assume a leadership position and be given the authority to arbitrate challenging cases.

The majority of TAVR procedures do not require intensive care unit recovery after the procedure, and this is important as critical care beds will be limited during the COVID-19 crisis in parts of the country.

The major aerosolization risk to the interventional imager and cardiac anesthesia team occurs during the initial intubation and any TEE probe manipulation thereafter in a non-intubated patient. In an already ventilated patient, care should be made that aThe SHD clinic is a vital entry point for patients with valvular/SHD into the health care system. In preparation for a procedure, patients require visits with multiple physicians and additional visits for imaging. Having patients make multiple trips to the hospital should be avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize the risk of virus transmission among inpatients, outpatients, and health care personnel. The SHD clinic should help coordinate SHD patient visits, and efforts should be made to utilize telemedicine for consultations. If a patient requires treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-procedure visits and imaging should be consolidated to a single hospital encounter prior to the procedure as possible. It will be important to maintain typical SHD clinic volumes with virtual visits during the pandemic so that preparations can be made to treat patients in need of SHD intervention as soon as possible once normal hospital operations are restored. Recently, the STS/ACC TVT registry allowed for substitution of in-person visits with telephone or virtual visits for the 30-day and 1-year followup visits. While some elements of these registries cannot be collected with remote follow-up, this will need to be addressed at a future date.",
