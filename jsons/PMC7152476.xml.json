Although infected and noninfected patients were separated, nosocomial transmission continued, largely because of the lack of minimal aseptic procedures, coupled with the fact that infected patients were not separated from each other by disease. By 1890 to 1900, nursing textbooks discussed recommendations for practicing aseptic procedures and designating separate floors or wards for patients with similar diseases, thereby beginning to solve the problems of nosocomial transmission (Lynch, 1949).",

These practices were used in U.S. infectious disease hospitals. By the 1960s, the designation of specifically designed single- or multiple-patient isolation rooms in general hospitals and outpatient treatment for tuberculosis caused these specialized hospitals (which since the 1950s had housed tuberculosis patients almost exclusively) to close (Garner, 1996).",

This happened even if additional training of personnel was encouraged.

An apron or other barrier was also to be worn to keep the provider's own clothing and skin clean. It was recommended also that personnel be immunized if proof of immunity could not be documented when barriers, such as masks, could not prevent transmission by airborne routes (e.g., rubella, chickenpox). Additionally, when immunity was not possible, as with pulmonary tuberculosis, masks were to be worn during all patient contact. Goggles or glasses, hair covers, and shoe covers were also used as barriers. Careful handling of all used sharps, recapping of needles without using the hands, and the disposal of used items in rigid puncture-resistant containers were stressed. Trash and soiled linen from all patients were bagged and handled in the same manner. This approach sought to protect the patient from contracting nosocomial infections and the provider from bacterial or viral pathogens that might originate with the patient.",

Additionally, confusion developed as to whether one should use universal precautions and body substance isolation guidelines, because both guidelines dealt with similar circumstances but offered conflicting recommendations. The guideline for isolation precautions in hospitals was revised in 1996 by the CDC and the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), which had been established in 1991 to serve in a guiding and advisory capacity to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Assistant Secretary of Health of the DHHS, the Director of the CDC, and the Director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases with respect to hospital infection control practices and U.S. hospital surveillance, prevention, and control strategies for nosocomial infections. The CDC guideline revision was designed to include the following objectives:(1) to be epidemiologically sound; (2) to recognize the importance of all body fluids, secretions, and excretions in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens; (3) to contain adequate precautions for infections transmitted by the airborne, droplet, and contact routes of transmission; (4) to be as simple and user friendly as possible; and (5) to use new terms to avoid confusion with existing infection control and isolation systems.(Garner, 1996)\n",
