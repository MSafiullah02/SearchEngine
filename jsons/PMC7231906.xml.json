The elderly with hypertension have lower ACE2 levels and higher RAS\nsignalling, which develops to extremely low ACE2 levels and markedly elevated RAS\nsignalling after COVID-19 infection, resulting in a likely reduced incidence of\ndisease, but greater severity.55 On the contrary, younger\nindividuals without hypertension have higher ACE2 levels and lower RAS signalling,\nwhich turns to modestly low ACE2 levels and modestly enhanced RAS signalling after\nthey are infected with COVID-19, resulting in a potentially increased incidence of\ndisease, but lesser severity. This supports the suggestion of continuing treatment\nwith RAS antagonists such as ACEI/ARB in order to prevent further lung injury due to\nCOVID-19, including sepsis-associated lung injury.55 The effect estimate for\nsubgroup analysis for age \u2a7e 55 and < 55 years old differs slightly, in which \u2a7e 55\nyears old was associated with slightly higher risk. However, because meta-regression\ndid not demonstrate significant differences across age groups, the significance\nremains uncertain, and direct comparison between the older and younger patients is\nneeded.",
