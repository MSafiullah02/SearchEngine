Such study was performed in healthy subjects only (despite a title that seems to depict otherwise) and, more importantly, the study was not peer-reviewed, but rather directly published 2 . A number of opinions and original contributions, all in highly respected journals, have made reference to that single study in order to scientifically support this hypothesis 1, 3-5 . This is concerning, as it suggests a willingness of authors to bypass stringently reviewed data in their rush to share scientific knowledge. In the case of clinical manuscripts, it is possible that the average reader will understand the quality of a study by looking at a range of familiar parameters. However, when such studies involve data related to single cell RNA sequencing, particularly in hepatocytes which has been shown to be particularly difficult to isolate and sequence, the reader is blind to the details of the study and directly susceptible to the conclusions of the authors. As we all, scientists and health care providers alike, participate selflessly in a race to mitigate the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and its implications to human health, we should become more efficient in navigating the current scientific standards, i.e. be more willing to and expedite in reviewing manuscripts, but resist the temptation to bypass these standards, as doing so will further contribute to misinformation and misguide.",

As mortality associated with the virus advances at a pace without precedent, so does the research and sharing of important information between the scientific and clinical communities worldwide. I read with great interest the article by Gu et al about COVID-19 and gastrointestinal manifestations 1 . In the article the authors report a detailed discussion about the role of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and its presence in cholangiocytes but not in hepatocytes as so to explain the pathophysiology of hepatic involvement by SARS-CoV2 1 . The authors hypothesize on the importance of the ACE2",
