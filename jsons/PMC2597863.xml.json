Common respiratory diseases are caused by a variety of viruses that have similar traits and affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Some common viruses are the influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), respiratory adenoviruses or coronavirus. Effective vaccines against respiratory viruses are not available, because all of them are highly mutable. Treatment with ribavirin and amantadine is not very useful. The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has opened up new possibility for drug development. The ability of RNAi to silence the expression of specific rogue genes provides a novel approach to treat a wide range of human disorders. In this review, the authors draw attention to the recent developments in RNAi-based therapeutics for the treatment of various viral respiratory diseases.",

In RNAi, long dsRNA is enzymatically cleaved by DICER (a dsRNA-specific RNase) into 20\u201322 nucleotide short interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA integrates into an endoribonuclease-containing protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) whereby the strands are separated and the antisense strand guides RISC to the complementary target mRNA sequence. A key component of RISC, called Argonaute, which is also an RNase, then slices the target mRNA, leading to the suppression of expression of the corresponding genes and subsequent decrease in the corresponding protein level. Thus, RNAi offers generally the advantage of high specificity and enhanced potency as prophylactic and therapeutic treatment in targeting previously obstinate disease-causing genes.",

Pandemics of flu have been recognized since the earliest recorded history and because of the mutability of the virus still represent an alarming threat [9].

Furthermore, as the viral antigens undergo mutations frequently, vaccines against influenza need to be reformulated every year given that the previous year's vaccine becomes ineffective against any new virus subtype. In cell culture and in embryonated chicken eggs, siRNA specific to nucleocapsid (NP) and a component of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (PA) abolished the accumulation of not only the corresponding mRNA but also virion RNA and its complementary RNA. These siRNAs also broadly inhibited the accumulation of other viral, but not cellular, RNAs [11, 12].",

The first outbreak of the disease in Asia resulted in over 8000 infections, about 10% of which resulted in death; however, no case in the US has been reported yet. The disease has no vaccine and no treatment. As in the case of other respiratory viruses, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has an RNA genome. The virus belongs to the family Nidovirales of positive-stranded RNA viruses known for their frequent mutations, creating difficulties for vaccine development [14]. Thus, the need for an effective anti-SARS drug cannot be overstated. To explore the possibility of interrupting SARS-CoV replication by RNAi, specific siRNAs targeting the viral spike [15], NP [16], RdRP [17, 18, 19] and envelop [19] protein genes as well as the leader sequence [20] were synthesized and introduced into mammalian cells. It was found that all anti-SARS siRNA inhibited viral gene expression. Such results may suggest a new, RNAi-mediated approach for the treatment and prevention of SARS.",

The first therapeutic action of siRNA in the lung was demonstrated for SARS-CoV [28]. siRNA against viral spike and NP protein with high potency in tissue culture experiments were used in an animal model of infection. Intranasal delivery of siRNA into virus-infected rhesus macaque SARS model [30], that emulates the sequence of pathogenesis in humans with SARS, showed the abrogation of viral infection in upper airway epithelial cells [28].",
