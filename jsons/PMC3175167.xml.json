There are several causes of this rare condition; mouse models with deletion of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) beta-chain showed the first evidence for involved molecularly mechanisms [3,4]. Autoantibodies against GM-CSF, blocking GM-CSF signaling, are the cause for the most frequent form of PAP, mainly found in adults and also called autoimmune PAP [5]. In 2008 the first two families with congenital PAP and mutations in the alpha-chain of the receptor for GM-CSF were described [6,7] and very recently another six families were reported [8]. The patients presented with progressive dyspnea of insidious onset between the ages of 1.5 and 9 years; some were asymptomatic. Short term responsiveness to whole lung lavage (WLL) treatment has been described, however not much information on the long term outcome of molecularly defined patients is yet available.",

After stimulation with GM-CSF, GM-CSF-Ra and CD11b remained low in the patient (Figure 7A, lower panel), whereas the parents' levels were in the normal range level. GM-CSF-Rb chain without and with GM-CSF stimulation was normal (Figure 7A). CD11b expression on the neutrophils was used to assess signal transduction after GM-CSF stimulation.

Impairment of the latter was shown directly in mononuclear cells of the patient after stimulation with GM-CSF. Impaired GMCSF receptor activation of alveolar macrophages leads to decreased surfactant catabolism and accumulation of surfactant in the alveolar space, i.e. alveolar proteinosis.",

Second, immune insufficiency, a problem also primarily resulting from abnormalities of the GM-CSF signal transduction pathway [20], may be augmented by immunosuppressive therapy initiated to treat the condition empirically. Therefore, molecular genetic definition of the basic defect in all children with PAP is important. Lastly, we describe the successful use of outcome measures of the efficacy of therapeutic WLL, including oxygen demand, and amount of washed out protein and phospholipids.",

Although therapeutic WLL is generally accepted as the established treatment option for PAP in adults, its optimal method, frequency of application and many other details are currently not known in infants or children. Here we show that consecutive lavages via a small catheter located in a main stem bronchus (Figure 3A) can be used to efficiently remove accumulated surfactant from the alveolar space in a very small child. Furthermore we show that it is helpful to monitor efficacy of the washing procedure by determination of proteins and lipids removed from the lungs [15]. These measurements allowed us to demonstrate only a marginal, but not clinically significant increase in the removal of surfactant material from the lungs, by the use of PFC for lavage. In a case report on an infant with alveolar proteinosis due Niemann Pick disease the usage of PFC was recently shown not to be of benefit as well [21].",

Currently we believe however that the risks of a bone marrow transplant (chronic graft versus host disease, among others) outweigh its benefits (elimination of need for WLL).

It is of interest that a dedicated specialized team may be advantageous to maintain the appropriate expertise of complex procedures such as e.g. whole lung lavages in small children [8,15,24,25]. Therefore a centralized approach, as it has been employed for rare lung diseases and PAP in particular on a national basis in France [24], may be warranted. A web-based system to collect these rare cases, follow them and also to receive support is available at the kids lung register (http://www.kids-lung-register.eu). The novel whole lung lavages technique using an inflatable balloon catheter was feasible in very small sized airways. Whereas empirical immunosuppressive therapy and inhaled and subcutaneous GMCSF were without significant benefit, a very intense treatment with WLL resulted in complete resolution of respiratory insufficiency, and a normalisation of lung physiology and overall somato-psychosocial condition of the child.",
