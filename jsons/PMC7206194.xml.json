Figure 1a shows the skewness of consumptions in Adressa dataset (see Sect. 4.1 for details), a real-world news service dataset; x-axis indicates the popularity ranks of news which could vary over time, and y-axis indicates the number of consumptions. As shown in the figure, interactions between users and news have popularity pattern, meaning that users mostly prefer popular news. For instance, the top-7 most popular articles account for 80% of total consumptions during the entire time. Figure 1b shows a freshness pattern in Adressa dataset, where the number of consumptions of each news rapidly decreases over its age. This indicates that customers prefer relatively fresh news since the novelty of news expires quickly over time. Thus, the challenge of designing an accurate news recommender systems is to consider the global temporal preference while taking into account each user\u2019s personal preference.\n",

Representing global temporal preference at time t as a low-rank latent vector is challenging since it has to involve both of popularity pattern and freshness pattern at that time. To deal with this challenge, PGT selects 1) document vectors of the most popular n articles at time t, which stand for popularity pattern, and 2) document vectors of the most fresh m articles at time t, which stand for freshness pattern. These vectors for the two different patterns are combined by the self-attention [15] with a scaled dot product (details in Sect. 3.2).Watch history. A user\u2019s previous watch history epitomizes the user\u2019s personal preference. The goal of PGT is to extract a sequential pattern in the watch history with regard to the global temporal preference. For the purpose, PGT uses a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) which has shown the best performance in encoding session-based sequential data [5] where a session is a set of consecutive behaviors of a user. PGT combines the hidden states of BiLSTM by an attention network using the global temporal preference as context (details in Sect. 3.3).PGT then generates a prediction vector using a fully-connected neural network where information from both of personal preference and global temporal preference at time t is fed into. Lastly, PGT ranks candidate articles based on the similarity between the embedding vectors of the candidates and the generated prediction vector.",

We propose an attention-based network architecture to dynamically control weights of features in 1) the representation of global temporal preference, and 2) the representation of personal preference. The global temporal preference vector is used as context in the attention network for the personal preference. Attention helps PGT effectively deal with a quick change of personal preference in the online news ecosystem.Experiment.

However, these methods usually suffer from the cold-start problems. To deal with the cold-start problems, several studies enrich the embedding of newly published articles by utilizing the meta-information of articles [4]. Okura et al. [11] proposed a news recommender system based on variational autoencoder (VAE) and RNN. They used a method based on VAE to learn embedding vectors of articles, such that vectors in the same categories are made similar. After learning article embeddings, they used RNNs to predict the next article vector that a user is likely to watch. Park et al. [12] proposed a news recommendation system based on RNN to model each user\u2019s personal preference. They reranked the candidates by each user\u2019s long-term categorical preference which is the weighted sum of categories of news articles that the user has seen; this categorical preference improved the accuracy.",

This method aggregates outputs of two heterogeneous methods which are 1) user-item matrix factorization to model the interaction between users and items, and 2) attention-based recurrent network to trace the interest of each user.NPA [17].

We also propose an attention based architecture to effectively deal with changes of users\u2019 personal preferences, with regard to the global temporal preference.
