            "text": "The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic structure that allows important cellular processes, such as cell division, movement, distribution of organelles, endo- and exocytosis and intercellular communication (Pollard and Cooper, 2009). Its organization mainly relies on assembly and disassembly of actin, which is driven by an extensive catalog of regulatory proteins. Rho-family GTPases are small monomeric G proteins that fluctuate between inactive and active states, depending on their binding to either GDP or GTP (Bustelo et al., 2007). Members of this family are responsible for regulating several processes of the cytoskeleton dynamics, including actin polymerization/depolymerization and formation of high-order actin structures (Blanchoin et al., 2014; Bustelo et al., 2007). Among the small GTPases, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 represent the most widely distributed and best-characterized members. Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins control actin organization during the formation of cell membrane protrusions; Rac1 improves actin polymerization on the periphery of the cell surface producing lamellipodia or membrane ruffles, while Cdc42 regulates the formation of filopodia (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002). RhoA promotes the formation of stress fibers and of complexes associated to focal adhesions (Hall, 1998). Furthermore, the actin filaments are elongated by other cellular proteins such as members of the formins family, as Diaph, the Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and cortactin, while proteins such as gelsolin and cofilin improve actin depolymerization (Carlier et al., 1997; DesMarais et al., 2004; Goode and Eck, 2007; Weisswange et al., 2009). Profilin, another member of the formins family, promotes both processes, contributing to the assembly and disassembly of the actin filament, enhancing its turnover (Didry et al., 1998). Besides, the actin filaments can form networks through proteins such as Actn4 and fimbrin, which allow the formation of contractile fibers and structures such as cortical actin (Bretscher, 1981; Djinovic-Carugo et al., 1999). Not surprisingly, viruses have developed strategies to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton, especially by manipulating the Rho-protein signaling system to successfully infect cells (Taylor et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Rotaviruses, major etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis in children under three years of age, are non-enveloped virus particles whose capsid is composed of three concentric layers of protein that surround the viral genome, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 and the capping enzyme VP3 (Estes and Greenberg, 2013). The innermost layer is constituted by the viral protein VP2, while the intermediate layer is formed by VP6. VP7 forms the surface protein layer from which trimers of VP4 are projected forming the viral spikes. VP4 can be cleaved by trypsin into two subunits, VP5* and VP8*, and this cleavage is required for the virus to enter cells (Arias et al., 1996; Estes et al., 1981). Although considerable information about different stages of the rotavirus life cycle, like entry, transcription and translation, viroplasm formation, morphogenesis, genome replication, maturation and release has been obtained, the role of the actin cytoskeleton in rotavirus infection has been poorly characterized. A recent study described the actin-binding protein Drebrin1 as a restriction factor for rotavirus infection (Li et al., 2017), and it has been reported that changes in microfilaments occur at early (Zambrano et al., 2012) and late (Gardet et al., 2006) times of rotavirus infection; it has also been shown that rotavirus release from polarized and non-polarized cells is sensitive to the action of drugs that disrupt actin filaments (Gardet et al., 2007; Trejo-Cerro et al., 2018). However, the potential role of microfilaments in virus entry and genome replication has not been explored. Of interest, in this work, we show that the small GTPase Cdc42, as well as alpha-actinin 4 (Actn4) and Diaph, are required for rotavirus internalization in MA104 cells, and that Rac1 facilitates viral genome replication.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, Rac1 seems to be required in a step subsequent to virus entry, since the decrease in virus infectivity was maintained when DLPs were transfected. Of interest, the infectivity of RRV was not affected when DLPs were transfected into cells treated with siRNAs to Actn4, Cdc42 or Diaph, indicating that rotavirus requires these cell proteins to efficiently enter MA104 cells, although the recovery of infectivity was less pronounced in cells where the expression of Diaph was silenced as compared to cells transfected with siRNAs to either Actn4 or Cdc42.",

The first step involves the interaction of rotavirus with cell binding receptors (L\u00f3pez and Arias, 2006). Actn4, Cdc42 and Diaph have mainly a cytoplasmic distribution, although Actn4 can be found at focal adhesion contacts, and Cdc42 can be localized at the plasma membrane (Aksenova et al., 2013; Oceguera-Yanez et al., 2005). Since these three cellular proteins appear to be important for rotavirus cell entry, we determined the entry step during which they are required. For this, the ability of the virus to bind to MA104 cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA or with siRNAs directed to either Actn4, Cdc42 or Diaph was initially tested. The ability of the virus to bind to Rac1-silenced cells was also explored in this assay. The siRNA-transfected cells were incubated with purified RRV TLPs (MOI = 50) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, and then the cells were washed twice to remove the free, unbound virus, and the cell-bound virus was detected by an ELISA as previously reported (Zarate et al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 3\nA, RRV cell surface binding was not affected by knocking down the expression of Actn4, Cdc42 or Diaph, indicating that these proteins might be required during virus entry, but at a post-binding step. Furthermore, as expected, knocking down the expression of Rac1 did not affect virus binding (Fig. 3A).",

The cells were then washed twice to remove the unbound virus, and they were then shifted to 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow the virus to enter cells. The virus that did not enter the cells, and was thus still bound to the cell surface, was removed by exhaustive EGTA washes and afterwards the cells were lysed and the RNA was extracted, and viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR. Interestingly, as shown Fig. 3B, the internalization of the virus was restricted to about 50% in cells where the expression of both Actn4 and Cdc42 was knocked down. This reduction in the amount of internalized viral RNA is similar to the reduction of infectivity observed under the same conditions (Fig. 1A), strongly suggesting that in MA104 cells Actn4 and Cdc42 are important for the virus to be internalized. The internalization data for virus in Diaph-silenced cells was not as clear-cut, since although a tendency for a reduced virus internalization was observed in these cells, the data shown in Fig. 3B did not reach a statistically significant value, suggesting that in these cells the virus might be only partially internalized. As expected, in cells transfected with the siRNA to Rac1 the internalization of the virus was not affected, serving also as an excellent negative control for the assay.",

At 6 h post-infection the cells were lysed, and the viral gene 10 positive-sense RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR as described above.

Since the involvement of Rac1 in the virus replication cycle is at a post-entry step, we evaluated if its cellular distribution is modified by the virus infection. As can be seen in Fig. 4C, its cellular localization does not seem to be affected in virus-infected cells, what it is not surprising considering its role as a regulatory protein that probably benefits virus replication through an indirect, regulatory mechanism.",

The activities of formins include the formation of actin networks, cell migration, adhesion and intracellular trafficking (Goode and Eck, 2007). Our results showed that knocking down the expression of this protein reduces rotavirus infectivity; however, this block in infectivity was overcome by transfecting DLPs, suggesting that Diaph might have a role during rotavirus entry. In this regard, Diaph has been reported to be present in endosomes where it coordinates with the Arp2/3 complex to promote the formation of the endosome actin coat (Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005). Altogether, these observations suggest the possibility that RhoA might act in concert to Diaph to help rotavirus entry during the endocytic transport.",

Interestingly, it has been described that Cdc42 is important for the cell entry of other RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (Krzyzaniak et al., 2013), coronaviruses (Swaine and Dittmar, 2015), and Ebola virus (Quinn et al., 2009). It has also been reported that Cdc42 regulates the endocytic process (Symons and Rusk, 2003), and studies with hepatitis C virus and dengue virus serotype 2 have shown that this cellular protein could facilitate the movement of the virus to interact with the viral receptor and the formation of filopodia, leading to virus entry (Brazzoli et al., 2008; Zamudio-Meza et al., 2009). Considering that rotavirus entry into cells does not seem to involve the formation of protrusions such as macropinocytosis (Gutierrez et al., 2010), a different signaling pathway, such as Cdc42-WASP-Arp2/3, could be involved in this process, especially since the WASP protein was found to also facilitate rotavirus infection (Silva-Ayala et al., unpublished results). It is known that WASP, a downstream protein effector of Cdc42, is involved in the formation of the membrane curvature that occurs during the progression of endocytosis (Tsujita et al., 2006), thus, we hypothesize that the activated Cdc42 interacts with WASP and the Arp2/3 complex, to help promoting rotavirus entry. In this regard, we have previously found that the dominant-negative mutant Cdc42N17 reduced rotavirus infectivity, while the constitutively active variant Cdc42V12 had no effect (Silva-Ayala et al., 2013).",

Of interest, among the diverse functions of the members of the Rho family, is their role in regulation and assembly of cell junctions (Citi et al., 2014). RhoA, mainly through Diaph activation and Cdc42, are essential during initial formation, maintenance and remodeling of adherens and tight junctions (Fukuhara et al., 2003; Sahai and Marshall, 2002). Since it has been reported that rotavirus requires JAM-A, occludin and ZO-1 for entry into MA104 cells (Torres-Flores et al., 2015), it is possible that Cdc42 and RhoA could improve rotavirus internalization through their influence on the tight junction establishment. A recent study by Soliman et al. supports this last hypothesis; they demonstrated that RhoA/Rock signaling is modulated by rotavirus, disrupting tight junctions integrity to enter cells (Soliman et al., 2018). Further studies are necessary, however, to determine the mechanisms involved, and how these GTPases regulate these cellular pathways.",

The localization of Actn4 in tight junctions and stress fibers has also been reported (Honda et al., 1998).

            "text": "Rac1 is a multifunctional protein involved in several cellular processes, as cell motility, polarity, adherens junction formation and membrane ruffles induction (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002). In this work we found that Rac1 is required for maximal viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 4). The cellular distribution of Rac1 was not modified in rotavirus-infected cells as compared to uninfected cells, and neither co-localization with viroplasms (Fig. 4C) nor a decrease of viroplasm number in Rac1 knocked-down cells were observed (data not shown). These data suggest that Rac1 might act through the regulation of other cellular proteins, which in turn might promote viral RNA production. Interestingly, it has described that inhibition of JNK and p38 protein kinases decreases rotavirus replication in Caco-2 and MA104 cells (Holloway and Coulson, 2006) and, importantly, Rac1 regulates this pathway acting upstream of JNK/p38 activation (Coso et al., 1995; Turkson et al., 1999). Since our data suggest that Rac1 is required for rotavirus genome replication, it can be hypothesized that this process is facilitated through activation of this signaling pathway. On the other hand, a role for the PI3K-Akt-mTor signaling pathway may also be envisaged, since a recent report showed that blocking this pathway inhibits rotavirus replication (Yin et al., 2018), and Rac1 acts as downstream effector of PI3K (Liu et al., 2004). In addition, since the important role of Rac1 in cytoskeleton regulation, it cannot be discarded that cellular proteins required for viral RNA production are transported to viral replication centers through a Rac1-regulated actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Since Rac1 is involved in many cellular pathways, further studies are required to elucidate which specific signaling pathway(s) are implicated in rotavirus RNA synthesis. Of interest, and other viruses, such as oncolytic Newcastle disease virus, hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 have been also shown to require Rac1 to promote their replication (Lu et al., 1996; Puhlmann et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2008).",
