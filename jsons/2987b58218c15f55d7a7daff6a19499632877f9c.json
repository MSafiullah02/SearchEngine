In studies that have used the formula 327 of fatal cases/(fatal + recovered) to calculate fatality rates, these have been found to be higher, 328 estimated at 14% among hospitalised patients (74). 329 330 However, when considering all cases of SARS-CoV infection, including those that are not 331 hospitalised, it is likely that the vast majority of mild cases are undocumented and therefore not 332 included in calculations of case fatality rate -which would render it significantly lower than 333 previously believed (57). With these factors complicating estimations of case fatality rate, it is 334 difficult to determine a precise risk, but recent estimates taking these factors into account put the 335 case fatality rate at 0.51% (75). This is supported by data from cruise ship cohorts. Of cases from 336 the Diamond Princess, a population in which many of the case-finding difficulties were eliminated, 337 studies recorded the case fatality rate at 0.99% (76). 338 339 Despite this uncertainty regarding the precise case fatality rates, it does appear clear that there are 340 several significant risk factors for fatal illness. In early analysis of Chinese data, the risk of death 341 was higher with increasing age, climbing to 8% among 70-79 year-olds and 14.8% among those 342 \u226580 years (62). This was supported by data from Italy (77) where the higher fatality rate was 343 associated with an older population (with 23% of Italy being \u226565 years) and age-specific death 344 rates rose to 20.2% among those \u226580 years and 22.7% among \u226590 years. Likewise, in some studies 345 of hospitalised patients age was associated with disease severity where the risk of severe disease COVID-19 mortality risk has also been consistently associated with comorbidities (6, 8). In Wu's 350 analysis, it rose from 2.3% in the general population to 10.5% among those with cardiovascular 351 diseases, 7.3% among patients with diabetes mellitus, 6.3% among those with chronic respiratory 352 diseases, 6% among patients with hypertension and 5.6% in cancer patients (63). A subset of fatal 353 cases from Italy have been reported in which 99.2% had comorbidities of some description, with 354 48.5% having at least three underlying diseases (77).

Compared to European populations, East Asian populations were found to 363 have a higher allele frequency of the ACE2 variant, associated with higher expression of ACE2 364receptors(82). This suggests that East Asian and China population might have an increased 365 susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to European individuals. In contrast, Cai(83) 366found no difference in the expression level of ACE2 between Asians and Caucasians. Among 367 genders, a study byZhou et al. (84)  found that Chinese males expressed higher levels of ACE2 368receptors. These findings are preliminary and inconclusive but they do warrant furtherFor the majority of patients, COVID-19 presents as a mild illness that can be managed at home 373 with rest and simple analgesics/antipyretics for symptom relief(Figure 1). Paracetamol has been 374 suggested as the drug of choice for symptom relief while anecdotal evidence of NSAID-associated 375 harm in COVID-19 infected patients is being investigated (85). Glucocorticoids, previously used 376 in SARS, have been found to be harmful in influenza and MERS-CoV; the CDC and WHO 377 currently recommend against their use for COVID-19 (58). 378 379Currently, most healthcare facilities are attempting to manage milder cases of COVID-19 on an 380 outpatient basis, with patients self-isolating in their own homes.
