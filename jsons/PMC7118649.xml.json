In the course of development of livestock industry, the health of replacement progeny calves is an important component of total operation profitability as the heifer calf is the foundation of the future herd [1]. However, calves are usually neglected as they do not bring any immediate financial return and the cost of their maintenance considerably adds to the production cost of milk. Pneumonia is associated with high morbidity and mortality of calves and incurs great economic losses to the farmers due to the losses by death, treatment costs, reduced growth and productivity [2]. It is estimated that calf mortality of 20% can reduce the net profit of an enterprise by 40% [3].",

Besides, bovine rhinovirus, bovine reovirus and Influenza A viruses have also been reported occasionally to be associated with pneumonia in calves [9,10]. Moreover, sepsis and bacteriemia due to E. coli, Salmonella dublin, Streptococcal spp. or Staphylococcal spp. are also responsible for the development of pneumonia in the dairy calves [11]. Viruses are the primary pathogens and are generally detected during an early phase of pneumonia, and in the later stages, the bacterial infection becomes more predominant [12]. Respiratory viruses like BRSV and BPI-3 initiate primary damage to the upper respiratory tract and lungs, causing suppression of the local immune defense mechanism, which may facilitate rapid bacterial multiplication leading to acute to chronic pneumonia in a synergistic manner [13].",

The BPI-3, a negative sense RNA virus of Respirovirus genus under Paramyxoviridae family, contributes to tissue damage and immunosuppression in stressed calves resulting in severe bronchopneumonia from secondary bacterial infection.

PCR amplicons for BRSV and BPI-3 yielded 246 bp (Fig. 1\na) and 127bp (Fig. 1b) products, respectively. In the positive cases of BRSV, grossly, lungs were consolidated cranio-ventrally with deep red atelectatic and collapsed areas with a rubbery consistency. Beside cranio-ventral consolidation, varying degrees of emphysema and edema in the diaphragmatic lobes with occasional deposition of fibrin on the pleura were observed (Fig. 2\na). Mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes were swollen and edematous, and trachea had frothy exudate in the majority of cases. Microscopically, BRSV infection was associated with typical lesions of bronchointerstitial pneumonia in ten cases, interstitial pneumonia in one case and fibrinous bronchopneumonia in one case. Characteristic findings of bronchiolar epithelial necrosis with thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells having intracytoplasmic inclusion were found (Fig. 2b&2c) in numerous lung sections. Interlobular septae were widened by edema and dilation of lymphatic vessels in the majority of cases. The tracheal section showed mild to moderate congestion and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In one case, trachea had hemorrhages in the lamina propria and necrosis of the submucosal gland (Fig.2e). There were depletion and necrosis of lymphoid follicles, congestion and edema of medullary sinuses with fibrin intermixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells (Fig. 2f) and occasional neutrophils and bacterial colonies in mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. We observed immunopositivity in all twelve animals for BRSV by dFAT which were positive by RT-PCR. The BRSV antigen was distributed in the cytoplasm of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells. The apple green immunostaining in the epithelium was the mostly granular type (Fig. 2d).",

In the present study, the frequency of BRSV detection was determined to be 2.95% (12/406) by RT-PCR which is lower as compared to the earlier seroprevalence reports of BRSV from India. This is because of repeated exposure of adult animals vis-\u00e0-vis calves to the virus infection throughout their life as well as possibility of re-infections [28].

The observations are in concordance with the earlier findings of [29] and [27]. Microscopically, characteristic lesions of bronchointerstitial pneumonia were observed in ten cases and few were diagnosed as fibrinous bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia. Similar findings were also reported by [30] and [14]. The presence of bronchointerstitial pneumonia with multinucleated syncytia and inclusions in the present study are in consonance with the findings of [31] in the BRSV affected animals. It is because of the replication of the virus in the alveolar macrophages and F glycoprotein induces fusion of the infected cells, formation of syncytia and spreads to the adjacent cells [32]. BRSV is a known primary pathogen associated with initial damage to the lung tissues and subsequent colonization with bacterial pathogens as also reported earlier [33]. BRSV has a special predilection to ciliated bronchiolar epithelium, it\u2019s attachment to the ciliated epithelial cells is mediated by the heparin binding domains on G glycoprotein [34]. Findings of fibrinous bronchopneumonia with the presence of fibrinous exudate with inflammatory cells and interstitial pneumonia were in accordance with earlier reports [23]. It may be due to the release of a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the infected cell, recruiting neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages to the affected area (Caswell and Williams, 2016). The BRSV antigen was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells as observed previously [35,36]; Ceribasi et al., 2014) [35,36]. reported 19.5% (7/41) incidence by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) in young cattle from Brazil. All the four sequences of partial fragment of BRSV were closely related to sequences from Belgium, Brazil, USA and UK [[37], [38], [39], [40]] and distantly related to selected BRSV sequences from Denmark, Czech Republic and France [[41], [42], [43]]. Although amplicons size was very small and the small number of samples evaluated in the study, the obtained data suggest that BRSV is circulating in India among the bovine population.",

In India, there are few reports of BPI-3 associated sero-prevalence of 27.81% [18] and 57.58% [19] in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, respectively. Variable incidence of BPI-3 has been reported as 13% and 14.81% by [45] and [23]; respectively in young cattle from North America and Ireland. In the present study, an incidence of 3.69 % of BPI-3 was observed by RT-PCR from pneumonic young cattle and buffaloes which could be due to selection of younger animals and their less exposure to the viral agents.",

            "text": "Grossly, BPI-3 positive lungs were associated with focal to multifocal consolidation of cranio-ventral lobes with the firm to a rubbery consistency and emphysema/edema in the diaphragmatic lobes leading to failure of the lungs to collapse. The observations are in agreement with those of earlier descriptions [46]. Histologically, they were diagnosed mostly as bronchointerstitial pneumonia in six cases, interstitial pneumonia in four cases, fibrinous bronchopneumonia in two cases and suppurative bronchopneumonia in three cases. Similar findings were also described by [47]. Presence of thickened alveolar septa, atelectasis, infiltration of lymphocytes and formation of syncytial cells and intracytoplasmic inclusions in the alveolar lumen observed in the present study were similar to the findings of Cerabasi et al. (2014) in spontaneous cases. The presence of inclusion bodies is attributed to the replication of the virus in the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelium and alveolar macrophages. BPI-3 has an immunosuppressive effect on the leucocytes as it inhibits the formation of phagolysosomes and increases the production of arachidonic acid metabolites, thereby inhibiting phagocytosis by the alveolar macrophages [10]. It also destroys the mucociliary system [48]. These mechanisms lead to the suboptimal mucociliary escalator and depressed local cellular immune response which is may be the reason for the development of severe lesions of fibrinous and suppurative bronchopneumonia observed in the present study. BPI-3 antigen was found in the cytoplasm of bronchiolar, alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells using d-FAT. This result ties well with Cerabasi et al., (2014) who located the BPI-3 antigen by using dFAT and found the incidence of 10.53% (26/247). Amplified single BPI-3 fragment was sequenced and analyzed with already available BPI-3 sequences at the NCBI database to confirm the disease. It was closely related to the BPI-3 sequences from the USA, Egypt and Japan [[49], [50], [51]]. This confirms the circulation BPI-3 in the Indian bovine population. Moreover, further studies with considering larger fragments and the complete genome are needed to identify various strain and genotype circulating in the country. This will help to design preventive strategies and develop appropriate diagnostics.",
