This feature 62 is being investigated not only using clinical trials and data [2-7], statistical tools [2,4,6-8], and 63 medical interviews with patients [2,3,5-7], but also through the mathematical point of view. 64 Concerning mathematical predictions of SARS-CoV-2 reproductive patterns, the maximum 65 possible rate of infection of the virus and human daily life [2,9,10] among countries are 66 presenting community spreading with an increasing margin of probability and statistical 67 unpredictable outcomes. One of the unpredictable patterns (Figure 1) of the virus in its spread 68 within the period of February to April 2020 is visible in the numbers of new infections among 69 countries over time where the input and output, which is the possible number of people 70 infected from an initial number, resulting into a maximum and minimum margins of spread of 71 the virus fluctuation, express unpredictably (non-linearity). This observation was initially and 72 briefly modeled by the nonlinear method reported by Gu et al. [11]. : medRxiv preprint doubling of cases by day range and the large variance of input data for the evolution of each 76 system. Source: Our World in Data. 77 Considering these nonlinear aspects of infection among countries, this article research 78 during March and April [12,13,14] pointed to the airborne long-range transmission evidences of 79 SARS-CoV-2 infection and this environmental role of infection was supported by the type of 80 policies adopted in China and South Korea where significant reduction of infection cases 81 occurred with distinct patterns found in other countries during all epidemics contagion phase. 82 Regarding this two countries policies, social distancing measures with additional methods such 83 as mask use and city disinfection were applied and this research found it as one main cause of 84 COVID-19 non trivial frequency of daily new cases distribution during early stage of pandemics 85 until end of April.

Methodology 108 2.1. Empirical evidence of instability for COVID-19 transmission: social isolation and social distancing 109 differences 110 Recent studies reported that the transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the 111 proximity of other humans and social interactions within a set of empirical variables including 112 the most basic forms of human behavior such as droplets in coughs, sneezes, handshakes, 113 clothes, cups, general touching, and general objects-sharing behaviors [1,4,15,16]. This set of 114 variables together with environmental factors of the virus's possible transmission on the ground 115 (surfaces) and in air (not only aerosol in medical facilities, but aerosol and biosols formation 116 under atmospheric conditions for outside places) can also impacts transmission; therefore, 117 generating new patterns for the course epidemiology [9]. This new pattern of virus transmission 118 through aerosols was confirmed by the WHO in terms of a situation occurring at medical 119 facilities [17] and also as stated by van Doremalen et al. [18], the upper and lower respiratory 120 tracts in humans produce infection in the nearby atmosphere, propagating virus through the 121 air, measured experimentally for about three hours during an experiment, and presenting low : medRxiv preprint infection reduction at time of infectious titre from 10 3.5 to 10 2.7 TCID50 ( tissue-culture-infective-123 dose) for SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2. This overcoming and not 124 predefined measure for an epidemic prevention demands alternative scientific hypotheses and 125 further probabilistic and statistical frameworks needed to establish new policies and individual 126 preventive actions. 127 This article new experimental research design provided an important approach to possible 128 social distancing policies limitations due to no social transmission isolation of the virus, leading 129 to the social distancing criteria of a physical distance between individuals with possible failures 130 since air could lead to an unsuspected form of virus constant reproduction. The instability 131 property could be visible when some countries in the adopted policy to contain virus spreading, 132 fail to achieve this result, due to asymptotic instability between virus potential to infect 133 individuals beyond this policy measures and methodology adopted. This feature has a wider 134 domain of probability distributions assuming distinct patterns of occurrence [9,10,15] as 135 observed in many countries [1], and also possibly contributing to the framework analysis of 136 starting symptoms and final clinical consequences [4,6,7,19]. This observation was noted as the 137 possible reason for the constant daily new cases and the community spreading of the disease 138 that, even with preventive methods such as social isolation (lockdown or shelter in place) and 139 COVID-19 testing, continued growing with exponential and unpredictable patterns are 140 occurring. 141 The official pre-assumed forms of social distancing measures to avoid transmission and the 142 possible new patterns of atmospheric disease factor may present a not yet observed continuous 143 (not discretized) form of transmission (partially unpredictable) due airborne instability 144 properties.
