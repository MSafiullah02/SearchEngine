Based on pathogenic, biochemical, and geographical profiles, F. tularensis is classified into four subspecies: tularensis, holarctica, mediasiatica, and novicida1. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, isolated predominantly in North America, is one of the most infectious bacteria with a minimum infective dose to human as low as 10 colony forming unit (CFU)2\u20134. If an appropriate antibiotic is not timely administered, the mortality rate is 5% to 30%5. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, thus it is considered a potential threat as a biological weapon. However, at present, there is no suitable vaccine against tularemia.",

The first vaccine for tularemia was a heat-killed F. tularensis produced by Lee Foshay in 19307. During the Second World War, live attenuated vaccines were developed and found to be protective8. In 1956, ampoules of a viable mixture of attenuated tularemia vaccine were transferred to the United States from the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology Imeni N. F. Gamaleia (Gamaleia Institute) in the former Soviet Union by Shope8. From this mixture, a strain of the attenuated phenotype was selected, evaluated for safety, and designated as F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS)9. In human volunteers, the LVS was found to protect against the intracutaneous challenge of SCHU S4 but not against respiratory challenge3,10. More recently, various mutant strains based on LVS against F. tularensis (such as \u0394SodB11 and \u0394dsbA12), F. novicida (such as \u0394IglD13 and \u0394iglB14), and F. tularensis strain SCHU S4 (such as \u0394clpB15 and \u0394ggt16) were found to be attenuated with some protective capacity against the virulent strain SCHU S4 in mice or rats. However, there is currently no licensed vaccine against tularemia17. Thus, development of a safe and efficacious tularemia vaccine is still crucial.",

Among these animal models to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine, macaques develop clinical signs of pulmonary infection, quite similar to those in humans due to their close genetic backgrounds19\u201321. Tularemia outbreaks in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis)22 and rhesus (Macaca mulatta)23 macaques have also been reported. Previous studies have reported that macaques died 5 to 11 days post-challenge (dpc) with a virulent strain. The target organs in macaques and humans include the lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes21,22,24. Thus, a macaque model is well-suited to study the pathogenesis of tularemia and develop countermeasures in humans3,10. In fact, macaque models were used to evaluate the pathogenicity of tularemia pathogenicity in the early 1970s24\u201328 and to evaluate candidate tularemia vaccines in the 1960s29\u201332. The cynomolgus macaque is a better model of inhalation tularemia than the rhesus macaque33, as the pathology of cynomolgus macaques infected with aerosolized F. tularensis is similar to those observed in human inhalation tularemia20. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the virulent strain SCHU S4 in cynomolgus macaque is approximately 20 CFU via aerosol infection10,33.",

A previous study reported that the \u2206pdpC mutant strain had the potential to protect mice from lethal intranasal challenge with a virulent strain via subcutaneous immunization34. The pdpC gene of the virulent strain SCHU P9 was disrupted by group II intron insertion using the TargeTron gene knockout system37,38 to generate the \u0394pdpC mutant strain39. Thus, the genetic stability of strain \u2206pdpC was confirmed by in vivo passages in mice for 10 generations34. These data suggest that the mutant strain \u0394pdpC is a promising vaccine candidate for tularemia. To further evaluate the possibility of \u0394pdpC as a candidate tularemia vaccine, a lethal cynomolgus macaque model was employed in this study to analyze a protective potential of \u0394pdpC.",

The virulent strain SCHU was obtained by the Ohara Research Laboratory, Ohara General Hospital (Fukushima, Japan) from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Hamilton, MT, USA) in 195842. Then, the virulence of strain SCHU was attenuated by 373 passages on pig liver glucose hemoglobin agar medium over a period of 30 years42. The attenuated SCHU strain was kindly provided by Dr. H. Fujita (Ohara Research Laboratory) in 2002. In Japan, it is difficult to obtain strain SCHU S4 from foreign laboratories because the transport of the bacterium is highly regulated under the Japanese infectious disease control laws. We recently isolated a virulent SCHU strain (referred to as SCHU P9) from the attenuated SCHU strain after 9 passages in mice39. Strain SCHU P9 has the same parental original strain as strain SCHU S4, and its virulence in mice was shown to be comparable to that of SCHU S439.",

Our previous study showed that the LD50 of the virulent strain SCHU P9 in mice was comparable to that of strain SCHU S4; thus, the LD50 of the virulent strain SCHU P9 in cynomolgus macaques was considered to be similar to that of strain SCHU S4.

Based on these reports, an intratracheal infective dose of 106 CFU of SCHU P9 of no less than 1,000 LD50 was used in this study. Two monkeys in Group 2 that were challenged intratracheally with 106 CFU of SCHU P9 without prevaccination developed severe tularemia and were euthanized at 7 or 11 dpc. Two monkeys in Group 1 that were vaccinated subcutaneously with the mutant strain \u2206pdpC had survived for 21 dpc with the virulent strain SCHU P9, strongly indicating that subcutaneous vaccination with strain \u0394pdpC is effective against lethal infection with a virulent strain of F. tularensis.",

As a potential agent of bioterrorism, the animals in this study were experimentally inoculated with F. tularensis intranasally or intratracheally. After inoculation, the bacteria arrive in the alveolar airspace and are immediately phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and inactivated in phagolysosomes. However, F. tularensis can replicate efficiently in macrophages. In addition, Faron et al. recently demonstrated that virulent F. tularensis strains can efficiently replicate in alveolar AT-II cells both in vitro and in vivo43\u201345. Therefore, we tried to confirm the infection of alveolar macrophages and AT-II cells in the lungs of cynomolgus macaques. For immunohistochemical analysis of cynomolgus macaque, CD68, which is expressed specifically by monocytes, is often used to identify macrophages. AT-II cells in the lungs, which can be identified using Abs against angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), play a key role in the homeostasis in the renin\u2013angiotensin system. In this study, the infection of alveolar macrophages and AT-II cells in cynomolgus macaque were confirmed using Abs against CD68 and ACE2, respectively, accompanied with Abs against F. tularensis LPS. The infected macrophages, which were double stained with anti-CD68 and anti\u2013F. tularensis LPS Abs, were found in the lungs of the monkeys in Group 2 (Fig. 5A). Simultaneously, the infected AT-II cells that were double stained with anti-ACE2 and anti\u2013F. tularensis LPS Abs were also observed in the lungs (Fig. 5C). These findings were first confirmed in nonhuman primates and strongly suggest that F. tularensis efficiently infects and replicates in AT-II cells after respiratory inoculation in vivo, as reported by several researchers43\u201345. Thus, it is likely that infected AT-II cells, as well as the infected macrophages, play a crucial role in the development of severe tularemia pneumonia.",

The induction of F. tularensis-specific Abs was also detected with the MA test (Fig. 7C) and WB analysis (Fig. 7D,E). It has been reported that when infected by F. tularensis by inhalation, serum Abs contribute to protecting against tularemia by preventing the spread of bacteria from the lungs to the liver and spleen while facilitating rapid bacterial clearance in the lung, which offers a considerable survival advantage46,48. The Ab titer in animal #4552 had increased after vaccination with strain \u2206pdpC, as compared to animal #4550. Animal #4552 had no symptoms of tularemia, whereas the body weight of animal #4550 had decreased (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the stronger Ab response induced in animal #4552 contributed to protection against tularemia. The difference in protective immunity between these two animals may be due to differences in genetic backgrounds. In fact, vaccine testing in humans showed different protection effects among individual volunteers from asymptomatic to mild to severe3,10,49. In animal #4550, however, although all bacteria were not cleared from the trachea and lungs (Fig. 6), bacterial growth was limited in these organs, indicating a protective effect inhibiting the spread of the bacteria to other organs and tissues.",

            "text": "The protective effect of Ab generally supports the neutralization of bacterial infectivity and the lysis of the bacterial membrane by the complement system. However, F. tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can replicate in multiple types of eukaryotic cells including phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Since the Ab is not able to directly react with the intracellular bacteria, the cellular immune responses might be also important to restrict the intracellular replication in F. tularensis, as well as humoral immune responses. For example, cytotoxicity T cells (CTL) playing a central role in cellular immune responses were indispensable for the escape from lethal infection of intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes50 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis51. Several reports have shown that IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) that could evoke cellular immune responses were indispensable to prevent lethal infection in F. tularensis52\u201354. However, it was uncertain that CTL could contribute to restricting the bacterial replication in F. tularensis. In this study, PBMCs collected at 0 dpc (before challenge) were applied to IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay (Fig. 8A). The abundant IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells were detected in the PBMCs of the animals #4550 and #4552 in Group 1. Especially, the highest level of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells in PBMCs and the Ab responses were induced in the animal #4552 among the six animals (Fig. 8B). Since animal #4552 did not show any clinical signs at all (Fig. 2), it might be suggested that the synergy between cellular and humoral immune responses contributed to the forceful prevention from the lethal challenge of SCHU P9.",

Similarly, because high levels of MA test titers in two animals in Group 1 (animal #4550 and #4552) were confirmed at 3 weeks post vaccination in this study, the two animals were intratracheally challenged with virulent strain SCHU P9 at 3 weeks post-vaccination. The specific T cells stimulated by the strain SCHU P9 antigen were confirmed in animals #4450 and #4552 in Group 1 by performing the ELISPOT assay. Moreover, abundant IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells without the stimulation were also shown in the PBMCs of animal #4552 in Group 1 (Fig. 8A) because of the elevated immune responses that continued for up to 3 weeks post vaccination. These findings suggest that the elevated immune response contributed to survival from the lethal challenge in animal #4552 in Group 1. Conversely, it would have been preferable to have increased the time until the challenge to evaluate the acquired immune responses in accordance with previous reports of macaques that were challenged with the virulent strain at 1 and 2 months post vaccination13,30.",
