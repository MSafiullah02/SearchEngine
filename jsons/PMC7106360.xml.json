            "text": "Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI) in young children and causes serious lower RTI in children younger than six years of age [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. The diagnosis of HBoV1 infections has traditionally been based on qualitative PCRs detecting viral DNA. Recent studies have however shown that the clinical value of this approach is low due to persistence of HBoV1 DNA in the airways, leading to frequent detection of low concentrations in healthy children [[6], [7], [8]]. Clinical specificity of HBoV1 mRNA detection has been shown to be superior to that of HBoV1 DNA detection [6,9,10]. Detection of HBoV1 antigen is another diagnostic approach. An automated HBoV1 antigen test based on immunometric detection has recently been developed and has shown promise in preliminary studies [11]. Antigen detection is well suited for automation and point-of-care diagnostics, and may be beneficial to making an HBoV1 diagnosis by providing rapid and specific results.",

It is an immunoassay based on separation-free two-photon excitation fluorometry and targets the HBoV1 capsid protein VP3 [12]. The mariPOC test reports strong positive samples in 20 min while low-positive and negative results are confirmed in 2 h. For mariPOC, NPSs were diluted in 1.3 mL of mariPOC RTI sample buffer for rapid prospective on-site testing on a random-access immunoassay analyzer. The test was in routine use at the Pediatric Emergency Department of Turku University Hospital for rapid point-of-care diagnostics of RTI throughout the study period. According to local guidelines, the mariPOC antigen test is used for all children hospitalized with acute RTI. This Pediatric Emergency Department serves a population of 70 000 children or adolescents (<16 years of age) and receives patients mostly by referral from primary care clinics. The majority of children hospitalized with RTIs are younger than 5 years of age and have lower RTIs.",

However, sera were not obtained from the children included in this study. Instead, we used mRNA detection and high DNA load as the basis for calculating specificities, sensitivities and PPVs. mRNA is a marker of actively transcribing virus during an ongoing infection, and a rapidly declining DNA load is the normal outcome after an acute infection. The HBoV1 mRNA test has performed well in studies, providing support for its use as reference [6,7,9,10]. Furthermore, a high DNA load (>104 or >106 copies/mL) in nasopharyngeal secretions has been shown to be a better diagnostic criterion than mere DNA detection by endpoint PCR [8,[14], [15], [16]]. The two tests together should therefore form a good basis for evaluating the antigen test.",

Compared with two independent reference assays, this antigen test shows substantially higher clinical specificity and PPV than the commonly used HBoV1 qualitative DNA PCRs. The sensitivity of the HBoV1 antigen test is lower than those of the PCRs, but it has the advantage of being a rapid test available for point-of-care use, with positive results usually available in 20 min, resulting in a faster diagnosis than traditional methods. This makes the test attractive for emergency room and outpatient use. A supplementary test, measuring HBoV1 DNA load, mRNA or specific antibodies, will be of value for higher sensitivity in an inpatient setting.",
