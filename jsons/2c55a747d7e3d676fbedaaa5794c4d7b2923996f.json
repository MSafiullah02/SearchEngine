The model is described by a system of integrodifferential equations. Parameters of our model directly related to epidemiological data. We derive some analytical results, as well as perform numerical simulations. We use the proposed model to analyze COVID-19 epidemic data in Armenia. We propose a strategy: organize a quarantine, and then conduct extensive testing of risk groups during the quarantine, evaluating the percentage of the population among risk groups and people with symptoms.",

Later, Kermack and McKendrick [2] proposed their prominent theory for infectious disease dynamics, which influenced the following SIR and related models. By the end of the last century, significant progress in the field was made (a systematic literature review for this period is presented in Anderson and May's book [3] ). The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn the attention of researchers from all over the world and different areas to epidemic modeling. One of the simplest SIR models for the virus spread in Northern Italy was introduced in [4] . Another research group used the logistic equation to analyze empirical data on the epidemic in different states [11] .",

Then, we apply A = 0.333 for the first period, A = 0.2 during the second period and we need A = 0.151 to eliminate the epidemic. Due to the quarantine, we reduced 40% of contacts, we now needs in reducing of 25% of existing contacts. Holding current values of contacts, we need rising the value of g from 0.05 to 0.09.",

We constructed the simplest version of population dynamics of age-structured population. Close work has been done in [13] , which is related to SIR model. In [13] , a temporal kernel F (t) has been introduced that modulates the infectivity of each infected individual. Compared to such model, we introduced the distribution of infected population at given moment of time via an age of infection, instead of looking just long history of focus populations. In other works related to the population dynamics of age-structured population, the differential equations with time delay usually have been considered. Instead, we use integro-differential system of equations, which seems to be an adequate approach to the current situation with COVID-19 epidemic.",

Next, we introduced two functions: f (x), which describes the distribution of infectivity by age, and g(x), which describes the content measures. In the normal SIR model, we have two parameters for the rate of infection and the removal of infections. In our integrodifferential model, mapping to elementary processes is straightforward: we just need the velocity parameter a and two periods: the incubation period L and recovery period T with symptoms after the carrier is separated from society. We derive an analytical result for exponential growth in the early stages of epidemics, as well as for the epidemic threshold. It will be very interesting to investigate the transitional situation near the threshold. We suggest simply making numbers and choosing a parameter value to match the correct exponential growth. We applied our model to understand the situation with epidemics in Armenia. What is advantageous in our model, that we can clearly separate two aspects of the epidemic: contact strength (through coefficient A) and deterrence measures through parameter g. We check that in fact we need to make minimal efforts to stop the epidemics, and testing is much cheaper during quarantine. Currently, if we detect only 3.5% of the infected population per day, strictly monitoring the symptoms, we can stop the epidemic. This is much more complicated without quarantine.",
