Elliotson was a member of the Royal College of Physicians, a friend of Charles Dickens, and a strong advocate of mesmerism [8]. Is borrowing a title of a book published a half century before a breech of ethics? The US copyright laws think not, unless there is \u201ca significant amount of original expression,\u201d a phrase which, like \u201cfair use\u201d (of borrowed material), is not clearly defined. Today, if I wanted to title my next book using the same words as Elliotson and Osler, I could do so with reasonable confidence, but not if my next book were titled, for instance, The Lord of the Rings or The Da Vinci Code, both of which seem to have a good deal of \u201coriginal expression\u201d [9].\n",

Among them are the words ambidextrous, ascetic, locomotion, prostate, and suicide [15, 16].\nVaccinate: In 1796 Edward Jenner was the first to use the word \u201cvaccinate,\u201d a very reasonable term considering that the material he used to protect humans from smallpox came from a cow (vacca in Latin).\nStreptococcus\nand\nStaphylococcus: In the mid-nineteenth century, the word \u201cStreptococcus\u201d was coined by Viennese physician Albert Theodor Billroth, based on Latin and Greek roots and describing bacteria seen in \u201cchains.\u201d Billroth\u2019s name is part of the today\u2019s surgical lexicon, used to describe a gastric reconstruction procedure (see Fig. 10.3). About this same time, Scottish surgeon and scientist Alexander Ogston gave us a new word, \u201cStaphylococcus,\u201d coming from similar roots, and identifying bacteria seen occurring in clusters under the microscope [16].\n\nPhantom limb: The phenomenon of perceiving sensation, sometimes including pain, following amputation of a limb had been known as early as the time of Ambroise Par\u00e9 in the sixteenth century, but it was not until 1871 that American physician and writer Silas Weir Mitchell created the authorism \u201cphantom limb\u201d [18].\nAnesthesia: William T.G. Morton introduced us to ether insensitivity to pain, but Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. gave us the word \u201canesthesia\u201d [19].\nMicroalbuminuria: In 1964, Harry Keen, Professor of Metabolism at Saint Guy\u2019s Medical School in London, introduced the word \u201cmicroalbuminuria,\u201d describing small amounts of albumin in the urine [20].\nGomer: In his satirical description of hospital life, The House of God, published in 1978, psychiatrist Steven Bergman, pseudonymously writing as Samuel Shem, MD, gave us the medical slang word gomer, to describe a patient who \u201chas lost\u2014often through age\u2014what goes into being a human being.\u201d Gomer is, in fact, an acronym for \u201cGet outta my emergency room,\u201d and thus probably should be in all capitals\u2014i.e., GOMER\u2014just like SCUBA and AIDS. Two of the Laws of The House of God are [21]:\nGomers don\u2019t die; andGomers go to ground.\n\nDiabesity: \u201cDiabesity,\u201d the combination of diabetes and obesity, entered our vocabulary with the publication of the book by Dr. Francine Kaufman titled Diabesity: The Obesity-Diabetes Epidemic That Threatens America\u2014And What We Must Do to Stop It [22]. A current Google search of the word \u201cdiabesity\u201d yielded several dozen sites; Kaufman\u2019s neologism seems to have \u201cstuck.\u201d\nSingularity: Also in 2005, futurist author Ray Kurzweil coined the term \u201csingularity\u201d to describe the time when humans and computers will merge as one through the addition of technological advances, such as tiny nanobots, to our brain function [23].\niPatient: In 2008, American physician Abraham Verghese gave us the freshly minted word \u201ciPatient,\u201d to describe the virtual patient discussed by students and residents while viewing online laboratory reports \u201cin the bunker while the real patients keep the beds warm and ensure that the folders bearing their names stay alive on the computer\u201d [24].\n",

It is used in genetics to mean \u201chaving only one alternative form, or one allele, of a gene or genes\u201d [25].\nJournalology: The term \u201cjournalology\u201d is the brainchild of former British Medical Journal editor Stephen Lock [26]. The word describes the use of biometrics to evaluate journals, and has to do with the impact factor, described in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-20264-8_3. The word \u201cjournalology\u201d, however, has no entry in Dictionary.com, and I can\u2019t say I have ever heard it used in conversation.\nNeosyndrome: Just below, I use this term.

            "text": "This, the word \u201cneosyndrome,\u201d is a neologism, an authorism I created just for fun. I could not find it in any dictionary, my MS Word Spellchecker rejects it, and a Google search comes up empty. It designates a newly described syndrome, which may be a recently recognized constellation of symptoms and signs, or perhaps a descriptive title for a behavioral or physical manifestation we all know. Some neosyndrome names involve place names, or activities, or even the names of patients. Some involve irony and wicked wit.\nLittle League pitcher\u2019s elbow and more: Among the diseases named for activities are \u201clittle pitcher\u2019s elbow,\u201d \u201csilo-filler disease,\u201d \u201cgamekeeper thumb,\u201d \u201ctennis elbow,\u201d and \u201cwelder\u2019s conjunctivitis.\u201d \u201cSaturday night paralysis\u201d occurs when an alcohol sedated individual sleeps with an arm over the armrest of a chair or the back of a park bench, sustaining a radial nerve palsy. When garment workers return after a weekend to a factory with the air laden with cotton dust, they may suffer \u201cMonday morning asthma.\u201d Then there is the \u201cSleeping Beauty syndrome\u201d (a pathologic sleep disturbance). Sometime, somewhere, someone thought up all these descriptors. All were once freshly described neosyndromes.\nChristmas disease: In 1952, Biggs et al. told of a new type of bleeding disorder\u2014Christmas disease\u2014named for the first patient described with the hematologic abnormality, Stephen Christmas [27]. Were editors indulging their sense of humor when the article appeared in the British Medical Journal Christmas issue? The eponymous title of the disease has endured. But would it have been so if the index case had been John Jones or Mary Smith?\nAlice in Wonderland syndrome: The term \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d syndrome describes perceived alterations in body image sometimes seen with migraine or epilepsy; it was first used medically in 1955 by British psychiatrist John Todd, alluding to the well-known Lewis Carroll book Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland [28] (see Fig. 10.4).\n\nThe Ulysses syndrome: We have an entire universe of iatrogenic syndromes caused by therapeutic misadventures. The Ulysses syndrome, first described by Rang in 1972, is different. It is a side effect of investigation, and also might be identified as the \u201claboratory error syndrome\u201d or the \u201ctop/bottom of the bell curve syndrome.\u201d The non-disease begins with the discovery of an unanticipated abnormality on a laboratory panel or roentgenogram. This prompts a return visit to the doctor, who dispatches the healthy patient on an odyssey of unnecessary testing, imaging, and perhaps scoping. The most serious risk of being the victim of the Ulysses syndrome is not the wasted time and money, but the very real possibility that the investigation might culminate in needless therapy or even invasive surgery [30].\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease: Legionnaires\u2019 disease was so named because the index cases were American Legion members all staying in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia in July 1976. The disease, of course, has no other connection with this respected veteran\u2019s organization, and I suspect its members wish the new disease had been named something else, perhaps the Bellevue-Stratford disease. But it may be too late to call it Philadelphia disease.\nKabuki syndrome: \u201cKabuki syndrome,\u201d described by Kuroki in 1981, takes its name from the facial similarity of patients to the makeup of actors in traditional Japanese Kabuki Theater. Those afflicted have large ears, elongated palpebral fissures, a depressed tip of the nose, skeletal abnormalities, and mental retardation [31].\nSARS: In 2003, we witnessed the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which began in China, and, thanks to the miracle of modern air travel, eventually killed 775 persons in 37 countries. The name given hastily to the manifestations\u2014severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014was not especially inventive, or even descriptive of the geographic or other locus of origin.In April 2014 the USA recognized its first case of another acute pulmonary disease, named the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) [32]. The infected individual had recently returned home to Munster, Indiana, from Saudi Arabia. Both SARS and MERS are neosyndromes, as was the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s.\nBorrelia miyamotoi\ndisease: Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is named for Lyme, Connecticut, where a cluster of cases occurred in 1975. Now we have a new disease, caused by a cousin of B. burgdorferi named B. miyamotoi, detected first in Connecticut and subsequently found to be spread by all the same tick species that are the vectors for Lyme disease [33]. \u201cBorrelia miyamotoi disease\u201d is much too cumbersome a title for continued use, and so this new disease is a naming opportunity for someone.\nPhiladelphia syndrome: In searching for neosyndromes, I came to the 2013 description of a mystery ailment affecting chiefly young women in the Philadelphia area, characterized by sudden personality changes, uncontrolled movements, and seizures. Physicians report, \u201cIt is like your brain is on fire\u201d [34]. Will this entity, in time, come to be known as \u201cPhiladelphia syndrome?\u201d\nPCHD: In the wicked wit category is \u201cpolitical correctness hyperactivity disorder (PCHD),\u201d a neosyndrome concept promulgated by Martin in a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal describing America\u2019s current state of political affairs [35]. The author writes, \u201cWhat we have before us is a postmodern magisterium of secular doctrine, affected with political correctness hyperactivity disorder (PCHD) and fueled by a utopian ambition that see no limits to its quest for power in the guise of public service.\u201d\n",

            "text": "If you decide to become a volume editor of a reference work, here are Dr. Taylor\u2019s ten rules to guide you to a timely, rewarding conclusion [38]:\nPersonal planning: Organize your personal schedule as you plan the project. An edited book in not a steady effort. There are three very time-intensive phases; in between there are quiet times. The busy stages are (1) author recruitment, (2) manuscript editing, and (3) proofreading of book pages. These will not be good times to book a month-long ocean cruise.\nAuthor selection: Choose the author for each chapter with care. Match each author with a topic that he or she wants to \u201cclaim\u201d in the literature. Even if you, the editor, are not well known, the prospective author will often agree to write the chapter, because that person knows that a refusal means you will offer the topic to someone else.\nRecruiting authors: Be firm in recruiting only authors committed to the project. An eager assistant professor may, in the end, be a better choice than the already over-committed senior faculty member. In the end, a late contributor responsible for a \u201cmust-have\u201d chapter can delay the entire project. Early warning signs of potential tardiness in manuscript delivery are initial hesitation about the project, a long discussion about the many projects your possible author already has committed to do, and early attempts to negotiate a later deadline for manuscript submission. If you sense any of these \u201cred flags,\u201d it might be best to go on to someone else.\nInstructions to authors: Provide crystal-clear instructions. Often the publisher has generic Instructions to Authors. You should consider creating your own supplementary instructions. For example: Do you want each chapter to begin with a quotation from Shakespeare or Osler? How many illustrations\u2014if any\u2014do you want in the chapter? How many reference citations are desired?\nPage allocations: Be very specific in your page allocations. If you tell the author you want, for example, a chapter of 20 manuscript pages, do you mean single-spaced or double-spaced pages? And does your page allocation include the Reference list at the end of the chapter, which can run to several manuscript pages?\nOverwriting: Beware of authors\u2019 tendency to write too many pages, even in spite of instructions any high school student could understand. It is hard to believe, but most authors tend to overwrite. Adding a few pages to the desired chapter length might not seem to be important, that is, until 50 or 80 or 100 authors all exceed page allocations, and the final book becomes a heavy tome. This has happened to me, as I described in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-20264-8_7.\nWhat you do and don\u2019t want in the manuscripts: Tell your authors your wishes about other things that may find their way into manuscripts: Do you want footnotes, or should all material be presented in the text? Would an Appendix to the chapter be acceptable? Will it be okay if authors thank their administrative assistants, spouses, or mentors?\nReminders: Remind all authors monthly of the project. A real danger is that contributors forget about their chapters. After all, you gave the author a 6-month deadline, and so a natural tendency is to delay writing, focusing on more urgent issues such as teaching or seeing patients. Then, in a few months, the chapter you are counting on has become hazy in the author\u2019s memory. The way to avoid this is to send monthly reminders to all contributors. I tend to vary these: e-mails 1 month, postcards the next, letters the next, and so forth.\nFollowing through: After the edited work is published, be sure to thank your authors and confirm that each has received the promised copy of the book. If you promised authors a small fraction of the book\u2019s royalties (a practice which I do not advise), be sure this pittance is received. Fractional royalties due contributors represent tiny payments; but there will be many of them, and the publisher\u2019s accounting department hates this practice. Nevertheless, if you made such a promise, be sure the publisher follows through.\nLooking to the future: Following publication, keep in touch with those who wrote for you, perhaps sending them copies of the book\u2019s glowing reviews. After all, you may want these authors to update their chapters in a few years or contribute to your next edited book.\n",
