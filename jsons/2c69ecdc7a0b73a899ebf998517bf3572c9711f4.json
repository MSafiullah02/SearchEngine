            "text": "Many neurological diseases may cause acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to involvement of bulbar respiratory center, spinal cord, motoneurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or skeletal muscles. In this context, respiratory emergencies are often a challenge at home, in a neurology ward, or even in an intensive care unit, influencing morbidity and mortality. More commonly, patients develop primarily ventilatory impairment causing hypercapnia. Moreover, inadequate bulbar and expiratory muscle function may cause retained secretions, frequently complicated by pneumonia, atelectasis, and, ultimately, hypoxemic ARF. On the basis of the clinical onset, two main categories of ARF can be identified: (i) acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, which is common in slowly progressive neurological diseases, such as movement disorders and most neuromuscular diseases, and (ii) sudden-onset respiratory failure which may develop in rapidly progressive neurological disorders including stroke, convulsive status epilepticus, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, phrenic neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. A tailored assistance may include manual and mechanical cough assistance, noninvasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or tracheotomy. This review provides practical recommendations for prevention, recognition, management, and treatment of respiratory emergencies in neurological diseases, mostly in teenagers and adults, according to type and severity of baseline disease.",

Acute respiratory failure (ARF) may often occur in patients with acute or chronic neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis (MG), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), polymyositis (PM), or dermatomyositis (DM). In these patients, weakness of diaphragm, intercostal and expiratory muscles, or concomitant pulmonary complications due to oropharyngeal dysfunction causing aspiration of secretions/food/drink or inefficient cough may lead to respiratory emergencies [2] . In all these neurological disorders, respiratory involvement may increase the burden of the existing disease and mortality.",

Emergency room (ER) physicians and consultant neurologists must be aware of the respiratory risks of such patients, be able to recognize early signs, and take action to treat RF adequately. In this context, a competent multidisciplinary team is fundamental including pneumologist, anesthetist, nurse, physical therapist, and speech therapist. Indeed, these cases not infrequently represent a diagnostic challenge in the acute care settings, especially in a busy ER, because of patients' poor ability to communicate and scanty experience of health professionals in caring for patients with neurological diseases [3, 4] . Furthermore, increase in survival of patients with SMA and DMD has emphasized the need for a smooth and successful transition from pediatric to adult healthcare [5, 6] . Unfortunately, many healthcare services are not equipped to provide modified age-appropriate assistance and expertise. This is particularly true at ER, leading to an inadequate medical approach and patients' and caregivers' apprehensiveness with loss of the sense of health protection [7, 8] .",

Indeed, in patients with neurological disorders, inadequate bulbar and expiratory muscle function may cause retained secretions, frequently complicated by pneumonia, atelectasis, and, ultimately, hypoxemic ARF. These conditions can result in hospitalizations, endotracheal intubations, tracheostomy, and death [13] . In rapidly progressing NMDs, ARF due to accumulation of lung secretions (\"lung failure\") can be the earliest symptom [14] . Cough peak expiratory flow (CPEF) is a measure of the maximum airflow generated during cough and is normally 360 to 1200 L / min; of interest, CPEF may provide valuable information on the ability to clear airway secretions, with values below 160 L/ min usually indicating the need for tracheal suctioning and an increased risk of mucous encumbrance at the onset of respiratory infections, contributing to the development of atelectasis and acute hypoxemia [15] .",

Weakness after stroke also affects muscles of the respiratory system, and patients typically have altered breathing control, reduced maximal voluntary strength, and decreased endurance of inspiratory and expiratory muscles, as well as altered chest wall kinematics [17, 18] . Associated factors may be impaired vigilance, inefficient cough, aspiration, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolus, and pulmonary edema (neurogenic or cardiogenic) [19] . The risk of respiratory impairment associated to large hemispheric stroke increases after a few days' delay, as cerebral edema intensifies. Sustained hyperventilation in a patient with mass effect can be a manifestation of diencephalic herniation. Ataxic or cluster breathing patterns can be part of brainstem syndromes, and recurrent apnea is a warning sign in patients with basilar artery occlusion. Cheyne-Stokes breathing, characterized by oscillating cycles of hyperpnea alternating with periods of apnea, is a frequent finding after massive hemispheric stroke [20] . Chest infections, such as pneumonia, are the most frequent complications of stroke and occur in up to one-third of patients, resulting in up to a threefold increased risk of death in the first 30 days, longer hospital stay, and poorer postdischarge outcomes [21] .",

Other myopathies at risk are some limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (especially sarcoglycanopathies) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The latter is a complex multi-systemic disease, in which cardiomyopathy and disturbances of central breathing regulation coexist, which make ventilatory management difficult [51] . The autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), related to the 4q region, may develop ARDS generally in early-onset cases [52] . Among metabolic myopathies, Pompe disease caused by mutations of the acid alpha glucosidase enzyme gene is still at risk of RF, despite the availability of enzyme replacement therapy for over 10 years. About a third of cases with infantileonset (IOPD) in the first year of life require ventilatory support, as well as a minority of cases with adult form [53] . Some adults start with dyspnea and hypercapnic RF and can be diagnosed after acute ventilatory failure. However, all patients should be carefully monitored for respiratory function. Acute or subacute inflammatory myopathies, especially the autoimmune necrotizing myopathies with positive anti-SRP antibodies, can rapidly evolve into respiratory emergencies.",

Due to the risk of rapid variation of the patient's clinical status, continuous monitoring of systemic oxygenation through pulse oximetry is essential. Mechanically ventilated patients should undergo regular arterial blood gas monitoring.

Predictors of death include low GCS at intubation and absent pupillary light reflexes. 15-35 % of stroke patients admitted at the ICU require tracheostomy for difficult weaning.
