It has been eradicated from many regions of the world where re-introduction has devastating economic, social and environmental effects (Woolhouse et al., 2001). The causative virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), causes vesicles on the foot, mouth, tongue, and teats of cloven-hooved animals and is one of the most contagious disease agents known. FMD is classified as a reportable disease by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE).",

For example, the reappearance of FMD in the United Kingdom in 2001 resulted in multi-billion dollar losses associated not only with agriculture, but a wide range of activities including the pharmaceutical and tourist industries (Thompson et al., 2002). In order to re-gain FMD-free status, countries like the UK must demonstrate freedom not only of the disease but also of the virus in their animal population. Therefore, control measures include mass slaughter of animals in premises reporting disease as well as neighboring premises. In 2001, this approach resulted in the slaughter of millions of animals, most of which were not infected, to quickly achieve eradication (Davies, 2002).",

These differences motivated further evaluation of IRT as a screening test for FMDV-infected cattle. To identify the best site for FMD screening, maximum foot temperatures, maximum face temperatures, and rectal temperatures were plotted with clinical scores. Foot temperatures paralleled clinical scores better than face and rectal temperatures in 14/17 (82.4%) vaccinated-unprotected cattle (see example in Fig. 2\nA). In contrast, the foot temperatures of vaccinated-protected animals remained low, reflecting their protective immune status (see example in Fig. 2B). Further confirmation of the foot as an ideal site to screen for FMDV-infected cattle came from correlation analysis of contact (n\n = 6) and directly (n\n = 12) inoculated animals with maximum foot, eye, and floor temperatures and rectal temperatures. Moderate positive correlations between maximum foot temperatures and rectal and eye temperatures were identified (r\n \n=\n 0.53 and r\n \n=\n 0.60, respectively) as well as between the rectal and eye temperatures (r\n \n=\n 0.50). Conversely, a small positive correlation was demonstrated between the floor temperature and foot temperatures (r\n \n=\n 0.18) indicating that foot temperatures detected by IRT were not affected by floor temperature under the experimental conditions of this study (Fig. 3\n). Based on this evidence, all further analyses were focused on maximum foot temperature as determined by IRT.",

In this study, 3/6 (50.0%) CT animals were positive by IRT 1 day prior to having detectable viremia and 2 days prior to the development of foot lesions (Fig. 6\nA). At 1 day post-challenge (DPC), of the ten DI animals assessed for viremia, 100% were viremic and 7/12 (58.3%) were detected by IRT (Fig. 6A).

Eight of 21 (38.1%) VT animals developed viremia and foot lesions by 2 DPC. One animal was detected by IRT at 1 DPC and five were detected the next day (data not shown).

Veterinary studies have also been varied. Schaefer et al. identified IRT as a method for early detection of animals infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (Schaefer et al., 2004) or with bovine respiratory disease using facial scans (Schaefer et al., 2007). Infrared has been identified as a possible detection method for laminitis in lactating dairy cattle (Nikkhah et al., 2005) and chronic pain following tail docking (Eicher et al., 2006). Measurements from IRT have also been used to recognize orthopedic injuries in dogs and horses (Eddy et al., 2001), rabies virus in raccoons (Dunbar and MacCarthy, 2006), and mange in the Spanish ibex (Arenas et al., 2002). These studies have concluded that while IRT provides an additional perspective on disease and injury, it should complement traditional diagnostics methods. Similarly, the present study assessed the application of IRT as a screening method for identifying potential FMDV-infected cattle for further sampling and laboratory confirmation of infection. This is the first report of IRT as a screening method for FMD in cattle.",

The highest face temperature is often identified in the eye, which is believed to reflect internal body temperature (Kastberger and Stachl, 2003). Interestingly, we did not see a strong positive correlation between face and rectal temperatures. While we were able to identify a positive correlation between foot temperatures and rectal temperatures, increases in foot temperatures consistently occurred prior to the development of fever. Furthermore, the presentation of fever occurs in a wide variety of illnesses in cattle but increased foot temperatures have fewer etiologies. We were unable to identify a large correlation between foot and floor temperatures, strongly suggesting that under the conditions of this study floor temperature did not influence the temperature of the foot.",

In contrast, IRT identified increased foot temperatures prior to the detection of viremia and foot lesions in CT animals. The ability of IRT to detect animals infected with FMDV by contact (presumably the mechanism of infection during natural transmission) not only in the pre-clinical but even during the pre-viremic phase provides strong evidence that this technology can be very useful in detecting FMDV-infected animals prior to other evidence of infection. This early detection capability can become critical during an FMD outbreak, particularly when suspect animals need to be identified for diagnostic sample collection. Since two-thirds of pre-clinical and 100% of clinical CT animals in this study had a maximum foot temperature above the cut-off of 34.4 \u00b0C, it is likely that at least one animal in an infected herd would be detected by IRT during an FMD outbreak.",

The fact that only 8/21 (38.1%) VT animals developed viremia supports the hypothesis that the VT animals developed partial protection to FMDV after vaccination. This partial protection might or might not interfere with the inflammatory process, and may make IRT pre-clinical detection of VT animals more difficult. Infected animals without clinical signs might or might not be detectable through inflammatory responses in the coronary band and resultant rise in temperature. This may or may not limit the usefulness of this test in screening for FMD in countries that use FMDV vaccines and where partially protected animals would be common. Another potential limitation of this technology is the cost of the infrared cameras used in this study.

This limitation could be avoided by having veterinary assistants trained in IRT scan the herds with an IRT camera before veterinarians enter the premises. Furthermore, with existing wireless technology, IR images could be transmitted remotely to incident command centers where veterinarians could pre-select animals for further clinical examination and sampling. Other potential uses of IRT technology could be in combination with rapid pen-side diagnostic tests such as real-time RT-PCR or antigen detection methods.
