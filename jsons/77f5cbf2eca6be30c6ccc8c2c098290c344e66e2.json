For example, the median age below 20, [5] and the low rates of urbanization, could potentially lead to a lower death toll of the epidemic in African countries than elsewhere. However, having a young population implies that many infected individuals may not display symptoms and will risk infecting more people than would symptomatic individuals. [6] Additionally, the large number of informal settlements could accentuate this phenomenon. It is therefore urgent to develop a framework that could accurately predict the spread of the virus, accounting for the idiosyncrasies of the African context. A country-specific model will provide policy makers with a wide range of prediction scenarios, based on different actions they can take to address the pandemic. With the scarce resources at their disposal, [7, 8] models like these will help target prevention strategies to individuals with co-morbidities who might suffer the most from the epidemic. Moreover, with containment policies that can grind economies to a halt, [9] understanding the trade-off between rural and urban spreads could lead to better informed decisions between the short term impacts of the epidemic, and the long-term looming shortage in the food-supply that could stem enforcing strict social distancing measures in rural areas.",

[29] In Asia and Europe, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases have been drivers of adverse health outcomes. [29, 30] Because the combined prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and obesity are not higher in Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal than they are in regions we use to derive the recovery rates, the baseline simulations already account for them. However, Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal have a persistent and high rates of anemia and tuberculosis [3] (see table 6 ). To our knowledge, there is no study on the magnitude of the impacts of anemia, tuberculosis, or HIV on the recovery of patients who have contracted the virus. We simulate two scenarios, with 25% and 75% of the recovery rate of otherwise healthy individuals for individuals with one of these underlying conditions1 (see table 5 ). In comparison, Zhou et al. [29] find that in Wuhan, China, patients with comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, carcinoma, chronic kidney diseases and others) have a recovery rate equal to 73.2% of their otherwise healthy counterparts. Though uncertain for HIV, anemia and TB, the impact of these underlying conditions on the recovery of individuals will likely lie between these two bounds. This translates into adjusting for individuals with TB, HIV, and anemia. Comorbidities have age-specific incidence rates; anemia affects women of child bearing age primarily, while HIV affects young adults at higher rates. The prevalence of HIV, TB and anemia are extracted from the open database Global Burden Disease. [31] We account for these age-based differences to compute the recovery rate of the population accounting for comorbidities:",

The policies could have had impacts similar to the ones in South Korea. We present results of simulations mirroring the for South Korea. Specifically, we decrease for each country three weeks after the last recorded policy to 0.88, and then again at 6 weeks to 0.3. We find that the peak is much lower, with a number of active severe infections at the peak between 166 and 214 individuals for Ghana, 208 and 286 individuals for Kenya, and 140 and 189 individuals for Senegal; with the two bounds being a for recovery rates of respectively 75% and 25% of the recovery rate otherwise healthy patients.

We find that the relatively young population may limit the severity of the epidemic, by lowering the number of infections that lead to severe symptoms. We also find that sparsely populated areas may limit the spread of the epidemic. Rural areas effectively may lead to staggered peaks; this has important implications for policy makers who may be faced with two waves, and so may need to adapt their responses to adaptively deploy personnel on their territory as these peaks occur. High rates of comorbidities however may lead to more individuals developing severe symptoms relative to a scenario with no comorbidities. We find that at the peak Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal are predicted to have respectively between 0.78 and 1.03%, 0.89 and 1.22%, and finally, 0.60 and .84% active clinical severe cases of COVID-19 with a peak of total infections predicted to occur between June 2 and June 17 (Ghana), July 22 and August 29 (Kenya), and May 28 and June 15 (Senegal) respectively against a July timeline for our baseline specification.

[10] account for age-based population mixing and assume that asymptomatic individuals are as infectious as symptomatic individuals to predict that by the end of the year, 46.1 million (i.e. 89% of the public) of infections will have occurred. This prediction is comparable with the baseline results of our study in the absence of further containment policies.

This study is a first attempt at accounting for rural densities and co-morbidity, and it suggests that rural areas will slow down the spread of the epidemic, and that relatively young population will keep the number of severe cases low compared to the nearly 3.5% hospitalization rate in Europe and central Asia. [42] Our findings also show how sensitive these results are to different assumptions on the effectiveness of policies, assumptions on co-morbidities and differential effective rates of reproduction in rural and urban areas.",
