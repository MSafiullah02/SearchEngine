Many scientific articles (peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed) have been published regarding epidemiology 1 , pathogenesis 2 , complications 3 and treatment. 4 The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to implement unparalleled measures to curb the rapid spread of the disease including strict lockdown, banning of all organised and social gatherings (including sports events) and restricting non-essential travel, with a significant effect on the sports industry and athletes. In South Africa, level 5 lockdown measures were enforced from 26 March to 30 April (5 weeks). Only essential services, travel and shopping were allowed and exercise outside individual property boundaries was not allowed, 5 likely having a psychological impact on all, including athletes. 6 Our current understanding of these lockdown measures on training, nutrition and mental health of athletes are limited.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures significantly impacted elite and semi-elite athletes in South Africa. One of our key findings is that despite high levels of uncertainty regarding RTS guidelines, most athletes are continuing to train daily. Two out of three athletes trained alone with only a minority of athletes using digital guidance by a professional. There are certain risks to unsupervised training, 12 including an inadvertent lapse into poor technique and posture, which may predispose athletes to injuries. 13 Solo training and a lack of sport-specific training may also be challenging for athletes who participate in team and very technical (e.g. pole vault) sports. More than half of the athletes were training at a moderate exercise intensity for 30-60min per day, at a lower training load than normal. Moderate training loads allow for recovery and this is important during the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid blunting of the immune system. [15] [16] [17] Even though the additional recovery time came at an opportune time (e.g. Olympics was 4 months away), deconditioning is bound to occur, posing challenges in reconditioning and safe RTS. 12 The majority of athletes engaged in own bodyweight strength training, cardio workouts, and functional sport-specific training, resembling appropriate active rest phase modalities. 18 Only a small number of athletes included proprioception in their programs. Good proprioception plays an important role in accurate movement patterns and can prevent injuries and recurrence of injuries. 19 Such exercises are easy to do indoors and even in confined spaces, and should be recommended. Athletes had considerable access to equipment, including sports specific equipment, treadmills, steppers, free weights, swimming pools and stationary bikes, confinement not only affect the physiological status of athletes, [23] [24] but the inability to compete may also influence athlete mental health. 25 We found that one in two athletes was depressed, with energy loss and lack of motivation to train. Females are more affected in all these spheres, with potentially profound adverse effects on their mental health. [26] [27] A recent consensus document on athlete mental health stressed the importance of mental wellbeing for optimal performance. 25 Access to psychological support to maintain their mental health during and after lockdown is paramount. A significant proportion of athletes reported a change in sleep routine, even though still restful. Nevertheless, almost half of the respondents reported feeling chronically fatigued. Quality and quantity of sleep have a significant impact on injury incidence and recovery post-exercise. 28 Sleep allows for the immune system to regenerate and recuperate. 29 The athletes also correctly recognised the most significant symptoms of COVID-19 as communicated by the World Health Organisation 10 , NICD 11 and National Department of Health 36 , being shortness of breath, fever, dry cough and a sore throat. Almost all athletes knew how to proceed if they suspected having contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Three out of four athletes know they should either contact their doctors, or the NICD toll-free number for guidance. These findings underline the vital role and efficacy of high quality messaging in traditional and social media in a pandemic.",

Continuous athlete education to promote required behaviours, preparing the environment and health screening to evaluate COVID-19 status prior to RTS is needed. 38 Physiological readiness to RTS should include re-evaluating weight, blood pressure, liver function, glucose, glycated haemoglobin and lipid profiles. 39 Then a stepwise and sport-specific return to training, synchronised with the expected gradual lifting of restrictions of movement and social distancing is advised. 38 High load, training load fluctuations that negatively impact acute:chronic load ratios are known injury risk factors. [13] [14] Accelerated RTS after the lockdown of NFL athletes in 2011, subsequently lead to high injury rates. 12 Ongoing monitoring of training loads, injury and illness upon RTS and addressing any deficits regarding the level of conditioning, strength, proprioception, neuromuscular activation and sport-specific conditioning following this period of lockdown, is recommended. [40] [41] [42] Further, nutrition, sleep, mental and general health issues related to restriction of movement should be addressed [40] [41] [42] and supported through the RTS process. 43 It is also important to control the possible spreading of the virus during RTS, as well as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 23 managing the progress of the pandemic by early detection and management of new cases in the sports community to mitigate a second wave. 23, 38 The majority of our study participants were males, with the sex distribution of our participants being representative of the current South African athlete population. 44 Convenience sampling was used and team sports were overrepresented, thus the findings may not be generalisable to individual sports. We did not require athletes to report pre-lockdown sleep patterns, mental status or supplement use thus findings cannot be comparable to pre-lockdown habits. We did not specifically differentiate between guided or unguided training programs, even though there was an option to indicate guidance by professionals.",

Few partook in alcohol-related activities during this period. The detrimental effects of sedentary behaviour on both physical and mental health is beyond dispute.[21][22] Realistic changes to decrease sedentary behaviour during the lockdown needs to be advocated by health care professionals.

Impaired nutrition may result in a myriad of issues upon RTS including deteriorated performance, lifestyle-related concerns and affecting weight category sport.30 Athletes are generally believed to consume substantial amounts of supplements, 31 but a large percentage of athletes in our study did not consume supplements. Only one in three athletes used a combination of vitamin C, multivitamins, zinc, vitamin B, protein and other unclassifiable supplements. During the COVID-19 pandemic some authors have advised taking supplements including vitamin C, zinc and vitamin D for immune enhancement.4,20 Most athletes can train outside without breaking regulations, exposing them to natural light to allow vitamin D synthesis.32 Given the significant inadequacies in nutrition during the lockdown, it seems appropriate to implement nutritional guidance by a sports nutritionist, both during the lockdown and afterward.The majority of athletes had access to healthcare professionals, mostly through telehealth. With the implementation of the lockdown and dangers of COVID-19, the Health Professionals Council of South Africa relaxed its regulations on the use of telehealth, making it more accessible.33 Only one in four had access to a sports physician, perhaps due to financial or traveling constraints. The athletes accessed traditional and social media to gain knowledge on COVID-19 demostrating the ability of these platforms to reach wide audience to deliver key public health messages. It appears that doctors or other evidence-based platforms were poorly utilised for this purpose possibly because healthcare professionals did not reach out to the athlete population. Nevertheless, athletes had good knowledge about COVID-19 preventative measures and presenting symptoms. They identified handwashing with soap and water or the use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers as a priority in reducing their risk of contracting the virus. Applying respiratory hygiene was rated high while only one in two athletes recognised social distancing of >2 meters as important. Even though athletes were aware of how to mitigate the risk, they lacked awareness of the priorities of risk modification.10 The timing of the survey may have contributed to athletes favouring the use of surgical and FFP1/FFP2/N95 masks (which should be reserved for healthcare professionals), instead of a cloth mask.Cloth masks have shown some potential to reduce the risk of viral transmission.34 This information was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 22 shared by the government shortly before the start of the survey, which may have biased the responses.35",
