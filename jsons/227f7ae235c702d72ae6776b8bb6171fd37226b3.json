It illustrated clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of 149 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wenzhou. It showed most patients presented with a mild infection and some patients even presented with a normal chest finding despite testing positive for COVID-19. 1 However, the cases in Wuhan were more severe compared to Wenzhou. Fatalities associated with COVID-19 were of great public health concern. Most of all, the relationship between possible risk factors during the early period and outcome in critical cases with COVID-19 are not fully interpreted.",

The other two independent high-risk factors, increased blood urine nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase were related to renal failure, heart failure or multi organ failure (MOF) which may lead to fatality of COVID-19. It was reported that cardiovascular complications were common in patients with SARS. 4 Recent study demonstrated ACE-2 receptor of SARS-CoV was highly expressed in renal tubules. 5 The kidney injury may be caused by coronavirus which entering kidney cells through an ACE2-dependent pathway. 6 Moreover, MOF is regarded as a predictive factor related to most end stage of diseases.",

To use the nomogram, locate the first variable. Draw a line straight upwards to the Points axis to determine the number of points received for the variable. Repeat this process for the other three variables and sum up the points achieved for each variable. Sum of these numbers is located on the Total Points axis, and a line is drawn downwards to the survival axes to determine the likelihood of 14-, 21-,35-day survival. Calculation of survival can be automated through computerized programming. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.025 0163-4453/\u00a9 2020 The British Infection Association.
