Extrapolating our age-specific rates to the population of seniors in the United States who were not in nursing homes, as reported in 2000 census data [16] , we estimate a disease burden of 551,600 cases of CAP treated on an outpatient basis and 364,300 cases of CAP resulting in hospitalization, for a total of 915,900 cases of CAP. These rates also indicate that \u223c1 of every 20 persons aged \u044385 years will have a new episode of CAP each year.",

[1] in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored prospective study of radi-ographically confirmed hospitalization for CAP patients in 2 counties in Ohio in 1991. After adjusting for differences in the age distribution of persons aged \u044365 years in the 2 study populations, our age-adjusted hospitalization rate of 10.4 cases per 1000 person-years was nearly identical to the rate of 10.1 cases per 1000 person-years among community-dwelling seniors reported by Marston et al. [1] . The Ohio study did not, however, include an assessment of outpatient visits for CAP, which is particularly important, given the trend towards outpatient treatment that has occurred over the past 2 decades. We found that, even among persons aged \u044380 years, nearly one-half (49.3%) of CAP events were treated on an outpatient basis. Inclusion of outpatient episodes allows a more comprehensive estimate of the burden of disease and a more accurate assessment of risk factors for CAP. Persons with chronic conditions who develop CAP are more likely to be hospitalized for treatment than are persons without chronic conditions. This means that assessments restricted to hospitalizations for CAP will likely overestimate the association of those conditions with the risk of CAP.",

Neither of these studies assessed whether male sex was associated with pneumonia after adjusting for other risk factors, so it was not clear in these studies whether male sex was simply a marker for a higher prevalence of other risk factors. A population-based study involving 4175 elderly persons in Finland found that crude CAP rates did not differ between men and women and that male sex was not significantly associated with CAP after accounting for age and certain chronic medical conditions and risk factors, including asthma, receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, and heart disease [21] . Because our study population was much larger than that of the Finnish study, we have more power to detect an independent risk of CAP associated with male sex if such a risk truly exists. However, it is possible that the difference in risk we observed could be the result of confounding by factors unmeasured in our population.",

The 1999-2000 influenza season is recognized as having been more severe than the several preceding seasons [10] , and timing of the peak rate of CAP for the elderly GHC population in this study period closely matched the peak proportional pneumonia and influenza mortality rates in the United States, occurring in late December 1999 and early January 2000.
