            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCVs) are causative agents of respiratory illness in man. In healthy adults they are associated with common colds of mild to moderate severity, usually of 6-8 days duration. The typical symptoms are nasal catarrh and sore throat, although headache, fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms are occasionally reported. Epidemiological data indicate that worldwide HCVs account for 5-35% of all upper respiratory tract infections. HCV infection in children may also lead to lower respiratory illness, including bronchitis and pneumonia. [For a review of the biology and pathogenesis of HCVs see Hierholzer and Tannock, 1988.1 HCVs can be divided into two major antigenic groups represented by HCV229E and HCVOC43 [Macnaughton et al., 1981; Pedersen et al., 19781 . The HCV229E virion is comprised of a positive strand RNA genome, which if HCV is similar to other coronaviruses is about 30 kilobases (kb) in length; a lipid envelope; and three major proteins: the nucleocapsid protein, N (mol. wt. 50,000); the membrane glycoprotein, M (mol. wt. 21,000-25,000); and the spike glycoprotein, S (mol. wt. 186,000) [Kemp et al., 1984; Macnaughton and Madge, 1978; Schmidt and Kenny, 19821 . Viruses of the OC43 group have an additional surface glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase, HE (mol. wt. 65 x lo3) [Hogue and Brian, 19861 . The replication of HCV229E involves the synthesis of a 3' co-terminal set of six subgenomic RNAs [Weiss and Leibowitz, 19811 . It is assumed that these RNAs are synthesized in the cytoplasm of infected cells by a process of leader-primed discontinuous transcription, as has been described for the murine hepatitis virus, MHV [Baric et al., 1985; Shieh et al., 19871. Recently, the HCV229E genes encoding the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins have been cloned and sequenced and their order on the genome has been determined as 5' S-M-N 3' [Raabe and Siddell, 1989a; Raabe et al., 1990; Schreiber et al., 19891. Raabe et al. [1990] have proposed that the subgenomic RNAs 2, 6 , 7 function as the mRNAs for the S, M, and N proteins, respectively.",

However, this approach is time consuming and requires considerable expertise. Only HCV229E-like viruses can be directly isolated in cell culture and other HCVs have to be isolated in organ culture and, if possible, adapted to cell monolayers [see Hierholzer and Tannock, 19881. The second approach is serological. Almost all the standard tests, including serum neutralization, complement fixation, and haemagglutinin inhibition (for OC43-like virus) have been used, but they are relatively insensitive and are not widely applied. More recently, enzyme-linked immunoassays have been developed [Kraaijeveld et al., 1980; Macnaughton et al., 1981, 19821 and at the present time they provide the most reliable epidemiological information on HCV infections. The major drawback is that paired sera are required and due to the ubiquity of HCV, and the frequency of reinfection, the differences in antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera are rarely dramatic.",

The two major infection-specific polypeptides which can be identified have apparent molecular weights of 50,000 and 23,000, representing the N and M proteins, respectively [Schmidt and Kenny, 19821 . The in vitro translation of capped, synthetic RNA derived from pSM/ FGMl (lanes E and F) also results in a major product of 50,000 mol. wt. These data provide strong evidence for the identity of the pSM/F1 insert as a cDNA copy of the HCV229E mRNA7. However, it is also clear in Figure  3 that the translation of both natural and synthetic mRNAs results in a second major product of 44,000 mol. wt., the molecular weight of the N gene product predicted from the amino acid sequence alone. The relationship of the 44,000 and 50,000 mol. wt. species is not known a t the moment, but it seems likely that they represent related polypeptides, at least one of which has been post-translationally modified. It is striking that the in vitro translation of a non-capped, synthetic RNA derived from pSM/FGMl (lanes G and H) resulted in only the 50,000 mol. wt. product.

The viruses which were tested are listed in Table I , together with the titres of infectious virus in the material used to inoculate the nasal washings. As can be seen, the titres used greatly exceed those which would be expected in nasal washings from patients.

Also, it is known that a t least for one coronavirus, the murine hepatitis virus (MHV), recombination occurs in vivo and in vitro at relatively high frequencies [Makino et al., 1986a,b; Keck et al., 19881 .

            "text": "The final consideration is the application of nucleic acid hybridization as a routine procedure for the diagnosis of HCV229E infection. A major advantage of this approach is its speed. The test can be conducted within 24 hours and with the advent of antiviral chemotherapy a rapid diagnosis would be imperative prior to specific medication. A second advantage is that the approach is independent of whether or not virus is bound by antibody or drugs. This could be important, for example, when virus infection persists in the presence of antibody or in situations where virus infection has to be monitored following medication. At the present time, the major disadvantage of the method is the radioactive nature of the probe. However, a number of non-radioactive detection systems are currently being developed and this modification would make the hybridisation approach suitable for general diagnostic use. HCV229E N protein gene with the HCVOC43 N protein gene [Kamahora et al., 19891 is shown in Figure 7 . This comparison predicts that the potential for cross hybridization is very low. In a region corresponding to the nucleotides 229 to 315 (2293) and 364 to 450 (OC43) of the N gene, the nucleotide sequence similarity is significant, but even so would not lead to cross hybridization under the conditions used in our experiments. Secondly, the specificity can be determined empirically. In the experiments reported here and in other unpublished studies we have observed hybridization of the pSM/FGl probe only with nucleic acids derived from viruses defined serologically as HCV229E-like. The second important aspect is the sensitivity of the pSMFGl probe. Our data indicate that approximately 50 pg of intracellular viral RNA can be detected under the conditions used. Taking into account the size of the HCV genome and the probe, this would translate into approximately lo4 genome equivalents. It was therefore quite surprising to find that using essentially similar conditions, a clear hybridization signal could be obtained from inoculated nasal washings containing only lo1 TCID,, of virus. The most probable explanation for this discrepancy is that in tissue-culture-propagated virus the ratio of infectious to non-infectious viral RNA is low. Our earlier experiments have shown that in the course of a natural infection there is no correlation between the infectious virus titre in nasal washings and the amount of viral RNA as determined by hybridization [Myint et al., 19891.
