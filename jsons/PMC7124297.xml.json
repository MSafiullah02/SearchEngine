During the infant period from 2 to 6 weeks of age, life-threatening diseases, such as juvenile hypoglycemia, parasitism (internal and external), trauma, or dehydration from diarrhea, are often seen.2, 4 Weakness, tremors, seizures, stupor, or coma can indicate severe hypoglycemia.2, 7 When hypoglycemia is suspected or confirmed, rapid treatment with intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) glucose solution is imperative, along with monitoring and follow-up care. Infestation with fleas or parasitism with hookworms can result in severe anemia in these very small animals, seen clinically as listlessness, tachycardia, and pale mucous membranes. Dehydration often follows quickly from diarrhea of any cause, such as overfeeding, improper nutrition, parasites, or other infections (Box 1\n). During the juvenile period of 6 to 12 weeks, maternal antibody is waning, resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases.4 Even pups vaccinated during this juvenile period may not be protected when there is just enough maternal antibody to interfere with vaccine response or when only a single dose of vaccine has been recently administered. Among the most common juvenile infections of puppies and kittens are canine parvovirus and feline panleukopenia; these lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia, all of which predispose to severe dehydration and hypovolemia.Box 1Infectious causes of diarrhea that can result in profound dehydration in the juvenile patient\n1.Parasitisma.Coccidiosisb.Giardiasisc.Hookwormsd.Roundworms\n2.Viral infectionsa.Parvovirusb.Coronavirusc.Rotavirus\n3.Bacterial infectionsa.\nSalmonella\nb.\nClostridia\nc.\nCampylobacter\nd.\nEscherichia coli\n\n4.Nutritiona.Overfeedingb.Inappropriate milk replacer (eg, cow\u2019s milk)c.Improper handling of the milk replacer dietd.Lactose intolerance\n\n",

Dehydration refers to a water deficit in the interstitial and intracellular fluid compartments, whereas hypovolemia is a state of decreased intravascular volume that can occur with or without dehydration. Severe dehydration leads to hypovolemia as fluid is pulled from the intravascular space into the interstitial and intracellular tissues. Because of their higher body water needs, this can happen quickly in young pups and kittens such that critically ill pediatric patients are at risk for rapid progression from dehydration to hypovolemic shock. They require appropriate fluid therapy to ensure survival.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, the small size and physiologic differences between pediatric patients and mature animals can make clinical assessment of fluid status more difficult in these young patients.8 For example, dehydration is typically graded as 5% to 7% in animals with \u201ctacky\u201d mucous membranes, but tiny mouths and frequent nursing can interfere with assessment of oral mucous membranes. Skin tenting occurs at approximately 7% dehydration, but excess loose skin can affect this determination, and pups less than 6 weeks maintain skin turgor even when dehydrated.8 Sunken globes are described at approximately 9% dehydration, and dull corneas at approximately 10% to 11%, but pups and kittens do not open their eyes until they are 1 to 2 weeks old. Clues to hypovolemia usually include mucous membrane color and capillary refill time, pulse quality, and jugular venous defensibility. Each of these is far more difficult to gauge in very young animals. The other clue frequently used to assess volume status is heart rate, but heart rate in pediatric patients does not respond to volume change in a manner equivalent to mature animals. As difficult as it may be to gauge dehydration and hypovolemia, it is likewise difficult to judge overhydration. Signs of volume overload can include serous nasal discharge, chemosis (eg, particularly in the conjunctival region), tachypnea, altered breathing pattern, restlessness, cough, tachycardia, ascites, pulmonary crackles on auscultation, and polyuria. Careful monitoring of body weight, often several times per day, is absolutely crucial in neonates and helpful in all pediatric patients.",

Pediatric patients lack the compensatory mechanisms to increase heart rate in an attempt to maintain cardiac output.12, 13 In the neonate, cardiac output cannot be increased by increasing cardiac contractility, because only 30% of fetal cardiac muscle is made up of contractile elements.12 Puppies also seem to have fewer sympathetic nerve fibers supplying the myocardium than adults.12, 13 As a result, tachycardia in response to hypovolemia may not occur as it would in an older patient with hypovolemia.",

Although the brain of all animals depends primarily on glucose as an energy source, lactic acid and ketones can be used as substitutes. The lack of fat and the time required to produce ketones prevents ketone bodies from being a substitute energy substrate in juveniles.19 As a result, pediatric patients should have frequent blood glucose monitoring. Bolus administration of glucose is often indicated during the acute presentation of weak pups and kittens (see fluid dosing). Routine ongoing dextrose supplementation in IV or IO fluid therapy should be considered for all pediatric patients that are not receiving complete and adequate enteral nutrition.",

Examples include the natural colloids; plasma or whole blood; and synthetic colloids, such as hydroxyethyl starch and dextrans. Colloids are often used during volume resuscitation when crystalloids alone fail, or in patients with severe hypoalbuminemia. Young animals may have lower serum albumin and globulin concentrations compared with adults, and hypoalbuminemia is often exaggerated by disease, and especially by blood loss. Recent evidence has suggested that the use of synthetic colloids may potentially increase the risk of acute kidney injury in humans and dogs,23 but this has not been investigated specifically in pups or kittens. Because of the relatively large volume of plasma required to improve colloid osmotic pressure (ie, it requires approximately 22.5 mL/kg plasma to increase albumin by 0.5 g/dL in a dog), plasma is not generally used specifically for its colloidal properties in mature animals.24 However, the use of plasma as a source of colloidal support and fluid volume might be a viable consideration in small pediatric patients because they tolerate high relative fluid volumes and require small absolute fluid volumes. The use of plasma entails some risk of transfusion reaction or transmission of infectious disease, but naturally occurring antibodies in the administered plasma may offer limited benefit to neonatal patients deprived of colostrum.25, 26 Canine albumin, or less ideally human albumin, are other options for colloidal support.

Queens with type B blood have strong naturally occurring antibodies against type A blood. When these queens are bred to type A males, colostrum ingested by any resulting type A kittens may cause life-threatening hemolysis.28 Clinical signs include tail tip necrosis, icterus, pale mucous membranes, listlessness, \u201cfading,\u201d or sudden death. Ideally, kittens should be removed from the queen for the first 24 hours after birth to prevent colostrum ingestion but if neonatal isoerythrolysis has already occurred, transfusion of washed red blood cells may be required. Initially, cells from the type B queen can be given at a dose of approximately 5 mL per kitten (IV, over several hours) because the circulating antibodies attack type A blood.28 If further transfusions are required more than 3 days postpartum, the type A kitten may have formed antibodies to type B blood.

A stomach tube (eg, 5F or 8F premeasured red rubber catheter) is used for oral fluid administration. The tube should be measured from the tip of the nose to the last rib, and the tube marked accordingly. Although the gag reflex is not present until 10 days of age, passage down the left side of the mouth allows for easy feeding of milk replacer, dextrose solution, or water. A small amount of water should be administered via the stomach tube first, making sure that it does not come out through the nares. Once the stomach tube is confirmed to be in the appropriate location, an appropriate amount of commercial milk replacer can be used. The exact amount depends on the labeled instructions and should be adjusted every several days for weight gain. Normal stomach volume is approximately 40 mL/kg to 50 mL/kg, and overfeeding must be avoided.2, 5, 8, 30 The fluid should be warmed to near body temperature, and administered over a few minutes. In general, 10 mL can be fed to a puppy every 2 to 4 hours, whereas for kittens, 5 mL can be fed every 2 to 4 hours. The amount of feeding is increased by 1 mL per day in puppies and kittens.2 After delivery of fluid, kink the tube before withdrawal to prevent aspiration pneumonia.

Aseptic technique and catheter care is imperative. Although placement of IV catheters is challenging, they offer instantaneous access to the vascular compartment for administration of all fluid types.

If no syringe or fluid pump is available, intermittent bolus therapy is often a better option than relying on a drip set alone for CRI.
