The sheer magnitude of numbers coupled with high virulence of the infection has triggered country wide lockdowns across vast swathes of the globe. One group expected to work as usual in these trying times are health care workers and, therefore, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of frontline health care workers is gaining legitimate attention (Ayanian, 2020; Lai et al., 2020) . In this regard, we point out a few moral and ethical dilemmas that can be faced by health care workers (HCW) while attending the call of duty: J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2. Dilemma 2 -Should I retain ventilatory support for a critical patient who is unlikely to survive or use the ventilator for a less critical patient with better prognosis? As much as doctors are bound by the Hippocratic oath that entrusts every doctor to treat all sick patients to the best of their abilities, in times such as these, triaging of finite resources is a pragmatic consideration. Consequently, frontline HCW's may find themselves in an unpleasant situation where they have to make a choice of allocating scant resources for those who need them the most.",

As these thoughts pre-occupy the mind, juxtaposed with other considerations such as looking after the needs of their families, their own physical and mental health care needs, as well as day to day demands of work and caregiving, judgment of HCW's may become clouded.

Institutions need to be upfront about their plans, policies and standard operating procedures to its staff and health care workers. Availability of patient care, safety equipment and risk stratification protocols must be communicated clearly and updated on institutional websites. All health care workers should be briefed periodically about the rational use of PPE so that their safety concerns are addressed and at the same time, resources are utilized rationally. There must not be any attempt to paper over cracks; instead an open admission of possible shortcomings and steps taken to overcome them will allay anxieties and allow HCW's to mentally prepare themselves for challenges. As COVID-19 duty is admittedly stressful, institutions may consider giving reduced shift hours (for instance, 4-6 hours) per work day to prevent burnout.",

It also provides a forum for HCW, who may feel overwhelmed from time to time by the demands of caring, to discuss ongoing concerns and help to prevent burnout. As mentioned earlier, every HCW matters and their mental health often correlates with workplace productivity (Duffield et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2018) . Health care team leaders should be trained to recognise signs of burnout among junior doctors as early identification and intervention is key (Greenberg et al., 2020) . 5. Ultimately, personal health is an individual responsibility. If an HCW has respiratory symptoms and does not wish to endanger others, the onus is on them to stay back and give a proper explanation for their decision. When in doubt, it is desirable to apply the ethical self-test as follows; \"If my colleague at work had these symptoms, would I prefer him to come for duty?\" Setting out standard operating procedures for HCW's J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in this regard would remove ambiguity, facilitate individual decisions and lessen discrimination.",
