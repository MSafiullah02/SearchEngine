Auto-HSCT facilitates the prompt reconstitution of a markedly depleted or ablated marrow following very aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy intended to eradicate hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies.",

Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR) reported a total of 8860 allogeneic transplants in the USA in 2010.

Immunosuppressive therapy is subsequently administered to prevent or treat GvHD. The conditioning regimen serves two purposes: to eliminate malignant cells and to diminish the recipient\u2019s immune response and thereby prevent the rejection of the donor hematopoietic cells [21]. Currently, reduced intensity conditioning regimens have expanded the pool of recipients, especially older patients who poorly tolerated the associated toxicity, and lowered transplant-related mortality, although this advantage is offset by higher relapse rates [21]. Further details pertaining to procedures and other therapeutic measures are available in several detailed publications [1, 19, 21, 22].",

For the lymphoma patients, the bone marrow is evaluated to ensure absence of disease prior to autologous HSCT. In the setting of aplastic anemia, mimics such as myelodysplastic syndrome must be ruled out. Also important is assessing the presence of any fibrosis in the marrow that may delay engraftment [26, 27]. Secondly, the possibility of preexisting hepatic disease should be evaluated in selected patients as it may portend the development of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (previously termed veno-occlusive disease) and related entities discussed in detail below [27].",

These occur most frequently in the bone marrow, but other organs such as the liver, heart, and lungs may be affected; these complications occur early on after transplantation. The pathologist also has a critical role in diagnosing other complications such as immunologically mediated later on post-HSCT. Looking for possible infections posttransplant must always be part of the assessment and differential diagnosis of any biopsy performed to assess organ dysfunction following HSCT. Infections should be sought for diligently with appropriate histochemical and immunohistochemical stains, and be correlated with microbiological findings [28\u201330]. Also important is the assessment of potential reactions to the panoply of drugs the patients usually receive. Lastly, the pathologist is vital in the diagnosis of posttransplant recurrence of the primary malignancy and in the detection of \u201cde novo\u201d neoplasms; on the topic of de novo\nposttransplant malignancies, the reader is referred to chapter \u201cTransplantation and Malignancy\u201d.",

The latter was re-evaluated and clarified in the NIH 2014 consensus project and \u201coverlap syndrome\u201d is now defined as the occurrence of one or more acute manifestations of GvHD in a patient with chronic GvHD. The acute component can occur concurrently with or following the initial diagnosis of chronic GvHD [33]. The incidence of chronic GvHD varies greatly, from less than 10 % to 80 % depending on a wide range of factors [32, 39]. The principal features of chronic GvHD mimic several autoimmune and immunologic disorders, including scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, immune cytopenias, and chronic immunodeficiency.",

In general because the prevalence of chronic GvHD in patients with stem cell transplants is high, the positive predictive value of a biopsy showing GvHD is high, whereas the negative predictive value is low. The relatively high rate of false negatives may be explained by sampling issues or tissue adequacy or by the fact the alterations can be focal in distribution, or altered by concomitant therapy [41]. Nevertheless, despite these shortcomings, biopsies serve a useful purpose in the assessment of patients after HSCT, particularly when the findings are combined with careful clinical correlation.",

There is restoration of megakaryocytic elements usually arranged in clusters and displaying dysplastic or hypolobated nuclei. There is frequently a mild increase in reticulin fibers (Fig. 2). Of note, the centrally located early regenerating erythroid colonies are often associated with activated macrophages (so-called pseudo-Gaucher cells) that are thought to promote recovery of erythropoiesis [48]. By week 3, megakaryocytes are present and the expansion and maturation of all three lineages proceed, so that by the end of the first month, the marrow cellularity should reach 50\u2013100 % of normal with near complete resolution of necrosis and reticulin deposition. By 2\u20133 months, complete regeneration with normal trilineage hematopoiesis is established (Fig. 3).

The marrow morphology resembles that seen in the first week following transplant with a predominance of plasma cells, histiocytes, and mesenchymal cells. Persistence of a hypocellular/aplastic marrow may result from failure or delay in engraftment. A markedly fibrotic marrow pre-transplant may delay engraftment. Alternatively, this complication may be due to GvHD in the marrow as a consequence of alloreactive donor T-cells. Of note, the marrow is much less frequently involved by GvHD than the other organs as discussed below. The manifestations of GvHD in the marrow are not very specific. Apart from the reduced myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic elements, their progenitor cells are characteristically decreased, as are fibroblastic progenitors and stromal cells, reflecting a derangement of the recipient\u2019s microenvironment important in sustaining the donor cells (Fig. 4) [51]. Another feature of GvHD, particularly chronic, can be an increase in marrow T-cells [43].\n",

Stringent assessment of the marrow for overt or minimal residual disease (MRD) is therefore mandatory after HSCT. Likewise knowledge of the chimeric status of the transplant in the setting of allogeneic HSCT is essential. For example, complete chimerism (i.e., 100 % of the cells in the marrow are of donor origin) is a marker of complete remission. Mixed chimerism (with 5\u201390 % of cells of donor origin and the balance from the recipient) raises the possibility of relapse. The presence of a small number of malignant cells, particularly leukemic cells, indicates a failure of the conditioning regimen. Therefore it is imperative to evaluate for MRD and to differentiate it from normal hematopoiesis in the host. A detailed discussion of the topics of MRD and chimerism in HSCT is beyond the scope of this book and chapter but is provided by several excellent sources [45, 53\u201356].\n\n",

There are a number of published variations of this grading scheme [62, 67, 68]. These criteria can be used to estimate the severity of acute GvHD and be incorporated into the pathology consultation report. The pathologist should bear in mind that the histopathologic grade does not necessarily correlate well with the overall clinical severity of the acute GvHD, particularly early after transplantation [65, 69]. Serial biopsies may be useful to consolidate the diagnosis.",

The proper assessment of chronic GvHD requires a full-thickness skin biopsy to evaluate alterations in the dermis, sweat glands, subcutaneous fat, and fascia. The findings can be classified into four principal groupings [27, 41, 72]. The earliest or lichen planus\u2013like changes are characterized by epidermal acanthosis, orthorkeratosis, hypergranulosis with epidermal\u2013dermal lichenoid changes (inflammation, apoptosis and vacuolization of keratinocytes, shortened rete ridges), inflammation of eccrine glands with or without a component of panniculitis. The second phase comprises the sclerotic manifestations (lichen sclerosus-like), usually but not always preceded by the lichen planus-like changes. There is progressive deposition of collagen in the deeper layers, resulting in thickening of the papillary and/or reticular dermis, with or without panniculitis. The third group, morpheic changes, manifests as localized dyspigmented lesions and is characterized by sclerosis in the lower reticular dermis or along the lower dermal\u2013hypodermal border, with or without involvement of the epidermis and appendages. In the fasciitis pattern there is thickening of the fascial septa by inflammation and fibrosis, with or without panniculitis. Typically the epidermis is not involved.",

In contrast drug reactions are characterized by an eczema-like pattern with spongiosis, few if any apoptotic cells, and more numerous lymphocytes. However, on occasion, a severe drug reaction resulting in a Steven-Johnson syndrome with formation of bullae or denudation may render the differentiation from GvHD difficult or impossible. Although eosinophils are typically touted as hallmarks of a drug reaction, they may be present also in GvHD [76]. Of interest, however, Weaver and Bergfeld [77] found that they could rule out a diagnosis of acute GvHD when they found more than 16 eosinophils per 10 high-power fields.\n",

Secondly, the presence of numerous epidermal apoptotic bodies and of lymphocyte satellitosis, particularly in skin appendages, raises the distinct possibility of GvHD. Thirdly, serial skin biopsies may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Fourthly, the diagnosis of GvHD by cutaneous biopsy may be enhanced by the presence of extracutaneous findings such as hyperbilirubinemia and diarrhea [84].

The lung is at risk for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections on account of the perpetual contact with the external environment. Moreover, as the patients are immunocompromised, the normal morphologic patterns of response to infection may be altered, diminished, or even nonspecific. The lung is also at risk for multiple concurrent injuries such as infection, GvHD, and/or drug reaction and the constellation of morphologic findings might consist of variable acute and chronic inflammation, DAD, alveolar hemorrhage, or interstitial inflammatory infiltrates with possible superimposed granulation tissue and fibrosis. Finally, it should be noted that the pathologist faces additional challenges due to the limited tissue samples that are submitted e.g., from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endoscopic or CT-guided biopsies, transbronchial biopsies (TBBx) or video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) biopsies.

The fiberoptic TBBx yields sufficient tissue samples to evaluate for patterns of injury and infectious agents. The VATS biopsy is generally reserved for patients who have failed conventional therapies or are suspected of having more than one etiology to account for the radiologic alterations. Regardless of the specimen obtained, a thorough search for infectious agents such as fungal infections including Pneumocystis jiroveci (PJP), Candida and Aspergillus species, and viruses such as CMV, Herpes simplex and Varicella zoster, as well as more uncommon organisms such as Toxoplasma gondii should be performed [90]. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections remain the most common causes of infection and tissue or fluid Gram stains, microbiologic cultures and molecular sequencing are helpful. Mycobacterial infections are much rarer and usually represent reactivation episodes rather than de novo infections. We routinely perform silver-based stains such as the Gomori-methanamine silver (GMS) stain on BAL samples and tissue sections to exclude PJP or other fungal organisms. Immunohistochemical staining for viruses and Toxoplasm gondii. may be performed routinely or as indicated [91].

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is classified into three subtypes: (1) genetic or congenital forms due to mutations in surfactant proteins or granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor genes; (2) autoimmune (formerly called primary or idiopathic PAP) (~90 % of cases), wherein anti-GM-CSF antibodies block the activation of alveolar macrophages and (3) secondary forms of PAP most frequently due to toxic exposures, chronic infections (e.g., PJP and other fungi, Nocardia, mycobacteria, CMV, and other viruses), immune deficiencies or hematological disorders [112, 113]. The latter category includes a small number of cases of PAP that have been reported following HSCT in which the putative pathogenesis may involve a combination of the depletion and dysfunction of macrophages related to the profound cytopenia and/or to anti-GM-CSF antibodies generated as part of the immune disparity between donor and recipient [114\u2013116].",

PVOD shares pathogenetic mechanisms with PAH, specifically the role of chemotherapy and radiation used in conditioning, and the immune-mediated damage. To date, most published cases of PVOD develop in allogeneic rather than autologous HSCT. The pathologic findings in PVOD, often discovered only at autopsy, include irregular and often eccentric intimal fibrosis with formation of luminal septa, recanalization, and with variable obstruction of pulmonary venules and small veins, less frequently of larger veins (Fig. 15c, d, e). Secondary congestion of capillaries, arterial intimal fibrosis, and medial hypertrophy may ensue, manifesting clinically as pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension.

In descending order of frequency these consist of membranous glomerulonephritis, minimal-change disease, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Although it has been suggested that membranous glomerulonephritis is a glomerular expression of GvHD [128], its occurrence in autologous HSCT as well as in allogeneic HSCT appears to cast some doubt on that notion.

Additionally, GI mucosal damage further exacerbates the inflammatory process by releasing endotoxins that amplify and propagate the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [137]. Epithelial stem cells, residing in intestinal and gastric crypts are preferentially targeted by donor cytotoxic lymphocytes. Eosinophils and granulocytes are also recruited in GvHD [138].",

            "text": "It should be emphasized that the diagnosis of GI GvHD requires close clinicopathologic correlation because the histologic features are nonspecific. Acute GI GvHD occurs throughout the GI tract, but is least common in the esophagus [150]. The classic finding in acute GvHD is the apoptotic body within the epithelium. Apoptotic bodies can manifest as hyperchromatic karyorrhectic nuclear debris within a large clear halo (so-called \u201cexploding crypts\u201d) or as a shrunken cell with a condensed (pyknotic) nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm [41] (Figs. 16 and 17). In the esophagus, apoptotic bodies are in the form of densely eosinophilic dyskeratotic keratinocytes; there may also be a lichenoid interface inflammatory infiltrate, sloughing, and other nonspecific changes in the squamous mucosa (see Table 3). Elsewhere in the GI tract, the apoptotic bodies are within glandular or crypt epithelium, forming intracytoplasmic vacuoles filled with karyorrhectic nuclear debris. In gastric body biopsies, these apoptotic bodies are usually found at the neck of glands where they interface with the gastric pit. In antral biopsies, apoptotic bodies are most often seen in the deep glands [151]. Focally enhanced gastritis, defined as a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, in some cases with neutrophils, surrounding a small group of foveolae or glands without apoptosis is associated with but not diagnostic of GvHD [152]. In the small intestine, colon, and rectum, the deep crypt cells show apoptosis. When these apoptotic bodies are particularly prominent, the term \u201cexploding crypts\u201d has been used [153]. Other findings in more severe cases include dilated crypts, luminal debris, crypt abscesses, crypt destruction, mucin depletion, regenerative surface epithelium, loss of Paneth cells, Paneth cell metaplasia, a periglandular mononuclear cell infiltrate, and ulceration/denudation. Neuroendocrine cells are generally spared damage and form small clusters at the base of the mucosa [41] (Figs. 18 and 19). The salient findings are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n",

Currently, the consensus favors a minimum of >1\u20132 apoptotic bodies per biopsy piece as the minimum diagnostic criterion because it increases sensitivity albeit with some loss of specificity [41, 154] (Fig. 18). Unfortunately, due to the patchiness of injury along the GI tract, the rate of false negative error in diagnosis remains a concern. It has been suggested that at least eight and up to 20 serial sections should be reviewed to minimize the risk of missing infrequent apoptotic bodies [41]. Multiple biopsies along the GI tract may also improve the diagnostic yield. Currently, several histologic grading systems have been proposed. These schema, such as the Lerner [66] and the Sale modification [27] serve as useful descriptors but do not necessarily reflect clinical severity; all four grades may be associated with severe symptoms and extensive endoscopic involvement.",

In particular, MMF-related toxicity causes ulcerative esophagitis, reactive gastropathy, and colonic architectural disarray; in the bowel it leads to increased apoptosis, crypt dilatation with accumulation of luminal debris [160]. However, unlike acute GvHD where neuroendocrine cells are spared, MMF therapy leads to loss of neuroendocrine cell nests [41]. Reflux esophagitis may also need to be excluded. Inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease should be considered in the setting of chronic architectural disarray and in the appropriate clinical context [161, 162].",

The role of the pathologist is twofold: firstly, to distinguish GvHD from other causes of liver dysfunction such as drug toxicity and infection, especially in cases where there are atypical or confounding clinical features [174], and secondly, to identify the minimal criteria for active GvHD [40]. Owing to the patchy and irregular distribution of bile ductal involvement, liver biopsies for GvHD have a sensitivity of 66 % and specificity of 91 % [172]. Thus, in cases with normal histologic findings, clinicians may elect to treat patients for hepatic GvHD on the basis of clinical findings alone. Other confounding factors in the diagnosis of hepatic GvHD are listed in Table 4. There is little evidence to support the use of a liver biopsy as a screening tool or to assess response to therapy for GvHD [40]. However, the extent of bile duct damage and inflammation does correlate with liver function tests, and in some cases with outcomes and survival [41].\n",

These classic morphologic findings may be altered by the type and duration of immunosuppression, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid and any underlying liver disease. At a minimum, evidence of bile duct damage should be present. Lymphocytic portal infiltrate, lobular infiltrate, and prominent necroinflammatory activity can also be seen at any stage, most notably after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy [27]. In small biopsy specimens or cases where tissue was acquired early in disease progression, these findings may be minor or even absent [177, 178].

The histopathologic features of chronic hepatic GvHD can also overlap with those of acute GvHD and the transition between the two may be subtle. The presence of marked biliary ductopenia and portal fibrosis suggest chronicity [132] but still a potentially reversible process [180]. In summary, the current criteria for chronic hepatic GvHD include ductopenia, portal fibrosis, chronic cholestasis but these are not specific for the disease (Fig. 22). Prolonged GvHD gives rise to a more pronounced cholestatic pattern in which canalicular bile plugs, pigment-laden macrophages and hepatocyte ballooning degeneration can be seen. It is not uncommon to observe also bile ductular proliferation (ductular reaction). Chronic hepatic GvHD rarely progresses to frank cirrhosis and this finding warrants extensive clinical and pathologic workup for other etiologies such as hepatitis C viral infection [181\u2013184]. Parenthetically, other than the presence of bile ductular proliferation, the changes of GvHD in the liver closely resemble those found in chronic rejection of the liver allograft (see chapter \u201cLiver Transplantation\u201d).\n",

Table 7 lists the important entities to consider in the setting of HSCT and abnormal liver function. Notably, CMV, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus I/II should be ruled out as potentially treatable causes. Drugs, including cyclosporine, can cause a mild increase in bilirubin by altering bile transport [189]. As there is no definitive histologic pattern of this drug-related etiology, discontinuation of the drug(s), if possible, is helpful in establishing the cause. Sepsis can cause a cholestatic pattern of injury, resulting, in some cases in cholangitis lenta [190]. In the setting of hepatic GvHD and severe concomitant gastrointestinal GvHD, a severe bile ductular reaction with dilated ductules filled with bile pigment and fibrosis can occur and morphologically overlap with cholangitis lenta. In cases where viral hepatitis is suspected, the qualitative assessment of bile duct injury may be useful. Hepatitis C virus tends to incite focal rather than diffuse bile duct injury and has prominent lymphoid aggregates.\n",

Iron overload can arise from repeated blood transfusions and by increased intestinal iron absorption secondary to ineffective hematopoiesis. Many patients, due to the nature of their underlying disease, present with a 1.25 fold increase in iron stores [194, 195]. This can increase the risk for systemic opportunistic infections and has been associated with a reduced overall survival [196\u2013198]. Iron overload has also been implicated in the early development of SOS following HSCT [192]. A serum ferritin level over 1000 ng/mL is considered an adverse prognostic factor [199]. Prussian blue staining reveals increased iron in parenchymal cells (i.e., hepatocytes) and variably in mesenchymal cells (i.e., macrophages and endothelial cells) (Fig. 23) [200]. The pathologist should indicate the degree or \u201cgrade\u201d of iron deposition and qualify its location (parenchymal vs. mesenchymal vs. mixed). The grade of iron in the liver can be assessed using either the semi-quantitative Scheuer system or more recent modifications [201\u2013203]. Identifying iron overload in patient post-HSCT is particularly important because phlebotomy and chelation therapies can improve survival [193]. Hepatic iron overload can be superimposed on opportunistic infections such as Listeria monocytogenes, Mucormycosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and non-cholera Vibrio species [195, 204, 205].\n",

Between 3 and 5 days, there was marked sinusoidal and central venous endothelial damage with sloughing and downstream embolization into the sinusoids and subsequent obstruction, associated with predominantly centrilobular hemorrhage and coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes (Fig. 24) [224]. Livers at days 6\u20137 show deposition of subendothelial and adventitial fibrosis mediated by proliferation of stellate cells and of subendothelial fibroblasts.
