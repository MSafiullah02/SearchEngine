The secondary spread that occurred, predominantly in acute care hospitals, was largely attributed to a failure to recognize a new respiratory syndrome along with the associated delay in assuming appropriate infection control precautions soon enough. Fortunately, the spread of SARS to elderly residents of long-term care facilities was limited. However, transfer of patients to a nursing home did lead to a secondary spread in Hong Kong (2). The incubation period of SARS, estimated to range from 2 to 10 days, with a mean incubation period of 6 days, is sufficiently long enough for some people to be pre-symptomatic on admission and later develop symptoms. Importantly, there is no evidence that individuals who are asymptomatic can transmit the virus. The incidence of asymptomatic infection appears to be very low. In fact, in the Toronto outbreak fewer than 2% of healthcare workers, who had multiple exposures to SARS patients, developed serological evidence of infection.",

This figure is not particularly high as compared with the reproductive numbers of other respiratory viruses spread by respiratory droplet aerosol such as influenza or measles. The clinical experience with SARS reflects this (i.e., once appropriate infection control precautions are instituted, the virus can promptly be contained and transmission stopped). The fact that SARS, unlike influenza for example, is not efficiently transmitted in the community supports this as well. The notable exceptions to the lack of community transmission was the spread at the Hotel Metropol, where it is hypothesized that the virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vomit near the index case\u2019s room or elevator may have been the source of environmental transmission. Community spread also occurred at Amoy garden, an apartment complex, in Hong Kong; the leading hypothesis in this case was that that sewage contaminated with small virus-containing droplets entered the bathrooms of the apartment complex through dried-up U traps (4). A comprehensive review of all the cases of SARS in Hong Kong showed that the transmissibility of viral infection was low, with the exception of settings where intimate contact or where clinically significant contamination occurred (5).",

For example, a retrospective cohort study in a Toronto hospital revealed that assisting with intubation as well as suctioning prior to intubation was associated with a fourfold risk of acquiring SARS among critical care nurses (7). Manipulation of an oxygen mask resulted in a ninefold increased risk to nursing staff. Studies to further define risk factors among household contacts and hospitalized patients are ongoing.",

Coronoviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses known to cause illness in both animals and humans. The virus belongs to a new group within the coronavirus family. An important feature of the SARS-CoV is that, unlike other respiratory viruses, the viral load increases until about the tenth day of illness, and then it diminishes (4). This has implications for infection control precautions and also clinically ones. If a case is put into isolation before the viral load has peaked, then the chance of secondary transmission can be lessened. Clinically, after the first week of illness, one often sees a worsening of symptoms. Molecular epidemiologic studies reveal that the SARS-CoV from outbreaks in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Toronto, and Taiwan are clonally related whereas those from Guangdong province are more diverse genetically (4). This may imply that some molecular lineages are more likely to be transmitted than others.",

Unfortunately, this syndrome is nonspecific, and the clinical features cannot be used to distinguish it from other viral or bacterial respiratory syndromes. The most common symptom is fever, occurring in virtually all cases; shortness of breath occurs later in the illness. Some patients have diarrhea; others have nausea and vomiting. In the elderly, SARS may present as an afebrile illness, where malaise and decreased appetite are the main features. Alternatively, it can present with a low-grade fever with few respiratory symptoms (8). When compared with younger patients who have SARS, older patients are less likely to present with fever, chills, and diarrhea (9).

            "text": "There are a number of factors associated with a poor prognosis in SARS (see Table 1). An important factor is older age; studies have shown that older patients are at substantially higher risk of death. In a study from China, the mortality rate among patients aged 50 years and over was 13 times that for patients aged <50 years (10). In another study, every 10-year increase in age was associated with twofold increase in death (11). In a study from Hong Kong, multivariate analysis revealed that those who are older than 60 years (relative risk, 5.10; confidence interval (CI), 2.30\u201311.31]; P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 3.8 \u03bckat/L at presentation (relative risk, 2.20 [CI, 1.03\u20134.71]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of mortality (12). Comorbidities, especially diabetes mellitus but heart disease as well, have also been repeatedly demonstrated to be risk factors for adverse outcomes in SARS (4). The aforementioned risk factors were noted in a Toronto study of 196 patients with SARS (13). Thirty-eight (19%) SARS patients became critically ill. The interquartile range age of the 38 patients was 57.4 (39.0-69.6) years. The median duration between initial symptoms and admission to the intensive care unit was 8 (5\u201310) days. Twenty-nine (76%) required mechanical ventilation. At 28 days, mortality was 13 (34%) of 38 patients, and for those requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 13 (45%) of 29. At 28 days, six patients (16%) remained mechanically ventilated. By 8 weeks\u2019 follow-up, two of these patients had died. Patients who died were more often older, had preexisting diabetes mellitus, and on admission to the hospital were more likely to have bilateral radiographic infiltrates (13). High viral load at presentation can also be associated with poor outcomes. In a prospective study from Hong Kong, the following factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61\u201380 years) (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 5.24, 95% CI 2.03\u201313.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44\u20137.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log10 increase in number of RNA copies per milliliter, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.39) (14).\n",

The lack of an accurate real-time diagnostic test allowed SARS to be spread in hospitals around the world. SARS can be diagnosed very accurately retrospectively using serology. That is, antibodies to the virus will appear in over 95% of infected patients at least 21 days (but preferably 28 days) or longer after onset of symptoms. Although this is of important epidemiologic value, it is not helpful to the front-line clinician who must decide if a patient has SARS. A number of groups are working on developing nucleic acid amplification tests such as reverse transcription-PCR; however, none of these tests has proven to have a sufficiently high positive or negative predictive value to date. For example, in one recent report the highest detection rate was 75% between days 5 and 7 of illness (15). Although SARS-CoV is readily cultured, the infection control risks to laboratory workers do not make routine culturing of the virus an attractive option. Other types of assays being studied, including immunoblot assays and radioimmunoassays, are still in a development phase. The utility of individual clinical symptoms in diagnosing SARS is limited. However, clinical prediction rules, where constellation of symptoms and signs are used to diagnose, can be of benefit to clinicians in the setting of a SARS outbreak. For example, in a study from Hong Kong, the sensitivity of a clinical prediction rule was 90%; however, specificity was lower at 62% (16).",

The combination of oral ribavirin and interferon has also been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. High-dose intravenous ribavirin has been used in the treatment of Lassa fever and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The theoretical rationale for using this agent was that it was known to have in vitro activity against other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and influenza; also its use began before the agent of SARS was fully defined. There are no systematic evaluations of efficacy of ribavirin for SARS. However, there are reports of toxicity. In Toronto, 61% of patients with SARS who were treated with ribavirin developed hemolytic anemia. Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesmia were reported in 58 and 46% of patients, respectively (17).",

In 1937, the virus, a type of flavivirus, was first isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in northern Uganda. Outbreaks of West Nile fever and meningoencephalitis have since been described in many parts of the world, including Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (19). The first North American outbreak was in 1999 in New York City (20), where 62 cases of WNv meningoencephalitis were reported. In late August 1999, a physician in Queens, New York, recognized an unusual cluster of elderly patients with viral encephalitis. These cases were initially thought to be St. Louis encephalitis; however, follow-up serologic and virologic investigation revealed that the cases were caused by WNv. Subsequent epidemiologic studies, however, suggested widespread transmission in New York City, with thousands of infections in the city. Sequence data from the infecting virus suggested that it was imported from the Middle East. Since then, there have been annual outbreaks of WNv across the United States and Canada.",
