They evolve the direct contamination of dermis which usually progresses toward fatal septicemia or skin necrosis. The conventional treatment procedure mainly consists of complete irrigation and debridement of the wound, topical administration of broad spectrum antibacterial and antifungal agents, covering the wound by oily ointment to protect it from air contact, painful daily dressing change, and observation of the auto-regeneration of wound by proliferation of both dermal fibroblasts and epithelial keratinocytes and basement membrane reconstruction. Promoting proliferation of these skin cells with protection from air contact until complete healing is the key technology, and collagen membrane has been applied for this. For example, freeze dried atelocollagen in vacuum forms a membrane with random pores, and the pore size into which the cells may proliferate is controlled by the gel concentration and temperature at which it is frozen. Freeze dried collagen gel of 1, 2, and 5% in concentration at \u221220, \u221240, and \u221280 \u2022 C for 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 hours demonstrated that higher concentration produced less and smaller sized pores. Also, the lower temperature and prolonged freezing time decreased viscosity. To produce a collagen membrane with optimal pore size of over 120 \u03bcm which permits penetration and proliferation of dermal fibroblast proliferation, the 2% collagen gel freeze dried at \u221240 \u2022 C for 2 hours and crosslinked by EDC or UV irradiation for 2 hours was found to be recommendable to use as a dermal cell conductive membrane that provides the appropriate viscosity for initial anchorage, and any inflammatory exudate escapes through pores.",

Keratinocytes were overlaid on the composite to mimic anatomy of the dermal cellular structure, but it required about 20 days for the manufacture to be completed and it was therefore not applicable to patients with grade 3 skin wound. On the other hand, Green introduced an advanced method in which dermal fibroblasts were cultured to form monolayer on a collagen coated culture plate and then keratinocyte was directly co-cultured on the fibroblast monolayer in a media containing epithelial growth factor. Nonetheless, this method still required at least a week for the complete fabrication, and employment of growth factors holds a risk of oncogenesis induction.",

This phenomenon can be understood as the porous collagen based membrane can play as a vehicle for dermal autologous cell delivery, and the reconstructed basement membrane, which is a keratinocyte supplying bed in nature, has driven epithelial conduction. Later, a collagen-elastin nanofiber was fabricated as previously described, and the extruded fibers were brought onto collagen gel and crosslinked by EDC. Using nanofiber made it possible to produce a lattice controlled matrix, and uniformly aligned lattices conducted cells to proliferate into the designed lattice pattern [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] (Figs. 8.9-8.16 ).

Through surface oxidization by ozone to modify the PU surface, peroxide groups are easily generated. Those peroxides are broken down by redox-polymerization and provide active species which initiate graft polymerization by reacting with amines in the collagen molecules. Ozone oxidation time and voltage could readily control the amount of peroxide production. Maximum concentration of peroxide was about 10.20 \u00d710 \u22128 mol/cm 2 when ozone oxidation was performed at 60 V for 30 min. After the reaction of PU by ozone oxidation, type I atelocollagen gel was graft copolymerized onto the PU. All the physical measurements on the collagen grafted surface indicated that the PU surface was effectively covered with type I atelocollagen. Interaction of the collagen grafted PU surface with fibroblasts could be greatly enhanced by the surface graft polymerization with type I atelocollagen. Attachment and proliferation of fibroblasts on the grafted type I atelocollagen were significantly enhanced, and it is assumed that the atelocollagen matrix supported the initial attachment and growth of cells. In the early stage of proliferation, collagen synthesis in fibroblasts was not activated and remained at a relatively low level due to the grafted type I atelocollagen, increasing only fibroblast differentiation. The mechanical property of tubular tissue was oriented from the alignment of cells that consists of repeated overlayers of longitudinal and circumferential layers and forms wall thickness. Regarding this result, a double layered PU tubular scaffold grafted with collagen was fabricated to produce an artificial esophagus. PU purification was performed by diluting PU particles in DMAC(dimethyl-acrylamide) solution then precipitating in non-solvent methanol, and drying the precipitate under vacuum for 2 days to remove residual methanol. After purification, PU was dissolved in DMAC solution at the final concentration of 13%w/w. Glass rod, with diameter of 3 mm and length of 15 cm, was worn with 13% PU solution and then air-dried for 6 hours. This process was repeated twice. After wearing, an end part of the glass rod was cut, and then the rod was worn again in reverse direction by the same process to be uniformly worn. It was dried under vacuum for 12 hours afterward. Completely dried sam- ple was swelled in benzene solution for 1 hour and washed with distilled water for 2 hours and ethyl alcohol for 1 hour. After swelling and wearing process, a porous PU tube was separated from glass rod and dried under vacuum. To graft collagen, ozone treatment was performed as described above. The tube was immediately immersed in 1% type I atelocollagen gel, and Mohr's salt [FeSO 4 (NH 4 )2SO 4 6H 2 O] was added to the gel to decompose peroxides. Then polymerization was allowed to proceed at 35 \u2022 C and pH 8.0. Type I atelocollagen grafted porous PU tube was dried in vacuum at 25 \u2022 C. The tube was dipped in a 2% collagen gel and crosslinked by EDC later. By this procedure, a porous collagen-grafted tube with inner diameter of 3 mm, thickness of 0.7 mm covered by dense collagen layer was produced. Rabbit's esophageal smooth muscle cells were seeded and cultured in a mechanically stressful environment of 10% strain magnitude and 1 Hz frequency. Culturing for 18 hours of mechanically stretching condition and 6 hours of stationary condition on every 24-hour period, the cultured cells aligned in the perpendicular direction to the strain direction after 2 days. The collagen grafted PU tube with cell alignment control was subcutaneously implanted in nude mice for 4 weeks, and a histological finding demonstrated that a well-aligned smooth muscle cells reconstructed the tube which is applicable for replacement of esophagus [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ",

At first, glycolide and D,L-lactide were recrystallized from ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum before use. Lactide and glycolide, at a molar ratio of 75:25, were put into a glass ampoule, and mPEG was added for preparing the mPEG-PLGA block copolymer through ring-opening polymerization. 0.05%(w/w) of stannous octoate added to the solution as a catalyst. The ampoule was evacuated by a vacuum pump, sealed with a torch, and was heated in an oil bath at 130 \u2022 C for 12 hrs. After the reaction was complete, resulting polymers were purified by dissolving in methylene chloride and then precipitated in excess methanol.",

In vitro adhesion test revealed that fibroblasts attached better on HA-Col membrane compared to those on mPEG-PLGA film, PLGA film or oxidized cellulose film. mPEG-PLGA film had the lowest cell adhesive property. In confocal microscopic observation, the actin filaments were significantly more polymerized when 50 or 100 \u03bcg/cm 3 fibronectin was incorporated on the HA-Col membranes. After 7-day culture, fibroblasts penetrated throughout the HAFN-Col network and the cell density increased whereas very few cells were found attached on surface of the mPEG-PLGA film. In vivo evaluation by implantation test for 7 days in rabbit's peritoneal wound showed that the composite membrane could protect tissue ",

Liver hepatocyte is a representative stable cell that has tremendous proliferative capacity and ability to differentiate and proliferate when injury or damage occurs in liver. In case of no-proliferation of hepatocytes, oval cells are stimulated to divide and eventually differentiate into mature hepatocytes; therefore, an oval cell is regarded as a compensatory cell in liver injury, and has been concerned to be equivalent to liver stem/progenitor cells. Oval cell is oriented from bone marrow mesenchymal cell, and is a facultative bipotential precursor cell that differentiates into hepatocytes or bile duct cells. Human MSCs harvested from tibial bone marrow and co-cultured with hepatocytes for 3 days in medium with additive hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) produced a confluent mixture of undifferentiated MSCs and oval cells. To purify the oval cells from nonparenchymal cells, cell cloning method was applied. Characterization of oval cells was performed by a double immuno- Observed fiblasts on the PEG-PLGA surface were significantly fewer than on the PLGA membrane surface. Collagen-HA membrane demonstrated high affinity to cell attachment fluorescence method using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and cytokeratin-19 monoclonal antibody expecting co-expression. Isolated human MSCs oriented oval cells were seeded on an EDC crosslinked porous type I atelocollagen matrix, and cultured in medium containing insulin, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone as the hormone stimulators and additive cytokines of HGF and epidermal growth factor (EGF). For Co.) is a commercially available anti-adhesive membrane made by oxidized cellulose 3 weeks, albumin secretion and urea detoxification rate continuously increased either in the hormone additive or the cytokine additive groups, and this was directive knowledge that avoidance of using growth factors in committing MSC-oriented oval cell toward hepatocyte can escape from risky induction to liver cancer. The collagen scaffold was able to foster long-term viability and protection of the cells, and this 3-dimensional culture of oval cells is considerable for designing a cell-delivering tool for hepatic disease [33] (Figs. 8.33-8.38). Asymmetric collagen-fibronectin grafted PEG-PLGA copolymer membrane was appeared to successfully reduce the incidence of postoperative adhesion formation ",

The resource of collagen, especially for clinical applications is also important, because unknown viruses that produce future unpredictable diseases from xenogeneic extracellular matrix may exist. If single-cell encapsulation by collagen containing signal transduction agents and ligands attracting specific cell adhesive receptors is systemized, commitment of stem cell differentiation and proliferation toward the designated target tissue will be achieved, and this may contribute to the future progress of stem cell-based implant.
