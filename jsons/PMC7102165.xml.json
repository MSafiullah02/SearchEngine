            "text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has emerged over the past decades as an important treatment option for several malignant and non-malignant diseases in childhood and adolescence. However, conditioning regimens are potentially limited by severe side effects contributing to significant morbidity and mortality rates. Of the patients, 40% to 60% experience infectious or non-infectious pulmonary complications, accounting for a significant percentage (24%) of transplant related deaths [27] during the first 3 months after transplantation [17]. Depending on whether they occur before or after day 100 posttransplantation, these complications are classified as early or late [13]. Historically, about 50% of all pneumonias observed after HSCT have been attributed to bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Risk factors for bacterial pneumonia include neutropenia and myeloablative therapy [8]. Non-infectious pulmonary complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) develop in 30\u201360% of HSCT patients [2, 23]. Conditioning regimen and graft type has been described to be contributing factors. Yet, the exact underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of these diseases remain unclear, which also makes appropriate treatment rather difficult [2, 13]. However, an association between late-onset non-infectious pulmonary complications (LONIPC) and chronic GvHD have been assumed [23]. Unfortunately, non-infectious lung pathology often responds poorly to standard therapeutic approaches [9], hence identification of predisposing risk factors is crucial for the development of preventive strategies [17].",

Although elevated eosinophil counts have been reported in adults with chronic GvHD, no correlation with outcome could be shown [4]. However, in adults with acute GvHD after HSCT, elevated eosinophils were associated with a better overall survival [19]. Frankovich et al. [12] have reported an association of asthma and atopic history and non-infectious pulmonary complications after autologous HSCT in pediatric Hodgkin patients [11]. However, no prospective studies in a pediatric cohort of allogeneic HSCT patients have been published as yet. The development of asthma after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been observed and described as a plausible phenomenon of transfer from donor to recipient [3, 15, 26]. Adjacent to the different cellular phenotypes, different clinical types of asthma are known, including non-atopic asthma. Some authors even call for regarding asthma as a syndrome rather than a disease because of heterogeneity in pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical symptoms, and response to treatment [5].",

After solid organ transplantation in children, it has been observed that Th2 specific immunologic response is preserved [10], hence Th2 cell related clinical reactions can be observed even in the presence of severe immunosuppression. Upon activation, eosinophilic granulocytes release cytotoxic cellular contents, such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), which has been shown to be a reliable marker for exacerbations in asthmatic patients and to be useful in follow-up of steroid treatment and assessment of asthma severity [20]. Yet, it is not very helpful in diagnosing asthma and its role in other allergic diseases such as rhinitis and atopic dermatitis still remains controversial [7, 18, 21]. ECP levels are not only increased in allergic conditions but also during viral infections and in patients with nasal polyps [22]. However, Koh et al. [20] propose that assessing ECP levels of asthmatic patients is limited to eosinophil patterns and subsequently atopic forms of disease.",

Additionally, day +28 and day +100 were time points when ECP did not correlate with eosinophil granulocytes, which may be due to some hematopoietic dysregulation during engraftment. Eosinophil count correlated with ECP in measurements on days \u221210 and +180. Yet, it has not proven useful in predicting complications or atopy in our patients after prolonged chemotherapy. Of note, eosinophil granulocytes are mostly undetectable in peripheral blood from transplant until engraftment and hematologic regeneration. In those children with elevated ECP at day +28, the onset of acute GvHD was before day +40, hence the increase of ECP seems to precede instantly the immunologic response of GvHD. Therefore, ECP might be a more sensitive marker during hematopoietic engraftment than eosinophilia, even if sensitivity and specificity could not be calculated due to the small cohort.",

This kind of peak phenomenon has been described in previous studies. Ambivalent opinion existed whether IgE peaks indicated an onset of GvHD or occurred due to conditioning regimen [1, 16]. We hypothesize that in these children, elevated IgE may be rather a phenomenon of immunologic dysregulation or upregulation. The finding of an atopy-independent increase of IgE in non-T-cell-depleted children with GvHD may demonstrate that a Th2 response is still preserved also in the presence of severe immunosuppression in pediatric patients after HSCT without correlating with signs and symptoms of atopy. In contrast to total IgE, specific IgE levels decreased after transplant, most likely due to a loss of host antibodies after allogeneic HSCT. Thereby, one always has to consider that these patients usually receive high doses of steroids, for example in a MUD setting during administration of ATG, or as therapy for GvHD.",
