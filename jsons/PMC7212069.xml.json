Findings of a study in Suzhou, China, has shown that fibrinogen level has increased in more than 65% of those with pneumonia due to COVID-19 and the interesting part is that at the level of 4.8 gr/L, the sensitivity of fibrinogen in differentiation of severe patients has been reported to be 100% (7). By studying 192 patients with COVID-19, Zhou et al. introduced D-dimer levels over 1 \u03bcg/mL as a predictor of poor outcome, which can aid physicians in detecting more severe patients in the initial stages (8).",
