The technique used for the prospective and exploratory analysis was the Delphi method. Two rounds of consultations were done with fourteen judges with broad experience in health and safety at work and university teaching who reached a consensus of opinion regarding a list of nine psychosocial risk factors. Among the most important risk factors, mental overload, time pressure, the lack of a schedule, and emotional exhaustion were highlighted. These risk factors are related to the usage and expansion of information and communication technology (ICT) and to the university system itself, which requires initiating more research in the future in order to develop the intervention programs needed to fortify the health of the affected teachers and protect them from stress and other psychosocial risks. of stress and physical (musculoskeletal disorders) and psychological disorders (burnout, anxiety, and depression), with the consequent increase in work absenteeism [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

This is not only because it makes formal and informal communication within the organization more difficult, but also seems to limit the possibilities for organizational promotion and support [24] , which may give rise to disappointment, distress, and alienation [25] .

Specifically, the prior studies show unfavorable differences for women in several factors, like mental overload and difficulties with work-life balance [35] [36] [37] . These differences are associated with a variety of factors linked to the modality of online work and to responsibilities distributed according to gender roles. Working from home increases the number of hours of work [7] and blurs the boundaries between the family and the workplace. In the case of women, schedule is restructured according to family needs, which can be explained from the perspective of traditional gender roles. According to this perspective, women are, mostly, responsible for family duties, thereby generating an overload of work in both fields [38, 39] . Furthermore, women must deal with high levels of stress in both domains, which frequently leads to considering the option to stop working or professional resignation [28] .",

Other aspects were taken into account including work history, specifically, years of experience in the field of health and safety at work and online university teaching. Finally, the degree of motivation was also taken into account. Initially, 25 experts from different areas of Spain who met one of the two requirements mentioned above were contacted by e-mail, and were informed about the aims of the study, the procedure and the tasks to be carried out, and were asked to collaborate by providing more experts who could participate. The research group finally contacted a total of 29 experts. Of this initial group, 15 experts responded to the request, which was finally reduced to 14, as a loss occurred between the first and second consultation rounds. The remaining 14 were the experts who made up the final panel of judges.",

Likewise, after those 12 items were selected, consistent with the specialized literature [45] , the decision was made to select items with a higher figure from among the factors with an assignation percentage below 50%. The 41 items resulting from the first round of analysis that were part of the second questionnaire are shown in Table 2 . In the second round of consultations, and with the data obtained from using a second structured questionnaire, the intention was to advance to the final list of factors for which a consensus was reached. Table 3 shows the frequency and percentage of agreement between the panel members for all 41 items, as well as the mean and standard deviation for each one with an interval of 1-10 over the importance and relevance of the risk factor and the coefficient of variation (CV) obtained. As can be seen, 28 items obtained percentages of agreement between panel members equal to or greater than 60%, which can therefore be considered risk factors. In relation to their importance, as can be observed, they also have a high mean score, above six points, and low variability, with a standard deviation below two points. Only the items (difficulty with work-life balance and level of humidity) that had a higher than established agreement percentage (85.7% and 64.3%, respectively) obtained a degree of importance lower than six and were consequently excluded because they did not meet the required consensus requirement. As shown in Table 3 , in the 26 pre-selected items, an important consensus was been obtained among experts due to low or very low coefficients of variation. In this sense, the guidelines of English and Kernan [46] were followed, whereby a coefficient above 0.80 indicates the need for modifications or a new consultation. Therefore, in the case of this study and in light of the data obtained, the process was considered to be complete.",

The continuous presence of the labor demands related to developing mental fatigue [17] have serious consequences for the cognitive and emotional processes of individuals, whose efficiency and performance are notably reduced [34, 47] . At the same time, this aspect is related not only to the tasks, but also to the main tool of online teaching, namely the effective management of ICTs, which involves permanent training and updating of knowledge, skills, and abilities in the face of the rapid and vertiginous quantitative and qualitative changes in the technological field, in an effort to avoid techno-stress [48] . On the other hand, in the current global pandemic of Covid-19, the importance of this training and updating of online teaching strategies and tools for all educators can be appreciated at the different educational levels, in light of the mandatory cancellation of face-to-face teaching and the difficulties that this is causing for all teachers.",

This is closely related to the tasks assigned to them in accordance with traditional gender roles, which underline their greater responsibility in the family [2] . Most domestic tasks are \"low-control-schedule\" [54] , which means they must be carried out despite interference, so that female teachers try to reorganize their activity around satisfying these family demands, and are forced to increase their schedules thanks to the possibilities of ICTs or, alternatively, reduce family time [38] , as noted above. This eventually leads to work overload and high levels of stress, which are enhanced by the blurred boundaries between work and family, resulting from online education, work spikes, and time pressure linked to short and strict deadlines, all of which make it more difficult to reconcile the two fields.",

Those researchers warn of the risks derived from turning telecommuting into an abstract activity mediated by a computer; in other words, turning it into a dehumanized activity that can eventually cause a significant degradation of social skills for interacting adaptively with others. Since it is usually women who tend to take advantage of teleworking [1] , this lack of social recognition mainly affects them and is linked to the lack of approval of non-domestic work for which they are considered to be the main person responsible. In this sense, Casta\u00f1o [63] states that teleworking may contribute to making women's work invisible, as it is now completely developed in the personal area. Finally, and in agreement with Pocock [64] , it is understood that identifying the reasons why these psychosocial risk factors and the consequences associated with mimicry affect women online teachers more than men (generating higher levels of stress), requires a global approach focused on exploring the interrelations between multiple work, technological, social, and individual factors, which will be the subject of further research.",

A second limitation is related to the absence of procedures, such as calculating a competency index [39] to estimate the level of expert knowledge of the panel selected, for example. Nevertheless, the experts were believed to be trustworthy in their judgements because of their backgrounds and broad professional and academic experience. The third limitation refers to the fact that no analysis was made of the possible existence of differences between the sample of experts according to their sex. Nevertheless, it is considered that the panel of judges, selected for their theoretical and/or practical qualification, was, on the one hand, sufficiently heterogeneous in terms of their origin and type of qualification to collect different perspectives and alternatives of a problem or topic, thus providing a broad knowledge basis and producing high quality constructions; and on the other hand, it was also sufficiently homogeneous in terms of the level and degree of training, such that the number of experts that made up the aforementioned panel was methodologically pertinent to generate discussion and not to hinder the compilation and synthesis of information. A fourth limitation is related to the existence of possible differences between virtual versus semi-virtual work environments, and between private and public university institutions, which have not been verified.",

At an organizational level, realistic changes to teaching loads and deadlines for delivering educational activities should be made. Working from home should be combined with working at the university to facilitate social contact and avoid isolation. Systematic institutionalized study plans should be mandated in which digital skills as well as knowledge related to the knowledge areas of the professors expertise are updated. Appropriate salary policies should be established and labor resources should be provided, such as psychological capital, which help cope with work related stressors and have a positive influence on work performance and psychosocial health [65] . Furthermore, taking actions at home workplaces to adapt them ergonomically and physically is a high priority. On the other hand, at a personal level, it is necessary to reinforce the personal resources of professors, such as working on emotional skills and encouraging healthy habits. ",
