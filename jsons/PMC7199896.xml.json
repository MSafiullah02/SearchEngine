Clinical specimens and epidemiologic data used in the present study were obtained as part of the emergency public health response to the outbreak of SARS; therefore, Federal regulations for human-subject research did not apply, and approval by the Institutional Review Board was not required. The clinical specimens used in this study (table 1) were from 10 case patients meeting the case definition for probable SARS [6] and having laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection [7, 8]. Most of the cases occurred outside mainland China, but many were linked directly or indirectly, through multiple chains of transmission, to a single ill traveler from Guangdong Province, China, who exposed multiple guests at Hotel M in Hong Kong in late February 2003 [9]. The resulting cluster of infections initiated the global spread of SARS. Patient S3 was the Hotel M contact who transmitted the infection to Vietnam. Patient S1 was likely infected through close contact with patient S3 or other early cases of SARS in Vietnam [10]. All other patients in Vietnam (S4\u2013S6) [11], the patient from Canada (S2) [12], and 2 patients from the United States (S8 [13] and S9 [14]) were infected through chains of transmission originating from the Hotel M cluster. Two cases in the present study are not known to be directly linked to the Hotel M cluster: patient S7 developed symptoms after returning home to the United States after a trip to Hong Kong but without known exposure to Hotel M [15], and patient S10 was a secondary contact, in Taiwan, of a traveler to Guangdong, China, who was diagnosed with SARS and who transmitted the illness after returning to Taiwan [16].",

The RT-PCR reactions were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions, with each 50 \u03b5L of RT-PCR reaction mixture containing 5 \u03b5L of extracted nucleic acid sample, 1 \u00d7 Reaction Mix, 2 mmol of MgSO4/L, 0.2 \u03b5g of sense primer, 0.2 \u03b5g of antisense primer, 20 U of RNase inhibitor, and 1 \u03b5L of SSII/Platinum Taq Mix. Reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by a 5-min denaturation at 94\u00b0C. This was followed by 40 cycles of amplification, each consisting of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Amplification was concluded with a single final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Amplification products were visualized on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 \u03b5g of ethidium bromide/mL and were purified by use of a QIAquickPCR purification kit (Qiagen). The 8 RT-PCR products for the S gene were sequenced, in both directions, by use of the same 16 RTPCR primers, and the 2 RT-PCR products for the N gene were sequenced, in both directions, by use of 7 different sequencing primers. Automated sequencing was performed by use of a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, on an ABI PRISM 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled and analyzed by Sequencher software (Gene Code). The sequence of the Urbani strain (GenBank accession number AY278741) of SARS-CoV was used as a reference for all sequence comparisons.",

The clinical specimens from the 10 patients included 1 specimen with no matched SARS-CoV isolate, from 2 patients (S9 and S10); multiple specimens from 3 patients (S2, S3, and S8), and matched specimen/isolate pairs from 6 patients (S1 and S3\u2013S7). The S and N gene sequences of clinical specimens from these 10 patients were compared with those of the original isolate from patient S1 (Urbani), whose sequence had been generated previously and was used as the reference sequence for the present study (table 2). Specimens from all 10 patients showed the same 3768-nt ORF encoding the 1255-aa S protein, as well as the 1269-nt ORF encoding the 422-aa N protein, indicating an absence of frameshifts, insertions, and deletions in these ORFs. There were only 5 nucleotide positions that differed relative to the previously published Urbani sequence; 3 of these sequence variations arose independently, as true mutations, in 3 patients (mutation 29347-G in patient S4, mutation 23445-G in patient S7, and mutation 22570-C in patient S8), and 2 were sequence variations that were present in 2 cultured isolates (mutation 21938-C in the isolate from patient S3 and mutation 24872-C in the isolate from patient S1 [Urbani]) but not in the matched clinical specimens. Of the 3 true substitutions, 2 were observed in specimen/isolate pairs (patients S4 and S7) and 1 was observed in multiple clinical specimens (patient S8). The 2 cell culture-related changes were noted in isolates from patients S1 (Urbani) and S3. The sequence derived from the isolate from patient S1 had a C at nucleotide position 24872, whereas the matched clinical specimen had a T at this position; all other published SARS-CoV sequences had a T at this position, suggesting that a T\u2192C transition was selected during isolation or cell-culture passage of the virus. The sequence derived from the isolate from patient S3 had a C at nucleotide position 21938, and multiple clinical specimens from patient S3 had a T at that position; again, because all other published sequences have a T at this position, it is likely that the C at nucleotide position 21938 in the isolate from patient S3 was selected during isolation or cell-culture passage of the virus.",

Comparison of patients S3 and S9 illustrates this most clearly. Patient S3 represents the starting point for multiple transmission chains emanating from the Hotel M cluster [9]. Although many details of these transmission events remain uncertain, \u223c3 months and at least 4 generations of transmission separate the SARS-CoV infection of patient S3 from that of patient S9, an American visitor to Canada [14]. Despite the time interval and these discrete transmission events, we detected no variation between the SARS-CoV S and N gene sequences of clinical specimens from these 2 patients. We also evaluated SARS-CoV S and N gene genetic stability during the course of infection in a single person, by comparing viral genomes from 4 serial stool specimens obtained, between days 14 and 26 after the onset of SARS, from patient S8, and we found the sequences to be invariant. Finally, we compared sequences amplified from lung, lymph node, and kidney tissues obtained at autopsy of patient S3, the index patient of the Hotel M cluster, and again found no variation in the S and N gene sequences of the SARSCoV present in these different tissues.",

We also identified 2 substitutions in the S gene that were likely to have arisen as a result of cell-culture passage of the virus. The cell culture-related changes underscore the need, when one is analyzing sequence data from isolates, to consider the potential effect of cell-culture changes; for example, 14 SARS-CoV genome sequences based solely on cell culture isolates have been reported to include a total of 127 nucleotide-sequence variations; variations at 4 loci appeared to be phylogenetically significant, and some of them were cell culture-related changes [3].",

First, as is the case with respect to other RNA viruses, it is likely that SARSCoV in humans is represented by a quasi species and that the sequences that we obtained reflect the average sequence in a specimen and may not represent the full spectrum of variants replicating in an individual; however, our data suggest that individual variants are not prominent, because we did not see, at any loci, sequence ambiguity that would suggest the presence of significant heterogeneity. The second limitation is that the specimens studied were from only 10 patients and were only from a period of 3 months. Furthermore, because we limited our analysis to the S and N gene sequences (i.e., only 5037 nt), it is possible that different patterns of variation may be observed in other regions of the SARS-CoV genome [3]; however, both the conservation in the complete genomic sequence of the isolate from S7 and other published data argue against this. Last, the 3 apparent mutations that we identified were not seen in the other patients in the present study or in sequences published elsewhere, and therefore their significance remains unknown.",

These data are consistent with the conclusion by The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium\u2014that is, that the SARS-CoV genome was stable during the late epidemic phase, with emergence of a predominant genotype [4]. Low rates of variation have also been reported for other human coronaviruses (e.g., 229E) [19], whereas still other coronaviruses have been found to have greater variation and higher rates of mutation. If SARS-CoV recurs, it will be important to continue to monitor its clinical, epidemiologic, and genetic patterns, for changes that might be associated with improvements in its ability to infect and replicate in humans and for changes that might present new challenges to the control of it.",
