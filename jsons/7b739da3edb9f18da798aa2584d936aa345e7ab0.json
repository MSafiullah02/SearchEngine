Viral infection leads to an infl ammatory cascade in which T-helper type 1 cytokine polarization is associated with a high level of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2 and interferon-\u03b3. There is also an associated release of proinfl ammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8. These cytokines are considered very potent chemoattractants for neutrophils [ 4 ] . The viral induction of the infl ammatory cascade results in acute mucosal edema, occlusion of sinus ostia, and impairment of mucociliary clearance. The resulting mucus stasis can contribute to a milieu that favors the proliferation of pathogenic micro-organisms, resulting in acute bacterial sinusitis.",

Structural concerns, such as concha bullosa or septal deviation, may be clinically signifi cant. Infl ammatory conditions such as nasal polyposis may predispose to acute sinusitis by gross obstruction of sinus drainage by polyps, as well as by generalized mucosal edema. Environmental exposures should be considered, although the evidence for their associations can be variable. For example smoking is thought to be a risk factor for ARS by disrupting ciliary function [ 1 ] , but the evidence for passive smoke exposure as a signifi cant risk factor is less compelling [ 5 ] . Host immune factors such immunodefi ciency or immunosuppression can be important risk factors, whereas the role of allergy in ARS is the subject of considerable debate, with studies both supporting and challenging its role [ 6 , 7 ] .",

Because the frontal sinus is embryologically derived from pneumatization of the ethmoid, frontal sinus outfl ow is thus infl uenced and defi ned by the degree of pneumatization of the ethmoid labyrinth. A variety of ethmoid-derived structures that comprise the frontal recess can thus narrow the outfl ow tract and predispose to acute frontal sinusitis. These structures may include agger nasi cells anteriorly; the bulla lamella and suprabullar/frontal bullar cells posteriorly; supraorbital ethmoid cells laterally; and type I-IV frontal cells comprising variable spatial orientations within the frontal recess [ 8 ] . A recent study found that the presence of frontoethmoid cells in the posterior and posterolateral aspects of the frontal recess (suprabullar cells, frontal bullar cells, and supraorbital ethmoid cells) may have a more signifi cant association with the development of frontal sinusitis than those cells in the anterior aspect of the frontal recess [ 9 ] .",

If cultures are not possible, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately, choosing broad spectrum agents that have favorable penetration of the blood-brain barrier. As mentioned previously, a signifi cant percentage of cultures from patients with intracranial complications are negative. This may perhaps occur because antibiotic therapy is often initiated emergently before cultures can be obtained. The duration of antimicrobial treatment varies with the nature and severity of the complication, as well as the response to initial therapy. Depending on the degree of morbidity, many patients with complicated acute frontal sinusitis will require continuation of intravenous antibiotic therapy as an outpatient after resolution of the acute phase of illness. Oral antibiotic therapy may be appropriate in selected patients. The use of intravenous corticosteroids in patients with complicated AFS is controversial. Some studies have advocated their use in patients with cerebral edema and clinical deterioration [ 23 ] while others argue that they may interfere with antibiotic penetration and immune response [ 37 ] .

The advantages of trephination include technical simplicity, good effi cacy of decompressing and draining the sinus, and provision of a portal to the sinus lumen for irrigation. Disadvantages of trephination include potential scar from the external incision, potential injury to the supraorbital nerve, and failure to address the critical area of impaired outfl ow of the sinus.",

The endoscopic approach provides a minimally invasive means of improving frontal sinus drainage through its natural outfl ow tract.

In addition, there is a higher risk of post-operative synechia and stenosis of the frontal sinus ostium. Use of silicone stents and creation of Draf 2b cavities has been reported in one study [ 28 ] to achieve a low rate of re-stenosis. Balloon dilation techniques may be an appropriate alternative for surgical enhancement of frontal sinus drainage. \u2022 In recent series, the mortality rate from intracranial complications of frontal sinusitis has been found to have decreased from earlier reports, but remains a notable 5 %.",
