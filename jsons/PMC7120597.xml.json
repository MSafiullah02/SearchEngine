It has been shown that, at the time of seroconversion, HIV-1 can be detected in the CSF; this is the time when, clinically, a subacute meningitis develops, thus, suggesting that HIV-1 enters the CNS at a very early stage of the disease.Opportunistic infectious agents or drugs of abuse disturbing the BBB may further attract more HIV-1-infected T-lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain.",

This activation of microglia is not correlated with the presence of HIV-1 antigen in the brain tissue. Activated microglia/macrophages, rather than MGCs, most probably secrete toxic factors.The neurotoxicity associated with HIV-1 infection is mediated, in part, throughcytokinesarachidonic acid metabolitesproduced during cell-to-cell interactions between HIV-1-infected brain macrophages and astrocytesPathobiological events underlying the neurodegenerative processes in HIV-1-associated dementia are believed to begin with productive infection of monocytes/macrophages by HIV-1.Peripheral activation causes the differentiation of macrophages to produce a variety of immune products that lead to the upregulation of adhesion molecules on brain microvascular endothelial cells and the expression of adhesins on the monocyte-macrophage cell surface.After penetration of the BBB, the differentiated brain macrophages and microglia can be vehicles for viral dissemination throughout the brain and focal reservoirs for productive HIV-1 replication.The neurotoxic events in the brain are caused by neurotoxins produced by these cells which are primed by HIV-1 and secondarily activated by factors such as immune stimuli or by T-cells trafficking through the nervous system.The primed and immune-activated brain macrophages/microglia secrete a variety of factors which affect neural and glial function and eventually lead to CNS inflammation.A pro-inflammatory cytokine response from blood-derived monocytes/macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes is amplified and leads finally to neurodegeneration.Immune neurotoxic factors may contribute to the breakdown of the BBB and affect the generation of chemokines, leading to transendothelial migration of monocytes into the brain perpetuating the inflammatory cascade.As a result of the neurotoxic activities of activated macrophages/microglia, astrocytes may suppress or increasemacrophages/microglia secretory functions and toxicity, depending on the astrocytic functional status.Cytolytic T-lymphocytes serve to eliminate infected cells, but are lost in late-stage HIV-1 disease, allowing the virus-induced, neurodegenerative response to continue unabated.Other factors include:viral proteinsCA2+ channelsNMDA receptorschemokines and cytokinesExpression of developmental proteins (Malik and Eugenin 2016):Dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1): upregulatedRho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2)\u2014upregulatedLow density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 (LRPAP1)\u2014upregulatedLow density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5-like (LRP5L)\u2014downregulatedLow density lipoprotein-related protein 12 (LRP12)\u2014upregulatedLow density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8, apolipoprotein e receptor (LRP8)\u2014downregulatedCatenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha-like 1 (CTNNAL1)\u2014upregulatedCatenin, beta-like 1 (CTNNBL1)\u2014downregulatedCatenin (cadherin-associated protein), delta 1 (CTNND1)\u2014downregulatedCatenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha-like 1 (CTNNAL1)\u2014upregulatedGlycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B)\u2014downregulatedWingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 10A (WNT10A)\u2014downregulatedFor more details, see (Zayyad and Spudich 2015; Singh 2016; Ru and Tang 2017; Rao et al. 2014; Malik and Eugenin 2016; Lamers et al. 2016; Joseph et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2014; Carroll and Brew 2017).",
