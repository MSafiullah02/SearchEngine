The initial study included 309 patients with confirmed SARS recruited from 3 major hospitals that treated patients with SARS in Hong Kong during the 2003 outbreak, namely, Pamela Youde Nethersole Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, and United Christian Hospital. Subsequently, we further recruited 508 patients with SARS from SARS follow-up outpatient clinics in the 3 previously mentioned hospitals and 3 others, namely, Queen Mary Hospital, Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, and Prince of Wales Hospital. All 817 patients with SARS were confirmed by serologic analysis and/or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Their clinical data were retrospectively obtained from Hospital Authority, Hong Kong, with permission from all attending clinicians of the respective hospitals. These included age; sex; length of hospital stay; treatment in intensive care unit (ICU) and duration of ICU treatment; whether patients required assisted ventilation, steroid treatment, pulse steroids, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); and final outcome in terms of survival and death. Because most of the patients were recruited from the SARS follow-up clinics after discharge, the proportion of deaths was small and could not be used as a measure of outcome. Results of hematological and biochemical laboratory investigations on admission were also retrieved. These included hemoglobin level, absolute lymphocyte count, platelet count, WBC count, and biochemical indices of alanine aminotranseferase, albumin, globulin, creatinine kinase, LDH, urea, sodium, potassium, and serum creatinine.",

All 307 who had volunteered for the study remained disease free and were confirmed to be seronegative for SARS at the end of the outbreak. A simple self-administered questionnaire documented the type of wards they had worked in, the duration of work, and whether or not they had performed high-risk procedures such as ambu-bagging, nasopharyngeal suction, tracheal intubation, endotracheal suction, disposal of excreta, chest physiotherapy, and feeding of highly dependent patients. Subsequently, 2 further groups of controls were also recruited: outpatient control (OPC) subjects consisting of 290 individuals randomly recruited from the general outpatient clinics at least 2 months after the SARS outbreak with no clinical history or signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection and household contact control (HHC) subjects consisting of 309 household members of patients with SARS who remained unaffected and confirmed to be seronegative at the end of the outbreak. All HHC subjects recruited were asked to state their relationship with the patient(s) with SARS as well as with other family members in the household. To prevent genotype and allele frequency distribution bias, family members of the same household who were genetically related were taken into consideration in the statistical analysis of genotypes. All control subjects were Chinese from Hong Kong.",

We specifically looked for nsSNPs that may result in structural changes of the encoded protein leading to functional effect, as well as 3\u2032UTR SNPs. At the time the study was initiated, no nsSNPs or 3\u2032UTR SNPs were reported for DC-SIGN. Allele frequency of the SNPs was first evaluated in 90 unaffected healthy individuals, and only those with minor allele frequency >5% were further investigated. Five SNPs for FCER2 and 1 for ICAM3 were thus selected for study. The nsSNP for L-SIGN with minor allele frequency <5% was not further investigated.",

For the analysis of numerical variables such as length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay, hematological and biochemical laboratory indices, each of these parameters was first analyzed by Student's t test to compare the mean values of patients having wild-type versus the variant genotype. Because of the variations in the reference ranges of biochemical indices used by different hospitals, some of the values, such as LDH, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase, were standardized by dividing the actual values by the upper limit of normal reference range. Parameters for which significant difference was obtained were further studied using the \u03c72 test. To identify the appropriate cutoff value to partition the values into 2 groups, values were arranged in ascending order forming a curve that fits a polynomial trend line. The cutoff value was taken at the inflection of the curve or at the point when the values begin to change exponentially.",

The 290 OPC subjects had previously been used in our genetic association study of L-SIGN for susceptibility to SARS [21]. However, only 260 cases had sufficient DNA left over for further analysis. The third control group of 309 HHC subjects was recontacted from the study of Leung et al. [2]. These consisted of asymptomatic close contact of patients with SARS that were serologically negative for SARS. Their relationship with the patients with SARS recruited is as summarized in table 3.",

Genotype data of both OPC and HHC groups were in HWE.

Although comparison of patients with SARS genotype with that of HCW control subjects suggested risk association for the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP, this association could not be confirmed on comparison with the other 2 control groups. The deviation from HWE in the HCW control group is intriguing as it was also observed for the L-SIGN (CLEC4M) tandem-neck repeats we had previously reported [21], for which genotype had been confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In that study, the association observed between SARS and HCW control subjects was confirmed by comparing patients with SARS with outpatient control and random control subjects, which both showed the same significant association. Because 22% of all patients with SARS in Hong Kong were health care workers [25], we therefore reckon that the unaffected health care workers recruited for study may likely represent a preselected group with overrepresentation of the protective L-SIGN genotype.",

Furthermore, \u03c72 test analysis comparing the ICAM3 genotypes of the 817 patients with SARS with these 170 HCW control subjects continued to demonstrate significant difference (P=.003). In contrast, the genotype and allele frequency distribution of the OPC and HHC groups were very similar to that of the patients with SARS. It is worth noting that the age and sex distribution of both OPC and HHC groups (table 1) are better matched to that of the patients with SARS recruited than that of the HCW control subjects. However, confounding factors such as age and sex had already been accounted for with the use of logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex (data not shown). The presence of other confounding factors as yet unaccounted for in this HCW population probably gave rise to this apparent association. Thus with the analysis of 3 control groups, no association of the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP with susceptibility to SARS infection can be concluded. On the other hand, genotype analysis of our 817 patients with SARS confirmed the association of higher LDH levels and lower WBC counts with the homozygous Gly143 genotype of ICAM3, which supports the role of ICAM3 in the immunopathogenesis of SARS.",

The ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP is located at the junction of domain 1 and 2 and the interchange of an acidic aspartic acid to a small neutral glycine at this junction is likely to affect the structuring of ICAM3 and subsequent dimer formation. Because DC-SIGN/ICAM3 receptor-ligand pair is crucial for antigen-presenting cells\u2014for example, for DCs to form immunological synapse with naive T cells\u2014the association of the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP with LDH levels and WBC counts found in our study suggest that the SNP may affect the interaction of T cells with DCs, thereby modulating T cell response in the immunopathogenesis of SARS. We therefore postulate that this conformational change may affect the binding capacity of the receptor, thus affecting lymphocyte activation and the initiation of immune response.

These findings are in keeping with the role of ICAM3 in T cell activation and the immune response. Association with susceptibility to SARS infection, on the other hand, would more likely to be found with binding receptors of the virus, such as L-SIGN as reported by our group [21]. The absence of significant association of ICAM3 Asp143Gly with other clinical parameters is likely related to the fact that the patients with SARS recruited for our study came from 6 different hospitals throughout Hong Kong. This may have introduced confounding factors that are difficult to eliminate, such as possible differences in management preferences relating to the length of hospital stay, ICU care, and decision to initiate assisted ventilation and administration of steroids. On the other hand, laboratory parameters were easier to standardize. Other parameters reported to correlate with clinical outcome such as viral load and chest X-ray appearances were only available for a relatively small number of patients.",

The finding of decreased peripheral T, B, and NK cells and high levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines in patients with SARS lend support to this [28, 29]. Increase in LDH levels in the acute phase of SARS infection has been postulated to be possibly related to immune hyperactivity [30]. High peak LDH levels have been reported to be an independent predictor of adverse outcome [31\u201334]. Thus patients with SARS who are homozygous for CC genotype of the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP are associated with a 4-fold chance of higher LDH levels on admission and poorer prognosis. Although the SARS outbreak appears to have been contained, the molecular determinants and pathogenesis of SARS remain unclear.
