Thanks to the moderate cost of repurposing a drug compared to bringing new chemical entity to the market, drug repurposing is rapidly gaining ground. The aim of this work is to study the anti-obesity effect of disulfiram (DSF), an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat chronic alcoholism since 1951. Methods: Thirty male Albino rats were randomly assigned to six groups. G1, the control group, was given a standard diet. G2, the positive control group, was given a high-fat diet (HFD). G3 was given an HFD, and DSF 50 mg/kg/day was administered orally from day one for six weeks. G4 was given an HFD, and DSF 200 mg/kg/day was administered orally from day one for six weeks. G5 was given an HFD for six weeks; then treatment started with 50 mg/kg/day DSF orally. G6 was given an HFD for six weeks; then treatment started with 200 mg/kg/day DSF orally for three weeks. The body weight, food consumption and blood glucose levels were monitored over the given time interval. Results: Both doses of DSF significantly limited the body weight gain caused by an HFD for the treated animals. HF-fed rats received 50 and 200 mg/kg/day of DSF had their body weight increased by 51.93 \u00b1 7.89% and 20.88 \u00b1 15.05% respectively, whereas the body weight of control animals increased by 93.1 \u00b1 20.04%. DSF also significantly decreased the body weight of obese animals. At 50 and 200 mg/kg/day of DSF, HF-fed rats lost 16.74 \u00b1 8.61% and 23.9 \u00b1 3.93% respectively, as their untreated counterparts had their body weight increased by 11.85 \u00b1 3.79% after three weeks of treatment, thus restoring a body weight matching those who received a standard diet. Conclusion: FDA-approved disulfiram has a strong anti-obesity effect on HFD-fed rats.",

            "text": "A drug repurposing strategy, also called repositioning, is an approach for identifying new therapeutic uses for approved or investigational drugs. 10 These new uses are usually outside the original medical indication. 11 Because of the high attrition rate, escalating costs and long timeframes for new drug discovery, drug repurposing is rapidly gaining ground. 10 The average cost of a successful drug repurposing is estimated to be US $300 million, about a tenth of that of bringing a new chemical entity to the market. 12 Since the repurposed drug successfully passed the safety assessment in preclinical studies and clinical trials, the risk of failure is significantly lower. 10 The redirection of sildenafil, which was originally developed as an antihypertensive agent to treat erectile dysfunction, is a great example of successful drug repurposing. The approval of thalidomide in 2006 to treat multiple myeloma is yet another example. 10 Drug repurposing could also be a useful approach during outbreaks of emerging diseases such as the recent attempts to use the FDA-approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor, lopinavir, 13 or the combination of the anti-malaria agent hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin to overcome the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 14 Disulfiram (DSF), Figure 1 , is an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor. Disulfiram blocks the alcohol metabolism at the acetaldehyde stage, leading to the accumulation of the latter in the blood. This in turn produces a highly unpleasant reaction, which includes low blood pressure, tachycardia, facial flushing, vomiting and vertigo when the patient treated with disulfiram ingests even small amounts of alcohol. 15 In 1951, disulfiram was the first drug to be approved by the FDA to treat chronic alcoholism. Many studies since then have shown the potential of repurposing disulfiram as an anticancer agent. 16 Currently, disulfiram is progressing through different stages of clinical trials to treat diverse types of malignant tumors, such as metastatic breast cancer, glioblastoma and recurrent pancreatic carcinoma. Disulfiram has also shown therapeutic potential as a latency-reversing agent in treating AIDS patients. 17, 18 More recently, disulfiram was shown to be beneficial in treating Lyme disease and babesiosis. 19 In addition to inhibiting Aldh2, the isoform responsible for alcohol metabolism, disulfiram even more potently inhibits Aldh1a1, 20 the cytosolic isoform that irreversibly converts retinaldehyde (Rald) into retinoic acid. 21, 22 The expression of Aldh1a1 is significantly higher in obese patients compared to lean subjects. 23 Furthermore, the disruption of expression or function of this enzyme in rats rendered them resistant to diet-induced obesity. 24 Moreover, Aldh1a1 deficient adipocytes were shown not only to effectively reduce body weight of mice fed a highfat diet (HFD), 25, 26 but also they markedly reduced waist circumference, body weight, and fat mass when implanted into visceral fat depots of obese large animal models such as dogs. 27 Additionally, Aldh1a1-deficient mice are viable and do not show any growth or survival defects. 28 Thus, inhibiting the function of Aldh1a1 is clearly an attractive approach to treating obesity. In this study, we showed that disulfiram can not only effectively reduce the body weight of obese rats but that it also prevents weight gain induced by an HFD in rats.",

When administered at a moderate dose of 50 mg/ kg/day to rats along with an HFD, DSF completely cancelled the obesogenic effect of the diet after six weeks of treatment. HFD-fed rats treated at higher doses of DSF, 200 mg/kg/day, showed a strong resistance to body weight increase. They gained less weight compared not only to their counterparts receiving HFD but also to those on a standard diet.",
