We designed a droplet generating device that would simulate a cough with an estimated velocity of 4\u201310 m/s. A tubing was then connected to the pressure generator and the tip of the nozzle was fixated at the midline in the oral cavity. One milliliter of fluorescent alcohol was then injected through the device as a simulated mass of secretion and droplets. Three different configurations of clear acrylic boxes were used and are illustrated in the Supplemental Digital Content, Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/AA/D105. The transparent plastic sheet used was 115 \u00d7100 cm.",

To systematically document the dispersion outside the boxes, each area was divided differently into columns and rows. A total of 300 measurement squares measuring 5 \u00d75 cm were created. The incidence of self-contamination was counted and recorded. Each technique was simulated and recorded for 5 consecutive times under fluorescent condition in a darkened research room.",

Moreover, using different models resulted in different protective outcomes as we proposed. This could be due to the individual design of each box (eg, the top [slope or flat]), the presence of a side-door opening and awning, and hand slots. The height of the box might take part in the contamination area as the droplet dispersion may rebound to the surroundings after striking the top. The slope top can also affect the contamination area. Uncontrollable dispersed flow against the slope top might cause the rebounding of secretion to the hand slots. The side door may cause more contamination if it is opened for airway management assistance. Therefore, we recommend to open the door as necessary for shortest time as possible. Also, if the box is completely wrapped with plastic sheet at both hand slots and around caudal-opening space, the risk of contamination should be diminished as it becomes a nearly closed system.",

Although we used only 1 mLof fluorescent fluid, the cough flow spread varied widely under the plastic sheet and toward the opposite side of the extubation attendant which was similar to how lava flows from volcanic eruptions (Figure, panels F).
