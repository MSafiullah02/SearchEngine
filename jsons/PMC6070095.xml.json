This historical cohort study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at MSKCC. Details regarding the study design were described elsewhere [3].

The study included 3 stages designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of CAR T cells (1 \u00d7 106/kg and 3 \u00d7 106/kg) and the addition of fludarabine to the conditioning chemotherapy regimen.

Notably, a similar finding of an association between CRS and infection was recently reported in another trial of CD19-targeted CAR T cells, but with a different costimulatory domain (41BB vs CD28 in our study) and in patients with ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [23]. However, a potential mechanism underlying the association between high-grade CRS and infection is unclear. Although high-grade CRS is correlated with robust CAR T-cell expansion [3\u20137] and preclinical studies have demonstrated that tonic CAR signaling may induce early exhaustion of T cells [24], there is currently no evidence to suggest that these T cells lead to immune dysfunction.",

This finding suggests that it is unlikely infection exacerbated CRS by altering cytokine levels, but further studies are required to investigate whether high levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immunosuppressive therapies contribute to the increased risk of infections in patients with severe CRS. Nonetheless, infections can occur together during times of CRS, and clinicians should be aware of infectious complications, because signs and symptoms of CRS and sepsis are often difficult to distinguish, with differences in management (eg, use of IL-6-directed therapies and corticosteroids in CRS) [26\u201328].",

The early occurrence of bacterial infections, followed by fungal infections, mirrors that in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT or high-risk patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy [29, 30]. Although no study patient received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis before CAR T-cell therapy, it is debatable whether fluoroquinolone prophylaxis would have had significant utility in this particular cohort. Once C. difficile infections were excluded, we found that 7 of the 13 remaining documented bacterial infections diagnosed within the first 30 days after CTI were due to resistant organisms. These included 3 VRE, 2 ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, 1 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, and 1 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. All study patients had previously experienced \u22652 lines of chemotherapy for B-ALL, and 19 patients (36%) had also undergone prior allogeneic HSCT. We can thus infer that these patients had significant antimicrobial exposure before CAR T-cell therapy. Although prior antimicrobial exposure is a well-known risk factor for colonization by resistant organisms, it is difficult to know to what degree it contributed in this study cohort [31].",

The majority of patients (32 of 42; 76%) received micafungin prophylaxis (100 mg intravenously daily). Compared with posaconazole suspension, micafungin was associated with a lower rate of premature discontinuation from gastrointestinal intolerance or adverse effects in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in a single-center, randomized, open-label study [32]. Although all 4 breakthrough IFIs occurred in patients receiving micafungin (4 of 32; 12.5%), this finding is comparable to the 8.6% rate of proven or probable IFI in the micafungin prophylactic arm [32]. It remains to be seen whether patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy can be better stratified to identify those at higher risk for invasive mold infections and better target antifungal prophylaxis.",
