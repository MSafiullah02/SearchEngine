A DNA gel electrophoresis to measure the size and the quantity of the amplicon is simple and inexpensive. However, it is not easy to discriminate among different amplicons having similar size by gel.

Finally, after another several rounds of amplification, the PCR reaction no longer generates templates as a result of the lack of critical components in the reaction.

Third, the template should not include complicated secondary structures because this would contribute to the fluorescence signal. After real-time PCR is finished, a melting curve is usually recorded. If PCR generates a homogeneous sequence, only one transition point should be observed. Otherwise, nonspecific products or contaminants may exist.

It is only after the probe hybridizes to the template and is digested by Taq DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase is known to have 5 0 -exonuclease activity), as it extends the amplification primers, that the linkage between dye and quencher is cleaved, subsequently restoring fluorescence of the dye molecule ( Fig. 3 .2). Similar to SG I, the fluorescence increases in proportion to the amount of PCR products, since more probes will hybridize and will be cleaved. The advantages of the TaqMan probe include (1) analysis in real time without the need for post-PCR handling, thus reducing labor and cost; (2) specific hybridization-based detection, which eliminates nonspecific signal; and (3) labeling with different dyes with monitoring of different sequence amplifications in one tube. At the same time, however, TaqMan probes have some challenges, including (1) limited use in different assays and (2) limited design parameters.

In the extension step, the polymerase will extend the sequence and displace the MB, returning it to the stem-loop conformation. In this case, the probe can be reused in the remaining cycles. MBs should be designed to hybridize 7-10 \u0131 C higher than primers, to ensure detection before primers are extended. Therefore, the stem should be just short enough to guarantee full hybridization, but not so short that can refold to the stem-loop structure after displacement of the molecular beacon by primer extension.

However, the Scorpion incorporates a primer into the sequence at the 3 0 end, next to the quencher, via a blocker [12] . This blocker is a non-amplified monomer, which prevents the PCR from reading through the probe. In the extension stage, the polymerase binds the primer and synthesizes the complementary strand of target sequence just as it works in regular PCR. During the annealing step in next cycle, the loop will hybridize to the complementary strand within the same DNA. This separates the fluorophore and quencher, and an enhanced fluorescent signal is instantaneously observed (Fig. 3.4) . Because the probe and primer are in the same molecule, the reaction kinetics is extremely fast. Also, intramolecular interaction is more favorable than intermolecular hybridization. This enables the Scorpion probe to provide a higher signal than other bimolecular systems, including either TaqMan or MB, but the design of the Scorpion is more difficult. Specifically, it reduces flexibility in probe design where the loop should be engineered such that it is not too far from the complementary part to ensure high hybridization efficiency.

The appearance of green, red, and both signals represented the homozygous wild type, homozygous mutant, and heterozygote, respectively. Later in 1998, in another report [16] , they proved that MB-based sequence analysis could be adopted as an accurate assessment of DNA sequence. Five MBs, each complementary to a short fragment, were combined with 1-3 bases overlapped to span an 81 bp core region on the rpoB gene. This assay is simple and rapid. Most importantly, no contamination was observed since the tubes were not opened throughout the entire assay. Seventy-five clinical DNA isolates were correctly identified as drug susceptible or drug resistant. A broad range of point mutations, insertions, and deletions were detected successfully. Furthermore, in their paper in 1999 [17] , up to four MBs, each with a different color, were used to explore four variants which differed from one another only by one base position. In four tubes, all the MBs were added with only one target variant. After PCR, only one fluorescence response was observed in each tube.

Another limitation comes from the instrument. Traditional thermal cyclers often have fixed excitation/emission filters. Under this condition, two dyes, which can be separate on a fluorometer, might not be able to be distinguished in PCR assays due to the lack of appropriate filters. Tyagi et al. proposed the construction of wavelengthshift MB [18] , which emitted different fluorescent colors, but was excited with monochromatic light. This was realized by attaching a second fluorophore next to the fluorophore of a normal MB, which still contains a nonfluorescent quencher. In this design, one dye served as a harvester with strong absorption in the range of the light source. The other dye accepted the emission transferred from the harvester and emitted the desired color of fluorescence. This shift in emission spectrum is due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the harvester fluorophore to the emitter fluorophore.
