What is evident from the unfolding of events is that either the WHO\u2019s guidance on travel was wrong and had a serious negative impact on the spread of disease, or states\u2019 actions to prevent the spread of disease through travel restrictions have unnecessarily had a serious negative impact on the global economy. We expect the answer is somewhere in between, but it appears that the IHR (2005) framework to prevent unnecessary interference with international travel and trade is not succeeding as intended.",

Scientifically, the best opportunity to prevent the spread of disease is at the beginning of the epidemic curve. Taking a precautionary approach, the evidentiary threshold to act thus must be low, even recognising the negative economic consequences. One limitation of the IHR (2005) is that Temporary Recommendations are issued only once a PHEIC is declared, at which point it may already be too late for measures to be most effective. By the time WHO acknowledged, in late February, that restrictions on travel might have some limited value,8 the window of opportunity to prevent a pandemic had long been closed.",

Excluding people based on the passport they carry also carries a greater risk of contributing to stigma and discrimination, and the IHR (2005) and other laws require states to respect human rights and avoid discrimination. Any type of restriction that targets specific countries becomes increasingly difficult to justify once other countries begin reporting similar or larger numbers of cases. Most, but not all, states replaced these targeted measures with broad-based restrictions as the pandemic spread. Other actions, such as blocking access to ports, must also be scrutinised closely. In this case and others, whether a ban on access or entry can be justified as the least restrictive measure available may depend on local capacity and other factors. Official statements and other sources may also give some indication as to whether states are complying with their obligations to take relevant factors (eg, scientific evidence and WHO advice) into account when making decisions about restricting international traffic.",

The WHO would need to be able to bring in travel recommendations well before the declaration of a PHEIC, a point at which the best chance of preventing spread of the disease would have passed.

In this case, this could eventually involve establishing some standard for immunity, be it serological or immunisation, analogous to the Yellow Fever International Certificate of Vaccination, which is recognised under the IHR (2005) as one that member states can require as a condition of entry.1 If this type of certificate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunity becomes a feasible option, the WHO would be best placed to create this standard and incorporate it into the IHR (2005).",

Some states appear not to have complied with their obligations to report additional measures, to base measures on scientific principles and evidence and to use the least restrictive measures available. For some measures, however, it is less clear that they violate IHR (2005) obligations even if they were not recommended by the WHO, particularly if restrictions on international traffic are implemented as part of a larger strategy to limit movement and contact. The WHO\u2019s ability to recommend restrictions at an early stage, when they would have been most useful, was likely hampered by a number of factors, including a lack of flexibility in the IHR (2005) framework. Now faced with the reality of widespread border closures, the WHO still has a useful role to play in informing and supporting the difficult decisions that states need to make in the months ahead. Going forward, changes are needed to make the IHR (2005) a more effective framework, including empowering the WHO to take early action, a fund to support affected states and WHO-coordinated strategies to reopen borders.",
