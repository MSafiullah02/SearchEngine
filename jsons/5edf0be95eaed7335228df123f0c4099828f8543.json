            "text": "The phenomenon that SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS M pro ) dimer is the main functional form has been confirmed by experiment. However, because of the absence of structural information of the monomer, the reasons for this remain unknown. To investigate it, two molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water for dimer and monomer models have been carried out, using the crystal structure of protomer A of the dimer as the starting structure for the monomer. During the MD simulation of dimer, three interest phenomena of protomer A have been observed: (i) the distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 averages 3.72 \u00c5 , which agrees well with the experimental observations made by X-ray crystallography; (ii) His163 and Glu166 form the ''tooth'' conformational properties, resulting in the specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site; and (iii) the substrate-binding pocket formed by loop 140-146 and loop 184-197 is large enough to accommodate the substrate analog. However, during the MD simulation of the monomer complex, the three structural characteristics are all absent, which results directly in the inactivation of the monomer. Throughout the MD simulation of the dimer, the N-terminus of protomer B forms stable hydrogen bonds with Phe140 and Glu166, through which His163, Glu166, and loop 140-146 are kept active form. Furthermore, a water-bridge has been found between the N-terminus of protomer B and Gly170, which stabilizes His172 and avoids it moving toward Tyr161 to disrupt the H-bond between Tyr161 and His163, stabilizing the conformation of His163. The interactions between the N-terminus and another monomer maintain the activity of dimer. Proteins 2007;66:467-479. V V C 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a previously unrecognized coronavirus, was discovered by the etiological agent of the disease, [1] [2] [3] [4] which encodes all the sequences of functional proteins required for viral replication and transcription. It is also known that the functional polypeptides are released from polyprotein by extensive proteolytic processing, primarily by the SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS M pro ). This protease, with a chymotrypsin fold, has similarity with the coronavirus main protease in sharing the cleavage specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site. 5, 6 For the functional importance of SARS M pro in the viral life cycle, it becomes an attractive target in drug development directly against SARS disease. 7-12 However, presently, neither a vaccine nor an efficacious therapy is available. So, it is still urgent to design the potential therapeutic agents against SARS.",

Both HCoV (Human Coronavirus) and TGEV (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus) M pro exist as a mixture of monomer and dimer in diluted solutions. 14 Dissection of the enzyme results in the enzyme inactive and the dimer is the main function form of the enzyme. 15, 16 However, the reason for this remains unknown. The structural infor-mation about the monomer and dimer, especially for the residues of the active pocket, could provide some insights into the functional differences. The crystal structure of SARS M pro dimer has been solved, 17 while, for the monomer form, only a theoretical model of its 3D structure, based on the structures of the HCoV and TGEV M pro , has been described. 18 The main difference between the monomer and the dimer is that there exist some specific intermolecular interactions between the two monomers within the dimer, while not for the isolated monomer. There exist a number of intermolecular interactions between the two monomers within the dimer, that is, the hydrogen bonds between active pocket and the N-terminus of another monomer, the salt bridge between domain III and N-terminus of another monomer and the specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the domains III of monomers in dimer. Since any mutation or deletion of these residues involving the interactions have resulted in an inactive enzyme, 14, 19 these interactions are vital to maintain the active conformation of SARS M pro dimer and might be the ultimate reasons for the activity differences between dimer and monomer, which can be treated as new targets for the drug design against SARS-CoV. However, because of the absence of conformational information about monomer, the key functional roles of these intermolecular interactions in how to fix the dimer at active structure are still vague.",

So, MD simulation can be used as a powerful tool for studying the structural variations and motions of SARS M pro . Many MD studies on the enzyme have been reported [20] [21] [22] that none of them target the differences of the structure and dynamics of the active site residues of monomer relative to dimer. Using the X-ray structure of the enzyme dimer form and the protomer A deleting protomer B within the dimer as the starting point of dimer and monomer model, we have performed two MD simulations of dimer and monomer. Because of the absence of the crystal structure of enzyme complexed with substrate for substrate hydrolysis by SARS M pro , the substrate-analog hexapetidyl CMK inhibitor, which cannot be hydrolyzed by enzyme, was present in the structures of both MD simulations to investigate the substrate binding.",

It is obvious from the plot in Figure 3 that the B-factors from the dimer MD simulation are little higher than the crystallographic B-factors except for segment 120:170, where the calculated fluctuations are close to the experimental ones. The 120:170 segment corresponds to the domain II of SARS M pro (the interfacial region of SARS M pro dimer), which is buried in the dimer interior thus not exposed to the solvent. This may explain a better agreement of the calculated mobility with the crystal.

In contrast to the angle of $908 in crystal structure, the imidazole ring of His41 turns toward Asp187. This turn helps to form a stable hydrogen bond between His41 and Asp187 [ Fig. 4(c) ]. So, it can be seen from the MD simulation that, in solution, when the active pocket of SARS M pro combines with substrate, to bind substrate tightly and hydrolyze it efficiently, His41 might regulate itself to turn toward Asp187 and squeeze the water molecule out, thus converting the catalytic site from the dyad (His41 and Cys145) to a more efficient catalytic triad (His41, Cys145, and Asp187). Although it still has not been confirmed by experiment, it can be hypothesized that the catalytic efficiency of the SARS M pro is regulated by substrate binding, which is in accordance with the results found in the MD simulations of SARS M pro modeled by homology complexed with its designed substrate 22 and is helpful in inhibitor design for SARS M pro .",

The dimer conformers are highly characterized that His163 and Glu166 form the ''tooth'' protruding into the ''mouth'' shaped void, the residues of S1 pocket of protomer A within the dimer. Throughout the entire MD simulation of dimer complex, the ''mouth'' is closed all the time, with the ''tooth'' fastening the glutamine residue. The properties of His163 in the MD simulation of the SARS M pro dimer complex are consistent with the fact that the interactions between histidine and gluta-mine determine the coronavirus M pro specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site. 14 However, during the entire MD simulation of the SARS M pro monomer, the dihedral angle CA-CB-CG-CD2 of His163 is almost constantly around value 1508, compared with the dimer this amounts to a change of $308 [ Fig. 8(b) ]. The imidazole ring of His163 rotates away from the carboxamide side chain of glutamine at P1 [ Fig. 7(b) ]. In this turned orientation, the distance between the imidazole moiety NE2 of His163 and OE1 of glutamine at P1 averages 7.90 \u00c5 (see Fig. 6 ), resulting in the disruption of the hydrogen bond.

Either of these two interactions is destroyed, the conformation of the imidazole ring of His163 will be caused unstable, which will decrease the enzyme activity or make it inactive. A good evidence for this is that the mutation of Tyr161 makes the enzyme almost inactive. 31 In the monomer, because of the absence of the interactions with the N-terminus of protomer B, the conformation of Phe140 is instable. As shown in Figure 14 , the phenyl ring of Phe140 has a $408 increment in the average dihedral angle CD1-CG-CB-CA of Phe140. In this turned orientation [ Fig. 7(b) ], the phenyl ring of Phe140 rotates away from the imidazole ring of His163 and cannot stack onto the imidazole ring of His163. Furthermore, without the interaction of the N-terminus through the water-bridge, b-strand 163-172 becomes partly disordered and moves towards Tyr161. The main chain O atom of His172 competes with ND1 atom of His163 by forming stable hydrogen bond with the OH atom of Tyr161 (Table II) , resulting in the disruption of the OH(Tyr161). . .ND1(His163) hydrogen bond (Fig. 15 , Table II ). In the monomer, since the two interactions that maintain the stable conformation of the imidazole ring of His163 are destroyed, the conformation of the imidazole ring of His163 is not stable, making the turn mentioned above.",

In the dimer, there exist two type of intermolecular interactions between the two monomers to fix the domain III: (i) the salt-bridge between Arg4 at the N-terminus of protomer B and Glu290 at domain III in protomer A 19 , which in this MD simulation of the SARS M pro dimer, possesses the occupancy of 100% and average distance of 2.71 \u00c5 (Table I) and (ii) the specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the domains III of the monomers. 13 By these intermolecular interactions, the domain III is fixed in a proper conformation required for stabilization of loop 184-197, which makes the S3 pocket in this loop keep the proper conformation to accommodate threonine at the substrate analog P3 site. In the monomer, because of the absence of these intermolecular interactions, the whole 184-197 loop moves toward the active site, resulting in the collapse of the S3 pocket. A good evidence for this is that any mutant of Glu290 abolishes completely the activity of the SARS main protease. 19 From the analysis, a reasonable conclusion can be got that the intermolecular interactions between the two monomers in the dimer, especially for the interactions around N-terminus and domain III of one monomer, are key to stabilizing the residues of the active pocket of the other monomer in the active form, therefore insuring the successful proceeding of the combination and hydrolysis of the substrate in the dimer. This is well verified by the experiments that a deletion mutant of D1-5 residues or domain III of the related TGEV M pro are almost completely inactive. 14 Thus, in SARS M pro dimer, the enzyme is switched from the inactive form (monomer) to the active form (dimer) by the intermolecular interactions between the two monomers within the dimer.

This prevents His170 competing with His163 and forming H-bond with Tyr161 and maintains the stable hydrogen bond between Tyr161 and His163. Furthermore, the N-terminus of the counter monomer interacts directly with Phe140, making the conformation of the phenyl ring of Phe140 stable and stack onto the imidazole ring of His163. Just for these two interactions, the imidazole ring of His163 can maintain the conformation required for donating the proton to bind glutamine at the substrate analog P1 site. The N-terminus of the counter monomer also forms a stable hydrogen bond with Glu166, which stabilizes the proper conformation of the side chain carbonate group of Glu166 required for accepting a hydrogen bond from glutamine at the substrate analog P1 site. His163 and Glu166 form the ''tooth'' conformation characteristics and result in the specificity for glutamine at the substrate P1 site. While in the monomer, because of the lack of the stabilization of the N-terminus of the counter monomer to His163 and Gly166, the ''tooth'' conformation is destroyed, resulting in a destruction of the specific recognition of the glutamine of the substrate at the P1 site and the inactivation of monomer. Furthermore, it is the lack of the stabilization of the N-terminus of the counter monomer to Phe140 that makes the loop 140-146 move a lot toward the active site, which causes the collapse of the ''oxyanion hole'' and leaves no space to accommodate glutamine at the substrate analog P1 site and a tetrahedral intermediate. Because of the loss of the salt-bridge between the N-terminus of counter monomer and domain III and the specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between domain III of monomers within the dimer, the conformation of domain III cannot be fixed. As a consequence, the loop 184-197 becomes disorder and the S3 pocket collapses, leaving no space to accommodate the threonine at the substrate analog P3 site. The movements of loop 140-146 and loop 184-197 toward the active site induce the reduction of substrate-binding pocket. As a consequence, the SARS M pro monomer cannot bind the substrate. In the dimer, the distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 averages 3.72 \u00c5 , which agrees well with the experimental observations made by X-ray crystallography. While in the monomer, the longer distance between the two entities deviates a lot from the crystal structure and might be unfavorable to substrate hydrolysis by the monomer by a general-base mechanism.",
