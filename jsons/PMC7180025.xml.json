How safe is peanut OIT and how much protection over peanut avoidance does it provide? How frequently should we evaluate desensitization to peanut doses exceeding the maintenance dose? What effects on quality of life does OIT have? Going forward, emerging allergen-specific strategies (eg, modified peanut vaccines) and biologic drugs beg the question of standardization of clinical trial reporting of outcomes and safety parameters. These are only some of the questions that need to be answered to fully comprehend the risk-to-benefit ratio of novel therapies for food allergy.",

Capucilli et al2 performed a comprehensive PubMed literature search of reviews and clinical articles discussing peanut or other food-related allergic reactions, accidental exposures, or anaphylaxis pertinent to avoidance diet or comparative with OIT trials. They found that peanut remains a leading allergen associated with accidental ingestions responsible for food-related reactions, both mild and severe. However, interventions such as emergency treatment plans can significantly decrease the risk of accidental anaphylaxis. In addition, patients may overestimate anaphylaxis risk from inhalation or through skin contact. They concluded that considering the increased risk of anaphylaxis during the first year of OIT, peanut avoidance remains a viable option for long-term peanut allergy management and should be discussed with all patients with food allergy seeking novel therapies.",

They proposed that food-induced anaphylaxis has pathophysiology that differs from anaphylaxis induced by other triggers and also that within food-induced anaphylaxis, there might be different endotypes. They observed that many patients with food allergy experience a typical pattern of symptoms after food allergen exposure, both during supervised oral food challenges as well as at large. They proposed integrating datasets from different cohorts and applying unbiased machine learning analyses as an effective tool to characterize specific food allergy endotypes in a similar way to asthma. They postulate this as an important area for future research to gain better accuracy in predicting patients at the highest risk of severe food-induced anaphylaxis.",

In this registry, 67% were male patients with an average age of 18 years (range, 2-44 years).

With shorter needles, the injection may be delivered into the subcutaneous tissue instead of the muscle tissue, thus resulting in slower systemic absorption and longer time to achieve serum peak concentration. With longer needle lengths, there is a risk of intraosseous or periosteal injection. They concluded that future research should consider not only the length but also the variation in pressure needed to release the needles in a way that ensures reliable and safe intramuscular delivery.",
