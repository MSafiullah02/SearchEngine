This is a reason for concern, as the COVID-216 19 pandemia is spreading around the world and most likely many pregnant women will be 217 affected. 17 However, one may question whether the choices made by the obstetricians thus far were 218 modified. In most cases, the indication for the operation was not clearly stated, and it is certainly 219 possible that the decision was influenced by the understandable anxiety towards the potential 220 consequences of a new viral infection. 18-20 Indeed, in our analysis of the available literature, the 221 outcome has been generally favorable for both mothers and fetuses, although a word of caution is 222 necessary. Of 51 cases we have analyzed, at least one mother was severely compromised, and in 223 general follow-up data were scanty. We confirm that there is no evidence of vertical transmission, 224 but previous experience with infections, caused by similar pathogens, such as SARS and 225 MERS, 21, 22 indicates that vertical transmission is not the exclusive cause of fetal morbidity and 226 mortality. Out of 48 fetuses that were delivered, there was one stillbirth in a severely compromised 227 mother, and there was also one neonatal death that may not be independent from the infection. At 228 present, the available evidence does not provide insight as to these patients require or not a different 229 approach from a standard one. It would be important that in the near future studies around the 230 implications of COVID-19 in pregnancy contain thorough information about both the maternal and 231 fetal conditions at the time of delivery, as well as the rational behind obstetric interventions. 232 233 234", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1100, "end": 1103, "text": "21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1106, "text": "22", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principal finding 214"}, {"text": "The main strength of our analysis is that we have provided thus far the largest series on pregnancies 236 with COVID-19 illness. The main weakness is that the available literature around the obstetric 237 implications of COVD-19 is limited, both in numbers and quality. The justification behind our 238 study is that the spread of the disease dictates the need to rapidly evaluate and discuss the evidence 239 that has been generated. favorable results that were observed seems unlikely, but cannot be excluded with certainty. In non-249 pregnant patients COVID-19 illness spans along a wide spectrum of severity. The majority of 250 patients, particularly those of young age, are asymptomatic or anyhow have no respiratory 251 compromise. In these cases, standard obstetric care seems sufficient, with the only caveat, that fetal 252 distress was described in almost 20% of cases. Whether this was related to maternal compromise or 253 not is not known, but it seems reasonable to provide continuous fetal monitoring in labor. In a 254 minority of patients (1 case in our series of 51) severe compromise will be present. In such a cases, 255 after fetal viability, cesarean delivery may be life -saving for both the mother and neonate. The 256 most difficult scenario is certainly the intermediate case, a patient with compensated respiratory 257 insufficiency, that may deteriorate in the following days. In preterm pregnancies, balancing the pros 258 and cons of a conservative management versus expediting the delivery is difficult, as well as 259 deciding the optimal mode to deliver a mother on the presence of hypoxia. The issue of obstetric 260 complications is also relevant. The high rate of premature delivery in our review appears to be 261 mostly the consequence of elective interventions. However, COVID-19 illness seems to be 262 associated with spontaneous preterm birth as well, as in our review preterm labour was reported in 263 at least 6/48 cases and premature rupture of the membranes in 9/34. 264", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strength and limitations 235"}, {"text": "The available data on COVID-19 illness in pregnant patients do not provide a clear conclusion into 266 the clinical implications for mother and fetus.

Was there a challenge/rechallenge phenomenon? 6. Was there a dose-response effect? 7. Was follow-up long enough for outomes to occur? Reporting 8.
