Just like N36 and C34, both NHR and CHR in syncytin displayed putative coiled-coil structure (Fig. 6\n). The potential complex between NHR and CHR was then investigated by using the protein-docking software ZDOCK 2.3. The complex structure built by the docking technique demonstrated that NHR and CHR associated in an antiparallel manner (Fig. 6). Several hydrophobic interactions occurred between NHR and CHR, e.g., L386 and L375 of NHR interacted with I413 and I421 of CHR, respectively. There might be also several hydrogen bonds existing in the NHR\u2013CHR complex, e.g., T367 and R383 of NHR were hydrogen bonded to R433 and Q410 of CHR, respectively. This model fitted well with an antiparallel dimer of NHR + CHR complex in syncytin, just like those in HIV-1 gp160 and coronavirus spike protein [8], [9], [27], [28], and provided us putative detailed interactions between NHR and CHR in syncytin.",
