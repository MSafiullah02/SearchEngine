Next, we collected demographic and economic data for each community from the censusreporter.org website [14] . This information was sourced from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey [15] . The following metrics were considered: proportions of White, Black, Hispanic and Asian residents, median age, per capita income, median household income, proportion of persons below poverty level, mean travel time to work. We restricted our analyses to the 128 communities with populations greater than 1,000 persons. We utilized standard statistical and plotting functions in Matlab; confidence intervals for all estimates were calculated by bootstrapping with 10,000 samples.

Figure 3B shows that the minority population proportion has the highest absolute correlation with the attack rate. The attack rates are cor-related with Black and Hispanic population proportions equally strongly. The Asian population proportion and travel time to work do not correlate significantly with the attack rate, though this may be owing to the narrow range of these variables in the communities under study.

We notice that the New York State and Suffolk County governments have begun taking first steps to address this crisis. The new Covid-19 testing sites have been opened on April 8-16 in minority communities that are Covid-19 hot spots: Brentwood (3-fold higher attack rate than Suffolk County average), Huntington Station (2.4-fold), Wyandanch (2.8-fold).
