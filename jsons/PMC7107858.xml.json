The authors report a significant increase in the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition rate, with a very high rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia\u2014caused mainly by MRSA\u2014in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in an intensive care unit (ICU) that admitted only patients with SARS. Paradoxically, this increase occurred after infection-control measures (including the wearing of gloves and gowns at all times) were upgraded because of the SARS outbreak and despite a low importation rate of MRSA into the ICU.",

First, the practice of wearing gloves at all times may have led to poor compliance with hand hygiene, and the routine wearing of long-sleeved gowns, which were not changed between contact with patients, could also have contributed to cross-transmission of MRSA. Second, the heavy use of antimicrobials active against gram-negative organisms could have promoted the overgrowth of MRSA. Third, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may predispose patients to secondary infection with S. aureus.",

An alternative explanation for the significant increase in the rate of MRSA acquisition may be a viral-bacterial interaction between SARS-CoV and S. aureus, leading to an explosive airborne dispersal of S. aureus and a very efficient transmission of MRSA from colonized to noncolonized patients (the \u201ccloud phenomenon\u201d). This phenomenon was described by Eichenwald et al. [2], who showed that newborn infants who are nasally colonized with S. aureus produce significant airborne S. aureus dispersal and become highly contagious after infection with a respiratory virus. These babies caused explosive outbreaks of S. aureus infection in nurseries. Because they were literally surrounded by clouds of bacteria, they were called \u201ccloud babies\u201d [2]. We have recently shown that the same mechanism also occurs in certain adult nasal S. aureus carriers (\u201ccloud adults\u201d) [3\u20135]. Reports in the literature describe single health care workers nasally colonized with S. aureus who originated nosocomial S. aureus epidemics while experiencing a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. This confirms that \u201ccloud adults\u201d can cause outbreaks [3, 6, 7]. Our data also indicate that clothing contaminated with S. aureus can amplify the dispersal of these bacteria into the air [4, 5], in agreement with previous observations [8, 9].",
