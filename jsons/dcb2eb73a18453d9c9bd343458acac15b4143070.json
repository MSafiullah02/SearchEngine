As a whole, chiropterans now represent the largest known reservoir of emerging viruses (Calisher et al. 2006; Wong et al. 2007) . Amongst the 60 viral species currently associated with bats, 59 are RNA viruses of importance in the current generation of emerging and re-emerging human infections (Wong et al. 2007 ). Lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses are amongst those pathogens impacting the health and well-being of both people and non-human animals around the globe. In comparison to the studies conducted on viral infections, much less attention has been paid to the non-viral pathogens of zoonotic importance within bat populations (Frick et al. 2010; Reichard et al. 2009 ). This is changing, however, as more research is now being conducted to detect and describe bacteria 697",

Of 199 human cases transmitted by bats during the period 1996-2006, 146 (73 %) were transmitted by vampire bats, 16 (8 %) by nonvampire bats, and 37 (19 %) with no species reported (Schneider et al. 2009 ). For instance, in Peru, during 2002 of the rabies cases diagnosed were associated with vampire bats, whereas 87 (23 %) were related to dog rabies virus variants (Condori-Condori et al. 2013) . It was also shown that vampire bat rabies variants spread gradually and involve different vampire bat subpopulations with different transmission cycles. Bovine paralysis caused by rabid vampire bat bites also has a major economical impact on cattle production in Mexico and several South American countries (Streicker et al. 2012) .

Initial signs include headache, slight fever, malaise and pain at the bite wound. The disease which lasts from 2 to 6 days without medical support, progresses to paralysis of the muscles of deglutition, hyperesthesia and generalized convulsions. Death ensues shortly thereafter (Hoar et al. 1998 ). In bats, infection rate and mortality is usually low, although this has been studied in few species. Experimental studies in vampire bats indicate that a high viral load is necessary to induce mortality, with either no observable clinical signs or squeaking, tremor, paralysis and loss of appetite (Aguilar-S\u00e9tien et al. 2005) . In cattle infected by vampire bats, rabies is mainly expressed by paralysis with a rather long incubation period (25-150 days or more) and lasts for 2-5 days before causing death (Hoar et al. 1998 ).",

As of December 2012, a total of forty-five outbreaks of Hendra virus have occurred in north-eastern Australia, all involving infection of horses (Aljofan 2013) . As a result of these events, 90 animals (88 horses and two dogs) have died or been euthanized. These cases have all occurred in Queensland and in north-east New South Wales. Case fatality rate in humans is 60 % (4 of 7 recorded cases) and in horses 75 %. Human infections with Hendra virus range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. Infected people initially develop fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), sore throat and a dry cough. They could also have enlarged lymph nodes, lethargy and vertigo. The incubation period ranges from five to 14 days. Hendra virus is transmitted to people through close contact with infected horses or their body fluids. To date, no human-to-human transmission of Hendra virus has been documented. No specific treatment is available, but a vaccine has been developed for immunization of horses and is available since the end of 2012. The following signs have all been associated with Hendra virus cases in horses, but not all these signs will be found in any one infected horse: rapid onset of illness, increased body temperature/fever and heart rate, discomfort/weight shifting between legs, depression and rapid deterioration with either respiratory and/or nervous signs. Respiratory signs include respiratory distress, increased respiratory rates, nasal discharge at death that can be initially clear until progressing to stable white froth and/or stable blood-stained froth. Nervous signs include wobbly gait, apparent loss of vision in one or both eyes, aimless walking in a dazed state, head tilting and circling, muscle twitching, urinary incontinence and inability to rise. Horses get infected when very high concentrations of virus material are deposited directly under trees in what is call the 'drip zone' and almost no virus is deposited once the horses leave the perimeter of the trees. This area of the trees where the spats and the urine of feeding flying foxes will be dropped potentially poses an extremely high risk for horses (Australian Veterinary Association: http://www.ava. com.au/hendra-virus).",

A second outbreak in India, close to the Bangladesh border, was reported in 2007.

Since the emergence of NiV in Bangladesh and India, over 200 human cases have been identified, with an overall case fatality exceeding 70 %. Most cases are related to consumption of unwashed fruits or palm juice contaminated by fruit bats secretions (saliva, urine, fecal materials).

Of the infected animals identified during these field collections, immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific for Ebola virus was detected in serum from three different bat species (4/17 Hypsignathus monstrosus, 8/117 Epomops franqueti and 4/58 Myonycteris torquata). Viral nucleotide sequences were detected in livers and spleens in other bats from the same populations (4/21, 5/117 and 4/141, respectively). No viral RNA was detected in kidney, heart or lung in these animals after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and no viral nucleotide sequences were revealed in any of the other animal species tested.",

During the latter outbreak several epidemiological investigations were conducted to identify the underlying ecological conditions and animal sources. Qualitative social and environmental data were collected through interviews with villagers and by direct observation ). The local populations reported no unusual morbidity or mortality among wild or domestic animals, but they described a massive annual fruit bat migration toward the southeast, up the Lulua River. Migrating bats settled in the outbreak area for several weeks, between April and May, nestling in the numerous fruit trees in Ndongo and Koumelele islands as well as in palm trees of a largely abandoned plantation.

Subsequently, two groups independently identified SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in species of bats in China. Li et al. (2005) reported serological and molecular evidence of a cluster of SARS-like coronaviruses in several species of free-living horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) in southern China. They contend that the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak in humans in 2003 emerged from this cluster of viruses, and that bats are the origin of the SARS coronavirus. Rhinolophus species are more likely to foster host shifts of coronaviruses than other bat species; this propensity, when combined with the potential for close contact between bats, civets and humans in the wildlife trade in southern China, supports SARS-like coronaviruses as being the source of the SARS coronavirus (Field 2009 ). The majority of the coronaviruses originated from African, Asian and European bats (Corman et al. 2013 ). In addition to SARS-CoV, four human coronaviruses (HCoVs), termed HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 are known.",

Phylogenetic analyses of Bartonella strains derived from bats identified several distinct phylogroups indicating the presence of a variety of novel Bartonella species in bats. It is notable that bats of the same species as well as bats of the same geographic origin and ecological niche (i.e. Desmodus rotundus, members of the family Vespertilionidae) shared closely related strains of Bartonella. It is not known if these Bartonella species are zoonotic. Furthermore, soft ticks (family Argasidae) and other ectoparasites commonly found on bats or in bat habitats are infected with Bartonella, Borrelia and Rickettsia species, posing a potential risk of intra-and interspecies transmission cycles between bats, humans and domestic animals (M\u00fchldorfer 2013 ).",

The prevalence of leptospiral infections in bats varied from almost 2-35 % depending on the sample size of the respective study. The family Phyllostomidae comprised the majority of microbats infected with Leptospira, whereas in obligate insectivorous species (i.e. families Vespertilionidae and Molossidae) leptospiral infection with pathogenic strains has occasionally been found. In Australia, native flying fox populations (genus Pteropus) were suggested as possible carriers of pathogenic Leptospira responsible for infections in humans and other animals because of high bacterial detection rates in kidney (11 %) and urine samples (39 %) and high seroprevalences (18, 28 %) (M\u00fchldorfer 2013) . Similarly, bats from Madagascar and Comoros islands harbor a notable diversity of Leptospira spp.; a finding similar to the diversity found in a comparable investigation of bats in the Amazon region (Lagadec et al. 2012; Matthias et al. 2005) . Leptospirosis incubation is 1-32 days (median 9 days) and median duration is 14 days. Most symptomatic patients develop a mild illness consisting of fever, chills, headache and myalgia. Severe forms of the disease may manifest in acute renal failure, hepatitis, jaundice, myocarditis and meningoencephalitis and outbreaks of severe pulmonary hemorrhagic leptospirosis have occurred resulting in high morbidity and mortality (Leshem et al. 2011) .",

Many species of trypanosomes can infect bats, but one of main concern is Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease. Recently a new genotype of T. cruzi, associated with bats from anthropic areas and which could be a potential source of infection to humans was described (Marcili et al. 2009 ). Chagas disease is commonly transmitted by reduviid bed bugs. In humans, the disease is characterized by high fever, adenitis, anemia and facial edema in the acute form and myocarditis in the chronic form. Pathogenicity of bat trypanosomes for humans is not clearly established. T. cruzi has been detected in vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, which can be of concern in term of zoonotic transmission, as these bats feed on mammals, including humans (Ramirez et al. 2013) . Infection of bats with Toxoplasma gondii has been reported based on serological studies and more recently on its isolation from bats in Brazil (Cabral et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2013) . Therefore, consumption of undercooked bats could be a source of human infection. In bats, systemic toxoplasmosis caused by T. gondii was diagnosed in two juvenile, captive flying-foxes ( Pteropus conspicillatus and P. scapulatus), which died following respiratory distress. One animal displayed clinical signs suggestive of neurological disease (Sangster et al. 2012) .",

There are two varieties that are pathogenic to humans, var. duboisii and var. capsulatum. The former exists only in Africa, while var. capsulatum is most prevalent in regions of North, Central, and South America, but has also been reported from parts of Africa, Southern and Eastern Europe, Eastern Asia, and Australia (Cottle et al. 2013) . It grows as a mold in soil enriched with bird or bat guano; human infection occurs after inhalation of the dust generated when such soil is disturbed. Visiting caves, collecting or being exposed to bat guano are the main sources of human contamination from bats (CDC 2012; Cottle et al. 2013; Hoar et al. 1998; J\u00fclg et al. 2008; Kajfasz and Basiak 2012; Schwarz and Kauffman 1977) . The threat of Histoplasma capsulatum infection in bat-inhabited caves should be emphasized to travelers and also to physicians (Kajfasz and Basiak 2012) . Bats usually are healthy carriers and shed the fungus in their feces. In humans, clinical manifestations in humans vary according to host immunity and exposure intensity, ranging from asymptomatic infection (in most healthy persons exposed to a low inoculum; about 80 % of the time) to life-threatening pneumonia with respiratory failure (Cottle et al. 2013; Hoar et al 1998) . Between these extremes, clinical presentations include acute or subacute pulmonary disease, pericarditis, rheumatological syndromes with erythema nodosum, progressive disseminated disease, and mediastinal complications. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in returning travelers typically presents as a flu-like illness with high-grade fever, chills, headache, nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue. Chest radiographs often show diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Symptom onset is usually 1-3 weeks following exposure and most individuals recover spontaneously within 3 weeks. Disseminated disease is a rare complication, more likely to occur in persons with severely impaired cellular immunity (Cottle et al. 2013 ). The African species, H. capsulatum var duboisii, is associated with cutaneous lesions and occasionally infection of long bones (Hoar et al. 1998) .",

Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease caused by Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii spp., which are predominant in arid zones of the American continent, mainly in the Southwestern United States and the northern states of Mexico, as well as other regions with different environmental conditions (Welsh et al. 2012) . Some countries of Central and South America are also endemic zones. Most infected patients are asymptomatic. Disseminated disease develops in less than 5 % of clinically affected individuals. Culture, biopsy, and DNA probes are used for fungus identification. Prognosis is related to low antibody detection and a positive intradermic skin reaction to coccidioidin. Immunosuppressed patients and pregnant women require special attention in diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. Amphotericin B in its different forms, itraconazole, and fluconazole, are the most frequently used treatments. Both fungi have been detected in bats and bat guano (Krutzsch and Watson 1978; Cordeiro et al. 2012) . In Brazil, Coccidioides posadasii was recovered from Carollia perspicillata bat lungs (Cordeiro et al. 2012) . Immunologic studies detected coccidioidal antibodies and antigens in Glossophaga soricina and Desmodus rotundus bats.",

It was indicated that bat consumption is common in that country and people could get infected by improper handling of bats or consumption of raw or undercooked bat meat (Oyeka 1994) . In a recent study conducted in Brazil, 7 (12.3 %) of 57 bats showed yeasts in their feces.

Blastomycosis is a granulomatous disease of mucous membranes. Blastomyces dermatitidis has been isolated from the lungs of an asymptomatic insectivorous bat ( Rhinopoma hardwickei hardwickei) from India, and insectivorous bats orally inoculated with B. dermatitidis transiently shed viable organisms in their feces. Mexican free-tailed bats ( Tadarida brasiliensis) intraperitoneally injected with B. dermatitidis developed systemic blastomycosis and excreted viable fungi in their feces. Apparently, bats can serve as both hosts and vectors for B. dermatitidis and may be potential sources for human infection (Raymond et al. 1997 ).",
