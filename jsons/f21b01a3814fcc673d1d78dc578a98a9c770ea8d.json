Such terrorism can also be run on low budgets, as the only costs incurred are those related to interference with the computer programs of a State, through the purchase of the necessary computer equipment. 1 The unavoidable challenge posed by cyber terrorism is that our digital world, which allows us to create and share knowledge, also provides ample opportunity for terrorists to commit cyber crimes. The digital environment nurtures motivated offenders who are able to explore covert capabilities for exploiting vulnerabilities in that environment. Thus, limiting the opportunities for subterfuge is another challenge to be faced in the development of the cyber environment. Currently, the most ominous obstacle to be overcome is the lack of guards to prevent crimes against the digital world. 2 In considering the above, we must first establish the difference, if any, between cyber crime and cyber terrorism and determine whether there are any common links. Cyber crime was termed \"computer 3 crime\" in the early stages of its evolution and has also been called \"computer related crime\" or \"crime by computer\". 4 At its most basic, cyber terrorism may be defined as \"an assault on electronic In taking action against cyber crimes, then President Bill Clinton, in a 1999 speech to the National Academy of Sciences said: \"open borders and revolutions in technology have spread the message and the gifts of freedom, but have also given new opportunities to freedom's enemies. . . we must be ready. . . ready if our adversaries try to use computers to disable power grids, banking, communications and transportation networks, police, fire, and health services -or military assets. 18 In order to achieve this objective\", President Clinton outlined a strategy based on a new programme \"Cyber Corps\" that would be in addition to and augment government efforts already in place to counter cyber terrorism, at the same time initiating new strategies calculated to strengthen the protection of critical systems. The President stated that he would seek the support of Congress to allocate $1.46 billion in the next federal budget for this strategy, 19 involving a 40% increase from previous spending on related efforts. This proposed measure was opportune as, according to a 2002 survey conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a San Francisco-based computer security institute, 90% of large corporations and government agencies in the United States had experienced unauthorized computer breaches in 2001. 20 Under then President George Bush, the United States adopted, in 2003, a National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, aimed at preventing cyber attacks against critical American infrastructures, reducing national vulnerability to cyber attacks and minimizing damage and recovery time from actual cyber attacks. 21 The Strategy defines the national priority as securing the government's cyberspace and national security and initiating international cooperation on cyberspace security. The strategy would be supported by a response system, threat and vulnerability reduction programme, and awareness and training programme, for national cyberspace security. A significant principle of this strategy was its recognition that efforts to counter cyber terrorism should involve strong, proactive collaboration between those providing essential services in the United States, since the federal government could not-and should not-secure nor interfere with the computer networks of banks, energy companies, transportation firms, and other activities of the private sector. Similarly, the federal government should not intrude into the computer networks of homes and small businesses, universities, and State and local agencies and departments. The Strategy therefore exhorted each American who depends on cyberspace and information networks to secure the part that they own or for which they are responsible.",

            "text": "The annual Threat Assessment of the United States Intelligence Community for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 22 of 2010 shows the extent of the cyber terrorism threat in its statement that the agility and technological innovation demonstrated by the cyber criminal sector far exceeds the response capability of network defenders. The Threat Assessment identified two components as particularly vulnerable to cyber attack: Network Convergence, the merging of distinct voice and data technologies to the point where all communications are relayed over a common network structure; and Channel Consolidation, the concentration of data on individual users captured by service providers through e-mails or instant messages. The Threat Assessment drew an implicit parallel between cyber terrorism and international organized crime, extrapolating the theory that international criminal organizations will increasingly hinder the ability of legitimate businesses to compete and may even push legitimate players out of the market. 23 Further, whether conducted by an individual, a corporation or a State, cyber terrorism has the potential to target the electronic systems of companies that design and develop hardware and software used at airports and in air traffic control systems. Such terrorism may also target industries involved in the construction of aircraft and components, whether they are used for civil or military purposes. One commentator says: [h] ere, the objective is that of manipulating, in the design phase, software orhardware which will eventually come to be used in critical environments. The eventslinked to the theft of designs relating to the American F-35 project are an exampleof this kind of act. 24 A review conducted in 2010 by the United States Government reported that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) computer systems remained vulnerable to cyber attacks, since most air traffic control facilities had not been enhanced to adequately respond to cyber intrusions. 25 The threat of cyber terrorism was 22 Threat Assessment of the United States Intelligence Community for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 2 February 2010, ATA February 2010 -Intelligence Community Statement for the Record, at 3, see http://www.cfr.org/intelligence/annual-threat-assessment-intelligence-communitysenate-select-committee-intelligence-2010/p21369. 23 It is disturbing that a recent study from the Department of Homeland Security highlighted how the information technology systems of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, which are used by the National Cyber Security Division in its mission to be the focal point in terms of cyber security, both at the public and private levels, suffer from numerous and dangerous vulnerabilities linked above all to the problem of a poor information technology security culture amongst its employees, see Department of Homeland Security (DHS) -Office of Inspector General, \"DHS Needs to Improve the Security Posture of Its Cybersecurity Program Systems\", at http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_10-111_Aug10.pdf. 24 Stefano Male, Cyber Warfare and its Damaging Effects on Citizens, September 2010, at https:// www.infosecisland.com/download/index/id/30.html. 25 Lolita C. Baldor, Cyber Security Still Issue for FAA, Boston Globe, 13 August 2010, at http:// www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/08/13/cyber_security_still_issue_for_faa. A Department of Energy report released in May 2009 documented successful attacks that have affected FAA networks. In 2006, the FAA shut down a \"portion of its air traffic control systems in considered with regard to the Boeing Dreamliner 787, whereby the FAA reportedly claimed that \"the plane may be at risk for hacking on to its on-board computer system, with disastrous consequences\". 26 In an aviation context, therefore, cyber terrorism has multiple facets that can disrupt air transport in many ways. Acts of cyber terrorism could be used to spread disinformation or engage in psychological warfare, with media attention being manipulated regarding possible threats, leading to disruptions in airport and aircraft operations. The end result would be a \"fear factor\", such as was seen in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, where individuals displayed increased reluctance to travel. This could, in turn, result in economic losses, particularly in States that are dependent on the tourism industry to boost their Gross National Products. At the most serious level, cyber terrorism could lead to fatalities, injuries and major damage at airports and to aircraft in flight. 27",

This clearly refers, inter alia, to cyber terrorism, yet links the offence exclusively to the safety of aircraft in flight.

For instance if, as a result of an act of cyber terrorism, a taxiing aircraft collided with an aircraft that had opened its doors for disembarkation, but passengers were still on board, such an act would not be considered an offence in terms of the passengers in the process of disembarkation. That is, the offender(s) would not be committing an offence under the convention either against the second aircraft or its disembarking passengers. Nonetheless, the Beijing Convention of 2010 is an initial step toward countering the threat of cyber terrorism, a threat directed often toward the target of air transport.",

States Parties to the Convention therefore expressed their view in a Preambular Clause that cooperation between States and private industry in combating cyber crime was necessary and that there was a need to protect legitimate interests in the use and development of information technology.

Quantum cryptography transmits information along cables by polarized photons rather than electronic signals. These photons are tiny particles of light sensitive enough that they immediately become corrupted when intercepted, thus rendering their message unintelligible and alerting both sender and recipient to the attempt at fraud or spying. The use of the PKD technique in passports provides a good example. In this case, the PKD is designed and proposed for use by customs and immigration authorities who verify biometric details in an electronic passport. The PKD is based on cryptography, an already viable tool that is now considered by the aviation community as a fail-safe method for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of passport information.",

The Bill refers to specific aspects of the rules governing lawful access, an investigative technique used by law enforcement agencies and national security agencies. The Bill was aimed at protecting victims against new technologies such as wireless data networks and voice over Internet protocol, which often present obstacles to the lawful interception of communications. Since such technologies can create \"intercept safe havens\" where criminal groups are able to operate without being detected, and in light of factors such as the deregulation of the telecommunications market, the Bill was intended to respond to the growing complexity of telephone networks that makes investigators' work more difficult and may result in delays in identifying suspects. 40 An agent of the State is defined as a peace officer, and a person acting under the authority of, or in cooperation with, a peace officer.",

Quite apart from the criminality of the assassination, the issue of the use of forged passport was brought to bear by some countries which alleged that the perpetrators of the crime had allegedly forged passports that seemingly belonged to those countries.

The diplomatic impasse occurred when three Australians from Victoria living in Israel at the time were confirmed among 26 people from four nations whose tampered passports were allegedly used by a team of suspected Israeli Mossad agents who assassinated al-Mabhouh. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is reported to have stated that Australia would be vocal in its contempt of any State if it were found that it \". . . has been complicit in the use or abuse of the Australian passport system, let alone for the conduct of an assassination, and has treated Australia with contempt and there will therefore be action by the Australian government in response\". 48 Dubai authorities are reported to have said that they were virtually certain Israeli agents carried out the killing and had released the identities of 11 people who travelled on forged British, Irish, French and German passports to kill al-Mabhouh in a hotel. 49 There is seemingly a history behind alleged Mossad involvement in the use of fake foreign passports in its activities. Reportedly, in 2004 New Zealand's prime minister imposed diplomatic sanctions -restricting visas and cancelling high level visits -after two Mossad agents were caught trying to acquire passports fraudulently -one in the name of a tetraplegic man.

One view is that an agency paradigm, which may in some circumstances impute to a state reprehensibility on the ground that a principal-agent relationship between the State and the perpetrator existed, can obfuscate the issue and preclude one from conducting a meaningful legal study of the State's conduct. 51 At the core of the principal-agent dilemma is the theory of complicity, which attributes liability to a State that was complicit in a private act. Hugo Grotius (1583 Grotius ( -1645 , founder of the modern natural law theory, first formulated this theory based on State responsibility that was not absolute. Grotius' theory was that although a State did not have absolute responsibility for a private offence, it could be considered complicit through the notion of patienta or receptus. 52 While the concept of patienta refers to a State's inability to prevent a wrongdoing, receptus pertains to the refusal to punish the offender.",

The case 55 involved the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission which considered the claim of the United States on behalf of the family of a United States national who was killed in a Mexican mining company where the deceased was working. The United States argued that the Mexican authorities had failed to exercise due care and diligence in apprehending and prosecuting the offender. The decision handed down by the Commission distinguished between complicity and the responsibility to punish and the Commission was of the view that Mexico could not be considered an accomplice in this case.",

The legal possibility of imposing liability upon a State wherever an official could be linked to that State encourages a State to be more cautious of its responsibility in controlling those responsible for carrying out tasks for which the State could be ultimately held responsible. In the same context, the responsibility of placing mines was attributed to Albania in the Corfu Channel case where the court attributed to Albania the responsibility, since Albania was known to have knowledge of the placement of mines although it did not know who exactly carried out the act.

The United Kingdom appeared to stress the point in the UN Security Council that Libya had failed to respond to the request for extradition of the implicated Libyan nationals, and arguably as a consequence, the Security Council adopted Resolution 731 on 21 January 1992 which expressed concerns over certain investigations which imputed reprehensibility to officials of the Libyan Government. 81 ICAO has been working on the development of passports since 1968. small panel of qualified experts including representatives of the passports and/or other border control authorities, be established: to determine the establishment of an appropriate document such as a passport card, a normal passport or an identity document with electronically or mechanically readable inscriptions that meet the requirements of document control; the best type of procedures, systems (electronic or mechanical) and equipment for use with the above documents that are within the resources and ability of Member States; the feasibility of standardizing the requisite control information and methods of providing this information through automated processes, provided that these processes would meet the requirements of security, speed of handling and economy of operation. 82 A passport asserts that the person holding the passport is a citizen of the issuing State while a visa confirms that the State issuing the visa has granted the visa holder the non-citizen privilege of entering and remaining in the territory of the issuing State for a specified time and purpose. An ePassport is a type of Machine Readable Passport (MRP) 83 with an embedded microchip that contains data printed on the data page of the passport, including biographic and biometric information of the holder, and passport data. The chip also contains security features for preventing passport fraud and forgery and misuse of data stored on the chip. ePassports are easily recognised by the international ePassport symbol on the front cover. 84 The techniques of biometrics employed in a machine readable travel document (MRTD), be it a visa or passport, 85 enable the user to uniquely encode a particular physical characteristic of a person into a biometric identifier or biometric template which can be verified by machine to confirm or deny a claim regarding a person's identity. Accordingly, biometric identification of a person either correctly establishes his identity as being consistent with what is claimed in the passport he is holding or brings to bear the possibility that the person carrying a particular passport is an imposter. A biometric is a measurable, physical characteristic or 82 See Facilitation Division, Report of the Seventh Session, 14-30 May 1968, ICAO Doc 8750-FAL/564, Agenda Item 2.3, at 2.3-4. See also AT-WP/1079, 1/12/70, Attachment A, which sets out the Terms of Reference of the Panel. 83 The machine readable passport (MRP) is a passport that has both a machine readable zone and a visual zone in the page that has descriptive details of the owner. The machine readable zone enables rapid machine clearance, quick verification and instantaneous recording of personal data. Besides these advantages, the MRP also has decided security benefits, such as the possibility of matching very quickly the identity of the MRP owner against the identities of undesirable persons, whilst at the same time offering strong safeguards against alteration, counterfeit or forgery.

In the modern context, biometrics are usually incorporated in an MRTD with a view to achieving five goals, the first of which is global interoperability 87 enabling the specifications of biometrics deployed in travel documents across the world to be applied and used in a universally operable manner. This is a critical need if the smooth application of biometric technology were to be ensured across borders. The second goal is to ensure uniformity within States in specific standard setting by States authorities who deploy biometrics in travel documents issued by them. The third is technical reliability, where States are required to ensure that technologies used in deploying biometrics are largely failure-proof and of sufficient quality and standard to ensure a State immigration authority reading documents issued by other States can determine that the details in the document do provide accurate verification of facts. Fourthly, the technology used has to be practical and not give rise to the need for applying disparate types of support technology at unnecessary cost and inconvenience to the user. The final goal is to ensure that the technology used will be sufficiently up to date for at least 10 years and also be backwardly compatible with new techniques to be introduced in the future.",

This measure not only ensures that the holder of the document is the legitimate claimant to that document and to whom it was issued, but also enhances the efficacy of any advance passenger information (API) 89 system used by the State to predetermine the arrivals to its territory. Furthermore, matching biometric data presented in the form of the traveler with the data contained in the template accurately ascertains as to whether the travel document has been tampered with or not. A three way check, which matches the traveler's biometrics with those stored in the template carried in the document and a central database, is an even more efficacious way of determining the genuineness of a travel document. The final and most efficient biometric check is when a four way determine is effected, were the digitized photograph is visually matched (non electronically) with the three way check described above. 90 In this context, it is always recommended that the traveler's facial image (conventional photograph) should be incorporated in the travel document along with the biometric templates in order to ensure that his identity could be verified at locations where there is no direct access to a central database or where the biometric identification process has not entered into the legal process of that location.",

            "text": "Any diplomatic action in the context of the issues raised in this article must primarily be based on State responsibility. In turn, and as already discussed, the issue of responsibility hinges on knowledge, complicity and condonation of a State. The responsibility of a State is determined by the quantum of proof available that could establish intent or negligence of the State, which in turn would establish complicity or condonation on the part of the State concerned. One way to determine complicity or condonation is to establish the extent to which the State adhered to the obligation imposed upon it by international law and whether it breached its duty to others. In order to exculpate itself, the State concerned will have to demonstrate that either it did not tolerate the offence or that it ensured the punishment of the 91 Machine Readable Travel Documents, ICAO Doc 9303 Part 1, Machine Readable Passports, Sixth Edition, 2006, III-4. 92 Annex 9 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, 12th Edition, 2006. offender. Brownlie is of the view that proof of such breach would lie in the causal connection between the offender and the State. 93 In this context, the act or omission on the part of a State is a critical determinant particularly if there is no specific intent. 94 Generally, it is not the intent of the offender that is the determinant but the failure of a State to perform its legal duty in either preventing the offence (if such was within the purview of the State) or in taking necessary action with regard to punitive action or redress. 95 There are a few principles that have to be taken into account when determining State responsibility. Firstly, there has to be either intent on the part of the State towards complicit or negligence reflected by act or omission. Secondly, where condonation is concerned, there has to be evidence of inaction on the part of the State in prosecuting the offender. Thirdly, since the State as an abstract entity cannot perform an act in itself, the imputability or attribution of State responsibility for acts of its agents has to be established through a causal nexus that points the finger at the State as being responsible. For example, The International Law Commission, in Article 4 of its Articles of State Responsibility states that the conduct of any State organ which exercises judicial, legislative or executive functions could be considered an act of State and as such the acts of such organ or instrumentality can be construed as being imputable to the State. This principle was endorsed in 1999 by the ICJ which said that according to well established principles of international law, the conduct of any organ of a state must be regarded as an act of State. 96 The law of State responsibility has evolved through the years, from being a straightforward determination of liability of the State and its agents to a rapidly widening gap between the State and non State parties. In today's world private entities and persons could wield power similar to that of a State, bringing to bear the compelling significance and modern relevance of the agency nexus between the State and such parties. This must indeed make States more aware of their own susceptibility.",

            "text": "The United Nations General Assembly, in 2002 adopted Resolution A 56/83 97 on the subject of Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts. The Resolution, which was the result of work of the International Law Commission on the subject, provides that every internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State 98 and that such an act is attributable to that State under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that State. Article 5 to the Annex to the Resolution states that the conduct of a 93 Brownlie (1983 person or entity which is not an organ of a State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance. If, as alleged, the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was carried out by Mossad, which reports to the Isreali Prime Minister, Article 8 of the Annex to the Resolution is particularly relevant as it provides that the conduct of a person or group of persons would be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct. The Resolution also recognizes that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. 99 Diplomatic relations between States are intrinsically linked to State responsibility and are based on relations between States dependent on comity. 100 The fundamental fact in this context is that international society is not an unchanging entity, but is subject to the ebb and flow of political life and activity. 101 Analogies to diplomatic relations between States arise often in the context of terrorism as in the 1985 Rainbow Warrior case. The sinking of the ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in New Zealand as a result of an officially organized undercover French military operation calculated to obstruct Greenpeace protests against French nuclear operations in the South Pacific is a good example. The destruction of the ship, which resulted in the death of a Dutch seaman, was directly attributable to the placing of explosives by an agency reporting to the French Ministry of Defence. This was construed by the Government of New Zealand and by the High Court of New Zealand as a violation of the principles of international law against the sovereignty of the country. 102 The Secretary General of the United Nations ruled that France should offer New Zealand an apology and that compensation should follow to the amount of $ 7,000,000. The Rainbow Warrior incident goes down in the annals of diplomatic relations as an act of international delinquency resulting in the criminal responsibility of a State.",

            "text": "Another analogous diplomatic incident occurred in 1981 when, on May 6, the US Department of State announced at a special press briefing that the United States Government had decided to require the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 99 Id, Article 12. 100 In law, comity specifically refers to legal reciprocity -the principle that one jurisdiction will extend certain courtesies to other nations (or other jurisdictions within the same nation), particularly by recognizing the validity and effect of their executive, legislative, and judicial acts. The term refers to the idea that courts should not act in a way that demeans the jurisdiction, laws, or judicial decisions of another jurisdiction. Part of the presumption of comity is that other jurisdictions will reciprocate the courtesy shown to them. 101 See generally Jennings and Watts (1992), Lauterpacht (1947) , Chen (1951), Shaw (2003 to close its People's Bureau at Washington immediately and to withdraw all personnel within five working days. The Department's official statement was that from the first days of the Administration, both the President and the Secretary of State had made known their very real concern about a wide range of Libyan provocations and misconduct, including support for international terrorism. The United States made it officially clear that it had been concerned by a general pattern of unacceptable conduct by the People's Bureau in Washington, which was contrary to internationally accepted standards of diplomatic behaviour. The United States therefore asked the Libyans to close their People's Bureau in Washington and have given them five working days starting today to withdraw their personnel. This action reduced US relations with Libya to the lowest level consistent with maintenance of diplomatic relations and was followed with a travel advisory which stated that due to unsettled relations between the United States and the Government of Libya, the Department of State warned American citizens against any travel to or residence in Libya. Travellers were also informed that the US Embassy in Tripoli was closed and the US was not in a position to provide consular protection and assistance to Americans presently in Libya. 103 In 1999, the Clinton administration warned Russia to voluntarily reduce the large number of intelligence officers operating in the United States or face cutbacks in diplomatic positions or expulsions. U.S. Ambassador James Collins delivered the message in Moscow during a meeting with Vladimir Putin, the former KGB domestic spying chief and currently Russia's top Security Council adviser, according to administration officials familiar with the issue. The warning followed two expulsions of Russian intelligence officers from the United States and the ouster of a U.S. Army attach\u00e9 from Moscow a month earlier. 104 The international treaty regulating diplomatic relations is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. 105 The Convention does not explicitly make provision for the right to break diplomatic relations. It follows by implication from Article 2 which provides that the establishment of diplomatic relations takes place by mutual consent that if either State withdraws that consent diplomatic relations are broken. Breach therefore takes place normally in consequence of a unilateral act -even though it frequently follows a sequence of reciprocal or retaliatory moves between two States to downgrade their relations or a collective political decision by a number of States directed against another State whose conduct is regarded as unacceptable. Relations are broken from the moment of the initial action. 106 limitations on the right of a State to break diplomatic relations with another, but the action is now invariably taken for political reasons. Practical considerations will almost always favour the continuation of relations, though not necessarily the retention of a permanent mission. This has become more obvious in the light of some recent cases where diplomatic relations subsisted even while armed conflict was taking place between sending and receiving States -as between India and Pakistan in 1965 and A breach of diplomatic relations generally precludes direct contact between sending and receiving States other than what is needed to effect orderly departure and some form of interim regime. It does not, however, preclude the sending and receiving of special missions (which may later herald a resumption of normal diplomatic relations), meetings between diplomatic representatives of the two States in a third State (for example the regular meetings in Warsaw over many years of representatives of the United States and of the People's Republic of China) or contacts between representatives of the two States to an international organization. Detailed rules on permissible contacts are usually provided in the internal diplomatic service regulations of each State. It is often a feature of modern diplomacy that those on occasion a much-advertised breach of relations may turn out to be only partially real. This occurs when two States, having broken off diplomatic relations, usually on the initiative of one of them, continue an active, if quiet, direct relationship despite the appointment of third States to protect the interests of each in the territory of the other State. 107 Whatever unilateral diplomatic action an aggrieved State might take, be it on grounds of sovereignty or the violation of its national property (passports) and the rights of its citizens who held the passports, there are certain legal nuances in the Mahmoud al-Mabhouh case which are incontrovertible. Falsification of passports and identity theft are serious criminal offences under most national laws. It could well be that these are also offences under the laws of Israel. Falsification of a national passport, whatever its country or nationality might be, by a member of the Israeli intelligence services brings to bear issues that are much more serious than mere breaches of diplomatic courtesy or relations. Under the theory of condonation any government involved would be seriously implicated, were it to turn out that it was aware that falsified travel documents were being used by its security agency as has been suggested by some.",

Then, as the displacement theory 111 demonstrated, terrorists moved their attention towards attacking airports, which prompted States to install screening equipment at centralized points in the terminal itself. In similar vein, in the aftermath of the attempted bombing of an aircraft on 25 December 2009 by a person who is alleged to have carried explosives in his undergarments, some States began to look seriously into tightening airport security, particularly through a more stringent body scanning process. While the United States toughened screening measures on US bound flights, particularly with regard to passengers arriving from 14 targeted nations, 112 airports in the United Kingdom began the use of full body scanners at both Heathrow and Manchester airports. 113 In Canada, Rob Merrifield, Minister of State for Transport is reported to have stated that 44 scanners have been ordered to be used on passengers selected for secondary screening at Canadian airports. The machines, which can scan through clothing, will be installed in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax. 114 This measure is partly due to the fact that the Christmas day incident was later classified as having occurred due to a serious lapse in security.",

However, it should be noted that this is just one more reactive step -to ensure that no person enters an aircraft with explosives hidden in his underwear -and the only known way to respond to this new threat is to use full body scanner. The question then arises as to whether the responsibility of the State toward its constituents and those using aircraft for transport from and to their territory, to prevent private acts of terrorism overrides the right of privacy of the individual. This article will address the balance between the two interests.",

In his message to the Conference in Chicago, President Roosevelt said: \"the Conference is a great attempt to build enduring institutions of peace, which cannot be endangered by petty considerations or weakened by groundless fears\". 121 The Chicago Convention embodies in its Preamble the need to create and preserve friendship and understanding among the nations and peoples of the world, and cautions Contracting States that the abuse of this friendship and understanding can become a threat to general security. Article 13 of the Convention provides that the laws and regulations of a Contracting State as to the admission to and departure from its territory of passengers, crew or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within the territory of that State. This provision ensures that a Contracting State has the right to prescribe its own internal laws with regard to passenger clearance and leaves room for a State to enact laws, rules and regulations to ensure the security of that State and its people at the airport. However, this absolute right is qualified so as to preclude unfettered and arbitrary power of a State, by Article 22 which makes each Contracting State agree to adopt all practicable measures, through the issuance of special regulations or otherwise, to facilitate and expedite navigation of aircraft between the countries.",

The emergence of the information superhighway and the concomitant evolution of automation have inevitably transformed the social and personal life styles and value systems of individuals, created unexpected business opportunities, reduced operating costs, accelerated transaction times, facilitated accessibility to communications, shortened distances, and removed bureaucratic formalities. 128 Progress notwithstanding, technology has bestowed on humanity its corollaries in the nature of automated mechanisms, devices, features, and procedures which intrude into personal lives of individuals. For instance, when a credit card is used, it is possible to track purchases, discovering numerous aspects about that particular individual, including, food inclination, leisure activities, and consumer credit behaviour. 129 In similar vein, computer records of an air carrier's reservation system may give out details of the passenger's travel preferences, inter alia, seat selection, destination fondness, ticket purchasing dossier, lodging keenness, temporary address and telephone contacts, attendance at theatres and sport activities, and whether the passenger travels alone or with someone else. 130 In similar vein, does it follow that a full body scanning exercise would reveal imperfections of the human body which person would desire to keep private? This scheme of things may well give the outward perception of surveillance attributable to computer devices 126 As far back as in 1973 it was claimed that ten reels, each containing 1,500 m of tape 2.5 cm wide, could store a 20 page dossier on every man, woman, and child in the world. See Jones (1973) . 127 Westin (1970) . 128 Orwell (1978) . 129 For a detailed analysis of the implications of credit cards with respect to the right of privacy see Nock (1993) . 130 The paramount importance of airline computer reservation system records is reflected in the world-renowned cases Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America regarding the PANAM 103 accident at Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, where the International Court of Justice requested air carriers to submit to the Court the defendants' flight information and reservation details. See International Court of Justice. News Release 99/36, \"Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie\" (1 July 1999), online: http://www.icj-cij.org/ icjwww/idocket/iluk/iluk2frame.html (date accessed: 14 July 2000). In a similar vein, Arthur R. Miller describes the significance of airline computer reservation system records when dealing with federal, state, local, and other types of investigations where these dossiers could provide valuable information. See also Miller(1971) . monitoring individuals' most intimate activities, preferences and physical attributes, leading to the formation of a genuine \"traceable society\". 131 The main feature of this complex web of technological activity is that an enormous amount of personal information handled by such varied players from the public and private sector, may bring about concerns of possible \"data leaks\" in the system, a risk that could have drastic legal consequences affecting an individual's rights to privacy.",

            "text": "Privacy represents different things for different people. 134 The concept per se has evolved throughout the history of mankind, from the original non-intrusion approach, which defended an individual's property and physical body against unwanted invasions and intrusions, then manifesting in whom to associate with, later enlarging its scope to include privacy as the individual's decision-making right, 135 and culminating in the control over one's personal information. 136 Thus, the conceptual evolution of privacy is directly related to the technological advancement of each particular period in history. 131 See Scott (1995) , Burnham (1983) . A contrario to the argument supported in this thesis that the advancement of technology directly affects the intimacy of individuals. U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner favours the idea that other factors, such as urbanisation, income, and mobility development have particularly weakened the information control that, for instance, the government has over individuals: this denotes that individuals' privacy has increased. See Posner (1978) . 132 The text reads: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\". Regan (1995) , Freund (1971) . 135 In this case, the US Supreme Court acknowledged the right of women to have abortions based on the grounds that the federal government could not interfere within her \"decisional privacy\" sphere. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973) . See also Cate (1997) , Zelermyer (1959) . 136 In a remarkable case concerning the legality of a national census scheduled by the authorities, the German Constitutional court connected the individual's liberty and the personal data processing of the intended census, to rule that if the individuals do not know for what purposes and who is collecting the data, that situation will eventually create an abdication of the individual's rights to the processor's command, \"which cannot be tolerated in a democratic society\". See Simitis (1995) . See also Hoffer (2000) , Gavison (1980) . The right of privacy, as enunciated by the United States Judge Thomas M. Cooley, was the right \"to be let alone\" as a part of a more general right to one's personality. This idea was given further impetus by two prominent young lawyers, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, 137 in 1890. 138 Before this idea was introduced, the concept of privacy reflected primarily a somewhat physical property or life. The foundations of \"information privacy\", whereby the individuals would determine when, how, and to what extent information about themselves would be communicated to others, inextricably drawing the right of control of information about oneself, 139 is a cornerstone of privacy. With the development of computer capabilities to handle large amounts of data, privacy has been enlarged to include the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information. 140 The notion of informational privacy protection, a typically American usage, has been particularly popular both in the United States and Europe, where the term \"data protection\" is used. 141 Self-determination in the right to protect one's privacy was first judicially embraced by the German Bundesverfassungsgericht in 1983. The US Supreme court followed this trend by adopting the principle of privacy self-determination in DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press. 142 It must be borne in mind that privacy is not an absolute, unlimited right that operates and applies in isolation. 143 It is not an absolute right, applied unreservedly, to the exclusion of other rights. Hence there is frequently the necessity to balance privacy rights with other conflictive rights, such as the freedom of speech and the right to access information when examining individuals' rights vis-a`-vis the interest of society. 144 This multiplicity of interests will prompt courts to adopt a balanced approach when adjudicating on a person's rights, particularly whose interests of a State are involved. 137 See Cooley (1888) , as cited in Warren and Brandeis (1980) . 138 The definition of privacy as the \"Right to be Alone\" is often erroneously attributed to Warren and Brandeis. See Warren & Brandeis. See Cooley (1888) as cited in Warren and Brandeis (1980) . Additionally the concept of privacy as \"the right to be let alone\", and \"the right most valued by civilized man: was embraced by US courts in the landmark dissenting opinion of Justice Louis D. 438, 478 (1928) [hereinafter Olmstead.] 139 See Westin (1967) . For a similar conceptualisation of privacy, see Fried (1978) . 140 See Reidenberg (1995) . 141 The former Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Canada, has asserted that privacy was originally a \"non-legal concept\". See Flaherty (1991) . The term \"data protection\" has been translated from the German word Datenschutz, referring to a set of policies seeking to regulate the collection, storage, use, and transfer of personal information. See Bennet (1992 Simmel (1971) . 144 See Halpin (1997) . See also Foschio (1990) . For a comprehensive study on the conflictive interest on privacy and the mass media and the Freedom of Speech, see Pember (1972), Prowda (1995) . See also J.

In such instances, minorities frequently intensify their efforts to preserve and protect their identity, in order to avoid marginalization. Polarization between the opposite forces of assimilation on the one hand and protection of minority identity on the other inevitably causes increased intolerance and eventual armed ethnic conflict. In such a scenario, the first duty of governance is to ensure that the rights of a minority society are protected.",

The only factor that would override this would be the security of State. Inherent to the concept of security of State is State responsibility to its citizens and others who are in its territory. The fundamental issue in the context of State responsibility for the purposes of this article is to consider whether a State should be considered responsible for its own failure or non-feasance to prevent a private act of terrorism against civil aviation or whether the conduct of the State itself can be impugned by identifying a nexus between the perpetrator's conduct and the State. One view is that an agency paradigm, which may in some circumstances impute to a state reprehensibility on the ground that a principal-agent relationship between the State and the perpetrator existed, can obfuscate the issue and preclude one from conducting a meaningful legal study of the State's conduct. 148 At the core of the principal-agent dilemma is the theory of complicity, which attributes liability to a State that was complicit in a private act. Hugo Grotius (1583 Grotius ( -1645 , founder of the modern natural law theory, first formulated this theory based on State responsibility that was not absolute. Grotius' theory was that although a State did not have absolute responsibility for a private offence, it could be considered complicit through the notion of patienta or receptus. 149 While the concept of patienta refers to a State's inability to prevent a wrongdoing, receptus pertains to the refusal to punish the offender.",

The case 152 involved the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission which considered the claim of the United States on behalf of the family of a United States national who was killed in a Mexican mining company where the deceased was working. The United States argued that the Mexican authorities had failed to exercise due care and diligence in apprehending and prosecuting the offender. The decision handed down by the Commission distinguished between complicity and the responsibility to punish and the Commission was of the view that Mexico could not be considered an accomplice in this case.",

The United Nations General Assembly, on 9 December 1999, adopted the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 157 aimed at enhancing international co-operation among States in devising and adopting effective measures for the prevention of the financing of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of its perpetrators.",

A perceived inadequacy of the global framework of aviation security is the lack of an implementation arm. ICAO has taken extensive measures to introduce relevant international conventions as well as Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention. There is also a highly classified Aviation Security Manual developed by ICAO which is provided to States. Additionally, the Organization provides focused security training courses to its member States.

With regard to an amendment to Annex 17 in this regard, the need for introducing unpredictability into the aviation security regime was considered, and it was agreed that unpredictability should be promoted in principle but not prescribed. The Panel suggested that if an Annex 17 specification related to unpredictability were to be developed, it would be necessary to ensure that the introduction of this concept by States does not diminish the level of security or result in delays for passengers.

The Air Transport Association (ATA), in its 2002 State of the United States Airline Industry Statement, advised that, in the United States, the combined impact of the 2001 economic downturn and the precipitous decline in air travel following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States resulted in devastating losses for the airline industry which are likely to exceed $7 billion and continue through 2002. 173 Of course, the overall picture, which portended a certain inevitable gloom for the air transport industry, was not the exclusive legacy of United States' carriers. It applied worldwide, as was seen in the abrupt downfall of air traffic globally during 2001. The retaliation by the world community against terrorism, which is an ongoing feature in world affairs, increased the airline passenger's fear and reluctance to use air transport. In most instances in commercial aircraft purchasing, air carriers cancelled or postponed their new aircraft requisition orders. Many carriers, particularly in developing countries, were seen revisiting their cost structures and downsizing their human resource bases. It is incontrovertible that another similar event or series of events will inevitably plunge the aviation industry into similar despair and destitution.",

It has also to be noted that under the Chicago Convention, a State has the right to request information in order for proper border control to be established. 189 Therefore, this is a matter of national policy which is further buttressed by the concept of sovereignty of nations. 190 The United States is arguably one of the most active jurisdictions in adopting recent legislation with regard to airline passengers carried into the territory of a State. On 19 November 2001, The President signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act which added on a new requirement that each carrier, foreign and domestic, operating a passenger flight involving foreign air transportation into the United States, must transmit to the US Customs electronically and in advance of the arrival of the flight, a related passenger manifest and crew manifest containing certain specifically required information of such persons. Following this law, the Customs authorities of the United States published an interim rule 191 in the Federal Register on 31 December 2001 which requires air carriers, for each flight subject to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, to transmit to Customs, by means of an electronic data interchange system approved by Customs, a passenger manifest and, by way of a separate transmission, using the same system, a crew manifest. 187 \" [. . .] This technique is beginning to be used by Border Control Agencies and it has the potential to reduce considerably the inconvenience and delay experienced by some travelers due to border controls.\" Facilitation Division-Eleventh Session, (1995) ICAO Doc FAL/11-IP/2. 188 Refer to Recommendation Practice 3.34 of Annex 9: \"Where appropriate Contracting States should introduce a system of advanced passenger information which involves the capture of certain passport or visa details prior to departure, the transmission of the details by electronic means to public authorities, and the analysis of such data for risk management purposes prior to arrival in order to expedite clearance. To minimize handling time during check-in, document reading devices should be used to capture the information in machine readable travel documents. When specifying the identifying information on passengers to be transmitted, Contracting States should only require information that is found in the machine readable zones of passports and visas that comply with the specifications contained in Doc 9303 (series), Machine Readable Travel Documents. All information required should conform to specifications for UN/EDIFACT PAXLST message formats. 189 Chicago Convention-Art. 13: \"The laws and regulations of a contracting State as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew or cargo of aircraft, such as the regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within the territory of that State.\" 190 Chicago Convention-Art. 1: \"The contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory.\" 191 66 FR 67482.",

These lists are maintained by individual States (and not by Organizations such as ICAO) where such States effectively preclude the travel of a potentially dangerous passenger. This is a matter purely for the State concerned as the prerogative of admitting a person to its territory lies exclusively on the State. However, the maintenance of a no fly list is not a fool proof measure as there have been occasions (such as when an 8 year old boy who shared the same name with a suspect on a no fly list was patted down by Customs authorities every time he travelled). 192 A potentially dangerous passenger can be identified either by spontaneous offensive conduct at the pre-boarding stage, a name-match or by criminal profiling, which is an investigative technique based on knowledge of the human personality and various psychological disorders that afflict the human being. However, a no fly list in particular may well raise the issue of privacy, particularly in instances of the false positive. The data subject, like any other person, has an inherent right to his privacy. The subject of privacy has been identified as an intriguing and emotive one. 193 The right to privacy is inherent in the right to liberty, and is the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized man. 194 This right is susceptible to being eroded, as modern technology is capable of easily recording and storing dossiers on every man, woman and child in the world. 195 The data subject's right to privacy, when applied to the context of the machine readable travel document (MRTD) is brought into focus by Alan Westin who says:",

For instance, when a credit card is used, it is possible to track purchases, discovering numerous aspects about that particular individual, including, food inclination, leisure activities, and consumer credit behaviour. 199 In similar vein, computer records of an air carrier's reservation system may give out details of the passenger's travel preferences, inter alia, seat selection, destination fondness, ticket purchasing dossier, lodging keenness, temporary address and telephone contacts, attendance at theatres and sport activities, and whether the passenger travels alone or with someone else. 200 This scheme of things may well give the outward perception of surveillance attributable to computer devices monitoring individuals' most intimate activities and preferences, leading to the formation of a genuine \"traceable society\". 201 The above notwithstanding, it must be borne in mind that privacy is not an absolute, unlimited right that operates and applies in isolation. 202 It is not an absolute right, applied unreservedly, to the exclusion of other rights. Hence there is frequently the necessity to balance privacy rights with other conflictive rights, such as the freedom of speech and the right to access information when examining individuals' rights vis-a`-vis the interest of society. 203 This multiplicity of interests 198 See generally Orwell (1984) . 199 For a detailed analysis of the implications of credit cards with respect to the right of privacy see Nock (1993) . 200 The paramount importance of airline computer reservation system records is reflected in the world-renowned cases Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America regarding the PANAM 103 accident at Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, where the International Court of Justice requested air carriers to submit to the Court the defendants' flight information and reservation details.

In a similar vein, Arthur R. Miller describes the significance of airline computer reservation system records when dealing with federal, state, local, and other types of investigations where these dossiers could provide valuable information.

U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner favours the idea that other factors, such as urbanisation, income, and mobility development have particularly weakened the information control that, for instance, the government has over individuals: this denotes that individuals' privacy has increased.

The Act empowered law enforcement agencies to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States. It also extended the powers of the Secretary of State to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts.

The term \"terrorism\" is seemingly of French origin and is believed to have been first used in 1798. \"Terrorism\", which originally had connotations of criminality to one's conduct, is now generally considered a system of coercive intimidation brought about by the infliction of terror or fear. The most frustrating obstacle to the control of unlawful acts against international peace is the paucity of clear definition of the offence itself.

Terrorism, has involved groups seeking to overthrow specific regimes, to rectify perceived national or group grievances, or to undermine international order as an end in itself. 208 This all embracing definition underscores the misapprehension that certain groups which are etched in history such as the French Resistance of Nazi occupied France during World War 11 and the Contras in Nicaragua would broadly fall within the definitive parameters of terrorism. In fact, this formula labels every act of violence as being \"terrorist\" engulfing in its broad spectrum such diverse groups as the Seikigunha of Japan and the Mujahedeen of Afghanistan, although their aims, modus operandi and ideologies are different. James Adams prefers a narrower definition which reads: a terrorist is an individual or member of a group that wishes to achieve political ends using violent means, often at the cost of casualties to innocent civilians and with the support of only a minority of the people they claim to represent. 209 Even this definition although narrower than the 1980 definition cited above is not sufficiently comprehensive to cover for instance the terrorist who hijacks an air plane for his own personal gain. The difficulty in defining the term seems to lie in its association with political aims of the terrorist as is found in the definition that terrorism is really: terror inspired by violence, containing an international element that is committed by individuals or groups against non-combatants, civilians, States or internationally protected persons or entities in order to achieve political ends. 210",

Often, such acts of self defence prove to take extreme violent forms and manifest themselves overseas, thus giving rise to international terrorism. Acts of defence, as they are called, are common forms of international terrorism and are categorized as political violence. These acts take the form of acts of disruption, destruction, injury whose purpose, choice of targets or victims, surrounding circumstances, implementation and/or effects have political significance.",

Usually, a cause which originates as dedicated to self defence and self determination aligns itself to gaining the support of the people, disarming the military strength of the regime against which it rebels and above all seeks to strengthen itself in order that the terrorist movement attains stability. In this instance terrorist acts seek primarily to carry out a massive propaganda campaign in the international community while at the same time concentrating more on individual instances of terrorism in populated urban areas which attract attention more than those committed in isolated areas.

            "text": "There are instances where terrorism extends to destabilizing an established regime or a group of persons by the use of threats which are often calculated to instil fear in the international community. Typical examples of this kind of terrorism are the spreading of false propaganda and the invocation of threats which unhinge both the nation or a group of persons against whom the threats are carried out and the nations in which such acts are said to be committed. There have been instances in the past where export consumer commodities of a nation such as food items have been claimed to be poisoned in order that foreign trade between nations be precluded. Although such acts are devoid of actual physical violence, they tend to unhinge the economic stability of a nation particularly if such nation depends solely on the export of the item in question. In such instances, international terrorism assumes proportions of great complexity and succeeds at least temporarily to disrupt the infrastructural equilibrium of the nation against which such threat is aimed. The government concerned is immediately placed on the defensive and attempts counter-propaganda. In spreading propaganda of this nature, the media is the terrorist's best friend. He uses the media of television and radio as a symbolic weapon to instil fear in the public and to cripple the persons or government against which his attack has been aimed. The effect of publicity on people is truly tangible, whether it pertains to the statement of facts or whether it relates to the issuance of threats. Primarily, media terrorism creates an emotional state of apprehension and fear in threatened groups and secondly, draws world attention to the existence of the terrorists and their cause. In both instances, the terrorist succeeds in creating a credibility gap between his target and the rest of the world. Psychological terrorism of this nature is perhaps the most insidious of its kind. It is certainly the most devious.",

Often one observes that the terrorist cautiously retracts his steps obscuring all evidence unless he seeks publicity.

His acts are calculated to instil fright and paralyse the infrastructure of a state by totally exhausting the strength of his target. He further disarms his target by introducing the element of surprise to his attack. Perhaps the most outstanding element of a random attack is the psychological element where excessive and sporadic acts of violence instil both fear and psychological disorientation in a society. This in turn contributes to undermining and weakening a government's authority and control. The disruptive influence that terrorism of this kind exercises over society often creates disharmony within the political circles of a nation and unhinges the psychological behavioural pattern of an organized society. Most often the gap between the citizen and the established government both in the State in which the act is committed and in the state against which the act is committed is widened as the average citizen tends to regard his personal security as the most inviolate of rights that has to be protected by his government.",

We have not had the misfortune of seeing all terrorist groups band together to work as a composite element. This has not happened for the reason that diverse ideologies and religions have kept each group separate. Nevertheless, there is a strong identity bond between groups and even evidence that one helps the other with training and military aid, even though their causes are quite different. The link between terrorist groups is an important consideration for the world as close association between groups could strengthen a weak force and nurture it to maturity. In addition, strong and established terrorist organizations, under cover of burgeoning groups, could carry out campaigns which would cover their tracks and make identification difficult. In most instances, this was found to be true and investigation reveals that a small group, not too significant at that time to take account of, has been responsible for an act or acts whereas later it is revealed that a much stronger group had masterminded the offenses for its benefit. Another important feature of the growing incidence of international terrorism is the assistance the terrorists receive from the advancement of technology in communication, the manufacture of sophisticated weaponry and the proliferation of nuclear armament. In today's context, terrorism has blown to unmanageable proportions with the use of advanced weapons of destruction. Arms control plays a vital role in the control of aggression and it naturally follows that terrorism too benefits from the availability of new modes of aggression. The vulnerability of the international community has been mainly brought upon by the paucity of adequate security measures to prevent nuclear theft. With the growth of the nuclear power industry, developed nations exposed themselves to the vulnerability of theft by power groups, in whose hands nuclear weapons act as threats of destruction. The most effective counter measure that can be taken in this instance against the threat of nuclear theft is to take such effective measures as are necessary to protect the stored items and to make known to the terrorist the high risk involved in an attempt to steal such material. Ideally, any hope of theft must be obviated. This can be achieved by strengthening governmental security.",

He wants popular support and a sympathetic ear. He wants a lot of people listening and watching, not a lot of people dead. Counter measures taken against a terrorist attack, be it hostage taking, kidnapping or a threat of murder, should essentially include an effective campaign to destroy the terrorist's credibility and sincerity in the eyes of the public. Always, the loyalty of the public should be won over by the target and not by the terrorist. It is only then that the terrorist's risk outweighs the benefits he obtains. To achieve this objective it must be ensured that the terrorist receives publicity detrimental to him, showing the public that if the threatened person, group of persons or State comes to harm, the terrorist alone is responsible.

Things would be much more difficult for the terrorist if these were done. The greatest problem of deterrence is the pusillanimity of the international community in the face of terrorism and the feeble response offered by States as a composite body. The reasons for this hesitation on the part of the international community to adopt effective measures against international terrorism are by no means inexplicable. When one state supports a revolutionary cause which is aimed against another, it is quite natural that the terrorist is aware of the support he is capable of obtaining from at least one part of the already polarized world.

This right is entrenched in Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and is accepted today as constituting an obligation on all member States to recognize the legally and morally binding nature of the Declaration. Therefore the destruction of human life and the restriction of liberty are acts committed against international law and order. International terrorism destroys both life and liberty. Indeed there need be no doubt in our minds that international terrorism is illegal. To begin with, there should be more awareness in the world today that every human being has the inherent right to life and that the right is protected by law. Any act of terrorism being illegal, becomes subject to law and its punitive sanctions. However, in this instance, unlike in a simple instance of murder where sanction itself may act as a deterrent, the two forces of law and sanction are not sufficient to curb terrorism. The international community should realize that the solution to terrorism lies rather in its prevention than in its cure. Therefore the problem has to be approached solely on the basis that the terrorist on the one hand has to be dissuaded that his act may not succeed while on the other he has to be persuaded that even if he succeeded in committing the act of terrorism, it would not achieve for him the desired results. The philosophy of warfare against terrorism is therefore based on one single fact -that of convincing the terrorist that any attempt at committing a terrorist act would be fruitless and would entail for him unnecessary harm. This simple philosophy should be adopted gradually in stages with the sustained realization that each measure taken is as important as the next and that all measures should be adopted as a composite element and not as those that are mutually exclusive.",

In other words money laundering is \"the process by which the source and ownership of criminally derived wealth and property is changed to confer on it a perception of legitimacy\". 213 From the point of view of the criminal, there seem to be three basic requirements: (a) the need to conceal the true ownership and origin of the proceeds; (b) the need to maintain control of the proceeds; and (c) the need to change the form of the proceeds. 214 However, it is incontrovertible that there is a certain synergy between the two, as one feeds off the other and often the money gained from acts of terrorism are laundered and put back into funding acts of terrorism The enormity and wide-spread nature of money laundering on a global scale is reflected by the fact that the International Monetary Fund has estimated that, during the decade 1999-2009 the aggregate size of money-laundering was anywhere between 2% and 5% of the world's gross domestic product. 215 Just as an example, it is reported that in 2007, the money generated by organized crime in the United Kingdom was 15 billion Pounds Sterling, of which 10 billion was laundered. 216 The most fundamental measure taken against money laundering is to criminalize it and to adopt legislative and other measures to identify, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. To this the international effort is quite significant, particular concerning concerted action taken by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of national and international policies to combat money laundering 213 Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism, Report published by the authority of the House of Lords of England, Volume 1, 22 July 2009. See http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ moneyval/activities/UK_Parlrep.pdf. 214 Id at 7. The offences associated with money laundering are: the conversion or transfer of property for the purpose of concealing or disguising its illicit origin or of assisting any person to evade the legal consequences of his actions; the concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of criminally derived property; and the acquisition, possession or use of criminally derived property. 215 Camdessus, Michel, (Managing Director of the IMF), \"Money Laundering: the Importance of International Countermeasures\", an address to the Plenary Meeting of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in Paris, 10 February 1998. 216 Treasury (2007) . and terrorist financing. The FATF is therefore a \"policy-making body\" created in 1989 that works to generate the necessary political will to bring about legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas. 217 The FATF has recommended that: the 1999 United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions be ratified and implemented; the financing of terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist organisations be criminalized; terrorist assets be frozen and confiscated; the widest possible assistance be extended to other countries' law enforcement and regulatory authorities for terrorist financing investigations; suspicious transactions related to terrorism be reported; anti-money laundering requirements on alternative remittance systems be imposed; ensure that entities, in particular non-profit organisations, cannot be misused to finance terrorism; and customer identification measures in international and domestic wire transfers be strengthened.",

The next is to intensify security in all susceptible areas, particularly in such places as airports, subway terminals, etc. Surveillance of all people who are seen in such areas as are revealed to be targets of terrorist acts is imperative. There should be more awareness of the threat of terrorist activity particularly in international airports and international bus and train terminals where travel documents should be checked and passengers double checked. Electronic surveillance of passports and other documents have proved to be effective methods of deterrence in this context. Perhaps the most important facet of surveillance is the use of personnel who do not reveal their identity to the public but unobtrusively mingle with the crowds. This category of person can easily detect an irregularity without arousing suspicion and without alarming the common man. It is recommended that together with the armed personnel there should also be trained personnel who in all informality may work together with the security forces in such instances. Another significant requirement is the support of the people. The media should be made maximum use of to educate the common man as to how to react in an emergency and also to be totally distrustful of the terrorist whose acts are calculated to evoke sympathy. The State or persons against whom the terrorist attack is launched should, at all times, use the media to convince the public that responsibility for any destruction or harm resulting from a terrorist act devolves totally on the terrorist.",

On 25 January 2011, protests, at least partly inspired by the toppling of the authoritarian government in Tunisia, erupted in Egypt 223 and grew increasingly worse. As a result, Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt, was deposed within weeks of a virulent peoples' uprising. Contemporaneous protests went on other States such as in Algeria, Yemen, and Bahrain, the last of which held a \"day of rage\" on February 14, instigated by youths, and inspired by events in Egypt and Tunisia. Furthermore, at the time of writing, there was acute unrest in Libya as a result of mass civil unrest. 224 In the context of the Libyan crisis, many airlines adopted a cautious approach in planning their flights to Libya while others cancelled scheduled flights. 225 Stocks of European airlines rapidly declined and airlines such as British Airways and KLM cancelled their flight to Tripoli. 226 An inevitable corollary to intensifying violence in Libya, which is a large oil supplier to Europe, would be that airlines will be forced to charge higher fares. IATA observed that if the unrest were to continue in the various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, airlines would be forced 223 Tourism and transport combined forms the largest industry in the world. Air transport is a significant driver of tourism and visitors arriving by air directly support approximately 6.7 million jobs worldwide in the tourism industry with the foreign exchange they spend during their travels. Both the tourism industry and air transport industry depend on the policies of governments and the individual stability of States for their sustenance and development. The unrest wrought by mass protests in North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 seriously disrupted tourism and air transport. Tourism earned Egypt more than 11 billion dollars in the last fiscal year. In the third quarter of 2010, Egypt was receiving about 280 million US dollars a week from tourism.

Most, if not all countries affected by the civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa are tourist intensive and their income will suffer immensely. Many States issued travel advisories on Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. At the time of the unrest in early 2011, Tunisia was recovering from the devastating effects on its tourism industry brought about by the terrorist attacks of 2001 and 2002 when the country lost a substantial number of tourists from its traditional markets of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. The 500,000 German tourists lost in the process was a big blow to Tunisia's tourism. 230 With regard to Egypt, hotel capacity increased by approximately 7,000 rooms between 2009 and 2010 to a total of 220,000 hotel rooms. In December 2010 The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) increased its collaboration with Egypt in enhancing the country's tourist intake worked closely with Egypt in enhancing its capacity to measure the economic impact of tourism and provide consistent, internationally benchmarked tourism statistics. 231 With such an upsurge in tourism promotion, It is therefore heartening that tourism in Tunisia and Egypt, States that carried out a successful revolution in overthrowing their existing regimes, did not suffer for too long and recovered quickly. UNWTO has expressed its appreciation of proactive efforts by national authorities to restore confidence among tourists and by foreign governments to update travel advisories accordingly. Tourism is a significant contributor to both 227 Airlines set for losses as mid-east unrest continues, countries' economies and, as tourism returns to normalcy, overall economic recovery can be stimulated. 232 As the situation in both Egypt and Tunisian returns to normal, tourism stakeholders from the private and public sectors have reacted accordingly.

The last strategic objective, although relevant to the consequences of civil unrest on air transport by no means impels ICAO to intervene in the internal affairs of States or to ensure that amidst the clash of arms air transport carries on regardless. However, what it does is to draw a nexus between ICAO and the Convention on International Civil 232 http://www.traveldailynews.com/pages/show_page/41810-UNWTO-welcomes-signs-of-tourism-recuperation-in-Egypt-and-Tunisia. 233 http://www.aerosocietychannel.com/aerospace-insight/2011/02/shifting-sands/. 234 The International Civil Aviation Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was established by Article 44 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), signed at Chicago on 7 December 1944 (infra, note 12). The main objectives of ICAO are to develop the principles and techniques of international air navigation and to foster the planning and development of air transport. ICAO has 190 Contracting States. ICAO's Mission and Vision Statement is \"to achieve its mission of safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation through cooperation amongst its member States\". In December 2004, following a decision by the 35th Session of the ICAO Assembly, the Council of ICAO approved six Strategic Objectives for 2005-2010: They were: safety; security; environmental protection; efficiency; continuity; and rule of law. From 2011, ICAO's Strategic Objectives will be based on safety; security; environmental protection and the sustainable development of air transport. However, during the 37th Session of the Assembly, the Strategic Objectives were reduced to three: safety; security; environmental protection and sustainable development of air transport. Aviation (Chicago Convention) 235 which provides inter alia that an aim of ICAO is to foster the planning and development of international air transport so as to meet the needs of the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient and economical air transport. 236 The Chicago Convention requires States to keep their airports open to all airlines operating into and out of their territories and provide meteorological, radio and other information as well as facilities such as ground services. Of course, one might argue that Article 89 of the Chicago Convention enables Contracting States to have freedom of action irrespective of the provisions of the Convention in case of war, whether belligerents or neutrals. It also allows a State which has declared a state of national emergency (and notifies the ICAO Council of such) to have the same freedom of action notwithstanding the provisions of the Convention. Therefore, unless a State is at war (which the Convention does not define) 237 or has declared a state of national emergency, it would be bound by the provisions of the Convention.",

MANPADS have posed a serious threat to aviation security. On 5 January 1974, 220 soldiers and 200 police sealed off five square miles around Heathrow International airport in London after receiving reports that terrorists had smuggled SA-7s into Britain in the diplomatic pouches of Middle-Eastern embassies and were planning to shoot down an El Al airliner. 241 Another significant incident occurred on 13 January 1975 when an attempt by terrorists to shoot down an El Al plane with a missile was believed to have brought civil aviation to the brink of disaster. Two terrorists drove their car onto the apron at Orly airport, where they set up a rocket launcher and fired at an El Al airliner which was about to take off for New York with 136 passengers. The first round missed the target thanks to the pilot's evasive action and hit the fuselage of a Yugoslav DC-9 aeroplane waiting nearby to embark passengers for Zagreb.

The French authorities traced the attack to the PFLP Venezuelan terrorist, and leader of the PFLP group in Europe, Carlos. 242 It is also known that once again an El Al airliner had been deliberately chosen as a target by Gadafi in an attempt to avenge the loss of the Libyan airliner shot down by Israel over the Sinai Desert. 243 MANPADS are extremely effective weapons which are prolific in their availability worldwide. The significance of the abuse of MANPADS as a threat to civil aviation in the airport context is that MANPADS could be used in the vicinity of the perimeter of the airport or in the airport premises itself in view of the short range needed to hit an aircraft approaching an airport or departing from one. Introduced in the 1950s and originally meant to deter terror attacks from air to ground to be used by State authorities and other protection agencies, these weapons have got into the wrong hands and are being used against civil and military aviation. The surface to air MANPAD is a light weapon which offers very little warning before impact, and is often destructive and lethal. 244 They are cheap, easily carried, handled and concealed. It is claimed that there are at least 100,000 and possibly in excess of 500,000 systems in inventories around the world and several thousands of these are vulnerable to theft from State authorities. 245 It is also claimed that there is a 70% chance that a civil aircraft will be destroyed if hit by a MANPAD. 246 A study conducted and published in early 2005 by the Rand Corporation concludes that, based on the effects of the attacks of September 11 2001, it is plausible for air travel in the United States to fall by 15-20% after a successful MANPADS attack on a commercial airliner in the United States. 247 The international aviation community is aware that civil aircraft are particularly vulnerable to hand held ground to air missiles and that susceptibility avoidance techniques (calculated to avoid being hit) and vulnerability avoidance (survival after being hit) systems must be in place. This is particularly so since tracking the 242 Christopher Dobson and Ronald Payne, supra, p. 53. 243 . Ibid. 244 The lethality of the weapon can be reflected by the 340 MANPADS used by Afghan Mujahedeen rebels to successfully hit 269 soviet aircraft. See http://www.janes.com/security/internatio-nal_security/news/. 245 proliferation of MANPADS is difficult since any intelligence gathered on this particular threat is usually ex post facto, through the recovery of launchers or fragments from expended missiles. Contrary to popular belief, the MANPAD is considerably durable and can be used several years after inactivity, with recharged batteries.",

Over the past 35 years, significant developments have taken place in dangerous weapons systems creating more opportunities for terrorists. The ready acceptance of new modern technologies by the international community and our growing dependence on them have created many targets, such as nuclear and civil aircraft in flight. Similarly, developments in electronics and microelectronics, and the trend towards miniaturization and simplification have resulted in a greater availability of tactical weapons with longer ranges and more accuracy that are also simpler to operate. One of the most effective developments in individual weaponry is portable, precision-guided munitions (PGMs), which are lightweight and easy to operate. They can usually be carried and operated by a single person. The United States-made Stinger, the British-made Blowpipe and the Russian-made SA-7 missiles are examples of these smaller weapons. These are shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missiles that have infra-red, heatseeking sensors in the projectile that guide it to the heat emitted from an aircraft engine. It is known that more than 60 States possess SA-7 missiles and there is no doubt that most of them maintain strict security measures to prevent the outflow of the weapons. However, it has been alleged that some States, including Libya, have supplied PGMs to terrorist organizations. It is incontrovertible that in the hands of terrorists these missiles are not likely to be used against conventional targets such as tanks and military fighter aircraft. Of particular concern is the prospect of civilian airliners being shot at by SAMs and anti-tank rockets as they land at or take off from airports 248 Dr. Richard Clutterbuck subsumes the great threat of missile attacks:",

A missile's guidance system is such that the weapon has to be fired within a few degrees of the flight path if the infra-red guidance is to locate the target. Accordingly, a possible preventive measure would be to prevent terrorists from getting into a firing position with their missiles. However, it would be very difficult to cut off areas of up to 6 km wide that lie in the paths of aircraft as they land and take off. This measure is therefore impracticable if not impossible. 250 This difficulty can be overcome to an extent by patrolling the outer areas of airports in times of stringent security conditions might prevent such attacks. Even in times when no specific threat has been received, it is within the capacity of most States to monitor those strips of land from which a SAM could be launched and thus minimize the risk. At the same time, these security operations would deter terrorists from spending vital resources on buying SAMs given the limited possibilities for their use.",

However, the conscious awareness of the parties to the Convention, that in securing this peace, prudent economic and business principles must not be compromised, should not be forgotten.

Since the catastrophic events of 11 September 2012, we have seen stringent legal measures taken by the United States to attack terrorism, not just curb it. The famous phrase \"war on terror\" denotes pre-emptive and preventive strikes carried out through applicable provisions of legitimately adopted provisions of legislation. The earliest example is the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSAA) enacted by President Bush less than 2 months after the 9/11 attacks. Then, 2 months after the attacks, in November 2001, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) with a view to improving security and closing the security loopholes which existed on that fateful day in September 2001. The legislation paved the way for a huge federal body called the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) which was established within the Department of Transportation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 which followed effected a significant reorganization of the Federal Government.",

While concern was expressed regarding the impact of unpredictable security measures on passenger confidence in aviation security, many Panel members supported implementation of the concept because of its value as a deterrent. It was suggested that States adopt an approach providing for a baseline regime, but with the addition of unpredictable measures, thus achieving a balance between certainty and unpredictability. With regard to an amendment to Annex 17 in this regard, the need for introducing unpredictability into the aviation security regime was considered, and it was agreed that unpredictability should be promoted in principle but not prescribed. The Panel suggested that if an Annex 17 specification related to unpredictability were to be developed, it would be necessary to ensure that the introduction of this concept by States does not diminish the level of security or result in delays for passengers. Further, the Panel noted that appropriate guidance material may be required to address the potential negative impact of introducing the concept of unpredictability, and proposed the development of guidance material related to unpredictability prior to the introduction of an amendment to Annex 17.",

            "text": "The leakage of dangerous pathogens 262 from laboratories also presents an ominous analogy to the aviation sector in that the same could well occur in the carriage of such dangerous goods by air. Although past instances of the escape of dangerous pathogens are small in number, nonetheless their occurrence and the threat posed to the wellbeing of humanity cannot be underestimated. In 2002 when Anthrax spores escaped from two military laboratories in the United States, the authorities agreed that the leakage was due to a security lapse. 263 In 2003 a string of such leakages occurred in Asia, this time of the SARS virus. 264 Offences Under the Convention The first offence identified by the Convention relates to any person committing an offence if that person unlawfully and intentionally performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft. 265 This offence has three salient elements: the offence has to be committed by a person \"on board\" 266 an aircraft; the aircraft has to be \"in flight\"; and the act perpetrated should endanger the safety of the aircraft. According to the Convention, the aircraft is considered to be in flight at any time from the moment when all its external doors are closed following embarkation until the moment when any such door is opened for disembarkation; in the case of a forced landing, the flight shall be deemed to continue until the competent authorities take over the responsibility for the aircraft and for persons and property on board. 267 262 Pathogens are microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) or recombinant microorganisms (hybrid or mutant) that are known or are reasonably expected to cause infectious disease in humans or animals. 263 An year earlier, a covert event occurred in October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent through the mail exposing persons in the eastern USA to contaminated mail resulting in deaths, illnesses and identified exposures to Anthrax. Overt, announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred, have taken place in the United States, although most of these were determined to have been hoaxes, that is, there were no true exposures to infectious agents. 264 The leakages occurred in China, Taiwan and Singapore. See Air-Tight Security, Intersec, June 2007 33-35 at 34. 265 Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation, done at Beijing on 10 September 2010, Article 1. (a). 266 The offender has to be physically inside the aircraft. This offence therefore does not ex facie apply to an offence committed outside the aircraft. The Convention does not define \"on board\". However, it must be noted that the term \"on board\" has been judicially defined in absolute terms to mean that as long as a person is physically in the aircraft, it matters not whether the flight had been terminated or not. See Herman v. Trans World Airlines, 330 N.Y.S.D. 2nd 829 (Sup.Ct. 1972) where the Court held that although the aircraft in which the passenger was travelling had been hijacked and flown to the desert, and the passenger was kept in the aircraft for several days, he was nonetheless considered to have been on board, irrespective of whether the purpose of the flight had been fulfilled or not. See also Pfug v. Egyptair, 961F. 2d. 26 ( 2nd Cir.1992) . 267 Supra, note 269, Article 2 (a). The next consideration within this specific offence is that the act perpetrated should endanger the safety of the aircraft. This seemingly excludes acts of air rage which in many instances only affect the safety of the person against whom the offence is committed. By restricting the offence to safety of the aircraft in flight, the Convention has ensured that every offence under this provision must essentially endanger the safety of the aircraft in which the offence is committed. Undoubtedly the ultimate arbiters of the Convention, which were the ICAO member States, had a reason for adopting this approach and it would be interesting to learn of the rationale of this approach, particularly in the context of a recommendation offered by the ICAO Aviation Security Panel at its 21st Meeting held from 22 to 26 March 2010, where the Panel suggested that the Secretariat Study Group on Unruly Passengers be reconvened in order to study the issue of unruly passengers and consider whether the existing international legal regime should be re-examined.",

It provides that an offence is committed when a person destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. 274 This undoubtedly refers, inter alia to cyber terrorism, but links the offence exclusively to the safety of aircraft in flight. If therefore as a result of an act of cyber terrorism, a taxiing aircraft collides with an aircraft which has opened its doors for disembarkation but the passengers are still on board awaiting disembarkation, that act would not be considered an offence in terms of the passengers in the process of disembarkation.

Furthermore, this provision raises an important issue. One could argue that the exclusivity of \"safety in flight\" may unduly restrict the scope of this provision. For instance, if a phony telephone call claims that there would be a bomb on board a flight that would be operated the next day, and the air operator cancels that flight incurring an economic loss, there would be no offence as the aircraft in question was not \"in flight\" as defined in the Convention. This consideration may be particularly relevant in the context of the title of the Treaty which is \"Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation\" which obviously does not restrict itself to safety or security issues. Another consideration is that if such a communication were to come just as the doors of an arriving aircraft are opened for disembarkation and passengers are injured or killed in a stampeded, this provision would not apply.",

Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food.

Until recently in the United States of America, most biological defence strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than looking after ordinary people in cities. In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the co director of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \"non-traditional\" (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nation-wide.",

It is quite curious that an attack against an airport, to be classified under this Convention has to endanger safety at the airport and does not include safety of the airport.

The attack caused about 751 people to get sick (there were no fatalities). This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the twentieth century. In September and October of 2001, several cases of anthrax broke out in the United States which were reportedly caused deliberately. This was a well-publicized act of bioterrorism. It motivated efforts to define biodefense and biosecurity. 288 In 1915 and 1916, Dr Anton Dilger, a German-American physician used cultures of anthrax and glanders with the intention of committing biological sabotage on behalf of the German government. Other German agents are known to have undertaken similar sabotage efforts during World War I in Norway, Spain, Romania and Argentina. 289 Beijing Convention, supra, Article 1.2. provision seems to imply that any wanton damage to an airport or its infrastructure; insofar as it does not affect the safety of persons would not be an offence.",

Each State Party may also establish its jurisdiction over any such offence when the offence is committed against a national of that State; or when the offence is committed by a stateless person whose habitual residence is in the territory of that State. 296 With regard to extradition of offenders, the Convention obligates (again with the word \"shall\") the State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is found if it does not extradite that person, without exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory, to submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities are required to take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State. 297 It is incontrovertible that, given the various innovative terrorist acts perpetrated against civil aviation, the Beijing Treaty of 2010 is a proactive and timely initiative of both ICAO and the international civil aviation community. In this regard it must be noted that this treaty was adopted, as are other treaties, by State Parties to the Beijing Conference and ICAO was the initiator and facilitator of the Conference.

Protocol No. 7 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 302 provides that an alien lawfully resident in the territory of a State shall not be expelled therefrom except in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law and shall be allowed: (a) to submit reasons against his expulsion, (b) to have his case reviewed, and (c) to be represented before the competent authority or a person or persons designated by that authority. 303 An alien may be expelled before the exercise of his rights, when such expulsion is necessary in the interests of public order or is grounded on reasons of national security. 304 Furthermore, Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 305 provides that an alien lawfully in the territory of a State Party may be expelled therefrom only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law and shall, except where compelling reasons of national security otherwise require, be allowed to submit the reasons against his expulsion and to have his case reviewed by, and be represented before the competent authority or a person or persons especially designated by the competent authority. 306 The Third Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War of 1949 307 stipulates that, in the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, that persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end the Convention prohibits: violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; taking of hostages; outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment; the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. The Convention also provides that the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. It also provides that an impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. In the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld 308 the decision of the Supreme Court suggests that all activities carried out in the \"war on terror\" of the United States must pass the minimum standards set out in the Convention. 309 The above notwithstanding, there are at least three controversial cases where the rendition of the victims by air have been questionable. 310 This brings to bear two areas of concern: false arrest and imprisonment; and the significance of the role of air transport and its meaning and purpose in the backdrop of circumstances of war.",

Ohio, 313 which arose from an arrest stemming from a policeman becoming suspicious of two men when one of them walked up the street, peered into a store, walked on, started back, looked into the same store, and then conferred with his companion. The other suspect repeated this ritual, and between them the two men went through this performance about a dozen times before following a third man up the street. The officer, thinking they were preparing to commit a misdemeanour and might therefore be armed, confronted the men, asked their names and patted them down, thereby discovering pistols the plaintiff and his companion. In affirming Terry's conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, the Supreme Court concluded that where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may ensue and that the person with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him. Physical detention is an essential ingredient for grounding an action in false imprisonment. Thus if a person agrees to go to a police station voluntarily, he has not been arrested even though the person taking him would have arrested him on refusal to go. 314 The law provides that where an arresting officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an arrestable offence has been committed, he may arrest without a warrant anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of that offence. 315 The offence of false imprisonment is one of \"basic intent\" and despite the paucity of authority as to whether the element of mens rea is necessary to constitute the offence of false imprisonment, 316 at least one decision 317 has recognized the requirement.",

While this provision holds incontrovertible the fact that a person who is arrested has to be informed of the grounds for his arrest, it dispenses with the exclusive need to inform the person at the time of arrest. 320 In the more recent case of Murray v. Ministry of Defence 321 the plaintiff sued the Crown for false imprisonment on the ground that she had been detained and questioned by members of the armed forces for 30 min before they indicated to her that she was under arrest. She claimed that her arrest took place only when she was informed that she was under arrest and that the preceding detention was therefore unlawful. The House of Lords at appeal held that where a person was detained or restrained by a police officer and knew that he was being detained or restrained, such detention amounted to an arrest even though no formal words of arrest were spoken by the officer. Since the plaintiff had been under restraint from the moment she was identified, and must have realised that she was under restraint, she was deemed to have been under arrest from that moment, notwithstanding that the arrest took place formally, a half hour later.",

In its Preamble, the Convention enunciates a message of peace through aviation. It makes mention of the future development of international civil aviation being able to help preserve friendship and understanding among the nations of the world, while its abuse (i.e. abuse of future development of international civil aviation) can become a threat to \"the general security\". By \"general security\" the Chicago Conference meant the prevention of threats to peace.

In Resolution A20-2 (Acts of Unlawful Interference with Civil Aviation) the Assembly reiterated its confidence that the development of international civil aviation can be an effective tool in bringing about friendship and understanding among the peoples of the world.",

However, in some cases of extraordinary rendition, unfortunately, the converse has happened and in the instances already mentioned the attendant circumstances have even caused strife among nations. Arguably, the most dangerous risk of arrest of an innocent airline passenger suspected of terrorist activity would arise from profiling. It is an incontrovertible fact that profiling is a useful tool in the pursuit of the science of criminology. Profiling is also a key instrument in a sociological context and therefore remains a sustained social science constructed through a contrived process of accumulation of single assumptions and propositions that flow to an eventual empirical conclusion. However, profiling raises well reasoned latent fears when based on a racial platform. Jonathan Turley, Professor of Constitutional Law at George Washington University, in his testimony before a United States House of Representatives Committee on Airport Security regarding the use of racial profiling to identify potentially dangerous travellers observed: [R] acial profiling is to the science of profiling as forced confessions are to the art of interrogation. Like forced confessions, racial profiling achieves only the appearance of effective police work. Racial profiling uses the concept of profiling to shield or obscure a racist and unscientific bias against a particular class or group. It is the antithesis of profiling in that it elevates stereotypes over statistics in law enforcement. 331 330 See Repertory Guide to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Second Edition, 1977, Preamble -1.This subject was also addressed at a later session of the Assembly when the Assembly, at its 18th Session adopted Resolution A18-4 (Measures to be taken in pursuance of Resolutions 2555 and 2704 of the United Nations General Assembly in Relation to South Africa). 331 Turley (2002) .",

This by no means implies that racial profiling is a desirable practice. On the contrary, it is a demeaning experience to the person subjected to the process and a de facto travel restriction and barrier.

Article 3 (a) of the Chicago Convention provides that the Convention will be applicable only to civil aircraft and not to state aircraft. It is an inclusionary provision which identifies military, customs and police service aircraft as being included in an undisclosed list of state aircraft. The Convention contradicts itself in Article 3 (c), where it says that no state aircraft of a contracting State shall fly over the territory of another State or land thereon without authorization by special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms thereof. The question arises as to how an international treaty, which on the one hand prescribes that it applies only to civil aircraft, turns around and prescribes a rule for state aircraft. Article 3 (c) effectively precludes relief flights over the territory of a State by state aircraft if the State flown over or landed upon does not give authorization for the aircraft to do so. Milde cites several instances of different types of aircraft being used in rendition flights 334 and concludes that a State aircraft may be identified by the design of the aircraft and its technical characteristics; registration marks; ownership; and type of operation. 335 The distinction between civil and state aircraft is unclear as the Chicago Convention does not go to any length in defining or specifying as to how the two categories have to be distinguished.

In order to effectively implement the proposals of the Resolution, Contracting States were requested to initiate and improve the coordination between their civil and military air traffic services and the ICAO Council was required to ensure that the matter of civil and military coordination in the use of airspace is included, when appropriate, in the agenda of divisional and regional meetings. 336 The ICAO Assembly, at its 36th Session (Montreal, 18-27 September, 2007) adopted Resolution A36-13 (Consolidated statement of continuing ICAO policies and associated practices related specifically to air navigation), Appendix O of which reiterates for the most part the text of Appendix O of Resolution A21-21, adding that the ICAO Council should endeavour to support States in the establishment of civil/military agreements by providing advice and guidance. 337 One of the fundamental issues in the determination of aircraft category under Article 3 of the Chicago Convention is the use of civil aircraft in some instances for military purposes. 338 In emergency situations, States may acquire or in any other manner use civil aircraft for the transport of military personnel or goods meant for official use. In such circumstances any determination of the category of the aircraft concerned must be made taking into account all pertinent circumstances of the flight. Perhaps the most fundamental difference between the operation of civil and military aircraft lay in the fact that, although they were expected to share the same 336 It will be recalled that the ICAO Council, at the Sixth Meeting of its 37th Session, held on 15 May 1959, noted the need for the Secretary General to pursue as effectively as possible the problem of accommodation of civil and military traffic in the available airspace. The efforts of the Secretary General were primarily meant to focus on the prevention of mid air collisions by the proper coordination of civil and military air traffic. 337 See Assembly Resolutions in Force (as of 28 September 2007) Doc. 9902, at II-I7 to See Abeyratne (1997) . skies, the procedures by which they did this varied greatly. Civil aircraft depended entirely on predetermined flight paths and codes of commercial conduct which varied depending on aircraft type and types of traffic carried, whereas military aircraft operated in line with the exigency of a situation and were not necessarily always guided by predetermined flight paths. This dichotomy led to the adoption of Resolution A10-19 by the Tenth Session of the ICAO Assembly in 1956. The Assembly Resolution, while recognizing that the skies (airspace) as well as many other facilities and services are commonly shared between civil and military aviation, focused on ICAO's mandate to promote safety of flight 339 and reinforced the thrust of Article 3(d) of the Chicago Convention. The Resolution called for all Contracting States to co-ordinate between their various aeronautical activities in order that the common use of airspace inter alia be so arranged that safety, regularity and efficiency of international civil air navigation be safeguarded.",

Between 1919 and 1922, the relationship between civil and military aviation was debated at length by three international committees of air experts which met, respectively, in Paris, Geneva and Washington. They concluded independently that no means could be devised to prevent the conversion of civil aviation to military purposes, which would not at the same time prejudice the 339 As per Article 44 of the Chicago Convention. 340 In the earliest days of this century, jurists divided aircraft into two categories, public and private, with differing applicable legal regimes. The majority of European powers which replied to a questionnaire submitted by the French Government in 1909 agreed that public and private aircraft should be distinguished. The first diplomatic conference on air navigation, which met in Paris in 1910, defined public aircraft as \"aircraft employed in the service of a contracting State, and placed under the orders of a duly commissioned official of that State.\" More particularly, a very specific regime to govern military aircraft was outlined. The Conference did not formally adopt a convention, but provisions drafted heavily influenced the Paris Convention of 1919. development of civil aviation. In 1920, the Supreme War Council of the Paris Peace Conference asked one of these committees, the Aeronautical Advisory Commission to the Peace Conference, which had given its opinion in 1919, to draw up rules to distinguish between civil aviation and the military and naval aviation forbidden by the Peace Treaties. The Commission, referring to its 1919 report, replied that the task was impossible. The Supreme Council insisted that the rules be drawn up; after several months of debates, the Commission submitted what is known as \"The Nine Rules\" of 1922, for differentiating between military and civil aircraft. The distinction was based on technical criteria such as engine size, speed, \"useful load\" etc. It soon became clear that many civil aircraft fulfilled these criteria and the Rules were later abandoned.",

Air Navigation principles were allocated to Subcommittee 2 of Committee I. The United States draft was used as the primary basis for discussion in Subcommittee 2.

Article 2 specifically provides that the Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies, but by virtue of the Additional Protocol, Parties may make a declaration at the time of ratification or accession that Article 2 (1) shall not apply to international carriage performed directly by the State. The Hague Protocol of 1955 to amend this Convention, in Article XXVI allows a State to declare that the Convention as amended by the Protocol shall not apply to the carriage of persons, cargo and baggage for its military authorities on aircraft, registered in that State, the whole capacity of which has been reserved by or on behalf of such authorities. Identical provisions are contained, mutatis mutandis, in the Guatemala City Protocol of 1971 (Article XXIII) the 1975 Additional Protocol No. 2 (Montreal), the 1975 Additional Protocol No. 3 (Montreal) and in Montreal Protocol No. 4 of 1975.

The question whether a particular insurance coverage is rendered invalid in such situations is primarily a private law matter of the construction and interpretation of the insurance contract. Unless the contract has an exclusion clause which specifically makes reference to the classification in Article 3 of the Chicago Convention (e.g. loss of coverage where the operation is of a state (or civil) aircraft as defined in the Chicago Convention), where the Convention will have no bearing on the contract, and the issue of the loss of insurance coverage becomes moot, the Chicago Convention's application to the insurance contract would prevail. Frequently, the policy will exclude usage of the aircraft for any purpose other than those stated\" in a Schedule; among the exclusions would be any use involving abnormal hazards. Nearly every aviation hull and liability policy now excludes losses due to war, invasion, hostilities, rebellion. etc., although insurance to cover such losses can usually be obtained by the payment of a higher premium. However, the instances mentioned do not require a determination of whether the aircraft is considered to be state or civil under the Chicago Convention.",

Would civil or military investigative and judicial processes be applied, for example. in the case of an accident? The answer would depend largely on the domestic laws of the State concerned. The fundamental principle is stated in Article 1 of the Convention: every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. Furthermore, subject to the provisions of the Convention, the laws and regulations of a contracting State relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or the operation and navigation of such aircraft within its territory, shall be complied with by (civil) aircraft of other contracting States, upon entering or departing from or while in the territory of that A fortiori, state aircraft are also subject to the laws of the subjacent State.",

They can voluntarily (through their legislation) so apply' these provisions. Sometimes, the legislation specifies a different procedure in relation to military aircraft only; all other aircraft, including those used in customs or police services, are treated as civilian in this regard. In the case of other incidents, where for example the requisite over-flight permission has not been obtained by a state aircraft, which is then forced to land and charges brought against the crew, again the answer would depend on the domestic laws of the over-flown State and the factual circumstances. It is impossible to give a definitive answer in a vacuum. but it is the view of the Secretariat that the classification of an aircraft as \"state\" aircraft under the Convention does not necessarily mean that military laws and procedures of a State would apply to that aircraft or its crew. The current or any different classification of aircraft under the Convention would not be determinative whether a particular State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, would make that aircraft and/or its crew subject to civil or military laws and regulations. As a matter of practice States usually apply military rules and processes to military aircraft and personnel only. Paragraph 2.1.3 above shows that at the international level, attempts to arrive at a common, acceptable definition of military aircraft have met with a singular lack of success.",

The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (No. I) applies to \"persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civil members of military aircraft crews . . . provided they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany\" and to \". . . the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict . . .\" The same provisions are found in Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of the Armed Forces at Sea (No. 2) and the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (No. 3). The Geneva Conventions, and in particular the provisions quoted above, do not link their own scopes of applicability to the determination under the Chicago Convention of the status of an aircraft. The Conventions of 1949 refer to civil and military aircraft, but not to these terms as \"defined\" under Chicago. Consequently, the provisions of the Chicago Convention does not, and cannot, determine whether and to what extent the flight crew of an aircraft is given protection by these Conventions.",
