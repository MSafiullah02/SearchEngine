Significant associations with HIV seropositivity were found with the number of lifetime partners, positive treponemal serology, and evidence of previous infection with herpes simplex virus. However the major and unique finding was the strong and independent association between proctitis diagnosed by histologic criteria and seropositivity for HIV. Whether this is cause or effect awaits further elucidation.",

A self-administered questionnaire was given to each subject to record past medical and STD history and details of sexual practices. For this project, we analyzed the data on 140 ofthe original 200 enrolled in a study on STD and enteric infections in homosexual men, who had completed questionnaires, undergone rectal biopsies, and turned in the full complement of fecal specimens.

These results are consistent with those of other investigations [1] [2] [3] 5] .

            "text": "Whether recurrent rectal inflammation as described preceded the acquisition of HIV is unclear, since the study design was cross-sectional in nature. Conventional explanations for the association between genital ulcer disease and acquisition of HI V usually rely on disruption of the mucosal integrity of the genital (or gastrointestinal) tract [11, 12] . Although these explanations appear possible in this group, as conditions associated with a disruption of epithelial integrity (presence of anal warts and rectal HSV) were significantly associated with the detection of histologic features of proctitis, proctitis alone and not these factors was significantly associated with HIV antibody status. In fact, on the basis of clinical and histologic features, there was no mucosal ulceration in any patient in this group. It is possible that not all cases of transmission of HIV are reliant on mucosal ulceration. For example, the presence of inflammatory cells so closely adjacent to infectious virus may be relevant, since it is known that activated lymphocytes are more susceptible to infection [13] , and in recurrent herpes, an inflammatory infiltrate of activated CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages is found subjacent to the epithelium [14] . The assay we used, which detected antibody to both HSV-l and HSV-2, should in future be replaced by a specific HSV-2 antibody assay, as others have found significant associations between prior HSV-2 infection and acquisition ofHI V [5] . As enteric organisms (other than HSV-2) did not appear to be significantly associated with histologically diagnosed proctitis, other mechanisms contributing to inflammatory changes may need to be investigated. For example, granulomas around foreign body debris were occasionally noted in the histologic sections of biopsies taken from the distal rectum (unpublished data) and may represent localized reactions to oilbased lubricants commonly used by homosexual men during anal intercourse. An alternative explanation for our results could be that the presence of HIV directly or indirectly modified the inflammatory response in the rectal mucosa. We were unable to exclude direct infection of the rectal mucosal cells with HIV; in other studies, this has occasionally been demonstrated in bowel biopsies by molecular techniques [15] . Although the gastrointestinal tract appears to be a major target organ late in HIV infection, as indicated by tumors, opportunistic infections, and malabsorption, much remains to be learned about the gastrointestinal mucosal response to HIV. Indeed, the mucosal immune response to bowel infections in general has not yet been clarified.",
