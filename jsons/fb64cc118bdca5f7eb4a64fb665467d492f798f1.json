            "text": "The Golgi apparatus has two main roles. The first of these is the modification of newly synthesized proteins and lipids as they pass through the organelle. The second is to serve as a major sorting point in the secretory pathway, with proteins and lipids being selectively targeted to several different organelles. These two functions are performed by a population of Golgi resident proteins. The modification enzymes of the Golgi include the glycosidases and glycosyltransferases responsible for synthesizing the huge diversity of complex oligosaccharides that are attached to both glycoproteins, on N-lipked and O-linked glycan branches, and glycolipids. Indeed, the Golgi is the site of synthesis of many sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, and glucosylceramide, the precursor of many other glycolipids. Other Golgi enzymes sulfate tyrosines, attach palmitoyl groups and proteolytically cleave specific proteins. These enzymes have been most extensively characterized in mammalian cells, and in other organisms further enzymes must be present, such as those responsible for the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides in plants and fungi, and scales in algae.",

            "text": "Once the Golgi enzymes have completed their actions, the resulting modified proteins and lipids are transported to their final locations, and it is this process that requires the second class of Golgi residents. These Golgi-localized sorting proteins recruit vesicle coats, collect particular sets of proteins and lipids into transport vesicles and then pinch off and target these vesicles to their correct destination. Finally, the Golgi itself must be sorted within the cell, with motors and structural components attached to maintain its intracellular location, which, in mammalian cells, is usually around the microtubule-organizing centre. The population of resident enzymes and sorting components must be maintained despite the large flow of proteins and lipids through the Golgi to other organelles in the cell. Therefore, mechanisms must exist to distinguish between Golgi residents and Golgi transients so that the two populations of proteins are sorted differently. The situation is complicated by the fact that the Golgi consists of several discrete cisternae, and individual Golgi residents are often found restricted to a subset of these. Vesicular trafficking components such as t-SNARES are restricted to one end of the Golgi or the other, and the modification enzymes are not distributed evenly between the cisternae but rather are usually found in the order in which they act on substrates. For the enzymes, this intra-Golgi segregation is often not precise, with proteins found overlapping and spread over two or more cisternae in a graded fashion, which itself can vary between cell types for a given protein'. Nonetheless, there must be mechanisms to account for the different distributions of particular proteins between the cisternae.",

For several of these residents, it has been possible to identify regions that are crucial for specifying a Golgi localization.

This latter type of mechanism applies to the localization signals in the cytoplasmic tails of TGN proteins. These proteins recycle continuously through the cell surface or endosomes, and the signal specifies return of the protein to the TGN7s9. In mammalian cells, this TGN retrieval signal initially directs endocytosis from the cell surface and then somewhere in the endosomal system causes the protein to be diverted away from the normal endocytic fates of lysosomal delivery or recycling back to the cell surface and instead directs passage into vesicles destined for the TGN. The vesicle coats, and other machinery, involved in this endosome-to-TGN step have yet to be identified, but further understanding of this pathway might well derive from the recent identification of a set of genes that are required for this step in yeastlO,ll.

This model arose initially from work on a viral Golgi protein that forms homo-oligomers14 and was extended by the observation that two enzymes of the medial Golgi, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (NAGT I) and mannosidase II, are tightly associated in viv@. It has also been suggested that the immobility of these enzyme oligomers could be augmented by their binding to a putative Golgi matrix located between the cisternaer6. The lipid-sorting model envisages that the bilayer of the Golgi cisternae is not homogeneous but contains distinct lipid domains between which the Golgi enzymes partition differentially\". This idea arose from the fact that Golgi TMDs do not contain any obvious distinguishing sequence motif, and attempts to find key residues by mutagenesis have not been successful. Instead, the TMDs of mammalian Golgi enzymes are on average five residues shorter than those of plasma membrane proteins and contain more of the bulky residue phenylalaninel','*. A similar difference is also observed for proteins of the yeast secretory pathway (S. Munro, unpublished) . The relevance of this difference in TMD length to retention is supported by mutagenesis studies, which have shown that lengthening the TMD of sialyltransferase or galactosyltransferase results in reduced retention and that a synthetic TMD of 17 leucines gives Golgi retention, whereas one of 23 leucines does not19-21. Not all mutagenesis studies have been interpreted as being consistent with TMD length being the key signal for retention2,22. The localization of different Golgi enzymes to different cistemae within the stack could well reflect a role for further sorting signals in addition to TMD length (see below). However, it is important to stress that results with chimeric membrane proteins must always be interpreted with caution as placing a TMD from a multimeric protein in a heterologous context could expose hydrophilic residues normally buried in the intact protein.",

The bilayer of the ER consists mainly of phospholipids, whereas the plasma membrane is rich in sphingolipids and sterols, which order and thicken the bilayeti3, thereby increasing its impermeability. Thus, a change in bilayer thickness is likely to occur in the Golgi apparatus where sphingolipids are synthesized. Indeed, it has been proposed that the multicisternal nature of the Golgi could reflect the fact that its original function is to sort these lipids 17. To account for Golgi enzyme retention, the lipid-sorting model proposes that either the vesicles leaving the TGN would bud from thicker sphingolipid/sterol-rich domains or the process of budding would specifically form such domains, which would exclude the shorter TMDs of the Golgi enzymes. The relative contributions of sterols and sphingolipids to this thickening might vary between species. Cholesterol is abundant in mammalian plasma membranes, but, in insects and nematodes, which are sterol auxotrophs and hence have less sterol, the sphingolipids have longer acyl chains than those of mammalian cells24,25.",

However, two recent sets of observations are more consistent with the lipid-based model. First, the association between NAGT I and mannosidase II mentioned above has been shown to be mediated by the lumenal domains of these proteins rather than the TMDs that are responsible for their retention21,26. This raises the possibility that this interaction does not reflect a general and broad association of all the enzymes in a particular compartment but, rather, reflects a specific association to form a multi-enzyme complex. Indeed, two such multienzyme complexes of Golgi transferases have recently been found in the cis Golgi of yeast U. Jungmann and S. Munro, EMBO I. (in press)]. Second, the mobility of Golgi enzymes within the bilayer of living cells has recently been examined by fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to Golgi proteins and following the diffusion of these Go&i-retained chimeras after photobleaching of living cells2'. This revealed that both medial and tram enzymes are highly mobile, with diffusion coefficients similar to the most mobile proteins of the plasma membrane, such as rhodopsin or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. However, it should be noted that the extent of protein oligomerization is predicted to have only a small effect on the lateral mobility of membrane proteins [as the size of a complex increases, the diffusion coefficient (0) is predicted to fall in proportion to the log of the radius of the complexz8]. Thus, while these GFP results are difficult to reconcile with very large complexes, or with the transferases being anchored to an intracisternal matrix, they cannot exclude smaller oligomers of a few hundred proteins.",

Although this has been studied most extensively in ER-to-Golgi transport, it is already well established that signals on proteins leaving the TGN can target them to lysosomes and to the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized cells. It seems likely that there will also be signals acting to concentrate proteins into exocytic vesicles in nonpolarized cellsz9.

Although this is clearly relevant to enzymes such as sialyltransferases in the TGN, it is less clear what Golgi retention involves for those enzymes found in earlier cisternae of the stack. This is because at present it is not certain how secreted proteins move forward through the Golgi -that is, what is the process that the Golgi enzymes have to be prevented from following. The debate about whether proteins move from cis to trans by cisternal maturation or by vesicles is covered elsewhere in this issue, but, until it is resolved, any model for medial Golgi enzyme sorting has to be proposed in two versions, depending on how transport works. If there is actually forward vesicular transport between cisternae, then localization of medial enzymes could be achieved either by retention mechanisms preventing the proteins ever entering retrograde or anterograde vesicles, or by the proteins being continuously retrieved from later cisternae. However, if proteins move from medial to trans by maturation, then retention mechanisms cannot apply, and medial enzymes must enter retrograde vesicles to maintain their distribution. In yeast, there is evidence for an early Golgi enzyme Ochlp cycling rapidly through a later compartment 30. Although this observation is compatible with either model of Golgi transport, it does emphasize the need to consider how Golgi localization signals could act to direct recruitment into retrograde vesicles. The localization signal in Ochlp has not been mapped, but, for other medial enzymes from yeast and mammals, the TMDs have a role in Golgi targeting 31,32. Sorting by TMDs into retrograde vesicles could be lipid based if retrograde vesicles select thinner, phospholipid-rich, membrane. Indeed, in electron-micrographs, the bilayer of COPI-coated vesicles appears thinner than that of the cisternae they are budding from33. Of course, the TMD length need not be the only factor mediating retrograde recycling, and in both yeast and mammalian cells the lumenal domain of medial enzymes contributes to their retention31s32. This might reflect a requirement for recruitment into a multi-enzyme complex, with more TMDs perhaps allowing better partitioning between lipid domains. Alternatively, there could be specific retrograde receptors to recycle the medial enzymes, recognizing their lumenal domains, or even their TMDs, analogous to the proposed function of Rerlp in mediating the retrieval of some ER resi-dents34. There is certainly no shortage of Golgi membrane proteins for which functions have yet to be found -for example, MG160, a protein of repeated domain structure conserved between mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans35.",

The best evidence is for proteins involved in trafficking between the ER and Golgi. The putative yeast cargo receptor Emp47p 14 maintains a predominantly cis Golgi distribution by being continuously incorporated into COPI-coated retrograde vesicles and recycled to the ER, where it is then presumably efficiently recruited into vesicles returning to the cis Golgi36. Two other receptors in this circuit, the KDEL receptor Erd2p and the Secl2p receptor Rerlp, have a cis Golgi distribution in both mammalian cells and yeast and also recycle continuously through the ER34,37.

Obviously, vesicular coat components must be transiently recruited to Golgi membranes, and many of the proteins involved in this recruitment, such as the ARFl GTPase and its regulatory proteins, are also peripherally attached to the G~lgi~~,~~. In addition, for several families of signal-transduction proteins, at least one isoform is on the Golgi. The precise role of these signalling proteins on the Golgi is unclear, but presumably they are either responsible for regulating events in the Golgi itself or are stored on the Golgi for release to sites elsewhere in the cell. Furthermore, there are isoforms of spectrin and ankyrin proposed to be involved in tethering the Golgi to microtubules, and a family of large coiled-coil proteins of unknown function that often appear as Golgi autoantigens in autoimmune responses48,4v. All of these peripheral proteins must distinguish the membranes of the Golgi from those of other organelles. How this is achieved is an intriguing question, especially since these other organelles all appear to have analogous, but distinct, populations of 'hangers-on'. Obviously, for some proteins, the answer could simply be that they bind specifically to the cytoplasmic tail of a Go&i-localized membrane protein. However, it is also possible that the proteins are recognizing a more general feature of Golgi membranes. For some peripheral Golgi proteins, it has been possible to identify regions that are necessary and sufficient for localization. For three such proteins, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, glutamate decarboxylase and SCGlO, this region comprises the first 30-35 N-terminal residuessss2. None of these three regions are related by sequence, but all three are fatty acylated, and this acylation appears to contribute to membrane association. However, acylation is also found on proteins attached to many other membranes, and so the reason for the Golgi specificity of these associations is unclear. A similar situation isseen with protein kinase CE, where the zinc-finger domain is sufficient for Golgi target-ings3. Although a related motif is also found in the Go&i-associated ARF GAPs4', it is also found in many proteins, including all other protein kinases C, that are targeted to other membranes. At present, it is unclear what protein or lipid receptors these targeting domains are recognizing on Golgi membranes and indeed if any of them share a common receptor. One clue is given by the observation that many peripherally associated proteins, including the vesicle coats, rapidly dissociate when the GTP loading of ARF is inhibited with the drug brefeldin A. This suggests that these proteins recognize either ARF itself, a product of an enzyme activated by ARF, or another protein whose association is mediated in these ways.",
