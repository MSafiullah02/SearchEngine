Infectious diseases are one of the most common worldwide causes of death and are the leading cause of disease burden as assessed by disability-adjusted-life-years by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. The growing number of antimicrobial resistant bacteria is of increasing concern, prompting the WHO in 2014 to release a report on the global burden of antimicrobial resistance, with high levels of resistance present in common pathogens that cause health-care and community-acquired infections [2]. One way of potentially combating resistant organisms is to gain a better understanding of the innate immune host pathways involved in their clearance, with the aim of potentially modulating signaling activation to improve clearance and reduce host damage.",

            "text": "The interferons are a family of cytokines that perform a variety of immune and cellular functions. The type I interferon (IFN) family of cytokines consists of 13 IFN\u03b1 subtypes, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b5, and IFN\u03c9 and the type II IFN family is represented by IFN\u03b3. Initially identified as IL29, IL28A and IL28B, the type III IFN family (IFN\u03bb), consisting of IFNL1 (IL-29), IFNL2 (IL-28A), IFNL3 (IL-28B) was discovered in 2003 by Sheppard and Kotenko [3], [4]. More recently, the type III IFN family expanded when IFNL4 was identified in 2013 through genetic studies of patients infected with hepatitis C virus [5]. Originally thought to be a pseudogene, it became clear that a significant percentage of the human population has a functional IFNL4 gene, while a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the majority of the population results in a frameshift mutation inhibiting IFNL4 production [6]. There is high sequence identity between the type III interferon family members, 96% between IL-28A and IL-28B, and approximately 81% with IL-29 and IL-28A/B [3], [4]. Interestingly, the type III IFN family is more closely related to IL-10 as opposed to either type I or type II IFNs, which explains why they were initially named as being part of the interleukin family [7]. The genes of the IFN lambda family contain four introns, like IL-10, while the type I IFN genes do not contain any introns [8]. The type III IFNs have 12 and 17% amino acid similarity with IL-10 and type I IFN families respectively.",

Type I and III IFN signaling has traditionally been associated with viral infection but it is now appreciated that bacteria and their products are also able to activate this pathway. Many bacterial pathogens, both intra- and extracellular are able to induce a type I IFN response via recognition of PAMPs and messengers such as DNA, RNA, peptidoglycan, LPS and cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) [12], [13], [14]. TLR2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, NOD, RNA polymerase III and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are among the many sensors involved in activating the I IFN response [14], [15]. Similarly, diverse pathogens activate the type III IFN response, and it appears that the type I vs. type III balance in signaling is mediated by the cellular location of the receptor, as most receptors can activate both pathways [16]. Currently, the DNA sensor Ku708 is the only identified receptor capable of activating type III not type I IFN [17].",

IL-28R responds exclusively to type III IFN, while IL-10RB is shared with IL-10 family members [4], [18]. This raises interesting, and currently unaddressed questions of potential regulation of IL-10 signaling by type III IFN or visa versa. IFN\u03bb signaling is thought to be inhibited by IL-10 but enhanced by IL-22, which also signals through IL-10RB [19], [20]. It is unclear if IL-10 and IL-22 influence IFN\u03bb signaling through receptor sequestration or through affects on interferon signaling pathways. Binding of IFN\u03bb to the IL-28R-IL-10RB dimer induces JAK-STAT signaling (Fig. 1\n), similar to type I IFN signaling, resulting in expression of over 300 interferon responsive genes [21], [22], [23]. These genes have been integrated into a searchable database known as the Interferome (v 2.0 http://interferome.its.monash.edu.au). The information from this database has identified over two thousand interferon regulated genes (IRG) and can be used to identify a specific interferon gene signature associated with a particular disease state or species of microbial infection.",

The specific localization of the IFN\u03bb receptor may allow for a more tightly regulated immune response, such as the expression of signaling inhibitors like the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins in resident cells such as the epithelium.

Type I IFNs induce a more rapid and higher magnitude response compared to type III IFNs, while type III IFNs induce a more sustained response of gene induction [30], [31], [32]. Influenza induces a more robust type III IFN response from epithelial cells, and STAT activation by type III IFN is significantly more prolonged as compared with the response to type I IFN [33], [34], [35]. Type I IFN induction of downstream genes is dependent on interferon regulatory factor (IRF) dependent, interferon-responsive sequence element (IRSE) transcription factors. Antiviral signaling downstream of type III IFNs is partially dependent on NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling activation, which could explain why in human airway epithelial culture type I IFN signaling was the primary contributor to anti-viral signaling in response to RSV [30], [36], [37]. Recently, transcription factor Med23 was shown to selectively upregulate type III not type I IFN, while type III IFN was selectively downregulated by ZEB1 [38], [39]. Therefore, while the type III IFN family is capable of activating the same genes as other IFN families, restricted receptor expression and dependence on other signaling pathways for optimal gene induction limit the influence of type III IFNs on immunity however, once activated the type III IFN family can have a more prolonged role in host defense.",

This polymorphism also correlates with natural clearance of the virus. An additional polymorphism in IFNL3, TT/\u0394G, was found to be an even better predictor of HCV clearance, due to increased expression of IFNL4\n[43], [44].

In mice, type III IFN is produced at significantly higher levels than type I IFNs in response to influenza virus, and the produced type III IFN is able to protect mice from severe influenza infection even in Ifnar\n\u2212/\u2212 mice [33]. The presence of either a functional type I or type III IFN pathway is sufficient to mount a host defense response against influenza infection, while increased viral titer is observed in mice lacking both the type I and type III IFN receptors, as well as in Stat1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice in which both type I and type III IFN pathways are inhibited [33], [52], [53]. Similarly, clearance of SARS-CoV was found to be dependent on STAT1, but not type I, II, or III IFN receptors, suggesting that these pathways can compensate for each other in their response to some viral pathogens. Host defense against other viruses in the murine system is more dependent on the type III IFN pathway. For example, herpes simplex virus (HSV) clearance requires activation of type III IFN and systemic elimination of murine norovirus requires IFN lambda [38], [54]. Treatment with type III IFN is also progressing for the treatment of viral infections. Phase 2b studies on patients with chronic hepatitis C showed improved viral suppression and fewer side effects with type III versus type 1 IFN therapy [55]. As of now it is unclear why the dependence on type III IFN differs between these viral infections, however it could be due to the type of cell involved in clearing these infections and their relative level of type III IFN receptor expression.",

Typhimurium can occur with both live and heat-killed organism, as well as via its purified LPS, akin to the type I IFN response [59]. The in vitro response of human cells to S. Typhimurium occurs rapidly within 2\u20134 h after infection and is maintained over a 24 h period. This transcription still occurs even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. To gain a better understanding of the pathway Pietila et al. [56] showed that type III IFN production was inhibited with inhibitors to p38 kinase, PI3K and NF-\u03baB, but not ERK or JNK kinase. Interferon stimulated genes such as CXCL10 were also inhibited. Consistent with LPS inducing the activation of type III IFN, inhibition of dynamin-dependent endocytosis abolishment secretion, presumably by interfering with the TRIF-TRAM signal. While it is known that type I IFN plays an inhibitory role in infection [60], a role is yet to be identified in Salmonella infection.",

Activation of type III IFN in intestinal epithelial cells occurs in multiple stages. An initial induction occurs as the bacteria are internalized then a later phase that corresponds to escape from the vacuole. Internalization of L. monocytogenes and hence type III IFN induction requires the expression of the invasion proteins LnlA and LnlB, while listeriolysin that mediates escape into the cytosol is also required for type III IFNs to be induced [58].",

The LntA (Listeria nuclear targeted protein A) protein is able to target the protein BAHD1 in the cell nucleus [57]. BAHD1 is a chromatin repressor that is capable of repressing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Intestinal epithelial cells are able to activate type III IFN when stimulated with L. monocytogenes but not in the absence of LntA [57], [58]. Under normal conditions, the targeting of BAHD1 by LntA facilitates production of type III IFNs. The role of LntA and type III IFN in infection is a perfect example of a pathogen fine tuning expression of a virulence factor. Inactivation of LntA leads to improved clearance in animal models, while constitutive expression of LntA that leads to higher type III production also leads to enhanced clearance.",

The ability to induce type III IFN appears to correlate with clinical isolates. Clinical isolates typically induce a much more robust interferon (type I or III) response than isolates less frequently associated with infection [65]. The ability of B. burgdorferi to activate type III IFN appears to be dependent on the plasmid lp36.

Mice lacking IL-28R have significantly improved outcomes to infection with improved bacterial clearance from the airway and lung tissue, improved pulmonary pathology and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production compared to equally infected control mice. One cytokine reduced in this model is IL-1\u03b2, which when the IL1-R is antagonized in vivo, improved clearance of S. aureus is also observed. Type I IFN is known to influence the activation of PDCD4 that influences proinflammatory cytokine production. PDCD4 is regulated by miR-21. Cohen et al. [22] showed miR-21 to be increased after infection that concomitantly reduced PDCD4, attributing the reduced cytokine production observed in Il28r\n\u2212/\u2212 mice to this result.

Induction of type III IFN was observed to be decreased in cystic fibrosis compared to control airway epithelial cells [68]. Il28r\n\u2212/\u2212 mice when intranasally infected with P. aeruginosa are able to more effectively clear the infection from the airway and lung tissue, with the associated improvement in pulmonary pathology and reduction in proinflammatory cytokine production [22].

An additional mechanism to explain the ability of type III IFN signaling to aid bacterial persistence is biofilm formation. In an in vitro cell culture model, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was observed to increase P. aeruginosa biofilm formation [69]. This biofilm formation was shown to be both type I and type III IFN dependent, with knockdown or antibody neutralization of the receptors reducing P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in the presence of RSV infection [69].",

Live attenuated influenza vaccine was found to enhance the carriage levels of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus in the nasopharynx [83]. Likewise in humans, vaccine administration was found to alter the nasal microbiome with an increase in IFN gene signatures and elevated carriage of Staphylococcal species [84]. In this study, interferon induction was responsible for the increased susceptibility to bacterial infection in a murine model, as induction of IFN signaling with poly(I:C) resulted in increased bacterial carriage [84].",

While in many cases the overall diversity remained unchanged increases in commensal staphylococci were observed. This change in microbiota was shown to be type III IFN and STAT1 dependent. Influenza infected mice were also more susceptible to S. aureus colonization and subsequent aspiration of organisms into the lung. This susceptibility was dependent upon type III IFN signaling. In a model of acute S. aureus lung infection post-influenza, mice previously infected with influenza had higher bacterial burdens in the lung that were reduced in the absence of type III IFN signaling [85]. Therefore the type III IFN pathway promotes both colonization of the airway and subsequent infection of the lower airway.",

Type III IFN therapy is undergoing clinical trials with hepatitis C infection and polymorphisms in human in IFNL3 can predict improved outcomes to therapy. Type III IFN induces a similar repertoire of genes as type I IFN over a prolonged period of time. Several studies have identified that bacterial pathogens can activate the type III IFNs. Clinical data and the use of knockout mice have identified several pathogens that appear to flourish when type III IFN is induced. These data indicate type III IFN signaling as a novel pathway for potential host immunomodulation in an era where antibiotic resistance is of increasing concern and over exuberant host responses contribute to morbidity and mortality.",
