            "text": "Mathematical models have become important instruments in the analysis and control of infectious diseases. Several models corresponding to epidemic with different characteristics have been proposed and discussed in literature. The fundamental assumption in epidemic models is that the population can be divided into distinct groups; the most common are: the susceptible (S) that are the subjects that may catch the disease; the infected (I) that are the subjects that are already infected and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals; the removed (R) that are the subject that are immune for life. Therefore these models are referred to as SIR models. Other descriptions may include the presence of subjects in the quarantine state (Q) and in this situation SIRQ models are analyzed [1]. Recently in [2] the class of cross-immune individuals (C) in the population has been introduced: it is an intermediate state between the fully susceptible state (S) and the fully protected one (R). Therefore the obtained SIRC model takes into account temporary partial immunity and may well describe, for example, influenza A.",

In [10] the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) disease was considered to find the strategy of tracing and quarantining contacts of identified cases; it was shown that this can be very successful in reducing transmission. In [11] it was proved that a maximum quarantine/isolation measures for the exposed and the infectious class would reduce the SARS epidemics; a bang\u2013bang switching control was obtained. In the last decade great attention has been devoted to the modeling and control of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; in [12] an output feedback scheme based in CD4 T-cell and viral load measurements has been introduced. For the control in Dengue epidemics optimal and sub-optimal strategies were considered in [13]; the effects of educational campaigns organized to motivate the population to break the reproduction cycle of the mosquitoes by avoiding the accumulation of still water in open-air recipients were modeled and the assumed cost index reflected a compromise between actual financial spending and population health. Optimal and suboptimal solutions were introduced also in [14] with reference to quarantine and isolation control in SARS epidemics, demonstrating that the maximal applications of the control strategies in the early stage of the epidemic were of very significant impact in both the considered control cases.",

Among the cause of death related with influenza, pneumonia, heart and circulatory are the most significant; moreover most of these deaths are in individuals in the age group over 65 years whereas younger children are at significant risk of influenza hospitalization. These considerations lead to recommendation of vaccination for subjects above 64 years (59 in some countries) and for young children (above 6 months). Characteristic of influenza is its seasonality; the peaks of the influenza are related with the weather condition, and social patterns, for example schools holidays.",

The same results were obtained also for R\u00af=10, with a q\nI equal to \u221212% and a location of the peak of influence after a week of the beginning of the control period. These results (Case I and II for R\u00af=6 and R\u00af=10) were reasonable, since in the cost index it was privileged the minimization over the number of susceptible subjects. It is particularly interesting the behavior of the control over the susceptible: after a first decreasing period (about 40 days) it increased again, see Fig. 10\nas an example of Case I, R\u00af=6. This is due increased contact rate that requested an additional control.",

All the possible strategies should face with the limitations of the resource. In this paper the controls both in the susceptible and in the infected classes are introduced, taking into account the constraints in the controls. A suitable cost index is proposed and existence result is assessed. The aim is to minimize the susceptible and infected subjects with as less resources as possible; the analytical expressions of the optimal controls are provided and their numerical implementation is discussed. Numerical results are presented comparing the effects of different control strategies, showing interesting and encouraging results.",
