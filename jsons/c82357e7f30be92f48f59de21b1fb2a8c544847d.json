Of note, Wenzhou City was the second epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and had the second largest number of cases reported. 3 Discharge criteria were as follows: (1) > 3 days of normal body temperature, (2) resolved respiratory symptoms, (3) substantially improved acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography (CT), and (4) negative RT-PCR test results for both two consecutive salivary tests (with at least 1 day between tests) and one fecal nucleic acid (RNA) test. 4 In all these patients, treatment included nebulized \u03b1-interferon, as recommended by the Chinese COVID-19 Management Guidance, 5 until the aforementioned criteria for hospital discharge were met. Discharged patients were asked to follow strict protocols for self-isolation at designated hotels and away from family or relatives for 2 weeks. This study was approved by our local IRB, waiving informed consent for de-identified data.",

All three cases had improved with no increase in their temperature, and improvement in WBC and lymphocyte counts, as well as their CT scans. Compared with 17 patients with negative RT-PCR results at week 1 follow-up, there were no significant differences in WBC (6.0 vs. 4.9, p = 0.38) or lymphocyte counts (1.9 vs. 1.6, p = 0.25).",

Two weeks after discharge, all three patients tested negative for viral RNA. Interestingly, there was no difference in symptoms between those who remained negative and those who were positive; all cases experienced steady improvement. Because all discharged patients followed a strict protocol for self-isolation, we believe that the RNA positivity at follow-up is unlikely to be due to reinfection. It remains also uncertain whether recovered COVID-19 patients with positive RT-PCR results are able to transmit the infection to others by close contact. These findings suggest that strict self-isolation protocols and extended follow-up periods might be needed for recovered COVID-19 patients.",

First, this is a small sample (n = 20), meaning that our results are preliminary and cannot be used to predict the proportion with recurrently positive tests. Secondly, while adherence to self-quarantine in our population is high, it is possible that this represents reinfection rather than persistent infection. Larger and longer-term prospective studies are needed to better understand the outcome of COVID-19.",
