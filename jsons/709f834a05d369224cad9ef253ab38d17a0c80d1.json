            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant barriers to timely donor evaluation, cell collection, and graft transport for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserved grafts before the start of pretransplantation conditioning. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCY) is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts and 256 received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. These patients were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI), and propensity score with 1080 patients who underwent allo-HCT with fresh grafts. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh graft versus a cryopreserved graft, was calculated using logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT Comorbidity Index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type, and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only P values <.01 were considered statistically significant. The 2 cohorts (cryopreserved and fresh) were similar in terms of patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-CI, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] , 68.3% to 73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (95% CI, 64.6% to 75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (P = .81). Corresponding probabilities of OS at 2 years were 60.6% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.8%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 51.9% to 65.4%) (P = .62). In matched-pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for cryopreserved versus fresh, 1.05; 95% CI, .86 to 1.29; P = .60). Similarly, rates of neutrophil recovery (HR, .91; 95% CI, .80 to 1.02; P = .12), platelet recovery (HR, .88; 95% CI, .78 to 1.00; P = .05), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR, .78; 95% CI, .50 to 1.22; P = .27), NRM (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .86 to 1.55; P = .32) and relapse/progression (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, .97 to 1.50; P = .09) were similar with cryopreserved grafts versus fresh grafts. There were somewhat lower rates of chronic GVHD (HR, 78; 95% CI, .61 to .99; P = .04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; P = .04) with graft",

These travel restrictions, combined with potentially reduced HCT donor availability (due to infection, quarantine, and constraints on travel to collection centers) and complex allograft processing logistics (ie, donor assessment, collection, and on-schedule delivery for fresh infusion), directly impact a transplantation center's ability to infuse fresh donor cells into intended recipients on the scheduled day of transplantation. Recognizing these challenges, both the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) [9] and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) [10] initially issued a strong recommendation that all unrelated donor (URD) products be delivered and cryopreserved at transplantation centers before initiation of patient conditioning. On March 23, 2020, the NMDP informed transplantation centers that starting on March 30, 2020, cryopreservation of URD grafts would be required before initiating conditioning in transplant recipients [10] . Many transplantation centers have instituted similar practices for HCT using cells from related donors.",

The propensity score is the probability of a given patient to receive the cryopreserved graft, based on that patient's observed covariates. The propensity score was predicted for each patient using logistic regression accounting for following risk factors: disease histology (acute myelogenous leukemia versus acute lymphocytic leukemia versus chronic myelogenous leukemia versus chronic lymphocytic leukemia versus myelodysplastic syndrome versus non-Hodgkin lymphoma versus Hodgkin lymphoma), Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (90% versus <90%), HCT-Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) (0 versus 1 to 2 versus 3), conditioning intensity (MAC versus RIC/NMA), donor type (MRD versus haploidentical related donor versus 8/ 8 matched URD versus 7/8 URD) and recipient race. Two patients with equal propensity scores meant they had similar probabilities of receiving a cryopreserved graft. The distributions of estimated propensity scores between cryopreserved and fresh grafts were examined. We then matched each recipient of a cryopreserved graft with controls receiving fresh grafts, by matching on 4 covariates: graft type (BM versus PB), DRI (low risk versus intermediate risk versus high risk), recipient age (within 5 years), and propensity score (within 1 standard deviation from the pooled sample).

The most important finding of our analysis is that OS out to 2 years was virtually identical with fresh grafts and cryopreserved grafts. Second, there was no evidence of significantly delayed hematopoietic recovery or higher risks of either acute or chronic GVHD with cryopreservation. Marginal increases in relapse/progression and marginal decreases in chronic GVHD and DFS are of uncertain significance given the multiple comparisons in the study and the fact that this was not a randomized study. In fact, a key piece of information was unavailable to us, which is why these grafts were cryopreserved. One can reasonably assume that this was not a random decision. Although some delays might be precipitated by donor scheduling issues, many were likely influenced by clinical events necessitating requiring a delay in transplantation, and these events themselves might be indicators of prognosis (eg, delay because of the need for chemotherapy to achieve better pretransplantation disease control). Given this background, the similar survival outcomes are particularly reassuring. ",

Administration of ptCY potentially mitigates the risk of GVHD by targeting alloreactive T cells that are rapidly proliferating early after stem cell infusion, and by relatively sparing regulatory T cells and leaving the nondividing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells unaffected [20] . Whether the proliferation kinetics of thawed alloreactive T cells different from those of fresh cells is not known. Murine data suggest that freezing and thawing of regulatory T cells results in loss of CD62L expression and a reduced capacity to protect against GVHD [26] . In addition, limited data indicate that cryopreservation can increase the sensitivity of porcine PB mononuclear cells (stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate) for IFN-g production, but not for IL-6 production [27] . Despite these preclinical observations, our analysis did not reveal any clinically relevant differences in hematopoietic recovery kinetics, acute GVHD risk, or OS between fresh versus cryopreserved grafts for patients undergoing ptCYbased allo-HCT. Limited data in allo-HCT (with non-ptCY-based GVHD prophylaxis) using either BM [2\u00c05] or PB [6, 7] as the graft source also show no impact of cryopreservation on hematopoietic recovery, GVHD, or survival outcomes. Although of uncertain clinical significance, the observations of lower chronic GVHD and DFS warrant further investigation, especially probing the impact on the freeze-thaw cycle on functional profile of immune effector cells. However, in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating cryopreservation of all URD grafts and the majority of related donor products, our data do not show a net safety signal against the use of ptCY-based platforms with frozen products. In this ongoing global outbreak, the ability to cryopreserve allografts has obvious logistical advantages, the most important being the ability to secure a graft before myeloablative therapy in a transplant recipient. Even under normal circumstances, it is sometimes advantageous to ensure the availability of an optimal stem cell dose before the start of conditioning (eg, in the setting of major donor/recipient weight discrepancy and/or advanced donor age).",
