Amongst those, interferonalpha and cinanserin displayed the strongest inhibitory activities. Interestingly, cinanserin is a well-characterized serotonin antagonist that has already undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s. [2] [3] [4] Cinanserin has been identified as candidate inhibitor of the SARS-CoV 3C-like proteinase by virtual screening of a database containing structural information of more than 8,000 existing drugs using a docking approach for potential binding to the SARS-CoV 3C-like proteinase. 5 Subsequently, binding of cinanserin to bacterially expressed SARS-CoV 3C-like proteinase and inhibition of its enzymatic activity was demonstrated experimentally. Antiviral activity of cinaserin was further evaluated in two tissue culture-based assays. First, we have used our safe replicon assay and could demonstrate a strong inhibitory activity of cinanserin. Second, we could demonstrate a strong inhibition (up to 4 log reduction of virus RNA and infectious particles) of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E replication in tissue culture.",

We have introduced the gene for a selectable marker (neo) into the HCoV 229E replicase gene and we have replaced three structural genes (S, E, and M), and two accessory genes (4a and 4b), by a reporter gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). A stable cell line, designated BHK-Rep-1, that contains the replicon RNA has been selected using G418.

            "text": "One of the main targets for antiviral intervention is the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ). The 3CL pro is responsible for the proteolytic release of replicative proteins from their replicase precursor polyproteins and is, therefore, considered indispensable for virus replication. 7 In order to identify candidate 3CL pro inhibitors, a homology model of the binding pocket of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro , based on crystallographic structures of TGEV and HCoV229E proteinases, 8 was used as target for screening in silico. Screened compounds were derived from the Comprehensive Medical Chemistry database of Mol. Design Limited, which contains pharmacological and structural information of >8000 compounds used or evaluated as therapeutic agents in humans. Cinanserin, a well-characterized serotonin antagonist, showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for experimental testings. First, the SARS-CoV 3CL pro was expressed in E. coli, and the purified enzyme was used to demonstrate (i) binding of cinanserin to 3CL pro , and (ii), inhibition of 3CL pro by cinanserin in vitro. Maximum inhibition was observed at concentrations of 50-100 \u00b5M (data not shown). Second, we have used the BHK-Rep-1 cells to assess the inhibitory activity of cinanserin in tissue culture. BHK-Rep-1 cells were treated for 3 days with cinanserin, and the expression of GFP was analyzed by FACS and fluorescence microscopy. The number of green fluorescent cells was greatly reduced at a concentration of 30 \u00b5g/ml (Figure 3a ). This indicates that cinanserin is able to enter the target cell and inhibit coronavirus replicase function. Finally, Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV and treated with cinanserin (0-50 \u00b5g/ml). Two days postinfection, virus RNA in the tissue culture supernatant was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 3b ). In addition the titer of infectious particles in the supernatant was measured by immunofocus assay (Figure 3c ). Our results clearly dose-dependent and half-maximal inhibition could be achieved with only 10 U/ml. In contrast, the maximal inhibitory effects of ribavirin and glycyrrhizin did not exceed 10%. demonstrate that both viral RNA in the tissue culture supernatant and infectious particles were greatly reduced by up to 4 log units.",
