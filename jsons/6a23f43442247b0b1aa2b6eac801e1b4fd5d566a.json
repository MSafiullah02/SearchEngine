(6) In the near future, serological testing will be required to assess the effectiveness of vaccine candidates and finally, they are also useful to identify individuals who developed a strong immunological response to the virus and whose antibody isolates can be used to treat patients via plasma therapy. (7) However, several challenges still remain to correctly address the appropriate implementation, validation and interpretation of serological testing. Among them, understanding the kinetics of the antibodies matters as divergent opinion are reported in the literature. (8, 9) Our group recently reported the validation of a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for IgG determination (LIAISON\u00aeSARS-CoV-2, DiaSorin\u00ae, Saluggia, Italy) and reported the excellent analytical and clinical performance of the assay. However, data on antibody kinetics and assessment of IgA were not conveyed yet on this cohort. Statistical analyses show they are representative of the full cohort. Figure 1 reports the change from the baseline and sensitivity at weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3 for IgA and IgG determinations. Both immunoglobulin levels increase over time and tend to stabilize after two weeks.",
