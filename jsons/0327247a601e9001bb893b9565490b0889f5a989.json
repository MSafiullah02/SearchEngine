The Commonwealth is an ideally placed network to tackle these global health challenges, with its wide-reaching networks of governmental, non-governmental and civil society organisations across all continents. Although the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) originally scheduled to take place in Kigali in Rwanda 22-27 June 2020 has been postponed in view of COVID-19, Commonwealth country discussions are continuing, centred on the CHOGM key theme of 'Delivering a Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming', and five subthemes of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Innovation; Trade; Environment; Governance and the Rule of Law; and Youth. The planned CHOGM and Commonwealth itself provides all members a timely platform to consider innovative ways to connect, innovate and transform healthcare to meet the needs of their populations. This commentary considers these five CHOGM subthemes and how member nations can be supported to achieve universal health coverage through optimising medicines use and outcomes, in the midst of a global pandemic in line with the global health agenda.",

However, we should be aware that ICT should help address and not add to existing inequities both within societies and between LMICs [13] . The use of electronic or faxed prescriptions and 'mail-order' or 'home-delivery' pharmacy models to facilitate remote healthcare are all potential solutions that can help ensure ongoing pharmaceutical supply to patients whilst minimising the need for in-person interactions [8, 14] . However, the technology required to support these models of care delivery are not fully integrated in some countries, including many LMICs. As pharmacies in other higher income Commonwealth countries such as the UK, Australia and NZ move towards these new models of delivery [15] , we must ensure that LMICs are not left behind. There is reassuring evidence to suggest this will not be the case. With increasingly widespread mobile phone use, African nations have pioneered in mobile banking, which is widely used across the continent since mPesa was established in 2007 [16] . Initiatives, such as the launch of the Ghanaian COVID-19 tracker app [17] follow this trend of digital innovation.",

There is a large evidence base demonstrating widespread problems with poor quality antimicrobial drugs and other essential medicines in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [20, 21] . The COVID-19 pandemic only serves to exacerbate such issues, including the risk of misinformation and false claims, for example through the use of SF medication for preventing and treating COVID-19 [22, 23] . Poor quality medicines are a significant barrier to UHC and undermine efforts to improve healthcare [24] . Consequences of using SF medicines include antimicrobial resistance, adverse drug reactions, toxicity, and treatment failure [19] . With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased urgent need to fast-track the development of technologies to counter falsified claims, detect poor quality medicines and save lives, as well as share innovation in this area. For example, the MPedigree barcode scanning app has been implemented in several African countries to allow checking of the validity of medicines [25] . Additionally, new technologies such as PharmaCheck, which uses a handheld scanner to analyse medicines, offer competitive new ICT solutions [19] to build regulatory technical capacity. Medicines quality assurance requires a robust regulatory system overseen by a medicines regulatory agency, however in many LMICs this is limited by resource and capacity constraints. However, pharmacoviligance reporting apps developed by regulatory authorities in Ghana [26] and Zambia [27] , highlight how digital innovation can enhance regulatory systems. Real-time 'point of sale' reporting devices or mobile apps such as 'MedSnap', a mobile phone app that is capable of identifying medications, and assist with the data collection and monitoring of SF medicines [28] , is currently being trialled by the CPA in partnership with the Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia. This is intended to synergise with the pharmacoviligance reporting app developed by the FDA to build greater medicines regulatory capacity.",

Shared common information platforms, such as the online resource portals created by national pharmacy associations and international organisations such as the CPA and International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), can facilitate the timely exchange of news, alerts on outbreaks, opportunities for collaborations and support continuing professional development (CPD) between pharmacists. To facilitate this, regional and national policies and ICT linkages need to be established, as well as infrastructure to support access to stable internet and connectivity particularly in rural and deprived areas. CPD to improve pharmacist technology literacy will also need to be prioritised [33] . For example, in Zambia, there is an increasing demand for pharmacy services, with growing numbers of pharmacists keen to upskill and evolve new roles to expand the breadth of the profession. In line with a recent change to mandatory CPD, the CPA have worked closely with Zambia to explore the opportunities for delivering CPD via an online learning platform to address pharmacist training gaps. Many medicine information resources and centres are online, which can act as repositories of evidence-based information. However, in many healthcare settings, internet access can be intermittent and there is a need for easy access to key information, compiled in one place that can be made available offline. A successful example of this is the Commonwealth Partnerships for Antimicrobial Stewardship (CwPAMS) app which supports the rational use of antimicrobials, beginning with Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia [34] .",

The Commonwealth can achieve this by promoting local manufacturing capacity through supporting local companies to become Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliant, establishing bioequivalence centres to support the local industry, providing financial support (e.g. long-term, low-interest patient capital), and linking to other countries with strong local manufacturing capacity (e.g. India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana), which can help increase global competitiveness. For example, in Ghana, initiatives to foster a manufacturing 'hub' are anticipated to foster economic growth in the pharmaceutical sector and improve access to quality assured medicines. This includes tax exemption on raw materials and essential medicines produced locally and a 15% local price preferment strategy [41] .

Disposal of medicines is also costly with some countries facing fees charged by regulators to dispose medicines, or high costs to use incinerators to safely dispose pharmaceuticals [49] . Countries need to move towards free disposals to encourage more responsible disposal, for example by developing guidelines and allocating funding to provide the needed infrastructure to support safe disposal of medicines, green and eco-friendly manufacturing, and campaigns to promote public awareness [50] .

Pharmacists are skilled worldwide to provide more extensive public-facing servicessuch as family planning, HIV testing, screening, and vaccination. These extended pharmacy servicesparticularly vaccination serviceswill be key for achieving population vaccination coverage when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, especially as pharmacies are one of the most accessible health providers in the community [54] . The effectiveness of utilising pharmacists for public health interventions has been highlighted through Commonwealth initiatives led by female pharmacist groups to set-up clinical breast screening and raise awareness to reach the most vulnerable communities. This would help with healthcare access for the public yet policy-level barriers need to be overcome to enable full utilisation of the pharmacy workforce globally, as well as cold-chain issues.",

Pharmacists should be key stakeholders on all discussions involving medicines if systems and policies are to be well thought out and effective. Governments need pharmacist skillsets, but steps need to be taken to strengthen the profession and ensure they are appropriately regulated and recognised. This good governance facilitates better regulation of medicines, pharmacists and pharmacies. Without legislation or governance that specifically defines pharmacist roles and pharmacy practice, it is difficult to advocate for the expanding role of pharmacists. For example, in Zambia, the pharmacy profession is not currently self-regulated despite 60% of budget being spent on pharmaceuticals. There is a need for pharmacists to have their own pharmacy council to clarify roles and functions of regulatory agencies, whilst preventing overlap in functions leading to over-regulation and associated financial burdens. Pharmacy councils are needed to address issues at a national level collectively via implementation of regulations. For example, the Pharmacy Council and Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana, together with Management Sciences for Health (MSH), conducted a pharmaceutical service mapping exercise of a rural region in Ghana to highlight gaps to improve access to quality assured medicines. Other examples of issues where collaborative actions are required include SF medicines and its contribution to AMR, ensuring honest and corruption-free systems, and reviewing licencing systems so licenses to practice are based on a minimum required level of skill and knowledge to ensure public safety. For example, community unregulated sale of medicines, such as at markets and stores, in particular antibiotics, are of high concern in many LMICs [55] . The CwPAMS has brought together practitioners and policy makers and raised these issues leading to acknowledgment and action by pharmacy councils to work with unlicensed sellers of antibiotics to address these issues [34] . There is potential for the CPA to support this by creating online knowledge sharing symposia, webinars or online workshops.",

Engaging with the youth in policy development and stakeholder representationfor example through establishing local and national Young Pharmacists Groups and linking with the Commonwealth Youth Network, WHO Global Health Workforce Network (Youth Hub)are key first steps. The different mindset and priorities of the youth generation needs to be consideredinnovative ways to entice young people in key health professional roles are needed. Many youth enjoy portfolio working and travel opportunitiesknowledge and skill exchanges such as twinning and health partnership programmes between LMICs and other countries, for example the CwPAMS scheme [34] , may be particularly attractive to youth.

At the national and global level, governments and health organisations need to ensure that any increase in number in the pharmacy workforce is matched by an increase in pharmacy roles and job vacancies. For example, in Zambia, there are nearly 200-300 new pharmacists each year, in Rwanda the number of pharmacists has grown rapidly after the establishment of the Rwanda Community Pharmacists' Union in 2016 [56] , and in Tanzania, there are over 1900 pharmacists, including 500 hospital pharmacists; with such rapid growth in the pharmacy profession, there is a need to ensure jobs and roles for new graduates. This will include in clinical settings in hospitals, where pharmacists have key roles in ensuring rational medicines use as part of multidisciplinary team. In many LMICs, pharmacists still hold a traditional supply role and clinical pharmacy is at a nascent stage [5] . Skill sharing initiatives such as CwPAMS with settings where clinical pharmacy has been wellestablished have led to expanding pharmacists' roles and cultivating a culture of clinical pharmacy, gain policyleader interest. The CPA are currently exploring approaches to expand and sustain this through sharing education and skills to meet the demands of the growing workforce and population health priorities. However, in certain countries, there is a current lack of employment in the public sector, and the lack of funds available to pharmacists to support the establishment of businesses are perceived as barriers. It is critical the momentum and energy behind the growing pharmacy profession is capitalised on to support progress towards SDG 3 and beyond.",
