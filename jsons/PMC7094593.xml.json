The 29.7 kb genome structure of SARS-CoV contains a single positive stranded RNA harboring 14 open reading frames (ORFs) which are translated into a large polyprotein which is processed by viral encoded protease to derive the individual proteins [3], [4]. One of the structural proteins from ORF8a encodes a membrane-associated protein with 39 amino acids and contains a single transmembrane domain (TMD) with a length of approximately 22 residues [5]. ORF 8a has been proposed not only to enhance viral replication but also to induce apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway [5]. Its topology and biological function remains yet unknown.",

They change chemical or electrochemical gradients by altering ion permeability of the lipid membrane and modulate cellular response by interacting with membrane proteins of the host [6], [7], [8], [9]. Several VCPs have been detected as ion channels, especially when reconstituted into lipid bilayers. VCPs are suggested to be encoded in the genomes of enveloped and naked viruses and also chlorella plant virus PBCV-1. VCPs, like host channels and pore forming microbial peptides [10], [11], [12], [13], have to assemble to form homo oligomeric bundles. They are found to consist of approximately 80 to 100 amino acids. Exceptions emerge with the discovery of 3a from SARS-CoV with a length of 274 amino acids [14] and, based on this study, of ORF8a with 39 amino acids.",

A set of different oligomeric bundle models raging from 4 to 6 units is generated. The generation of computational bundle models follows the \u2018two stage model\u2019 [15], [16]. In short, this model suggests that the secondary structure of a protein is generated prior to its tertiary or quaternary structure. The identification and structural characterization of the new ion channel protein \u2014 ORF8a from SARS-CoV \u2014 will be helpful for the design of novel drugs against SARS.",

After completion of the synthesis, the peptide was cleaved from the resin using 95% TFA/water and 3% triisopropylsilane for 3 h at room temperature. After cleavage the crude peptide was precipitated with ether and lyophilized. The crude peptide was purified by preparative RP-HPLC on a 21 \u00d7 300 mm Kromasil column with a flow rate of 70 ml/min.

Lipids were dissolved in chloroform, dried under N2 gas and re-suspended in pentane and decane 9:1. Approximately 1 \u03bcl lipid suspension was brushed over the Delrin cup aperture (diameter 150 \u03bcl) and dried. Then 3 \u03bcl of peptide dissolved in trifluoroethanol (TFE) were added onto the aperture in the same way as the lipids. The lipid bilayer was formed by raising the level of the buffer (300 mM or 30 mM KCl, 5 mM K-HEPES, pH = 7.05) of both trans- (ground) and cis-side (head stage). The current response was recorded using Planar Lipid Bilayer Workstation from Warner Instruments with a BC-353 amplifier and 1440A data acquisition system. Temperature was set to 38.5 \u00b0C using a Bipolar Temperature Controller Model CL-100 from Warner Instruments. A constant positive voltage of 70 mV (cis-side) was applied during lipid bilayer formation to achieve an asymmetric orientation of the peptides within the bilayer [17]. Records were filtered with 10 Hz using a Bessel-8-pole low pass filter, digitized at 10 Hz and stored for further analysis.",

An ideal helix of TMD of ORF8a (LLIVLTCI10 SLCSCICTVV20, 8a3\u201320) has been created using integrated protein builder of MOE (www.chemcomp.com). The helix was embedded into a lipid bilayer (POPC). Overlapping lipid molecules were removed using the MOE suite. The lipid\u2013peptide system was then further processed using GROMACS-3.3 (www.gromacs.org). The topology and structure of the POPC bilayer was prepared as described elsewhere [23]. The lipid\u2013peptide system was hydrated and a short minimization routine using steepest descent and conjugate gradients followed to remove unfavorable interactions. A short equilibration (500 ps) followed with the peptide restrained at the C\u03b1 atoms. At this stage the lipids were expected to surround the peptide adequately.

Short ideal helices from Met-1 to Ile-5 and Thr-18 to Arg-22 were generated. They were aligned and superimposed with those residues from the bundle models. Those residues of the short helices which overlapped with the residues of the bundle models have been deleted and the remaining residues of the short helices conjoined with residues of the bundle models. This finally delivered bundle models of 8a1\u201322. The selected bundle models were then embedded into a pre-equilibrated (70 ns) hydrated POPC bilayer [23].",

The values are almost unchanged in respect to the values found during the assembly process (Fig. 3A). The tilts show the lowest deviations for TBMs and PBMs. The averaged inter-helical distance of the TBMs is between 6\u20137 \u00c5 (Table 1). For the PBMs the inter-helical distance is larger with values of 8 to 11 \u00c5. In the HBMs the distance is around 9 \u00c5, but shows large standard deviation. Visual inspection of all bundles reveals that most of the bundles fail to retain a circular pore assembly except TBM3, PBM2 and PBM3. The averaged minimum pore radii for the models are calculated (HOLE) to be (4.4 \u00b1 0.2) \u00c5 for PBM2 and (3.5 \u00b1 0.4) \u00c5 for PBM3 (Table 1). The minimum pore radius can be located with an accuracy of \u00b1 2.3 \u00c5 for PBM2 and \u00b1 2.7 \u00c5 for PBM3. For TBM3 the pore radius is calculated to be below 1.5 \u00c5 over the entire length of the pore which is too small to harbor any water molecules. As a result, water filled bundles of the TMD of ORF8a should adopt approximately a + 40\u00b0 tilt with a distance between the helices in respect to their long axis of 11 \u00c5 (Fig. 5\nfor PBM2). With this large tilt hydrophilic residues Thr-8 and Ser-11 as well as Cys-15 of one helix form the hydrophilic stretch, whilst Ser-14 and Thr-18 are positioned at an inter-helical site. Lys-2 remains in an outward position \u2018snorkling\u2019 for the aqueous phase and the lipid head groups. The side chains of all the arginines (Arg-22) move from an all inward facing position to such a position that they point either outside the pore or towards the helix interface interacting with Gln-21 of the neighboring helix. All assemblies in common is also a line of cysteines (Cys-9, -13, and -17) in each helix at the outside of the bundle (Fig. 5, lower left). The hour glass shape of the water column is shown in Fig. 5 (lower right). The model underpins the necessity of a balanced pattern with alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues mantling the pore to allow the existence of a continuous water column through the pore.",

In this protocol a vacuum force field (Engh-Huber [32]) has been used. In another study, helix assembly undertaken in vacuum have been compared with data derived from MD simulations in a hydrated lipid bilayer and reported to explore the same conformational space [33]. This makes the use of vacuum conditions in combination with a fine grained search of the conformational space, a powerful tool [34]. Applying MD simulations after the assembly step aims to address for the specific environment of the bundle structure such as phospholipid head group region, hydrophobic slab as well as the hydrophilic environment within the lumen of the pore.",

A cysteine residue has been suggested to be at least transiently part of the pore-lining motif of the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 [46].

Often the tilt shows rather large fluctuations and a mismatch is compensated by an alternating kink angle. With Lys-2 and Arg-22 and their flexible and extended side chains [52] at either end of the TMD a large tilt in the pentameric assembly is by all means possible for the 8a peptide bundle.

It only needs minor changes in the tilt and distance towards the central axis, but the rotational change of almost 180\u00b0 has to cross a larger barrier (Fig. 3A, middle column) in order to transform PBM2 into PBM3. It needs further computational functional analysis to discriminate between the models such as simulating the passage of an ion through each of the pore and evaluating the potential of the mean force [41]. At this stage it is suggested that both models would be present if generated under the present experimental conditions. This may reflect the situation in vivo, assuming that the proteins first diffuse by themselves freely for a short while until they are finally assembled. In case of an instant assembly at the site of in vivo production in the endoplasmic reticulum, the conformational available space would be possibly limited and a single model may emerge.",

The putative water filled pentameric bundle of the TMD of 8a should be made of helices positioned in an approximately 11 \u00c5 distance in respect to their helical long axis and with a tilt of about + 40\u00b0.",
