Pneumonia and ARDS typically develop late in the course of infection, between 5 and 10 days from the onset of symptoms [4] . This is similar to the triphasic pattern observed during the SARS epidemic in 2003, caused by a virus of the same family (SARS-CoV-1) [5] . Following an initial phase of viral replication and cytolysis, characterized by fever and flu-like symptoms, there was a second phase with worsening respiratory symptoms. Interestingly, this corresponded to the onset of seroconversion and was found to be associated with reduced viral load [6, 7] . Therefore, clinical worsening in this phase cannot be explained by viral replication, but rather by the exuberant host immune response [8] . Finally, up to 1/3 of the patients progressed to a third phase, characterized by ARDS [9] .",

In the lungs, the targeting and destruction of ACE2+ cells per se could explain most of the catastrophic consequences of COVID-19. In fact, when investigating ACE2 expression at single-cell level, it was found that ACE2 is expressed by alveolar type II (AT2) cells [30] . AT2 cells comprise only 5% of the alveoli but produce the surfactant, a factor essential to maintain lung elasticity, and, most importantly, act as progenitors for AT1 cells, the latter covering 95% of the alveoli and responsible for gas exchange. In other words, AT2 cells can be considered as alveolar stem cells [31] . Thus, COVID-19 targets and kills the lung regenerative pool. Depletion of AT2 cells and correspondent surfactant deficit have been previously shown to be associated with incomplete repair of injured alveolar epithelium and fibrotic obliteration [32] , thus could also explain the development of lung injury in COVID-19.",

Indeed, most of the COVID-19 heavily affected areas at the moment (Wuhan, North of Italy, New York) are known to have high levels of particulate or other forms of pollution [35] [36] [37] [38] .

            "text": "Overall, taking into account the above evidence, it is possible to hypothesize the scenario depicted in Fig. 2 . SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE2positive cells in the oral mucosa and lungs, including ACE2+ AT2 cells in the alveoli. In young individuals, higher levels of ACE2 [39] and ACE2+ cells, higher regenerative capacity and a strong immune response lead to an effective viral clearance with little or no symptoms. In older subjects, possibly with lower ACE2 levels, or in the presence of comorbidities that can affect the angiotensin system, such as hypertension [40] , or impair the immune response, such as diabetes, the slower viral clearance and sustained damage to ACE2+ AT2 cells goes beyond the reparative capacity [41] , causing lung inflammation, with a high risk of precipitating into ARDS because of an uncontrolled inflammatory response. This is particularly true during seroconversion, at around 7 to 14 days from the start of viral replication. At this time, when macrophages and immune cells will be already primed by elevated angiotensin II [25] , high affinity IgG can cause additional Fcmediated activation of macrophages, as previously demonstrated for SARS [42] . Although further investigations are needed to confirm this working hypothesis and additional studies should dive into the mechanisms of immune cell activation in the course of COVID-19, the current evidence would suggest reviewing the approach to the management of COVID-19, particularly in terms of applying the right therapeutics at the right time. Accordingly, the presence of a \"window of opportunity\" for the use of different classes of drugs in COVID-19 has been recently proposed [43] . For example, the use of antivirals or neutralizing antibodies is probably wrongly timed in the late pneumonia/ARDS phase, when most of the damage could be independent from viral replication. Similarly, therapies aiming at targeting ACE2 with blocking agents may be equally detrimental, with the risk of worsening an already precarious situation. Finally, the use of immunomodulatory drugs, albeit potentially effective when targeting key mediators involved in ARDS, will act on the final links in a much more complex chain of events, with a high risk of being ineffective unless applied at the right time. On the other hand, therapies to boost ACE2 activity or the lung regenerative capacity could be particularly promising for the treatment of COVID-19 [44] , as previously described for SARS [45] . ",
