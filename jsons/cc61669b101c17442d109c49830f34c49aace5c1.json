In infants and young children, these viruses are associated with many cases of acute otitis media (AOM) and rhinosinusitis. 12 Newer more sensitive diagnostic tests have increased the percentage of respiratory illnesses attributable to these viruses.

In addition, a study reported that IFN-\u03bb has antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties in primary epithelial cells from asthmatic patients exposed to rhinovirus. 34 In a recently published mouse model of HRV infection, adult mice had an enhanced type 2 immune response and attenuated type 1 response compared with neonatal mice. 35 The authors reported long-term mucosal metaplasia and airway responsiveness in HRV-infected neonatal mice.

[64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] With the global spread of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, a series of surveillance protocols were activated to monitor and characterize the pandemic. Many countries have reported on their findings in patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) who had respiratory specimens tested for a wide range of respiratory viruses. Most of the reports used PCR techniques in children or adults (\u25baTable 1). 70, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] The percentage of specimens that were positive with HRV ranged from 6.3 to 40.6%. In all the studies, the influenza illnesses could not be distinguished from HRV-related illnesses by clinical characteristics.

[87] [88] [89] [90] HRV infections lead to more severe and longerlasting lower respiratory tract symptoms. 90 Lower airway dysfunction following HRV infection may result from direct infection of the lower airway or by stimulating inflammatory, immunologic, or neurogenic mechanisms in the upper airway, thereby impacting the lower airways. HRV has been detected in the columnar and basal cell layers of the lower airways. 91 Using in situ hybridization, the replicative strand of HRV in the lower airways has been detected. 92 Experimental HRV infections in asthmatic subjects have demonstrated airway narrowing, markers of eosinophil activation, bronchial infiltration with eosinophils, CD4 cells and CD8 cells, activation of prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways, and induction of nitric oxide. [93] [94] [95] Innate immune responses were found to be defective in bronchial epithelial cells obtained from asthmatic subjects. Impaired Th1 responses to HRV were found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as reflected by significantly lower levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12, and higher levels of IL-10 from asthmatic patients compared with normal healthy volunteers. 96 Several studies have found deficient induction of IFN-\u03bb by HRV in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients. 97 Table1 Induction of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2/3 mRNAs was significantly reduced in asthmatic compared with nonasthmatic subjects. Bronchoalveolar cells in asthma patients were deficient in IFN-\u03bb after HRV was added. These studies support the view that innate immune responses in asthmatic subjects have deficiencies in two IFN families, in several lung cell types, and in response to HRV infection. HRV infections are a major cause of wheezing episodes in infants and children. [98] [99] [100] Wheezing episodes in infancy that are virus induced are often associated with asthma development in children. HRV infections that resulted in hospitalization during infancy were recently implicated as early predictors of subsequent development of asthma. 101, 102 Almost 90% of wheezing children in year 3 of the study had asthma diagnosed by 6 years of age. Outpatient HRV wheezing illnesses during infancy were also found to be predictors of wheezing through 3 years of age. [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] The possible relationship between HRV wheezing illness and genetic risk of childhood-onset asthma was studied in a group of prospectively studied children. 108 The participants were children who had been studied since birth and cultured for HRV. In children who had HRV wheezing illnesses, there was significant association with 17q21 gene locus.",

MERS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The replication cycle is similar to other CoVs. The host cell receptor for the MERS-CoV S protein is dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) or CD26. This receptor is expressed on endothelial and epithelial cells of the kidney, lung, small intestine, liver, as well as on immune cells. This ability to infect many different organ cells may explain the extrapulmonary clinical characteristics in patients. After uncoating, there is translation of ORF/a/b, followed by transcription and genome replication. Following translation on the rough ER, budding and assembly of virions occur in the cytoplasm with exocytosis and virion release. ACE2 is a SARS-CoV receptor. Upon SARS-CoV infection, ACE2 expression in lungs is markedly downregulated and therefore helps explain SARS pathogenesis and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (\u25baTable 5).",

            "text": "HRVs and HCoVs cause significant morbidity in immunocompetent people and in patients with underlying chronic or immunosuppressed medical conditions. Newer diagnostic tests have expanded our understanding of these respiratory viruses in clinical infections. These sensitive diagnostic tests have been used to detect new HRVs, such as HRV-C. Recent studies on the pathogenesis of HRVs and the host response to this group of viruses have provided insights into potential targets for therapeutic interventions. The recent outbreaks of SARS and MERS pose special problems in treatment and infection control. [269] [270] [271] Vaccine development for HCoVs and/or coronaviruses appears to be many years away.

The single-stranded, positive-sense coronavirus genomes encode the structural proteins (blue), membrane (M), spike (S), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), two replicase polyproteins (purple), ORF1a and ORF1b, and unique accessory proteins (red) that perform important functions in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis, such as blocking the innate immune signaling pathway. (B) Transmission routes. SARS-CoV transmission is thought to be from bats harboring SARS-like viruses to palm civet cats, which infected humans. SARS-CoV could also have been transmitted from bats to humans directly. MERS-CoV is thought to be transmitted from camels to humans, with the possibility that at some point bats infected camels. The dashed line identifies a low-level transmission event, the thin solid line identified a potential transmission event, and the thick solid line identifies a probable transmission event. CoV, coronavirus; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome. (Reproduced from Coleman CM, Frieman MB. Coronaviruses: important emerging human pathogens.
