We wholeheartedly agree with the importance of addressing mental health concerns amongst the many challenges of the current pandemic. This is not a new concern by any means. For example, during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the Health Commissioner of New York City declared, \u201c\u2026my aim was to prevent panic, hysteria, mental disturbance, and thus to protect the public from the condition of mind that in itself predisposes to physical ills.\u201d3 In the current coronavirus disease pandemic, effects on population mental health may be significant. Among other factors, isolation, as well as feelings of entrapment, loneliness, and bereavement can contribute to an increased suicide risk. Interventions emphasizing community support, as well as friends and family contact, are indeed recommended.4",

We wrote our paper to emphasize that this practice must be applied in the professional arena, even in high-stress work environments in which close physical contact is historically the norm (e.g., the operating room). Nevertheless, we agree that social distance should not be construed to imply social isolation. We described the importance of effective communication styles that may enhance not only productivity but also human interaction, and encourage a nuanced approach to social distancing in all settings so that we feel connected and supported in all the communities in which we live and work.",
