However, the source of convalescent serum is extremely limited and the sera have the possibility of transmitting other blood-borne infections. Although animals can be used to develop antiserum against this virus, these sera, being foreign proteins, will elicit immune responses and may cause anaphylactic reactions. Thus, it would be ideal to develop human antibodies against the SARS-CoV for prophylaxis or treatment [5]. This approach of immune therapy has been clinically successful when applied in malignant diseases and viral infections [5, 6, 7, 8].",

The S2 domain mediates membrane fusion between the virus and the host cell.

To our knowledge no mutation has been found in the S2 domain. Hence this region is more conserved than the S1 domain and may be a better target for neutralization and antibody production [10, 13]. After using a computer program to predict the immunogenicity of the S2 domain, peptides were prepared by chemical synthesis and recombinant protein expression, and used to screen the phage library displaying human scFv antibodies.",

Library diversity was confirmed by fingerprinting the amplified scFv genes after digestion with BstNI [16].

E. coli was grown at 37\u00b0 for 30 min and then the culture was plated on TYE plates containing 15 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline. After overnight growth, colonies were scraped from the plates and used to generate phage for a second round of selection as described [15].",

Based on the predicted antigenicity, hydrophilicity, accessibility, and secondary structures, two epitopes, S2a (S783-798) and S2b (S803-828), on the S2 domain of spike protein were determined to be antigenic and were used to select single-chain antibodies.

Nevertheless, we were able to obtain one clone highly specific to the S2 domain of the spike protein. Hence this method may be useful for other hydrophobic peptide target. The library can be depleted by blank recombinant protein without the peptide and the recombinant peptide does not need conjugation with carrier proteins such as BSA or OVA.",
