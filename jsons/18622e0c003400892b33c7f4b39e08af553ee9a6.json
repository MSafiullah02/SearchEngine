The current paper considers Tennessee's \"open-testing\" policy where the state substantially increased the number of available tests while opening testing to all individuals that wanted a test; this is unlike most other states that have required that individuals must be showing specific symptoms in order to be tested. In the current paper, we examine whether Tennessee's policy has affected (i) the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, (ii) the number of trips to work, and (iii) the (unobserved) number of actual Covid-19 cases. To study these effects, we employ standard identifying assumptions in the policy evaluation literature, but this strategy is greatly complicated by the non-random nature of the tests. We construct bounds on the policy effects of interest. We find suggestive evidence that Tennessee's open-testing policy has led to a reduction in the number of confirmed and total cases as well as reduced travel in counties that have experienced relatively large increases in confirmed cases. * Li dedicates this paper to the memory of his late mother, Mrs. Qing Zheng, who passed away on April 21, 2020.",

In particular, individuals who are more likely to have Covid-19 appear to be much more likely to take the test. For most states, including Alabama, this is by construction: showing certain symptoms is a requirement to be able to be tested for . Even in Tennessee, where the policy allows any individual that would like to get a test to take it for free, it still seems likely to be the case that there is some selection into taking the test. In practice, this creates two challenges. First, it is not possible to compare counties that had the same number of total Covid-19 cases before the open-testing policy was implemented because the total number of Covid-19 cases is not observed. Second, and for the same reason, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of the policy on the total number of Covid-19 cases. 3 We propose several strategies for dealing with nonrandomly missing testing data (discussed at length below). In particular, we make relatively weak assumptions on the fraction of untested individuals that have had Covid-19 that lead to bounds on the policy effects of interest.",

For the per capita number of total Covid-19 cases (which is the relatively harder case due to suffering from both issues mentioned above), we obtain non-trivial bounds on the effect of the policy suggesting that the policy has reduced the number of total cases in Tennessee relative to what they would have been in the absence of the policy. The most important driver of these results is that it simultaneously appears that the open-testing policy has increased the number of tests while decreasing the number of confirmed cases -together, these form a strong piece of evidence that the policy has reduced total cases even though total cases are unobserved and it is hard to come up with reasonable assumptions that lead to point identification of the effect of the policy on total cases.

By May 6, Tennessee had moved somewhat ahead of Alabama in terms of per capita number of confirmed cases but was still behind both Georgia and Mississippi. It is also important to remember that the number of confirmed cases depends on the number of tests especially in cases like Covid-19 where the number of tests is relatively low and there may be a large number of asymptomatic cases or cases with relatively mild symptoms. Thus, for example, the increase in confirmed cases in Tennessee relative to Alabama could be explained by an increase in actual cases in Tennessee relative to Alabama or just due to a mechanical increase in the number of confirmed cases arising from more extensive testing.",

We do not do this in the current paper in order to mainly focus on the bounds arising from non-random testing. In the results presented below, in general, the bounds are not very sensitive to different reasonable values of the false negative rate of the test. More specifically, a higher false negative rate increases both the lower bound and the upper bound, but it increases the upper bound relatively more under Assumption 1 (see Equation (4) below); thus bounds tend to be somewhat wider (although the actual difference is small) under larger values of the false negative rate of the test. restriction on P (C ilt = 1|T ilt = 0) is that it is bounded between 0 and 1, then this will lead to extremely wide bounds on Covid-19 cases (essentially uninformative). Instead (and continuing to follow Manski and Molinari (2020)), we make the following assumption.",

Second, even in Tennessee where testing has been available to anyone who wants to take a test, (i) individuals expressing symptoms are still among those most likely to take the test and (ii) it seems likely that there is some self-selection into taking the test among individuals who think they may have Covid-19 even if they do not have the right combination of symptoms to otherwise warrant a test.

To be clear here, Assumption 3 does not imply that the unobserved number of total cases is exactly the same across counties in Tennessee and Alabama. Rather, it rules out things like systematic differences in unobserved total cases in the pre-treatment period for counties in Tennessee and Alabama with similar populations and that had run a similar number of tests and had confirmed a similar number of cases. Under these assumptions, we have the following result Proposition 1. Under Assumptions 2 and 3, AT T Y (Z lt * \u22121 ) and AT T Y are identified and givenby AT T Y (Z lt * \u22121 ) = E[Y lt * |Z lt * \u22121 , D l = 1] = E[Y lt * |Z lt * \u22121 , D l = 0] and AT T Y = E[AT T Y (Z lt * \u22121 )|D l = 1]The proof of Proposition 1 is in Appendix A.

These results are available in Panels (a) and (b) ofFigure 5. The results in that figure come from comparing the actual number of tests or confirmed cases for particular counties in Tennessee compared to their \"match\" county in Alabama. On average, the number of tests per capita increased by 21% in counties in Tennessee relative to what they would have experienced if they had not enacted the policy. 17 As discussed above, since we observe the full population, it does not seem appropriate to use conventional confidence intervals based on large samples from an infinite population. Instead, we consider the sharp null hypothesis that the number of tests in a particular county is exactly the same as it would be if the policy had not been enacted. Then, we can test if the policy is having an effect on the number of cases by computing the fraction of counties that have a higher number of tests than their matched county. Under this null (as well as the maintained assumptions), the distribution of this test statistic would be U [0, 1] and therefore we can treat this value as a p-value.

These results are provided inFigure 6. The lower bound on the policy effect is quite low -across counties, the average is a decrease of total cases by 95 per 1000individuals relative to what they would have been without the policy. This is probably a fairly unrealistically large effect as it occurs when no untested individuals in Tennessee have had Covid-19, but untested individuals in Alabama have the same probability of having Covid-19 as tested individuals.

If the number of confirmed cases is decreasing at the same time as the number of tests are increasing (which is what we find in the application), this is therefore a strong piece of evidence that Tennessee's policy is decreasing the total number of cases -even if we are not able to provide plausible assumptions that lead to point identification.",

Finally, only 22% of counties' upper bounds are greater than 0, and this can be interpreted as a randomization p-value for testing if the upper bound is equal to 0. Like the previous results, this is not statistically significant at conventional levels, but it is suggestive that Tennessee's policy is leading to fewer total cases. At a higher level, that the upper bound is negative is driven by the fact that confirmed cases appear to have decreased in Tennessee due to the open-testing policy.This decrease in confirmed cases in the presence of an increase in total tests is a strong piece of evidence that Tennessee's open-testing policy is decreasing the total number of cases.In this paper, we have considered the effects of Tennessee's open Covid-19 testing policy which increased the number and accessibility of tests in the state. Understanding the effect of this policy is substantially hampered by nonrandom testing. Our approach has been to combine standard policy evaluation identifying assumptions with additional, plausible assumptions that lead to bounds on the effect of the policy. Overall, we found suggestive evidence that Tennessee's policy has decreased the number of total and confirmed cases in Tennessee and was allowing workers to decrease their trips to work in counties that had experienced greater increases in their confirmed case count over time. In this sense, it seems that Tennessee's open-testing policy has benefited the state.Conditional on being able to increase the total number of tests, it is less clear if open-testingis, in some sense, optimal relative to other testing schemes. It seems that there are a number of tradeoffs here. Clearly, understanding the effects of the policy (as well as understanding things like the overall spread of Covid-19) would be greatly enhanced by random testing. On the other hand, more targeted testing could be useful for detecting outbreaks and protecting high risk groups.",
