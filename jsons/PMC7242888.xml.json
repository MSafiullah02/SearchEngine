There are generally two competing arguments on the supply sides of the global value chain; one promotes a further integration among members with a central supply from Asia (Gereffi 2014) and the other one is critical of the economic logic and rather promotes an ideological logic (Ahlstrom et al. 2020).",

The alternative, critical view of global integration rises above the economic logic and anchors on ideological conflicts between countries (e.g. the USA is considered a free-market economy and China is generally perceived to be a state-controlled economy) and promotes common political and social values unifying members of the global value chain. The latter view appears to dominate the discussion among policy-makers in Western countries after the pandemic outbreak. The governments including Japan, the USA, and the EU have started to introduce or at least discuss the stimulation policies to induce firms to retreat their value chains from China (Bermingham et al. 2020).",

However, a close examination of the supply of medical devices and pharmaceutical materials desperately needed in fighting against the virus by the world only found that this value chain was still heavily reliant on China.",

Key drivers to a resilient value (or supply) chain are agility, diversification, and interchangeability. The pandemic presses firms to re-evaluate their value chains, especially in knowledge-intensive and medical industries, and seek collaboration from the companies who they deem to be like-minded from an ideological perspective, and face a lesser political pressure from a state-controlled economy like China. There would be more AU&NZ firms who renew their focus on the USA, the UK, and other Western and emerging markets (such as India and ASEAN countries) as a natural response in building a resilient global value chain after the pandemic. This renewed focus is largely due to their risk avoidance (there are more political risks to sell to or source from China) and the increase of perceived importance of an institutional proximity in the global value chain. For example, Australian firm AVH has recently announced its intention to transfer listing from ASX to the US stock market to align with their strategic resources in the US market.",

In the foreseeable future, China will still likely hold the number one spot for the exports of primary products and food products from AU & NZ. In our view, it would be probably more realistic and strategically savvy if firms could start to embrace a \u201cdynamic balancing\u201d approach (Gao et al. 2018).",

A SME exporter\u2019s strategy of leveraging the capabilities of large intermediaries (e.g. those sourcing for FPH or RedMed) would likely achieve the breadth and flexibility in global supply chains and enable the exporter to balance markets and supplies effectively and efficiently.",

This does not mean that the AU or NZ business partners should hide their diversification strategy from their guanxi partners; rather the opposite, dancing with multiple partners in different guanxi networks is exactly what the intricacies and dynamics of guanxi balancing are all about.
