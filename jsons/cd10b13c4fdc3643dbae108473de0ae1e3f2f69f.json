It builds on Chap. 5's exploration of human security, including of health, beyond borders. It delves more deeply into the nuts and bolts of delivering the right to health by reallocating the responsibility for it across State border as well as between States and NSAs. Antecedent to its analysis is the acknowledgment of the tension between the morality of a universal human right to health and the claim to health care conferred by citizenship, focusing on the continued (r)evolution of the human right to health as part and parcel of human security, and of its practical feasibility beyond State borders.",

A main social target of governments, international organizations and the whole world community in the coming decades should be the attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. (Declaration of Alma-Ata 1978, paragraph V) This allocation of responsibility is repeated in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is also reiterated in the UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and UN General Assembly (UNGA) declarations pertaining to the international responses to the HIV and AIDS and Ebola epidemics (UNSC 2000; UNGA 2006 UNGA , 2011 UNSC 2014) . This trajectory highlights three points: first, that health is increasingly accepted as a universal right; second, that the international order as currently conceived and practiced holds national States responsible for the provision and protection of health security; and third, that non-citizens and cross-border coverage, prevention measures and eventually necessary intervention are not codified (see also Davies 2010; Davies et al. 2015) .",

Rather, there is only a relatively weak system of multilateral institutions built on the shaky foundations of the consent of sovereign states. (Frenk et al. 2014) Adding a further complication is the fact that these multilateral institutions, notably the WHO and its IHR (updated 2007), lack mandatory and effective implementation measures to ensure health security provisions if and when States fail to do so. Thus while States continue to assume the obligations of health security, they face constraints of both willpowerincluding their own-and capacity. Anyone who falls outside of the jurisdiction of State responsibility for health security 1 is left vulnerable-a vulnerability which can easily spread even to those who are 'secure' (Liotta and Owens 2006) . 2 The case of South Africa offers one illustration of this. South Africa espouses an ardent commitment to human rights and assumes the corresponding responsibilities in delivering these explicitly as per the Constitution.",

Owing an enormous debt to the African HIV and AIDS experience, little international resistance met the desperate cry for help. Admittedly, however, no medications were or have been forthcoming. 5 Nonetheless, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia accepted the theoretical responsibility for the health of their populations and took differing practical routes toward devising responses to their epidemics. Guinea, despite the presence and early warning of MSF, assumed responsibility for the epidemic response itself. Sierra Leone benefited from the external aid of the UK, and an influx of Cuban doctors, though it lost (too) many of its doctors and its one and only infectious disease expert. Liberia made headlines when President Sirleaf Johnson pleaded for assistance in an open letter. Her plea resulted not only in financial and NSA aid but, most controversially, in military deployments by a number of countries (the US, the UK, and Germany were involved), to build clinics and stem the spread of the Ebola epidemic. Whether these effects worked, or whether they were deployed as the tide of the epidemic was already turning, remains debated (Price-Smith 2009).",

Notably, it remains that first, the accountability for the given aid rests with the giver, not with the recipients: in other words, US (citizen) taxpayers can demand an accounting of the funds spent in West Africa since these are theirs, but West Africans cannot do the same although they were (to be) the beneficiaries of the monies, reinforcing the gap between the theory of sovereignty and citizenship divorced from the practical responsibility for health delivery; and second, notably given the uncertainty of the timing and effectiveness of the aid, it remains unclear what role such diplomatic and military aid had versus local interventions to end the Ebola epidemics.",

Indeed, health security is indisputably present on the international agenda (see UNSC; Trilateral Commission; G7; G20; European Council 2003) . (Axworthy 2001, 20) This diplomacy operates at the traditional, bilateral level of State-to-State relations wherein the security of population health is evaluated in the service of the security of the State. Yet it also involves NSAs and NGOs in efforts to elevate health on the international agenda in what Luk van Langenhove (2016) calls 'science for diplomacy'. Altogether, these trends and attendant initiatives have resulted in a proliferation of health security initiatives, spanning the whole range of State and human security definitions (Nunes 2014; Howell 2014; Mcinnes and Lee 2006; Kevany 2016; Kickbusch 2007) .

However, far from all countries around the world have established even one 'core capacity': the African IHR website is currently unavailable (5 September 2017) . Further crippling their effect is the IHR' lack of implementation tools, including sanction options if and when countries fail to comply and contribute. This endangers health security beyond their borders-as when an outbreak becomes an epidemic which becomes a pandemic as in the case of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The only incentive the IHR have is reputational: a country which complies with the requirements to notify the WHO of a suspected outbreak is spared public shaming and instead (ideally) rewarded with international acclaim for its forthright actions to protect international health security. When China failed to do so during the 2003 SARS epidemic, it was internationally condemned. When it did adhere to IHR guidelines during the H5N1 outbreak of 2005 and beyond, it was internationally lauded. Yet the IHR, like the EU decisions, rely on States to provide for health within their borders, and to enable other States to do the same in instances of cross-border penetration of disease outbreaks.

Though they have a role to play, they retain their liability both in their capacity undermining State sovereign capacity (see Matthews, 1997; \u0160ehovic\u0301 2015) and in their predetermined focus on select disease threats. They can, however, play an important role in highlighting emerging health security threats. They seem, for instance, to work anti-cyclically: when a State cannot or refuses to engage against a particular disease threat, NSAs might fill the void (Risse 2012; Keck and Sikkink 1998) . When the State assumes its responsibility, NSAs might dissipate. The risk remains in the (un)avoidable gap: when NSAs shift their focus onto other risks or threats and States fail to step in and take over their security guarantee (\u0160ehovic\u0301 2014). For example, as the HIV epidemic burgeoned in South Africa in the late 1990s to early 2000s, any response lay mostly in the hands of NSAs, including NGOs, civil society, and the business community and private industry (\u0160ehovic\u0301 2014). As the State assumed greater responsibility for treatment and care, many of these NSAs shifted their focus elsewhere. This worked as long as not another massive (health) demand overburdened the State's capacity to respond. Now, in 2017, South Africa faces a skyrocketing number of TB, including MDR and XDR, cases, as well as a surge in drugresistant HIV infections. 6 As during the early days of HIV, NSAs are providing much of the care and support. 7 This time, however, there is little likelihood of the South African State stepping in, let alone to the extent that it did with HIV, again. 8 That TB is airborne and therefore able to cross borders even more readily than HIV, affecting sedentary and migratory populations alike, should elevate the argument that removing myopia on borders and disease is all the more critical to imagining health security beyond borders. Some imagining is being done and put into practice. Adding to GOARN, the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) is expanding the net of disease outbreak inputs to include NSAs. By ignoring geographical lines and circumventing governmental border surveillance, it is able to garner more precise data. However, as seen above, most of these initiatives hit a State-backed wall with regard to either information access or decision-making procedure. Furthermore, the boundaries between citizen and non-citizen plague equitable access to protections and provisions of health security which would benefit all persons and parties, including States. Yet without implementation, authorizations, and capabilities similarly across borders, the information falls on deaf ears of closed decisionmaking rooms whose access is restricted to disinterested or disinclined States, despite an eventual reputational cost (see also Weir and Mykhalovskiy, in Bashford 2006; Davies et al. 2015) .",

In this instance, it might be to have national States, as Member States of the UNSC and the WHO, sign preemptive agreements which foresee military intervention in the event that civilian actors, both national and non-State, invoke the need. The trouble with the WHO is that it is politically constrained; it must obtain governments' permission to work in their territory, as in Liberia. Therefore, such preliminary agreements directly between States and, for instance, a coalition of signatories to the FCGH might be useful on two counts in securing health and human security: first, to accelerate investment in civilian capacity could forestall the need for such an intervention having to be invoked; second, by establishing a priori which foreign militaries might come to the aid of which nations, for how long, and under what conditions. This might also prevent the national or international abuse of States of emergency or uninvited military intervention in the name of 'security' (\u0160ehovic\u0301 2016).",

(Davies et al. 2015) In order for any of these strategies to be successful, however, not only action but also accountability is required. As States remain the entities at which both human security per se and its provision and protection rest, the onus is on them to respond. This ups the ante for any response, for States to be seen 'doing something' (Davies et al. 2015, 123) . The challenge then is not to equate 'doing something' as opposed to nothing with doing anything, but to customize the response to render it timely and effective. Such effectiveness is in turn predicated upon coordination, at the national, international, and global levels.",

Such a strategy would also enable the European and German offices to link with others, such as the US Global Health Security Initiative and the State Department's health diplomacy desk, both launched in 2009, at the bilateral level.

As such, it focuses mostly on inter-State coordination. As argued above, this has two shortcomings based on the assumption that States are the final guarantor of human and thus of health security. First, States may or may not be able to meet their obligations toward human security. Second, they may actively neglect or even pursue aims contrary to the provision of human and health security. Particularly at risk are non-citizens. The ensuring gap cannot be filled by NSAs alone. Likewise, military intervention without prior coordination is a risky strategy with unproven (long-term) repercussions for the health and human security of both sedentary and migrant populations on all sides of borders to which it remains unaccountable. Consequently, a new global ordering of health and human security responsibilities premised on State but capturing non-State actions toward its realization is vitally necessary.",
