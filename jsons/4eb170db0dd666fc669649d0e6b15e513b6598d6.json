Operationally, health workers and surveillance teams treated cases, collected genetic samples, and tracked case contacts. Despite the substantial progress in analyzing and modeling EBOV epidemiological data, a complete characterization of the spatiotemporal spread of Ebola cases remains a challenge. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on the EBOV epidemic that utilizes virus genome sequences to inform population-level, spatial models. Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages, these dynamic spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV in Sierra Leone. Further, we developed a model selection framework that identifies important epidemiological variables influencing the spatiotemporal propagation of EBOV. Consistent with other investigations, our results show that the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the epidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our analysis also revealed a substantial decline in the dependence on population size at the end of the epidemic, coinciding with the large-scale intervention campaign: Operation Western Area Surge. More generally, we believe this framework, pairing molecular diagnostics with dynamic models, has the potential to be a powerful forecasting tool along with offering operationally-relevant guidance for surveillance and sampling strategies during an epidemic.",

Advances in genetic sequencing and epidemiological modeling 1 have promised a revolution in producing near real-time forecasts for the spread of an emerging epidemic 2 , monitoring of an endemic disease 3 , and eradicating a disease 4, 5 . However, despite the prominent role mathematical and statistical modeling played in inferring dynamic EBOV epidemic parameters from case and genetic data 6, 7 , there has been a significant delay in the characterization of the spatiotemporal spread. The design of operationally-relevant, spatially-distributed interventions will require the identification of predictive models that are able to assimilate and adapt to case and genetic data.",

The spatial model is then coupled to a disease transmission model 17 . Alternatively, molecular data sets offer direct insight into disease mobility. This genetic data has been used to construct distance-dependent spatial models for West Nile virus in North America 18 and Dengue in Thailand 19 .

Further, sampled virus genome sequences and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis have also indicated that population and distance are factors that influence EBOV spatial spread 22 . However, the World Health Organization (WHO) response team reached a contrasting and dire conclusion: the spread of the epidemic was unpredictable 23 . Here, we present an investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the West African EBOV epidemic with the primary goal of quantifying the underlying drivers of spatial spread such as the size of and distance between population centers.

Paired with advances in phylogenetics that identify linkages between cases 5 , virus genome data offers powerful insight into spatiotemporal, transmission events. Specifically, these linkages in combination with geographic and demographic characteristics help infer the parameters of the gravity and L\u00e9vy flight models.

Therefore, the transmission events do not match a uniform random process on the driving network. We also examined the impact of subsampled events during the epidemic for fitting a power law model. By randomly drawing a similar number of samples from the inferred model, the fit is robust to the number of samples collected during the epidemic; see Figure S6 and Supplement. The observed distribution of d ij is closely related to a power law for a significant portion of the distribution, shown in Figure S6 . However, there are clear differences between the idealized power law model and the distribution of d ij that suggest the influence of other factors such as population size. C. Gravity model at epidemic peak was driven by Freetown Inferring the parameters of the gravity model with the genetic linkage data, population was found to be an important variable in characterizing spatial transmission events, especially in stage II of the epidemic when the Western Area is involved in 244 of the 363 genetic linkages. In stage II, the MLE of the gravity model parameters found \u03c4 2 = 1.2 \u00b1 0.3 and \u03c1 = 0.9 \u00b1 0.5 with a 95% confidence interval; see Figure S7 for more detail on the MLE calculation. The likelihood landscapes, with varying (\u03c1, \u03c4 2 ), are shown in Figure 3D for stages I-III. Values of the log-likelihood for each stage and both models are shown in Figure S9 . The likelihood ratio, comparing the gravity and power law models during stage II, indicated a strong preference for gravity shown in Figure 1F . Further, Figure 3B illustrates that the POTN for stage II contains a significant number of transmission events in the Western Area of Sierra Leone supporting the population-dependent model. When setting the population parameter \u03c4 2 to the canonical value of 1, the gravity model was still preferred over the power-law for this portion of the epidemic. Figure 1E illustrates gravity and power law models as chiefdom-level maps of Sierra Leone with Freetown as the origin of a virus genome. The stage II virus sequence data was consistent with a destination-population gravity model dominated by Freetown linkages.",

A wide variety of probabilistic models can be proposed to describe the stochastic spatial process underlying disease transmission during an epidemic. For this study, we posited two parsimonious models, wellknown in the epidemiology and ecology literature, to investigate the influence of population and distance on the spatial spread of cases. We discovered that the stochastic propagation of cases is best described by a probabilistic gravity model where dependence on the population and distance varies over the course of the epidemic. The gravity model was preferred in the early part of the epidemic when EBOV was circulating near cities in the east of Sierra Leone. Once the virus migrated to more densely populated areas of the capital area, such as Freetown, Kenema, and Port Loko, the gravity model preference became much stronger. During this portion of the epidemic, the transmission events were highly local with a large proportion of linkages staying between large population centers. This observation is also consistent with recent studies of the superspreader phenomenon in the Western Area 40, 44 .",

This population influence changed over the course of the EBOV epidemic. In fact, after March 2015, the population dependence diminished significantly. This suggests that EBOV mobility can be accurately modeled as a spatial process dependent solely on distance. The MLE of the parameters for the gravity model showed a large uncertainty in the population exponent \u03c4 2 . Further, the fitted distance exponent was \u03c1 < 1, which indicates a higher probability of larger distances between linked cases. In the pure power law model, the disease mobility during this period has a L\u00e9vy flight exponent of order \u03b1 = \u03c1 \u2212 1 = 0.6, suggesting a space-fractional diffusion process. This result is consistent with the observation that confirmed EBOV cases decreased in the large cities of the West-ern Area and appeared sporadically in less populated areas far from the Western Area after March 2015. Further, this shift away from a strong preference for a gravity model coincided with an intervention campaign by the government of Sierra Leone called Operation Western Area Surge (OWAS) that occurred on 2014-12-17 45 . This suggests a successful intervention as urbanites modified their behavior. Observations after the OWAS indicate an increase in health center avoidance, return trips to home villages, and transmission away from population centers 46 .

In Figure S3(A) , the likelihood ratio is plotted for: all linkages, only the shortest linkages for each ancestor-descendant pair, a 30-day maximum for linkage duration, and 60-day maximum for duration. Panel (A) kept the gravity model parameters fixed during the time-course at values (\u03c1 = 1.6, \u03c4 2 = 1). Qualitatively, all of the likelihood traces under these assumptions are similar. Figure S3 (B) illustrates a similar calculation, but the gravity model parameters were set according to their MLE values (\u03c1 , \u03c4 2 ) computed in each 50-day window. In general, the same trends for the likelihood ratio regardless of upper bound on linkage duration are observed. When the linkages are pruned to the shortest durations, the likelihood ratio ceases to be statistically significant (p = 0.05) at t = 350 days when using \u03c1 = 1.6 and \u03c4 2 = 1. However, the pruned result remains significant until t = 425 days when using the MLE for the gravity parameters for each window. The loss of significance in the p-value always occurs when fewer than 50 linkages are observed in a time window. This suggests a number of genomes that need to be collected during an epidemic to calibrate these spatial models with statistical significance for the desired time window. We had access to both the summary of sequenced EBOV genomes 22 and confirmed cases of EBOV infection 24 from Sierra Leone. We compared the number of sequenced and confirmed cases for each district by stage of the epidemic (0-150 days, 150-300 days, and 300-550 days). A summary of this comparison is shown in Figure S4 and Table S1 . The area of each red circle represents the number of sequenced genomes whereas the area of each black circle represents the number of confirmed cases. For some districts, nearly all the cases were sequenced. In Bo and Bombali districts during the last stage, more cases were sequenced than confirmed. The extra Bombali sequence is due to an earlier cutoff in the confirmed case dates. The extra Bo sequence may be due to a difference in collection protocol and labeling. Overall, the sequenced cases track the confirmed cases proportionally across districts. However, there is a saturation in the number of sequenced genomes in stage II. No more than 100 genomes were sequenced in any single district. The difference between sequenced and confirmed cases was largest when nearly 2000 cases were confirmed in Western Urban district. However, we note that this does not change the qualitative conclusion for the preference of the gravity model in stage II. In fact, if more genomes had been sequenced in the Western Urban, the gravity model would likely be even more strongly preferred. Table S1 . The smallest circles in this visualization, in Bonthe during stage I for example, indicate zero observed cases.",

Additionally, we simulated a uniform distribution by aggregating driving distances between all pairs of chiefdoms. The distribution of d ij is closer to a power law than a uniform distribution according to the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. This statistic, D n , measures the distance between two probability distributions, such that D n = 0 for equivalent distributions. The value of D n is 10 \u2212 25% smaller for the power law than for the uniform distribution across 1000 subsamples of N = 656 driving distances.

When distances are measured on a discrete, politically-defined topology, there are complex effects on the distance distribution due to national borders and heterogeneity in the size of administrative divisions. An important future research direction is investigating interpretable bounds on an empirical distance distribution for models defined on realistic spatial topologies. For example, the gravity model has been modified in 16 to allow for piecewise assortative mixing based on distances. ",

We show the time-course of these estimates with 95% confidence intervals for the three stages of the epidemic in Figure S7 . We see both MLE values shrink, indicating a drop in the importance of chiefdom population size and an increase in the relative number of long d ij . Since the uncertainty in these parameters is fairly large, we also studied the results of fixed parameter values (\u03c1 = 1.6, \u03c4 2 = 1) for the gravity model.

If a sequence had neither chiefdom nor district information, it was excluded from the analysis. We examined the sensitivity of our results to this assumption by recomputing the likelihood ratio for the minimum, mean, and maximum chiefdom population. Figure S8 illustrates the likelihood ratio for each of the population assumptions. We observed the same general trend in likelihood ratio: the gravity model is strongly preferred at the peak of the epidemic; the preference for the gravity model quickly fades toward the latter part of the epidemic after Operation Western Area Surge. Before 125 days, most chiefdoms are known in the data so the various assumptions do not change the result. However, there are subtle differences in the second and third stages of the epidemic. Comparing the minimum and maximum population, the power law model is statistically preferred for a longer period of the epidemic when using the minimum population. Conversely, the maximum population shows the gravity model strongly preferred for the entire epidemic. Note that this is consistent with our understanding of the probabilistic gravity and power law model. By choosing the maximum population chiefdom, we are biasing the result toward a population dependent model. Conversely, by choosing the minimum, we are biasing the result away from gravity and toward the distance-dependent power-law model. Importantly though, the qualitative trends in the likelihood ratio are robust to these population assumptions. Here, the gravity model parameters are fixed at (\u03c1 = 1.6, \u03c42 = 1) and \u03c1 = 1.6 in the power law model.",

            "text": "Virus genomes with unknown chiefdom localization were assigned the median population of the known district. This population assignment was implemented because of three main reasons: i) the confirmed case data shows that the maximum populated chiefdom is usually more than twice as populous as the mean population; ii) the mean and median population approximations provide similar results for the likelihood ratio, seen in Figure S8 ; and iii) the calculation of a discrete d ij requires a specific chiefdom, which is not possible when using the mean value. Population approximations at the chiefdom level for the virus genome data can be compared to the localization metadata for the confirmed cases 24 . We computed the mean chiefdom population for confirmed cases by district in the three stages of the epidemic, shown in Table S2 . We also describe the percentage of total confirmed cases by district in Table S2 . The mean chiefdom population in each district changes throughout the epidemic since the set of chiefdoms with confirmed cases varies, except in the Western Area. For Western Urban, there is only one Admin-3 geographic shape in our database. Western Rural does not have Admin-3 level resolution from the metadata for confirmed cases. In stage I of the epidemic, for the two districts with the most confirmed cases, the mean chiefdom population is 93% of the maximum value in Kenema and 54% of the maximum value in Kailahun. In stage I, we found that the virus genome and confirmed case data are consistent indicating that cases appear in chiefdoms with populations closer to the maximum. However, in stage II and III when the virus genomes do not have chiefdom localization, we see that the observed mean population for confirmed cases is typically half the maximum chiefdom population in each district, shown in Table S2 . The likelihood ratio, R, is computed for a set of virus genome linkages S. Here, we consider three separate sets of linkages corresponding to the sequenced cases in the three stages of the epidemic. The normalized log-likelihood ratio of a gravity model to a L\u00e9vy flight model is: R(\u03c1, \u03c4 2 ) = S [ln(p G ij ) \u2212 ln(p L ij )]/ \u221a N , where N is the number of linkages in S. We used the MLE of the parameters for both the gravity and L\u00e9vy flight models. In Figure S9 , the likelihood is computed for each individual linkage for both models. For each stage, the log-likelihoods at ln(0.5) = \u22120.69 correspond to stationary linkages. Figure S9 illustrates the relative likelihood evaluation between models for each sequence providing insight into the likelihood ratio calculation. ",
