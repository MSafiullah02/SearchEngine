            "text": "For verification purposes, it is usually enough to search for one instance, which either proves or disproves the property of interest. However, for testing and validation purposes several instances are usually required to increase our confidence in the correctness of the model. It is highly desirable that those instances exhibit diversity, i.e., distinct configurations of the system and interesting corner cases [11] . Lack of diversity may make validation and testing more time consuming, as the analysis includes almost-duplicate instances that do not provide added value; and less effective, as the sample of instances may fail to include relevant scenarios. Nevertheless, most model finders focus on efficiency and expressiveness of the input modeling notation, so few of them ensure diversity of the generated instances [6, 11, 20, 23, 26] . In these few, diversity assurance is integrated into the solver: it guides the search process to look for diverse instances. However, this integration makes it harder to transfer the proposed methods to other solvers and notations. Thus, designers are limited in terms of expressiveness (e.g., no support for integer or string attributes [11, 20, 26] or dynamic properties [6, 11, 23, 24] ) and cannot benefit from additional features provided by others model finders (e.g., computation of minimal instances [16] or support for max-satisfiability [28] ). This paper proposes a method for distilling diverse instances in the model finder output based on the use of clustering. Instances are classified into categories according to their similarity, which is calculated using information about their structure (the existing objects and the links between them), typing (the specific type of each object) and attribute values. This calculation is based on the use of graph kernels, a family of methods for computing distances among graphs. Selecting a representative instance from each category ensures diversity while reducing testing and validation time, as redundant instances can be safely discarded. As a drawback, this method does not force the model finder to look for diverse instances, it only distills the most diverse ones.",

Thus, the name of the owner could be abstracted away in our graph representation, i.e. remove from the graph the vertices related to this particular attribute. On the other hand, focusing on the balance of an account, we might be interested in considering accounts with a positive, negative and zero balance. In this case, we are not interested in specific values for the balance, only if they fit in these three categories.

This label is constructed iteratively: each iteration i computes the label for the tree of height i rooted in each node v (label(i, v)). Iteration 0 (line 11) uses the original labels in the graph.

The experiments have been performed on a quad-core Intel i5-760 2.8 GHz with 4 GB of RAM. On the software side, we have used Java 9.0.4 64 bits and R 3.50 64 bits.

Then, we describe the time (in milliseconds) required by Alloy to compute the instances (Model finding), compared to the time taken by the different steps of our method: graph abstraction (Abst), graph kernel (Kern) and clustering (Clust). The total time for the three steps is reported as well. Finally, we list the optimal number of clusters (# Cl) identified by our method and the silhouette coefficient (Sil). As mentioned in Sect. 5, the silhouette is a value in the [\u22121,+1] range that estimates the quality of the clustering (higher is better). Considering these results, regarding RQ1 (efficiency) the execution time of the method is always below 0.5 seconds and less than the time required by Alloy to compute the instances. This was somewhat expected, as the computational effort of our approach depends on the number of instances and their size, but it is unaffected by the hardness of finding instances, the decisive factor in Alloy's execution time.

First, it defines a feature vector encoding for object diagrams that captures, for each object, information about attribute values and adjacent objects. And second, it defines a centrality metric (similar to the pagerank algorithm of search engines) that measures the importance of each object within the object diagram. Compared to our method, this approach is specific for object diagrams: it cannot deal with features from other modeling notations, such as Alloy's relations or witnesses. Furthermore, the proposed similarity metrics do not consider information about types, structure and attribute values simultaneously: the centrality metric omits attribute values entirely; and the feature vector approach does not consider topological information about the structure of the object diagram.",

These type of models could be used for validation and testing, and thus they are the target of the proposed method.
