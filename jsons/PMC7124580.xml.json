            "text": "The early protection mechanism of the host against infection, trauma or other tissue damage comprises a set of reactions known as the acute phase response (APR). One of its main features is hepatic production of acute phase proteins (APPs) [1]. Determination of APPs provides a tool for evaluating inflammatory response of the host during infections. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in beef and dairy calves. Respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease, caused by a variety of aetiological agents. Environmental and husbandry factors and impaired resistance of predisposed calves to the infections are involved. APPs can potentially be used to investigate the complex pathogenesis of BRD and to evaluate the role of aetiological factors. However, more information about the synthesis pattern of APPs during natural BRD infections of calves is needed.",

However, only limited data are available on APPs as disease markers of spontaneous BRD. These studies have mainly been conducted to evaluate the potential of APPs as individual or herd health diagnostic tools in veterinary practice. Wittum et al. [8] and Young et al. [9] found that bovine APP haptoglobin (Hp) had limited capacity as a diagnostic clinical tool for BRD in feedlot cattle. Later, Hp was considered useful for identifying beef calves with BRD needing treatment and for monitoring treatment efficacy [10], [11], [12], whereas serum amyloid A (SAA) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was not found to be a useful marker of BRD in feedlot calves [10], [11].",

These calves were initially included in the study to investigate the effects of age on the physiological concentrations of APPs and were blood-sampled weekly without any other manipulation. Calves were housed in two group fences (calves nos. 1\u20135 in one and the rest in the other) with an automatic milk feeding system (one nipple for each fence) with milk powder and free access to water, silage and hay. After weaning (approximately at the age of 8 weeks), calves were moved into a group fence with older calves. The first calves were weaned and moved between sampling weeks 4 and 5, after disappearance of the clinical BRD signs. All fences were located in close proximity to each other.

Increased values of sensitive APPs (SAA and LBP) on weeks 1 and 3, and the highest concentrations of Hp on week 3 also emphasize the two-stage nature of the inflammatory response. The first inflammatory reaction, reflected as an increase in SAA and LBP concentrations at week 1, is probably a response to the BRS virus. The subsequent more pronounced elevation of SAA, LBP and especially Hp is likely a sign of a secondary bacterial infection. Heegaard et al. [2] reported a biphasic response of SAA and Hp after BRSV challenge in one calf, possibly caused by secondary infection with Pasteurella avium, which was found at necropsy. In the same study, high SAA responder calves to the virus challenge had a subsequent Hp rise, but medium and low SAA responders did not show a Hp response. This suggests that Hp response requires more profound tissue damage, which is more likely to occur in bacterial infection. This is supported also by a field study of Humblet et al. [12], where Hp was found to be a good marker to detect calves with BRD that requiring antibacterial and anti-inflammatory treatment. In our study, the two calves treated with antibiotics at week 3 both had higher Hp concentrations at that time. A synergistic effect of BRSV and bacteria was observed in the present study. There were more bacterial species involved in microbial growth in TBL samples taken around the middle of the outbreak than in samples taken after clinical manifestation (Table 1). P. multocida was most likely responsible for the more enhanced responses of APPs in the later stages of BRD. The only calf that had no P. multocida infection at week 2 had a minor increase of SAA and LBP concentrations (at week 1), no increase of Hp concentrations and the lowest clinical response (at week 2). In our previous study [27], P. multocida infection was related to high concentrations of all APPs investigated (SAA, Hp, LBP, AGP, fibrinogen) in calves with BRD.",

These differences in APP response patterns could be explained by different onset of infection. However, calves from both groups had similar SAA, LBP and clinical responses at week 1, and BRS virus findings at week 2 were comparable (2 from low-response and 3 from high-response groups; Table 1). There was a similar distribution of antibody response groups calves between the two fences, and one nipple of the automatic feeder in the fence possibly assisted the quick spread of the virus. Because this was not a controlled infection, we cannot confirm that all calves received the virus infection at a similar dosage and at the same time, but our results suggest that the initial onset of infection probably happened over a relatively short timeframe. Also, comparable bacterial growth was detected in the calves of both groups (Table 1); thus, the triggering agents for secondary infection were available. Neither immaturity of the immune system of younger calves (similar age distribution in groups) nor the presence of maternal antibodies against BRSV (no detectable IgG1 at week 0) can explain this. One possible explanation is that calves with lower humoral immune response to the BRSV were unable to efficiently remove virus despite inflammatory response and were more susceptible to subsequent secondary bacterial infections. Calves with good antibody production, by contrast, were more efficiently able to mount a protective inflammatory response to clear the virus and present secondary bacterial infections or the viral antibodies were able to protect the respiratory epithelium against bacterial adherence. The mechanisms by which viruses can alter host susceptibility to a secondary bacterial infection by altering environmental conditions and suppressing the respiratory defence systems are numerous and complex [30]. One of these mechanisms is enhanced adherence of bacteria to virus-infected respiratory cells due to viral glycoprotein expression. Bartelt and Duncan [31] suggested that a protein receptor is needed for adherence of bacteria because treatment of cells with trypsin reduced bacteria binding. Glycoprotein G has been found to increase Neisseria meningitis binding in RSV-infected human epithelial cells [32], and a weak antibody response to RSV infection has been noted in children because of their low production of protective antibodies against glycoproteins [33]. A study in which antibodies to human influenza A virus protected cells from streptococcal adherence [34] further supports the hypothesis that early and sufficient production of antibodies to the virus may have protected calves from exacerbated bacterial infection. However, T-cell responses [35] along with the production of specific IgG2, IgA and virus-neutralizing antibodies [36] also have important roles in immune response to BRSV infection, and we cannot argue solely in favour of specific IgG1 production since we have not measured other immune functions.",

In our previous study, where we used calves from the same farm in exactly the same conditions, we show how age affects concentrations of APPs [37]. Generally, concentrations of SAA, LBP and AGP were at the highest during the first 2 weeks of life, decreased afterwards and then stabilized around at 3\u20134 weeks. This age effect explains the high values of SAA, LBP and AGP at week 0 and the decreasing change in concentrations of AGP between week 0 and 1. SAA and LBP concentrations increased in the same time, indicating the presence of inflammatory stimulus and not the effect of age. We also controlled age along with treatment of two calves in our statistical models, to avoid possible confounder effect.",

They are more sensitive markers than evaluation of clinical response, especially when clinical disease is not very severe, as in this study. An early increase in response to viral infection and a marked rise in the secondary bacterial infection even when only mild or moderate clinical signs of BRD are present, make SAA and LBP the best candidates for this purpose. In the same time, parallel measuring of the Hp response can be valuable to improve the evaluation of the severity of inflammation.",
