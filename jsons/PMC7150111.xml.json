Increasing number of humanitarian crisis situations are happening due to natural (owing to global warming, climatic change, and natural geographic processes) as well as global sociopolitical scenario with rising number of unresolved conflicts, economic turmoils, and international disputes (The World Economic Forum, 2019). Hence, health professional's response to humanitarian crisis have evolved as a permanent feature of the global health-care scene. Pharmacists as the essential member of health-care team, are incorporated in the health system network globally, also including their presence in the emergency conditions. The role of pharmacist is transforming globally to patient-centered approach. Similarly, in emergency medicine, pharmacists have not only struggled to advance their role in the logistic management but also focussed on rationality and safety, in accordance with the needs of the population.",

Another important role for ED pharmacist is to rationalize the procedures to obtain antidote from national stock in case of insufficient supplies available in the local emergency centers. ED pharmacist can provide antidote in case of bioterrorism event and can effectively participate in actions concerned with prophylaxis, treatment, and counseling.

The project has wide application and was tested for its use during the Syrian refugee crisis when a number of immigrants who were non-English speaking women, children, and elderly reached Europe. The software is called PictoRx and the Arabic version was added to the software in 2015 to help the refugees. The previously available languages included English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Maori, German, Chinese, and Polish. PictoRx software is used to aid local pharmacists in routine dispensing by ensuring that patients receiving the medicines are provided with the proper counseling using pictograms and printed labels. It has been tested in several communities across the globe, including Germany, the recipient of largest number of Syrian refugees. The project has been granted WHO Grant on Patient Safety in 2010 and the 2009 Canada Post Community Literacy Award. An improved version of the software is developed by Applied Research and Innovation at the Algonquin College, O Ottawa, Canada. The software is available as online or offline version from the home page (www.fip.org/pictograms, https://www.fip.org/pictogramsoftware). The software provides printable material and labels for use as the counseling aids to the patient. Various modalities are provided in the software to provide comprehensive medicine information to the patient in the form of an information sheet as well as prescription calendar, which incorporates several medicines for a patient at one place (Vaillancourt et al., 2012).",
