They provide direct first-line care to patients, and are the health care professionals who spend the longest contact time with patients. Previous studies have pointed out that nursing work involves long working hours, highly stressful working environments (Chou et al., 2014), potential hazardous substances in the workplace (bacteria, viruses, and radiation), and shift work. This implies that nursing staff work for long periods in high-risk working environments (Gershon et al., 2007; Wang and Li, 2015), and are concerned about having a positive work environment, which may explain the nursing practice rate of only 59% in Taiwan (Taiwan Union of Nurses Association, 2017); this rate is significantly lower than the 84% in the US in 2012 (Juraschek et al., 2012) and 91% in Canada in 2016 (College of Nurses of Ontario, 2016). In 1995, Taiwan began implementing National Health Insurance, and the insured population coverage reached 99.6% in 2017 (National Health Insurance Administration, 2017). According to 2015 statistics, there were over 22 million hospitalizations (including emergency departments) and the visiting rate was 94,219 visits per 100,000 population (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2016a,b); thus, the right to equal medical treatment was achieved. However, after the overall hospital budget system was established, each hospital started to adopt various flexible labor measures to control costs and reduce nursing staff, which increased nursing workloads (Kao, 2011; Liang et al., 2010) and led to a deteriorating working environment, such as higher nurse-patient ratios of 1:7-16 (Taiwan Union of Nurses Association, 2016). It is a significant concern whether nursing staff are at high risk from disease due to occupational specificity and working environment.",

Most of the above studies used questionnaire surveys and focused on a single health issue. Their advantage is that they enable an in-depth understanding of the issue; however, the sample size was often too small and participants were limited to one region. On the other hand, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) has a coverage of more than 99%, which includes the health information of almost all citizens; therefore, the possibility of selection bias is greatly reduced. Moreover, the Taiwan NHIRD is an actual visiting record, which does not involve subjective data obtained from individuals\u2019 memories and answers. Therefore, the use of this database can avoid recall/information bias, which is common in sampling, interviews, and surveys. Thus, this study used the Taiwan NHIRD to investigate and compare hospitalization risk between nursing staff and the general population.",

            "text": "As patients must undergo 24 h of continuous care when they are hospitalized, clinical nursing staff must rotate in three shifts. Shift work is a common source of stress and may have a significant physiological and psychological impact, which can lead to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases (Colquhoun et al., 2013) and increase the risk of stroke (Brown et al., 2009). Vetter et al. (2016) carried out a prospective cohort study on 189,158 healthy female nursing staff in a 24-year follow up, and found that the number of years of shift work was highly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Staff who have worked shifts for long periods are also prone to having health problems, i.e., overweight or obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes (Canuto et al., 2013). Nursing staff are also a high-risk population for occupational stress and workplace fatigue (Lu et al., 2014). Their occupational stress originates from excessive workload, patients\u2019 aggressive behavior, shift work, low social support, stress due to further education, and financial status (Lim et al., 2010). The increase in patient-to-nurse ratio further exacerbates the situation. The Taiwan Union of Nurses Association (2016) pointed out that in 2015, the average nurse-patient ratios in health care institutions in Taiwan were 7\u201310 in the morning shift, 13\u201314 in the afternoon shift, and 13\u201316 in the night shift, which is higher than the 5.2 in Norway, 6.9 in Ireland, and 8.8 in the UK (Aiken et al., 2014).",

For instance, workplace fatigue may increase the rates of needle-stick injury and medication administration errors, endanger the lives of patients, increase absence rates from work, and decrease work satisfaction (Lu et al., 2014). Nursing staff are also required to stand for long periods, move patients or heavy objects, collect samples (e.g., blood collection), and input data into computers. These tasks involve repetitive waist, hand, and shoulder movements that may cause nursing staff to become a high-risk population for musculoskeletal injuries (Davis and Kotowski, 2015). To summarize the above literature, the work characteristics of nursing are a predominance of shift work, a heavy workload, and exposure to an environment with a high risk of occupational injury (e.g., needle-stick and musculoskeletal injury). They may affect nurses\u2019 sleep, digestion, metabolic and cardiovascular systems, mental health, and the likelihood of developing cancer.",

We used the methodology of Lin et al. (2008) to further explore the hospitalization risk of nursing staff. Generally, most studies examining healthcare utilization behavior have adopted the behavior model of health service utilization proposed by Aday and Andersen (1974). This model has eight dimensions: type of utilization, site of medical care, purpose, time interval for a visit, health policies, healthcare delivery system, consumer satisfaction, and characteristics of population at risk. Our study defined hospitalization risk measurement indicators as follows: (1) Purpose of hospitalization: the ICD-9-CM code was used for the classification of disease and injury diagnosis (Table 1\n); (2) Hospitalization rate: number of hospitalizations and length of hospitalization in days; (3) Site of hospitalization: whether the site of hospitalization was a medical center or a regional, district, or primary hospital.",

In May 2015, South Korea experienced a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, and a total of 186 people were confirmed to be infected by July 2015, of which 31 (17%) were health care professionals (Ki, 2015). Therefore, a possible reason for the higher incidence of respiratory diseases in nursing staff compared with the general public is that once patients with respiratory diseases are hospitalized, clinical nursing staff are the first-line health care professionals caring for them. As nursing staff are exposed to a sealed and infection-prone environment, their probability of being infected is many times higher than that of the general population.",

The types of cancer with a significantly higher risk for nursing staff than for the general population included breast cancer (SIR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.19\u20131.37), thyroid cancer (SIR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10\u20131.43), lung cancer and mediastinal tumors (SIR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.13\u20131.62), and uterine cancer (SIR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.01\u20131.49). A possible reason for the inconsistency between our study results and those of Shen et al. (2013) could be that our study used the hospitalization medical costs file to assess hospitalization risk. In cancer patients, however, their treatment may not necessarily require hospitalization, as outpatient follow-up treatment can be provided, resulting in a disparity in the results.",

However, previous studies have pointed out that nurses are a high-risk population for musculoskeletal diseases because of their job characteristics. A possible reason for this inconsistency may be that the present study mainly focused on hospitalization risk, while studies have pointed out that musculoskeletal diseases in nursing staff are mainly neck, shoulder, and lower back pain, and wrist discomfort (Wang et al., 2015), which are usually treated in outpatient follow-up.",

On the other hand, the length of hospitalization for the general population was 9.94 days (10.49 days for males and 9.49 days for females). This shows that the average length of hospitalization among nursing staff was lower than in the general population. Possible reasons for this are the fact that nursing staff possess professional nursing knowledge and will seek efficient treatments, as well as the potential effects of the \u201chealthy worker effect\u201d (in other words, when workers are hired, their physical health must be relatively good; thus, they have lower morbidity and mortality rates than the general public [Kirkeleit et al., 2013]), which increases hospitalization care efficiency and decreases the length of hospitalization. On the other hand, the average length of hospitalization in Taiwan (9.84 days) is higher than that in the US (5.50 days) (OECD, 2017).This impacts the intensity of care required and subsequent nursing caseload.",

However, as this was an administrative database, the integrity of the data content could not be completely controlled. This is the main study limitation. In addition, (1) in terms of work experience, the career mobility of the nursing profession in Taiwan is high and nursing staff often change their workplace; therefore, we were unable to investigate the correlation between work experience and hospitalization risk; (2) Due to limitations in data variables, we were unable to carry out further examination of the association of occupational fatigue in nursing staff from different departments (such as intensive care units, operating theaters, anesthesiology departments, and wards) and shift work with hospitalization risk.",

            "text": "A total of 33,267 numbers of nursing staff in Taiwan were hospitalized between 2011 and 2013. After controlling for gender, calendar year, and age, female nursing staff showed a significantly higher hospitalization risk compared to the general population for infectious and parasitic diseases, diseases of the respiratory system, complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. This may be associated with the job characteristics and environment of nursing staff; therefore, we propose the following recommendations: (1) Infectious diseases: Periodic X-ray examinations with good risk exposure monitoring for high-risk nursing staff (taking account of potential harm and benefit, e.g. risk for cancer), implementation of infection control in on-job training education, provision of comprehensive protective equipment, and correct wearing of surgical masks at appropriate times; (2) Respiratory system: Studies have pointed out that influenza vaccines could have a protective effect (Osterholm et al., 2012). In Taiwan, only 72.9% of practicing medical personnel undergo influenza vaccination (Centers for Disease Control, 2016). Therefore, it is necessary to increase the influenza vaccination rates of Taiwanese health care professionals. Currently, Taiwan\u2019s policies include vaccination rates as one of the medical accreditation indicators to encourage hospitals to advocate vaccinations for all their health care professionals. In addition, poor hospital indoor air quality (IAQ) may lead to hospital-acquired infections and various occupational hazards (Verde et al., 2015). Thus, we recommend that hospitals periodically monitor their air quality; (3) Delivery and puerperal complications: Currently, all Taiwanese hospitals have implemented the Labor Standards Act regarding the pregnancy period whereby pregnant staff are not to work from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. of the next day. We further recommend that hospital policy should establish a labor replacement system for pregnant staff in order to provide assistance to staff in their departments and prevent pregnant staff from working in a high-risk working environment. Constructing a supportive working environment for friendly nursing practice is also significant. Channels and mechanisms should be established to care for pregnant staff in order to provide life and work assistance, and support at different stages of pregnancy to alleviate their stress and promote their health.",
