The molecular weight of EGFP and SARS 6 protein are 27 and 7.5 kDa, respectively. In both Vero E6 and CHO cells, the anti-GFP antibody recognized the expressed SARS 6\u2013EGFP fusion protein showing the anticipated \u223c34.5 kDa band (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). The PUP3 antibody also recognized a single band with the expected molecular size (Fig. 3B). No signals were detected in Vero cells transfected with SARS 3b\u2013EGFP fusion constructs or pEGFP-N1 control vectors (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3), indicating the specificity of the antibody against the SARS 6 protein. Using the same antibody, expression of the untagged SARS 6 protein in Vero E6 cells was also confirmed (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, given the same amount of sample loading, the expression of the untagged SARS 6 protein was weaker relative to the expression of the SARS 6\u2013EGFP fusion protein. The CMV promoter drives protein expression in both pcDNA3.1 and pEGFP-N1 vectors, the possibility that the SARS 6\u2013EGFP fusion protein has higher stability as compared to the untagged SARS 6 protein cannot be excluded. The difference in expression may also be due to the differences in the temporal expression or transcription kinetics of the two plasmids.",

Although the specific subcellular localization of SARS 6 protein cannot be determined in these immunohistochemical results, notice the positive signals detected outside the nuclei of the SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2). The subcellular localization of the SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells was further determined by expressing the SARS 6\u2013EGFP fusion constructs in Vero E6 and CHO cells. Confocal microscopy showed that SARS 6\u2013EGFP protein was localized to the perinuclear region and colocalized with ER marker (Fig. 4\nA\u2013C) in Vero E6 cells. A similar localization pattern of the SARS 6\u2013EGFP was obtained in CHO cells (Fig. 4E and F). In contrast, the control EGFP protein was distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 4D, G and H) as expected [16]. EGFP fusion protein has been a commonly used marker to determine subcellular localization of proteins, i.e., the HIV accessory protein Vpr, to circumvent the need for immunofluorescence staining [16]. This approach is particularly suitable for the studies to which the antibody supply is limited (i.e., the current study). In many cases, the construction of a C-terminal fusion protein retains the normal biological activity of the heterologous partner [16], [17], [18]. Pewe et al., reported similar perinuclear subcellular localization of SARS 6 protein with HA tag on the background of the neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in rodent cells [19]. The identification of the SARS 6 protein subcellular localization laid the ground for further understanding of its role in SARS-CoV biology. Nevertheless, whether endoplasmic reticulum localized SARS 6 protein elicits any biological activities by interacting with other viral or cellular proteins requires further investigation.",

However, Vpr induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when expressed in cultured mammalian cells [20], [21]. In addition, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) accessory protein p12I is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and it can increase intracellular calcium and cell proliferation [22]. It is speculated that a protein localized to ER may modify intracellular signaling pathways by regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER and thus affect cellular DNA synthesis. Similarly, SARS-CoV may also evolve various mechanisms to optimize cellular conditions to its own benefit. At the current stage, the significance of SARS 6-induced DNA synthesis in SARS-CoV biology remains elusive, since such observation is obtained independent of the context of the whole viral genome.
