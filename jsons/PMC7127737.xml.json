Drugs that inhibit the M2 family dicarboxymetallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) or the A1 family aspartic protease renin (EC 3.4.23.15), as well as those that antagonize the 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled angiotensin receptor II (AT2), improve hypertension. Dual ACE and M13 metalloprotease neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin, NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibition has also been explored for the treatment of high blood pressure. Recently, a new member of the RAS, the M2 family monocarboxymetallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was identified.1, 2 It is a membrane-associated and secreted metalloprotease, expressed in heart, kidney, testes, intestine, and lung, with highest homology to ACE. ACE2 has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and lung disease.3, 4, 5\n",

The m-phenol 5b (X = OH) was converted into the triflate with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, and then coupled via the Suzuki protocol to phenyl boronic acid, providing the fully protected m-biphenyl derivative 6b. Subsequent hydrolysis of the amine masking group gave the m-biphenyl amine hydrochloride 2i.

The potential reduction in van der Waals interactions from the absence of a P1\u2032 side chain as well as the entropic gain from increased rotational freedom of the acid could account for this decrease in potency.

The alanine-derived analog 1c (ACE2 K\ni App\n = 14 nM, NEP K\ni App\n = 950 nM) decreases rotational freedom and recovers some of the ACE2 inhibitory activity lost upon removal of the P1\u2032 group, while not dramatically changing the activity versus ACE (K\ni App\n = 180 nM) or CpA (K\ni App\n = 11,000 nM).

Therefore, fluorinated derivatives of inhibitor 1o were prepared with the goal of maintaining potency and selectivity, while blocking potential metabolic sites of the naked phenyl ring. It was hoped that electron withdrawing groups would not only sterically impede metabolism, but also electronically deactivate the aryl ring to oxidation. The mono- and difluoro analogs 1p (K\ni App\n = 2.5 nM), 1q (K\ni App\n = 2.0 nM), and 1r (K\ni App\n = 0.85 nM) were potent ACE2 inhibitors with good selectivity.

It provides insight into the P1\u2032 SAR of the thiol series. The terminal carboxylate of the inhibitor accepts hydrogen bonds from the imidazoles of 345His and 505His and forms a salt bridge to the guanidine of 273Arg. Also, the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor donates a hydrogen atom to the carbonyl of 346Pro, while the amide carbonyl accepts a hydrogen atom from 515Tyr. Moreover, in addition to its normal ACE2 ligands, the imidazole nitrogens of 374His and 378His and the carboxylate of 402Glu, the active site zinc coordinates the thiol of the inhibitor. Furthermore, the P1\nsec-butyl group of the inhibitor forms van der Waals interactions with the S1 pocket composed of 347Thr, 504Phe, 510Tyr, and 514Arg. The greasy P1\u2032 3,4-difluorobenzyltyrosine side chain of 1r forms significant lipophilic interactions with the quite large S1\u2032 channel composed of the lengthwise canal between the two subdomains, including residues 274Phe, 445Thr, 406Glu, 409Ser, 370Leu, 371Thr, 276Thr and extending over to 441Lys and 442Gln. Although several residues in this pocket are hydrophilic, most of the polar groups are either involved in hydrogen bonds with other enzyme residues or oriented away from the S1\u2032 pocket, maintaining the lipophilic nature of this subsite. Based on this model, the 3,4-difluorobenzyl portion of the P1\u2032 substituent is hypothesized to occupy a different part of this large pocket than the P1\u2032 side chain of the carboxyl inhibitor MLN-4760 co-crystallized in 1R4L.",
