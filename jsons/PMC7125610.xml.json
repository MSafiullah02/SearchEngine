Common disease manifestations include pneumonia, septicemia and meningitis. In 2006 the World Health Organisation estimated that about 20% of all cause pneumonia and a substantial proportion of meningitis (varying geographically) could potentially be prevented by Hib vaccination and hence recommended the inclusion of Hib in all routine childhood immunisation programmes [2].",

As a result, Asian countries have been slow to include Hib vaccination into their routine schedules, and China and Thailand have still not introduced the vaccine [12]. An increasing body of evidence has been emerging that Hib substantially contributes to the burden of disease in Asia [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] and that the incidence and mortality associated with Hib in Southeast Asia are in fact similar to levels observed in many other parts of the world, in particular in the Americas [1].

Unlike bacteraemic infection, where isolation of a pathogen from blood provides well-established evidence of disease causality, the causal pathogen for non-bacteraemic pneumonia is typically unknown and no gold standard diagnostic techniques is available [20], [21], [22]. Widespread pre-hospitalisation use of antibiotics without prescription in Asian countries further limits proper aetiological identification. The lack of gold standard diagnostic techniques to identify the pathogen associated with an episode of non-bacteraemic pneumonia obscures assessment of the vaccine preventable burden of Hib pneumonia in common study designs [23]. Furthermore, vaccine-unrelated changes in the epidemiology of other pathogens contributing to total number of pneumonia cases can distort population impact estimates. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influeanzae are the leading causes of non-bacteraemic pneumonia supplemented by a sizeable contribution of respiratory viruses, including Rhinovirus, Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [24], [25]. While most of the serotypes causing pneumococcal disease show little variation over time in the absence of vaccination, serotypes 1 and 5 vary substantially in prevalence over time for yet unknown reasons [26] and are likely to cause a substantial amount of pneumonia despite low carriage rates [27]. Similarly the outbreak size of winter viruses can differ between seasons and can confound impact assessments [28].",

To address this we have calculated an adjusted RR that adjusts for viral circulation using viral ARI episodes as a proxy for circulation. The adjusted RR for non-viral associated RCP (NVP) was similarly estimated through a segmented Poisson regression model. With the same naming conventions as before the model additionally attributes excess cases of RCP (deemed virus associated pneumonia \u2013 VP), which includes both viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia infections, to changes in the monthly number of ARI due to influenza A, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza 3, rhinovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus (N\nt,1\u20137). Less than one case per month on average of influenza B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 4 and corona virus respectively was reported in the pre vaccination period; hence those were excluded from the analysis to limit the occurrence of statistical artefacts. Any potential negative association of viruses and pneumonia rates was omitted; i.e. presence of viruses was assumed not to prevent pneumonia (\u03d5\n1\u20137\n \u2265 0).log(Pt)=\u03b1+\u03c8It\u2208Tp+\u2211i(\u03d5iNt,i)+etIn other words, we estimate the excess number of RCP due to influenza A, RSV, hPMV, parainfluenza 3, rhinovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus to obtain adjusted number of RCP (RCP excluding excess VP) during the study period. Based on the adjusted number of RCP, the NVP, we then calculate the impact of Hib vaccination on NVP (1 \u2212 \ne\n\u03c8) as one minus the change in logged average monthly numbers of NVP before and after the introduction of routine Hib vaccination. Because of multiplicity the impact on NVP in this model also corresponds to the impact of Hib vaccination on RCP adjusted for the circulation of viruses.

To date most studies that were conducted in Asia reported effectiveness estimates from case-control designs rather than population based incidence impact. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 31% (\u22129% to 57%) in Brazil, 55% (7\u201378%) in children receiving three vaccine doses in Colombia, 21% (5\u201335%) in Gambia, 22% (\u22127% to 43%) in Chile, 45% (18\u201363%) in Ukraine and 62% (47\u201373%) in Pakistan [14], [29], [30], [31], [32]. All but Gambia and Chile were case control studies. The vaccine preventable proportion of RCP was 35% and 44% in a case control study in Bangladesh when using community and hospital controls respectively [33]. However, case control designs may overestimate vaccine effectiveness if vaccinated and unvaccinated communities differ significantly in their risk of pneumonia. The only study that did not detect any impact amongst children was a randomised controlled trial conducted in Indonesia, although a significant impact on meningitis and non-radiological pneumonia was shown in the same study [17]. Our findings suggest that routine childhood Hib vaccination is associated with a significant reduction in the burden of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in young children in Vietnam. This supports both the presence of a high burden of Hib pneumonia in Vietnam in the absence of vaccination and a high impact of routine vaccination with DTwP-Hib-Hep. The lack of a measurable impact of Hib vaccination in children between 2 and 4 years of age and too old to be vaccinated may suggest that herd protection has not been established yet and in subsequent years could further benefit the unvaccinated [40].",

            "text": "In several instances we chose assumptions in our estimates that may have led to an under estimation of the true impact of Hib vaccination on RCP (i.e. conservative assumptions). (A) In the absence of a catch up campaign a large proportion of individuals younger than 2 years of age have not been eligible for vaccination in the 21 months after vaccine introduction that we consider here. Hence our early estimate the impact of routine Hib vaccination is may be an underestimate of the full impact of Hib vaccination, although most Hib pneumonia is likely to occur in the first year. With an increasing duration of follow up a transition period can be included in the regression model to account for the initial period of low vaccination eligibility in the considered age groups and provide an estimate of the full impact of Hib vaccination. (B) We assume that a reduction of virus circulation among children presenting with acute respiratory symptoms is not associated with Hib vaccination. However, the observed decline could partly be due to a reduction in co-infections of viruses and Hib. In this case the crude estimate would be a more accurate estimate of the actual impact of Hib vaccination on RCP. (C) The decrease in severity of symptoms of children diagnosed with RCP at Khanh Hoa General Hospital in the post vaccination period could suggest an increase in health care seeking of children with milder symptoms. This could have led to an increase in the number of acute respiratory cases and RCPs reported over time, and in particular to an overrepresentation of ARI in the post vaccination era. On the other hand, it could reflect the rapid disappearance of severe childhood pneumonia associated with improved care seeking and overall socioeconomic development. When tested in a linear regression model we found no evidence for a significant decrease in RCP incidence during the pre vaccination era. (D) We do not account for possible changes in pneumococcal pneumonia, in particular due to volatile serotypes 1 and 5. In a subset of the pre vaccination period no serotype 1 or 5 carriage in children presenting with ARI was detected suggesting a low contribution of those types to pneumonia during this period [35] so any bias would likely underestimate the impact of Hib vaccination. There is no evidence available that allowed assessment of the circulation of pneumococcal serotypes and hence potential biases during the study period. However, a previous study did not find evidence of serotype 1 and 5 causing invasive pneumococcal diseases in Vietnam during the decade ending in 2002 [42] so their impact may be generally low in this setting and hence unlikely to greatly impact on our estimates. However in settings where those serotypes are more dominant, e.g. in Africa, this adjustment can be essential.",

Also the likelihood for the development of RCP on admission has potentially been reduced in the post vaccination era as the time from illness onset to hospitalisation decreased. Both, changes in antibiotic usage and timeliness of health care seeking could have led to an overestimation of the impact of Hib vaccination in our analysis. However, antibiotic usage and timeliness of health care seeking was similar between RCP cases and ARI cases without RCP suggesting that those factors had only modest impact on the development of RCP for a case admitted with acute respiratory symptoms in the study population. Furthermore, after the introduction of Hib vaccination we find little or no change in RCP incidence in 2\u20134 year old children, who were not eligible for vaccination in the study period tentatively suggesting that the observed impact among less than 2 year old children is vaccine specific and that potential changes in treatment and healthcare seeking behaviour in the population had little impact on RCP incidence.",

Nevertheless, influenza, RSV and rhinovirus are generally found to increase the risk of pneumonia [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. However, we could not find seasonally increased circulation of influenza A or B to be associated with a concurrent increase in radiologically confirmed pneumonia (Fig. 2C). Furthermore the limited number of cases only allowed for monthly resolution of the data. Hence, possible lags between viral infection and associated secondary bacterial pneumonia were not accounted for. Moreover Influenza A subtypes were not differentiated in the analysis. If these subtypes were associated with significantly different risk for pneumonia this could have masked the true contribution of the subtypes on VP. Also the adequacy of chest radiographs as gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis may be questioned [48], however, we use of multiple independent readers to minimise non-specificity.",
