In particular, we assess the terrorist use of biological agents represents a growing threat as the barriers to obtaining many suitable started cultures are eroding and open source technical literature and basic laboratory equipment can facilitate production\" [2] . In his opening statement before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Senator Joseph Lieberman, summarized his concerns surrounding global proliferation of legitimate biotechnology research and expertise. As Senator Liberman noted, \". . .while so much of a benefit in so many ways, also creates this problem because that work can be used to create weapons of mass bioterror\" [3] .",

This added dimension to proliferation makes it even more difficult to mitigate. The potential for non-state actors, which includes both domestic and international terrorists, successfully obtaining access to WMD's is a very real threat to the safety and security of all people [4] . One should realize that a nexus exists between WMD and terrorism. The driving motivation for terrorism is to inflict fear and create destruction to achieve their goals. The prospect of a terrorist faction successfully obtaining WMD poses one of the gravest risks to civilization. A successful WMD terror attack could potentially kill thousands and result in many more thousand casualties. Likewise, the social, political, and economical impacts of such an attack would threaten the civilized world. The interconnected nature of people, economies, and international infrastructure around the world can infuse seemingly isolated or remote events with global consequences [5].",

On 31 May 2003, President Bush unveiled the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in Krakow, Poland, which outlined a new interdiction cooperative agreement outside of treaties and multilateral export control regimes [6] . PSI is not a program housed in only one agency, but instead is a set of activities with participation by multiple U.S. agencies and other countries [7] . In its December 2002 National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Proliferation, the Bush Administration articulated the importance of countering proliferation once it has occurred and managing the consequences of WMD use. In particular, interdiction of WMD-related goods gained more prominence. U.S. policy sought to \"enhance the capabilities of our military, intelligence, technical, and law enforcement communities to prevent the movement of WMD materials, technology, and expertise to hostile states and terrorist organizations [8] . President Bush's efforts follow a long line of previous efforts to curb the proliferation of WMD (Illustration 1).",

While this was a valiant attempt, the agreement fell short as there was no built-in verification mechanism [10] . In 1993, the landmark Chemical Weapons Convention was held in Paris that resulted in 130 countries agreeing on the elimination of chemical weapons [9] . It also established the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), whose mission is to assure the objectives outlined in the CWC are carried out and for ensuring the implementation the CWC provisions. This includes the verification of compliance of CWC directives (43, 44) . The year 2007 marked the tenth anniversary of the CWC, which boasted 182-member states. In the preceding years between 1993 and 2007, approximately 25,000 metric tons of chemical weapons were destroyed, with over 3000 international inspections conducted. Even with the successes of the OPCW, the world witnessed Syria launch a chemical WMD attack on civilians, which we will discuss later in the chapter. According to the Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, the Mideast nations of Iraq and Syria have already demonstrated their use of WMD on civilians.

Iran's implementation of the JCPOA has extended the amount of time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon from a few months to about 1 year, provided Iran continues to adhere to the deal's major provisions. The JCPOA has also enhanced the transparency of Iran's nuclear activities, mainly by fostering improved access to Iranian nuclear facilities for the IAEA and its investigative authorities under the Additional Protocol to its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. Iran's ballistic missile programs give it the potential to hold targets at risk across the region, and Tehran already has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East. Tehran's desire to deter the United States might drive it to field an ICBM. Progress on Iran's space program, such as the launch of the Simorgh SLV in July 2017, could shorten a pathway to an ICBM because space launch vehicles use similar technologies.",

These are weapons that contain viruses and/or bacterial pathogens or poisonous substances that have been engineered to cause severe illness or death in human beings, animals and vegetation. In their natural state, these pathogens or substances are not normally fatal to living beings and must be amplified or weaponized to become a threat. In addition, biological weapons also require a delivery mechanism. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) categorizes biological threats into three distinct categories based on lethality, with each category containing specific biological agents. Category A contains the most lethal agents that pose the greatest threat, as they are easily disseminated and have the highest mortality rates [14] . Category A agents include Anthrax-Bacillus anthracis, Botulism-Clostridium botulinum, Plague-Yersinia pestis, Smallpox-Variola virus, Tularemia-Francisella tularensis, and Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses (which includes the Ebola Virus) [15] . Category B agents have a low to moderate morbidity and are less threatening to the general public. Category B agents include Bacterial, Rickettsial, and Protozoal agents (Brucellosis, Glanders, Melioidosis, Q Fever, Psittacosis, Typhus Fever, Cholera, and Cryptosporidiosi); Toxins (Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B, C. Perfringens Epsilon Toxin, and Ricin Toxin); and, Viral agents (Viral Encephalitides, including Venezuelan, Western, and Eastern Equine Encephalitis) [14, 15] . The final category is Category C, which are those pathogens that can be engineered for mass dissemination because they are readily available, have a general ease of production, and their potential for high mortality rates [14] . These include emerging viral pathogens, including Nipah Virus, Hantavirus, which also includes Hantavirus Pulmonary syndrome and Hantavirus Hemorrhagic Fever Syndrome. These pathogens have a higher mortality than Cat B Agents [15] .",

British General Sir Jeffrey Amherst proposed presenting local Indian tribes with the smallpox-laden blankets, which would allow colonist an easier path to colonization [16] . At a peace conference, the blankets were presented as gifts to the unsuspecting Indians. What the tribes did not realize, was that the blankets came from a smallpox-infected soldiers that were located in the area. The resulting impact was an outbreak of smallpox in the Indian tribes of the area which was estimated to have a case fatality rate of almost 90% [16] .",

Unit731 operated in over six different cities with more than 3000 researchers who all focused on the development of deadly biological agents [18] . Among the biological toxins researched included anthrax, plague, and typhus. Their test subjects included prisoners and innocent populations. It is estimated that over 10,000 people endured this horrible experimentation and later died as a result [16] . One of Unit 731's most notorious attacks occurred in 1941 with the air distribution of plague infected wheat and mosquitos over the town of Chang the, China. Within a week, residents of the town began dying of plague. The final death toll estimate was 400 people [19] . In the 1950s, the United States Navy sprayed a low pathogenic bacterium over San Francisco Bay by boat to assess the vulnerability of a large American coastal town to a biological attack [17] . In the 1970s, the USSR maintained a clandestine biological weapons research lab that was known as Chief Directorate for Biological Preparation (Biopreparat) that produced plague, tularemia, anthrax, glanders, smallpox and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis [20] .",

New or engineered pathogens can spread quickly throughout the world. In his book, \"Hot Zone\", author Richard Preston writes a fictional account of the spread of the Ebola Virus. Readers learned just how dangerous this pathogen was. Although this was a fictional account, an actual Ebola outbreak nearly occurred in Ranson, Virginia in 1989 at a CDC Primate Lab when monkeys became infected with a hemorrhagic fever outbreak. Although the incident was contained, it required the ethnicization of 450 primates by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Fortunately for the primate lab scientists, their strain of Ebola was not harmful to humans. This outbreak gave birth to the new Ebola-Reston strain, which is only one of five Ebola strains not harmful to humans [21] . The world's attention was again focused on the Ebola virus when in 2014, a Dallas hospital nurse became infected with Ebola after treating an Ebola patient. As the world learned of the Ebola incident, citizens and concerned scientists concerns over laboratory safety began to be heard. The pandemic potential of accidental release of insufficient biosafety presents a danger [22] . Ebola is just one example of a biological threat-there are many others. It is important to note that each pathogen is unique and requires differing forms of response and treatment. As noted in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Biological Incident Annex, individual pathogens present a real threat to public health and local plans should be written to deal with the aftermath of such threats [23] . Given the difficulty of weaponizing and distributing biological agents in enough quantity to create a mass casualty incident, it is unlikely that terror groups have this capability. In the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report, the Commission concluded that the United States should be less concerned that terrorists will become biologists and far more concerned that biologists will become terrorists [3] .",

Again in 1917, the Germans introduced a new chemical agent-Mustard Gas-which was referred to as the \"King of the Battle Gasses.\" Unlike chlorine or phosgene, mustard gas is a vesicant, also referred to as a \"Blister Agent\", whose symptoms may not be realized until 2-24 h after initial exposure [29] . Mustard gas produces large blisters on the skin and if inhaled, can cause blistering in the lungs.

Regulation attempts of chemical weapons dates back to 1675 when \"the first international agreement limiting the use of chemical weapons was signed between France and Germany, prohibiting the use of poison bullets.\" [9] In 1874 the Brussels Convention on the Law and Customs of War was signed, which prohibited the employment of poison or poisoned weapons, and the use of arms, projectiles or material to cause unnecessary suffering [9] . In 1889, an agreement was signed that was a part of The Hague Peace Conference in which countries agreed to abstain from the use of projectiles, the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases [9] . As we have read, the first half of the twentieth century witnessed nations putting great resources into the development of chemical weapons. From the Cold War years , the United States and the Soviet Union were the two major superpowers still producing and maintaining chemical weapons stockpiles. In 1997, the world's first multilateral disarmament agreement witnessed 130 signatory nations agree to specifically at eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles, which was known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) [9] . Their success was such that the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013.",

It is important to note that a radiological device is not a nuclear weapon. The threat radiological devices pose is through low-order detonation of explosives that spread the radiological agent in the atmosphere, ground and water. Topical exposure or inhalation of radiologically-contaminated substances is where the threat lays. As we have scene with biological and chemical substances, terrorists are always seeking the materials to construct Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs). Radiological events include the potential for terrorists to obtain these materials in an attempt to create the nonnuclear release of radioactive materials [33] . As we will read about under the Nuclear section of this chapter, the fall of the former Soviet Union and lapse of security in former nuclear sites potentially allowed for the sale of these materials on the black market. There are sites all around the world that radiological materials exist and many of these locations have virtually no security. RDDs are likely to be the radiological weapon of choice because of their relative simplicity and widespread availability of RDD-adaptable radioactive materials in medicine, scientific research, and industries, such as civil engineering, petroleum engineering, aeronautics, and radio-thermal energy generation [34] . As stated previously, an RDD is not a nuclear weapon and its main purpose is spreading radioactive materials in a low-order explosive. Although far less catastrophic than a nuclear detonation, an RDD attack would likely result in few immediate casualties, but would certainly have longer term impacts on public health. The ancillary impacts of an RDD include the potential of widespread panic, economic loss, and costly cleanup [33] .",

Towards the end of the Cold War, other nations began acquiring nuclear weapons. These nations included China, Pakistan, North Korea, and India. The addition of these nations added to the complex calculus of mutual assured destruction. Twenty years ago, Russia and 14 other newly-independent states emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union, which put into question the status of their 35,000 nuclear weapons spread out at thousands of sites across a vast Eurasian landmass that stretched across 11 time zones (Graham 2012).",

Chemical agents include Lung Damaging Agents (Chlorine (CL) and Phosgene (CG)), Blood Agents (Cyanogens), Blister Agents (Mustard (H), Lewisite (L), and Phosgene Oxime (CX)), and Nerve Agents (Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), and VX). Biological agents are those that contain viruses and/or bacterial pathogens or poisonous substances that have been engineered to cause severe illness or death in human beings, animals and vegetation. In their natural state, these pathogens or substances are not normally fatal to living beings and must be amplified or weaponized to become a threat. In addition, biological weapons also require a delivery mechanism. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) categorizes biological threats into three distinct categories based on lethality, with each category containing specific biological agents. Category A contains the most lethal agents that pose the greatest threat, as they are easily disseminated and have the highest mortality rates [14] . Category A agents include Anthrax-Bacillus anthracis, Botulism-Clostridium botulinum, Plague-Yersinia pestis, Smallpox-Variola virus, Tularemia-Francisella tularensis, and Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses (which includes the Ebola Virus) [15] . Category B agents have a low to moderate morbidity and are less threatening to the general public. Category B agents include Bacterial, Rickettsial, and Protozoal agents (Brucellosis, Glanders, Melioidosis, Q Fever, Psittacosis, Typhus Fever, Cholera, and Cryptosporidiosi); Toxins (Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B, C. Perfringens Epsilon Toxin, and Ricin Toxin); and, Viral agents (Viral Encephalitides, including Venezuelan, Western, and Eastern Equine Encephalitis) [14, 15] . The final category is Category C, which are those pathogens that can be engineered for mass dissemination because they are readily available, have a general ease of production, and their potential for high mortality rates [14] . These include emerging viral pathogens, including Nipah Virus, Hantavirus, which also includes Hantavirus Pulmonary syndrome and Hantavirus Hemorrhagic Fever Syndrome. These pathogens have a higher mortality than Cat B Agents.",

Radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) may be explosive-driven-a dirty bomb-or use nonexplosive means like a crop duster airplane. Radioactive material may be dispersed indoors to contaminate a building, though the scenario most commonly discussed involves detonation of a dirty bomb outdoors. The nuclear threat is the greatest of all threats The concern the world faces is what happens when a terrorist group obtains a nuclear weapon. One thing is for certain, we are in an age where terrorism is almost common place, with terrorists always seeking different ways to achieve mass casualties. The United States and United Nations have worked hard to eliminate the threat of the spread of WMD, but even with the best intentions, it is difficult to maintain enforcement with rogue states and terrorists. It is critically important that all public health providers maintain vigilance and become aware of the WMD threat.",
