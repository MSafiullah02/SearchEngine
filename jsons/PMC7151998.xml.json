Some compounds, such as aminoglycosides and penicillins, are isolated from living organisms, whereas others, such as oxazolidinones, quinolones, and sulfonamides, are produced by chemical synthesis. Accordingly, antibiotics can be classified based on their origin as natural origin, semisynthetic origin, or synthetic origin. Most of the common antibiotics used today are semisynthetic modifications of a variety of natural compounds. These antibiotics are used in both human medicine and animal agriculture to reduce incidences of diseases. They are usually administered by injection or orally via feed and water.",

Owing to the high energy requirements of cattle, growth promoters may play an important role by stimulating muscle formation and improving milk productivity (Peter and John, 2004). However, the use of growth promoters can have several side effects in cattle. The most common harmful effect is lactic acidosis, which both impairs milk production and debilitates cattle. To counteract this side effect and maintain a balance between benefit and harm, administration of lasalocid and monensin are probably the safest and most effective antibiotic growth promoters due to their activity in inhibiting most of the lactate-producing bacterial species without harming the major lactate fermenters. Australian cattle farmers also employ flavophopholipol, lasalocid, and monensin (JETACAR, 1999). Other cattle growth promoters used in Australia include narasin, oleandomycin, and salinomycin. The use of glycopeptide avoparcin was no longer permitted after 2000. In the European Union, the same types of ionophores \u2013 monensin and salinomycin \u2013 are used in cattle. However, the use of pristinamicin and quinupristin has been banned since 2000 (Dibner and Richards, 2005).",

In-feed enzymes are usually produced by fermentation of fungi and bacteria, after which these are used to stimulate growth as additives in animal feeds. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of in-feed enzymes as a substitute for antibiotic growth promoters for improving nutrient absorption and digestibility, gaining body weight, and animal performance. Based on recent studies, it was demonstrated that in-feed enzymes often have activities in promoting digestion of feed components that are normally poorly digested or totally undigested in agricultural animals (Hedemann et al., 2009). The mechanism by which in-feed enzymes promote digestion of feed components is believed to involve the breakdown of those hard-to-digest chemical components in the grains and meals such as nonstarch polysaccharides, especially arabinoxylans and beta-glucans, phytates, and proteins (Gerard et al., 2011). Added routinely to the feed of livestock and poultry, these enzymes are efficient at maximizing feed conversion efficiency, and more importantly they have no or very few side effects. As a consequence, numerous researchers are now focusing on improving the quality of existing enzymes, intending to broaden the range of feed ingredients in which they could be used as alternative growth promoters.",

Competitive exclusion products are usually processed from and composed of various species of undefined or partially defined bacteria isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of agricultural animals. Products such as BroilactTM, AvigardTM, and PreemptTM are often administered to newborn animals, especially poultry, and have shown their effectiveness in animal growth promotion, gut health maintenance, and even the control of pathogenic infection (Alaeldein, 2013). Several studies have found that a significant improvement of animal feed conversion ratio using Avigard treatment results from the reduction in feed intake and also the prevention of pathogenic colonization such as Salmonella and Campylobacter from the gut (Gerard et al., 2011). At the same time, multiple competitive exclusion products can also help reduce diarrhea and mortality levels, but the mechanisms remain unclear.",

Available probiotics can be divided into two main categories. One category is colonizing species such as Lactobacillus, Lactococci, and Enterococcus; the other is free-flowing noncolonizing species, which include both Bacillus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These beneficial microbes are able to ameliorate the overall health of animal by improving the gut microbial balance; however, their exact mechanism is still under investigation. One major hypothesis for their actions could involve their influence on intestinal metabolic activities, including the improvement of bacteriocins, propionic acid, and vitamin B12 production, and increasing the villous length and nutrient absorption (Christina et al., 2009). Other possible mechanisms include competitive exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms and their immunostimulatory activities.",

However, several questions about the active strains, the maximum dosage, the effective delivery system, and the potential risks remain unanswered and need to be further investigated. One more potential danger of using live probiotics refers to their antibiotic resistance. A report from the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (2001) concerning the safety of probiotic products found that Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus acidilactici were tetracycline-resistant. As a consequence, the use of probiotics could possibly put the whole food chain and the environment at risk. Moreover, the permanent establishment of probiotics in animal gastrointestinal tracts is difficult. Several studies have indicated that gut microflora are active and efficient in preventing new organisms from colonizing and becoming established (Jonsson and Conway, 1992). Finally, the high cost and high dosage of administration required for probiotics for growth promotion might also be a serious drawback to their widespread application in animal agriculture.",

Unlike probiotics, which are foreign microorganisms introduced into the gut competing with colonic communities which have already become established, the chief advantage of employing prebiotics in improving gut function is that their target bacteria are already commensal with the large intestine (Macfarlane et al., 2008). However, prebiotics cannot be effective if the targeted beneficial bacteria are not in the gut due to, for example, antibiotic therapy or intestinal diseases.

Transmission of enteric salmonellosis to humans usually occurs through consumption of contaminated poultry and poultry products, specifically eggs. Owing to the presence of multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella, antibiotic treatment against this pathogen has been compromised at least to some extent. One major concern is the strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (DT104) commonly found in poultry and eggs. DT104 is demonstrated to be resistant to at least five antibiotics \u2013 ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. Preharvest control of DT104 continues to be a significant challenge due to its increased virulence by alterations of inherent pathogenic characteristics and treatment failures resulting from the inappropriate use of antibiotics (Besser et al., 2000). However, combined use of trimethoprim and sulfonamide at the preharvest level might be effective in reducing Salmonella in chicken gut. Other possible choices include fluoroquinolones and the third-generation cephalosporins (D'Aoust et al., 2008); Table 2\nshows the preslaughter FDA-approved antibiotics commonly used in the poultry industry (Teshome et al., 2007).",

EHEC is mainly harbored in the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy cattle and is shed in their feces. The major source of EHEC was traced to ruminant manure, but undeniably, EHEC was also identified in some nonruminant farm animals including swine and fowl due to the cross-contamination spread by ruminant manure. But, since bovine manure is the major source of EHEC contamination in the farm environment and animal meat products, effective preharvest control targeting reduced prevalence and quantity of fecal EHEC excretion by live cattle is crucial. EHEC does not typically exhibit the drug resistance to the use of multiple antibiotics which is frequently found in enteropathogenic E. coli and other foodborne pathogens like Campylobacter and Salmonella, though the use of ionophores does not show significant influence on the prevalence of EHEC (Edrington et al., 2003, LeJeune and Kauffman, 2006). However, it has been shown that almost all EHEC isolates are susceptible to neomycin sulfate (Mora et al., 2005). Neomycin sulfate is an approved antibiotic used in cattle, where it has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the fecal excretion of EHEC (Elder et al., 2002, Woerner et al., 2006). Given appropriate use and quick withdrawal, neomycin appears to be a promising candidate for preharvest use in the cattle industry.

In addition to effectively stimulating swine growth rates and improving reproductive performance, preharvest use of antibiotics is also able to reduce the populations of foodborne pathogens including Campylobacter, EHEC, Listeria, and Salmonella. Currently, preslaughter use of carbadox, cephalosporins, lincosamides, macrolides, penicillins, pleuromutilins, polypeptides, quinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in swine feed (Morrison, 2001). Among these approved antibiotics, the feeding of chlortetracycline and tylosin decreased fecal shedding in swine artificially infected with EHEC, and the feeding of spectinomycin in pigs under 4 weeks old and weighing less than 15 lb effectively controlled the infectious bacterial enteritis caused by E. coli and salmonella (Friendship, 2006). However, bacitracin did not exert significant antimicrobial effects on EHEC (Irwin et al., 2003). Table 4\nshows the commonly used FDA-approved preslaughter antibiotics in the swine industry (Teshome et al., 2007).",

Such antimicrobial proteins are able to inhibit the growth of several major foodborne pathogens including EHEC, Salmonella, and Listeria (Stahl et al., 2004, Patton et al., 2007). The application of bacteriocin isolated from Lactobacillus salivarius and Paenibacillus polymyxa in chicken intestinal tracts has been shown to induce a dramatic reduction in broiler chicken cecal Campylobacter colonization (Svetoch and Stern, 2010). Nisin has already been found to be effective in spoilage bacteria reduction in meat and milk, and encapsulated nisin is able to inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes (da Silva Malheiros et al., 2010), although nisin's preharvest application is still under research. However, under the basic principle of bacteriocin, by protecting bacteriocins from ruminal or gastric degradation, once reaching the lower gut, bacteriocins exert their antimicrobial activities by disrupting the cell membranes of target foodborne pathogens. Owing to their nontoxic characteristics on eukaryotic host cells, bacteriocins are considered safe for consumption of meat and meat products.",

            "text": "Because they are highly specific in recognizing and injecting \u2018disrupting DNA\u2019 into a host bacterium, bacteriophages can be active against specific bacterial strains. Specificity allows bacteriophages to be used against targeted foodborne pathogens in a mixed population without disturbing the composition of normal gut microflora. In 2007, a phage spray produced by Omnilytics (Salt Lake City, UT), specifically against EHEC in preharvest live cattle, was approved by the FDA. Other studies have also tested the short-term reduction of Salmonella colonization in poultry and swine (Callaway et al., 2008). Several researchers have also tested the oral consumption of large doses of bacteriophages and found it to be harmless to animals. Owing to their rapid replication and high level of specificity, bacteriophages can serve as a potential preharvest strategy against foodborne pathogens in agricultural animals. However, the efficacy of bacteriophages against infecting bacteria should be tested in the lab before application. The specificity of bacteriophages is also a disadvantage when a need to target multiple pathogens or causative agents of disease is not confirmed (Inal, 2003). In addition, compared to antibiotics, bacteriophages are more complex organisms that are able to transfer genes between bacteria and induce pathogenic mutation. Only by careful selection of strictly lytic bacteriophages and sequencing their hereditary materials can cross-gene transfer be prevented (Inal, 2003). In comparison with antibiotics, the administration of bacteriophages requires trained personnel, which makes the application of bacteriophages much more difficult for farmers.",

In addition, preliminary studies examining the use of chlorate in broilers and in turkeys have also yielded promising results (Byrd et al., 2003, Moore et al., 2006).

More recently, a vaccine designed to inhibit fecal EHEC in cattle has also been developed (Fox et al., 2009). Based on these research efforts, the use of vaccination in preslaughter reduction of foodborne pathogens seems to hold promise. Vaccines made from any one bacteria serovar cannot confer cross-protection against another serovar, no matter how much antigenic similarity there is between them, but more than 2500 serovars of Salmonella are found in animals and humans. Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter hyointestinalis, Campylobacter upsaliensis, Campylobacter lari, and Campylobacter fetus are also found in farm animals (Singh, 2009).

These antibiotics are likely to result in residue in edible tissues such as milk and eggs. Multiple antibiotic residues are harmful during the development of human organs, as well as the nervous and reproductive systems. As a result, infants and young children are most susceptible to these residue compounds because of their weak body protection. By establishing preslaughter withdrawal periods, restricting certain antibiotics used in laying hens, and discarding milk produced after intramammary infusions of antibiotics in lactating animals, these harmful antibiotic residues could be reduced or even eliminated (Page and Gautier, 2012).",

However, the overuse of antibiotics has caused increased antibiotic resistance among multiple human pathogens. Whether or not the pool of resistance genes generated by use of antibiotics in farm animals has induced the prevalence of failures in therapy for human infectious diseases is compounded by the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry is still controversial. So far, judging from numerous journal articles, reviews, conference reports, newspapers, and TV reports, the inappropriate use of antibiotic in farm animals and its potential risk to human health have become the greatest public health concern among both consumers and scientists. Governments worldwide have already sought regulatory and legal authority in order to restrict or even abolish the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics (Page and Gautier, 2012).",

            "text": "Antimicrobial substances, especially antibacterial agents, are commonly employed worldwide to improve the performance, health, and production of livestock, dairy cattle, and poultry. These agents are used to protect against illness, help reduce significant agricultural losses, and prevent foodborne infections in humans. For the subtherapeutic use of antimicrobials, preharvest treatment for both promotion of animal growth and inhibition of colonization and cross-contamination of foodborne pathogens have drawn great attention because of the urgency of the situation as well as the effectiveness of antibiotics in human disease treatment. However, some agents used in animal agriculture belong to classes also employed in human medicine, such as macrolides, penicillins, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines. This dual use of antibiotics and the common concern of multiple antibiotic resistance in human pathogens and the potential impact of antibiotic residues in food on public health are controversial and have raised concerns. As a result, efforts to develop alternatives such as plant-derived antimicrobial agents and biopreservatives are underway. Although the thoughtful and measured therapeutic use of antibiotics or other effective antimicrobials is essential to livestock producers, regulatory bodies, and consumers, narrow-spectrum antibiotics remain the first choice, and a comprehensive understanding of the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics in preharvest-level farm animal production, along with proper guidance from the veterinary profession, are vital to solving this complex issue.",
