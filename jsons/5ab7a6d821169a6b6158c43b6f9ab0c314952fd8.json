Currently routine surgical procedures are at a halt globally, but whether one can delay cancer procedures remains an ethical issue, and still there is no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in these critical times. Methods Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. Results Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a ''do no harm'' approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making. Safety of healthcare personnel needs to be ensured at the same time.",

Since its inception in December 2019, the number of cases is rising exponentially worldwide. Since this is a novel virus, the human population does not have any prior immunity to fight against the disease nor there is any vaccine or therapy available [2] . The median duration of viral shedding is reported to be 20.0 days (IQR 17.0-24.0) [3, 4] . Hence, it is anticipated that the infection will remain at least for another 2-3 months before clearing. The impact of COVID-19 is substantial and has caused enormous economic, social and healthcare disruption worldwide. COVID-19 infection has been observed to cause mild illness and recovery in the majority (80%) of cases, more severe illness is seen in 14% cases, and only about 6% cases develop critical illness [5] . The risk of death is higher in those with higher SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score (5.65, 2.61-12.23; p \\ 0.0001), d-dimer [ 1 lg/L (18.42, 2.64-128.55; p = 0.003). The impact of the illness is highest in the elderly (odds ratio 1.10; 95% CI 1.03-1.17; p = 0.0043), and those with known comorbid illnesses including cancer [4] .",

The only paper published is a nation-wide analysis from China, in which only 18 (1%) out of 1590 COVID positive cases had a history of cancer [7] . Of these, six were women, but there was no case of gynaecological cancer-three had carcinoma breast, one had thyroid cancer and two had lung cancer. Overall, 5 (18%) of the cancer cases had carcinoma lung. The treatment history of two cases was not known, 25% (4/16) had received either surgery or chemotherapy in the past 1 month, and the remaining 12 cases were cancer survivors on routine follow-up. It was observed that patients with cancer were older (mean age 63.1 years vs. 48.7 years), had more tachypnoea (47% vs. 23%) and had more severe baseline findings on chest computed tomography (94% vs. 71%). There was no difference in gender, other baseline symptoms, comorbidities or baseline severity of chest radiographs. Risk of severe events defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, need for mechanical ventilation or death was higher in cancer patients than in the general population (39% vs. 8%; p = 0.0003). History of cancer was found to be the most significant risk factor for severe events after adjusting for other risk factors including age, comorbidities and history of smoking (odds ratio 5.34, 95% CI 1.80-16.18; p = 0.0026). Similarly, the risk of rapid deterioration was also greater in those with history of cancer (HR 3.56; 95% CI 1.65-7.69). Patients who underwent surgery or chemotherapy in the past 1 month had a higher risk of severe events (75% vs. 43%). Patients with history of lung cancer did not have an increased probability of deterioration [7] . The study emphasized that cancer patients are particularly at risk for adverse outcome and rapid deterioration because of their systemic immunosuppressive state due to malignancy, previous recent or ongoing therapy.",

For low-risk endometrial cancer, the risk of death increased if surgery was conducted after the 8th week of diagnosis. Subsequently, the 5-year survival was 16% inferior for cases who underwent surgery after 4 months of diagnosis than for patients who underwent surgery within 3 weeks. Conversely, for high-risk disease, a delay of up to 21 weeks did not have a significant impact on survival in this study [10] .

However, the timing of initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy also has a direct impact on survival. According to a meta-analysis by Liu et al. [12] , the overall survival was worse in women in whom administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was delayed more than 6 weeks (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32). Hence, on the one hand if delay in therapy is detrimental, the risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death is 3.5 times more if they acquire COVID-19 infection. These factors have to be taken into consideration in the decision on whether to treat immediately or delay the definitive surgery; if surgery is done, it needs to be ascertained whether it will be feasible to administer adjuvant therapy within 3-6 weeks of surgery as per the standard practice. Counselling patients, allaying their anxiety and calming the fear of delay in therapy versus the risk of therapy in the current compromised healthcare scenario is another challenge that needs to be addressed on an individual basis. Moreover, the reality of exhausted supplies and limited resources is another unprecedented situation [3, 4] . Availability of ICU beds and ventilators is a real challenge presently. It is speculated that channelling diagnostic, therapeutic (surgical, medical or radiation oncology) and ICU resources for care of cancer cases will be in direct conflict with COVID-19 services as this pandemic progress, but this has ethical concerns as well. Safety of healthcare workers and limited availability of COVID-19 testing along with judicious use of PPE need further attention. The major concern for cancer patients now is getting admitted in hospital and receiving definitive therapy after admission which may be delayed or denied owing to resource diversion [13] .",

Approximately 70% of gynaecological cancer cases present in advanced stages (Table 1) , around 20% default during the preliminary work-up and another 30% default after starting adjuvant therapy. These factors result in poor survival and high mortality rates [15] . The disease stage remains the most important prognostic variable affecting survival [16] . The 5-year DFS was 56% in women with cervical cancer when they were diagnosed in stage IIb, but it reduced to 40% when the disease was more advanced [17] . Similarly, the 5-year OS in ovarian cancer is reduced to 30% and 15% when the disease is diagnosed in stage III and stage IV, respectively, as compared to stage II when survival is as good as 65% [18] . The patients with endometrial cancer who present with advanced stage were at higher risk of relapse (HR 5.78; 95% CI 1.18-28.57) and death (HR 6.89; 95% CI 1.76-27.02) [19] .

They and their families must understand the impact of delay on cancer outcome and healthcare limitations to provide optimum care. Thus each case should be individualized and treatment planned accordingly. For newly diagnosed advanced cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) may be considered. Those who are already receiving NACT may continue, and if logistics do not permit performance of surgery after 3-4 cycles, all six cycles may be completed [22, 24] . However, in situations with increasing number of cases cytotoxic chemotherapy may also be postponed. Initiation of radiation therapy within 6 weeks of surgery is also an important prognostic factor, but considering the lack of recommendations during this crisis, one may individualize its use and reschedule accordingly. Hypofractionation is an option that will reduce the number of hospital visits. Brachytherapy may be carried out as per schedule for non-COVID cases [22, 24] .",

In women with low-risk uterine cancer, who have been waiting or expected to delay beyond 6-8 weeks, a nonsurgical option may be considered after careful selection of cases. Conversely, high-risk cases may be taken for surgery on priority even in extended lockdown situation. In cases with advanced or recurrent disease, a confirmatory biopsy may be taken, and systemic therapy or hormonal therapy may be considered. 4.
