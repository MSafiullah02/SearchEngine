The CVB3 genome is composed single-stranded rna encoding polyproteins, which are cleaved to individual functional proteins by 2a and 3C proteases proteins which have been targeted for drug development. Here, we showed that protease activity required to activate a toxic protein may be used to prevent viral infection. Methods: We modified the MazE-MazF antitoxin-toxin system of Escherichia coli to fuse a C-terminal fragment of MazE to the N-terminal end of toxin MazF with a linker having a specific protease cleavage site for CVB3. This fusion protein formed a stable dimer and was capable of inactivating the mrna interferase activity of MazF which cleaves the ACA sequence in mRNA substrates. Results: The incubation of 2a proteases with the fusion proteins induced cleavage between the MazE and MazF fragments from the fusion proteins; the subsequent release of MazF significantly inhibited virus replication. additionally, we note that, CVB3 infected HeLa cells quickly died through a MazF toxin mediated effect before virus protein expression. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the MazEF fusion protein has a strong potential to be developed as an anti-virus therapy following CVB3 infection.",

Most bacteria have the toxin-antitoxin (Ta) system which is a mechanism to control the cell growth. Toxin induces cell growth arrest and even cause cell death without the co-expression their cognate antitoxins 13, 14 . Thus, virus proteases have been considered ideal drug targets. in the present report, we attempted to positively use the activity of the viral proteases to activate a latent toxin (MazF) of Escherichia coli from a toxin-antitoxin (MazF-MazE) fusion protein by cleaving off antitoxin MazE fragment. MazF thus released functions as an ACA-specific mrna interferase 15 to eliminate almost all cellular mrna as well as single-stranded viral rna in the vi-rus-infected cells.",

However, viral capsid protein VP1 was significantly decreased in MazEF toxin treated HeLa cells, because cell death is induced by the MazEF toxin before virus replication. These results demonstrated that CVB3 infected Hela cells were killed by direct overexpression of MazEF toxin before initiation of virus replication.",

We confirmed the CVB3 capsid protein positive and negative strand rna replication using rT-PCr. in CVB3 infected Hela cells, CVB3 genome expression was significantly decreased in cells expressing the MazEF fusion protein compared with control cells (Figure 4 ). CVB3 pro-tease2A modified the structure of the MazE and MazF proteins. MazEF fusion resulted in the rapid death of CVB3 infected cells which subsequently affects virus genome amplification. Xiong et al. have previously demonstrated in vitro that the enteroviral protease 2a directly cleaves murine dystrophin in the hinge 3 region 20 in order to determine whether this cleavage plays an important role in the development of enterovirus-mediated myocarditis, sarcolemma membrane disruption, viral propagation and direct virus-mediated cytopathic effect in vivo 21 . in this study, we applied this concept to inhibit virus propagation and systemic side effects accompanying in CVB3 infection. The first stage of viral replication involves processing of the protease 2a into a polyprotein; this is a critical time point to inhibit virus amplification and propagation to the other cells.",

Activation of MazF in mammalian cells has been result in BaK-dependent apoptotic cell death 16 . We could regulate CVB3 infected cell death through MazEF fusion protein induction by CVB3 expressed protease 2a. in addition, the fusion protein may potentially be used as a tool for the prevention and/or treatment of rna virus infections, as cells carrying the fusion protein with a linker cleavable with a specific rna viral protease may attain resistance to a rna viral infection 18 .
