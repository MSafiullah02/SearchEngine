IVT was successfully adapted to artificial and environmental mixed bacterial community samples by attaching random hexamers to the T7 RNA promoter sequence in lieu of oligo(dT) (Gao et al. 2007 ). However, microarray analysis of WTA product from these mixed bacterial communities showed representative detection was dependent upon the amount of starting RNA. In another study, Rift Valley fever virus from brain biopsies was successfully amplified by WTA in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus DNA (Berthet et al. 2008) , but starting amounts of RNA were high, ranging from 10 4 to 10 6 copies. More recently, TransPlex TM WTA has been used on cultures of coronavirus to generate sufficient nucleic acid for sequencing new human viruses when propagation in cell culture is inefficient (Banach et al. 2009) .",

RNA viruses may occur in very small concentrations in drinking water and other environmental media, making them difficult to detect with molecular methods. Additionally, there are numerous types of RNA viruses (e.g. enteroviruses, noroviruses, astroviruses) that may be present in environmental media, further complicating detection because they do not share a common gene, analogous to the conserved 16S gene in bacteria, which may be targeted for detection by a singleplex or easily multiplexed PCR. To determine whether WTA can improve molecular detection by amplifying viral RNA from environmental media, this study assessed the ability of WTA to maintain log-linear amplification over a range of initial RNA concentrations, to efficiently amplify RNA from environmental matrices and to overcome inhibition by substances in these matrices.",

In this study, increases in EV target copy number of c. 2-4 logs after application of WTA resulted in significant improvements in detection by qRT-PCR, as evidenced by the statistically significant increase in the total number of positively detected low copy number (at or near the LOD) samples. However, it is difficult to accurately quantify improvements in sensitivity from application of WTA (other than positive \u2044 negative detection), because consistently obtaining an aliquot positive for virus when the sample concentration is below a certain limit is improbable (Chen et al. 2007) . In this study, when target concentrations are at or below the estimated LOD, the probability of successful WTA is decreased because of decreased probability of target being added to the WTA reaction. Additionally, as formation of WTA template is a random process, metatranscriptomes produced from replicate amplifications can differ, particularly for low copy number samples. Although WTA of low copy number samples may result in infrequent amplification because of these factors, when a target is successfully amplified, improvements in concentration are significant, as demonstrated by pre-WTA:WTA ratios that are higher for averages than medians (Table 1) .",

Improvements in detection from WTA have been described on a concentration basis, but it is also useful to describe gains in terms of volume. TransPlex TM WTA increases an initial sample of 10-375 ll of WTA product. Access to a larger amount of product makes it easier to run multiple reactions for multiple pathogens or conduct assays where a larger volume of high-quality sample is needed such as microarray analysis. There is more room for assay error or to run the assay multiple times if the quantity after amplification is near the LOD. Volume may no longer be a limiting factor for some types of molecular assays, which is beneficial even if no significant gains are seen in terms of target concentration. The ability to quantify the original target number of samples amplified by WTA is another important feature of this study. Because the dilution series stayed consistent post-WTA application, resulting in log-linear amplification, environmental samples amplified by WTA may not be limited to a presence \u2044 absence interpretation of data. Samples can instead be quantified based on known standard curves. This demonstrates that increases in sensitivity and total sample volume gained using WTA are not at the expense of sample quantitation.",

WTA was able to amplify target RNA despite competition from background nucleic acids. Moderate concentrations of nucleic acids had a minor effect on amplification efficiency, while higher concentrations had a greater impact. As background nucleic acids increase, there is likely a decreased chance of amplification of the target as nontarget nucleic acids out-compete low concentration targets during the random amplification. Although EV WTA:pre-WTA ratios were lower for WTA of EV added to mixed nucleic acids (c. 1-3 log increase in target) compared with WTA of EV only (c. 2-4 log increase in target), the ratios still show significant amplification of EV targets were gained despite the presence of competing nucleic acids.",

Although inhibition was difficult to quantify, WTA successfully amplified targets of low concentration despite the presence of large of amounts of competing nucleic acids from a natural water sample that probably contained substances that typically interfere with PCR.

Although SYBR Green qRT-PCR detection of pre-WTA samples with the Schwab et al. (1995) EV primer set was effective, it was not effective for analysis of WTA product. Detection of multiple product peaks in melting curve analyses of SYBR Green-based qRT-PCR indicates that multiple products were formed during WTA, a by-product of template shearing during the nonspecific, nonprimer-directed amplification. The multiple nontarget products ultimately interfered with detection of the target EV amplicon. Also, TransPlex TM WTA creates both singlestranded and double-stranded cDNA product. Because SYBR Green is an intercalating dye, which indiscriminately binds between all dsDNA molecules, the high background fluorescence can probably be attributed to the large quantities of nontarget dsDNA produced during WTA. TaqMan probes increase the specificity of qRT-PCR by binding only with the target amplicon. However, product information from Sigma-Aldrich now states that cDNA from WTA should be purified prior to use because some components may interfere with downstream applications. This information was not provided in the pre-release version of the kit used in these experiments, but could perhaps improve the use of SYBR Green in this situation.",
