            "text": "Like many others caught up in the emerging-disease narrative, which is based on the tenets of germ theory, the story of infection barriers is one of setting the human and the nonhuman virus against each other, as the victim versus the menace. Viruses are commonly understood to be \u201c\u2018bad matter\u2019 to be prepared for, brought under control, and ultimately eradicated or rendered impotent\u201d (White 2015, 145\u201346). Unlike the germ theory of disease, which makes a specific microbe responsible for a specific disease (e.g., the coronavirus is responsible for SARS), an ecological perspective holds that microbes are not essentially pathogenic (Methot and Alizon 2014). Rather, as Hinchliffe et al. (2016) have argued, disease emerges from the complex entanglement between the immune system of a host and the microbial milieu in and outside of the host. Various scholars have noted how, much like Hong Kong in the face of SARS, global public health programs adopt an antimicrobial stance to the control and/or elimination of infectious diseases, however, which might prove to be counterproductive in securing human life (Macphail 2014; Methot and Alizon 2014; Fishel 2015, 2017; White 2015; Hinchliffe et al. 2016; du Plessis 2017; Lorimer 2017, 545).",

Scientists are understanding better the causes of infectious diseases, but they also \u201cincreasingly hear about beneficial microbes and the consequences of their decline or absence\u201d (Lorimer 2017, 544).8 Causal links remain unclear and contested, however; as Lorimer finds, there is \u201ca widespread reappraisal underway in modern medicine of the salutary potential of the microbiome and the therapeutic use of microbes\u201d (Lorimer 2017, 544). Humans and microbes seem deeply and irrevocably entangled. This has led anthropologist Stefan Helmreich to consider the figure of homo microbis, made up of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa (Helmreich 2014, 2015). What are the implications of this understanding of the human body as mostly microbial to the way we fight infectious diseases in global cities and elsewhere?",

Essentially, viruses are \u201cpackets of pure information\u201d in that they are protein encasements of genetic material in the form of either DNA or RNA. RNA viruses such as Influenza A (responsible, for example, for avian flu in 2003, the 1918 flu, and swine flu in 2010) evolve by engaging in \u201cantigenetic drift\u201d when mutating while replicating.

It is after these specific antigens that Influenza A viruses are named by their H and N numbers (MacPhail 2014, 10). The pathogenicity of Influenza A viruses is established both by their molecular makeup and their ability to cause serious illness in their host species, birds or other. A highly pathogenic virus causes severe or lethal illness in bird or other species populations.

These prokaryotic viruses \u201caffect human health by impacting bacterial community structure and function\u201d (Relman 2015; also Wylie et al. 2012). Because viruses evolve very quickly, the human virome (and thus also the microbiome) is changing all the time. Each human virome is different and unique as it evolves and is formed both by preexisting immunity and viral and human genetics as well as by human lifestyle, age, geographic location, and susceptibility to disease, all of which affect individual exposure to viruses (Delwart 2013). From this perspective, diseases are not the outcome of a virus or other microbe infecting a human, as germ theory holds, but emerge from the unique constellation of political and ecological relations that affect the biological interactions of the human, the animal, and the microbe and lead to the potential development of a diseased state\u2014that is, pathogenesis.

While a number of theorists have begun to conceptualize a new materialist politics and ethics within modern political theory (Bennett 2010; Connolly 2013; Mitchell 2014), others have looked to indigenous cosmologies, which take into account the world we share with other kinds of beings, to formulate a postanthropocentric politics (Kohn 2013; Tsing 2015; du Plessis 2017).

Two notions are central to this ancient Chinese strategy: (a) the notion of a situation or configuration (xing)\u2014that is, as a relation of forces such as are immanent to an ecology\u2014and (b) the notion of the potential (shi) of a situation/configuration.

Bennett (2005, 461) usefully elaborates on this by explaining that \u201cShi is the style, energy, propensity, trajectory, or \u00e9lan inherent to a specific arrangement of things.\u201d For Bennett, \u201cshi names the dynamic force emanating from a spatiotemporal configuration rather than from any particular element within it.\u201d As \u201cboth the membership (of a configuration or assemblage) changes over time and the members themselves undergo internal alteration,\u201d as Bennett points out, the shi or mood of a configuration also changes (Bennett 2005, 461). In Margaret Archer's words, everyone in the configuration \u201cpossesses autonomous emergent properties which are thus capable of independent variation and therefore of being out of phase with one another in time\u201d (Archer 1995, 66). It is possible that an individual element such as a virus, in an antigenic shift, \u201cbecomes out of sync with its (previous) self\u201d and forms new relations within an assemblage, \u201cleaning towards a different set of allies\u201d (Bennett 2005, 462). As such, the members of an assemblage \u201cmaintain an energy potentially at odds with the shi\u201d (Bennett 2005, 462). It is for this vibrancy, according to Bennett, that the agency of assemblages cannot be understood in terms of passive social structures.",

Li bases his analysis on the traditional conception of the Chinese city and the practice of defense in walling the city off against danger. By arguing that, in the struggle against infectious diseases, contemporary practices of urban defense have taken on another guise, namely infection barriers, Li is able to demonstrate how the politics of public hygiene operates not only through overt public programs but through infection barriers that are affectively knit into the fabric of the urban architecture and tissue of city dwellers. Although his lens on Chinese urban defenses takes seriously ancient Chinese thought in the making of urban spaces, nonetheless, the politics of infectious disease remains caught up in the prevalent and dominant oppositional narrative of the human against the microbe. Infection barriers set up the human and the nonhuman virus against each other, as the victim versus the menace. Like antivirals and antibiotics, urban hygiene practices are never entirely able to control pathogenic circulation. This is because urban hygiene proceeds on the basis of a very narrow conception of disease, namely the widely accepted germ theory of disease.",

While a small number of viruses are pathogenic, the majority are benign, and some are even essential to human life. Strategies to eliminate them may kill pathogenic viruses but essential viruses might also be killed off in the process.

However, there is also a need to consider and adapt the human practices that both create(d) the easy passages for viral circulation as well as forced viral mutations through the overuse of antiviral (and antibiotic) agents or vaccine development which is thought to have led to antiviral resistance. Most of all, rather than fostering an oppositional relation between the human and the virus, there is a need for an appreciation of the vital role of the virus in human lives as well as of how deeply we are entangled with the virus.",

Much like the Chinese general evaluating the course of things immanent to a situation, since humans thrive on a range of other beings doing well, \u201can interest in human security becomes an interest in biodiversity: thriving is not a zero-sum game between different species, in fact, quite the opposite\u201d (du Plessis 2017, 18). Global health projects ignore this and are struggling to deliver what they aim to do.",
