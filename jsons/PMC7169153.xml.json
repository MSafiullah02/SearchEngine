Compared with the traditional assays, the reported pseudovirus\u2010based assays have demonstrated a good correlation with the WT virus\u2010based assay; the pseudovirus\u2010based assays are usually high\u2010throughput procedures with fewer amounts of serum samples needed.1, 104, 115, 116 Wilkinson et al compared 22 platform technologies for assaying antibody against EBOV with neutralization assays by using the WT virus and found that the 5 best assays included methods based on WT and VSV pseudotype neutralization and ELISA, but the lentiviral and other platforms were problematic.117 Notably, Duehr J et al indicated that some anti\u2010EBOV glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies could neutralize and protect against pseudotyped VSV\u2010EBOV but were nonneutralizing against WT EBOV.118\n",

The success in employing pseudovirus in ADCC assays may be because the surface proteins of pseudovirus largely retain their native conformation and, following infection, a portion of these proteins remains on the surface of the target cells. In the pseudovirus\u2010based ADCC assay, target cells are first infected with the pseudovirus, followed by the addition of monoclonal antibody and modified Jurkat cells (effector cells). If the monoclonal antibody has ADCC activity, the Fab portion will bind to the target cell, while its Fc will bind and activate the modified Jurkat cells, which have been engineered to stably express the Fc receptor, V158 (high affinity) variant in addition to luciferase under the control of an NFAT response element.52\n",

It was found that some of these compounds have a broad range of antiviral activities against MARV, influenza H5N1, and LASV.8 By using pseudovirus, Elshabrawy et al were able to select a small molecule compound that had a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against SARS\u2010CoV, MARV, Hendra virus, and NiV. Further investigation by these authors revealed that 1 compound prevents viral entry into the cells by blocking cathepsin L\u2010mediated enzyme digestion.121 Besides small molecules, pseudoviruses have also been used to screen herbal medicines for their potential antiviral activities.122, 123\n",

            "text": "While some of the technical challenges associated with pseudoviral systems have been described above, there are several remaining issues that are also worth mentioning. By definition, pseudoviruses only contain the membrane/envelope proteins of the WT virus. While the membrane/envelope protein can largely mediate viral entry in a fashion like that of the WT virus, these viruses can only replicate for 1 round or may not always induce pathogenesis as their WT counterparts do. Therefore, results from assays using pseudotyped viruses should be compared and validated against the WT virus\u2010based assay, which remains the golden standard.69, 76 Additionally, the virus shape may influence its suitability for constructing a corresponding pseudotyping virus. For example, MLV, HIV, and SIV are spherical viruses, whereas VSV is bullet\u2010shaped. Therefore, the pattern of glycoprotein distribution/conformation/density on a pseudotyped virus may not reflect the \u201cnatural\u201d state of envelope proteins on the WT viruses (eg, as in filoviruses, which are thread\u2010like). It is also a good practice to compare various packaging systems. Indeed, investigators sometimes used 2 packaging systems simultaneously to prepare pseudoviruses or compared their resulting pseudovirus with one packaged by the VSV glycoprotein.15, 19, 93, 124, 125 Notably, Bilska et al showed that some Env\u2010pseudotyped virus preparations give rise to low levels of replication\u2010competent virus, which highlights the need to perform rigorous testing for replication\u2010competent virus before initiating work on any pseudovirus preparations at a lower BSL.126 While the successful generation of pseudoviral particles is mainly limited to enveloped viruses, efforts should be made to determine whether nonenveloped viruses could also be effectively pseudotyped.",
