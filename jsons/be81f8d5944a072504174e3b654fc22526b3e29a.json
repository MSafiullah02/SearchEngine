How do people preserve a sense of purpose when our ability to meaningfully engage with activities in previously reliable settings is profoundly disrupted? The current moment provides a formidable test of this question, as widespread transmission of Covid-19 is drastically transforming our environment, restricting access to familiar spaces, and prompting extreme physical distancing practices. This global pandemic requires thinking critically about how environmental changes influence the experience of purpose, so to ensure individuals remain engaged in daily life and feeling capable of contributing in valuable ways and are better able to endure current hardships and those on the horizon.",

To reconcile personorganization fit in these new environments, organizations may need to identify ways to remind employees of how their contributions align with an overarching mission, as more traditional signals of collective performance may be less evident. While virtual meetings and online workspaces are not novel, future research might identify a range of individual differences that may inform who is most likely to remain engaged with work activities when they are mandated to occur remotely (Kissmer, Knoll, Stieglitz, & Gross, 2018) . Moreover, for those who lose jobs or live in regions with disproportionately high levels of unemployment, the challenge of preserving a formerly held sense of purpose may be even more formidable. Past research has suggested that individuals higher on conscientiousness -a disposition toward being hardworking, organized and achievement striving -is predictive of greater losses in well-being following job loss (Boyce, Wood, & Brown, 2010); given the conceptual connection to purposefulness, studies are needed to understand whether sense of purpose may itself be a risk factor for people dealing with job loss. Income loss, concerns over labor-market security, and PURPOSE 6 limited opportunities to socialize about work experiences are likely to undermine well-being and sense of purpose (Clark, Knabe, & R\u00e4tzel, 2010; McKee-Ryan, Son, Wanberg, & Kinicki, 2005) .",

Remote learning environments pose obvious challenges to this type of responsiveness: without in-person contact, the sparks of early interest and curiosity that may otherwise proliferate to become purposes may be less visible (Kashdan & Yuen, 2007; Zhang & Bonk, 2006) . Of course, virtual technologies can offer several benefits, including providing students with cost-efficient and time-saving access to materials and alternative ways to visualize content and engage with content (Henderson, Selwyn, & Aston, 2017).

Yet, as physical and social constraints obscure familiar practices and roles, the current pandemic stands to also alter how teachers feel, identify themselves, and pursue their aims. There is evidence to suggest that teachers tasked with transitioning to remote instruction undergo a transformative process ranging from initial resistance to embracing new pedagogical modifications to help students (Redmond, 2011) . Yet, such transformation may be muddled for teachers abruptly forced to adopt remote instruction practices, without an opportunity chose how they can be meaningfully aligned with their unique style and educational aims. Thus, teachers' sense of role and contribution represent a critical target for inquiry in understanding how the landscape of education is currently being transformed. There are likely to be key individual differences in teachers' abilities and willingness shift to remote instruction that are in need of discovery and assistance through helpful intervention.",

Keeping sufficient distance from others minimizes the likelihood of infection, but in doing so creates an iatrogenic impediment to social connection. Perceiving support from others correlates strongly with feeling purposeful (Weston, Lewis, & Hill, in press) , and engaging with a purpose often necessitates making an impact beyond oneself (Damon, Menon, & Bronk, 2003) . This can be challenging when interpersonal interaction is limited. Being unable to visit in close proximity with friends, family, or neighbors is a painful sacrifice in the context of Covid-19, and risks lowering individuals' sense of purpose. Indeed, reliable social connections, evidence of belonging, and sense of familiar place have all been found to be robust predictors of purpose (Lambert, Stillman, Hicks, Kamble, Beumeister, & Fincham, 2013; Steptoe & Fancourt, 2020) .",

In one sense, the issue of physical proximity pervades those previously discussed insofar that it questions how we can maintain sense of purpose, in the absence of our typically close associates who recognize and appreciate our efforts. However, the absence of physical proximity to others presents additional unique challenges, insofar that social isolation and ostracism prove problematic for a sense of purpose (Stillman, Baumeister, Lambert, Crescioni, DeWall, & Fincham, 2009 ), likely because we feel less engaged with life. Indeed, though the media has focused on the economic toll of the physical distancing guidelines, the limitations on in-person contact hold broader consequence for purposefulness in the pandemic, which may prove difficult to mitigate solely through virtual connections.",
