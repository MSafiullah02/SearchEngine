That was followed by a significant decrease over the next 11 days (p<0.001) to reach 0.071 cases per million persons. A steady rise then followed, which saw a significant increase in incidence rate to 1.429 cases per million persons (p<0.001). Percentages of death and cured cases varied across the different countries; nevertheless, death percentages have generally been decreasing since the start of the crisis.",

The clinical findings among most patients were dry cough, dyspnea, and fever. This led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to designate the pathogen as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" or SARS-CoV-2 before the World Health Organization (WHO) termed the disease itself COVID-19 (coronavirus disease in 2019) in January 2020 [2] . This epidemic is the third coronavirus outbreak in the last 20 years after the SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV [3] .",

However, a significant decrease in incidence followed during the next 11 days, mainly due to decisions taken by the Chinese government and the Chinese CDC [13] . These decisions ranged from raising awareness, disinfection, and declaring states of emergency, to building make-shift hospitals for patient management [3, 14] . This helped contain the disease in China and led to an eventual decrease in incidence. Nevertheless, a subsequent significant increase in worldwide incidence ensued as of day 33 onward due to the rapid spread of the disease across the Chinese borders.

It is evident that the Italian healthcare system was taken by surprise with respect to the viral outbreak, and this lack of preparation explains the initial increase in death rates [15] . The subsequent decrease can be explained by the initial attempts at containment proposed by the Italian government; however, oversaturation of the hospitals and facilities caused a subsequent rise in the death rate that has been going on steadily [16] . On the other hand, Iran had a mortality rate of 100% during the first couple of days of reporting. This can be warranted as under-reporting from the Iranian government due to lack of screening resources possessed at the time as well as the vulnerable healthcare system present, which could not properly contain or adequately treat the disease in the affected populations [17] .

If the test turns out negative, it is advised to remain in home quarantine for 14 days. People who are exposed to the virus but do not show any symptoms must remain in home quarantine for 14 days. People who exhibit symptoms but have not been exposed to the disease must check with a medical doctor, implement safety precautions (proper coughing and sneezing etiquette), and avoid going out unless necessary. Finally, those who show no symptoms and have not been exposed to the disease are recommended to practice continuous hand hygiene and adhere to precautionary measures (washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use of antiseptics, avoid touching the face, etc.). Avoiding unnecessary social interactions is also essential for the prevention of exposure.",

Nevertheless, the healthcare plans adopted by China have proved that social distancing, increasing sanitation, and employing full quarantine can be very beneficial for containing this pandemic. As the worldwide incidence rate increases, governments are urged to take strict measures and enforce stringent precautions to help contain the disease, limit its spread, and decrease its subsequent mortality rate.",
