            "text": "Furthermore, experimental infection models using in vitro human placental explants, and bi- and tri-dimensional culture models, have also demonstrated ZIKV infection and replication in the placenta. Mainly, Hofbauer cells, mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts and cytotrophoblast cells (both villous and extravillous) are prone to be infected and act as virus reservoirs, as wells as decidual cells and decidual macrophages in the maternal compartment (Tabata et al., 2016; Aagard et al., 2017). As such, trophoblast cells that compose the placental barrier can be infected and, besides primary cultures, several trophoblast cell lines were also successfully proven to be infected by ZIKV, as Swan 71, JEG-3, BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo cells. As such, they provide good models to test ZIKV molecular interactions and potential interveners (Aldo et al., 2016; Arumugasaamy et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2017).",

They exert important biological activities as antioxidant and photoprotective compounds, due to their capacity to fight against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and through absorbing ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Saewan and Jimtaisong, 2013; Agati et al., 2013; Souza et al., 2015). Ultraviolet A (320-400 nm) and B (290-320 nm) radiations are associated with a number of irreversible damages to cutaneous tissue, such as photoaging and skin cancer, while UVB radiation is related with immune dysfunction, erythema and sunburn, triggering oxidative stress and DNA damage (Afaq, 2011; Gregoris et al., 2011). One of the preventive measures against these radiations is the use of sunscreens. There is a renewed interest in the incorporation of natural extracts with antioxidant properties, in a sunscreen. The reasons for that are the perspective of reducing oxidative damage induced by UV rays, increasing physical and chemical stabilities of the sunscreens, and complementing the photoprotective action (Scalia and Mezzena, 2010; Pr\u00e1 et al., 2017), as recently demonstrated (Afonso et al., 2014; Dzia\u0142o et al., 2016; De Oliveira-J\u00fanior et al., 2017). Protective formulations prepared with the crude extract of the leaves of S. terebinthifolius showed absorption on the UVB photoprotection area (Bulla et al., 2015).",

Control cells presented large cytoplasms with cellular extensions, with more intensity after 24 h culture, possibly due to increased F-actin polymerization, with the formation of stress fibers, also with a number of cells in different stages of mitosis (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, cells infected after 2 h with MR766 strain already presented NS1 protein positivity inside some cells, with no observed cytopathic efffects, although cells appear to have brighter phalloidin staining in comparison to control, with more stress fibers and F-actin aggregates in protusion tips, indicating focal adhesion points (Fig. 3B). After 24 h, around 60% of cells had massive positivity for ZIKV NS1 protein, more pronounced in the endoplasmic reticulum area, although visible in other compartments and the tips of filopodia. Also interesting to observe, the cellular confluence was reduced in comparison to control and infected cells had smaller area of cytoplasm with more condensed and smaller nuclei, the first cytopathic effects we observed with MR766 strain in these cells. Regarding the PE243 strain, after 2 h, we have also observed few cells positive for ZIKV NS1 protein, and some adhered to the cell membranes, with the presence of some atypic mitosis figures, which had viral particles in the cytoplasm. After 24 h, around 40% of cells were positive for ZIKV NS1 protein, and we no longer observed mitosis. However, we did observed several clusters of extracellular DNA mixed with NS1 proteins, and cytoplasm small pieces scattered, indicating total cell rupture. Apoptotic bodies were also observed and, when cells were infected, but still preserved their structures, NS1 protein was more located perinuclearly, close to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3B). Also important to highlight the increased amount of cells without cytoplasm or with scarce cytoplasm residues, greatly stained for NS1 ZIKV protein (Fig. 3B inset), indicating that in only 24 h, the PE243 strain at MOI 1 induced more pronounced cytopathic effects in comparison to the MR766 strain.",

Some natural products have already been described to inhibit ZIKV infection or its replication in different cell types. In addition to the promising extracts from S. terebinthifolius Raddi, we have used the antimalarial chloroquine diphosphate as a positive control of antiviral activity, as it has been described by different sources (Delvecchio et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Shiryaev et al., 2017; Kao et al., 2018). Other active plants have been already described, such as Doratoxylon apetalum, an indigenous medicinal plant from Mascarene Island, which inhibited Zika and Dengue virus infection in leukocytes (Haddad et al., 2019). One polyphenol present in large amounts in the green tea, (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has been also described as a potent antiviral molecule, able to inhibit ZIKV entry in Vero E6 cells (Carneiro et al., 2016). Delphinidin (D) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)] were shown to inhibit more effectively the virus production, on flaviviruses West Nile Virus infection (V\u00e1zquez-Calvo et al., 2017). Curcumin and suramin can also inhibit ZIKV infection on different cells (Wah et al., 2017; Mounce et al., 2017) and other compounds such as GSK126, nanchangmycin, obatoclax, pentagalloylglucose, saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and 25-hydroxycholesterol have been also described to inhibit ZIKV endocytosis or entry in different models (Silva et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that our study is pioneer in showing antiviral candidates against ZIKV infection with action in trophoblast cells, without cellular toxicity.",

(2014) with 83.33% for the methanolic extract of fruit of S. terebinthifolius. In relation to the concentration required to reduce the DPPH\u2022 by 50%, the STPE extract showed an IC50 value of 6.1 \u00b5g mL-1, while the STWFE extract did not reach 50% inhibition at the studied concentrations. The obtained value is in agreement with the literature. Bernardes et al. (2014), found IC50 value < 10 \u00b5g mL-1 for the methanolic extract of the fruit\u2019s peel of S. terebinthifolius. For the FRAP method, values of 488.6 and 3484.7 \u00b5mol TE g-1 were obtained for STWFE and STPE extracts, respectively (Table 2). The higher ferric reducing power exhibited by the peel extract can be attributed to its higher phenolic content. Along this line, Ali et al. (2014) evaluated the methanolic extracts of different parts of Punica granatum L. (peel, pulp, seeds and whole fruits). The peel extract exhibited the highest ferric reducing capacity. According to the authors, the higher antioxidant capacity exhibited by extract may be due to the presence of the phenolic compounds chlorogenic acid, rutin, coumaric acid and pyrogallol.",

Since the extracts presented such similar response to inhibiting ZIKV infection, we must now search for molecules present in both extracts to identify which one(s) would be responsible for such promising effect.
