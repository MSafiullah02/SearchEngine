Reds focus on individual human patients\u2019 health and insofar as there is a concern for the environment, it tends to be only for those environmental matters that negatively bear on their patients\u2019 health. More precisely, physicians in principle commit themselves to serving individual patients\u2019 \u201cbest interests\u201d. Like a photographer\u2019s shallow depth of field, this focus renders a particular patient in sharp detail, with everyone and everything else in a blurry background. They have no inclination or reason to directly value the environment, apart from its bearing on those \u201cbest interests\u201d. Indeed, as the principle source of pathogens and predators, Nature may seem to be a threat best kept at bay by wholesale antiseptic or other chemical measures.3 Since Reds tend to focus on the relationships between health care providers and their patients, this would seem to show them to be the ethical humanists Callicott had in mind.",

Their concern is not with the survival and welfare of current individual flora or fauna, but with species of flora or fauna and their role in promoting the stability and health of the ecosystem of which they are a part. Indeed, current Greens go well beyond Aldo Leopold\u2019s focus on the \u201cland community\u201d to include concern for the whole biosphere, even the whole planetary system on which biota depend. They have also become concerned about animals in feedlots and laboratories far removed from \u201cthe land\u201d and other forms of non-human life. To that extent, our Greens\u2019 holism includes sentient fauna and non-sentient flora, as well as abiotic components of ecosystems. Against such an encompassing moral landscape human patients and their particular relations to individual health care providers may seem an insignificant few amongst many, and medical researchers and their pharma sponsors appear primarily as despoilers and polluters.",

In various contexts, biomedical ethicists widen their focus to include the interests of other current or future patients or the public more generally. Most physicians need to ration their time and attention among hospital and office patients, some of whose \u201cbest interests\u201d need more time and attention. And when drugs, organs, or staff are in short supply, physicians need to survey and rank patients, first treating the worst off and delaying or denying treatment to others. In checking contagious diseases, they need to think about people not yet exposed, as well as the animals who are or could be vectors. Likewise, in enrolling patients in randomized clinical trials of drugs or procedures, physicians may be as much or more concerned with the large class of future patients who may benefit than with the particular patient being enrolled with less than an even chance of benefit. In actuality, Reds often have the illness and health of others in mind in ways that may compromise the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the patient in the bed or chair in front of them.

Environmentalists working to preserve old growth stands, for example, often focus their attention on a particular tree, one that may be the oldest or the most beautiful. Tree-sitters will anthropomorphize \u201ctheir\u201d tree and if they are to lose that individual, the loss is both symbolic and personal.

            "text": "These differences of scale and focus make for differences in the theories and policies to which Reds and Greens incline. Attending to individual patients, Reds are inclined to theories and practices that stress patient and professional autonomy, rights, and freedom from coercion except in emergencies and epidemics. They may invoke the power of government only in the framing and policing of public health policies, as well as for taxation needed to support medical research and to fund medical treatment. Greens, by contrast, are given to framing issues in terms of competing harms, benefits, and values and often look to government regulation as a political means for promoting their values. Greens are critical of the traditional focus on individual human rights, particularly property rights, as they are thought to license exploitative use of natural resources. Though some Greens want to assert the \u201crights of nature\u201d and some animal liberation theorists would like to extend the class of rights holders to include non-human animals, Greens, in general, tend to focus on harms and benefits and an appreciation of living beings and systems as \u201cteleological centers\u201d for whom things can go better or worse (see, for example, Taylor 1986 and Plumwood 1993). For Greens, arguing about harms, benefits, and promoting organisms\u2019 and systems\u2019 telic ends is more direct and compelling than trying to establish the \u201crights of nature\u201d. This also allows Greens to avoid the theoretical complexities of attaching rights not just to individuals but also to potentially diverse collectives. Harms and benefits are part of a more general framework of values, are more easily defined and debated, and have the potential to be more inclusive.",

Apart from electronics and weaponry, there are few, if any, areas of human endeavor whose progress has been as steady and impressive as that of medical and surgical knowledge and practice in the last century. Some skeptics declared the end of the \u201cGolden Age of Medicine\u201d when new, highly contagious diseases\u2014such as AIDS, SARS, and Ebola\u2014suddenly appeared in the late 20th century. But within a short time the pathogens were identified, various treatments discovered, and the spread of the diseases containable with suitable government support. Admittedly, the \u201cwar on cancer\u201d has not gone as well as predicted, but there have been some impressive victories and new grounds for predicting further progress against tumors that resist current treatments. New drugs are greeted and prescribed as \u201cpromising\u201d, even for off-label uses yet to be tested. When drugs fail to fulfill these promises, physicians are confident that better drugs are forthcoming, even if current patients may not live to benefit from them. Even when patients have not responded to a particular sequence of drugs, physicians foster and share the hope that a yet-untried remedy will work, even if it has helped few other patients in the past.",

There have been local improvements in water and land quality, remediation of brownfields and contaminated rivers, but initial successes on a larger scale have proved temporary (for example, ozone-hole contraction and improved Californian air quality). Moreover, there are frequent cases of counter-productive projects; for example, a reduction of chemical pollution that unexpectedly fosters predators that decimate the class of plants or animals one is trying to protect. Attempts at reintroducing critically endangered species such as whooping cranes or great apes back into their natural habitats have met with mixed success. Attempts to eliminate invasive species in order to promote or protect native plants and animals more often than not set off a cascade of unintended consequences. Recently, political inability to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, itself a disappointment, has led some to begin discussing geoengineering projects as a solution to global climate change. Suggested interventions include: deflecting a small percentage of incoming radiation from the Sun by placing huge mirrors at the Lagrange point between it and the Earth; fertilizing the oceans with plant life to soak up more carbon dioxide; and capturing vast quantities of emissions from power plants and burying them in sedimentary rock deep underground (for a groundbreaking analysis of the moral hazards raised by geoengineering see Gardiner 2010). Such suggestions, however, find little favor with Greens. Given the history of disappointments and failures, human intervention into natural systems is generally thought to be a very bad idea by most Greens. These failures also contribute to a hopelessness that humans will be able to do anything useful to protect the natural world.",

Consequently, NCI ordered many tons of the bark to provide enough Taxol for large randomized clinical trials and gave Bristol-Meyers a five-year monopoly on the testing, production, and distribution of the drug. Oncologists, of course, hailed this promising drug, for they had little to offer patients with Stage III ovarian cancer.

Factory farms, the large-scale, intensive confinement operations that government agencies and industry now refer to as CAFOs\u2014concentrated animal feeding operations\u2014control every aspect of the animals\u2019 lives from birth through slaughter.4 In the United States, roughly 2% of all farms produce 40% of the animals consumed, while their corporate owners are opening more factory farms in countries that have relatively lax regulations and enforcement. For example, Smithfield Foods, the world\u2019s largest producer of hogs, expanded their factory farming operations into Romania, one of the poorest countries in the European Union, as well as to Mexico, with notable costs to human and animals alike. By mass-producing pigs, Smithfield Foods is able to manipulate the market, and in Romania, after temporarily lowering prices, roughly 90% of the small family farms were forced out of business in just a four-year period (Carvajal and Castle 2009). Many of the farmers sold their land and left the country to look for work. And its not just livelihoods that factory farming destroys, but quality of life in the communities in which they are located. In Iowa alone, hogs excrete 50 million tons of manure annually, and overall farm animals produce three tons of manure for each American (Bittman 2008).

Many Greens are hunters and see the consumption of animal bodies as a way to bring us closer to \u201cnature\u201d. It is not possible for everyone to hunt their own food, so eating animals that are killed for consumption may be considered the next best thing. J.B. Callicott, in the aforementioned article, urged that we draw a \u201csharp distinction between the very different plights (and rights) of wild and domestic animals\u201d.

Globally, factory farms are one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, beef production generates 24 times more CO2 than the nutritionally equivalent serving of rice and vegetables (Bittman 2008).5 Factory farms also significantly degrade air and water quality. Waste from factory farms, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, have contaminated waterways and endangered local wildlife. The Sierra Club reports that in the US, \u201chog, chicken and cattle waste has polluted 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states\u201d (http://www.sierraclub.org/factoryfarms/). According to the US Department of Agriculture, \u201cAnimal waste in the United States has been estimated to contribute about 50% of all anthropogenic ammonia emissions, 25% of nitrous oxide emissions, and 18% of methane emissions\u201d (http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/AgAndEnvironment/animalagriculture.htm). A 2006 report produced by the United Nation\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, entitled \u201cLivestock\u2019s Long Shadow\u201d concluded that:[T]he livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole. Globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases and of on the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity, while in the developing and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution.

Those concerned about the treatment of animals, and a few insightful environmentalists have been trying to bring factory farming to public attention for decades. Indeed, two path-breaking women began that work almost 50 years ago. Factory farms first came under scrutiny in the early 1960s with the publication of Ruth Harrison\u2019s Animal Machines. Rachel Carson\u2014whose Silent Spring (1962) exposed the devastating environmental consequences of pesticides, and argued that \u201cbetter living through chemistry\u201d is, in fact, not better but calamitous\u2014wrote in the preface to Animal Machines:Modern animal husbandry has been swept by a passion for \u201cintensivism\u201d; on this tide everything that resembles the methods of an earlier day has been carried away. Gone are the pastoral scenes in which animals wandered through green fields or flocks of chickens scratched contentedly for their food. In their place are factorylike buildings in which animals live out their wretched existences without ever feeling the earth beneath their feet, without knowing sunlight, or experiencing the simple pleasures of grazing for natural food\u2014indeed, so confined or so intolerably crowded that movement of any kind is scarcely possible.

            "text": "But let us return to the plight of the pigs. Pigs are highly intelligent, social animals that suffer terribly on factory farms. They are also genetically similar enough to humans that they are susceptible to human flu viruses. They are also susceptible to avian viruses, and have been referred to as \u201cmixing vessels\u201d in which strains of human, avian, and swine influenza swap genetic material to become ever more potent. The potent viruses can jump from pigs to humans and back again. Virologists have suggested that pigs were the intermediate hosts responsible for the birth of the last two flu pandemics in 1957 and 1968 as well as the current influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) (See Wuetrich 2003; and Smith et al. 2009). Not surprisingly, large concentrations of pigs, as exist on factory farms, increase the risk of human exposure to these viruses because the humans who work on factory farms come in contact with a large number of animals on a regular basis. The first known cases of the 2009 pandemic were reported in the village of La Gloria, near Perote in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Perote is home of Smithfield Foods subsidiary Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a factory farm operation that brought almost one million hogs to market in 2008 and owns 56,000 sows. Although Smithfield claims it found \u201cno clinical signs or symptoms of the presence of swine influenza in the company\u2019s swine herd or its employees at its joint ventures in Mexico\u201d and scientists have now reported that the virus probably began infecting humans months before the infections gained attention, there have been heightened calls for increased oversight of intensive animal production. Factory farms are incubators of disease and the regular use of antibiotics to prevent disease is contributing to multidrug resistance, which is making it harder to contain illness. Increasingly, governments, as well as health and consumer protection organizations, are realizing that the way animals are raised on factory farms is directly linked to a negative impact on human health.",

Focusing on the human health consequences of certain environmentally destructive practices, such as factory farming, increases the range of motivation for Green living. When the consequences are immediate, unlike say global climate change or biodiversity loss, then calls for remedy are louder. The force of Reds\u2019 focus on immediacy can lead to change and if a concern for human health leads to more sustainable food production practices, which in turn has good consequences for non-human as well as human animals and their environments, it makes sense for Greens to welcome Reds as allies, as in the case of Taxol and the Yew.",

Perhaps a recognition of the dangers of \u201cintensivism\u201d that Rachel Carson recognized long ago might provide for common ground. The mass and fast production of animals for food, much like the mass production of automobiles or soon-to-be obsolete consumer products, is motivated on the part of producers largely by desires for profit, and on the part of consumers largely by desires for convenience and status. These impulses contribute to a failure to engage in meaningful ways with the environment from which these products come, and in the case of sentient beings, the suffering that the animals endure. These desires also contribute to a host of stress related health problems. Intensivism leads to alienation and perhaps Reds and Greens can find common ground in efforts to resist it. The \u201cslow food movement\u201d that works to ensure that good food is produced in a fair way that does not harm our health, the environment, or animal welfare is a vivid example of successful resistance to alienating intensivism.

Occasionally, as in Vietnam, the US targeted elephants on the Ho Chi Minh trail and sprayed 3 million acres of forest and crops with Agent Orange; those operations took a large, uncountable toll of human and non-human life as well. Sometimes war analysts do keep a separate census, somehow arriving at the figures, for example, that in World War I five times as many animals as men were killed, including 8 million horses. But there is little moral point in analyzing the carnage of war into human and non-human categories, except to remind us of the pain and suffering of those beings otherwise dismissed or overlooked as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d. There is surely no call to assign relative weights to human and non-human death and multiply the numbers. Reds and Greens can, without such moral mathematics, simply consider carnage without refinements. They may not agree to pacifism, but they could plausibly arrive at a mutual anti-militarism, as well as an anti-nationalism, which fuels and is generated by war. Just as more and more doctors have to subscribe to the principles of Doctors without Borders, just so most environmentalists are almost by definition Environmentalists without Borders, all of them rightly concerned about the increasing spread of disease and declining health among populations of both humans and non-humans alike.",

That is, Reds can come to a greater appreciation of non-human life and Greens of human life, as well as of the varying threats to both that corporate, militaristic, and nationalist assumptions and practices increasingly pose. An alliance so motivated would please Van Rensselaer Potter who, in the 1960s, called for a new field of Bioethics that would lead to better-informed political leaders and international treaties to restrain this industrial\u2013military domination (Potter 1971).
