Recent global outbreaks, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) , avian influenza (H5N1), pandemic (swine)influenza (H1N1) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) have rightfully received global attention, both in relation to the disease burden, the risk of rapid spread and the additional economic cost relative to travel and trade restrictions. To complete the picture of the disease burden and economic cost of human disease related to animals a number of endemic human infections that are continuously transferred from animals (e.g. salmonellosis, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, rabies, cysticercosis) should also be considered. It is estimated that more than six out of every ten emerging infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals [1]. A number of factors, including poverty, increasing population density, disruption of wildlife habitats, increased food trade and changes in food preservation and consumption habits have resulted in increased risks of contraction of infectious diseases and subsequently their potential global spread. Globally, about 23 % of all deaths are caused by infectious diseases, with the most significant burden in developing countries [2]. Nearly all of the most important human pathogens are either zoonotic or originated as zoonoses [3\u20136]. Striking examples include HIV/AIDS and Spanish influenza, which started by interspecies transmission of the causative agents [7\u201310] and have caused millions of deaths worldwide and more recently SARS and MERS coronaviruses and H1N1 and H5N1 influenza A viruses.",

However, surveillance is still typically targeted at a relatively limited number of specified diseases, and, maybe more importantly, there is a very significant global disparity in national disease detection systems and methodology. In particular, public health efforts and patient treatment are hampered by different obstacles: the use of different, specialized, expensive and difficult-to-compare detection techniques; a lack of collaboration between different microbiological fields; (inter)national politics on the disclosure of (patient) information and research data; intellectual property rights; and, a lack of sufficient diagnostic capacities particularly in developing countries. A more effective and rational approach to the prevention of microbial threats is essential at the global level. Efforts to mitigate the effects of infectious threats, focusing on improved surveillance and diagnostic capabilities, are crucial [11]. With recent technological advances and declining costs in the next generation sequencing field, these tools will play an increasingly important role in the surveillance and identification of new and previously unrecognized pathogens in both animals and humans but also for identification and characterization of traditional pathogens. Inherently an enormous increase in microbial whole genome sequences (WGS) is to be expected, providing a wealth of information to aggregate, share, mine and use to address global public health and clinical challenges. The goals of the Global Microbial Identifier (GMI) initiative in this respect will be outlined below.",

Molecular diagnostic tools, which rely on the recognition of short pieces of unique genome sequence (e.g. PCR and microarray (biochip) technologies) and provide sensitive and specific detection and sufficient genetic diversity for subtyping, are used routinely in clinical diagnostic and surveillance settings. Although the partial genome information, such as epidemiological markers, often is sufficient for patient management and basic surveillance objectives, from a public health perspective the increasing capacity for more extensive sequencing most likely will increase the depth of information gathered on pathogens and disease. Recombination and reassortment of viral genomes for instance may generate future threats; influenza A viruses for example are able to undergo reassortment if a single cell is concurrently infected with more than one virus [12]. These reassortment events can dramatically change the evolution of influenza A viruses in a certain host and lead to new epidemics and pandemics. Such events may easily be missed when surveillance is relying on molecular diagnostic tools that target small microbial genome fragments.",

This can have important implications; for instance during the recent outbreak of MERS coronavirus in the Middle East, analysis of small genome fragments did not provide sufficient phylogenetic signal for reliable typing of virus variants [13]. Classically, whole microbial genome sequences were determined by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Nowadays next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are used increasingly in the human medical sciences, and are now also widely used to identify and genotype microorganisms in almost any microbial setting [14\u201317]. There are different NGS techniques targeting single microorganisms or a complete metagenome in a sample through methods unrelated to specific sequence recognition.",

Today, the actual cost of sequencing an average bacterial genome of 5 Mb would in practise cost between USD 50\u2013100. It is estimated that both the price and the speed of WGS analyses will decrease to a point where it can seriously compete with traditional routine diagnostic identification techniques. The enormous potential of WGS in the surveillance of infectious diseases [18,19] has been demonstrated in many studies now including the tracking and tracing of the cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010 [20], the Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC) outbreak starting in Germany in 2011 [21] and others e.g., [22,23]. During the EHEC outbreak, scientists from around the globe performed NGS and shared their results for analysis. The collaboration between these researchers allowed for joint and rapid analysis of the genomic sequences, revealing important details about the involved new strain of E. coli, including why it demonstrated such high virulence. Similar collaborations exist globally during emerging viral infections such as MERS coronavirus. Continuing innovations, however, are required to allow NGS techniques to become standard in clinical practice. In addition, hurdles regarding ethical, legal, social and societal issues need to be overcome.\n",

As a consequence of the steadily decreasing costs of WGS, an increasing number of microbiological laboratories have embarked on WGS projects to characterize own stocks of infectious agents in their existing biobanks. This in turn generates huge amounts of genomic data in private databases as well as significantly increased numbers of genomes to the global DNA databases such as GenBank. This genomic information is, however, not fully interconnected and in most cases not accompanied with sufficient (national or international) metadata. The need to integrate these databases and to harmonize data collection has been generally recognized by the scientific community for some time [24]. Further integration of these databases and linking the genomic data to metadata for optimal prevention of infectious diseases, and to make it fit for other uses including routine diagnostics, is the new challenge.",

At a systemic level, the use of NGS will enable uniform laboratory-, reporting- and surveillance-systems not only relative to human health, but reaching out to the identification of microorganisms in all other habitats, including animals and the environment: a true \u2018One Health\u2019 approach [25]. At the same time the development of new centralized and de-centralized diagnostic systems will be significantly simplified with the potential of real-time characterization of microorganisms in individual, local decentralized labs with sequencers and internet link-up. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to determine the species, type as well as the antimicrobial/antiviral susceptibility of both bacterial and viral pathogens, even when using sequencing directly on clinical samples [18, 26]. This would be even more valuable for clinical laboratories in developing countries that do not currently have the same diagnostic capacities as most developed countries.",

Such a system should be deployed in a manner which promotes equity in access and use of the current technology worldwide, enabling cost-effective improvements in plant, animal, environmental and human health. If the system is set up in an \u2018open access\u2019 format it would likely enable comprehensive utility of NGS in developing countries, since the development of open databases and relevant algorithm platforms at the global level would enable immediate translation of sequence data to microbial identity and antimicrobial resistance pattern. In general, it is necessary to have a comprehensive database of all known microbial DNA sequences to make full use of locally derived DNA sequence to identify and characterize your isolate microbiologically and epidemiologically. A global system, supported by an internationally agreed format and governance system, will benefit those tackling individual problems at the frontline (clinicians, veterinarian, epidemiologists, etc.) as well as other stakeholders (i.e. policy-makers, regulators, industry, etc.). By enabling access to this global resource, a professional response on health threats will be within reach of all countries with (even relatively simple) basic laboratory infrastructure.",

To achieve this, GMI envisions a WGS database and analytic tools that are used and maintained by multidisciplinary researchers, clinical microbiologists, food scientists, (bio)informaticians, veterinarians, physicians, and other stakeholders. This database should be useful for basic research and for identification and disease diagnosis of any possible microorganism. In September 2011 the first international GMI conference was organised in Brussels1 to discuss the possibility to use WGS as a microbiological diagnostic tool on a global scale [27]. At this stage several preconditions for a successful initiation of an initiative of this sort seemed to have been met: (1) WGS had become mature and a potential serious alternative for other genotyping techniques, (2) the price of WGS had been falling dramatically and was now in some cases below the price of traditional methods, (3) vast amounts of IT resources and a fast internet had become available in most parts of the world, and (4) suggestions had been made that a One Health\n(human/animal) approach could enable improved control of infectious diseases [28].",

Such additional, federated databases may also be commercial, and this may hold both risks as well as advantages. The key will most likely be that the software adding and retrieving data can reach all relevant information. This means that either the software needs to handle multiple formats used by different databases, or the data structures of different databases should be similar. In addition, commercial databases should address how they can be accessed by GMI software and how users pay for their database use. Clearly this involves many controversial issues. Commercial involvement may on the one hand put limitations on the development of the GMI database and the speed at which it will evolve. On the other hand, in economic terms it will have a great spin-off in terms of companies that may offer services to and depend upon the GMI database, in a way somewhat similar to the functionality of the internet at present.

Important advances in this area will be to generate more user friendly software to take the tools that now mainly are geared towards the bioinformatics and basic science communities, to the first-line users (clinicians and public health and food safety professionals) e.g. to help the clinical field with disease diagnosis or to help with complicated global tracking and tracing analyses relative to food contamination or infectious diseases. User friendliness would increase the use of the GMI database and thereby its value. It may be envisioned that this may come through the combination of apps and online software tools generated for use on (super) computers down to smart phones.

Also, different fields of research or policy making may have use for different metadata.

GMI in 2014 performed a pilot proficiency test with a limited number of laboratories to test the developed IT system and corresponding protocol. The GMI 2015 proficiency test was fully rolled out by December 15 (supported by the EU/COMPARE programme (www.compare-europe.eu) and the USFDA GenomeTrakr and Microbiologics\u00ae. This first global proficiency test in this area had a focus on Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and allowed for sign-up for each species separately (see www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org). 55 laboratories, from all continents, signed up for the test. The main objective of this proficiency test was to assess the feasibility of achieving reliable laboratory results of consistently good quality within the area of DNA preparation, sequencing, and analysis (e.g. for the use relative to phylogeny, MLST, resistance genes etc.). This will in time ensure or enable harmonization and standardization of whole genome sequencing and data analysis, with the final aim to produce comparable data for the GMI initiative, and thereby consistent data for the GMI database. A further objective is to assess and improve the data uploaded to databases such as NCBI, EBI and DDBJ. Therefore, the laboratory analysis work performed for this type of proficiency testing should be done employing the methods routinely used in the individual laboratories. The proficiency testing performed in this area has consisted of two wet-lab and one dry-lab components targeting Salmonella, E.\ncoli and S.\naureus. The wet-lab components assess the laboratories\u2019 ability to perform DNA preparation, sequencing procedures and analysis of epidemiological markers whereas the dry component assesses the ability to analyse a whole-genome-sequencing dataset and distinguish between clonally related and sporadic genomes. At present (September 2016) the GMI2016 proficiency testing is ongoing. The future vision of the proficiency testing is to target lower priority bacterial pathogens as well as to develop a parallel proficiency testing regime targeting viruses (http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org/News-and-Events/Previous-meetings/7th-Meeting-on-GMI\n).",

GMI aims to define the functional requirements for these tools from the perspective of end-users (clinical, public health, research) in terms of applications needed (identification, outbreak detection etc.) and priority microorganisms and diseases. To do so, GMI maps the currently available analytical software tools as well as developments in the field and benchmark them against the needs of GMI end-users in order to identify implementation gaps and projects that may fill those gaps. By this mapping effort and through software testing, GMI aims to construct a central portal of tools, to indicate a quality level, and state the usefulness and the user friendliness of the different tools for the different GMI end-users. Through this effort it will be possible to provide guidance for further development of (new) analytical tools.",

The goal of these pilots will be to help shape the process and the form that the GMI tools take, develop training skills and increase the participation level. In particular, this would be important to increase the participation level of members that currently lack the necessary laboratory capacity including members from many developing countries. These pilots will address several important issues and may help answer some important questions such as: How well does data transfer work? How well does data analysis, including species identification and outbreak clustering, work? What are the biggest challenges for coordinating an analysis that is highly dependent on metadata? What are the minimum standards required to run the system? And finally, what might be the gain in turn-around time?",

            "text": "Several already existing internet-based genomic tools and databases have been presented and discussed at GMI global meetings\u2014all of which are generally aimed at improving (inter)national detection and identification of different types of microorganisms. For instance, the global programme PulseNet compares the PFGE \u2018DNA fingerprints\u2019 of bacteria from patients to find clusters of disease that might represent unrecognized outbreaks (http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/). MLST-net can be used to compare various bacteria on the basis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis (http://www.mlst.net/). EuPathDB (http://eupathdb.org/eupathdb/) and ZoopNet [34] are portals for accessing genomic-scale and MLST datasets, respectively, which are associated with eukaryotic parasites. And NoroNet is a network of public health institutes and universities sharing virological, epidemiological and molecular data on norovirus and includes a tool for Norovirus identification and epidemiology on the basis of sequence comparison (http://www.rivm.nl/en/Topics/N/NoroNet). In contrast to GMI these earlier networks had to focus their effort on a single technique and often a limited group of microorganisms to make comparisons possible. With the arrival of cost-effective NGS and WGS this is no longer necessary; the different microbiological fields may now work together and different WGS analytical tools can be exchanged to maximize efficiency. Many of these earlier networks are now trying to make the move from traditional techniques to NGS. For example, PulseNet investigates how to use WGS and potentially metagenomics to replace PFGE and thus have a culture independent and faster technique (see: http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/next-generation.html). In such transitions it is important to implement new techniques in a way such that the old and new techniques are comparable and no data are lost.",
