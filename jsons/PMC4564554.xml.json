All animal work was approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of Intramural Research IACUC at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML). The facility is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All procedures were performed on animals after they were anesthetized by trained personnel under the supervision of veterinary staff.

            "text": "As described previously [28, 30], the N4CT1-HIVgag1 vector was used as template for generating all rVSV/EBOV vectors expressing EBOVGP. The N4CT1-HIVgag1 genomic cDNA was modified by exchanging the gag gene located in position 1 of the genome with the EBOVGP gene (1976, Mayinga isolate), generating N4CT1-EBOVGP1 cDNA (GP1; Figure 1A). A vector expressing a third-position EBOVGP (GP3; Figure 1A) was generated by inserting an expression cassette between the M and N genes. To insert the EBOVGP gene in genome position 6 (GP6; Figure 1A), the N and G genes were swapped and an expression cassette was positioned between VSV L and the trailer sequence. For adventitious agent testing of clinical trial material, large quantities of EBOVGP-specific neutralizing antibody are required to neutralize vaccine virus infectivity. To avoid this requirement, a gene expressing secreted EBOVGP was generated by deleting the sequence encoding the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail (aa 651\u2013676). This modified EBOVGP gene was inserted into position 1 of N4CT1 (GP1\u0394TM; Figure 1A). The mucin-like domain of EBOVGP spans aa 305\u2013485, and part of this domain (aa 374\u2013465) was deleted (GP1\u0394muc; Figure 1A). This modified EBOVGP gene was generated following observations that part of the mucin region was deleted upon multiple serial passage of N4CT1-EBOVGP1 on Vero cell monolayers and was included here to assess the effect of partial removal of the glycan \u201ccoat\u201d on EBOVGP immunogenicity. EBOVGP expression was analyzed by Western blotting for all vectors (Figure 1B). ",

The cell-mediated immune response was similar for secreted and anchored forms of EBOVGP, indicating that both forms of EBOVGP underwent a similar degree of processing and presentation of T-cell epitopes in antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the cell-mediated immune response to EBOVGP when part of the mucin-rich region was deleted, possibly as a result of altered proteosomal processing of EBOVGP or direct deletion of T-cell epitopes. After decay of the primary cell-mediated immune response, a second vaccine dose boosted ELISpot responses to levels seen after primary vaccination; however, there was still no detectable cell-mediated immune response elicited by vectors expressing EBOVGP from position 3 and 6, indicating the requirement for higher EBOVGP levels in infected cells to generate detectable EBOVGP-specific cell-mediated immune responses.",

            "text": "As expected, the EBOVGP-specific IgG response in mice was greatest for N4CT1-EBOVGP1 and N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394muc vectors expressing the highest levels of EBOVGP from genome position 1. Interestingly, N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394TM elicited much lower levels of EBOVGP-specific IgG than N4CT1-EBOVGP1. We speculate this may reflect differences in the tertiary and quaternary structure of secreted EBOVGP, compared with the trimeric conformation achieved by anchored EBOVGP. Notably, the secreted EBOVGP described here is different from the naturally occurring secreted form of EBOVGP that is translated from unedited EBOVGP mRNA [40]. The corollary is that anchored trimeric EBOVGP spikes on the surface of infected cells and virus particles present a dense array of structural epitopes that may interact more efficiently with B cells than soluble secreted EBOVGP, as is the case for other particulate antigen compositions [41, 42]. EBOVGP-specific IgG responses were highest for N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u0394muc [43], possibly reflecting better exposure of EBOVGP epitopes by removal of part of the carbohydrate cloak [44]. The N4CT1-EBOVGP3 vector also elicited a robust EBOVGP-specific IgG response, which contrasts with the undetectable EBOVGP-specific cell-mediated immune response induced by this vector. The explanation for this anomaly is unclear but could be due to relative differences in EBOVGP-specific cellular and humoral antigenicity. We believe the approximate 30% attenuation of expression across each gene junction could drop the EBOVGP level below a threshold required to elicit cell-mediated immune responses (N4CT1-EBOVGP3), while the EBOVGP level is still adequate to induce a relatively robust humoral response. However, for N4CT1-EBOVGP6, the EBOVGP-specific humoral response does decline markedly, presumably as a result of the calculated 85% reduction in EBOVGP expression when in the sixth position in the genome.",

However, Western blot data demonstrated that EBOVGP was present on the surface of virus particles when expressed by an rVSV vector that retained the VSV G gene (unpublished data). Therefore, a mouse NV study was performed to assess any changes in virulence arising from the possible alteration of vector tropism mediated by EBOVGP. Results confirmed the highly attenuated nature of N4CT1-EBOVGP1 in the mouse central nervous system, indicating that the presence of EBOVGP on the virion surface, in addition to VSV G protein, did not enhance virus spread in the brain, presumably because cells in the central nervous system lack the EBOVGP-specific receptor [45\u201347] and because virus using VSV G receptors remained attenuated as previously described [30].",

One dose of this vector protected guinea pigs from signs of disease following challenge with a lethal dose of GPA-EBOV. Interestingly, there was a slight delay in onset of the first signs of disease after challenge of wtVSV-vaccinated guinea pigs. One possible explanation is that induction of IFNs and other innate immune responses by rVSV [48, 49] leaves the guinea pig innate immune system on high alert, even 21 days after vaccination, resulting in a generalized antiviral state that may initially slow the GPA-EBOV infection [49, 50].",

An EBOVGP-specific IgG titer was detected in both immunized macaques prior to challenge and was expanded following EBOV challenge, indicating that a preexisting EBOVGP-specific antibody response is important for protection. Unfortunately cell-mediated immune responses in NHPs were not measured and may also contribute significantly to protection. The N4CT1-EBOVGP1 vector used in these challenge studies is similar to the highly attenuated N4CT1-gag1 vector that demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in 2 phase 1 clinical studies. The studies described here are the first to demonstrate protection of guinea pigs and macaques with a single dose of highly attenuated rVSV expressing EBOVGP, and we believe that the N4CT1-EBOVGP1 vector has the essential safety and efficacy characteristics for use in a vaccine to prevent EBOV infection in humans and the great apes. This highly attenuated vector platform will likely also have the potential to serve in a vaccine against other EBOV strains that cause disease in humans and apes. Ultimately, a multivalent EBOV vaccine may be possible by combining \u22652 vaccine vectors in a single vaccine formulation.",
