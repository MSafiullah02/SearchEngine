As of this writing, nearly 2.5 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified globally, with over 165,000 deaths reported to date [2] . It is generally believed that these are under-estimates, given continuing resource restrictions that preclude wide-spread testing in many countries. The range of manifestations of illness is expanding, with recent evidence of transmission by aerosol route in addition to droplet spread. Infections during pregnancy are increasingly being described, but the frequency and severity of infections in the newborn are incompletely defined. A critical and as yet unanswered question is whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in utero. The possibility of maternal-fetal transmission has been suggested by several observational studies, including the documentation of neonatal disease in some cases, reviewed below. Still, it remains uncertain whether these are post-natally acquired infections or represent vertically transmitted infections.",

            "text": "In this review, we summarize the state of knowledge acquired to date about potential risks of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the fetus and newborn. By analogy with animal models of coronavirus disease, congenital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible, and this literature is reviewed. The possibility of analogous congenital transmission of coronaviruses in humans requires continued study. Perinatal and postnatal environmental routes of transmission appear to be clear risks to the newborn infant, and measures to prevent the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 in this setting are warranted. Reassuring information has been reported that suggests a lack of breast milk-mediated transmission [3, 4] , although this needs to be confirmed by more extensive studies. Of considerable interest is the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 should be considered as a \"TORCH\" infection. The TORCH acronym, first coined by Nahmias [5] , was initially defined as a group of infections (toxoplasmosis, \"other\" infections, rubella, CMV, and herpes simplex virus [HSV] ) that were commonly encountered in the newborn and acquired from a maternal source. Numerous variants of this acronym have evolved over the past four decades [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , and the definition of TORCH infection is today more broadly recognized as a heterologous collection of infections that can cause neonatal disease following acquisition by either trans-placental or perinatal routes. We submit that SARS-CoV-2 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104372 Received 8 April 2020; Accepted 11 April 2020 should be included in the grouping of TORCH infections and that efforts should be made both to more fully define the mechanisms of transmission and the scope of disease in the fetus and neonate. Strategies to prevent transmission, including virologic monitoring of pregnant women, are likely to be of great value. Therapeutic interventions to prevent transmission in the newborn period, including vaccines and immunotherapies, also warrant investigation.",

Murine coronavirus (M-CoV) is a species of coronavirus which infects mice, and experiments using a virulent strain of this virus in a pregnancy/challenge model demonstrated infection of both placenta and fetus in susceptible BALB/cByJ mice [15, 16] . Fetuses were infected during all three trimesters of pregnancy, although there was variation among different strains of mice, insofar as infection of resistant CD-1 mice was limited, with no fetal infection [16] . Betaarterivirus suid 1 virus (formerly known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus) is a porcine arterivirus related to coronaviruses and was commonly associated with early fetal demise in pigs in another study following challenge during pregnancy [17] . Infection of cats with the coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus results in newborn kittens becoming carriers of the virus [18] . Interestingly (and paradoxically), increased morbidity compared to controls was observed in kittens born to queens pre-sensitized with a vaccinia virus-vectored spike (S) protein vaccine, following challenge with feline infectious peritonitis [19] . The mechanism of increased mortality in the vaccine group was not clear but may be related to vaccine-induced immune enhancement of infection [20] . Antibody-mediated enhancement of coronavirus entry into Fc receptor-expressing cells has been described for antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the MERS coronavirus [21] . These observations may be relevant to COVID-19 vaccines as they move forward in clinical evaluation.",

A recent review and summary of COVID-19 cases [38] , chiefly compiled from those published in a series of reports from China [39] [40] [41] [42] , described 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns and included information on clinical, laboratory and virologic data. This analysis revealed that, unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in the 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 there were no maternal deaths. Signs and symptoms of illness were described in some infants born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, including shortness of breath, fever, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, tachycardia, vomiting, and pneumothorax [41] ; one infant born prematurely (at an estimated gestational age of 34 weeks) died due to refractory shock, multiple organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Despite evidence of illness in some newborns, it was noted that there had been no virologic evidence of newborn infection, and no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers.",

            "text": "After this review was published, another analysis of COVID-19 cases examined the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19, and 46 neonates, reported in the literature and also concluded that there was no definite evidence of vertical transmission [43] . Other reports and small case series have provided similar reassuring observations [44, 45] . However, standing in contrast to these reassuring observations are a series of more recent case reports that seem to document that vertical (in utero) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can indeed occur. In one study reported from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in China, six women with mild COVID-19 disease gave birth via Caesarean section to infants using multiple infection control measures, including isolation of their infants immediately following delivery. Notably, two of these six infants had IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 present, although neither infant had symptoms. All of these infants were repeatedly negative when tested for viral RNA upon subsequent testing [46] , leaving only the demonstration of IgM antibody as a marker defining fetal transmission. In a second report from Wuhan hospital [47] , viral nucleic acid testing made for a more compelling case for vertical transmission. This analysis of 33 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 identified three neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In one infant, chest radiographic image showed pneumonia within 48 h of age, and nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on days 2 and 4 of life. A second infant born to a woman with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia developed lethargy, vomiting, and fever. A chest radiographic image revealed pneumonia, and nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on days 2 and 4 of life. The third patient was born at 31 weeks gestation by Cesarean delivery; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia were confirmed by chest radiographic image on admission, and nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on days 2 and 4 of life (and negative on day 7). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 was not only transmitted vertically, but caused disease in the infected newborns. A third study [48] also demonstrated a positive IgM serology in a neonate born by Cesarean section to a mother with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The infant was delivered in a negative-pressure isolation room, and her mother wore an N95 mask and did not hold the infant. The positive IgM titer in the newborn, along with an elevated cytokine profile, suggested vertical transmission had occurred, although nucleic acid studies were negative.",

Non-congenital routes of perinatal transmission could include aerosol and droplet transmission in the delivery room, or transmission in the birth canal. Another important possible route of post-natal transmission could be through breastfeeding. Studies reported to date do not find any evidence of COVID-19 in breast milk [38, [49] [50] [51] , although more studies are needed. Both intrapartum transmission during vaginal delivery and post-natal acquisition via breast milk are well-described for CMV infection [52] . These modes of transmission may complicate the analysis of whether an infant undergoing assessment for congenital CMV may have acquired infection in utero versus post-natally. Clinicians should learn lessons from these congenital/perinatal CMV infection considerations, and be mindful that these same issues may complicate the question of whether an infant with SARS-CoV-2 acquires infection by a pre-natal versus a post-natal route.",

The various studies reported to date are summarized in Table 1 . It is also uncertain what measures should inform guidelines about the separation of a COVID-19 positive mother and her newborn infant, given inconsistent recommendations across expert groups [53] . At this time, the WHO advises that infected mothers can share a room with their infant and breastfeed but should practice \"respiratory hygiene\", including washing their hands and wearing a mask, acknowledging that a mask might not be available. The CDC [54] advises that facilities should \"consider temporarily\" separating infected mothers and newborns after \"discussing the risks and benefits with the mother and health care team.\" Mothers may breastfeed while exercising respiratory hygiene, and separated infants must be isolated from other infants. The CDC also makes provisions for room sharing if \"it is in accordance with the mother's wishes\" or if it is unavoidable due to facility limitations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) defers to CDC guidelines; in addition, ACOG does not recommend routine COVID-19 testing for pregnant women [55] . The American Academy of Pediatrics, on the other hand, offers more stringent guidelines, including the recommendation that COVID-19 positive mothers be separated from their newborns until they are asymptomatic, and until they have two separate virological determinations demonstrating that they are free of infection [56] . These inconsistencies in expert recommendations underscore the knowledge gaps that exist regarding perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and highlight high priority areas for future studies.",

The fact that SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to produce RNAemia [58] further suggests the biological plausibility of transplacental transmission by a mother-tofetus hematogenous route. SARS-CoV-2 can also be found in fecal samples [59] , suggesting that perineal colonization could lead to intrapartum infection of the newborn during labor and delivery. Reports from China suggest, based on limited assessment of IgM serology and virologic samples in neonates, that vertical transmission of virus does occur in some cases [46] [47] [48] . On the other hand, a recent report from Columbia University in New York found no evidence for vertical transmission in 43 COVID-19-positive pregnant women: moreover, this study also demonstrated that a high percentage (32.6 %) of infected women were, in fact, asymptomatic upon their original clinical presentation [60] . Increased availability of testing, including real-time \"point-of-care\" testing, should help clarify the risks of transmission to the fetus. High-priority areas for future studies are highlighted in Table 2 . Foremost among these will be the determination of potential modes of transmission in the newborn periodi.e., transplacental versus intrapartum versus postpartum. The finding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the first few days of life could represent bona fide congenital infection, acquired before birth; transient colonization acquired during labor and delivery; or post-natal acquisition via droplet spread from an infected mother. Strategies must be enhanced to differentiate among these possibilities. The issue of breastmilk transmission also requires further study. Examination of placentas from COVID-19 positive women for virologic and histologic markers of infection should be a high-priority area for investigation. Maternal and nenonatal biomarkers (possibly IL-6 [46] ) that correlate with maternofetal transmission should also be studied. Optimal infection control procedures in the newborn period must be defined toward the goal of resolving the best strategies to prevent post-natal infection. Finally, the pregnant patient should be considered a top priority recipient of candidate vaccines and immunotherapies. It is premature to recommend antivirals or immunebased therapies (such as monoclonal or polyclonal anti-COVID 19 antibodies) aimed at interrupted perinatal transmission, but such strategies deserve consideration; in this context, efforts that have been considered and studied to block CMV transmission during pregnancy can be highly instructive [61] . Ultimately, an effective vaccine [62] is of the highest priority. A vaccine will not only protect maternal health during pregnancy and delivery, but also can likely minimize the risk of fetal and neonatal infection by potentially inducing transplacental antibodies that may help prevent infection from other household and community exposures. Vaccines stand the best chance for reducing the risk of both in utero transmission, and post-natal mother-to-infant transmission in the newborn period.",
