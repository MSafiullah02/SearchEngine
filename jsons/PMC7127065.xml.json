            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious disease of all age groups of chicken and affects primarily the respiratory system with possible infection of renal and reproductive systems [1,2]. It is a disease of global importance and listed in the world organization for animal health (OIE) diseases. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent of IB, belongs to the genus Coronavirus, family Coronoviridae, of order Nidovirales [3]. Vaccination with live attenuated and inactivated vaccines is the mainstay tool to control the IB [4]. As IBV enters the host through the mucosal surfaces and replicates in the epithelial cells, vaccines inducing mucosal immunity can prevent the entry of the pathogen before establishment of infection [5]. Studies indicate that local administration of attenuated IBV vaccines is effective as compared to systemic administration implying that respiratory mucosal immunity is essential for protection [[6], [7], [8]]. In fact, an increase in the lachrymal-fluid IgA levels in chickens increases the resistance against IBV infection [9] and re-infection [10]. Further, in the inbred chicken lines, resistance to IBV was correlated with higher IgA levels in the tear and saliva [11].",

            "text": "Limited number of adjuvants is available with the capacity to enhance antigen specific mucosal immunity. Conventional mucosal adjuvants like heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from E. coli and cholera toxin (CT) from Vibrio cholerae are toxic to the host [12]. Owing to the immunostimulatory capacity, Toll- like receptor (TLR) agonists are explored as an alternate and promising source for future adjuvant systems [13]. TLRs are evolutionary conserved germ line encoded receptors present in the different cells of various species like human, mice and chicken [14,15]. Emerging evidence supports the notion that the TLR agonists increase the secretory IgA (sIgA) when used with the vaccine antigens [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. LPS, a TLR4 agonist, when used with inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine significantly increased the mucosal and humoral immune responses [20]. Flagellin [21] and combination of CpG and poly I:C [22] increased the sIgA titres along with systemic immune responses in chicken with avian influenza virus vaccine. Resiquimod (R-848) (TLR7/8 agonist) and gardiquimod (TLR7 agonist) enhanced sIgA response besides cellular and humoral responses when used with virus like particles (VLPs) based Norwalk virus vaccine in the mice [17]. The response seen is equivalent to that seen when cholera toxin is used as adjuvant with the same antigen. Co-delivery of Norwalk VLPs with gardiquimod (TLR7 agonist) or CpG ODN (TLR9 agonist) produced strong systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the mice [23]. Recently, we reported the adjuvant potential of R-848 in the chicken when used with inactivated NDV vaccine [24]. However, the effect of R-848 on the mucosal immune response is not explored in the chicken hitherto. Accordingly, we investigated the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses of live or inactivated IBV vaccine in the chicken when adjuvanted with R-848.",

            "text": "There is a need for adjuvants that increase antigen specific mucosal immune response to curtail the infection at the entry level [41]. Despite the fact that the local CTLs are essential for the virus clearance in early infection [42], sIgA of lacrimal origin is a good indicator of protection in IBV infection [9,43,44] as mucosal antibody response resists reinfection [6]. R-848 enhanced the sIgA response in the tear (Fig. 2) as well as intestinal secretions (Fig. 3) when adjuvanted with live or inactivated IBV vaccine. In support of the findings, it is reported that the administration of R-848 with VLPs of Norwalk virus enhanced the mucosal IgA response in the mice [17]. To explain the impressive sIgA response, we studied the relative expression of TGF-\u03b24 as it has a major role in the induction of IgA class switching [45]. It is well known that TGF-\u03b21, which is the orthologue of TGF-\u03b24, is primarily responsible for class switching of B cells to produce IgA in the mammals [[46], [47], [48], [49], [50]]. A significant increase in the relative copy number of TGF-\u03b24 (Fig. 6) suggests a role of R-848 in IgA class switching in the groups that received live or inactivated IBV vaccine. In this study, the TGF-\u03b24 transcripts were significantly higher in vaccine plus R-848 groups than that of the respective vaccine alone groups. Activation of TLR7 by R-848 would initiate the signaling cascade through the MyD88-dependent pathway, which might have resulted in the up-regulation of TGF-\u03b24 transcripts [51]. Studies by our group have shown that R-848 improves the vaccine response of NDV when adjuvanted [24] and has prophylactic potential against IBDV [29]. Thus, the adjuvant effect of R-848 with IBV is needed to be tested following challenge studies.",
