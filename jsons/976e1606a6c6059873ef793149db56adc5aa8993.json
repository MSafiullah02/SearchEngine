Cleavage between the VPg and Pro domains is inefficient in vitro and in E. coli, resulting in the accumulation of the VPg-Pro. In this study, we have compared the trans-activity of the Pro and VPg-Pro on various P1-and P2-derived precursors. Recombinant Pro and VPg-Pro were partially purified using an E. coli expression system. A mutation of the VPg-Pro cleavage site was introduced into the VPg-Pro to prevent slow release of the Pro. The Pro was five to ten times more active than the VPg-Pro on two P2 cleavage sites (at the N-and C-termini of the movement protein domain) and was approximately two times more active than the VPg-Pro on the third P2 cleavage site (between the X3 and X4 domains). Neither the Pro nor the VPg-Pro could cleave in trans P1-derived substrates containing the three cleavage sites delineating the X1, X2, putative NTP-binding protein and VPg domains. These results are discussed in light of the possible regulation of the proteinase activity during virus replication. Crown",

            "text": "Proteolytic processing of precursor polyproteins is a key step in the replication cycle of many viruses. It is tightly regulated, allowing step-wise release of precursor and mature forms of the viral proteins (for reviews see Dougherty and Semler, 1993; Spall et al., 1997) . The picornavirus 3C proteinases (3C-Pro) and the related 3C-like proteinases from coronaviruses, potyviruses, comoviruses and nepoviruses are a well-studied group of enzymes that have structural homology to chymotrypsin (Bazan and Fletterick, 1988; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Allaire et al., 1994; Matthews et al., 1994; Mosimann et al., 1997) . Proteolytic processing efficiency at different 3C-Pro and 3C-like-Pro cleavage sites in the viral polyproteins can vary widely. Predominant cleavage sites are generally characterized by a conserved amino acid sequence at the cleavage site (Dougherty et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989; Pallai et al., 1989) and by favorable secondary structure of the protein around the cleavage site (Ypma-Wong et al., 1988b) . Additional mechanisms also contribute to the regulation of the proteinase activity at specific cleavage sites. In comoviruses, a co-factor increases the activity of the proteinase on some cleavage sites but decreases its activity on other sites (Peters et al., 1992a,b) . In poliovirus, the activity of the 3C-Pro is regulated by the presence of the 3D domain on intermediate precursors (Ypma-Wong et al., 1988a; Jore et al., 1988) and by the interaction of the 3C-Pro with the 3AB protein (Molla et al., 1994) . In two nepoviruses of subgroups A and B, the presence of the VPg domain on partially processed precursors of the proteinase was shown to modulate the activity of the proteinase although the specific effect of the VPg domain on the proteinase activity differed between the two viruses considered (Margis et al., 1994; Hemmer et al., 1995) .",

Plasmid pET21d-Pro was derived from the intermediate plasmid by performing in vitro mutagenesis (Fisher and Pei, 1997) using primers JC-1 (5% CACCACCACCACCACCACTGAG 3%, from the pET21d vector sequence, Novagen) and 39 (5% CTGGCAAGGAGCAAAAGAAG 3%, corresponding to nts 4535-4515 on ToRSV RNA1, numbering according to Rott et al., 1995) and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). This removed the DNA sequence corresponding to the N-terminal region of the polymerase gene and introduced the His(x6) tag in frame with the C-terminus of the proteinase. Plasmid pET21d-VPg-Pro was derived from plasmid pET15b-VPg-Pro-N-Pol (Wang et al., 1999) in a similar manner using primers JC-1 and 39 as above.

To construct plasmid pT7-cX1-X2, a 1151 bp fragment of a full-length clone of RNA1 (plasmid pMR10, Rott et al., 1995) was amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and earlier described oligonucleotides W034 (corresponding to RNA1 nts 786-801 and engineered to include a NcoI site; Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000) and W027 (complementary to RNA1 nts 1922-1937 and engineered to include a SalI site). The amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and SalI and inserted in the corresponding sites of plasmid pCITE-4a(+) (Novagen). The sequence of all plasmids was verified by automated sequencing (Perkin-Elmer) using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer.",

To produce substrate X2-NTB, plasmid pT7-X2-Pro (Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000) was digested with XhoI (located at nt 3393 on ToRSV RNA1), and run-off transcripts were synthesized in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase (Gibco-BRL) as described earlier (Hans and Sanfa\u00e7on, 1995) . The run-off transcript was then used as a template in the standard rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) as described earlier (Hans and Sanfa\u00e7on, 1995) . Proteolytic processing of the substrates was tested by adding exogenous proteinase to the in vitro translation products. Proteolytic processing reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mM DTT; 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 10% glycerol. The reactions were stopped by the addition of one volume of (2\u00d7 ) SDS-PAGE sample buffer (120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 4% SDS; 20% glycerol; 10% b-mercaptoethanol; 0.02% bromophenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Time-course experiments were conducted using several dilutions of the proteinase to ensure that the reactions were in the linear range. The gels were scanned using a Phos-phorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of radioactivity in individual bands was measured using ImageQuant as described by the supplier. The cpm values were adjusted for the number of methionine residues present in each protein. The percentage of precursor that was converted to one of the cleaved products (32 kDa MP for the MP-CAT precursor, 38 kDa MP for the X4-MP precursors and 38.5 kDa X3 for the X3-X4 precursor) was calculated at each time point as earlier described in Carrier et al. (1999) . The cleavage products chosen for this calculation met the following two criteria: the product was stable over time and it migrated in an area of the gel devoid of contaminating background bands. Very similar results were obtained when the calculation was made with the other cleavage product (data not shown). In the case of the X4-MP precursor only the predominant precursor is considered in the calculation. As earlier mentioned , other minor precursors were also produced by internal translation initiation and similar processing kinetics were obtained when these precursors were also considered in the calculation (data not shown). In experiments, where the effect of temperature or pH on the activity of the Pro and VPg-Pro was tested, the proteinases were first preincubated at the appropriate temperature or in the appropriate buffer for 30 min prior to the addition of the MP-CAT substrate.",

Under all temperatures tested, most of the expressed protein was found in the insoluble fraction of the extract from induced bacterial cells (data not shown). However, at lower temperatures (25\u00b0C), some protein remained in the soluble fraction. Recombinant proteinase was purified from the soluble fraction as described in Section 2. The degree of purity of the proteinase obtained by this method was 80-90% after purification using Ni + 2 -NTA-agarose (as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis, see Fig. 3 ) and the yield was 50-100 mg of purified Preliminary results using plasmid pET21d-VPg-Pro revealed that slow processing of the VPg-Pro precursor occurred at the VPg-Pro cleavage site when expression was performed at low temperatures (25\u00b0C) allowing the release of small amounts of the mature Pro (data not shown). Slow processing at the VPg-Pro cleavage site of a larger precursor (pET15b-VPg-Pro-N-Pol, see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A) containing the N-terminal region of the polymerase was also earlier shown (Wang et al., 1999) . To eliminate this processing and ensure that the VPg-Pro preparation did not contain trace amounts of the mature proteinase, a mutation was introduced at the \u2212 1 position of proteinase per liter of culture. Preparations of recombinant proteinase were tested for their proteolytic activity using the earlier described MP-CAT substrate which contains the MP-CP cleavage site (Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000) . As shown earlier, incubation of the MP-CAT precursor with the recombinant proteinase resulted in the production of two additional proteins that corresponded to the cleaved MP and the CP-CAT proteins (see below). Mutated recombinant proteinases (i.e. containing a His to Asp substitution in the putative catalytic triad or a His to Leu substitution in the putative substrate binding pocket) purified using the same method were not active on the MP-CAT substrate (data not shown). This demonstrated that the activity observed with the wild-type recombinant proteinase was not due to an E. coli protease contaminating the preparation. Recombinant proteinase was also purified from the insoluble fraction and resolubilized by progressive dialysis in decreasing concentration of urea. Although highly purified proteinase was obtained by this method, the specific activity of the proteinase was ten to a hundred times less than that obtained with the proteinase purified from the soluble fraction suggesting that only a portion of the molecules were properly refolded (data not shown).

The molecular masses of the Pro and VPg-Pro differed by only 10% (27 kDa for Pro and 30 kDa for VPg-Pro). Therefore, equivalent amounts of each proteinase (in ng) were initially used to compare their activities. The Pro was found to be considerably more active than the VPg-Pro on the MP-CAT substrate (Fig. 5B ). To determine more precisely the relative processing activities of the Pro and VPg-Pro, time-course experiments were conducted on serial dilutions of several individual proteinase preparations to ensure that the reactions were in the linear range.

To investigate the possibility that the ToRSV VPg-Pro may possess a similar activity, in vitro trans-processing assays were conducted with the purified VPg-Pro (Q 1264 to A).

The preference for lower temperatures was similar to that observed for the Turnip mosaic 6irus (TuMV, genus Poty6irus) NIa proteinase (Kim et al., 1996) but differed from that observed for 3C or 3C-like proteinases from animal viruses [for example the Mengo 6irus (genus Cardio6irus) 3C proteinase exhibits an optimal temperature of 37\u00b0C, see Hall and Palmenberg, 1996] .

However, we were unsuccessful in detecting these proteins in total extracts or in membrane-enriched fractions from ToRSV-infected cucumber or Nicotiana benthamiana plants. This could be explained by a low concentration of these proteins in the plant or by specific modifications of these proteins in plants that preclude their recognition by the antibodies used in this study. At this point, we can only speculate that the VPg-Pro may be the predominant form of proteinase activity early during the course of infection although we cannot exclude the possibility that plant factors may influence the processing of the P1 polyprotein by increasing cleavage at the VPg-Pro site. Assuming that initial polyprotein processing of P1 in vivo parallels that observed in vitro, the slow release of the mature proteinase from the VPg-Pro precursor may provide a mechanism by which cis-cleavage of the P1 polyprotein at the Pro-Pol site is favored early in infection allowing the release of proteins involved in viral replication while trans-cleavage of the P2 polyprotein is more efficient later in infection allowing the release of the movement protein and coat protein, and subsequently of the X3 and X4 proteins.",

            "text": "Differential proteolytic activities in precursor and mature forms of the proteinase have also been shown for related nepoviruses. Indeed, the GFLV VPg-Pro was found to be less active than the Pro on RNA2-encoded cleavage sites and more active than the Pro on an RNA1-encoded cleavage site (Margis et al., 1994) . However, in contrast with the ToRSV proteinase, the presence of the VPg domain on precursors containing the GFLV proteinase did not influence the cis-processing of the Pro-Pol cleavage site but instead, increased trans-processing at the cleavage site upstream of the NTB domain. Interestingly, in the case of another nepovirus (TBRV), the VPg domain was also shown to modulate the activity of the proteinase (Hemmer et al., 1995) . The presence of the VPg domain on precursors containing the TBRV proteinase resulted in increased transcleavage of RNA2-encoded cleavage sites and increased cis-cleavage at the Pro-Pol site. These results suggest that nepoviruses share common mechanisms to regulate the processing of the RNA1 and RNA2-encoded polyproteins through the accumulation of proteinase precursors containing the VPg domain. However, these results also suggest that there are many variations on this theme, i.e. the effect of the VPg domain on the proteinase activity varies from one nepovirus to another. Interestingly, in potyviruses, although both the VPg-Pro (NIa) and the Pro (NIa-Pro) accumulate in plants, no differential activity was observed between them (Parks et al., 1992) . Therefore, modulation of the proteinase activity by the VPg domain may be a characteristic feature of nepoviruses.",
