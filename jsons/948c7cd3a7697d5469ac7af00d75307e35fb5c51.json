To make sense of the millions of available tracks (e.g., 40 million on Apple Music and 30 million on Spotify), playlists have become an essential feature of many music streaming platforms for organizing music, mediating how users experience the service. Across platforms, most playlists are manually curated and managed by a group of music curators, which consists of both \"regular\" users and expert tastemakers. To benefit from the power of human curation [15] , many platforms enable users to follow these music curators to receive updates of their listening activities, e.g., to discover new tracks, albums, or playlists (as illustrated in Fig. 1(a) ).",

            "text": "identifying personally-relevant music curators is a daunting task due to the following challenges. First, music curators themselves are complex amalgamations of the playlists they create, the tracks they select, and their unique style. For example, some curators may focus on specific emotions (like happy or excited), eras (like the 80s or 90s), or situations (like workouts, parties, or road trips), while others cross boundaries (like happy 80s music, or 90s road trip). Hence the first challenge is: How can we build models that capture these stylistic differences across music curators taking both their curating coverage and individual style into consideration? To illustrate, we conduct an initial exploration of Spotify curators whose areas of interest can be inferred from their user IDs. We represent each of the music curators using the average of audio features (see Sect. 3.2 for details) for all the tracks in playlists they curate and plot the 2D t-SNE distribution in Fig. 1(b) . We see that there are clear patterns of curator coverage: country music curators cluster together in the top-right, curators focusing on active music for sports and workouts cluster in the top-left, while classical and instrumental music curators dominate the lower portion. We see that curators have preferences in the coverage of music they would curate. However, coverage alone is insufficient to distinguish between curators. We must also consider individual style. Considering the playlists curated by three classical music curators (in the bottom of the figure), while all drawing from the same musical coverage area, each of them displays a unique style -one groups tracks for activities like work or study, one collects tracks featuring the same instrument, while the third groups by artists. We see that curators who curate similar types of music can have different style in deciding how tracks go with each other.",

These preferences may only be revealed through extremely sparse user feedback. For example, in a sample of Spotify playlists (see Sect. 4.1) we find that only 0.20% of all user-curator pairs have a following relationship. And for pairs without a following relationship, it may mean the user dislikes the curator or just has not known her yet. Furthermore, because anyone can be a curator on these platforms, there are many long-tail candidate curators who may be invisible to most users. Hence the second challenge is: How can we uncover the hidden taste preferences that connect users to the music curators they may prefer?",

Through experiments over a Spotify dataset, we find the proposed framework results in a 20.5% and 5.7% improvement in top-k F1 score compared to Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and Neural Personalized Ranking (NPR), and in a 24.9% and 21.4% improvement in cold start scenarios.",

Groove Radio [1] generates personalized playlists based on seed artists. EFM [2] recommends both tracks and playlists through a new embedding approach. There are also efforts on training an embedding model on users' historical music playing sequences to estimate the similarity between songs for recommendation [5, 24] .

            "text": "As shown in the previous section, curators have their own style in deciding how tracks go together. For example, some classical music lovers may create playlists based on the time period (e.g., 1800 s) or for different artists. Some may focus on the particular instrument featured, while others may curate based on feelings, activities (e.g., for studying or focusing), or locations (e.g., for \"coffee shop\"). Modeling these styles is important for accurately connecting users to their preferred curators. A purely content-based approach to model style (e.g., based on composer, time period, or audio features of the track) may face challenges in determining these subtle stylistic choices that motivate a curator. Hence, we propose to model curation style through a pairwise framework intended to discern why a curator chooses one track over another. Given tracks t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 , curator c may put t 1 and t 2 in the same list while putting t 3 in a different list. We propose a neural network (see Fig. 2 (a)) to simulate how curators choose what tracks go in what playlists. By iterating among and across playlists of different curators, we can generate input tuples to represent their behaviors in assigning tracks to playlists. Each input tuple has three components: the index of the curator, the features representing t 1 , and the features representing t 2 . If curator c puts t 1 and t 2 into the same playlist (a positive pair), then the ground truth of prediction is set to be 1. However, if t 1 and t 2 appear in different playlists of curator c (a negative pair), then the ground truth is set to be 0. We can then train a binary classification model to predict how curators will relate two tracks during curation. The intermediate embedding layer of this modele style c -can then characterize curator c's curation style.",

After feeding the input tuple < c, F t1 , F t2 > to the neural network, to learn the representation of c's curation style, the vector i c is passed to the embedding layer: e style to represent the cosine distance between them. Then the concatenated vector will be fully connected to a dense layer activated with ReLU function. Finally a onedimension output is generated as the prediction of likelihood that t 1 and t 2 will be in the same playlist by curator c. Binary cross-entropy is used to calculate the training loss.

            "text": "A natural question raised in the last section is how to model individual tracks in the first place? One alternative is to use the audio features of music tracks. For example, there are 13 audio features provided by Spotify, including danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechless, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration in ms, and time signature. However, these features are not always available due to the cost of analyzing audio signals. Instead, we seek to characterize tracks by how groups of curators compose their playlists. The intuition is that when users create or follow playlists, they provide implicit linkages between tracks in the same playlist. Hence, a key hypothesis is that tracks in a particular playlist are in high coherence, regardless of their underlying audio-based signature. Inspired by word2vec [17] , we propose to learn a vector representation for each track from the curationbased perspective of how tracks cohere with other tracks. We can treat tracks as \"words\" and find neighboring tracks within a window. In many music services, users can shuffle the playlists, meaning that tracks arrive in a random order. Hence, tracks within a playlist will have high coherence, regardless of their immediate order in the playlist. To simulate this shuffle activity, we randomly reorder the music tracks in each playlist to generate the shuffled track sequences (see Fig. 2(b) ). Then we treat each shuffled track sequence as a \"sentence\" and each music track as a \"word\". For instance, given a music sequence (similar to a \"sentence\") m = (t 1 , t 2 , ...t |m| ), the log probability l m is calculated as l m = 1 |m| 0\u2264k<|m| \u2212w\u2264j\u2264w,j =0 log P (t k+j |t k ), where P (t k+j |t k ) represents the probability that track t k+j is the neighbor of t k , given that track t k is listened. Here, w is the window size in observing neighboring tracks. This skip-gram model aims to maximize the log probability across the set of all generated track \"sentences\". The hidden layer (in Fig. 2(b) ) that is learned will be used as the low-dimensional vector representations for tracks. Tracks with larger pairwise-similarity are more likely to be listened to together from the perspective of how curators create their playlists. After generating the embedding representation E t for each track t, we can use it as track features for curation style embedding in Fig. 2(a) and coverage in Eq. 1.",

First, we model the direct preference relationships between users and curators. i u and i c are connected to the corresponding embedding layers to learn the compact and vectorized representations. The resulting embeddings e u and e c act as the latent factors of u and c. To simulate the traditional matrix factorization, we calculate the element-wise product e u \u2022 e c , which captures the interaction between u and c. Then we need to determine how a user's preferences are aligned with each curator's coverage and style. We use ReLU function to activate curator c's auxiliary features. The activated coverage and style of curator c are denoted as r c and s c . Given the one-hot encoding of user u as i u , u's preferences on coverage and style are learned by the corresponding embedding layers r u = W r i u and s u = W s i u , where W r and W s are the embedding weight matrices for coverage and style. The resulting embeddings share the same size with the coverage and style features of curators. We use the element-wise multiplications to capture user u's preferences on curator c. We will concatenate all the element-wise products together to represent the preference of u on c and get p uc = [e u \u2022 e c r u \u2022 r c s u \u2022 s c ] T . Then this concatenation is passed to a fully connected layer. The one-dimension output from this layer can be represented as r uc = f (Wp uc +b). Here f (\u00b7) denotes the ReLU function. W is the weight matrix and b is the bias term for the single perceptron. The output r uc represents the preference score of u on c. Because the model is symmetric, r uq , the preference score of u on curator q, is calculated in the same process with the other branch (the transparent part in Fig. 3) . Thus we apply a subtraction layer to estimate the difference between u's preferences on curator c and q: d(u, c, q) = r uc \u2212r uq . Since our objective is to make d(u, c, q) share the same sign as y(u, c, q), we train the entire model to minimize the loss: d(u, c, q)\u00b7y(u, c, q) )), in which V is the set of training tuples and \u03b4 is the sigmoid function. If the product d(u, c, q) \u00b7 y(u, c, q) is larger, it means that u's preference for the curator pair (c, q) is more likely to be predicted correctly by the model.

For the curator style embedding, we randomly pick 10 tracks from each playlist and iterate among all playlists to get the positive tuples. Then for each curator, we iterate across playlists he/she creates to generate negative tuples. We keep the number of positive tuples and the number of negative tuples to be the same for each curator by random sampling. With this method, we generate a training set and a validation set with the same size. We train the model for 20 epochs, with the loss generally converging within 10 epochs. We use the intermediate embedding layer in the well-trained model to represent a curator's style. For the curation-based track embeddings, we set the window and feature vector size following the default settings of Gensim [20] . We adopt Adam optimizer and mini-batch approach of gradient descent, in which the batch size is 3072. We grid search the regularization parameters over {1, 10 \u22121 , ...10 \u22126 } in the validation set. We set the dimension of latent factors for \"following\" feedback to be 100 for all the models. The dimensions of coverage based on track embeddings and curation style embedding e style are also set to be 100. We keep them to be the same for fair comparison. To train the pairwise ranking model, we select 5 negative curators (unfollow/unobserved) for each user to construct the training tuples; we find that increasing these negative samples leads to longer training time but little improvement on recommendation quality. Exploring Curator Style. Firstly, we want to explore what the style embeddings discover about curators. Although users may not create playlists themselves, they can reveal their \"curation style\" by following different playlists. For a user u, we calculate the cosine similarity of the curation style embedding between u and two different sets of curators: (i) we select the set of K curators u is following; and (ii) we randomly select K curators. We summarize the results for all the users in Fig. 4 . We observe that users have a higher similarity with curators they follow rather than random curators. Thus, we see that users do have clear preferences based on style, and there exists clear pattern of users sharing style with curators.",

We see that the proposed MCR approach results in the highest precision, recall and F1 for k = 5, 10, 15. Beginning on the left-side of each figure, we see that user-based collaborative filtering (UCF) performs the worst. Since this curation network is so sparse, users have provided insufficient implicit feedback for this recommender to figure out their similarities purely based on the curators they followed. Applying matrix factorization to find latent factors for both users and curators, BPR can outperform UCF by 11.9% on average for the top-k recall and precision, though it still lags the neural models. Relative to traditional collaborative filtering, we see that BPR's relaxed assumption of users' unobserved implicit feedback and pairwise ranking model is more effective for this task. Perhaps surprisingly, the Most Popular (MP) recommender performs slightly better than both UCF and BPR. Currently, Spotify suggests users with popular verified curators and friends on Facebook. Thus, although MP can result in better precision and recall than BPR and UCF, it necessarily ignores the long-tail challenge of uncovering curators who are not widely known.",

Firstly, we observe that curation-based track embeddings (C-MCR) perform better than the audio-based features (A-MCR) in characterizing a curator's coverage. The track embeddings are learned from curation choices with skip-gram embedding model to extract the collective wisdom of curators, while the audiobased track features relying on audio analysis of individual tracks.

Combining both of these features leads to an average improvement of 21.4% in F1 score. For each of the features and their combination, we see larger improvements compared with the original setting.
