Presently, this disease, a pandemic as announced by the WHO, is a major health concern [2] . The family of coronaviruses is enclosed by different CoVs which are a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA 5 genome of size approximately 26-32 kb [3] . The CoVs are classified into four genera, the \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b2-CoVs, \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs [4] . One of most important genera of coronaviruses is the \u03b2-CoVs where the present SARS-CoV2 belongs [5] . The \u03b2-CoVs mainly infect humans, bats including other animals such as camels, and rabbits and so on [6] . Two-third of the SARS-CoV2 genomes from 5' end is conserved for the ORF1 gene which encodes sixteen polyproteins and the 3' ends 10 contains various structural protein coding genes including surface (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [7] . In addition there are six accessory protein coding genes such as ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 also present in the SARS-CoV2 genome [8] .",

The envelope (E) proteins play multiple roles during infection, including virus morphogenesis [11, 12] . The N protein encoded by the gene N plays a vital role in the virus morphogenesis and assembly [13, 14] . The M gene encodes the M protein which plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins [15, 16] . It does determine the shapes of the virions, promotes membrane 20 curvature. The M gene sequence of SARS-CoV2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with 90.1% and 39.2% respectively [17] . The S protein (S gene) is one of the most important structural proteins, which is used as a key that the virus uses to enter host cells. The spike protein attaches the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor and infects the host cell [18, 19] . In viral replication, the accessory proteins such as ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, SARS-COV2 genome shows 79.6% identity with SRS-COV1 genome [21] .
