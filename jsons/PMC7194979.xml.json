Through laboratory blood cell counts, lymphopenia was detected in 83.2% of the patients upon admission, the proportion of which was higher in those with severe illness than non-severe cases [6]. Meanwhile, 36.2% of patients had thrombocytopenia, and 33.7% of patients had leukopenia [6]. The reduction of white blood cells and platelets in the bloodstream may be a result of the over-mobilization and aggregation of immune cells in the lesion area for inflammation control. The occurrence of immune cells detachment from blood vessels increases the risk of excessive immune response and directly leads to cytokine storms [7]. When a large number of immune cells are concentrated in the lesion area, a great amount of cytokines are secreted through positive feedback stimulation between each other. Consequently, the immune cells will be activated excessively, which cause tissue damage in the lesion area, as well as severe immune overreaction in the body. This pathological process may directly leads to hypoxemia, shock, and multiple organs failure [8]. Therefore, reducing the excessive aggregation and response of immune cells is important for the prevention of cytokine storms and is beneficial for patient outcomes.",

Moreover, for controlling cytokine storms, only hormones and artificial liver blood purification systems are available at present[11]. However, the use of glucocorticoids cannot alleviate the progression of lung injury during COVID-19 infection, yet the side effects of glucocorticoids may significantly reduce life quality of patients [12,13]. Meanwhile, the application of artificial liver blood purification systems also faces challenges as this technology has not been widely used in clinical. Therefore, the successful treatment of COVID-19 patients, especially those severe cases with severe cytokine storms, were impeded.",

As of February 22, 2020, the rate of TCM treatment of COVID-19 in China was 87%, and the total effective rate of TCM treatment was 92%, of which only 5% of patients have worsened clinical manifestations [[14], [15], [16]]. Thus, the Chinese government decideded TCM as one of the recommended therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19 in the third version COVID-19 treatment guidelines, which was published on January 23, 2020 [17]. Besides, based on the theoretical system of TCM, physicians can combine and adjust prescriptions based on the symptoms of patients diagnosed. After nearly one month of clinical experimental observation, Qingfei Paidu Decoction, a formula consisting of 21 components including both herbs and mineral drugs, has been included in the 6th edition of the guidelines as the primarily recommended formulae [18]. According to the 6th and 7th edition of COVID-19 treatment guidelines [19,20], Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD) is effective for patients at all stages, and the total effective rate is 92.09% [21]. However, whether QFPD treat COVID-19 through regulating immune status and preventing cytokine storms has not been fully elucidated.",

At the same time, a disease network of patients based on their description of TCM symptoms was built via the SymMap database. Then, through network analysis, we analyzed the regulating pathways of QFOD and conducted biological verification via an in vitro macrophage activation model. Moreover, the chemical composition and pharmacological effects of a main component of Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction, was further verified by transcriptomics. In summary, our study demonstrated Qingfei Paidu Decoction regulates the level of cytokine storms during the infection, which may be key mechanism underlying its therapeutic effects in COVID-19. These results may also guide future researches on TCM in infectious diseases and hyperimmune-related diseases.",

The links among the herbs, compound categories, and compounds were shown in Fig. 5A. Then, we counted the number of targets corresponding to each drug based on the compound information contained in the herbal medicine (Fig. 5B). The results showed that MH, GC, CH, HQ, ZW were the herbs with the highest number of corresponding targets. After merging all the target information and removing the duplicate target content, we next performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis on the target information (Fig. 5C and D). As a result, in the GO enrichment analysis, QFPD played an interventional role by interfering with cellular processes, metabolic processes. The interventional effect was mainly on organelles and membrane structures, and the main targeted molecules were involved in protein binding process and the function of catalysis. KEGG analysis suggested that the effect of QFPD was mainly to interfere with viral infection-related pathways and cancer-related pathways. All the herb-compound-target information is in Supplementary Material 2.",

According to the diagnostic criteria in the 7th edition of COVID-19 treatment guidelines, TCM classified COVID-19 patients into four categories based on patients\u2019 pathological process, including mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Among them, the mild type included the syndrome of cold fluid-retention suspend in lung and the syndrome of stagnant and jamming dampness-heat in the lung; the moderate type was divided into the syndrome of dampness toxin and depression of lung and the syndrome of accumulation of cold fluid in the lung; the severe type contained the syndrome of dirty-toxicity blocking lung and the syndrome of flaring heat in qifen (also known as defense qi, a term describes qi is \u201cfierce, bold and uninhibited\u201d and unable to contained by the vessels and therefore flowing out side them ) and yingfen (also known as construction qi, which refer to the qi that forms the blood and flows with it in the vessels, helping to nourish the entire body) [39]; the critical type had only the syndrome of internal blockade and external collapse. We next collected the targets corresponding to the symptoms in the SymMap database according to the symptoms of different syndromes and the synonyms of the symptoms. The results showed that there were 773 duplicate target information in mild cases, of which the syndrome of cold fluid-retention suspend in lung contains 302 targets, whereas the syndrome of stagnant and jamming dampness-heat in lung contains 471 targets. For the moderate type, there were 413 targets for the syndrome of dampness toxin and depression of lung, and 420 targets for the syndrome of accumulation of cold fluid in the lung. For the severe type, 569 targets were collected for the syndrome of dirty-toxicity blocking lung, and 406 targets were collected for the syndrome of flaring heat in qifen and yingfen. Finally, for the critical type, 353 targets were included for the syndrome of the internal blockade and external collapse (Table 1\n).",

The results suggested that at different pathological stages (both class of mild, moderate, severe, and critical, or their divided categories), the targets that change during the pathological process are different. We then deduplicated, merged the target genes of the same class, and exhibited the results in the form of Venn diagrams (Fig. 6B). There are 233 targets in all four stages, and 376 targets appear in three stages, suggesting that in the pathological process of COVID-19, many biological processes may be shared (Supplementary Material 3). At the same time, in the transition phase, that is, mild phase to moderate phase, moderate phase to severe phase, severe phase to critical phase, the number of common targets appeared is relatively large, 77 between the mild and the moderate, 124 between the moderate and the severe, and between 82 the severe and the critical. To further find the regular of these targets, we merged, with no repetition, all the targets and then enriched these genes by GO and pathway (using the Reactome database) method. As a result, we found that targets were enriched in the regulation of a variety of biological processes and participated in the immune response process; the corresponding molecular functions of these genes were the docking, catalysis and molecular activity regulation of proteins; meanwhile, the positions of these targets correspond to subcellular organelles and cell membrane (Fig. 6C). This result was similar to the target network results of Qingfei Paidu Decoction, suggesting that Qingfei Paidu Decoction could be used as a promising formula to intervene in the pathological process of COVID-19. Moreover, we enriched the results of the biological process from GO and the results of pathways from Reactome database, and discover the immune regulation cells was the core physiological and pathological process of the pathological process of COVID-19 (Fig. 6D), which indicated that controlling the level of the immune response during the disease process was one of the crucial intervention to treating COVID-19.",

We also analyzed its chemical composition in parallel to the same LC-MS condition and investigated the synergistic effects on the content of main components, when different herbs were co-decocted and decocted individually (Fig. 8\nA). Based on the result of element analysis, it was found that the concentration of Manganese (Mn) and Nickel (Ni) arrived ppb level in the decoction after Gypsum fibrosum (SSG) was extracted for the first 30 min. It is interesting that the co-decoction of Herba Ephedrae (MH), Gypsum fibrosum (SSG), and Radix Glycyrrhizae (GC) lead to the increased yield rate of ephedrine (Fig. 8B).

These signaling pathways are closely related to the regulatory mechanism of the immune system (Supplementary Fig. S5). Vital proteins in these pathways, such as F12, F13b, F9, AT3, etc., were mainly concentrated in the blood coagulation system.

As a result, we found that Toll-like signaling pathway plays important roles in pharmacological mechanism of QFPD for treating COVID-19. Compound from QFPD may directly interfere with Toll-like receptor 4 and regulate the downstream signaling pathways, including the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of release of proinflammation factors, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8. These cytokines may further induce the inflammation storm in COVID-19 [41], which is one of the most critical signs of the severe and critical condition of COVID-19, and the leading cause of patients death. Interestingly, based on the results of network pharmacology, QFPD may also regulate the downstream positions except for the Toll-like receptor 4, like PI3K, AKT, and CASP8, without interfering Toll-like receptor 2/3. Similarly, Qingfei Paidu Decoction also affects the INF-\u03b1 response induced by viral DNA or RNA invasion.

            "text": "Meanwhile, glycyrrhizic acid, an indispensable compound in the whole recipe of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction, is a compound with a glucocorticoid-like effect [49]. Clinical data shown that glycyrrhizic acid has excellent anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and other suppressive immune response [50]. However, on the other hand, it may exerts side effects with potent cytotoxicity and bone damage characteristics [51]. This suggests that the therapeutic window of glycyrrhizic acid may be narrow. However, the co-decoction of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction lead to the controlled content of glycyrrhizic acid within a suitable dose range to exert anti-inflammatory effects without significant side effects. Due to limitation of time, whether glycyrrhizic acid and other major constituents of QFPD regulated other nodes and pathways in COVID-19 disease model are not fully investigated. Further research on the synergistic and additive effects of those compounds in QFPD will enhance our understanding on its pharmacological mechanism against COVID-19.",

By establishing a COVID-19 disease network and enriching the key nodes and pathways regulated by the active ingredients of QFPD, we found that Toll-like receptor signaling pathway play important role in pharmacological effects of QFPD. Interestingly, we found that Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction, the core component of whole recipe may have a major contribution to the overall efficacy of QFPD. Further results of chemical analysis suggested that the contents of ephedrine and glycyrrhizic acid changed after decoction. Transcriptomic analysis of effects of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction in a rat model of pneumonia suggested that it regulated the coagulation system in the inflammatory state, which benefits QFPD to intervene the inflammatory storm caused by COVID-19. Our research provides an experimental and computational basis and research ideas for further discovery of TCM formula and botanical drug for the treatment of COVID-19.",
