In addition, 10-\u03bcm-thick sections stained with Picric Sirius Red were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Glomerulosclerosis scores were assessed by A.M.H. and J.W.S. by assessing approximately 100 glomeruli in a PAS-stained renal cross-section. Each glomerulus was scored from 0 to 4 assessing a score of 0 or 1 depending on whether sclerosis was absent or present, respectively, in each glomerular quadrant. For electron microscopy, kidneys were fixed in buffered 1% glutaraldehyde-4% formaldehyde, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon-araldite. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a transmission electron microscope (1200 EX-II; Jeol, Peabody, MA).",

Samples were analyzed by capillary-column gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry as previously described.18 Blood pressure measurements were made in mice anesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen (1%/99%). The right common carotid was cannulated using a 1.4 French catheter (Millar Inc., Houston, TX), which was advanced into the proximal aorta for blood pressure measurements.

There was a fivefold increase in collagen I staining (Figure 4a) and a sixfold increase in collagen III staining (Figure 4b) in the glomeruli of ACE2 mutant mice. In addition, there was a threefold increase in glomerular staining for fibronectin (Figure 4c) and a threefold increase for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (Figure 4d) in ACE2\u2212/y mice compared with ACE2+/y mice. To exclude secondary causes of glomerular changes, we investigated whether these mice were diabetic or hypertensive.

In contrast to the cardiac phenotype,16 the kidneys showed markedly abnormal features (Figure 5). The cortices and medulla of these double mutant mice were thinned, and the renal calyces were cystically dilated with widespread interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates and abnormally appearing glomeruli with small and incomplete capillary loops within a loose extracellular matrix. These profound abnormalities precluded the use of this model to test whether the renal phenotype in ACE2 mutant mice was ANG II-dependent. Instead, we treated ACE2\u2212/y mice with the AT1 blocker (ARB) irbesartan for 10 months. The mean arterial blood pressure was 101.4 \u00b1 4.6 mmHg in the ACE2+/y mice, whereas mean arterial blood pressure values were lower in both the ACE2\u2212/y mice and ACE2\u2212/y mice treated with irbesartan (83.8 \u00b1 6.2 and 77.2 \u00b1 5.6 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.05 vs. the ACE2+/y mice). The 1-year-old ARB-treated ACE2\u2212/y mice showed no gross renal abnormalities and showed normal cortical, medullary, and vascular architecture (Figure 6, a\u2013c). Glomeruli in the treated mice appeared normal, comparable to 1-year-old placebo-treated ACE2+/y wild-type mice (Figure 6a) and markedly different from placebo-treated ACE2\u2212/y mice which showed diffuse glomerulosclerosis (Figure 6b). AT1 blockade prevented glomerulosclerosis, hyalinosis, capillary microaneurysms, mesangial expansion, or glomerular arteriolar hyalinosis (Figure 6c). The semiquantitative glomerulosclerosis score was normalized in the ARB-treated ACE2 mutant mice (Figure 6d), and there was complete resolution of the albuminuria (Figure 6e).",

Male ACE2 mutant mice showed significantly higher levels of aldehydes in their kidneys compared to age-matched wild-type controls (n = 6). These levels were normalized in the ARB-treated ACE2\u2212/y mice (n = 8) to levels comparable to wild-type control mice. The measures of lipid peroxidation products in the kidneys of female ACE2+/+ and ACE2\u2212/\u2212 mice were also comparable to wild-type control male mice (Figure 7, a\u2013c). Immunohistochemical staining for the mitogen-activated protein kinase, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, showed a normal distribution of phospho-ERK1/2-positive nuclei in the epithelial cells of distal tubules and collecting ducts (data not shown). However, glomeruli of ACE2\u2212/y mice showed a significantly higher number of phospho-ERK1/2-positive nuclei compared to wild-type mice, which was prevented by treatment with ARB (Figure 8a). The number of phospho-ERK1/2-positive nuclei in the glomeruli of female ACE2\u2212/\u2212 mice was similar to the wild-type male mice (Figure 8, a and b). Quantitative manual scoring of phospho-ERK1/2-positive nuclei per glomerulus confirmed these findings in all three groups (Figure 8b). Thus, loss of ACE2 in male mice leads to an ANG II-dependent increase in oxidative stress and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in the kidneys of male ACE2 mutant mice.",

For example, kidneys of 3-week-old angiotensinogen knockout mice (Agt\u2212/\u2212) had substantially smaller glomerular tufts, tubular dilatation, arterial wall thickening, atrophic papillae, hyperplasia of the interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles, interstitial fibrosis, renal lesions, and mesangial expansion.28 When human renin (R) and angiotensinogen (A) transgenes were inserted into Agt\u2212/\u2212 mice, R\u2212A\u2212Agt\u2212/\u2212 mice presented with the same kidney injury as Agt\u2212/\u2212 mice by 3 to 5 months, whereas R+A+Agt\u2212/\u2212 mice possessed a rescued phenotype, except for rare mild focal regions of fibrosis.29 Krege and coworkers30 reported that the kidneys were abnormal in ACE\u2212/\u2212 mice. Intrarenal arteries exhibited a marked hypercellularity and increased wall thickness, and these vascular abnormalities were associated with cortical atrophy and interstitial inflammation, changes similar to the findings in Agt\u2212/\u2212 mice.30 Mice lacking the AT1A receptor (Agtr1a\u2212/\u2212) and AT1B receptor (Agtr1b\u2212/\u2212) (ie, double nullizygotes (Agtr1a\u2212/\u2212 and Agtr1b\u2212/\u2212)) had multiple structural and functional renal abnormalities: atrophied papillae, severely thickened arterial walls, areas of cortical interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and medial hyperplasia of the interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles.31,32 Increasing copies of the ACE gene in 6-month-old mice were positively correlated with urinary albumin excretion but not with any structural injury.33 To determine the mechanism responsible for the development of glomerulosclerosis, we first studied double mutant (ACE\u2212/\u2212/ACE2\u2212/y) mice. We have previously reported that the postnatal cardiac phenotype is rescued in the double mutant (ACE\u2212/\u2212/ACE2\u2212/y) mice and appears similar to the ACE mutant mice.16 In the current study, we found that the kidneys of the ACE\u2212/\u2212/ACE2\u2212/y mice were markedly abnormal with findings that were similar to those described in ACE\u2212/\u2212 mice30,34 and angiotensinogen28 mutant mice.

Gender is an important determinant of kidney disease progression, but the one or more mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of female gender on kidney disease have not been fully elucidated.35 Our finding is consistent with the potent ability of estrogens to antagonize the pathological effects of ANG II in animal models36,37 and patients.35,38,39 The biological effect of estrogen on kidney has also been the focus of a number of investigations.37,40\u201342 The natural history of a number of experimental animal models of kidney disease is also influenced by gender or treatment with exogenous estrogen.37,42 Cellular mechanisms that may play a role in gender protection include inhibition of transforming growth factor-\u03b21-induced collagen gene expression40 and mechanical strain-induced mesangial cell signaling.41 Although we did not define the mechanism responsible for the protective effect of female gender in the current study, we did find that there was no increase in lipid peroxidation products in the kidneys of ACE2\u2212/\u2212 female compared to ACE2+/+ female mice. In this regard, Baumer and coworkers43 reported that treatment with a selective estrogen receptor modulator can reduce ANG II-induced oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells. Estrogen treatment also reduces oxidative stress in hepatic stellate cells due to suppression of NADPH oxidase activity.44 Accordingly, an estrogen-mediated effect on oxidative stress may be responsible for the gender effect that we observed, but further studies will be necessary to determine whether this is the case.",

Rats are much more sensitive to the effects of ANG II infusion than mice, and kidney injury is evident within 14 days.21 Moreover, ANG II type 1 receptor blocker prevented glomerular injury and development of glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria in ACE2 male mutant mice. ANG II activates NADPH oxidase in vascular smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells and the subsequent generation of ROS, such as superoxide (O2).23,47,48 ANG II and ROS play an important role in cellular signaling and the activation of gene expression, including genes of extracellular matrix proteins like collagens and fibronectin via transforming growth factor-\u03b2- and NF\u03baB-mediated gene expression.49\u201351 ANG II-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling molecule ERK1/2 is mediated, at least in part, by the trans-activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in a ROS-dependent manner.22 Accordingly, aldehydes, which are lipid peroxidation products and sensitive indicators of oxidative stress,18,52 were increased in the kidneys from ACE2 mutant mice consistent with an increase in the generation of ROS. Increased oxidative injury was associated with activation of glomerular ERK1/2 leading to accumulation of extracellular matrix in the glomerular capillary tuft. Increase in glomerular \u03b1-smooth muscle actin occurs in response to cellular injury to the glomeruli20 and can be recapitulated by infusion of ANG II.21 The critical role of ANG II in mediating these changes was confirmed by complete blockade of ROS formation, phospho-ERK1/2 nuclear staining and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin formation by treatment with the AT1 blocker irbesartan. Taken together, this data support the hypothesis that ANG II-induced generation of ROS is responsible for the glomerular injury in male ACE2 mutant mice.",

Similarly, we cannot discount the role of other ACE2 reaction products in the pathogenesis of renal injury. Increased circulating and kidney ANG II levels are evident by 3 months of age in ACE2 mutant mice,16 but by 3 months of age, the mice also exhibit contractile dysfunction. It is possible that the cardiac dysfunction was associated with systemic neurohumoral activation, including activation of the RAS. However, circulating ANG I levels in ACE2 mutant are not increased, suggesting a lack of secondary activation of the RAS.16 Interestingly, we did not observe glomerulosclerosis in female ACE2 mutant mice despite the fact that female mice developed contractile dysfunction,16 suggesting that the gender protection of the kidney occurred despite cardiac dysfunction and supporting, at least in part, a role for altered ANG peptide processing in the development of glomerulosclerosis in the male mice. In addition, normal plasma creatinine in the ACE2 mutant mice (see Table 2) indicates the absence of prerenal azotemia despite the development of glomerular injury.",

Renal ACE2 expression is decreased in hypertensive rat models.16 In experimental diabetes, Tikellis and coworkers17 have reported that ACE2 protein expression is localized mainly in kidney tubules and that the level of expression is decreased in the renal tubules of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (measured at 24 weeks). In contrast, Ye and co-workers53 found that ACE2 expression was increased in the renal tubules of 8-week-old db/db mice compared to control db/m mice, and the authors speculated that the increase was an early protective response. Lely and coworkers54 studied ACE2 immunostaining in renal biopsies from 58 patients with primary and secondary renal diseases (including IgA glomerulopathy, minimal change nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, focal glomerulosclerosis, and membranous glomerulopathy) and 18 normal renal biopsy samples. In normal kidneys, ACE2 was present in tubular cells, glomerular epithelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and the endothelial cells of interlobular arteries. All of the primary and secondary renal diseases were associated with the de novo expression of ACE2 in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelial cells, but further studies will be necessary to better define the possible protective role of ACE2 in human renal disease.",
