Overlapping DNA fragments covering the MHV-GFP genome and a TAR vector were transformed into yeast, upon which the DNA fragments assemble by homologous recombination, generating a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) comprising the full-length viral cDNA. Notably, >90% of screened clones showed correct assembly of the YAC, indicating high efficiency of assembly. Infectious virus was successfully recovered from two individual clones by isolating and linearizing the YACs for in vitro transcription to generate viral RNA, which was then transfected into the BHK-MHV-N hamster cell line, jointly with an mRNA encoding the MHV nucleocapsid protein, to produce and amplify the virus. Recovered virus exhibited the same replication kinetics as parental MHV-GFP.",

The approach was also applied to a mutated MERS-CoV clone, which had a GFP gene inserted. YAC clone assemblies and virus rescues from cloned DNA were successful, ascertaining the applicability of this platform to a broader range of viruses, including genetically modified virus genomes.",
