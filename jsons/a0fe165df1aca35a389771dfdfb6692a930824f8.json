Modern intensive care and a better understanding of this disease have led to signifi cant improvements in mortality. For example, sepsis associated mortality decreased from a majority of children in 1966 (i.e., close to 100 %) [ 2 ] to approximately 10 % among children in developed countries today [ 3 , 4 ] . Despite the tremendous advances made in the last few decades, the morbidity and mortality attributed to sepsis remain unacceptably high. Severe sepsis is still one of the leading causes of death in children with almost 4,500 deaths reported annually in the United States alone [ 5 ] . Worldwide, especially in developing countries, the toll of sepsis in terms of mortality and costs is probably much higher, although exact fi gures are lacking. However, if all of the pediatric deaths resulting from infectious diseases are considered in aggregate, sepsis is clearly the leading killer of children worldwide (see further discussion below) [ 4 , 6 ] .",

Between 2000 and 2005, the prevalence of severe sepsis increased again by 45 %. The increase in sepsis is likely due in part to the increasing life expectancy of technologydependent children and children with chronic medical conditions. Current estimates suggest that there are between 75,000 to 100,000 cases of severe sepsis in children in the United States every year, with an associated cost of $4.8 billion [ 10 , 15 ] . While the overall case fatality rate has decreased (from 1995 to 2000, the case fatality rate decreased from 10.7 to 8.9 %), because there are more children affected now, the absolute number of deaths from sepsis has increased [ 15 ] .",

In this group, neonates (i.e., infants less than 28 days of age) are particularly at risk for sepsis, with prematurity and low-birth weight being significant risk factors. Again, in the series reported by Watson and colleagues, low-(LBW) and very-low birth weight (VLBW) infants accounted for nearly one-fourth of all children with severe sepsis and approximately 70 % of all infants with severe sepsis in 1995 [ 5 ] . During infancy, chronic medical conditions -especially chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disorders, and malignanciesappear to be signifi cant risk factors. The increase in sepsis cases also refl ects the growing numbers of VLBW infants in the United States. The majority of infections causing severe sepsis in children are respiratory infections (accounting for about one third of all cases) and primary bacteremias (which account for approximately one quarter of all cases of sepsis in children). Bacteremia without an apparent focus appears to be more frequent in neonates and children with an underlying malignancy, whereas respiratory infections predominate in older children without underlying illness [ 5 , 13 , 14 ] .",

Some of these factors are single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes controlling the host response to microbes [ 23 -25 ] and commonly used therapeutic agents [ 26 ] . Identifi ed alterations include polymorphisms in TNF receptors, interleukin-1 receptors, Fc\u03b3-receptor, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Polymorphisms in cytokine genes may determine the concentrations of infl ammatory and anti-infl ammatory cytokines produced during sepsis and may infl uence whether persons have a marked hyper infl ammatory or hypo infl ammatory response to infection. Combinations of polymorphisms, or haplotypes, may ultimately be used to identify patients at high risk for the development of sepsis and organ dysfunction during infection and might dictate immune based therapy to modulate the response to a given patient.

With permission from Wolters Kluwer Health analyzed over a 1-year period, 82 % of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) met criteria for SIRS, while 23 % had sepsis, 4 % had severe sepsis, and 2 % had septic shock. The SIRS criteria also lack suffi cient sensitivity and specifi city outside the PICU environment, where early recognition and diagnosis are critically important. For many of these reasons, the \"PIRO\" concept [ 37 ] was proposed as a staging system for sepsis, modeled after the TNM ( T umor, N odes, M etastasis) system [ 38 ] for staging malignancies. The PIRO staging system stratifi es patients on the basis of their P redisposing conditions, the nature and extent of the insult ( I nfection), the nature and magnitude of the host R esponse, and the degree of concomitant O rgan dysfunction (Table 30 .4 ). The PIRO staging system has many favorable attributes, but will require thorough validation and testing before it is widely adopted and applied in clinical practice [ 39 -41 ] , particularly in pediatrics [ 42 , 43 ] . Importantly, although sepsis is defi ned as a systemic infl ammatory response to an inciting infection, an infectious microorganism is isolated in fewer than 50 % of cases [ 44 ] . A suspected infection, as shown by positive fi ndings at physical examination (e.g., signs of arthritis or osteomyelitis), petechial rash, or abnormalities on auscultation of the chest can therefore defi ne sepsis . Laboratory evidence of infection such as the presence of white blood cells in a normally sterile body fl uid or imaging techniques showing pulmonary infi ltrates can also validate the suspicion of an infection. It should also be noted that in the defi nition of septic shock , there is no requirement for systemic hypotension, because children are often able to maintain their blood pressure at the expense of peripheral perfusion, even if they are severely ill.",

For example, the number of dysfunctional organs is frequently used as a surrogate marker of disease severity in children with MODS, with the rational that the greater the number of dysfunctional organs the worse the outcome. This score is called the pediatric MODS score and has been used by several investigators [ 45 ] . The Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score has recently been validated as an outcome measure in children with MODS [ 46 ] . In addition, Graciano and colleagues recently developed and prospectively evaluated the Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (P-MODS) using a database of 6,456 consecutive admissions to the PICU at their tertiary care institution [ 47 ] . Finally, there are a number of diseasespecifi c scoring systems that have been proposed for use in children with meningococcemia and septic shock [ 48 -51 ] . Scoring systems such as these are important to link the severity of sepsis with measured outcome variables. Further information regarding these types of scores is provided in other chapters of this textbook. In addition, recent work by our group suggests that a pediatric sepsis biomarker risk profi le The host response is determined by the predisposing factors: the nature of the host response infl uences the chances of survival and signifi cant morbidity: diffuse intravascular coagulation, balance between of pro-and anti-infl ammatory cytokines This response is modifi ed by timely interventions of the physician, such as antibiotics and early goal directed therapy, determining the chance of the development of organ dysfunction O rgan dysfunction Variations in patterns of organ dysfunction like myocardial depression, ARDS, renal failure and liver failure affect outcome. They are the result of the complex interaction between microcirculatory dysregulation, energy depletion and apoptosis. The severity of organ dysfunction is the major determinant of the outcome of sepsis (PERSEVERE) reliably identifi es critically ill children at risk of death from septic shock. PERSEVERE, which is based upon fi ve biomarkers performs better than any of the currently used severity of illness scores [ 52 ] .",

Pediatricians need to be constantly aware of the possibility of infections and subsequent sepsis in children admitted to the PICU. A possible focus of infection should be elicited by careful history and physical examination. All the major organ systems of the body are adversely affected by inadequate oxygen delivery from perturbations in cardiac and respiratory function. In addition, these organ systems are also injured by the direct cytotoxic effects of bacterial toxins and circulating cytokines (see below). The onset of sepsis is often insidious and the initial signs and symptoms are therefore relatively non-specifi c and refl ect the body's attempt to compensate for poor oxygen delivery. Children often present with fever, tachypnea (refl ecting a compensatory mechanism aimed at counteracting the metabolic acidosis which occurs due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues), tachycardia (refl ecting a compensatory mechanism to increase cardiac output and oxygen delivery to the tissues), leukocytosis or leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and alterations in mental status. Fever is frequently the initial manifestation of infection and is believed to result from the release of a number of the cytokines elicited in response to infection, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. Children, especially infants, may also present with hypothermia, which appears to be associated with worse outcome in adults with sepsis [ 55 ] . The mental status of a child with sepsis is frequently altered, ranging from agitation to obtundation. This depressed mental status can be present even in the absence of meningitis and refl ects inadequate oxygen delivery to the central nervous system. The skin is frequently hypoperfused with decreased capillary refi ll and mottling. Petechiae and purpura are sometimes present and, while helpful in diagnosis, can be ominous signs. For example, petechiae classically points towards meningococcal sepsis, but can also be manifest in several other infections (e.g., Haemophilus infl uenzae , Streptococcus pneumonia , Staphylococcus aureus , enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella, etc.).",

Septic shock does not readily fall into any one of these four categories. Rather, septic shock is unique in that several of these forms may be present simultaneously in the same affected child. For example, a child with septic shock may exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with hypovolemic shock secondary to capillary leak, increased insensible losses, and decreased effective blood volume secondary to venodilation; cardiogenic shock secondary to the myocardial-depressant effects of bacterial toxins and infl ammatory cytokines; and distributive shock from decreased systemic vascular resistance. The degree to which any one child manifests these physiologic perturbations varies considerably. For example, Ceneviva et al. [ 57 ] categorized 50 children with fl uid-refractory septic shock based upon hemodynamic data obtained with the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter into one of three possible cardiovascular derangements -(i) a hyperdynamic state characterized by a high cardiac output (>5.5 L/min/m 2 BSA) and low systemic vascular resistance (<800 dyn sec/cm 5 ) (classically referred to as warm shock ); (ii) a hypodynamic state characterized by low cardiac output (<3.3 L/min/m 2 BSA) and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR); or (iii) a hypodynamic state characterized by low cardiac output and high SVR (>1,200 dyn sec-cm 5 ) (classically referred to as cold shock ). In stark contrast to adults in which the early stage of septic shock is most often (~90 %) characterized by a high cardiac output and low SVR ( warm shock ), most of the studied children (~60 % of cases) were in a hypodynamic state characterized by low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance ( cold shock ) and required the addition of inotropes and vasodilators to decrease SVR, increase CI, and improve peripheral perfusion [ 57 ] . Children with low cardiac output (as defi ned by a cardiac index less than 2.0 L/min/m 2 BSA) had the highest risk of mortality. These fi ndings have been confi rmed in multiple studies using a variety of methods to measure cardiac output and vascular resistance [ 58 -64 ] . Collectively, these studies all point to the fact that hypotension in children is a very late sign that portends a poor prognosis. Moreover, children more commonly present with cold shock, as opposed to warm shock.",

An immune response to eradicate any infectious challenge is appropriate and necessary to prevent evolution and spread of the pathogen throughout the host. However, in some cases the infl ammation is not limited and becomes generalized, resulting in the constellation of signs and symptoms of SIRS, as described above. SIRS may or may not be associated with infection. If the infection is not contained, the spread of the pathogen through the blood may result in systemic endothelium activation and precipitate severe sepsis and septic shock. Host immunity is grossly divided into innate and adaptive responses, but in reality there is a great deal of cross-talk between the two systems. Innate immunity is rapid, largely non-specifi c, and is composed of barriers, phagocytic cells, the complement system, and other soluble components of infl ammation. Following breech of a barrier, cellular elements of the innate immune response are the fi rst line of defense against the development and progression of infection. Adaptive immunity, which is antigen-specifi c, long-lived, and takes several days to develop, provides immunologic specifi city and memory.

The respiratory mucosa is defended by epithelial cells, cough, mucociliary clearance, resident professional phagocytes, and the secretion of a number of proteins and peptides with host defense functions. The collectins, surfactant protein A and D, possess valuable immune function by increasing opsonization of inhaled pathogens.

Pro-infl ammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-12, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and TNF-\u03b1 are produced early in the host response and activate innate immune effector cells [ 107 ] . Compared to septic adults, septic neonates produce less IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 [ 108 -113 ] . A wide variety of chemokines are increased during sepsis, including CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1a), and CXCL8 (IL-8) [ 114 ] . Other chemo-attractive molecules also increase with sepsis, including complement proteins C3a and C5a, antimicrobial proteins or peptides including cathelicidins and defensins, as well as components of invading bacteria themselves [ 107 , 115 ] . The importance of chemo-attractive substances in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis is highlighted by recent studies showing that CXCL8 can be used a stratifying factor for survival in children [ 116 ] , and C5a is implicated in sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in adults [ 75 ] . Chemokine investigations in septic neonates revealed that CXCL10 is a sensitive early marker of infection [ 114 ] , and low CCL5 levels may predict development of DIC [ 117 ] . Careful interplay between anti-and pro-infl ammatory stimuli serves to govern the immune response to allow local pathogen containment but prevent systemic activation leading to excessive infl ammatory damage though SIRS associated with multi-organ failure and death (Fig. 30.3 ) [ 118 ] . The previously accepted host-response to sepsis paradigm (an intense pro-infl ammatory response, or SIRS temporally [ 70 ] . With permission from Elsevier) followed by a compensatory anti-infl ammatory response syndrome [CARS]) has been challenged by the failure of multiple anti-infl ammatory strategies. New data demonstrate a simultaneous pro/anti-infl ammatory response where the magnitude may determine outcome [ 119 ] . Near simultaneous increases in anti-infl ammatory cytokine production (TGF-\u03b2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13) occur during infection countering the actions of pro-infl ammatory cytokines [ 107 , 120 , 121 ] . These mediators blunt the activation of phagocytic cells, block fever, modify coagulation factor expression, and decrease production of ROI/RNI, NO, and other vasoactive mediators [ 122 -126 ] .",

DCs are \"professional APCs\" and are depleted from the spleen and lymph nodes with sepsis in animal models and may be important for survival [ 176 ] . Monocytes and macrophages are closely related to PMNs (common myeloid progenitor) and can kill pathogens by similar means. Circulating monocytes differentiate into macrophages following exposure to maturing cytokines and exit the blood stream into tissues. Important substances produced by stimulated monocytes/macrophages that may contribute to sepsis and septic shock include complement components, cytokines (both pro and anti-infl ammatory), coagulation factors, and extracellular matrix proteins [ 177 ] .",

Expression of TLRs allows endothelium to become activated in the presence of microbial components, leading to production of cytokines and chemokine gradients, as well as adhesion molecules (VCAM, ICAM, L, P, and E-selectins, etc.). These substances all act in concert to attract circulating leukocytes and facilitate adherence [ 178 -182 ] . Vasoactive substances released from activated leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells include platelet-activating factor (PAF), thromboxane (TBX), leukotrienes (LTE), nitric oxide (NO), histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins (PGE) [ 183 , 184 ] . These substances are all necessary to attract immune cells (primarily PMNs) to the site of infection and to facilitate pathogen containment. Stimulated endothelium can be a double-edged sword, however, because excessive activation can lead to vascular dilation and leak which are a driving forces behind the severe consequences of septic shock [ 178 , 185 ] . Systemic overproduction of cytokines and vasoactive substances including NO are associated with circulatory alterations and organ failure. The balance of NO and endothelin-1 (ET-1), which is a vasoconstrictor, may be disrupted with endothelial damage, favoring the constrictive effects of ET-1 leading to ischemia and injury [ 186 ] . This phenomenon may explain in part why NO inhibitors increased mortality in adults with septic shock [ 187 ] . Glucocorticoid receptor is the target for the endogenous, adrenally produced steroid corticosterone. Endothelial GR is a critical negative regulator of NO synthase expression and NF-\u03baB activation [ 188 ] , demonstrating its role of endothelium in protecting the host during sepsis. Recent studies revealed a potential role of plasma angiopoietin protein during pediatric septic shock [ 189 ] . Angiopoietin-1 (protects against vascular leak) was reduced while angiopoietin-2 (promotes vascular permeability) was elevated highlighting a novel potential therapeutic opportunity to reduce end organ injury with pediatric septic shock. Activated or damaged endothelium establishes a prothrombotic environment that can result in local microvascular occlusion [ 154 ] or progress to DIC [ 190 ] . Endothelial cell apoptosis, detachment from the lamina, and alterations in vascular tone combine to promote capillary leak of proteins and fl uid leading to hypovolemia and shock [ 191 ] . Using transgenic mice, it was recently shown that pulmonary endothelial cells sense bloodborne bacteria and their products [ 178 ] while alveolar macrophages patrol the airspaces for pathogens [ 192 ] . These data illustrate the role of endothelium help to explain in part the occurrence of ARDS and PPHN associated with severe sepsis in the absence of a primary pulmonary infectious focus.",

As discussed above, septic shock is really a composite of hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and distributive shock. Distributive shock is related to endothelial NO production that leads to excessive vasodilation. Cardiogenic shock may be related to mitochondrial death (induced by RNI and ROI) with subsequent myocardial dysfunction. In addition, some of the mediators released by the innate immune system are likely myocardial depressant factors [ 193 ] . Hypovolemia (absolute or relative) is very common. Peripheral vasoregulation abnormalities and myocardial dysfunction may play a larger role in hemodynamic derangements in pediatric patients, especially infants and neonates. Factors contributing to developmental differences in hemodynamic responses include altered structure and function of cardiomyocytes, limited ability to increase stroke volume and contractility, and contributions of the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation [ 65 , 194 -197 ] . In adults, septic shock is most commonly characterized by reduced systemic vascular resistance and elevated cardiac index [ 198 ] . In children, as discussed above, reduced cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance is more common [ 57 -64 ] . The hemodynamic presentation in neonates is much more variable [ 199 ] and complicated by an unclear association between a normal blood pressure and adequate systemic blood fl ow [ 200 , 201 ] . Myocardial dysfunction can lead to ventricular wall stretch that in turn elevates brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP levels have utility as prognostic indicators of mortality [ 202 ] in older patients with sepsis and in post-operative children [ 203 ] .",

The role of vagal tone in the pediatric host response to sepsis is unclear. Discovery and characterization of the impact of epigenetic-mediated immune system functional alterations following sepsis is an area of intense research. DNA methylation as well as posttranslational modifi cation of histone proteins (methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation) may occur after sepsis [ 195 , 223 ] .

Unfortunately, early recognition and diagnosis of sepsis, especially in children, remains a signifi cant challenge, even in developed countries with advanced health care delivery systems [ 4 , 256 , 264 ] . Failure to recognize the signs and symptoms of sepsis and to institute timely and appropriate care leads to higher mortality rates in children and adults [ 54 , 265 -271 ] . There are no simple, straightforward blood tests that can reliably diagnose patients with sepsis. While early evidence suggests that the biomarker procalcitonin is more sensitive than C-reactive protein (CRP) in detecting serious bacterial illness in children with fever [ 272 ] , additional studies are required. The currently available test for procalcitonin is relatively inexpensive and readily available. Interleukin (IL)-27 may also be a more accurate biomarker compared to CRP, especially when used in conjunction with procalcitonin -though again further studies are required [ 273 , 274 ] . Until these biomarkers are studied more extensively, sepsis will remain primarily a clinical diagnosis based upon the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms (i.e., SIRS) that occur with infection.",

Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of early source control (which may include surgical removal of the nidus of infection) and antibiotic administration. For example, Gaieski and colleagues showed that mortality signifi cantly increased when antibiotics were delayed beyond 1 h in critically ill adults presenting to the ED with severe sepsis and septic shock [ 280 ] . A study by Kumar and colleagues showed that only 50 % of patients received antibiotics within 6 h of documented hypotension, which was associated with increased risk for mortality [ 267 ] . A protocolized approach to the management of sepsis has been shown to improve the time to administration of antibiotics in several studies involving both children [ 281 -283 ] and adults presenting to the ED [ 284 -289 ] . Indeed, this kind of approach has even been successful in resource-poor countries. For example, studies conducted in a rural population in India showed that home administration of oral and injectable antibiotics to neonates with perinatal-acquired sepsis resulted in signifi cant reductions in sepsis-related neonatal mortality -sustained over a 10-year period [ 290 , 291 ] .",

All patients had arterial and central venous catheters placed in the ED, and therapy was protocolized to achieve a CVP 8-12 mmHg with fl uid resuscitation, MAP >65 mmHg and <95 mmHg with vasoactive agents, and a superior vena caval oxygen saturation (S svc O 2 ) greater than 70 % with inotropes and blood transfusion. Importantly, treatment in the conventional therapy group was targeted towards a CVP 8-12 mmHg, MAP >65 mmHg and <95 mmHg, and urine output >5 mL/kg/h. In-hospital mortality was signifi cantly lower in the EGDT group compared to the conventional therapy group (30.5 % vs. 46.5 %, respectively, p = 0.009).

In addition, there are currently three prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trials going on in the United Kingdom, U.S., and Australia that are further testing the overall validity of this concept in critically ill adults with severe sepsis/septic shock. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign conducted a multicenter, international, prospective, collaborative involving over 15,000 patients worldwide. Increasing compliance with a 6-h resuscitation bundle (focused on early antibiotics and rapid reversal of shock) and maintenance bundle (focused more on lung-protective ventilation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, glucose control, corticosteroids for vasopressor-refractory shock, activated protein C) was associated with signifi cant reductions in mortality at participating hospitals [ 296 ] . There has since been signifi cant controversy regarding both the use of activated Protein C and \"tight glucose control\" in critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. A similar quasi-experimental study in Spain showed that compliance with the resuscitation bundle was more important than the maintenance bundle [ 301 ] .",

Many of these children have had poor oral intake of fl uid for a period of time prior to developing sepsis. With the development of increased vascular permeability, intravascular volume has been lost due to third spacing. Finally, peripheral vasodilation related to excessive NO production (see above) results in an abnormally increased vascular capacitance, decreasing the effective circulating volume. Aggressive fl uid resuscitation with crystalloids or colloids is therefore essential to increase survival of septic shock in children. This goal can be reached by administering 20 mL/kg boluses over 5-10 min, repeated as necessary to achieve the hemodynamic goals stated in the preceding paragraph [ 305 , 306 ] . Large fl uid defi cits are typically encountered, requiring 60 mL/kg volume resuscitation or occasionally much higher amounts [ 305 ] . Transfusion of packed red blood cells should be considered to maintain hemoglobin levels at levels consistent with adequate oxygen delivery, though the optimal hemoglobin for infants and children with septic shock is not currently known.",

In recent years, several studies have shown a correlation between fl uid overload and increased mortality in critically ill children requiring renal replacement therapy [ 316 -319 ] . Fluid overload has also been shown to correlate with impaired oxygenation, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and increased PICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), even in critically ill children who do not require renal replacement therapy [ 320 ] . Preliminary data from our group suggests that fl uid overload is associated with worse outcomes in critically ill children with a low initial probability of mortality, but not in children with an intermediate-risk or high-risk of mortality ( Wong, personal communication ) .",

In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, children presenting to the hospital (in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania) with a severe febrile illness received one of three treatments: 20-40 mL/kg 5 % albumin, 20-40 mL/kg 0.9 % saline, or no fl uid bolus. There were no differences in mortality at 48 h between the saline (110/1,047 children, 10.5 %) and albumin (111/1,050 children, 10.6 %) groups, though mortality was lowest (76/1,044 children, 7.3 %) in the control group that did not receive a fl uid bolus. These results were consistent across all sub-group analyses [ 321 ] . A follow-up analysis of these results showed that excess mortality occurred as a result of cardiovascular collapse and not fl uid overload (pulmonary edema, neurologic deterioration, etc.) [ 322 ] . Given the accumulation of several decades of experience with intravenous fl uid resuscitation, it would seem premature to abandon (or even temper) this therapy without additional data. In addition, it should be noted that the FEAST study and the majority of the aforementioned studies comparing crystalloid to colloid in children were performed in patient populations (e.g., dengue fever, severe malaria, severe malnutrition, etc.) that are quite different from the majority of critically ill children with shock in the developed world. Whether these fi ndings can be generalized to different populations around the world remains an area of active study. In light of the remaining questions and available data, the usual practice in most PICUs is to initiate volume resuscitation with crystalloid fl uids as a fi rst line and follow with colloid if needed.",

In the case of fl uid refractory shock, inotropic or vasoactive support should be started without delay. Again, the most common hemodynamic derangements observed in critically ill children with septic shock are low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance (i.e., socalled cold shock ). Dopamine has traditionally been the initial agent of choice for infants and children with septic shock [ 306 ] , though the choice of additional agents will be determined by the clinical condition of the child. For example, dobutamine or epinephrine may be preferable in children with low cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion ( cold shock ), especially given the association of dopamine with increased morbidity and mortality in several studies [ 323 ] . In addition, there have been some observational studies in both critically ill children and adults suggesting that dopamine may be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [ 324 -326 ] . Norepinephrine is the preferred agent for children with normal cardiac output and bounding peripheral pulses ( warm shock ). A type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as milrinone may also improve perfusion in children with cold shock , who are adequately volume resuscitated, though hypotension is always a risk with this agent. Regardless of the vasoactive regimen chosen, close monitoring of the oxygen delivery, as assessed by end-organ function, mixed venous oxygen saturation and a falling lactate levels, is necessary to tailor ongoing treatment. Finally, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) may be necessary and lifesaving in select patients [ 327 -332 ] .",

Because of increased metabolic rate and poor nutrition, septic patients are frequently catabolic and at risk for the development of protein calorie malnutrition [ 333 ] . Intestinal ischemia in association with the loss of the mucosal barrier from malnutrition has been associated with translocation of bacteria and endotoxin from the intestine into the blood stream [ 334 , 335 ] . Use of enteral feeding in critical illness has been shown to improve survival and decrease hospital stay [ 336 ] . The benefi t of enteral feeding should be balanced with the risk of stressing the intestinal function in the face of poor splanchnic perfusion, especially in the presence of vasopressors such as epinephrine and norepinephrine [ 337 , 338 ] . Regardless of the mode of feeding, adequate nutrition and nitrogen balance is important for maintaining adequate host immune function and achieving homeostasis. Malnutrition may adversely affect the immune function and the ability to have an appropriate immune response [ 339 ] .

However, most of the studies suggested that high-dose corticosteroids did not improve survival in septic patients and may even have worsened outcome by increasing the incidence of secondary infection [ 340 ] . However, more recent data suggests that patients, who are critically ill, in persistent shock, requiring vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, might benefi t from physiological doses of corticosteroids [ 341 ] . This fi nding has not been confi rmed in other studies [ 342 ] . Some investigators have postulated that some patients with sepsis may have a relative adrenal insufficiency despite normal serum cortisol levels, because of desensitization of corticosteroid responsiveness [ 343 , 344 ] . This has been shown in critically ill children with meningococcal sepsis [ 345 ] and in other forms of sepsis [ 343 ] . Unfortunately, there have been no randomized, controlled studies of corticosteroid replacement in critically ill children with severe sepsis or septic shock. The most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [ 300 ] recommend corticosteroids only if the patient remains refractory to vasoactive medications. In addition, use of the ACTH stimulation test to discern between relative and absolute adrenal insuffi ciency is not necessary. The pediatric version of these guidelines suggests starting stress-dose hydrocortisone (50-100 mg/m 2 /day hydrocortisone) in critically ill children with fl uid-refractory and catecholamine-resistant septic shock and suspected or proven absolute adrenal insuffi ciency (i.e., after appropriate diagnostic workup with a random/basal serum cortisol level followed by an ACTH stimulation test). The diagnosis and treatment of adrenal insuffi ciency is discussed in great detail in other chapters of this textbook.",

Pathogen-stimulated tissue/blood monocytes, dendritic cells ( DC ), and macrophages release proinfl ammatory cytokines that activate the surrounding endothelium. Endothelial activation results in upregulation of cell adhesion molecules ( CAM ), production of chemokines and vasoactive substances, activation of complement, and development of a procoagulant state. Recruitment of PMNs occurs along the chemokine gradient surrounding the area of infl ammation. Anti-infl ammatory cytokines counter the actions of proinfl ammatory cytokines to prevent excessive cellular activation and recruitment that can result in tissue damage and systemic infl ammation.
