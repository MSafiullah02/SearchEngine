Nevertheless, the largest numbers of natural products reported since the early days of marine natural product research in the 1960s until today originate from marine invertebrates, with sponges being clearly at the top [2]. More than 5,300 different natural products are known from sponges, and more than 200 additional new metabolites from sponges are reported each year [3]. It is widely accepted today that the rich chemical diversity of sponges provides an effective chemical defense to these sedentary and soft-bodied organisms against environmental threats such as predation, overgrowth by fouling organisms, or microbial infections [4].",

On the other hand, evidence is mounting that not all sponge-derived natural products are necessarily biosynthesized by sponges but may rather trace back to bacteria and other microorganisms that either reside within sponges or are inhaled by filter feeding [6, 7]. Examples of metabolites originally isolated from sponges that are in fact biosynthetic products of microorganisms include okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor obtained from Halichondria sponges [8] that was shown later to be produced by dinoflagellates of the genus Prorocentrum [9]. Other examples include manzamine A and its 8-hydroxy derivative, antimalarial compounds first obtained from marine sponge of the genus Haliclona, that were isolated from a Micromonospora strain from the sponge Acanthostrongylophora sp. [7]. For many other compounds originally reported from sponges, a microbial origin is likewise suspected even though clear evidence apart from obvious structural analogies with known microbial compounds is still lacking.",

In vitro analysis of several manzamine analogues against Toxoplasma gondii indicated significant activity. Manzamine A (1) displayed 70% inhibition of the parasite at 0.1 \u03bcM concentrations without displaying host cell toxicity. The activity significantly increased at concentrations of 1 and 10 \u03bcM even though it was accompanied by an increase in host-cell toxicity. As a result, manzamine A was selected for in vivo analysis. A daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of 8 mg/kg of manzamine A, given for 8 consecutive days, beginning on day 1 following the infection, prolonged the survival of SW mice to 20 days, as compared to 16 days for untreated controls [35].

Their deterrent activity against predators is of ecological significance as shown for Caribbean reef sponges of the genus Agelas [39, 40]. Bromopyrrole alkaloids are also of interest due to their pronounced pharmacological activities including cytotoxicity, antimicrobial, and immunosuppressive activities which have driven the research interest of natural product chemists toward their total syntheses primarily during the last decade. These synthetic efforts lead to successful total syntheses of many bromopyrrole alkaloids such as dimeric pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids including sceptrin, oxysceptrin, and ageliferin [41]; nagelamides D [42] and E [41]; and hymenialdisine analogues [72].\n",

For example, in a feeding assay, hymenidin exhibited lower deterrence against fishes as compared to oroidin [46]. N-methylation of pyrrole moiety in sventrin (20) likewise reduced fish feeding deterrency [45]. The reduction of voltage-dependent calcium elevation in PC12 cells was found to be directly proportional to the number of bromine atoms associated with the pyrrole ring in oroidin and hymenidin [47].

On the contrary, all dispacamides exhibited a remarkable antihistaminic activity on the guinea pig ileum through a reversible noncompetitive binding to histamine receptors, with dispacamide A (21) being the most active derivative [48]. Dispacamide C (23) and D (24) showed only mild activity in comparison which indicated the importance of the hydroxyl group in the side chain and also implicated that its orientation resulted in a notable reduction of antihistaminic activity [49].

Dibromoagelospongin (38) is closely related to dibromophakellin (39) (Scheme 4.2) in which N7 is bonded to C11 instead. The latter was first isolated in 1971 by Sharma et al. [77]. Later, several other phakellins have been reported from Pseudaxynissa cantharella [68] and Agelas sp. [78]. In 1997, a further derivative, phakellistatin, which differs from 39 in having a urea-type carbonyl instead of amino group present in the guanidine moiety, was isolated from the Indian Ocean sponge Phakellia mauritiana [79]. Phakellistatin exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines (IC50 values from 0.3 to 0.4 \u03bcM) [79].",

The same study reported in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis as demonstrated in the CAM (chick chorioallantoic membrane) assay and matrigel plug assay. Aeroplysinin-1 exhibited preferential cytotoxicity against L5178Y cells compared to murine spleen lymphocytes through reducing the incorporation rates of 3 H-thymidine [119]. In vivo experiments by the same group revealed an antileukemic activity of 100 in L5178Y cell/NMRI mouse system. In conclusion, aeroplysinin-1 proved to be an inhibitor of both angiogenesis and tumor proliferation.",

Aeroplysinin-1 inhibited tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR in vitro and blocked ligand-induced endocytosis of the EGF receptor and PDGF receptor in vitro [129].

It furthermore inhibits DNA synthesis and DNA gyrase [140], farnesyl protein transferase and leucine aminopeptidase [137], chitinase B from Serratia mercescens [136], in vitro replication of SV40 DNA through \u03b1\u2013primase targeting [138], activation of peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor gamma [141], and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in cell-based assays, the latter having been highlighted as one of the key enzymes involved in both oncogenesis and angiogenesis, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [143\u2013145]. PsA also inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in vitro [142]. However, the lack of in vivo inhibition of DNA methylation suggests that this enzyme is not a major cellular target. Furthermore, it inhibited aminopeptidase N (APN), a Zn-dependent metalloproteinase that has been implicated in tumor invasion and angiogenesis [139]. Both homodimers and heterodimers were further assayed for antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and structure refinement of promising lead compounds through parallel synthesis afforded a series of antibacterial agents significantly more active than the natural product [140, 146].",

[156]. Psammaplysene A (120) compensated for the loss of PTEN tumor suppressor by relocating the transcription factor FOXO1a to the nucleus (IC50 = 5 \u03bcM) compared to psammaplysene B (121) (IC50 = 20 \u03bcM) [155]. The growth-inhibiting PTEN phosphatase proved important for regulation of the growth-promoting PI3-kinase signal. Hence, loss of functional mutations in PTEN can result in an inappropriate increase in stimulatory signals, and such mutations have been linked with Cowden\u2019s disease, a hereditary disease with a predisposition to breast, thyroid, and other cancers [155]. Both psammaplysene C (122) and D (123) showed cytotoxicity (IC50 = 7 \u03bcM). Hence, their bioactivity in both P2X7 and hemolysin specificity assays was attributed to cytotoxicity against the premonocytic cell line THP-1, which expresses the P2X7 receptor [156]. In 2005, Georgiades and Clardy synthesized 120 and 121 by a flexible efficient route using 4-iodophenol as a common starting substrate [157]. \n",

            "text": "Antithrombotics (= anticoagulants) are crucial therapeutic agents for a number of thrombotic disorders such as myocardial infarction, angina, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular incidences. The conventional antithrombotic therapy is performed by intravenous administration of heparin followed by oral treatment with warfarin. Besides being indirect and nonspecific inhibitors of coagulation serine proteases, both heparin and warfarin require very careful and costly monitoring to ensure safe therapeutic drug levels over treatment duration due to the high risk of bleeding. Therefore, enormous efforts focused on new plausible drug candidates with an improved efficacy-to-safety index compared to heparin and warfarin. Factor XIa (FXIa) is a trypsin-like serine protease that plays a major role in the amplification phase of the coagulation cascade and in maintaining clot integrity. FXIa is a unique target as its specific inhibitors might inhibit thrombosis without intimate interruption of normal hemostasis and thus might prevent or minimize the risks of hemostatic complications. In an attempt to achieve this target, Buchanan et al. isolated a series of bromotyrosine-derived alkaloids from two different collections of the Australian Verongid sponge Suberea clavata, trivially named as clavatadine A\u2013E (128\u2013132) [159, 160]. All clavatadines were tested for their inhibitory activities against factor Xia. Only clavatadines A (128) and B (129) inhibited selectively FXIa with IC50 values of 1.3 and 27 \u03bcM, respectively [159], while other clavatadines showed only weak inhibitory activity (17\u201337%) against FXIa at concentrations up to 222 \u03bcM [160]. The crystal structure and molecular docking of 128 enabled understanding of SARs. Conclusively, they revealed that clavatadine A (128) can approach/bind in the S1\u2013S1\u2019 pocket of FXIa by favorable interactions with Asp189 at its guanidine group on one end and the free carboxylate to either Arg37D or Lys192 of the other. This would result in a close contact between the side chain of Ser195 and the carbamate group of 128, which eventually leads to the covalent binding with FXIa. Clavatadine B (129) is more than one order of magnitude less potent than 128, presumably due to weaker interactions between its amide group and either Arg37D or Lys192, compared to the carboxylate moiety in 128 [159].\n",

Although L-tyrosinyltyramine proved to be completely inactive even at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, the oxime-bearing debromohemibastadin inhibited barnacle settlement at almost similar concentrations as the brominated derivatives thus corroborating the importance of the oxime function [171].",

Structural study of discodermin E revealed the presence of a D-kynurenine residue replacing a D-Trp residue and a reversed sequence of the 12th and 13th residues from the N-terminus compared to discodermin A (142) [191].

In addition, discodermins F\u2013H (146\u2013148) were cytotoxic against P388 murine leukemia cells with IC50 values of 0.6, 0.23, and 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively [192]. Discobahamins A and B exhibited weak antifungal activity against Candida albicans [193]. Polydiscamide A inhibited the proliferation of human lung cancer A549 cell line (IC50 = 0.4 \u03bcM) in vitro and the growth of Bacillus subtilis (MIC of 1.8 \u03bcM) [194]. Interestingly, polydiscamides B\u2013D acted as pain modulators by activating the sensory neuron-specific G protein coupled receptors (SNSRs), which are expressed solely in dorsal root ganglia [198]. Previous studies showed that SNSRs are key players in both acute and persistent pain [199]. Due to the highly restricted distribution of SNSRs in the body, ligands that interact with these receptors may potentially modulate pain with very few side effects [195]. Polydiscamides B\u2013D showed potent agonist activity against human SNSR with EC50 values of 1.26, 3.57, and 2.80 \u03bcM [195], and they were the first examples of nonendogenous compounds with human SNSR agonist activity. Therefore, they could potentially be modified for therapeutic use as pain modulators.",

Therefore, the \u03b2-tyrosine residue appeared to be the only strict common feature essential for biological activity in the tested tumor cell lines, mainly assuring a \u03b2-turn motif for the folding of the entire molecule [210]. Moreover, the modifications of the abrine residue, claimed as essential for the observed biological activity [212], appeared to have little influence on the observed antiproliferative effect with the exception of jaspamide N (153), where the \u03b2-hydroxylation of tryptophan unit causes a diminution of the biological activity. As suggested by Maier [213], the 1,3 methyl groups of the polypropionate subunit, imposing to the macrocycle conformational constraints through syn pentane interactions, play a significant role in assuring a correct folding of the entire molecule as suggested by the drop of activity for jaspamides F (151) and H (152).",

In 1996, an X-ray crystal structure analysis of the hemiasterlin methyl ester confirmed its linear structure and unusual amino acids existence [221]. All hemiasterlins (157\u2013160) exhibited pronounced in vitro cytotoxicity against a variety of human and murine cell lines with IC50 values in the nanomolar range [215]. The potent antiproliferative activity of hemiasterlins was found to be due to the induction of mitotic arrest in metaphase with cellular dynamics similar to those of known tubulin binders, such as the chemotherapeutics paclitaxel or vinblastine, at ED50 values ranged from 0.5 nM (hemiasterlin) to 28 nM (hemiasterlin B) [222].\n",

Other structural elements, including the geminal \u03b2,\u03b2-dimethyl group and the N-methyl on the first amino acid residue (N terminus), the isopropyl and an olefin in the homologated \u03b3-amino acid (C terminus) including a terminal carboxylic acid or methyl ester, were essential for activity. The aryl side chain on the N terminus could be replaced synthetically by alkyl groups (e.g., tert-butyl) while still retaining potent activity [223\u2013226]. Preclinical studies showed that HTI-286 causes tumor regression and growth inhibition of human xenografts in mice [227]. An open-label phase I clinical trial of HTI-286 was completed in patients with advanced solid tumors; however, there were no objective responses and common toxicities observed including neutropenia, nausea, alopecia and pain [228]. Therefore, phase II trials have been halted. Nevertheless, there is still interest in HTI-286 according to recent results including high antitumor activity in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mouse models of refractory prostate cancer and in a newly established in vitro taxane-resistant prostate PC-3 cell line [229].",

Dysinosin A (163) was isolated from a new genus of sponges found near Lizard Island (Australia) [233]. Afterward, it was reisolated together with the other three dysinosins B\u2013D from the Australian marine sponge Lamellodysidea chlorea [234]. Dysinosins are structurally related to the cyanobacterial metabolites aeruginosins [235\u2013237]. Aeruginosin 98-A (162) was reported in 1994 as a thrombin and trypsin inhibitor from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa [235]. Not surprisingly, dysinosins A\u2013D also exhibited inhibitory activity against thrombin (IC50 values of 0.17\u2013 > 5.1 \u03bcM) and factor VIIa (IC50 values of 0.09\u20131.32 \u03bcM) [233, 234]. Dysinosins A\u2013D (163\u2013166) were further investigated to assess their SARs. The X-ray structural analysis of dysinosin A (163) revealed a hydrogen bonding network forming the dysinosin-A-thrombin complex [233]. The introduction of a sugar unit at C-13 in dysinosin B (164) gave a slight increase in inhibition of factor VIIa compared to both dysinosins A (163) and C (165) (0.09 \u03bcM compared to 0.108 and 0.124 \u03bcM, respectively), while selectivity relative to thrombin decreased to 1.9 compared to 4.2 and 4.4, respectively [234]. Desulfated dysinosin D (166) was found to be ten times less potent against both factor VIIa and thrombin compared to other sulfated dysinosins, indicating the importance of the sulfate group [234].\n",

In contrast to other peptides, stylisins 1 and 2 proved inactive in antimicrobial, antimalarial, anticancer, anti-HIV-1, anti-Mtb, and anti-inflammatory assays [260].

Kapakahine B (175) was the first reported congener, and it exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against P388 cells (IC50 = 5.9 \u03bcM) [185]. All other kapakahine derivatives exhibited moderate to weak cytotoxic activity [186, 187]. Their structures, however, were found to be unique and of biogenetic interest.",

They were isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei (Japan) [270] together with two additional congeners C and D [271], whereas cyclotheonamide E was isolated from a morphologically different specimen of Theonella swinhoei [271]. Chemical investigation of the marine sponge Theonella sp. collected off Tanegashima Island led to the isolation of cyclotheonamides E2 and E3 [272], while cyclotheonamides E4 and E5 were obtained from the Okinawan marine sponge Ircinia sp. [273]. Cyclotheonamides (A\u2013E) and (E2\u2013E5) were found to possess potent inhibitory activity against serine proteases including thrombin, trypsin, and plasmin [270\u2013273]. Their mode of action was elucidated by X-ray crystallography of the complex between cyclotheonamide A (178) and human \u03b1-thrombin which disclosed that (1) the binding of 178 to the catalytic triad of the enzyme is achieved through forming a network of hydrogen bonds between the \u03b1-keto group of the K-Arg residue and the hydroxyl group of Ser195 of the enzyme, (2) V-Tyr residue proved to be involved in the bonding mechanism, and (3) cyclotheonamide D which possesses D-Leu instead of D-Phe in 178 showed comparable activity against thrombin; thus, a further hydrophobic amino acid can replace D-Phe [271].\n",

These results were substantiated to the more favorable (1) aromatic interaction of the D-Phe in 178 with Tyr39 and Phe41 in trypsin than with Glu39 and Leu41 in thrombin and (2) interaction of N-formyl Dpr residue with Gly174 and Gln175 in trypsin than Ile174 and Arg175 in thrombin [272].

Pseudotheonamide D, a tetrapeptide lacking a C-terminal K-Arg unit and dihydrocyclotheonamide A, is a reduction product of cyclotheonamide A (178). Peptides 180\u2013183 and dihydrocyclotheonamide A inhibited thrombin with IC50 values of 1.0, 3.0, 1.3, 0.19, 1.4, and 0.33 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas they inhibited trypsin with IC50 values of 4.5, >10, 6.2, 3.8, >10, and 6.7 \u03bcM, respectively [274]. As revealed by a SAR study of cyclotheonamides, potent inhibition of serine proteases is associated with the presence of the \u03b1-keto group of K-Arg residue [270\u2013273]. Therefore, it was not surprising that pseudotheonamides, in which the \u03b1-keto group was either modified or missing, showed only moderate activity [274]. Thus, cyclotheonamides and pseudotheonamides inhibited serine proteases including trypsin and thrombin. These results suggested that cyclotheonamides and pseudotheonamides may be useful for treatment of asthma and other disorders associated with inflammation of the respiratory tract in addition to coagulatory disorders [273].\n",

Interestingly, mirabamide B was consistently found to be less potent than other mirabamides (187\u2013189) in both neutralization and fusion assays.

This indicates that Tyr residues bearing substitutions at the 4\u2019 position can be tolerated with no deleterious effect on antiviral activity and that the presence of a free 4\u2019 hydroxyl on the Tyr unit is not essential [286]. In summary, the reported results disclosed that mirabamide A (187) is equipotent to papuamide A (185) (which also contains a \u03b2-OMe Tyr residue), whereas theopapuamide A (190), which was isolated from a Papua New Guinea lithistid sponge Theonella swinhoei and lacks a \u03b2-OMe Tyr residue, was inactive [287]. One hypothesis that would be consistent with these results is that the \u03b2-OMe Tyr residue imparts a specific conformation required for binding to target protein(s) involved in HIV-1 entry [286]. However, neither 4-chlorohomoproline nor \u03b2-methoxytyrosine 4\u2019-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside that are present in mirabamides affected their anti-HIV activities [286].",

According to the TSA structure, a plausible binding mode to the enzyme is by inserting the long aliphatic chain of TSA into the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme. Then, the terminal hydroxymic group coordinates with a zinc ion at the polar bottom of the pocket while the aromatic dimethylaminophenyl portion of TSA makes contact with the pocket entrance and an adjacent surface group thereby capping the pocket. Trapoxin A [319] and apicidin [320] are the parent congeners of two classes of HDAC inhibitory cyclic tetrapeptides containing groups that may be analogous to the aliphatic side chain of TSA. Trapoxins possess a 2-amino-8-oxo-9,10-epoxy-decanoic acid, in which the epoxide moiety is thought to bind irreversibly to the enzyme [317], while the apicidins comprise a 2-amino-8-oxo-decanoic acid, with the keto group being responsible for zinc chelation [321].",

            "text": "Manoalide was further investigated and found to be a potent inhibitor of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) [351\u2013358]. Subsequently, many structurally related metabolites with PLA2 inhibitory activity were also reported [328, 359\u2013365]. PLA2 is an enzyme that specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the S\nN\n-2 position to produce a lysophospholipid and arachidonic acid, which in turn provides the substrate for proinflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes, collectively known as the eicosanoids [361]. Since manoalide revealed an irreversible inhibition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) [353], the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of this compound attracted scientific interests to study and to understand both PLA2 function and mechanism of action in the whole cell. Therefore, several studies were successfully performed to determine the contributions of the various functional groups incorporated in 223 and its analogues, such as the \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide, \u03b1-hydroxydihydropyran, and trimethylcyclohexenyl ring systems, to the efficacy as PLA2 inhibitors [356, 361, 365]. These studies indicated that (1) the existence of the hemiacetal in the \u03b1-hydroxydihydropyran ring is crucial for irreversible binding, (2) the \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide ring is involved in the initial interaction with PLA2, and (3) the hydrophobic nature of the trimethylcyclohexenyl ring system allows nonbonded interactions with the enzyme that enhances the potency of these analogues. These studies suggested that the closed ring form of manoalide is the predominant molecular moiety that accounts for the selective and potent inhibition of PLA2 [356].",

This meant that 227 became a more preferable anti-inflammatory agent for potential pharmacological investigation [328]. In addition to luffariellolide (227), its 25-O-methyl (228) and 25-O-ethyl derivatives (229), five related sesterterpenes, acantholides (A\u2013E), were obtained from the Indonesian sponge Acanthodendrilla sp. [349]. Acantholide D (230) and E (231) represent rare variants for the C14\u2013C20 segment in this type of linear sesterterpenes in which they have the 1-acetylcyclopentan-5-ol moiety replacing the trimethylcyclohexenyl ring. Luffariellolide (227) and its 25-O-methyl congener (228), as well as acantholide E (231), were cytotoxic against the mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell line with IC50 values of 8.5, 1.8, and 16.8 \u03bcM, respectively. Interestingly, these results suggest that the 25-O-methyl group in 228 and the stereochemistry of 1-acetylcyclopentan-5-ol in 231 play an important role [349]. Luffariolides (A\u2013J) represent a related group of sesterterpenoidal analogues, which have been obtained from different collections of the Okinawan marine sponge Luffariella sp. [333, 334, 336].",

Despite this discrepancy in chemical structure, luffariellins A (236) and B (237) retain identical functional groups as present in manoalide (223) and secomanoalide (224), respectively. Therefore, not surprisingly, each respective pair was shown to have similar anti-inflammatory properties to 223 and 224 [327]. Luffarin metabolites comprise another group of compounds represented by 28 derivatives. Twenty-six of them, luffarins (A\u2013Z), have been reported from the Australian marine sponge Luffariella geometrica [332], while the other two were obtained from the Adriatic Sea sponge Fasciospongia cavernosa [348]. Based on the chemical structures, luffarins have been classified into 14 bicyclic sesterterpenes, luffarins (A\u2013N); one bicyclic bisnorsesterterpene, luffarin O; one monocyclic sesterterpene, luffarin P; and six acyclic sesterterpenes, luffarin (Q\u2013V), in addition to four diterpenoidal derivatives, luffarin (W\u2013Z) [332]. All luffarins were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus sp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Only luffarins C\u2013F (244\u2013247), K (248), and L (249) showed activity against both S. aureus and Micrococcus sp. [332], whereas luffarins A (242) and M (250) revealed only mild activity against the latter. Moreover, some luffarins were also found to be effective inhibitors of nicotinic receptors [332]. \n",

Two main groups of PLA2 enzymes have been reported [382], the secretory PLA2 (sPLA2 groups I, II, III, V, IX, and X with relatively small molecular weights) and the cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2 groups IV, VI, VII, and VIII with higher molecular weights).

Petrosaspongiolide M (268) also inhibited bee venom PLA2 enzyme with IC50 of 0.6 \u03bcM, compared to 223 (IC50 of 7.5 \u03bcM) [380]. The mechanism of action of petrosaspongiolides M\u2013R (268\u2013272) as anti-inflammatory marine metabolites has been the topic for many research articles [383\u2013388]. The covalent binding of 268 to bee venom PLA2 has been investigated by mass spectrometry and molecular modeling. The mass increment observed was consistent with the formation of a Schiff base by reaction of a PLA2 amino group with the hemiacetal function at the C-25 atom of the petrosaspongiolide M \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide ring [383]. The molecular mechanism of inactivating the bee venom and the human type IIA secretory PLA2s by petrosaspongiolides R (272) [387] and M (268) [388], respectively, has been investigated. In both cases, either covalent (imine formation) and/or noncovalent (van der Waals) interactions contributed to the inhibitory activity against PLA2 enzymes [387, 388]. Due to potent anti-inflammatory properties of petrosaspongiolides, their chemical synthesis has been investigated. Recently, the first enantioselective synthesis of petrosaspongiolide R (272) has been successfully performed [389].",

            "text": "The malabaricanes are structurally characterized by a tricyclic triterpenoid core and a conjugated polyene side chain [390\u2013392], whereas the isomalabaricane skeleton is embedded in a 4,4,8,10-tetramethyl-perhydrobenz[e]indene with a trans-syn-trans ring junction, that leads to an unfavorable twist-boat conformation for the central ring [393, 394]. Isomalabaricane triterpenes were first reported from a Fijian collection of the sponge Jaspis stellifera [393] and the Somalian marine sponge Stelletta sp. [394]. Since then, they have been isolated from several genera of marine sponges belonging to the order Astrophorida including members of the genera Rhabdastrella [395, 400, 402, 406, 413, 414, 416, 420], Stelletta [397\u2013399, 405, 408, 412], Jaspis [401, 407, 409, 418, 419, 421, 422], and Geodia [403, 410, 415]. Isomalabaricane triterpenoids having polyene conjugated functionality can be classified into three groups: (1) stelletins principally possessing the \u03b3-pyrone functionality, which could be ring-opened in some of its congeners yielding the side chain with terminal free carboxylic acid and methyl moieties, (2) stelliferins oxygenated at C-22, and (3) globostellatic acids whose main feature is a carboxyl group at C-4. In addition to triterpenoids, the isomalabaricane core has also been recognized in some sesqui- and/or sesterterpenes. The isomalabaricane terpenoids were sometimes trivially named according to their sponge origin. Upon light exposure, the isomalabaricane-type terpenes readily isomerize at the C-13 position. Therefore, during isolation and characterization processes, they rapidly equilibrate into a 1:1 mixture of the 13E and 13Z isomers [398\u2013400, 408, 409, 418, 419]. Nevertheless, these compounds continue to gain a great deal of attention because of their significant cytotoxic activity [399, 409], whereas the nature of the natural isomer, either 13E or 13Z or both, is still unresolved. Recently it was reported that the 1H NMR spectrum of a crude extract obtained from the fresh sponge Rhabdastrella aff. distinca (Hainan, the South China Sea) revealed that it mostly contained isomalabaricanes with the 13E-configuration (H-15 of most derivatives appeared around 7.0 ppm). Thus, the 13Z isomers were suggested in this case to be formed through isomerization during the isolation and analytical procedures [406].",

Four of the rhabdastrellins (286\u2013289) exhibited a primary alcohol moiety at C-29 instead of a methyl group as for the stelletins and the other two rhabdastrellins E (290) and F (291). All rhabdastrellins and stelletins L and M share a hydroxyl group at C-3 instead of a carbonyl group as in other stelletins [406]. The antiproliferative profile of stelletins A\u2013F (278\u2013283) has been examined at the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Australia) against 60 cell lines. Due to the rapid isomerization upon light exposure, stelletins were tested as isomeric pairs. Stelletin C(280)/D(281) pair was the most potent derivative with a mean panel GI50 of 0.09 \u03bcM. The stelletin E(282)/F(283) pair was approximately ten times less potent (mean GI50 of 0.98 \u03bcM) [399]. Apoptotic cell death is a stress response of cells to cytotoxic agents that might be executed either through a receptor-mediated pathway that activates caspase-8 or through a receptor-independent pathway that involves the cyclin-kinase inhibitors p53/p21. Both pathways lead to a translocation of proapoptotic Bax protein to the mitochondria, thereby resulting in a dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-3, and execution of the apoptotic machinery [404].\n",

Eryloside E (341), glycosylated at C-30 through an ester linkage with the rare t-butyl substitution of the side chain, was isolated from an Atlantic sponge Erylus goffrilleri [429]. It revealed immunosuppressive activity with an EC50 of 1.8 \u03bcM and a therapeutic index (TI) of 9.5, which indicated that the immunosuppressive effect is specific and is not due to a general cytotoxic effect [429].\n",

Erylosides A (340) and K (345) led to a 50% mortality rate in the brine shrimp assay at a concentration of 0.14 mM. Eryloside L (346) was inactive at the same concentration [432]. In addition to erylosides, the marine sponges E. formosus and E. nobilis produced other steroidal saponins identified as formosides A (347) [435] and B (348) [436] and nobiloside (349) [437], respectively, whilst sokodosides A (350) and B (351) have been obtained from the marine sponge Erylus placenta [438]. A convergent synthesis of the trisaccharides of 351 has been successfully performed [439]. Formoside A (347) was first reported by Jaspars and Crews in 1994 from the Caribbean marine sponge Erylus formosus [435]. Later, it was isolated together with formoside B (348) from another collection of the same sponge from the Bahamas [436]. Formoside A (347) and its N-acetyl galactosamine derivative, formoside B (348) possess deterrent properties against predatory fish. Therefore, they were suggested to have important ecological functions, resembling those ascribed to similar compounds present in sea stars, sea cucumbers, and terrestrial plants [436].",

Then, from the same sponge collected in the Solomon Islands, four additional sarasinosides (D\u2013G) were reported [443]. From each of the marine sponges Melophlus isis (Guam) [444] and M. sarassinorum (Indonesia) [445], four sarasinoside congeners were isolated. Among the sarasinoside congeners known to date, sarasinoside A1 (352) and B1 (353) exhibited piscicidal activity against Poecilia reticulata with LD50 values (48 h) of 0.3 and 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively [440, 442].

However, in most cases, the biomass currently generated is still far from that required should a marine-based drug finally enter the pharmaceutical market [456]. Furthermore, the cultivation of invertebrates in their natural environment is subject to several hazards and threats, such as destruction by storms or diseases. An intriguing strategy has been to identify the true producers of bioactive compounds and to explore whether or not they are of microbial origin including bacteria, cyanobacteria, or fungi that are known to thrive within the tissues of marine invertebrates.",

Currently, only 5% or less of the symbiotic bacteria present in marine specimens can be cultivated under standard conditions [457]. Consequently, molecular approaches offer particularly promising alternatives through the transfer of biosynthetic gene clusters to a vector suitable for large-scale fermentation, thereby avoiding the obstacles in culturing symbiotic bacteria. Oceans will play a potential role in the future to control and relieve the global disease burden. In spite of the substantial development that has been achieved in disclosing novel drug leads from marine resources, more efforts are still required for more chemical entities to reach to clinical applications.",
