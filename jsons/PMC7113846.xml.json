As a major global health problem, this virus causes 114 million diarrhea episodes, 2.4 million hospitalizations, and an estimated 215,000 deaths worldwide annually (Grimwood and Buttery, 2007; Tate et al., 2016). Although rotavirus infection mainly occurs in developing countries, it also results in over 200 deaths and more than 87,000 hospital admissions in infants in European Union (Vesikari et al., 2007). Besides young children, organ transplantation patients are also susceptible to rotavirus infection irrespective of their age, causing long-term diarrhea and even death due to graft failure (Yin et al., 2015b). Although two global licensed rotavirus vaccines have been launched, no specific antiviral treatment is available.",

It is also used as treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and for autoimmune diseases (Bourgine et al., 2011). In particular, 6-TG is often used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (de Boer et al., 2006). IBD including Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and indeterminate colitis (IC) represent a heavy burden in Western countries (Kolho et al., 2012). Although the causes of exacerbations of IBD remain poorly characterized, gastrointestinal infections including rotavirus might induce flares in IBD (Masclee et al., 2013). Thus, preventing or treating rotavirus infection in these patients is of importance.",

            "text": "Upon ingestion, 6-TG is first metabolized into 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (6-TGMP), and subsequently into 6-thioguanosine diphosphate (6-TGDP), and finally into 6-thioguanosine triphosphate (6-TGTP) (Chouchana et al., 2012). Among these metabolites, 6-TGDP and 6-TGTP are able to compete with endogenous guanosine phosphates for Rac1 binding and to form 6-TGNP\u2022Rac1 complexes. These complexes are in turn incapable to support the formation of the active configuration of Rac1, a process that Rac1 interacts with GTP. Thus, 6-TG indirectly provokes inhibition of Rac1-dependent signaling (Shin et al., 2016), which has substantial consequences for cellular physiology. As a member of the Ras superfamily of Rho GTPases, GTP-bound Rac1 mediates a myriad of cellular processes including actin reorganization and gene transcription. Intriguingly, IBD is characterized by hyperactivation of Rac1 in the phagocyte compartment. This is associated with reduced effector function of Rac1, which is sensitive to 6-TG treatment (Parikh et al., 2014). The inhibition of Rac1 resulting from 6-TG treatment restores innate immune functionality of phagocytes in IBD patients, contributing to disease remission (Parikh et al., 2014). Thus, Rac1 hyperactivation appears an important immunosuppressive effector in human pathophysiology, at least in the phagocyte compartment.",

This resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus RNA replication (Fig. 1\nA, n = 3\u201317, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001). The IC50 value of 6-TG against SA11 rotavirus was 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221213 M, which is substantially below the concentrations reached in patients undergoing 6-TG or azathioprine therapy. CC50 of 6-TG to Caco2 cells was 9.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 M and selectivity index (SI, CC50/IC50) was 3.3 \u00d7 107 (Table S2). This was further confirmed at the infectious virus production levels and protein levels of the rotavirus VP4 protein (Fig. 1B and C). To further verify the effect of 6-TG on rotavirus replication, SA11 rotavirus-infected Caco2 cells were treated with 6-TG at different time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 h), demonstrating that 6-TG significantly inhibited rotavirus RNA replication in time-dependent Manner (Fig. 1D, n = 4\u20138, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). These results were substantiated by experiments in human primary intestinal organoids, a model system that recapitulates many aspects of the intestinal epithelium, including the presence of a villus domain and a crypt domain (Fig. 1E) (Sato and Clevers, 2013). 6-TG significantly inhibited SA11 rotavirus replication and virus production in these organoids (Fig. 1F and G, n = 6, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Our results were essentially repeated using five patient-derived rotavirus isolates in Caco2 cells but also in human intestinal organoids (Table S3).

After 20 passages, the effects of 6-TG (100 ng/mL) on each representative passage (both drug treated and untreated) of rotavirus was quantified by qRT-PCR. Our results indicate that rotavirus remains sensitive to 6-TG treatment in MA104 cells (Fig. 2\nA) and Caco2 cells (Fig. 2B).

Thus, we investigated the potential role of Rac1 on rotavirus replication. To this end, we performed a lentiviral RNAi-mediated loss-of-function assay to silence the Rac1 gene. Two (no. 9689 and 9691) out of five RNAi vectors showed potent knockdown of the target gene (Fig. 3\nA). Importantly, these two RNAi vectors resulted in 65.0 \u00b1 0.1% (n = 10, P < 0.001) and 61.8 \u00b1 0.2% (n = 6, P < 0.05) reduction of SA11 rotavirus viral RNA, respectively (Fig. 3B). In apparent agreement, we obtained Rac1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells (MEFs), and their status as a bona fide knockout was confirmed by western blot assay (Fig. 3C). Rotavirus replication in Rac1 knockout MEFs (\u2212/\u2212) was significantly less efficient (62.4 \u00b1 0.2%; n = 4; P < 0.05), compared with the replication in wild type MEF (lf/lf) (Fig. 3D). Thus, decreased Rac1 levels correlate with increased resistance towards rotavirus replication.",

This was done by transfection of the active Rac1V12 plasmid or the dominant negative Rac1N17 plasmid. Expression of both plasmids was successful when tested by flow cytometry (Fig. 4F). Accordingly, Rac1V12-transfected cells displayed abundant GTP-Rac1, which in contrast is low in Rac1N17-transfected cells, as determined in a Rac pull-down assay (Fig. 4G). These results were confirmed by analyzing abundance of phospho-PAK2 status (Fig. 4H). Importantly, Rac1V12 promoted, but Rac1N17 inhibited rotavirus replication (Fig. 4I). Taken together, activation of Rac1 supports rotavirus replication.",

As a major player of the Rho family of small GTPases, Rac1 plays a vital role in various cellular signaling pathways to regulate a wide variety of cell functions including gene transcription, cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and redox signaling (D'Ambrosi et al., 2014). The expression of Rac1 is ubiquitous, but it has two conformational states including an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form (Bosco et al., 2009). It exerts biological functions mainly through activation of Rac1 (i.e. GTP-bound form) (Bosco et al., 2009). Many viruses interfere with or employ the conformational states of Rac1 to regulate their infection. At early stages of African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection, Rac1 is activated, and inhibition of Rac1 is able to suppress production of this virus (Quetglas et al., 2012). Rac1 is found to be activated during intracellular mature virus (MV) of Vaccinia virus entry (Mercer and Helenius, 2008).",
