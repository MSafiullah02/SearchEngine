I was personally well acquainted with the fourth to sixth Chairs, having learned the science of epidemiology from Abraham Lilienfeld, worked closely with faculty on research and teaching in the Department for decades under the direction of Leon Gordis, and then served as Deputy Chair under Jonathan Samet from 2005 to 2008. Each Chair served within the context of the day, whether it was the diseases affecting the population (e.g., the influenza pandemic), the new tools that became available (real-time polymerase chain reaction, whole genome sequencing), or opportunities that arose for new collaborations. Chairs can lead, delegate, find consensus, or even follow their faculty. Each of the Chairs of the Department has left their mark on the Department in different ways. In this review, I highlight what I consider to be the major contributions of each Chair to the Department and to the discipline (see Figure 1).\n",

            "text": "\nWilliam Henry Welch (1850\u20131934), the inaugural Dean of the School, was born in Connecticut on April 8, 1850 (1). Welch studied medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Welch next studied bacteriology in Germany and became one of the premier scientists in that field in the United States. He was recruited to Johns Hopkins in 1885, where he served as Chair of the Department of Pathology. He later was named Dean of the School of Medicine and then interim President of the University. Welch was the guiding force behind the establishment of the School along the lines of the German model of \u201cinstitutes of hygiene.\u201d His focus on an \u201cinstitute\u201d suggested the primacy of research over teaching; similarly, he preferred the term \u201chygiene\u201d over \u201cpublic health.\u201d This approach married the disciplines of public health with fundamental basic scientific research underlying these disciplines. On June 12, 1916, the Rockefeller Foundation awarded $267,000 to the Johns Hopkins University to establish the School of Hygiene and Public Health, the first such institution in the United States. This somewhat gangly name was a compromise between those advocating a School of Public Health aligned with the English model and an \u201cinstitute of hygiene\u201d based on the German model (1). The inaugural class consisted of 8 students, admitted in October 1918. Welch, along with his colleague W. H. Howell, founded the American Journal of Hygiene in 1920, which was renamed the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1965 and remains in publication to this day (volume 183 is currently in press), produced by the Department of Epidemiology in conjunction with Oxford University Press.",

After talking over his options on how he might best assist the development of the public health field with Rupert Blue, Surgeon General of the USPHS, Frost was assigned to Baltimore \u201con loan\u201d to the Johns Hopkins University. Frost served as the inaugural chair of epidemiology, appointed as Senior Lecturer in the fall of 1919 and then Professor in 1921.

His plan of instruction in \u201cthe natural history of infectious diseases\u201d included 20\u201330 lectures outlining principles and field methods, replete with examples, student group laboratory exercises based on manipulating real data using statistical methods linked to epidemiologic principles, a focus on student fieldwork in real-life conditions, critical reviews of the literature, and a thesis project to be conducted by the student under the direction of a faculty member (2). This vision of doctoral education in the discipline of epidemiology emerged from Frost's experiences of practicing epidemiology while in the USPHS. While the breadth of lectures has grown in number today and the methods greatly expanded, Frost's approach to epidemiology education should be very recognizable to today's faculty and students.",

The first center for student field placements was the Washington County Training Center in Hagerstown, Maryland, a rural county located approximately 70 miles (112 km) from the School. The Washington County Health Demonstration was founded in 1921 jointly between the School, the Maryland State Health Department, the USPHS, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Security Cement and Lime Company of Hagerstown. Access for students was difficult, however, due to the distance and the lack of transportation between Baltimore and Hagerstown. As a result, most students attended for only a week's time. This was grossly insufficient for learning how to apply epidemiologic methods in the field. Alternatively, the urban training site, the Eastern Health District, located just blocks from the School, which was financially supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the USPHS, was geographically positioned to ensure participation by students and eminently successful in providing field training opportunities. While the distance to Hagerstown from Baltimore is now less of a problem, transportation issues continue to hamper our students' ability to take full advantage of this training site.",

His work established that polio transmission occurred person-to-person rather than via any suggested vectors (most notably water). One of his gargantuan efforts was editing the fifth edition of Rosenau's Preventive Medicine and Hygiene in 1949 (7); this was the premier textbook in public health and the source of most contemporary epidemiologic methods. Upon his retirement (in 1954) he became Professor Emeritus, a position he held until his death from Parkinson's disease in 1966.

With the advent of the Asian flu epidemic of 1957, he investigated vaccine effectiveness and concluded that the vaccine was partially effective. In 1958, predating the Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco and Health (released in 1964), he wrote to the Baltimore Sun about the dangers of tobacco smoking with regard to health. In the mid-1960s, to great national attention, he pointed out the association between combined oral contraceptive use and vascular problems in women.

Sartwell is perhaps best known for his seminal 1950 paper entitled, \u201cThe distribution of incubation periods of infectious disease,\u201d published in the American Journal of Hygiene (10). He demonstrated that the incubation periods of many infectious diseases show a consistent pattern, using 3 types of observations: known single simultaneous-exposure epidemics; known but not simultaneous-exposure epidemics; and unknown outbreaks in which the epidemiologic curve might suggest simultaneous exposure. He originated the use of logarithmic plots of the incubation period and defined the \u201cestimated median,\u201d and he showed that the frequency curve of incubation times took the form of a lognormal curve (11). These observations underlie contemporary knowledge of epidemic theory. We now understand that epidemic curves and incubation periods are quite systematic, whether for infectious diseases or chronic diseases. Sartwell's insights demonstrated a continuing fascination with disease dynamics that have their origins in Frost's and Maxcy's work some 30 years before, and which remain in vogue in contemporary infectious disease modeling efforts.",

His 1976 text, Foundations of Epidemiology (13), published by Oxford University Press, was used for decades in many introductory epidemiology courses and was the first comprehensive treatise on the conceptual framework and methods of epidemiology. He was the author of 6 additional textbooks on research methods, cancer epidemiology, developmental disability, and genetic issues in public health. His scientific publications (14), numbering 155 peer-reviewed publications in a foreshortened career, covered the interpretation of screening tests, cerebral palsy and other congenital malformations, epilepsy and maternal risk factors, cancer (breast, cervical, urinary bladder, lung, skin, stomach), and cardiovascular diseases, among others. The range of his interests and his focus on the development of methods for incorporating epidemiologic investigations into causal thinking and drawing inferences about how risk factors lead to unequal distributions of disease in populations were hallmarks of his contributions to the discipline.",
