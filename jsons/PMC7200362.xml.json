In the US, we have experienced the impact on access to care, quality, and the way care itself is delivered. Even legal doctrines and privacy rules have been bypassed to provide care in a totally different environment. The provision of psychiatric care has changed depending on the setting the psychiatric physician is working. To help physicians understand the many changes in delivery of care, the American Psychiatric Association has issued national COVID-19 practice guidance, summarized in Table 1\n(APA Website, 2020).",

No visitor policies and suspension of group activities (Starace and Ferrara, 2020) have been utilized in some, but not all inpatient units.

Healthcare systems nationwide and world-wide as well, are leveraging telehealth to provide continued access to care to patients (Myers et al., 2020). This has required adjustment in programming, such as learning how to utilize webcam-based services. For patients without smartphone or computer access, telephone-based encounters have become a standard of care. Faculty and residents alike have transitioned to completing the majority of outpatient care while working from home, and supervision of trainees has also been transitioned to virtual modalities. Such transitions have been largely welcomed but also challenging at times, especially when the required technology is slow to connect, malfunctions, there is a security breach and loss of confidentiality, or when providers are not familiar with certain technologies. There also are challenges for patients who are unable to access technology such as smartphones or do not have access to high speed internet. Furthermore, while many patients seem to have adapted to virtual visits and may even benefit from certain aspects, such as elimination of transportation barriers, some patients have communicated that they prefer in-person appointments.",

These patients are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic for two salient reasons. First, many substances such as tobacco or marijuana create a compromised pulmonary system, increasing susceptibility to more serious consequences of coronavirus infection. Second, patients with SUDs are more likely to be in a lower socioeconomic status, leading to poor access to care. Therefore, it is paramount to consider both the guideline changes regarding SUDs as well as the actual impact patients are facing. Many associations such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) have issued guidelines, as early as March 16, 2020. Specifically, methadone clinics are loosening restrictions and allowing methadone to be prescribed in higher quantities, and Suboxone can now be prescribed via telephone without an in-person visit (APA Website, 2020). Controlled substances can also be e-prescribed directly to pharmacies. Many patients are reluctant to go into clinics to receive naltrexone injections for alcohol and/or opioid use disorder and are asking to be converted to oral naltrexone pills.",

Many older adults are fearful of contracting the disease given the vulnerabilities unique of this demographic group. A significant portion of elderly patients are quarantined in their homes, resulting in social isolation and loneliness, which can fuel anxiety and depression. Connecting with these individuals is essential to provide treatment for acute psychiatric concerns as well as continued treatment of chronic illness. However, elderly patients may be less likely to use technology and may have greater difficulty adapting to telepsychiatry. Finding creative means to delivering care such as incorporating assistance from family members and caregivers may be especially important for this vulnerable population.",

The care of patients seeking or referred for emergent psychiatric evaluation has also been impacted by the present pandemic. Many facilities have implemented screening protocols asking the same questions (Table 2\n) to triage patients for risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus and to assess level of symptoms. These protocols have evolved throughout the course of the pandemic. Initially patients deemed to be at elevated risk of exposure or demonstrating symptoms of COVID-19 were referred for supplemental medical evaluation, and in appropriate cases, testing. Now, in most healthcare systems, patients referred for inpatient psychiatric admission receive rapid COVID-19 testing prior to being evaluated by the psychiatrist and then in addition can be admitted to an appropriate unit. Some patients have expressed fear of contracting coronavirus by being in an emergency room setting, adding to their sense of suffering. To reduce risks to patients and staff alike, many consults and evaluations can be conducted using telephone visits. The physician can sit outside of the room, maintaining physical distancing, and complete an interview. They also can wait for potential cases to evaluate outside of the emergency room setting. Staff also are encouraged to physically distance from the patients. To mitigate risk of infection among staff, some hospitals are transitioning to a shift work model.

Admittedly, implementing prevention measures in such units can be a challenge, especially when part of treatment traditionally includes close contact, for example frequent safety monitoring, group therapy sessions, and eating meals together. Furthermore, there are logistical factors to consider, such as shared bathrooms and sleeping rooms. Elements to contingency planning include (Li 2020): a) disease precautions (screening, re-screening, personal protective equipment, use of designated clothing, cleaning of surfaces, and disinfection); b) restriction of visitors and minimization of non-essential contacts (e.g. medical students (Moszkowicz et al., 2020)); c) physician workforce considerations (creating back-up pools, job reassignment); d) operational adjustments (creating isolation rooms in psychiatry inpatient units, tightening criteria for psychiatric admission); and e) group therapy changes (limiting number of participants, utilizing physical distancing). As reported elsewhere and from experience, it is crucially important to have organized leadership, clear communication, and involvement of all disciplines in decision making (Li 2020).",

Infection Control subsections have been at the forefront with respect to collaboration, design and planning for the COVID-19 units. One challenge in providing this level of care is the difficult-to-predict course of a patient's infection. While patients admitted to this unit are discussed with internal medicine colleagues and determined to be medically stable on admission, some patients develop complications and require transfer to a medical unit. This is especially important to consider in psychiatric facilities where access to emergent interventions, such as intubation, is limited and patients must be brought by ambulance to the nearest medical facility.",

The current inpatient environment in some hospitals can preclude this treatment to balance the risks of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the combination of less face to face interaction, decreased in-person programming, restricted dining to in-room meals instead of communal dining and the \u201cno visitors policy\u201d is likely contributing to a decrease in the effectiveness of a therapeutic milieu on the psychiatric ward.

These responses can stem from either events happening in one's own life (e.g., a family member being diagnosed with COVID-19, or fear of losing a loved one), one's work environment (new protocols to follow, ever-changing and unclear guidance on personal protective equipment), or the interplay of both (being exposed to a patient with COVID-19 at work, and then having to quarantine and isolate oneself from family for 14 days). In general, the need for psychiatric treatment by psychiatrists is increasing, and they are finding work hours becoming longer, and much needed vacation time being cancelled by their places of employment in some instances. Certain phenomena are also becoming more evident as staff compare their roles to that of others on the team or in the healthcare system. For example, some nurses or physicians whose duties require them to be physically present in the hospital engender resentment toward those who work remotely.

This would include any information pertinent to a patient's medical decision-making process. If patients are, in fact, at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 due to psychiatric hospitalization, disclosing such information would seem critical. In addition, many psychiatric patients are admitted on 72-hour emergency commitments. This takes on new ethical meaning in the midst of the pandemic. To our knowledge, there is no literature discussing how hospitals are addressing this issue. We similarly found no evidence that patients are being informed that psychiatric hospitalization may increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19, or that patients are being included in the decision to bear that risk. As more psychiatric patients contract the virus, addressing these issues may be increasingly urgent and ethically necessary.

The virtualization of patient care using video conferencing platforms is one example of this dilemma. Virtual encounters support the principle of nonmaleficence by reducing risk of viral transmission while still enabling the provision of care, and therefore beneficence. However, these principles are achieved at the expense of patient privacy, as video conferencing platforms have variably robust security that does not meet the privacy standards set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). For psychiatrists, compromising patient privacy is particularly precarious given the uniquely sensitive nature of mental health information, from both a personal and legal standpoint. Fortunately, this question was addressed by Federal policy, which specifically allowed for the use of such platforms despite potential risks to patient privacy (Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). The weight of this ethical dilemma, at least, did not fall on individual providers. When policymakers cannot keep pace with the pandemic and fail to address ethical dilemmas as quickly as they are encountered, are individual physicians forced to face these challenges alone? Perhaps this is the most significant ethical burden facing physicians, and particularly psychiatrists, in the age of COVID-19: being asked to answer complex ethical questions in real-time; questions that even experienced policymakers have not yet answered.",

How Do We Manage Communication? How Do We Maintain Community? How Do We Create a Sense of \u2018Normalcy?\u2019\u201d (Rakowsky et al., 2020). Psychiatric residencies are faced with coming up with creative solutions to address these key components of providing a strong training foundation in the midst of constantly changing policies, residents being pulled from rotations and being redirected to meet the needs of services, social distancing requirements, and infection precautions. These are unprecedented times that have allowed us to try new strategies to engage learners including virtual meetings and self-directed learning. Residency programs must continue to be conscious of their residents\u2019 health, physically and emotionally. This is done by emphasizing community, even virtually, and by encouraging residents to seek appropriate care.",

Some types of research may need to be suspended if they involve direct patient interaction but other research (such as data analysis) may continue. It is expected that the educational and teaching missions will continue uninterrupted, but perhaps in a different format with a greater emphasis on virtual techniques.
