A 2010 systematic review of patients placed in contact isolation for infection control showed adverse impacts of isolation on mental well-being, satisfaction, and several measures of patient safety.3 Conversely, provider warmth and compassion have been positively associated with physiological health biomarkers, and researchers have called for testing interventions to promote perceptions of kindness.4",

Of course, in our April 2020 US context, needed PPE itself is not always available, let alone the clinician or administrator time needed to take and print portrait photos to stick on full PPE. Preparing PPE Portraits or other humanizing approaches in anticipation of surges would have been much preferred. Still we believe PPE Portraits may support patient care and health, and even potentially healthcare team function and provider wellness. While we await data on these effects, we hope hospitals can use our findings to speed their own implementation testing.",
