This effect is partly associated with growth factors anchored in ECM and released following cleavage of HSPGs. Aim: To study the effect of heparanase involvement in hepatocyte engraftment after intrasplenic cell transplantation in partially hepatectomized (PHI') rats. Methods: Female Lewis rats (n=25) were subjected to 70% PHP and transplanted with male hepatocytes (lo7 cellslrat), pre-incubated with heparanase (50 pl, n=12), or saline as control (n=13). Engraftment efficiency was evaluated by a semi-quantitative PCR analysis of the SRY region on Y-chromosome and by histology and immunohistochemistry. PCNA immunostaining was used to estimate proliferating index of endothelial cells (EC) both in vessels and sinusoids (SEC). Results: 7/12 heparanase treated vs. only 2/13 control rats demonstrated transplanted cells within portal radicles. The number of positive portal radicles in heparanase treated rats was 6-t2.9 (meanLSEM) and 0.4620.36 in control rats (p<0.05). The transplanted treated hepatocytes appeared in clusters without signs of damage. The number of transplanted cells (mean2SEMllOmg of liver) detected in the liver was significantly higher (p<0.05) in heparanase treated animals vs. controls at 24 and 48 hrs (5.320.4",

            "text": "of well-characterized human hepatocyte cell lines could facilitate cell therapies such as HTX and bioartificial livers. Toward this goal, we have developed a tightly regulated human hepatocyte line. Methods Human hepatocytes were immortalized with a retroviral vector encoding human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNAs flanked by a pair of LoxPs. After retroviral transduction, a single cell clone was obtained using flow cytometric cell sorting followed by limiting dilution method. The resultant GFP-positive clones were supertransduced with Tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase expression cassette, MerCreMer. Recovery of the reverted form of hTERT-immortalized cells was conducted by Tamoxifen treatment and subsequent GFP-negative cell sorting with MoFlo. The expression of hepatocyte markers and albumin secretion was compared before and after Tamoxifen treatment. Transplantation effect of the reverted cells (lx lo9) into the liver were evaluated in a pig model of liver failure induce by an intravenous administration of D-galactosamine (D-gal). Resu1ts:A non-tumorigenic human hepatocyte cell line TTNT-16-T3 was established. Albumin secretion and gene expression of liver markers were increased in the reverted TTNT-16-T3 cells. Transplantation of the reverted cells via the portal vein of pigs treated with D-gal was effective to prolong the survival by providing liver support until spontaneous hepatic regeneration occurred. Conclusion: We here demonstrate reversible immortalization of human hepatocytes using Tamoxifen-induced CrelLox self-excision. The resulting cell line would be highly desirable for research and therapeutic applications. Acknowledgmenk The work was supported in part by Life Science Project of 2lst Century, Japan. Background and aim: Stem Cells play a key-role in tissue homeostasis. Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) could migrate into the liver and transdifferentiate, becoming a \"liver stem cell reserve''. We aimed to analyse: human HSC (h-HSC) ability to engraft into the mouse liver and to contribute to its regeneration after a toxic damage. Materials and methods: NODISCID mice were so divided: A) chimeric not-damaged mice: mice were submitted to irradiation followed by h-HSC intraperitoneally (i.p.) injection; finally they were killed 22, 27 and 31 days after; 8) chimerIC damageD MICE: mice were irradiated, injected with h-HSCs and, 21 days after, damaged using Ally1 Alcohol (AA), i.p.; killing was performed 1 , 5 and 10 days after the damage; C) damaged not-chimeric MICE: mice were damaged (with AA injection) and killed 1, 5 and 10 days after; D) NOT-CHIMERIC NOT-DAMAGED MICE: mice were killed without any treatment. Spleens (S), Bone Marrows (BM) and Livers (L) were tested by flow-cytometry to detect h-HSCs and immunohistochemistry (L only) to localize h-HSCs and their hepatic derivatives. Results: Flow-cytometry: group A) presence of low percentage of human cells; groups C) and D) human cells undetectable; group B) presence of low percentage of human cells in BM and S while in the L they represented up to 20% of whole cellular population (the difference respect to the group A has high statistical significance, being alpha<0.001%). Immunohistochemistry showed the human cell differentiation into parenchymal cells. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HSCs could be an option to improve thie liver regeneration after a toxic injury, supporting the feasibility of BM-derived liver stem cell hypothesis. We have previously demonstrated that CD8-mediated immune damage of allogeneic liver parenchymal cells is difficult to regulate due to the activity of \"immunoresistant\" CD8+ T cells. In prior studies we demonstrated that short-term interference with CD401 CD40L (but not CD281B7) costimulation transiently suppressed CDB-dependent hepatocyte rejection. Recently, we have determined that targetintg LFA-1 alone preferentially suppresses CD8dependent versus CD4-dependent hepatocyte rejection. In addition, short-term immunotherapy targeting both LFA-1 and CD40lCD40L costimulation produced synergistic effects and resulted in longterm suppression of CD8-dependent rejection such that hepatocyte survival up to 90 days was achieved in the majority of recipient mice. The purpose of this study was to determine whether targeting both CD40lCD40L and LFA-1 mediated signals results in an immunoregulatory state which controls naive CD8+ T cells. Methods: 2 x lo6 FVBlN (hAlAT, hepatocytes, were transplanted into CD4 KO or C57BL16.SCID (all H-2b) mice, and recipients were treated with anti-LFA-1 mAb (0.3mg d0-6) and anti-CD4OL mAb (lmg, do, 2,4,7) . Hepatocyte survival was monitored by detection of serum hAlAT reporter product by ELISA. Hepatocyte recipients with longterm survival (>60 days) were challenged by adoptive transfer of 2 million naive CDB' T cells (isolated from CD4 KO mice) which are sufficient to initiate rejection of functioning hepatocellular allografts in SCID recipients. Results: Combined treatment with anti-LFA-1 mAb and anti-CD40L mAb significantly prolonged hepatocyte allograft survival in CD4 KO mice such that 95% achieved hepatocyte survival >60 days posttransplant (MST>105 days, N= 17) in comparison to either agent alone (anti-CD40L mAb MST=35 days, N=4, P<O.OOl; anti-LFA-1 mAb MST=77 days, N=9, P<O.OOl). Recipient mice induced to achieve hepatocyte survival >60 days (by short-term treatment with anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD40L mAb) received adoptive transfer of 2 million nayve purified CD8+ T cells. Continued survival of longterm hepatocellular allografts despite adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells was observed in 60% (3 of 5) recipients. In 2 recipients, adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells was associated with loss of hepatocellular allograft function by 31 and 56 days following cell transfer. In contrast, control SCID mice with functioning hepatocellular allografts which were reconstituted with 2 million naive CD8+ T cells rapidly rejected hepatocytes with MST of 17 days (N=5). Conclusion: Targeting of both CD40l CD4OL and LFA-1 not only prevents immunoresistant CDB-dependent immune damage of liver parenchymal cells, but also x lo3 vs. 1.321.3 x lo3 and 3.920.4 x lo3 vs. 0.321.0 x 103, respectively) while at 72 hrs it was 2.4t0.8 x lo3 vs. 2.122.0 x 103 (NS) . In the spleen, significantly higher heparanase treated cells were located within the tissue, showing proliferative activity at 48 and 72 hrs post transplantation. Already by 24 hrs after transplantation the proliferating index of SEC increased from 150.5 in controls to 2256 in heparanase treated rats (I'<O.O2). Conclusions: Heparanase increases the long-term presence of transplanted cells within portal radicles, thereby facilitating their engraftment. It has also a significant effect on EC proliferation.

Arunzazu Sanchez, Peter N u n , Insa S Schroeder, Valentina M Factor, Snorri S Thorgeirsson, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, M D Substantial evidence suggests that proliferation of hepatic stem cell progenies (referred to as oval cells) is responsible for liver regeneration when the replicative capacity of hepatocytes is impaired. It is well established that activity of the TNF-a , NF-KB, IL-6, and STAT3 pathways is necessary for the regenerative response of hepatocytes following partial hepatectomy. However, much less is known about the signals mediating oval cell proliferation and differentiation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the involvement of NF-KBISTATS signaling pathways in regulation of oval cell activation. High activity of NF-KB was found in regenerating liver after AAFlPH protocol coinciding with the proliferation of oval cells. urification of the oval cell population by magnetic beads sorting using OV1 antibody confirmed that the activation of both NF-KB and STAT3 is specific for this cellular compartment. Three distinct subpopulations of oval cells were identified based on intensity of OV1 staining by FACS and named as OV1 dim, medium and bright. Real Time PCR analysis showed that they represent oval cells at different stages of differentiation along the hepatocytic lineage. OV1 dim subpopulation was the closest to the hepatic stem cell, as judged by high expression of c-kit. On the contrary, OV1 bright cells displayed the highest expression of hepatic differentiation markers, TTR, albumin, connexin 32 and HNF-4. NF-KB was uniformly activated in the entire oval cell compartment, whereas STAT3 was phosphorylated only in the most differentiated OV1 bright subpopulation. Furthermore, activation of STAT3 tightly correlated with a high proliferative activity in these cells. Together, these data provide the first evidence that the transcriptional activity supported by NF-kB and STAT3 is required for oval cell activation. The differential induction of these two transcription factors suggests that they may control different stages of oval cell activation. Disclosures:",

            "text": "Introduction: Haematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) have been shown to have greater plasticity than previously thought, with studies demonstrating that both human and rodent HSCs can differentiate into hepatocytes. Our group has also confirmed that human stem cell derived hepatocytes are the result of true differentiation and not the result of cellular fusion (Newsome et al, Gastroenterology 2003) . The extent to which endogenous HSCs are naturally mobilized and contribute to liver repair is however uncertain. Aims 1) To establish whether liver injury mobilizes endogenous HSCs into the circulation & into the liver. 2) To establish if circulating stem cells in liver injury have altered stem cell potential. Patients and Methods 4Omls peripheral blood was analysed from the following groups (n=8): normal adult controls, patients with alcoholic hepatitis, abstinent chronic alcoholic liver disease and paracetamol-induced liver injury. Using a flow cytometry sorting machine, circulating CD34 positive HSCs were quantified as a percentage of the number of mononuclear cells according to the ISHAGE flow cytometry protocol. Equal numbers of CD34 positive cells from each gmup were collected and cultured, to assess their in vitro stem cell properties, as judged by number of colony forming units (CF'Us) produced. For patients with alcoholic hepatitis, age, sex, biochemical parameters, Maddrey score and outcome (mortality) was recorded. Liver biopsies from paracetamol induced liver injury and alcoholic hepatitis patients were stained for CD34 and c-kit markers to quantitate stem cell numbers (number/ portal triad) and compared with normal adult controls. Results 1.Levels of circulating CD34 positive HSCs were significantly elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (0.19% 20.06; p<0 .05) when compared with all other groups. The corresponding CD34 positive values for the other groups are as follows: Healthy controls (0.05% 20.01); paracetamol liver injury (0.08% 20.04) and abstinent alcoholic cirrhotics (0.04% 20.002).There was no significant difference in mean mononuclear cell count between these groups. 2.Patients surviving their alcoholic hepatitis had significantly higher levels of circulating CD34 positive stem cells (0.26% 20.09; p<O.O5) when compared with those who had died (0.057% 20.03). The surviving alcoholic hepatitis patients had significantly lower Maddrey scores (22.1 92.1; p=O.OOS) than those who had died (91.67 228) whilst no significant difference in sex or age distribution was demonstrated between these two groups. The total mononuclear cell counts were lower in the deceased alcoholic hepatih group (0.85XlOX9l1 2 0.5) when compared with those that had survived (2.7XlOX911 2 0.26). If CD34 numbers are adjusted for the total mononuclear cell counts then the increase in circulating stem cells between these two groups became even more apparent (0.44 ? 0.34 and 4.98XlOX6 cellsll 24.8 ; p<0 .05). 3.HSCs from alcoholic hepatitis patients produced greater numbers of CFUs compared with adult control HSCs (245 vs.65). 4.Liver biopsies from paracetamol and alcoholic hepatitis patients contained greater numbers of stem cells compared with healthy controls (p<0.05). Control (0.65 cellsltriad ?O.l) , alcoholic hepatitis (1 cellltriad 20.17) and paracetamol liver injury (1.9 cells/ triad 2 0.35). Stem cells were only identifiedwithin the portal triads and not within the hepatic parenchyma in all of these groups. Conclusions 1. Alcoholic hepatitis is associated with increased levels of circulating HSCs both in the blood and the liver. 2. These mobilized cells display in vifro stem cell potential at a level equal to or higher than control HSCs. 3. Increased levels of stem cell mobilization are associated with improved clinical outcome. Disclosures:",

            "text": "Background KLF6 is a ubiquitously expressed Kruppel like zinc finger transcription factor identified as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer (Narla et al, Science 2001) . In addition, KLF6 is frequently lost and/or mutated in hepatocellular carcinomas (Tal-Kremer, AASLD 2002-#924) . KLF6 is also an immediate early gene that is rapidly upregulated in hepatocytes following partial hepatectomy and in hepatic stellate cells after injury. Its expression is regulated in a tissuerestricted manner during development (Laub et al, Mech Dev 2001) . These broad roles yet defined sites of expression suggested a potentially important role of KLFG in development. The aim of this project was to examine the role of KLF6 in hepatic differentiation using an embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation system in which undifferentiated cells can be driven along tissue specific lineages under defined stimuli. Materials: Two targeting constructs were generated in which the second exons of KLF6 were replaced by a neomycinllac Z cassette or hygromycin cassette. KLF6 (+/-) ES cells were generated by homologous recombination through selection with a KLF6 targeting vector containing the neomy&/lac Z cassette. To obtain KLF6 (-/-) ES cells, KLF6 (+/-) clones were subjected to the second round of homologous recombination. A l l ES cell dones were confirmed to have a normal karyotype after selection. Methods and Resulk In the undifferentiated state, KLFG (-/-)null ES cells grew more slowly than wild type ES cells, with doubling times up to 50% longer. Following differentiation into embryoid bodies (EB) over 6 days in culture, the number of EBs was reduced by > 80% compared with wild type EBs. The disparity in growth rate between wt and (-/-) ES cells was greater in later stages than in the initial 2 days of differentiation. This was accompanied by prolongation of the epiblast-like stage, associated with markedly delayed expression of endodermal mesodermal and ectodermal markers. Next, we examined the capacity of KLFG (-/-) EBs to differentiate into hepatocyte like cells by withdrawing leukemia inhibitory factor after two days, then culturing EBs under serum free conditions for 8 days, followed by growth on gelatinized dishes. Basic fibroblast growth factor and dexamethasone were added into the medium starting day 6 and day 10. Whereas expression in KLFG (+/+) EBs of alpha-fetoprotein and albumin mRNA occurred after 10 days of differentiation, their expression was almost absent and significantly delayed in KLF6 (-/-) EBs. An impaired ability of KLF6 (-/-) cells to differentiate along hematopoietic and neuronal lineages was also observed. In conclusion, these data indicate a broad and proximal role of KLFG in tissue specific development with specific role in hepatocellular development. Cell transplantation has been recognized as a possible future treatment for liver cirrhosis. One of the major questions is which cell will be of greatest useSpleen might be a major source of stem cell, if exist, since splenomegaly is a common in cirrhotic patients and even splenectomy is performed for treatment. Recent advance in the isolation technique of stem cells based on the efflux of fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33342 has turned out to be an efficient method to purify stem cells called Side population (SP) cells. We utilized this method to isolate stem cells from spleen. We also transfused these SP cells into rat liver treated with carbon tetrachloride (CC14) to see whether these SP cells proliferate and differentiate into both hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. Methods. C57/6J male mice and female NODlSCID mice were obtained from Nihon CREA. EGFP transgenic (tg) rat were obtained from Nihon SLC. Splenocytes were prepared by digesting in 0.5% collagenase solution and forcing tissue through sterile mesh. Splenocytes were then resuspended at lo6 cellslml in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 2% FBS, 1mM Hepes (HBSS+), and ug/ml Hoechst 33342 w or w/o verapamil and were incubated at 37 degrees centigrade for 90min. Splenocytes were then stained for 30min. on ice with FITC or PE conjugated various antibodies against Sca-1, c-kit, Thyl.1, CD45 and CD34. Splenocytes were washed in HBSS+ alone 3times and then in HBSS+ with 2ug/ml propidium iodide. Splenocytes were analyzed and sorted on a dual-laser FACStar Plus flow cytometer. ( excitation:36nm, emission:424/BP44 & 660/BP20 filter & 640-nm short-pass dichroic mirror). We also prepared SPcells from donor EGFP tg rats' spleen as described above. These spleen EGFP positive SP cells were directly injected into liver of anesthetized recipient NODlSCID mice. The recipient NODlSCID mice were injected with 20 ug. CC14 intrapentoneally every once a week before and after transplantation. Immunohistochemical staining were performed to identify engrafted EGFP positive cells, liver specific proteins such as cytokeratinl8J9, AFP and albumin. Results. Initial Hst333422 staining of low density splenocytes showed the SP fraction to be readily detectable ( 0.3 -1%). These cells were verapamil sensitive and could be stained with Hst33342 after verapamil treatment. The frequency of each surface markers positive cells were as follows (Table 1 and 2). Two weeks after cell transplantation, donor derived EGFP positive cells were engrafted. The some engrafted cells distributed in a cluster indicating donor cell proliferation. Hepatic differentiation of engrafted cells were shown by double staining of EGFP and rat albumin or cytokeratinld. We observed some of AFP positive cells in EGFP positive cells, but very few of cytokeratinl9 positive cells. Conclusions. The adult rodent spleen had consistently detectable fraction of SP cells. The surface marker profiles were different from those of bone marrow SP cells. The splenic SP cells could be engrafted in liver and differentiate into hepatocyte like cells. Our results suggest that splenic SP cells could be exploited for the repair of damaged liver. BackgroundlAim : It has been reported that bone marrow cells (BMCs) can replace liver in a murine model of tyrosinaemia and correct this metabolic disease through the fusion of donor BMCs to recipient hepatocytes. The aim of this study was to test whether or not this replacement is a general phenomenon in other liver injury models. The following three models were tested; (1) hepatitis B transgenic mouse (TgN(AlblHBV)), (2) albumin-urokinase transgenic mouse (TgN(AlblP1au)) and (3) carbon tetrachloride (CC14) treatment model. As the selective liver injury models, irradiated TgN(Alb1HBV) and TgN(AlblP1au) were transplanted with lx106-lx107 BMCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice (TgN(ActbEGFP)) or from @-galactosidase transgenic mice (TgN(MtnLacZ)). As a non-selective liver injury model, irradiated C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with 1x106 BMCs from TgN(ActbEGFP) or TgN(MtnLacZ) followed by the administration of CC14 (0.02mllkg animal weight, twice a week for 4 weeks). A CCI4 protocol without preparative irradiation was also tested, in which C57BL16 mice were first administered CCl, 8 times, then followed by transplantation of TgN(ActbEGFP) or TgN(MtnLacZ) BMCs. After the analysis of the donor cell engraftment in the peripheral blood, these recipient mice were sacrificed and checked for donor-derived hepatocytes at 2-47 weeks post-transplantation. Sixty liver sections for each animal (containing approximately 1 . 5~1 0~ hepatocytes), were analyzed for GFP positive cells and the whole livers were inspected for @-galactosidase expression with X-gal cytohistochemistry. However, there were no GFP positive hepatocytes and no gross blue staining of the livers with X-gal in any of the 18 recipient mice. GFP positive cells were only located in sinusoids or associated with larger vessels. They were readily distinguishable from hepatocytes through their morphology and were negative for albumin by immunostaining. In addition, the livers from 4 female animals with gender mismatched BM transplantation were also tested with Y chromosome FISH analysis, which might be a more sensitive method to detect donor derived cells than transgenic epitope tagging. Total of 5 isolated hepatocytes were positive for Y chromosome in 4 . 1~1 0~ hepatocytes analyzed, although it still remains to be elucidated whether these cells arise from spontaneous fusion events or from transdifferentiation. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that there is little or no contribution of BMCs to the replacement of injured livers in these models. Thus, we do not believe that BM derived cells can generally lead to a cure of liver damage. Background &Aims: Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are clonal cell lines derived from the inner cell mass of developing blastocysts and have multi-lineage differentiation ability. We previously reported that ES cells can be made to differentiate into hepatocytes possessing high metabolic activities by transfection of hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3b). In the present study, we investigated the expression of hepatobiliary organic anion transporters and bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (ugtlal) in undifferentiated and differentiating HNF-3btransfected ES (HNF-3 b-ES) cells.",

Undifferentiated HNF-3b-ES cells were main-tained in gelatin-coated dishes without feeder cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 mM of Z-mercaptoethanol(2ME), 0.1 mM of non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mM of sodium pyruvate and 1000 Ulml of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Undifferentiated HNF-3b-ES cells were allowed to differentiate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 mM 2-ME, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 20 nglml of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFZ) in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Differentiating HNF-3 b-ES cells were collected for RT-PCR analysis on day 14, and for Western blotting on days 14 and 28. Results: The expression of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 (oatpl), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (mrpl), mrp2, mrp3, and ugtlal was not seen in the undifferentiated HNF-3 b-ES cells by RT-PCR, whereas all were expressed in differentiating HNF-3 b-ES cells. Protein expression for oatpl, mrpl, mrp2, mrp3, and ugtlal was also observed in the differentiating HNF-3 b-ES cells by Western blotting. An immunofluorescence examination revealed that oatpl was co-located with desmoplakin, a marker for the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane, and mrp2 was co-localized with CD26, a marker for the apical (canalicular) membrane, though they were both expressed throughout most of the cell membranes. We have used cDNA microarray analysis of clonal murine hepatoblasts to identify genes that are significantly and preferentially expressed in undifferentiated hepatoblasts compared to adult mouse liver. Unique stem cell genes were identified by overexpression in undifferentiated hepatoblasts compared to adult liver. 61 genes were identified by these criteria and were designated candidate stem cell genes (CSCG). 54 CSCG were distributed on all chromosomes of the mouse except chromosomes 12,14 and the Y chromosome. However, chromosomes 2, 3 and 19 showed a preferential distribution of CSCG compared to the total number of genes mapped on these chromosomes. Approximately half of our CSCG are commonly expressed in other murine stem cell populations including embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoetic stem cells, suggesting that hepatoblasts share a molecular signature with other stem cell populations. Some of the commonly identified stem cell genes include: Sc14a2, c-myc, Nek2, phosphodiesterase 7, nicastrin, SMARCA 3 and SMARCA 5 and PIAS3. These genes function in a variety of pathways including ion transport, anion exchange, cell cycle control, chromatin organization, DNA binding activity and signal transduction. Approximately 25 % of CSCG are expressed in early endoderm, fetal liver and/or the pancreatic bud. A search for homology to known proteins indicated that some of these genes contain homology to membrane transporters, zinc finger proteins and spindle apparatus components. This class of genes is of particular interest because they may represent new hepatic lineage markers. The results of this analysis leads us to conclude that a network of pathways some of which are in common with other stem cell populations function together to maintain the liver stem cell phenotype.

RLE cells were found to express undifferentiated characteristics resembling adult liver stem cells. We have addressed cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling lineage commitment of hepatic stem cells using RLE-13. To induce RLE differentiation along the hepatocytic lineage, differentiation protocols were developed consisting of a sequential treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-cytidine (5AC), fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2 (FGF), oncostatin M (OSM) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the continuous presence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex).",

            "text": "These treatments resulted in a remarkable enlargement in cell size and organelle complexity as shown by FACS and confocal microscopy. Morphological maturation of RLE was paralleled by a decrease in cell proliferation. More significantly, RT and real time PCR analysis revealed an induction of hepatocyte specific markers such as TAT, TTR, glucose-6-phosphatase, and connexin 32. In addition mRNAs encoding liver enriched transcription factors HNF lalp, HNF 3ru, HNF 4, and ClEBP p were notably induced along with hepatocytic differentiation. The PCR results were supported by a cDNA microarray analysis. Comparison of the gene expression profiles following the treatment protocols reflected an activation of the hepatocytic differentiation program as judged by increased expression of a differentiation-associated gene set (phosphofructokinase, glutathione-S-transferase) and decreased expression of a cell cycle regulated gene set. Currently, transplantation studies are performed to identify the potential of the differentiated RLE to repopulate and restore the diseased livers. The results indicate that cell lines derived from adult liver stem cells may provide a renewable resource for transplantation. Adult liver stem cells (ADULIS) can be isolated from rodent bone marrow. When cultured under specific conditions in co-culture with isogeneic hepatocytes, ADULIS fiom 14 days bile duct ligated (BDL) rats are transdifferentiating into a hepatocyte-like lineage and are able to produce urea from ammonia. The aim of the study presented is to describe the hepatocyte specific metabolic capacity of cultured ADULIS from normal or BDL rats in single or co-culture with isogeneic hepatocytes, with or without Interleukin-3 (IL-3). Methods: ADULIS were isolated by a two-step immunoisolation procedure (i.e. Beta-2-microglobulin negativity and Thy-1 positivity) from rat femoral bone marrow (Male Wistar rats, 250g) and cultured on a matrigel layer in 24-well polystyrene dishes at a cell density of 50'000 cells/cm* in small hepatocyte media. Isogeneic hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion technique and seeded (100,000 cells/cm2) on an inlay with a collagen-coated PTFE membrane (poresize: 0.4pm) for co-culture experiments. Of note, the culture media was supplemented with 5% isogeneic serum and dexamethason M) was administered after culture day 3. IL-3 was added in the corresponding experimental groups (10nglml). After removal of the hepatocyte-inlay (in the co-culture groups) ADULIS cultures were exposed to 1.5mmol NH4CI for 5 hours in DMEM and urea formation determined thereafter with a colorimetric assay. Cells were harvested in Trizol, total RNA extracted and after reverse transcription cDNA used for real-time PCR determination of 18S(rm~) content to standardize the metabolic signal for cell number. Relative ureagenesis values were compared statistically using Jandel Scientific. The significance level was set at pC0.05. Results: The amount of ADULIS isolated from normal rat femoral bone marrow (n=lO) was 1.4620.75 x lo6 and 1.8321.97 x lo6 in animals (n=6) after seven days of BDL (p=n.s.). Relative urea synthesis in cultures from normal animals was 1.0320.42 in single and 1.3820.41 in co-culture at culture days 3, 6, 9, and 12. With addition of IL-3 to the culture media urea genesis was determined to be 1.6820.6 in single and 2.6521.0'2 in co-culture. In cell cultures from seven days BDL rats relative urea formation was 1.5821.43 in single and 2.6351.32 in co-culture. With the addition of IL-3 to the culture media values were 2.3920.51 in single and 3.1620.81 in co-culture. Addition of IL-3 to the culture media increased the metabolic signal in all cell cultures from normal animals (ANOVA on Ranks, p<0.05) but not in cultures with cells isolated from BDL animals (p=n.s.). Co-culture induced stronger ureagenesis under all culture conditions examined (Paired t-test: p<0.05). Conclusions: To exclude immunological interference from adult immunocompetent bone marrow cells cultures were strictly isogeneic (i.e. ADULIS, hepatocytes, and serum from the same animal). Co-culturing ADULIS with isogeneic hepatocytes increased ureagenesis in all paired culture experiments. As there is no direct cell contact between hepatocytes and ADULIS paracrine soluble, so far undetermined, factors must be involved. Interestingly by the addition of IL-3 transdifferentiation was inducible in cultures of ADULIS from normal animals but no additional effect was detectable in the cell cultures from BDL animals. In further studies it will be necessairy to determine if cholestatic serum also induces accelerated and more pronounced hepatocyte specific metabolic capacity in ADULIS from normal animals. Factors responsible for this transdifferentiation should then be isolated from cholestatic serum and might be used to support the failing liver in vivo potentially by activation of the ADULIS pool in the bone marrow and the liver.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon has remained unclear because of lack of effective culture system. To address this issue, we developed a novel in vitro culture system in which murine BM cells are cultured with growth factors and investigated factors required for the transdifferentiation of EM cells into hepatic linage cells. Methods and Results: (1) BM cells were isolated from the femora of 6-to 10-week-old male C57BL/6] mice. They were cultured in three-dimensional culture system using type I collagen gel and stimulated without or with the growth factors (EGF, HGF, HB-EGF, OSM, BMP-4, bFGF, FGF-4; 2OngIml) for 12 day. To investigate the effect of these growth factors, the gene expression of albumin was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. When BM cells were cultured with HGF, OSM, bFGF and FGF-4, albumin was induced effectively. Among these growth factors, bFGF was found to induce albumin the most effectively in the cultured BM cells.",

These cells proliferate in the periportal region, migrate in the lobule and differentiate into hepatocytes. Stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemokine which plays a major role during embryogenesis. Since SDF-1 and its sole receptor CXCR4 are involved in the differentiation of progenitor cells (e.g. B lymphopoiesis, digestive epithelial cell renewal), the aim of our work was to study the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in a model of hepatic regeneration from precursor cells. Hepatic regeneration from oval cells was induced by treating rats with acetylaminofluorene followed by partial hepatectomy. Rats were sacrificed the day of surgery (day 0) and at days 1,5,9,14 and 21 after partial hepatectomy. Rare oval cells were observed at day 1. Their number was moderate at day 5, marked at day 9 and 14 and declined thereafter. Oval cells predominated in the periportal region and usually formed canalar structures resembling cholangioles. Individual or cholangiole-forming oval cells strongly expressed SDF-I, as demonstrated at the mRNA level by in situ hybridization (ISH) and at the protein level by irnmunohistochemistry. Interlobular bile duct epithelial cells were also positive for SDF-1 protein but negative for its mRNA. CXCR4 mRNA hepatic levels, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, paralleled the degree of oval cell proliferation. ISH showed marked CXCR4 mRNA expression in individual as well as in cholangiole-forming oval cells. In order to determine which role the SDF-1ICXCR4 couple could play in hepatic regeneration from oval cells, rats were treated or not with fucoidan (25 mglKg ip, twice daily), a sulfated polysaccharide known to bind to SDF-1 and to block its biological effects. As compared to untreated animals, oval cell proliferation was markedly decreased in five of the seven fucoidan-treated rats.",

            "text": "In conclusion, oval cells express SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 during hepatic regeneration from precursor cells. Our results strongly suggest that the SDF-1lCXCR4 couple acts in an autocrinelparacrine way to stimulate the proliferation of these precursor cells. Disclosures: Dominique Couchie -No relationships to disclose Background: Bone marrow cells and embryonic stem cells are being used for cell transplantation. Although these cells are known to be multipotent and capable to become hepatocyte, several problems have been pointed out, such as cell fusion and teratoma generation. Thus we paid attention to side population (SP) cells, those with a verapamil-sensitive ability to efflux Hoechst 33342. SP cells have been identified in several tissues. The bone marrow SP phenotype appears to be a common feature of stem cells, but hepatic and splenic SP cells have been less well characterized. Aim: We tried to separate and culture SP cells from non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) and splenocytes, and examined whether they would obtain hepatic phenotype. Methods: 8-12-week-old female transgenic rats that ubiquitously express EGFP were used to isolate non-parencymal liver cells by the standard collagenase two-step perfusion method, and splenocytes were isolated by forcing the tissue through sterile mesh, then mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. They were resuspended at lo6 cellslml in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 2% fetal calf serum, 1mM Hepes (HBSS+), and 5uglml Hoechst 33342 (Hst) w or wlo Verapamil and were incubated at 37 degrees centigrade for 90min. Cells were washed twice in HBSS+ and then resuspended in HBSS+ with 2uglml propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed and sorted on a dual-laser FACStar Plus flow cytometer. RT-PCR was performed with RNA extracted from freshly isolated SP cells. Isolated SP cells were cultured with male rat primary cultured hepatocytes in collagen gel sandwich. Cell morphology was monitored under a phase-contrast microscope and a fluorescence microscope. The expression of albumin, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 19 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the sry gene was performed to exclude ceIL fusion. Results: The rate of NPC-SP was 0.05% of isolated NPCs. 89% of NPC-SP expressed CD45, while 55% of NPC main population (MP) did. Freshly isolated SP cells were smaller than mature hepatocytes. They looked like monocytes or lymphocytes. These cells did not express liver specific markers, such as albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, cytokeratin 18, or cytokeratin 19. During one-week culture with hepatocytes using collagen gel sandwich method, we could find no change in GFP-positive SP cells, but after further culture, we found several colonies consisting of GFP-positive SP cells, whose shape became polygonal. After 2-week-culture, most of GFP-positive cells were stained positive for albumin. NPC-SP cells died within one week without hepatocyte co-culture. NPC-MP cells formed colonies after 2 weeks culture with hepatocytes, but unlike SP cells, they looked like fibroblasts and were negative for albumin. Freshly isolated SP cells from splenocytes were also small and monocyte-like, and expressed no liver specific markers. Spleen SP cells could culture for more than 2 weeks in the same way as NPC-SP cells, and looked like hepatocytes, but did not proliferate. After having been cultured, most of GFP-positive cells were stained positive for albumin and cytekeartin 18, and negative for cytokeartin 19; on the other hand splenic main population cells after 2 weeks' culture expressed those very little. Conclusion: We succeeded in culturing liver and spleen SP cells. SP cells which did not express mRNA of liver specific markers, such as albumin or cytokeratin 18, became to express those after the culture with hepatocytes. These results suggest that these SP cells have plasticity and obtain hepatic function. Thus, tissue stem cells, especially SP cells, are useful for cell transplantation. Spleen SP cell might be a candidate for source of cell transplantation for treatment of liver cirrhosis. Miura, Takashi Goto, Ken-ichiro Mikami, Kunio Nakane, Kazuo Yoneyama, Hirokazu Nagai, Kunihiko Terada, Toshihiro Sugiyama, Katsuyuki Imai, Haruki Senoo, Sumio Watanabe, Akita University, Akita, Japan Background Epimorphin, a mesenchymal cell surface-associated molecule identified as an epithelial morphogen, is detected on stellate cells in the liver. We have reported that a contact with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) promotes differentiation of hepatic stem-like cells (HSLCs). Here, we show the involvement of epimorphin in that process.Materials and Methods: HSLCs and HSCs were isolated from healthy adult rats using two-step collagenase perfusion and Percoll gradient centrifugation, and maintained standard medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HSLCs were cultured in stellate cell-conditioned medium, co-cultured with HSCs to maintain cellcell contact or in the presence of epimorphin. Phenotypical and morphologic changes were investigated by RT-PCR and with an electron microscopy, respectively. Results: HSLCs are polygonal in shape and assume a cobblestone appearance when cultured in standard medium. Transmission electron microscopy showed that HSLCs , 20 to 25 micro-m in diameter, have a round to ovalshaped nucleus, a few vacuoles, scant organelles and a high nucleuslcytoplasm ratio compared with normal hepatocytes. The phenotypic properties of HSLCs did not change as well as their size and shape during this experiment. HSLCs characterized by RT-PCR are follows: positive, c-kit, musashi-1 (a neural stem cell marker), alpha-fetoprotein, cytokeratinl9, connexin43; negative, albumin, transferrin, tyrosine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. HSLCs cultured in stellate cell-conditioned medium had no phenotypical and morphological changes. HSLCs co-cultured with HSCs expressed albumin, transferrin, and tyrosine aminotransferase, which were inhibited by an anti-epimorphin antibody. Furthermore, epimorphin induced the markers not only for hepatocytes including albumin, transferrin and tyrosine aminotransferase, but also for cholangiocytes including gammaglutamyl transpeptidase in addition to increased expression of connexin43 and cytokeratinl9, with decreased expression of c-kit and musashi-1. In addition, ClEBP beta was enhanced, which has been reported to mediate through morphogenesis by epimorphin. HSLCs co-cultured with HSCs piled up and subsequent development of bile-canalicui-like structures, which was dramatically inhibited by an anti-epimoirphin antibody. HSLCs, close to epimorphin, stated piling up, changed their shape from flat to cuboidal, became rich in mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum and formed bile-canalicui-like structures. Conclusions: HSLCs have a self-renewing capacity and multilineage differentiation potential. Epimorphin is involved in differentiation of HSLCs though a contact with HSCs. Disclosures: Takashi Goto -No relationships to disclose n order to identify new and differentially expressed genes in fetal rat liver that are specific for epithelial stemlprogenitor cells and genes involved in liver progenitor cell differentiation, we used murine cDNA microarrays containing 8,976 cDNAs, available at the Functional Genomic Facility, AECOM. The expression pattern of fetal liver stemlprogenitor cells was studied from embryonic day 13 through birth, 7 days after birth and in adult liver. The driver RNAs were isolated from cells adhered to the dish after plating the cell suspension in order to remove the blood cells. Reference RNA was isolated from the livers of newborn rats. We found that 511 genes present on the cDNA microarrays were developmentally regulated. These genes fall in two major hierarchical clusters, according to their pattern of expression. The 281 genes that are down-regulated during fetal liver development were distributed in functional groups and further analyzed. In this study, special attention was paid to genes that were induced in fetal liver but were not expressed (or expressed at a very low level) in adult liver. These genes are of special interest because they can serve as specific markers for identification and for isolation of liver stemlprogenitor cells. In addition, these genes represent links to understanding the fetal liver specific molecular pathways that govern cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis and differentiation.",

            "text": "To determine which of the 281 over-expressed genes in 13-14 day fetal liver that are down-regulated in adult liver are progenitor cells specific, we searched in the available databases whether the expression of these genes in adult liver was previously reported. Seventy genes were further analyzed: the clones of interest were hybridized to radioactive labeled 32P cDNA synthesized from fetal and adult liver RNAs. For 48 of the clones, we found that there was little or no expression in adult liver. The expression level of 25 selected clones was analyzed further by quantitative PCR, and they were confirmed as highly induced in fetal hepatoblasts compared to adult liver. Half of the 48 clones are ESTs. The known genes fall in different categories, the major four being: genes related to transcription; signal transduction; morphogenesis, histogenesis and organogenesis; cell adhesion, de-adhesion and migration. Some of the known genes over-expressed in fetal liver that are not expressed or expressed at very low level in adult liver are: GrblO (AA260248), Fh12 (AA023645), Tnc (AA270625), Peg3 (AA003064), Hey1 (AA049474), Enah ((AA217593), Pkcd (AA276844), Lox (W96914), Shcbpl (AA265225), Magoh (AA254528), Manba (AA200473), Klf5 (AA432818), Gpc3 (AA274932), Pcolce2 (AA153907), Ppap2c (AA220316), Nfkb2 (AA060802), Adam19 (AA051790), Akapl2 (AA387076), Tagln (BC003795. It should be noted, that most of the 48 clones and all those listed here that we have identified as liver progenitor cells specific, are expressed in stem cells of embryonic, hematopoietic, or mesenchymal origin. Two of the presented genes encode cell surface proteins: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 19 (Adaml9) (meltrin beta), glypican 3. Using in situ hybridization, we are currently verifying whether our putative liver progenitor cell specific genes are expressed in hepatoblasts and in rare progenitor cells that remain in the adult liver. Identifying and cloning new genes that are expressed uniquely in liver stemlprogenitor cells will allow us to design a method for isolation of these cells and to study their role in liver development, growth control and regeneration. Hepatocyte transplantation has been shown to be an effective treatment for liver diseases including fulminant hepatic failure and metabolic defects in liver function. However, the availability of sufficient numbers of hepatocytes with which to conduct clinical studies limits the wide-spread availability of this therapy. Previously, we have shown that human placenta derived stem cells (PDSC) differentiate along neural or hepatic lineages depending on the culture conditions and suggested that these stem cells could be a source of cells for clinical transplantation. Here we report on a protocol to further optimize hepatic differentiation of PDSC. A three stage culture system was applied to induce hepatic differentiation. AE cells were propagated in DMEM based standard media which contains EGF 10 nglml for a week (Stage I) and subsequently with growth factors such as FGF-1, 2, 4, 7, 8, Oncostatin M, HGF, andlor dexamethasone (DEX) and insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) for 2 weeks (stage 11). The cells were then changed to media supplemented with different nuclear hormone receptor agonists for 1 week to stimulate hepatic maturation (stage 111). Total RNA samples were examined for hepatocyte specific gene expressions with real-time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR). Additional studies examined hepatic differentiation on different culture substrates including collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, ARG-GLY-ASP-SER, and Matrigel 1%, 20%, 100% were also examined. In the three stage differentiation system, 20% (vlv) Matrigel coated plates and DEXlITS containing media, and phenobarbital (PB) were identified as the best conditions to upregulate liver specific gene expression. The principal human drug-metabolizing enzymes (Cytochrome P-450, CYP) were also examined by RTQ-PCR. CYPlA1, 2C8,2D6, and 3A4 were induced with either rifampicin or PB. In parallel, expression of the relevant liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF-4, ClEBP-a and CIEBP-b mRNAs were increased under conditions which induced hepatic differentiation. Under slightly different conditions, differentiation of PDSC into cells which expressed Pax6, PDXl and Nkx2.2, insulin and glucagon was observed. Flow cytometric analysis showed isolated nayve AE cells contains a population of cells which express the embryonic stem (ES) cell markers, SSEA-3, 4, TRA 1-60, and TRA 1-81. Furthermore, the placental stem cells formed embryonic body (EB)-like structure when cells were cultured on Matrigel. The EB-like structures retained the expression of SSEA-3, 4, TRA 1-60, and TRA 1-81. These data indicate that cells can be isolated from term placenta which express markers of ES cells. Under appropriate conditions PDSC expand, and differentiate into cells with characteristics of hepatocytes, neurons, or pancreatic cells. We propose that PDSC could provide a new source of cells for clinical transplantation and regenerative medicine. Unlike with ES cells, there should be no social, ethical or religious objections to the isolation and use of placental-derived stem cells. Using the SSH technology, we have identified previously 643 induced clones in 13 day fetal compared to adult liver; 202 of these clones were independent transcripts, 64 of them represented ESTs and4 appeared to be new sequences (Petkov et al., Genomics 6 8 197-209,2000) . Applying the rapid amplification of 5' and 3' cDNA ends to subtracted genes (GeneRace Kit, Invitrogen), we have obtained the full-length cDNAs for two of the subtracted clones.",

            "text": "One of them (clone 2G8) encodes a novel putative serine proteasel subtilase highly expressed in fetal liver and comparatively low in adult. The expression of 2C8 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blots with RNA isolated from different rat tissues: fetal and adult liver, isolated 14 day fetal hepatoblasts, brain, bone marrow, kidney, spleen, intestine, colon, stomach and muscle. On Northern blot with total RNA, a strong signal was detected with fetal liver/ hepatoblasts RNA and a weak signal with adult liver RNA, which showed that the expression of this mRNA is developmentally regulated. To confirm the liver specific expression of 2G8, quantitative RT-PCR was camed out. The results of this analysis confirmed our previous results and revealed also a very low expression of 2G8 mRNA in the colon. The 2G8 cDNA is 3345 nucleotides in length and codes for a novel protein of 691 amino acids. We were able to identify in the data bases the sequences of a rat contig which contains the complete gene for 2G8. The gene coding for 2G8 comprises 21,920 bp of the rat genome and includes 12 exons and a long 3'-UTR segment of 1,000 nucleotides. The initiation of the translation begins with an AUG codon, 188 nucleotides downstream from the 5'-end of mRNA. Using specific primers designed from the contig sequences, we obtained clones corresponding to the upstream promoter region and downstream of the gene in the PCR4 TOP0 vector (Invitrogen). These two upstream and downstream clones were ligated to the 2C8 cDNA upstream and downstream sequences, respectively, so that the whole gene with the 5' and 3' regulatory sequences was obtained in the PCR4-TOP0 vector. Analysis of the structure of 2G8 showed that this protein resembles 8 others mammalian subtilases, named convertases described during the last decade: furin, PC1/3, PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC516 and PC7ILPCIPC8 and SKI-1ISIP. These proteases are synthesized as proproteins and secreted from the cell. 2G8 contains a putative signal sequence for release from the ER located between amino acid 30 and 31 (alanine 4 glutamine). However, it does not share the consensus cleavage sequences characteristic for the other convertases: (K,R)-(X)n-(K,R) for processing, release and secretion of the active enzyme form. At present, we do not know the processing site of the proprotein. In situ hybridization experiments showed that this serine protease is expressed in fetal liver hepatoblasts. Convertases are secretory proproteins implicated in tissue specific processing of hormones, growth factors, metalloproteinase, extracellular matrix proteins, viral proteins etc. They show tissue specificity and some are implicated in development and differentiation. 2G8 is a novel convertase, it is developmentally regulated and most likely functions in processing and activation of growth factorslcytokines or extracellular matrix proteins implicated in morphogenesis. Further studies of its promoter region will reveal the control sequences and transcriptional activators and repressors regulating its expression during development.

            "text": "METHODS: 2 month old female mice transgenic for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs-tg) received lethal irradiation and were then transplanted with C57B1/6J male BMCs by tail vein injection. 6 weeks later half the mice were treated with retrorsine, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid, to irreversibly block proliferation of endogenous hepatocytes. Mice were sacrificed at 3 and 6 months following retrorsine injections. Y chromosome containing hepatocytes were identified using in situ hybridisation and phenotype markers (positivity for cytokeratins 8/18, cytochrome P450 and glycogen, negative for CD45). RESULTS: In the control mice with chronic liver damage there was an increase in Y chromosome positive hepatocytes over time, but the proportion remained <5% of the total number of hepatocytes. However, 19.3% (corrected count) of Y chromosome containing hepatocytes could be found repopulating the livers of the mice that had received retrorsine. CONCLUSIONS: BMCs contribute to the regeneration of the chronically damaged liver, but under conditions where regeneration of endogenous hepatocytes is possible this is minor. However, when chronic liver damage occurs and regeneration of the endogenous hepatocytes is inhibited, the contribution to liver regeneration from the bone marrow is significantly enhanced. Beaujon, Paris, France; Thierry Poynard, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France Background Portal hypertension depends in part on the development of hepatic fibrosis. Thus, since FibroTest (FT) is a potential biochemical marker of fibrosis, this test was prospectively used to evaluate the presence and severity of portal hypertension in patients with different liver diseases. Methods: 89 consecutive patients (56 males; 32% chronic viral hepatitis C, 9% hepatitis 8, 33% alcoholic liver disease, 7% transplanted, 19% miscellaneous) with transjugular liver biopsy had same day measurements done for hemodynamic parameters (gradient, free hepatic, wedged pressures), histological parameters (Fibrosis scoring system in 4 stages, necroinflammatory activity grades and modification of architecture in 3 classes), and biochemical parameters via blood sample (FT for fibrosis and ActiTest for activity). The measurements of histological and biochemical parameters were done blind to any other characteristics. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), predictive values (NPV and PPV), Spearman correlation (SC), accuracy (AC), kappa (K) and the area under the ROC curves (AUROC) were assessed. The main endpoint was the prediction of elevated portal pressure (EPP), defined by a gradient of 2 5 mm Hg. The secondary endpoint was the prediction of highly elevated portal pressure (HEPP) of 212 mm Hg (HEPP). Results: The mean FT value was 0.47 (se 0.05) for 15 patients without EPP, 0.73 (0.04) in 23 patients with moderate EPP and 0.87 (0.03) in 49 patients with HEPP (p<O.Ol between all groups, Dunnett's multicomparison test) (Figure 1 ). High AUROCs of FT were obtained for the prediction of EPP, 0.86 (0.04) and HEPP 0.78 (0.05); a cutoff at 0.70 had a 95% PPV for the presence of EPP (Se=76%, Sp=80%) and a 0.45 cutoff had a 100% NPV for the exclusion of HEPP (Se=100%, Sp=28%). There was a significant correlation between FT and gradient (SC= 0.50, p<O.OOl). The AUROC of FT for the histological architectural disturbance (fibrosis or cirrhosis) was very high 0.94, (0.03). There were also excellent FT diagnostic values for stages F2F3F4 AC=87%; K=0.54 (0.11); SC =0.57, p<O.OOl; AUROC=0.87 (0.04). Therefore histological staging did not give higher diagnostic values than FT for EPP, AUROC=0.91, (0.03) INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of gastric varices ranges from 20-25% in cirrhotic patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Conventional endoscopic hemostatic treatment is not effective for gastric variceal bleeding. TIPS can achieve initial control of bleeding but it is associated with high cost, shunt dysfunction, and increased encephalopathy. Cyanoacrylate injection has been shown to be very effective with 90% hemostasis and low rebleeding rates of 0-28%. In our current series of gastic varix patients at the University of Virginia, injection with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) has yielded similar results (Scaldwell, FDA-IDE). However, distal embolization after N-butyl-2-cyanoaaylate injection has been reported and probably results from \"beading\" upon polymerization. Whether other cyanoacrylates with different physical-chemical properties have less embolic risk with equal or greater efficacy remains to be determined. &To investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of two different cyanoacrylates in the management of gastric varices. METH-ODS:Polymerization properties of two cyanoacrylates, N-butyl-2cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) and octyl-cyanoacrylate (Dermabond), were compared in vitro by adding a drop of blood to different concentrations of N-butyl-2-cyanoacry1atel:ethiodol and octyl-cyanoacry-1ate:ethiodol (ethiodol, iodinated poppy seed oil, is radio opaque and delays polymerization). The two cyanoacrylates were then compared for \"beading\" by injecting each cyanoacrylate solution into a flowing circular system of fresh frozen plasma and then collecting the resultant polymer. Lastly, cyanoacrylate injection was tested in an animal model using the femoral vein of a pig to simulate a gastric varix. Each femoral vein was injected with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and octyl-cyanoacrylate, respectively, and then both veins were ligated and examined for histologic change. RESULTS N-butyl-2-cyanoacry1ate:ethiodol (1:l) and octyl-cyanoacrylate alone had similar polymerization properties as far as initiation of polymerization to formation of a \"hard substance\"these concentrations were used for subsequent testing. Preliminary results from the circular flowing system show that N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate forms a \"beaded\" and \"crystallized\" polymer whereas the octyl-cyanoacrylate polymer is more \"stringy\" and \"rubbery\". In the animal model, N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate had formed a large, extended thrombus in the vein with an irregular surface that appeared granular. In contrast, octyl-cyanoacrylate appeared uniform throughout and occluded the vein wall with only a s m d thrombus in the center. CONCLUSION Octyl-cyanoacrylate appears to be a viable alternative with possible lower embolic risk. Vessel occlusion appears to involve a combination of polymer and thrombus formation, although interaction with the dotting cascade has not been adequately investigated. Further studies in an animal model of gastric varices are in development to assess the relative safety and efficacy of these and other cyanoacrylates. Disclosures:",

            "text": "To evaluate the accuracy of BE to diagnose esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension at an early stage. Patients and methods: 45 patients with liver cirrhosis where evaluated by EGD (Japanese General Criteria), as a gold standard and BE for the presence and size (small, large) of varices. X-rays were taken within 3 weeks of endoscopy, with 98% barium sulfate (E-Z-HD), as suspension adjusted for double contrast studies and barium paste (E-Z, 60%, esophageal cream) for mucous coating. Results: 45 patients diagnosed by liver Biopsy; 60% postnecrotic, 20% cryptogenic, 10% NASH, 10% alcohol. 90% were Child-Pugh's score A and 10% were Child-Pugh's R. The correlation between EGD and BE was very high; r=0.84, P<O.OOOl. There were only 4 false negative results with BE. Overall sensitivity of RE was 89%. All large varices (F2-F3) were diagnosed by BE. Sensitivity declined with F1 varices to 73%. The positive predictive value was 86%. The cost of X-rays was one fourth that of EGD. Conclusions: RE can be used as a non invasive procedure for the screening of patients with varices and compensated liver disease at a minimal cost. Using BE will allow to avoid universal prophylaxis with beta-blockers. Studies dealing with the prevention of rebleeding have shown that hemodynamic response to pharmacological treatment of portal hypertension is adequate when the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) decreases to ?12mmHg or by ?20% from baseline. With beta-blockers these targets are achieved in only around 30% of cases. However, even with such a high rate of poor hemodynamic response, variceal bleeding occurs in few patients when beta-blockers are used for primary prophylaxis (around 15%). The aim of this study was to assess whether the cut-off value to define response in primary prophylaxis may be defined more accurately and to investigate whether the acute response to beta-blockers may predict evolution (avoiding a second study). METHODS: A total of 101 cirrhotic patients with large varices and without pre-vious bleeding were investigated. A baseline hemodynamic study was performed in all patients. After initial measurements, propranolol was administered in 55 patients (0.15mg/kg i.v.) and measurements were repeated 20 minutes later. Subsequently, nadolol was chronically administered to prevent variceal bleeding. A second hemodynamic study was performed 1 to 3 months later in 72 patients. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 37 months, 17% of patients had a bleeding episode and 19% died. There was a significant correlation between acute and chronic hemodynamic response to beta-blockers (r=0.6, P=O.OOl). Using ROC curve a decrease of HVPG ?lo% from baseline was the better cut-off point to predict bleeding, both for acute and chronic studies. Hemodynamic responders (defining response as a decrease of HVPG to ?12mmHg or ?lo%), had a significantly lower probability of bleeding (P?O.Ol) and of requiring hospital admission because decompensations of cirrhosis, while survival probability was higher, both after acute and chronic beta-blocker administration. The HVPG decreased ?20% in 38% of cases and decreased ?lo% in 74% (P?O.OOl) after acute beta-blocker. These figures were 31% vs 68% (P?O.OOl) after a chronic administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that: 1) A decrease of HVFG ?lo% from baseline may be the target to identify hemodynamic responders in primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding; 2) ,4cute hemodynamic response to beta-blockers may provide an accurate prognostic information on long-term risk of variceal bleeding. UT; William M Grosse, Corneliu Sanda, Milton Taylor, lndiana University, Bloomington, IN Treatment of chronic Hepatitis C patients with type 1 interferon (IFN-alpha) and ribavirin leads to a sustained virologic response in -50% of patients. The elimination of serum HCV RNA in an individual patient displays biphasic kinetics with the first order attributed to the direct antiviral effects of IFN-alpha and the second order attributed to an immune mediated clearance of infected cells by induction of TH1 cytokines, primarily IFNgamma (type 2 IFN). We have postulated that the direct antiviral effects as well as the TH1 response of current therapies may be enhanced by the addition of type 2 IFN (IFN-gamma). To study this hypothesis, we examined the activity of a type 1 IFN, Infergen; (IFN-alfaconl) in combination with a type 2 IFN, Actimmune; (IFN-gamma l b ) in preclinical models of HCV. These included an infectious flavivirus system (West Nile Virus) and the HCV replicon. In addition, global transcriptional profiling was examined utilizing the HG-U133A Genechip; (Affymeirix, Santa Clara, California) system. Effective Concentration (EC) studies of the l effects of IFN-alfaconl, IFN-gamma l b and the combination against the West Nile Virus and the HCV replicon are shown below: Analysis of synergy for the combination of IFN-alfaconl and IFNgamma l b in the HCV replicon using the Chau-Talalay methodology demonstrated very strong synergistic effects for a range of doses (C1<0.1 for all observations). Initial statistical analysis (PV<O.OOl; Fold Change 2 1.2) of global transcriptional profiling revealed that treating HCV replicon containing cells with IFNalfaconl up-regulated 156 transcripts, while 61 transcripts were significantly down-regulated. IFN-gamma l b treated cells had 109 transcripts up-regulated and 32 down-regulated transcripts. Most significant was the finding that several transcripts were up-regu-lated by the combination of IFN-alfaconl and IFN-gamma l b that were not up-regulated by either IFN alone. These transcripts were involved in cell-cycle regulation, antigen presentation, apoptosis and immuno-activation. In addition, several known interferon stimulated genes were highly elevated by the combination when compared to the monotherapy treatments. These results demonstrate synergistic effects of the combination of type 1 and type 2 IFNs for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C both on a cellular and molecular level. Further study in HCV infected patients is warranted. HCV is leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clearance of HCV is associated with strong T cell immunity to HCV immunogens including the non-structural NS3 protein (NS3). Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in priming rare antigen specific T cells to initiate protective HCV immunity. Therefore, DCs are an important target to elicit broader and more robust immune responses against HCV. To target immunogens to DCs, 12-mer peptides were screened from a phage display peptide library for specific binding to human DCs. A candidate 12-mer peptide (DC-peptide# 3) was identified that bound human monocyte-derived DCs. DC-peptides bind to ligands that are strongly involved in receptor mediated endocytosis. DC-peptides could be linked to HCV NS3 biochemically or fused genetically with preservation of DC targeting specificity and immunogenicity. DCs pulsed with NS3 that has been genetically fused to DC peptide augmented T ceIl proliferation >3 fold better thanNS3 alone, and skewed T cells towards Thl polarization resulting in elevated levels of IFN-.)I (higher than with NS3 alone) but not IL-4 or IL-10. T cells also acquired an activated phenotype (CD69+). To test in viva efficacy of NS3-DC peptide fusion protein, NOD-SCID mice were xenotransplanted with HCV-nake T cells, and vaccinated with three separate weekly injections of autolo-gous DCs (106) pulsed with nothing, NS3 alone, or the NS3-DC pep-tide#3 fusion construct. Vaccination using DCs pulsed with NS3-DC peptide# fusion protein significantly increased NS3-specific T cell proliferationlactivation and enhanced the expression of IFN-y, and TNF-a compared to NS3 alone but no detectable levels of IL-10 or IL-4 were observed. These data indicate that targeting HCV subunits to DCs using specific DC-peptides represents a novel vaccine approach that may facilitate targeting of immunogenic antigens to DCs to elicit specific T cell immune responses against NS3 of HCV. This immunotherapeutic strategy can be implemented against the broad range of immunogenic antigens of various pathogens. It has recently been reported that the administration of Eta in the setting of chronic HCV infection enhances IFN-induced viral clearance (1). The mechanism of these synergistic effects remains to be understood. Our hypothesis was that Eta enhances antiviral effects of IFN by increasing T cell reactivity to antigens. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated in CPT tubes from blood of two healthy volunteers. Cells were washed and then cultured in complete media 24-well plates in the absence of any antigen (negative control) and in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 antibody (I-CD3, 150 nglml, positive control) as a nonspecific T cell stimulant. I-CD3 stimulated cells were treated immediately with Peg IFN alpha-2a at two different concentrations consistent with physiologic doses in humans (10 nglml or 100 nglml) with or without the addition of Eta at two different concentrations that were also consistent with physiologic doses in humans (1.65 pglml or 3.30 pglml). Supernatants from each of the previous conditions were collected and assessed by ELISA for IFN-7 secretion as a marker of T cell activation. Results: Our findings are displayed in the figure below. There was no spontaneous IFN-7 detected in cells that were not stimulated. IFN-y was detected at a modest level after exposure to I-CD3 alone, a response that became greater after exposure of cells to Peg IFN alone or Eta alone. Production of IFN-7 was substantially enhanced in cells that were exposed to a combination of Peg IFN and Eta compared to those exposed to Peg IFN alone or Eta alone. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Eta has a synergistic effect to that of Peg IFN in promoting in vitro activation of PBMCs and IFN-7 production in healthy individuals. Increased T cell activation with Eta may also suggest that TNFA suppress T cell function and may contribute to refractoriness to INF therapy in HCV patients. The influence of absolute dose and dose in mg per kg body weight of ribavirin on sustained virologic response (SVR) in interferonbased combination treatment of chronic hepatitis C as well as the influence of dose reduction is still controversial.",

Thereby, we used a multivariate approach to account for correlations of the dose of ribavirin with body weight and body mass index (BMI) and known predictor variables from this data set which are low baseline HCV RNA, high platelet counts, high pretreatment ALT, and low y glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) as well as HCV genotype non-1. Because per protocol dosage of ribavirin was weight-adjusted (1000 mg for body weight below 75 kg and 1200 mg for body weight 75 kg or more) and body weight was positively correlated with GGT and negatively correlated with platelet counts (Spearman rank correlation, p<O.Ol% and p=0.2'X), respectively, we used a stratification with respect to genotype (GT 1 vs. non-1), GGT, and platelet counts in the analysis of ribavirin dose. When comparing body weight, BMI, the absolute intention to treat (ITT) ribavirin dose as well as the ITT dose of ribavirin measured in mg per kg body weight and the respective ribavirin doses at the end of treatment (EOT), a significant association with SVR was found for the EOT ribavirin dosage (mg per kg body weight) and BMI (p=1.8% and p=3.0%, respectively). For predicting SVR, a weight-based ribavirin dosage threshold of 13.75 mg/kg was calculated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The SVR rate was 66% (1121169) in patients with a ribarivin dose of more than 13.75 mglkg as compared with 46% (79l172) in patients receiving equal or less than 13.75 mglkg ribavirin at EOT (odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.5-3.6; p=O.l%).",

Improved adherence to the medical regimen increases sustained response rates. Data currently available regarding dose reduction, discontinuation and SVR are largely derived from registration trials with experienced hepatologists at academic centers. Anecdotal information suggests that dose reduction and discontinuation rates are higher and SVR lower in community practice, where the majority of HCV patients are treated. Actual dose reduction and discontinuation rates and SVR in community practice are unknown. Aim: We sought to determine dose reduction and discontinuation rates and SVR in community practice in comparison with academic centers within the context of a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial. Methods: Patients with chronic HCV (+HCV RNA) were evaluated at academic centers and community sites within the context of a randomized trial comparing Peg IFN a (1.0 pglkglwk) + ribavirin (800-1400 mgld) vs. Peg IFN a (1.5 pglkglwk) + ribavirin (800-1400 mg/d). Demographic, serological (ALT), virological (HCV RNA level and genotype) and histological data were obtained. Eligible patients were randomized to one treatment group. Medications were administered for 24 weeks (HCV GT non-1) or 48 weeks (HCV GT 1). Tolerability (dose reduction rates, adverse events and discontinuation rates) through week 24 of therapy was determined and comparisons were made between academic (AC) and community-based centers (CC). Results: 294 patients have been enrolled, 74 in AC and 220 in CC. 6 patients in AC and 80 in CC remain on therapy within the initial 24 weeks and are not included in this report. Genotype, histology, gender and age profiles were similar in the 2 groups. * designates a significant difference p<0.05. By week 24,7168 (10 %) in AC discontinued medications in comparison to 29/140 (21%) in CC\". 3/68 (4%) discontinuations were due to AEfSAE in AC in comparison to 101140 (7%) in CC. 2155 (4%) patients in AC who did not discontinue by wk 24 received Peg IFN dose reduction in comparison to 23/108 (21%) in CC\". 14/55 (25%) patients in AC who did not discontinue by week 24 received ribavirin dose reduction in comparison to 31/108 ( The clinical outcome in response to combination therapy for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection appears to be different for Caucasian versus African American patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and interferon alpha-2b has generally been found to be more effective for eliminating HCV in Caucasians. The present study has been undertaken to further define this difference in response to therapy between Caucasians and African Americans and to determine whether the difference may be related to a difference in T cell-dependent immune responses to HCV in the two patient populations. To this end peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from patients prior to the initiation of combination therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon alpha-2b, week 0, and at 28 weeks and 44 weeks after initiation of therapy. The PBMC were stimulated in vitro with recombinant HCV-superoxide dismutase (SOD) fusion proteins for NS3 (SOD-C33c), core (SOD-C22-3), NS4 (SOD-C100-3), NS5 (SOD-NSS), and the relevant recombinant SOD controls from yeast or bacteria (all generous gifts from Dr. Michael Houghton, Chiron). After four days, 3H-tymidine was added to the cultures and incubation continued for 16 hours to measure proliferation. The cultures were harvested on day five. Supernatants from identical cultures were collected for assay of TH1, IL-2 and interferon gamma (INFy), and T H~, IL-10 and IL-4, cytokine production. T cell responses to tetanus toxoid and the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were used as positive controls for T cell response potential. To date 68 patients have entered the study. Week 0 data has been collected from 64 patients and 9 normal controls. Data have been collected from only 25 patients that have completed the study through week 44. The results indicate that generally all patients' T cells were stimulated by PHA and to lesser extent tetanus toxoid. The major cytokine stimulated by both PHA and tetanus toxoid was INFy. Few of the patients had significant T cell responses to HCV proteins at time 0 measured either as proliferation or cytokine production. Over the period of combination therapy, most patients in which serum virus titers were reduced to non detectable levels had significant increases in T cell responses to HCV proteins. Although T cell proliferation was varied among the patients, there was generally a marked increase in INFy production but little production of other cytokines. Responses to HCV proteins were less consistent in those patients that either did not clear the virus or in which there was resurgence of virus after initial clearance. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major world-wide health problem causing chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and primary liver cancer (HCC). The high frequency of treatment failure points to the need for more specific, less toxic and more active antiviral therapies for HCV. The HCV NS3 serine protease is currently regarded as a prime target for anti-viral drugs, thus specific inhibitors of its activity are of utmost importance. Intracellular biological processes can be specifically manipulated by anti-viral antibodies. We have recently presented the modulation of HCV NS3 serine protease transforming activity by non-neutralizing recombinant intracellular antibodies (Intrabodies). We herein report the development of a novel bacterial genetic screen for inhibitors of NS3 serine protease catalysis and its application for the isolation of single-chain antibody-inhibitors. Our screen is based on the concerted co-expression of a reporter gene, of recombinant NS3 and of stabilized single-chain antibodies (scFvs) in E. coli. The reporter system had been constructed by inserting a short peptide corresponding to the NS5AIB cleavage site of NS3 into a permissive site of the enzyme p-galactosidase. The resulting cleavable lac2 gene is carried on a low copy plasmid that also carries the NS3 coding sequence. The resultant P-galactosidase enzyme when active, conferring a Lac' phenotype (blue colonies on indicative X-gal plates) while co-expression of active NS3 results in loss of / 3 -galactosidase activity (transparent colonies on X-gal plates). The identification of inhibitors, as shown here by isolating NS3 inhibiting single-chain antibodies is based on the appearance of blue colonies (NS3 inhibited) on the background of colorless colonies (NS3 active). Our source of inhibitory scFvs was a scFv library we prepared from spleens of NS3-immunized mice. Once isolated, the inhibitors were validated as genuine and specific NS3 binders by an ELISA and as bone fide NS3 serine protease inhibitors by an in vitro catalysis assay. These antibodies are also analyzed for intracellular immunization against HCV NS3 serine protease, as inhibiting intracellular antibodies. Single chain NS3 neutralizing antibodies may emerge as useful clinical reagents for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. Our genetic screen, although applied here for the isolation of antibody-based inhibitors, should be applicable for the identification of candidate inhibitors from other sources. 1ntroduction:Genetic heterogeneity is an important feature of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genomes with six known genotypes and more than 50 subtypes. Genotypes 1,2 and 3 are broadly distributed in patients around the world, whereas the other types are more geographically restricted. The peptidomimetic inhibitor BILN 2061, optimized to have a high affinity for genotype 1 NS3 protease, has been reported to reduce viral load in genotype 1 HCV infected individuals. In this study, the ability of BILN 2061 to inhibit the NS3 proteases from the other widespread genotypes 2 and 3 was assessed. Methods: The NS3 protease domains and the NS3-NS4A proteins of genotypes la, lb, 2ac, 2b and 3a were cloned, expressed in E. coli and purified. Protease activity was evaluated using fluorogenic depsipeptide substrates derived from the amino acid sequence at the NS4A-NS4B and NS5A-NS5B junctions. Results: The activity of the NS3 protease domains revealed no major differences among the various genotypes. For the NS3-NS4A proteins, the catalytic efficiencies of the non-genotype 1 enzymes, although higher than the ones observed for the corresponding protease domains, were similar to that observed for genotype 1 (within 3-fold). Differences in activity observed among genotypes were mainly related to changes in k,,, values. Binding constant (K,) values for BILN 2061 were similar among non-genotype 1 proteases with K,'s ranging from 80-90 nM for the NS3-NS4A proteins, up to a 60-fold reduction in affinity when compared to genotype 1. Hepatitis-C-infection (HCV) is associated with an increased incidence of the chronic fatigue syndrome and depressive mood changes. Beside immunological changes the modulation of the serotonergic system might be related to these psychiatric syndromes. Serotonin concentration, 5-HT uptake and the activity of the enzyme MAO-B in platelets are useful peripheral parameters to monitor serotonergic activity and function in patients with a chronic hepatitis C (cHC). Method In a prospective controlled study biochemical measures included assays of 5-HT concentration and 5-HT uptake activity at a low physiological substrate concentration in platelets as well as MAO-B activity of 64 patients with a chronic hepatitis C were compared to 21 age and gender-matched healthy subjects. Furthermore the effect of interferon-alpha treatment on serotonergic parameters was evaluated in 30 patients before and during treatment. Results: The mean serotonin platelet concentration did not differ between controls and HCV-infected patients. However, 5-HTuptake and the MAO-B activity were significant lower in patients with HCV-infection (p<O.OOl respectively, t-test, two-tailed). Interferon-treatment led to an increase in 53IT reuptake (P=O.Ol), to an increase of MAO-B activity (p<O.OOl) and to a decrease of serotonin concentration (p<O.Ol). Thus, during HCV-infection serotonin concentration was stabilized by a decrease in re-uptake and reduced metabolism by lowering MAO-B activity. Treatment with interferon-alpha led to a decompensation of those mechanisms by increasing the MAO-B activity and 5-HT-reuptake, followed by a decreased serotonin concentration. Conclusion: Our data support the hypothesis of a tryptophan depletion and serotonergic deficit in patients with chronic HCVinfection and interferon-alpha treatment. Furthermore the results give evidence for a useful role of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of the serotonergic deficiency during chronic HCVinfection and interferon-alpha treatment.",

            "text": "CHRONIC Background: Recent large prospective trials demonstrated that the combination therapy of interferon (1FN)-alphalribavirin significantly increased the ratio of a sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C in comparison with IFN monotherapy, especially in patients with high HCV-RNA titer and genotype lb. However, the mechanism of beneficial effect of ribavirin is still unknown. On the other hand, interleukin 18 (IL-M), originally termed IFN-y inducing factor, is one of proinflammatory cytokines, which acts on Th-1 cells and strongly induces intrahepatic NK or NKT cells as well as activated T cells to produce IFN-y. To clarify the effect of ribavirin in combination with IFN, special emphasis on IL-18, we examined the correlation between serum IL-18 level and anti-viral effect, and compared it with IFN monotherapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Patients and Methods: All patients in this study are biopsy proven chronic hepatitis C with high HCV-RNA titer (HCV-RNA>lOO kcopieslml before therapy) and serotype 1 (Genotype l a or lb). Forty-two patients were treated with IFN alpha-2b (6 MU) in combination with ribavirin (600-800 mg) daily for 2 weeks, following 22 weeks with IFN alpha-2b (6 MU) 3 times a week (the combination group). Another 40 patients who were treated with IFN alpha-2b alone between 1998 and 1999 (before introduction of ribavirin in Japan) with the same schedule are used as control (the monotherapy group). Serum samples were taken before, 2 weeks after administration and 12 weeks after cessation of therapy. Serum IL-18 are examined by enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), using human IL-18 ELISA kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The IL-18 ratio is defined as serum IL-18 level before administration divided by serum IL-18 level 2 weeks after administration. HCV-RNAs are quantitatively examined before and 2 weeks after administration. Sustained viral responses are confirmed 12 weeks after cessation of administration by RT-PCR.",

            "text": "Results: There are no differences in the background of patients between the combination group and the monotherapy group. In the combination group, the decline of HCV-RNA level highly correlates with the IL-18 ratio in patients with higher viral titer (HCV-RNA>500 kcopieslml before therapy) despite no correlation is observed in patients with lower viral titer (HCV-RNA<SOO before therapy). Similarly, the HCV-RNA level 2 weeks after administration controversially correlates with the IL-18 ratio in the higher titer group despite no correlation in the lower titer group. Interestingly, serum IL-18 level itself does not correlate with the decline of HCV-RNA level in both the higher and lower HCV-RNA titer group. On the contrary, in the monotherapy group, the level of up-regulation of serum IL-18 is lower than that of the combination group. Furthermore, although the decline of HCV-RNA also correlates with the IL-18 ratio in the higher titer group, the level of a correlation coefficient is lower than that of the combination group. However, the sustained viral clearance 12 weeks after cessation of treatment is not correlated with the IL-18 ratio. It suggests that ribavirin enhances the up-regulation of serum IL-18 level in combination with IFN therapy and the effect of ribavirin is critical for the early anti-viral response during therapy, not for sustained viral response. Objective: Treatment with pegylated interferon aLfa and ribavirin has an efficacy in chronic hepatitis C patients with sustained response rates of about 50%. However, response in genotype 1 patients with high viral load is considerably lower and is not significantly improved by pegylation of interferon. Methods: In the present study, the efficacy of CIFN daily dosing and induction therapy followed by combination with ribavirin in 200 naive patients with chronic hepatitis C and genotype 1 was evaluated. AU patients had histologically proven hepatitis, elevated ALT values and were viremic, the average weight was 80 kg. Patients were treated with CIFN dosages of 27 or 18 ug QD for 4 weeks, followed by 18 or 9 ug QD for 8 weeks. Treatment was continued with CIFN at 9 ug QD with ribavirin (7.5 or 15 mglkgld) for another 36 weeks. Results: At 48 weeks therapy an undetectable HCV-RNA was observed in 79 % and 72 % in the CIFN 27/18 and 18/9 ug groups, respectively. Data regarding sustained response rates showed 64 '10 and 58 % for CIFN 27/18 and 18/9 ug groups, respectively. Due to side effects CIFN had to be dose reduced in 11% and discontinued in 6% of patients. Addition of ribavirin potentiated the effect of consensus interferon in a dose-dependent manner as has been shown for other interferons previously. When viral response rates were related to the initial viral load, in the genotype 1 I low viral load group, SR rates of 71 and 74% were obtained for the CIFN 27/18 and 18/9 ug groups (diff. n.s.). In contrast, genotype 1 / high viral load patients showed SR rates for the CIFN 27/18 and CIFN 18/9 ug groups of 41 and 49% (diff. sig.), respectively. The viral response rates obtained with daily dosing of CIFN were significantly higher than an independently run control arm using CIFN at 9 ug TIW with ribavirin irrespective of the initial viral load. Four patients (2%) experienced grade I11 thrombocytopenias, while no grade IV neutropenias or thrombocytopenias were observed.",

However, the withdrawal rates were not sigruficantly affected by the higher dose of CIFN. Conclusions: CIFN daily dosing l induction therapy in combination with ribavirin thus shows significant response rates with the highest response rates in genotype 1 patients seen to-date. The sustained response rates for genotype 1 I high viral load patients are higher than the ones demonstrated in the PEG Interferon and ribavirin registration trials. These data suggest that for difficultto-treat genotype 1 / high viral load patients CIFN with daily and higher initial dosing may be a worthwhile alternative to standard combination therapy with pegylated interferons. Introduction: HCV-induced cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma account for at least a quarter of all patients undergoing liver transplantation. Almost 100% of HCV related liver transplant patients are re-infected with HCV after liver transplantation, often within days. In most of these cases, the recurrent infection leads to chronic hepatitis. These patients are in need of preventive therapy against re-infection of the transplanted liver.",

In addition, it may be feasible to use monoclonal antibodies in combination with other antivirals to treat chronic HCV patients. Purpose: To develop an effective therapy to prevent HCV infection in liver transplant patients. Methods: Several human monoclonal antibodies were generated from peripheral blood B cells isolated from individuals infected with HCV genotype lb. These antibodies are directed against the HCV envelope protein (E2) of the virus and have high affinity and broad reactivity against different genotypes. The antibodies were shown to neutralize HCV in vitro in a cell-based infection assay and in vivo using the HCV-Trimera mouse model. HepeX-C, a single human monoclonal antibody, was further developed and studied clinically for safety, tolerability, and potential antiviral activity in phase l a and l b clinical studies in chronic HCV patients. Results: In a phase l a study, single doses of 0.25, 1.0, 2.5, 10, and 40 mg of HepeX-C were administered to a total of 15 chronic HCV patients. These patients had varying levels of HCV-RNA (2.6 x lo3 to 1 x lo6 IUlml) and endogenous anti-E2 antibodies (5 to 550 pglml).

Results: The intent-to-treat population included 106 patients. Paired biopsies were available for 53 of the 78 AA patients and 16 of the 28 Ca patients. These patients were representative of all patients with respect to Knodell HAI scores. Mean baseline HAI activity scores were 7.2 0.32 for AA and 6.9 & 0.69 for Ca patients; mean baseline fibrosis scores were 1.8 + 0.14 and 1.9 + 0.3, respectively.

The majority of patients in both groups exhibited improvement in activity scores: 64% for the AA group and 69% for the Ca group. More importantly, the table beIow shows that the proportion of patients with worsening fibrosis was similar in both groups, while 13/53 (25%) of AA patients and only 1/ 16 (6%) of Ca patients showed fibrosis improvement.

Methods:We conducted a phase 2 pilot study to assess the safety, tolerability and viral kinetics of Mergen (12 Fg/day) by continuous infusion using a subcutaneous infusion device (Medtronic MiniMed(r) pump) in combination with ribavirin (loo0 mg or 1200 mg daily). The MiniMed model 508 micro infusion pump is cleared for use in the treatment of diabetes. HCV RNA viral levels were measured at days 1, 3,7,10,14,21,28 and then at weeks 6 and 12. Results: Among 10 nonresponders treated to date with Infergen by continuous infusion with available early viral kinetics data, 7 showed a substantial reduction in HCV viral levels (at least 1 loglo reduction in 4, and 2 loglo reduction in 3). All 7 of these patients were genotype 1 and 6 had less than 1.0 loglo decrease with prior treatment while 1 had a 1.5 loglo decrease at similar time-points with other combination therapy [either pegylated interferonlRBV (4 pts) or interferon-alfa/RBV (3 pts)]. No serious adverse events were reported and 3 patients discontinued (2 due to moderate interferon-related side effects and 1 due to inability to acclimate to the pump). Other patients continuing on study experienced mild adverse events that have been tolerable. Conclusions: Consensus interferon administered by continuous delivery via the Medtronic MiniMed pump shows early substantial reduction of HCV RNA levels among nonresponder patients and shows a good safety and tolerability profile. Updated data on a total of 22 patients (including 10 na'ive genotype 1 patients) will be presented.

            "text": "Coupling of ribavirin to hemoglobin offers the potential of a therapeutic with improved safety and efficacy by targeting the delivery of ribavirin to key tissues infected by viral infections such as HCV. These tissues include liver parenchymal cells and macrophages, both of which possess receptors for binding and internalization of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes as part of the natural clearance pathway for cell-free hemoglobin. Hemoglobin thus serves as a natural drug carrier for targeted therapy of such receptor-bearing tissues. Aim: To evaluate the effect of a ribavirinhemoelobin coniueate (RBV-Hb. HRC 203) in a mouse model of viral hepatitis induced by the coronavirus, MHV-3. Methods: Ribavirin was covalently coupled to highly purified hemoglobin HbAo at a mean molar drug ratio of 8 1 (ribavirin:hemoglobin). The RBV-Hb was evaluated for retention of haptoglobin binding and cellular uptake in vitro, as well as the ability to recover bioactive ribavirin following enzymatic cleavage from RBV-Hb. The RBV-Hb was complexed to haptoglobin prior to administration to MHV-3 infected Balblc mice, and carried one-third of the drug dose that was used for the Ribavirin group. The RBV-Hbtreated group was compared to control infected untreated and Ribavirin-treated groups for survival, clinical behavior, viral titer, biochemistry and liver histopathology. Results: RBV-Hb was specifically internalized by cultured human and mouse hepatic cells but not by control non-hepatic cells. Ribavirin enzymatically cleaved from RBV-Hb retained in vitro bioactivity similar to unmodified ribavirin. Untreated and MHV-3 infected mice all developed clinical and biochemical signs of acute viral hepatitis and died by day 4 post infection (ALTmaX 7000 IUIL). Livers recovered from untreated and infected mice showed greater than 90% necrosis. In contrast, survival was enhanced in both Ribavirin and RBV-Hb treated and MHV-3 infected mice with a marked reduction in biochemical (ALT 1000 IUIL) and histologic evidence of hepatic necrosis ( 4 0 % ) . Clinically, RBV-Hb treated mice behaved normally at all time points, in contrast to Ribavirin treated mice which developed lethargy and abnormal fur texture compatible with drug toxicity or ongoing viral infection. Conclusions: In this study, a beneficial effect of RBV-Hb was shown on the course of MHV-3 infection as demonstrated by prolonged sunival, improved clinical behavior, and a reduction in biochemical and histologic disease. The study provides a rationale for additional studies to examine the mechanism for the beneficial effect. ( Introduction: The TeraViC-4 study targets patients with chronic hepatitis C who do not show a very early viral response at week 4 of therapy, as defined by detectable serum HCV RNA (>50 KJlml, PCR methodology). After 48 weeks of therapy, these patients are expected to achieve a lower rate of sustained viral response (SVR) than patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 (VR4). Models based on viral dynamics and data from pilot studies with conventional interferon (IFN) suggest that a treatment period longer than 48 weeks may lead to a higher SVR rate in these difficult-to-treat patients. This trial compares 72 versus 48 weeks of treatment with PEGASYS(') plus COPEGUS('I in treatmentna'ive patients without VR4. Methods: This phase 111, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study is being conducted in Spain in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice.(l) After signing the informed consent form, all patients received the study treatment (peginterferon alfa-2a [40KD] [PEGASYS(']] 180 pg once weekly and ribavirin [COPEGUS(')] 800 mg daily 1400 mg bid]) for 4 weeks. At this time, viral response (VR) was assessed using the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV(') Test v2.0 (detection limit HCV RNA 50 IUlml). Patients achieving VR4 continued therapy for an additional 20-or 44-week period, according to their HCV genotype and viral load. Patients without VR4 were randomized 1:l to continue the study treatment for either an additional 44 weeks (total active treatment duration 48 weeks or an additional 68 weeks (total active treatment duration 72 weeks ). A 24-week follow-up period is ongoing to determine the SVR rate. Results: The mean age of the patients was 42 years, the mean weight was 73.5 kg, and 37% were female. The prevalence of HCV genotype 1 or 4 was 78%. VR4 occurred in 36% out of 511 patients, (23% of those with HCV genotype 1 or 4,83% of those with other HCV genotypes). HCV genotype distribution, viral load, age, and body weight were similar in the randomized study groups (Group-48 and Group-72). Among patients without VR4, HCV RNA was undetectable in 62\"h in Group-48 and in 69% in Group-72 at week 24. The biochemical response rate (BR) at week 24, defined as normal ALT levels, was similar as well: 81% in Group-48 and 78% in Group-72. The dropout rate after 24 weeks was 9% in Group-48 and 6% in Group-72. At the end of therapy (EOT), HCV RNA was undetectable in 93% of patients with VR4. The EOT VR rate in Group-48 was 74% versus 81Y0 in Group-72. The rate of BR in patients with VR at EOT was also higher in Group-72 (85%) than in Group-48 (77%). Dropout rates and reasons for dropping out by the EOT visit were different between groups: 17% in Group-48 and 36% in Group-72. Therapy was well-tolerated and no unexpected adverse events were observed. The prolongation of therapy from 48 to 72 weeks did not cause an increase in the frequency of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.",

Ripollks Background ISIS 14803 is an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In a previous Phase I study, plasma HCV RNA reductions 2 1.0 log were observed in 3 chronic HCV patients treated with ISIS 14803 for 4 weeks. Aims: The goals for this Phase I1 study were to evaluate the safety, antiviral efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ISIS 14803 given for 12 weeks. Methods: The study was conducted in noncirrhotic chronic HCV patients. Following 2 weeks of thrice weekly intravenous dosing at 2.5 mglkg ideal body weight (IBW), patients were treated for an additional 10 weeks at higher doses given either once (Group A) or twice weekly (Group B). The two doses studied were 4 (initial 3 patientslGroup) and 6 mglkg IBW. Results: Of 43 patients enrolled into the study, 41 had genotype 1 HCV, 39 had plasma HCV RNA levels 2 2 x lo6 copieslml, and all but two had previously failed interferon-based therapies. Two of the 16 Group A and 5 of the 18 Group B patients treated at 6 mglkg IBW had plasma HCV RNA reductions 2 1.0 log. Three in Group B had reductions of 3.2-3.8 log. HCV levels remained 2.5 log reduced at 110 days after the last ISIS 14803 dose in one of these patients. Seventeen patients had transient elevations in ALT including all those with HCV RNA reductions. Peak ALT levels ranged 5-30 times the upper limit of the normal range (x ULN). For those with HCV RNA reductions, the ALT flares were temporally associated with the reductions. The ALT flares were not associated with any clinical signs, symptoms, or sequelae. There were no changes in prothrombin time or albumin level. Minor alkaline phosphatase (5 2.2 x ULN) and bilirubin (5 1.5 x ULN) elevations occurred in 2 patients. Dosing with ISIS 14803 was continued during 7 ALT flares, all of which resolved to baseline levels despite continued dosing. Three flares, ranging from 9-29 x ULN, occurred 3-8 weeks after the last dose of ISIS 14803, when presumably little or no drug remained in the liver. Similar ALT elevations have not been observed in the clinical studies of other phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Aside from the ALT flares, common adverse events in this study were mild to moderate headache, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, myalgia and other flu-like symptoms. The fever and chills usually occurred several hours after the end of the 6 mglkg infusions and resolved within 24 hours. Two serious adverse events that were considered possibly related to ISIS 14803 occurred in the study: one patient had cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and one was hospitalized for precautionary monitoring of an ALTlASTlbilirubin flare. The former event was possibly due to an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. The ISIS 14803 plasma pharmacokinetics observed in this study were consistent with those seen in the previous Phase I study. Conclusions: ISIS 14803 appears to have significant antiviral activity in some chronic HCV patients. The plasma HCV RNA reductions (up to 3.8 log) achieved in this study were in difficult-to-treat patients (i.e., genotype 1, high virus level, andlor nonresponders to interferon-based therapy). Although, ALT flares were observed in some patients, the results suggest the flares may not be due to a direct hepatotoxic effect of the drug. Other than the ALT flares, ISIS 14803 treatment was generally well tolerated. This study established the dose of 6 mglkg IBW twice weekly for further clinical evaluation. A study of ISIS 14803 in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin for patients not achieving an early virologic response during standard peginterferon and ribavirin therapy is in progress. with the long serum half-life of albumin. The objectives of this phase 1/2, open-label, dose escalation study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics of Albuferon in subjects with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who had previously failed IFNa containing regimens. Methods: Subjects were initially enrolled in 4 sequential dose groups (10-12 subjects per each group at 7 pg, 20 pg, 40 pg, and 80 pg). Within each dose group a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 6 subjects per cohort were enrolled sequentially to receive 1 or 2 subcutaneous (SC) doses of Albuferon administered 14 days apart. Dose escalation beyond 80 pg included single injections of 120 pg, 180 pg, 240 p g 320 pg and 400 pg. Plasma Albuferon concentrations and antibody to Albuferon were measured by ELISA. HCV RNA was measured using the Amplicor HCV monitor kit (Roche). 2' 5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS1) mRNA levels in whole blood was measured by a research-based Taqman PCR assay. Results: Of the 63 subjects currently enrolled, 96% were infected with HCV genotype 1 with a mean baseline viral burden of 2 million copies/mL. 78% of subjects enrolled in these cohorts had previously failed pegylated IFNa containing regimens. Albuferon pharmacokinetics showed linear increases in AUCo.8 and C, , , with mean terminal half-lives of 139-158 hours with doses of 80 pg and higher. T, , , occurred between days 4 and 5. There is an approximately 40% increase in AUC after the second injection in the double injection cohort at 80 pg. Albuferon was well tolerated and there were no discontinuations. No subjects developed detectable anti-Albuferon antibodies. Adverse events were transient and most were mild to moderate. The most common adverse events were injection site erythema (39%), headache (30%), fatigue (26%), mylagia (21%) and arthralgia (19%). The mean reductions in the nadir neutrophil counts in the higher single dose cohorts ranged from 40-60%. There was induction of OASl mRNA expression in all cohorts, with approximately 9-fold increase in median values at day 7. In the single dose cohorts (=80 pg), 52% of subjects showed a maximal 0.55 log or greater reduction in HCV viral load during the first two weeks. Also, 20% or greater reductions in ALT levels were observed in 36% of subjects in these single dose cohorts. Conclusions: In the ongoing phase 112 study, Albuferon demonstrated a favorable safety and immunogenicity profile. The pharmacokinetic profile supports dosing every 2-4 wks given its reduced clearance and extended half-life of up to 158 hours. All cohorts showed evidence of biological activity, as demonstrated by OASl induction, with anti-viral activity evident in the higher single dose cohorts. Disclosures:",

We have previously shown that PFD decreased hepatic fibrosis in two different rat models of cirrhosis of Hepatology 37: [797] [798] [799] [800] [801] [802] [803] [804] [805] 2002) . Our objective in this pilot clinical study was to evaluate the safety and preliminary activity of PFD in patients with cirrhosis of varying etiologies. METHODS All patients had histologic andlor clinical evidence of cirrhosis. PFD was given orally at a dose of 400 mg TID for 12 months. Physical examination and labs including ALT, AST, bilirubin, albumin and prothrombin time, platelet count were assessed at baseline and on monthly basis. HCV RNA levels were measured in patients with chronic hepatitis C (Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor v2.0). Liver biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 12 months of treatment and were read independently by two hepatopathologists who were blinded to the biopsy sequence. Modified Histological Activity (HAI) Index of Knodell and Ishak fibrosis stage were used to assess changes in necroinflammatory scores and fibrosis stage, respectively. Change in steatosis was also assessed. RESULTS A total of 26 patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (15), ethanol (S), amyloidosis (l), autoimmune disease (1) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (1) were included. The mean age was 57 years (range, 29-75) with 13 males. Liver biopsies at end of therapy showed a 2-point or greater reduction in the HA1 necroinflammatory score in 41% of the patients. Steatosis decreased in 33% of the patients, was unchanged in 42% and worsened in 25%. While there was no significant reduction in the Ishak fibrosis stage, improvement in interstitial fibrosis was noted. Evidence of cell regeneration was seen in some patients. HCV RNA levels were measured in 15 patients with chronic hepatitis C. At 6 months, 9 patients had a decrease in viral load, 2 patients remained unchanged and 4 patients displayed an increase in viral load compared to baseline. No patient had a sustained virologic response. 4 out of 15 (27%) HCV patients had normalization of ALT, 7 out of 15 (47%) had decreased ALT values, 1 did not change (7%) and 3 patients showed a modest increase in ALT (20%). PFD was well tolerated with the predominant drugrelated adverse events being nausea, photosensitivity rash, and itching occurring in 15% of the patients and which improved after 2 to 3 months of therapy.",

CONCLUSION: Viral kinetic modeling demonstrated that the efficiency of clearance at 72 hours was significantly associated with viral clearance during treatment. Coinfection status did not affect key kinetic parameters. PEG-IFN was superior to standard interferon in terms of viral clearance efficiency, particularly in the coinfected group. Diminished SVR in coinfected patients may be related to immune factors that are operative after reduction of viral loads to undetectable levels.

However, the SVR rates are highly variable according to baseline (HCV genotype) and on-treatment parameters (initial viral decline). Thus, it must be anticipated that current standard therapy recommendations lead to under-treatment in some and over-treatment in other individual patients. Objectives: Comparison between a dynamically individualized treatment schedule according to the early virologic response versus the standard of care combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) (Pegasys @) (PEG-IFN) (180 pg qw) plus ribavirin (Copegus @) (RBV) (1000-1200 mg qd) for 48 weeks. The primary aim of the study was to increase SVR, while optimizing the available drugs, treatment duration, quality of life and the socio-economical burden of therapy. The secondary aim of the study was to enable a comprehensive analysis of virallhostlimmune correlates of response to treatment (ongoing). Methods: All patients (n=273) were initially treated with PEG-IFNlRBV for 6 weeks and initial viral kinetics were defined according to centralized serum HCV RNA quantifications (Cobas Amplicor@ HCV Monitor v2, Roche Molecular Systems) on baseline and days 0,1,4,7,8,15,22 and 29 . After classification into viral response categories at 6 weeks, patients were randomized (n=270) to individualized therapy (arms Al, A2, B1, B2, C, D) or continuation of standard therapy (STD arm). Treatment tailoring included: in rapid viral responders (RVR)discontinuation of RBV (Al) or shortening of treatment duration to 24 weeks (A2); in slow partial responders (SPR)addition of histamine (Bl) or prolongation of treatment to 72 weeks (B2); in flat partial responders (FPR)addition of histamine (C); in null responders (NUR)retreatment with high-dose of PEG-IFN (360 pg qw) plus RBV (D).

The rectally administered IFN is transferred not into blood but into regional lymphatic system and reaches to the thoracic duct via intraperitoneal lymphatics (Pharmaceut. Res. 1986; 3,116) . Therefore, the IFN suppository appears to have different antiviral mechanism from the conventional IFN injection. In this study, we performed a combination of the IFN suppository and IFN injection. The antiviral effect and immune-related markers were examined comparing with the controls (IFN injection therapy). (PATIENTS AND METHODS) Fourteen patients with chronic hepatitis C were given an IFN suppository and IFN alpha (6-10M units) injection daily for 4 weeks. After that, only IFN injection was continued three times a week for 20 weeks. The control group contains 9 patients with chronic hepatitis C, who received IFN alpha (6-10M units) injection daily for 4 weeks and were followed by the IFN injection three times a week for 20 weeks. The viral loads were 1.52-2400KIUlml (median 280KIUlml) in the IFN suppository group and 18.7-616KIUlml (median 97KIUlml) in the IFN injection group. The genotype population (lb/2a,Zb) was 5/9 and 3l6, respectively. There is no significant difference in the clinical background in the two groups. Serum HCV RNA was tested every 4 weeks. Peripheral blood NK cell activity and CD4lCD8 ratio were investigated before and 4 weeks after the beginning of the therapy. The IFN suppository contains low dose IFN alpha (BALL-1). (RESULTS) Serum HCV RNA turned negative in 73.3% of the IFN suppository group and in 66.7% of the IFN injection group (N.S.) after 4 weeks (end point of IFN suppository administration). The HCV RNA seronegative rates of the two groups were 80.0% and 77.6% (N.S.) after 24 weeks, respectively. However, while the NK cell activity was decreased in 78% of the IFN injection-treated patients after 4 weeks, only 36% of the IFN suppository patients had decreased NK cell activity (p=0.049, chi-square test). Furthermore, whereas serum ALT levels were significantly decreased after 4 weeks in the IFN injection group (83.5+47.9 IUll vs. 53.3+30.1 IUll, p=0.026, paired t test), no change was seen in the IFN suppository group (80.1IU/1+63.9 vs. 80.5+53.7, N.S.). (CON-CLUSION) The conventional IFN therapy decreased NK cell activity and serum ALT levels. However, the IFN suppository combination therapy maintained augmented NK cell activity and elevated ALT levels. These findings suggest that the IFN suppository continuously activates the hosts' immunity during IFN treatment. We used the IFN suppository only for 4 weeks; however, longer administration may lead to more frequent elimination of HCV The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of induction dose pegylated-interferon and ribavirin vs pegylatedinterferon and ribavirin as treatment strategies in relapsers to standard interferon + ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C patients.",

Liver fibrosis METAVIR score decreased in 41% of patients in non-induced group and in 19% of patients in induced group (p=0,16) whatever the response (34% in sustained responders and 25% in non responders or relapsers). CONCLUSION 1) Combination therapy with pegylated-interferon is efficient in half of relapsers to standard combination therapy. 2) The response is similar to the response observed in naive patients. 3) 8 weeks induction dose does not increase the virological response. 4) We observed a regression of liver fibrosis in 30% of patients whatever treatment regimen and virological response. BackgroundAnemia has been shown to be an important factor in impairing HRQL in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, with changes in Hb directly correlated with changes in HRQL (Gabrilove et al., J Clin Oncol2001). Since 29-36% of patients with HCV develop anemia as a side effect of combination IFNlRBV therapy (Rebetron@ Package Insert), it is important to assess the relationship between Hb and HRQL in this population. The objectives of this analysis were to (1) descriptively correlate changes in Hb to changes in HRQL in an anemic HCV-infected population; and (2) analyze the independent relationship of Hb to HRQL. Methods: HRQL scores and Hb values were obtained from clinical trial data of 185 anemic HCV-infected patients (Hb 10.8 t-0.9 gldL) who had been receiving IFNlRBV therapy for 12-14 weeks (Afdhal et al., DDW 2003) . During the 8-week double-blind phase, patients were randomized to receive either epoetin alfa 40,000 U once weekly or placebo. HRQL was measured using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), an accepted and validated tool that measures 8 domains of HRQL (Table l) , and the Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA), which measures constructs of overall quality of life, energy, and activity. Patients were categorized into the following groups based on their change in Hb levels between randomization and week 9: (1) decrease in Hb; (2) Hb increase from 0 to <2 gldL; and (3) Hb increase 2 2 gldL. Changes in HRQL (by domain of each instrument) corresponding to the aforementioned Hb categories were summarized (Table 1) . Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent impact of Hb change on HRQL improvement. The factors included in the regression model (in addition to Hb change) were: age, gender, baseline Hb, baseline HRQL domain, fibrosis status, RBV dose change, duration of HCV therapy, and HCV RNA. Results: Changes in Hb values were directly related to changes in HRQL for all 8 domains of the SF-36 and the LASA (Table 1) . HRQL changes were seen in an Hb-dependent manner; patients whose Hb increased 2 2 g/dL had higher improvements than patients whose Hb increased between 0 to <2 gldL. Similarly, patients whose Hb decreased from randomization to week 9 had mean decreases in HRQL for most of the domains (Table 1) and minimal increases for others. Regression analysis substantiated that the Hb change was a significant independent predictor (P=.006 to R.001) of HRQL change in all subscales of the LASA and the SF-36, with the exception of bodily pain and general health. Conclusions: Similar to cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, improvement in Hb is a strong independent predictor of improvement in the HRQL of HCV-infected patients. Patients on combination IFNlRBV therapy should be monitored and considered for anemia treatment to improve HRQL and potentially enhance their adherence to HCV therapy. virological response. The current trial was designed to see if better results could be achieved by retreating with higher doses of peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG2b) + weight-based ribavirin. AIM to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three different doses of PEG2b + weight-based ribavirin among interferonlribavirin non-responders. METHODS: Patients were randomized to 1 yr of treatment with PEG2b 0.5, 1.5 or 3.0 mcglkglwk, plus ribavirin 12-15 mglkglday. Treatment assignment was stratified for sex, race, HCV genotype and histologic fibrosis. Treatment was stopped at 24 wk if PCR(+). Doses were reduced by 33% for toxicity; growth factors were not allowed. RESULTS: Patients: Enrollment took place between February 2001 and November 2002, with 963 patients recruited from 100 centers; data forms have been received on 794 thus far. Enrollment was stopped in the low-dose group after FDA approval of higher doses of PEG2b. The study population is 31% female, 16% African-American, 93% genotype l, and 63% F2/3/4. Efficacy: On-treatment virological response rates were dose-related at 24 wk but less so at 48 wk (see table) . This was partly due to a higher rate of discontinuation after a satisfactory response at 24 wk on the higher dose. On-treatment response rates were lower among African-Americans and patients with more advanced fibrosis. Sustained response data will be available for most patients by October 2003. 'Tolerability: The rate of dose reduction was 33% on PEG2b 1.5 mcglkglwk, vs. 45% on 3.0. Rates of discontinuation were the same for PEG2b 1.5 and 3.0 mcglkglwk: 25% vs. 24% overall, and 13% vs. 14% for adverse events. The frequencies of subjective adverse events were similar between the two groups. Some degree of iieutropenia was observed in 27% on 1.5 mcglkglwk, vs. 32% on 3.0; however, only 14 patients in the study discontinued treatment for neutropenia overall. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Thirty to 40 percent of interferon/ OF HIGH-DOSE PEGINTERFERON ALFA-PB + RIBAVIRIN M S L D ABSTRACTS 313A ribavirin non-responders achieved initial clearance of viremia on peginterferon alfa-2b + ribavirin. 2) Doubling the PEG2b dose to 3.0 mcglkglwk resulted in a higher viral clearance rate at 24 wk but a similar rate at 48 wk. 3) The higher dose of PEG2b 3.0 mcglkglwk was well tolerated, with a higher rate of dose reduction but an identical rate of discontinuation. Beliefs about therapy and psychosocial factors may influence the course of treatment and therefore could be important for developing comprehensive medical care plans that improve treatment adherence and optimize response to therapy. Objectives: (1) To describe baseline indices of social support, depression, and self-efficacy (i.e., perceived confidence in the ability to perform health behaviors necessary for successful treatment) of patients with HCV genotype 1 participating in a treatment trial of combination peginterferon and ribavirin therapy.",

Methods: The sample consisted of the first 155 patients enrolled in the Virahep-C study, a multicenter, collaborative clinical trial, designed to examine reasons for non-response to HCV therapy in African American and Caucasian patients. Using a touch-screen computer, patients completed the 21-item Medical Outcomes Study Social Support survey (MOS-SSS); the 20-item Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD); 24 questions about self-efficacy, and the SF-36 quality of life instrument. Questionnaires were completed during an 8-week period prior to initiation of therapy. Mean scores were calculated for each of the 4 subscales of the MOS-SSS (l=supported none of the time, 5=all the time): a) tangible support (material aid, behavioral assistance); b) affectionate (expressions of lovelaffection); c) emotional-informational (expressions of understandinglencouragement); and d) social interaction (others to have an enjoyable time with). Similarly, mean scores were calculated for 5 subscales of the selfefficacy instrument (O=no confidence, 10= high): a) obtaining help; b) communicating with physicians; and managing c) symptoms, d) depression, e) medications. Correlation analysis was used to compare each subscale with the CESD and SF-36. Results: Of the participants in the analysis, 43% were African American and 33% were female. On average, perceived social support and self-efficacy beliefs were high at the initiation of treatment. Mean scores for the tangible, affectionate, emotional, and social interaction subscales were 4.2 (SD=0.9), 4.4 (SD=0.8), 4.4 (SD=0.7) and 4.2 (SD=0.8), respectively. For self-efficacy, the mean scores were 8.0 (SD=2.0) for obtaining help; 9.2 (SD=1.5) for communicating with physicians; 7.3 (SD=2.2) for managing symptoms; 8.3 (SD=1.6) for managing depression; and 9.4 (SD=1.3) for managing medications. The distribution of social support and self-efficacy scores were similar for both racial groups and genders. Depressive symptoms were common in the sample at baseline with 55% having a score of at least 16 on the CESD and 7% having a score of at least 28. In general, the social support and self-efficacy subscales were unrelated to the CESD and to the subscales of the SF-36. Conclusion: African American and Caucasian study participants rate their social support and self-efficacy beliefs high in the weeks prior to initiating combination antiviral therapy for HCV, although depressive symptoms are common. Social support and self-efficacy instruments may measure different psychosocial constructs as compared with other instruments used in HCV research like the SF-36 and CESD. As a result, social support and selfefficacy may represent new and important predictors of adherence and sustained virologic response (SVR) in HCV treatment. Baseline data from Virahep-C will be used to evaluate factors associated with adherence and SVR to determine if racial differences exist among these measures. If so, this information can be used to develop new initiatives for educating patients and families prior to initiating HCV therapy. Background and aims: Interferon(1FN) a-2blribavirin therapy is an effective anti-viral therapy for the patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1. However, the response to this therapy is not satisfactory because only about 40-50% of the patients become sustained responder(SR)s. Further, the patients receiving IFN a-2blribavirin therapy have been frequently withdrawn because of severe adverse effects. The efficacy of IFN therapy is mediated by both genomic type and viral load and to immunological response of the hosts. Reportedly, some amino acids were identified to modulate host's immunological response. In order to achieve more higher SR ratio after IFN a -2blribavirin therapy and to decrease the number of withdrawn patients, it seems important to improve the nutritional condition and to upregurate potential immunological response by modifying the balance of amino acid.",

ThllTh2 ratio at the end of therapy (24 week of the therapy) was significantly smaller than that at the beginning of the therapy (17.8210.9 vs 13.558.0, p=O.O11). However, there was no significant correlation of Thll Th2 level with the rate of HCV eradication. Total amino acids (TAAs) and branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) decreased gradually during the therapy. Even at 8week of the therapy, there was a significant decrease in TAA and BCAA (p=0.017 and p<O.OOOl, respectively). Fischer ratio (FR) also showed drastic change. It changed from 2.83 (at the beginning of the therapy) to 2.19 (at 8 week of the therapy), indicating that the balance of amino acid rapidly altered to the similar condition to the patients with liver cirrhosis. Of interest, the levels of TAA and BCAA at the beginning of the therapy were significantly higher in HCV RNA-negative group than in HCV RNA-positive group at the end of the therapy (TAA: 3243+.275 vs 28772252 nmol/ml; p=0.004, BCAA: 470292 vs 377265 nmollml; p=0.024).

Analysis of each amino acid showed that there were significant differences in the concentration of citrulline and ornithine, both amino acid are involved in urea cycle, between HCV RNA-negative and HCV RNA-positive group at the end of the therapy. Conclusions: Interferon a-Zblribavirin therapy induces malnutrition at early stage of the therapy. Successful elimination of HCV RNA seemed to depend much on nutrition rather than the ratio of Thl/Th2 during the therapy, suggesting that better response in interferon a-Zblribavirin therapy might be possible by improving the condition of nutrition at the beginning of the therapy. In addition, adequate nutrition support would contribute to the improvement of The prevalence of HCV infection in Egypt varies between 9% and 24% and approximately 90% are infected with HCV genotype 4.To date limited data exist on the effect of antiviral therapy on genotype 4-infected subjects. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of interferon (standard or pegylated) in combination with ribavirin in na'ive-to-treatment subjects with chronic hepatitis C who reside in Egypt. Methods: In a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial, 200 Egyptian subjects with chronic hepatitis C documented by liver biopsy and detectable HCV RNA in serum received interferon alfa 2b (IFN-a2b) 3 MU TIW or pegylated IFN-a 2b (100 mcglweek) in combination with weight-based oral ribavirin (800 or 1000 mg for both groups). The study design was that if HCV RNA was detectable at week 24, the treatment was stopped but if HCV RNA was undetectable at week 24, treatment was extended for a total of 48 weeks. Subjects were observed for an additional 24 weeks and HCV RNA status at week 72 determined the response to antiviral therapy. Safety laboratory tests were done at regular intervals. The study received IRB approval. The HCV RNA was done by a PCR technique with a detectability cutoff of 50-copieslmb Results: Both randomized groups were similar at baseline without statistical significant difference, 190 (90%) were infected with genotype 4, mean age was 39.5 years ? 8.7 years, 158 were men (79%), mean BMI was 27.8 2 4 kglm2, mean inflammatory HA1 score was 7/18 2 2 and fibrosis stage 2.716 t 1.3. Of the 190 genotype-4 infected individuals, 156 have finished therapy (week 48) and 78 had completed the 24week follow-up (week 72). The study will be completed by October 2003. The table shows the intention to treat rates of undetectable HCV RNA in genotype-4 infected subjects. Serious adverse events that led to discontinuation of medications were observed in 6 subjects in the standard IFNI'RBV group and in llsubjects in the PEG IFNIRBV, one death was observed in the latter group. Expected adverse events were observed in similar rates in both groups. Laboratory adverse events were observed between 2\"h and 10% of subjects receiving either treatment regimen depending on the week of therapy. No growth factors were used in this population. In summary: Subjects with chronic hepatitis C and genotype-4 infection have a similar antiviral response to standard or pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin. The safety and tolerability of the medications is similar to what has been observed for other HCV genotypes. Patients infected with HCV genotype 4 respond effectively to therapy and should be encouraged to undergo antiviral treatment. daily for 4 weeks, followed by 3 times a week for 20 weeks (week 24) and followed up for 24 weeks after cessation of therapy (week 48). The expression of SOCS-1 protein in the liver specimen obtained before the treatment was investigated by immunohistochemistry for SOCS-1. Results: Patients with the expression of SOCS-1 protein in the liver were defined as \"SOCS-1 positive group\". All other patients without staining were classified as \"SOCS-1 negative group\". Sixteen patients were SOCS-1 negative and 61 patients were SOCS-1 positive. We compared baseline characteristics among two groups. SOCS-1 positive group had a significant lower rate of SVR to IFN therapy than SOCS-1 negative group (p=0.0014). SOCS-1 positive group had significantly higher HCV-RNA titer than SOCS-1 negative group (p=0.015). We analyzed factors with IFN SVR in univariate logistic regression analysis. Not only HCV genotype (p=O.OOOl) and HCV-RNA titer (p<0.0001), but also the expression of SOCS-1 were found to be significant predictors of IFN SVR (p =0.004 BACKGROUND: Interferon(1FN) and ribavirin combination therapy is now a standard regimen for chronic hepatitis C infection and achieves a higher sustained virological response than interferon monotherapy worldwide. But the response rate to patient with genotype l b and high viral load is still not satisfactory. Some virological factors have been shown to influence the effect of interferon monotherapy in previous studies. However little is known about those influencing the outcome of combination therapy. To examine the genetic basis of the genotype l b virus resistant to combination therapy, we analyzed full-length nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of HCV RNA. METHOD: Among patients infected with genotype l b and high viral load, 6 patients treated with monotherapy : (Group A-3 nullresponders, 3 relapsers) and 10 patients treated with combination therapy: (Group B-3 nullresponders, 7 relapsers) were studied.

Despite the use of a dose of ribavirin (800 mglday) that is lower than the recommended dose for patients infected with G1 (100011200 mglday), approximately half of the patients in the study achieved an SVR. Because the study could not be blinded, a bias might have influenced the outcome of the study as suggested by the unequal discontinuation rate. These preliminary data do not support the hypothesis that higher SVR rates can be achieved in patients with HCV G l by extending treatment duration. Final data will be presented. *ITT population, defined as all patients who took at least one dose of study medication and had at least one HCV RNA evaluation postbaseline. **Safety population, defined as all patients who took at least one dose of the study medication elusive goal, particularly in previously treated patients who failed or relapsed following prior therapy.

Adverse events: Dose reduction was required in 22% of pts most commonly due to leukopenia and anemia. Permanent discontinuation of therapy was required in 8% most often due to: depression or anxiety Serious adverse events: (1.8% of pts) Included one patient each with neutropenialMRSA sepsis, optic neuritis with monocular blindness, perirectal abscess, cellulitis and multi-organ failure, cutaneous and pulmonary sarcoidosis, pneumonia, homicidal ideation, and suicide.

Patients were eligible if they had biopsy proven mild HCV (defined as necro inflammatory scores less than 4 and fibrosis scores less than 3 using the Ishak scoring system. Interferon was administered at a dose of 3 MU thrice weekly for 48 weeks regardless of viral genotype. Ribavirin was administered according to the patient's body weight ( 5 75kg 1000mg/day, > 75kg 1200mgl day in two divided doses). Randomisation was stratified according to viral genotype (1 and non-1). The primary end point was the virological outcome of treatment with sustained response defined as an undetectable HCV RNA PCR 6 months post cessation of therapy. In addition there were a number of secondary aims: 1. Viral kinetics. Serum was collected at baseline, days 3,7,10 14 and week 12 for quantitative rt PCR to determine HCV viral load. The ability of early phase kinetics and the presence or absence of a 2 log drop at week 12 to predict eventual outcome is assessed in the context of mild disease. 2. Health economics. The collection of resource use data in HCV infected patients who have mild, moderate and cirrhotic disease was performed as an integral part of this study. This data has been incorporated into a Markov chain based model to assess likely future costs of the disease and their possible avoidance by treating mild cases. Response rates from this trial will form the basis of the model. 3. Quality of life assessments. SF36 and Euroquol data were collected at baseline, weeks 1 2 2 4 and 48 during treatment and at post treatment weeks 12 and 24 in order to compare quality of life between treated patients and controls before during and after therapy.",

In an open and prospective trial we investigated, if a pre-treatment with citalopram as an SSRI can reduce the frequency of IFN-associated depression in hepatitis-C-infected psychiatric risk patients during methadone substitution. 36 patients with a chronic hepatitis C were treated with pegylated interferonalpha 2b and ribavirin according to body weight. 11 patients without any psychiatric history (group A) were compared to 25 patients during methadone substitution. The methadone substituted patients were separated into two groups: the first group (group B, n = l l ) were only treated with IFN-alpha and ribavirin and the second group (group C, n=14) received a two week pre-treatment with citalopram (20mglday) before combination treatment with IFN-alpa and ribavirin was started. Antidepressant treatment was continued over the study period of four months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD, 17-item) was used and major depression defined as >20 points. Patients were followed over the first 4 treatment months. Group differences were calculated with ANOVA for parametric and chi2-test for non-parametric scales. Results: HAMD scores at baseline were significantly higher in the psychiatric groups as compared to the controls (p=O.OlO Dallas, T X BACKGROUND: Peg plus RBV is the mainstay of chronic hepatitis C treatment. However, an upper limit in terms of safety and efficacy for dosing with Peg has not been evaluated. METHODS: We studied a group of nake patients using either conventional weight-based dosing of Peg; (1.5 pglkg) or double the dose (3.0 pglkg) plus RBV 13+2mg/kg/day for 48 weeks. Genotype 1 patients were randomized 1:l and to receive medication accordingly in unblinded fashion, with intent to enroll a total of 1,100 naYve patients N, an additional 300 previous NR or R to any type of interferon i RBV in a non randomized arm, using only the 3.0 pglkg Peg dose. Values for HCV RNA at week 12 were compared to those obtained at baseline. RESULTS: To date, 573 patients 306 N, 193 NR, 74 R have enrolled in the study. 175 patients 106 N, 48 NR, 21 R have reached week 12. HCV RNA results at week 12 are shown in the table below. Treatment was well tolerated in most patients. Dose reductions were required in 20% of N 1.5pglkg Peg and 29% of N 3.0pglkg Peg patients. Side effects were equivalent between the two groups as shown in the table below. Serious adverse events (SAE's) were less than 5% and equally observed in both arms of the N patients. None were directly attributed to study drug. There were 25 patients in the wk 12 analysis that discontinued therapy. The reasons these patients were discontinued after reaching wk 12 were side effects (36%), +HCV RNA (32%). It is interesting to note that 40% of the patients that were discontinued had 2 2 log drop or negative HCV-RNA at week 12 and a positive HCV RNA was not a reason for their discontinuation. CONCLUSION: 3.Op.glkg Peg dosing does not appear to improve 12 wk viral response, but we await 24 wk results and sustained viral response rates. Increased side effects as a result of doubling the interferon dose were not observed. More data is needed to verify the long-term efficacy and safety of this dosing regimen for patients with chronic hepatitis C . This study was supported by a grant from Integrated Therapeutics Group a subsidiary of Schering Plough. Background and Aim: One of the major adverse effects of the combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C is ribavirin-induced hemolyhc anemia. However, little is known about the mechanism of this anemia. Oxidative stress has been suggested as potentially important pathological mechanism in hepatitis C. This burden may cause peroxidation of erythrocyte membrane phospholipid in conspiracy with the accumulation of ribavirin triphosphate in the erythrocyte, which potentially attenuates the mobility of erythrocyte membrane. The aim of this study was to examine the change of fatty acid composition in erythrocyte membrane and the effects of vitamin E and vitamin C on fatty acid composition in combination therapy. Methods: Thirty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled in this prospective study. They were randomized to receive daily oral vitamin (500 mg of vitamin E plus 750 mg of vitamin C) (vitamin group) or none (control group), in addition to injections of 6 million units of interferon-a-2b daily for two weeks, followed by thrice-weekly for 24 additional weeks, plus daily oral ribavirin (600 or 800 mg) for 26 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 26 weeks after initiation of therapy. Phospholipid was separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography after extraction of total lipid from the erythrocyte ghosts.",

However there was no correlation between MxA gene expression and clinical parameters (viral load, ALT, liver histology). Patients with chronic HCV infection receiving IFN-alpha had significantly higher MxA levels than patients without treatment or healthy controls. Further we addressed the question whether MxA expression in PBMCs during therapy in previous non-responders could be a predictive marker of therapy outcome. MxA expression was clearly induced in all but one patient compared to pretreatment values (median: 10.2 fold). Importantly, the level and kinetics of MxA expression did not correlate with the response to antiviral therapy. Surprisingly, one patient showed an unusually low pre-treatment level of MxA expression and a total lack of MxA induction during IFN therapy, which was associated with complete non-response to therapy. In a neutralization assay, we could detect neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha2b in the serum of this patient whereas no neutralizing antibodies were found in all others patients.

Phase 1/11 studies confirmed the ALT lowering effect of glycyrrhizin therapy in western patients with chronic hepatitis C. The treatment duration in these studies was limited to 4 weeks. ALT response was lost during follow-up. AIM 1) To evaluate which dose frequency is required beyond week 4 to maintain the initial ALT response. 2) To evaluate the effect of SNMC treatment on liver histology. METHODS: HCV-RNA positive patients with ALT >2x ULN, fibrosis stage 2 3 or necro-inflammation score 2 6 (Ishak's score) who were not eligible for interferon therapy (prior non response, absolute contraindications) could enter this multi-center, randomized, open phase I1 clinical trial. All patients were treated 4 weeks with six infusions weekly of 100 ml SNMC (Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Japan) containing 200 mg glycyrrhizin. Patients with an ALT response at week 4 (defined by a decrease of more than 50 percent of the baseline value or ALT 51.5 ULN) were randomized to continue treatment in three dose frequency groups for a total of 26 weeks. SNMC was given 6 times weekly (group l), Objectives: It is important to maintain reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in cases with chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) that do not respond to interferon (IFN) and in those with no indication of IFN therapy. We reported previously that dietary restriction of iron intake reduces serum ALT levels in such patients. We evaluated CH-C patients treated with iron-restricted diet for two or more consecutive years, mainly focusing on the balance of energy intake, physical examination, and changes in hematological indices of nutrition. Methods: Twenty-two patients with CH-C (males, 18; females, 4; mean age, 56 year-old) that consulted our outpatient department were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) elevation of ALT levels above the upper normal limit for 3 months or more; 2) positive tests for HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA; 3) absence of other causes of CH (alcoholic liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, hemochromatosis) and negativity for hepatitis B surface antigen and for serum anti-nuclear and anti-mitochondria1 autoantibodies. Twenty cases had received IFN therapy for more than 12 months before the beginning of the study; none of them responded to IFN therapy. Dietary prescriptions included iron intake 7 mglday or less, energy intake 30 kcallkglday, protein intake 1.1-1.2 glkglday, and a fat energy fraction of 20%. Nutritional balance was evaluated based on meal records, and instructions was given when necessary. Results: The average energy intake before dietary prescription was 2184 kcal(36.7 kcallkg)lday, and it was significantly reduced to 1655 kcal(28.5 kca1lkg)lday (p < Om), and then maintained stable at 30 kcallkglday. The average protein intake before dietary prescription was 85.7 g (1.45 glkg)lday and it was reduced to 1.1-1.2 glkglday after the prescription. The average fat intake of 66.5 g (1.1 glkg)lday and the average fat energy fraction of 27% before the dietary prescription were significantly decreased to 30.8 g (0.52 glkg)lday; p < 0.01 and 16% (p < 0.001), respectively, after dietary instructions. The fat energy fraction was maintained at a level of 20% or less. Carbohydrate intake did not change remarkably during the observation period, although the carbohydrate energy fraction significantly (p < 0.001) increased. The average iron intake decreased significantly (p < 0.001) from 9.6 (before) to 6.1,5.2, 5.1,5.2, and 5.1 mglday 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after die* prescription, respectively. Body mass index (Bh4I) before diet prescription was 23.9 on average; BMI had no significant change throughout the course. The body fat percentage was 24.6% on average before the diet instructions, and it significantly decreased after the diet. The average values of aspartate aminotransferase and ALT before diet prescription were 65 IUll and 66 lull, respectively, and they were significantly reduced to 48",

The use of high dose Pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin led to a significant drop out rate in comparison to the low dose pegylated interferon. Background During liver injury, poorly characterized factors activate quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) to become proliferative, matrix-synthesizing myofibroblasts. Activated HSC are the major source of liver collagen and thus, play a key role in the fibrotic response to liver injury.The SNS appears to promote fibrosis in injured livers because hepatic fibrosis is increased in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, which has an overactive SNS. Conversely, prazosin, an adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibits fibrosis in toxin-damaged rat livers. HSC express several neuronal proteins, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). They also contain synaptic vesicles and receive autonomic fibers. Therefore, our HYPOTHESIS is that HSC are hepatic neuroglial cells that produce and respond to neurotransmitters in order to become activated during liver injury. Methods: HSC were isolated from normal mice and Dbh-lmice that cannot produce norepinephrine (NE) due to targeted disruption of the dopamine P-hydroxylase (Dbh) gene. Lysates of culture-activated HSC were analysed by RT-PCR, immunoblot and HPLC to determine if they express adrenoceptors, catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes andlor produce NE. The effect of adrenoceptor antagonists and NE on HSC growth in vitro was also assessed. Then in vivo activation of HSC by hepatotoxic diets was evaluated in control and Dbh-lmice by comparing numbers of a-smooth muscle actin (ASMA)+ cells with immunohistochemistry and the induction of TGFP-1 and collagen a-1 gene expression by ribonuclease protection analysis of whole liver RNA. Results: HSC express a-and P-adrenoceptors, tyrosine hydroxylase and Dbh. HSC from control, but not Dbh-I-, mice release NE. Endogenous NE is an autocrine growth factor for HSC because a-and P-adrenoceptor antagonists inhibit proliferation of HSC cultured from control mice. Moreover, HSC from Dbh-lmice, which cannot make NE, grow poorly in culture and are rescued by addition of NE. Exogenous NE also promotes HSC proliferation. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that the latter effect is mediated via G-protein coupled adrenoceptors that activate mitogen activated kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathways. HSC activation in response to diet-induced liver injury is inhibited in Dbh-Imice, as evidenced by reduced hepatic accumulation of ASMA (+) HSC and inhibited hepatic induction of Background & Aims: Hepatic cirrhosis is six times more prevalent in obese individuals than in the general population, and obesity is one of the risk factors for liver fibrosis in which plasma adiponectin levels are decreased. Adiponectin is an adipocytokine, which we previously identified by screening adipose-specific genes in the human cDNA project. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play central roles in liver fibrosis. When they are activated, they undergo transformation to myofibroblast-like cells, then proliferate, migrate, produce transforming growth factor-pl (TGF-Pl), and various extracellular matrix proteins, and express a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA). We previously reported that adiponectin suppresses not only the proliferation and migration of HSCs, but also the TGF-pl-induced fibrogenic gene expression in HSCs. Adiponectin could have biological significances in liver fibrosis. In this study, in order to clarify the effect of adiponectin on liver fibrosis in vivo, we tested the role of adiponectin on liver fibrosis using adiponectin-knockout (KO) mice and adenovirus mediated adiponectin expression system. Methods: (1) To investigate the anti-fibrogenic effects of physiological concentrations of adiponectin, male wild type (WT) mice and KO mice were used. Mice were each injected with a dose of carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4) (300 pllkglbw) intraperitoneally twice a week for 12 weeks to induce liver fibrosis.",

Moreover, in Gr.4, the hydroxyproline content was significantly decreased compared to that in 6-weeks of C C 4 treatment even though CCl, was given for an additional 6-weeks (total 12 weeks). Conclusions: The findings indicate that adiponectin attenuates liver fibrosis and could be a novel approach in its prevention. Disclosures: (tTG) is observed in mature scars and might promote wound repair by protecting the neomatrix from degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).However, such ECM crosslinking has the potential to hinder the matrix remodelling required for resolution of liver fibrosis. We have explored this hypothesis by examining expression of tTG and its crosslink product epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine in livers of: a) rats administered CC14 for 6 weeks (6wk C C 4 cohort)after which liver fibrosis resolves spontaneously after 28 days; b) rats administered CC14 for 12 weeks (12wk CC14 cohort) which develop micronodular cirrhosis; c) 12 wk CCl4 treated rats allowed to recover for 365 days after last CC14 dose (12 wk+365d cohort) which show partial resolution of fibrosis but with persistence of a macronodular cirrhosis. Although tTG was identified by immunohistochemistry within and around fibrotic bands in 6 wk CCld cohort, no crosslinks were detectable. However, both tTG and crosslinks were detected in and around mature fibrotic bands in the 12wk CC14 cohort and in persisting fibrotic bands in the 12wk+365d cohort. Western blotting of liver homogenates from these two cohorts using antibody against the crosslink revealed a major product of 160 kD which was degradable to lower molecular weight products following incubation of homogenates with bacterial collagenase but was refractory to MMP-2. To evaluate if ECM crosslinking in livers correlated with its resistance to MMPs, 10 micron cryostat sections of livers from the three cohorts were incubated with purified active forms of MMP-1 or MMP-2 for 8 hr at 37 C and any residual ECM was stained with Sirius red. ECM of 6 wk CC14 cohort was effectively degraded by these MMPs but that of 12wk C C 4 and 12 wk+365d cohorts was only minimally degraded. HSC freshly isolated from normal rat or human liver showed no tTG expression whilst HSC activated for 7-15 days on plastic substrate expressed tTG protein (by Western blotting) and mRNA (by RT-PCR). There was tTG in cell lysates and in conditioned media of activated HSC. Pure rat tail type I collagen incubated with conditioned media of activated HSC incorporated crosslink antigen, confirming that HSC secreted functional enzyme. However, no crosslink was found in type I collagen incubated with media from HSC which had tTG gene silenced by cell transfection with small inhibitory RNA. Cultured HSC which had tTG gene silenced had enhanced apoptosis (by acridine orange staining) following serum deprivation in culture. This suggests tTG or tTG activity promotes survival of these cells. We conclude that in persistent, incompletely resolving liver fibrosis there is evidence of tTG mediated crosslinking of the liver ECM and resistance to exogenous MMPs. Both features are lacking in ECM of fully resolving fibrosis. ECM crosslinking by tTG might limit resolution of cirrhosis. Activated HSC are a potential source of tTG following liver injury and, as this protein supports their survival, it might contribute to their persistence in cirrhotic liver. We recently defined multifunctional biochemical properties of the Long and Frizzled variants and hypothesized that they may be inherent in the 192-aa-Long-specific and the 235-aa-FZ-specific modules, respectively. We thus transfected pCDNAS.l-V5-His vectors containing variant-specific sequencer3 in mhAT3FlS315 hepatoma cells. This cell line stably expresses a truncated HNF3 protein turning off endogenous expression of liver-specific genes, such as albumin or C18. Consistently, mhAT3FlS315 hepatoma cells transfected with an empty vector showed no endogenous C18 expression. By immunohistochemistry, using variant-specific and tag-specific antibodies and after analysis by confocal microscopy, Long was localized in large supranuclear vacuolae suggesting protein storage/maturation in Golgi structures or in beaded perinuclear vacuolae suggesting RER cysternae. In contrast, FZ was strongly detected in close proximity to the plasma membrane of single cells. Clusters of FZ-transfected cells showed a strong and dense signal at sites of cell-cell contact, outlining single cells. These findings were confirmed by transfection of prep-7 vectors containing full-length Long or FZ forms of human C18 and confocal microscopy analysis after immunohistochemistry using an antibody directed against an epitope common to all C18 forms. Immunoblot analysis of conditioned media showed that the fulllength Long form was secreted into the medium but not FZ. The latter was detected as a heavily glycosylated protein (> 300 kD) in the cell layers, predominantly in the triton-X-100 insoluble pellet after sonication and 10% SDS solubilization, suggesting binding to extracellular matrix proteins. Finally, glycosydase analysis of FZ and Long N-terminal modules showed an important increase in mobility after PNGase F plus sialidase A digestion. These data show that, in addition to the previously described plasma (Long) and tissue (Short) forms of Cl8, the FZ form constitutes the pericellular matrix form, suggesting that the specific modules of C18 regulate tissue targetting through protein-protein interactions. Backgr0und:During liver fibrosis, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) acquire an activated phenotype, proliferate and produce an excess of collagens. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a known immunosuppressive drug. which inhibits the proliferation of B-and T-lymphocytes by Inosine Mono Phosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition, causing an intracellular guanosine depletion. In addition, MPA has shown to inhibit growth of mesangium cells in the kidney and of skin-and tenon fibroblasts. Therefore, we hypothesize that the proliferation of HSC may also be influenced by MPA. In this study we explored whether MPA is able to inhibit the proliferation of primary isolated rat HSC in vitro. Furthermore, we studied the in vitro effects, mechanism of cellular uptake, and in vivo pharmacokinetics of MPA coupled to mannose-6-phosphate modified human serum albumin (M6P-HSA). M6P-HSA is a newly developed, HSC-specific drug carrier, homing towards the upregulated M6PlIGF-I1 receptor on activated HSC. In this way we hope to achieve cell-specific delivery of MPA to the HSC avoiding undesired effects of MPA on the immune system. Meth-odslResults: In primary cultures of HSC a dose dependent reduction in the number of BrdU-positive nuclei was observed after 24h incubation with 750,3000 and 6000 nM MPA, as assessed immunohistochemically. Coupling of MPA to M6P-HSA via a biodegradable ester linker resulted in a conjugate with a maximum drug: carrier ratio of 1.2:l. Analysis of the synthesized constructs was performed by HPLC, FPLC and MS. This conjugate was able to inhibit 3T3-fibroblast growth, as detemined by BrdU-incorporation (ELISA) in a dose dependent manner, reducing proliferation to 38.0 2 14.5%, 30.0 t 18.0% and 18.0 2 16.8% of control at 120, 240 and 480 uglml of conjugate, respectively. When cells were co-incubated with an excess of M6P-HSA, a competitor for receptor mediated uptake of the conjugate, the anti-proliferative effect was reduced by 69 YO. The organ distribution of the conjugate, 1251 labeled, was evaluated by IV injection of a tracer dose in rats 3 weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL-3). 47.3 t-4.1 % of the injected dose accumulated in the liver after 10 min of injection. In contrast, spleen and thymic gland accumulated 1.47 f 2.65% of the injected dose. Intra-hepatic distribution was assessed in BDL-3 rats by immuno-histochemical double staining for HSA and specific markers for Kupffer cells (ED-2), HSC (DesminelGFAP) or Endothelial cells (HIS52). M6P-HSA-MPA showed a non-parenchymal distribution and co-localization with HSC and Kupffer cells. Conclusions: MPA is able to inhibit the proliferation of primary isolated rat HSC. This suggests that stellate cells are dependent on intracellular IMPDH activity to proliferate. Coupling of MPA to MCiP-HSA, a stellate cell specific drug carrier, resulted in a pharmacologically active construct, able to inhibit fibroblast proliferation in vitro after specific uptake via the M6P/IGF-II receptor. The major part of the injected conjugate accumulates in the HSC and Kupffer cells of the liver, and avoiding uptake in the major resident organs for Band T-lymphocytes. Future studies will assess the advantage of this first HSC-selective compound in animals with liver fibrosis. Background: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is the most potent stimulator of migration and proliferation of mesenchymal cells. The expression of PDGF-p-receptor is increased during liver fibrosis. Our aim was to investigate the effect of p3-integrin subunit blockade using the specific non-peptidic inhibitor EMD409915 on migration and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF). Materials and methods: Cell migration of human HSC and HFF was assessed using a scratch assay. Scratches of 600-700 pm width were made in confluent cell monolayers of cells following 24 h starvation in serum-free medium. After wounding. cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB (10 nglml) with or without EMD409915 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at increasing concentrations (10-10M -10-6M). Cell proliferation was measured as DNA synthesis by BrdU-incorporation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK112, p38, SAPKlJNK and Akt) phosphorylation was evaluated by phospho-MAPK-specific Western blotting of cell lysates after 10 min of stimulation. Results: Stimulation of human HSC cells with PDGF-BB at 10 nglml in the absence of other growth factors resulted in pronounced stimulation of cell migration. PDGF-stimulated migration of human HSC was inhibited dose-dependently between 10-9 and 10-6 M by EMD409915, with complete abrogation of migration at 10-6M. Surprisingly, human skin fibroblast migration was not affected by b3-blockage. There was no effect of p3 integrin inhibition on cell proliferation as measured by BrdU-incorporation, neither in human HSC-nor in HFF cells. Pre-incubation of HSC cells with the p3 integrin inhibitor at 10-6M did not affect the activation of p38 MAPK, p44l42 MAPK or SAPKlJNK. Conclusions: 1. PDGF-BBinduced migration is strongly b3integrin dependent in human HSC, but not in human skin fibroblasts. 2. In contrast to cell migration, HSC and HFF proliferation is p3-integrin-independent. 3. p38, p44l42, SAPKlJNK and AKT mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways are not modified by p3-integrin inhibition. 4. p3-integrin antagonist may be an adjuvant approach to treat hepatic fibrosis.

            "text": "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is defined as a process, in which epithelial cells loose their epithelial characteristics and acquire typical characteristics of fibroblasts. Epithelial cells are tightly attached to their neighboring cells via cell adhesion molecules and they adhere with their basal side to their underlying basement membrane matrices, whereas the apical side faces a lumen. In contrast to immobile epithelium, mesenchymal fibroblasts are specifically designed to invade extracellular matrix (ECM). This is reflected by their prominent mesenchymal cytoskeleton and by their lack of a typical polarity. In the adult organism, EMT occurs in epithelia in response to injury, potentially as a means to replenish fibroblasts, which are required for repair of injury. In organ fibrosis however, enhanced conversion of epithelium into fibroblasts is considered to contribute to progression of disease, as parenchymal epithelial cells acquire phenotypic and functional properties of activated fibroblasts. Recent studies provided increasing evidence that parenchymal epithelium can potentially contribute to activated fibroblasts by EMT, as in mouse models of kidney fibrosis 36% of activated fibroblasts were found to be of tubular epithelium origin. In liver fibrosis, stellate cells are considered the principal source of activated fibroblasts, whereas the role of hepatocytes is considered minor, even though they constitute for more than 80% of the liver mass. Here we provide evidence that the pro-fibrotic growth factors TGF-beta1 and EGF induce expression of fibroblast-markers fibroblast specific protein-1 (FSPl), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and type I collagen in primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 and EGF induce acquisition of fibroblast characteristics, migratory capacity and release of MMP-2, suggesting EMT of hepatocytes in vitro. Additionally, progression of liver fibrosis in a mouse model of tetracarbon chloride-induced liver disease is associated with appearance of FSPl positive hepatocytes, indicating EMT, which suggests a role of EMT in liver fibrosis. In conclusion, our results for the first time provide evidence for an active role of hepatocytes in liver fibrosis by undergoing EMT. Human Studies -Serum MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated in both CFLD (929t67 pglml; p<O.OOOl) and BA (1,2902220 pglml; p<O.OOOl) vs controls (602240 pglml). In CELD subjects serum MCP-1 was negatively correlated with the stage of fibrosis (r= Conclusion: These results provide strong evidence for a role for MCP-1 in early fibrogenic events in cholestatic liver injury, ie., ductular proliferation and procollagen q(I) mRNA expression, and suggest that serum MCP-1 may be a very good marker of the onset of cholestatic liver disease. This is the first study to clearly demonstrate elevated excretion of MCP-1 into bile in obstructive cholestasis, implying a potential role for MCP-1 in HSC and inflammatory cell recruitment to the biliary tree in cholestatic liver injury. [Background and Aim] Angiotensin I1 (Ang 11) is considered to play an important role in hepatic fibrogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of renin-angiotensin system in hepatic fibrogenesis has not been clarified. We previously reported that Ang I1 up-regulated mRNA expression of pro a (I) collagen and TGF-p in isolated rat hepatic stellate cells and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, reduced carbontetrachroride-induced rat hepatic fibrosis.

Recently, the RholRho-kinase has been demonstrated to be involved in the signal transduction pathway of the Ang I1 type I receptor signaling downstream. Thus,the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of RholRho-kinase pathway in hepatic fibrogenesis in rat. To that effect, a rat hepatic fibrosis model was produced by chronic administration with cholinedeficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet and the effect of an ARB and a Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y27632) in this model was investigated. Methods: Wistar rats (male, 6 weeks-old) were continuously fed the CDAA diet or the control choline supplemented, L-amino-defined (CSAA) diet. The rats were treated with 1 mglkg candesartan cilexetil, an ARB (a kind gift by Takeda Chemical Induustries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), or 1 mglkg Y27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor (a generous gift by Mitsubishi Welpharma Co., Tokyo, Japan), once daily through stomach tube. Twelve weeks after the start of administration, the liver was excised and subjected to histological examination for fatty change and fibrosis by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels were also measured. Since CDAA diet causes hepatic steatosis and fibrosis via production of free radicals, we also studied the oxidative membrane damage by immunostaining of 4-hydroxynoneal (HNE) adduct. Results: Histologic examinations showed severe steatosis and fibrosis in the liver of CDAA-fed rats and no significant change in CSAA-fed rats. The liver weight of CDAA-fed rats was significantly increased than that of CSAA-fed rats. Both candesartan cilexetil and Y27632 remarkably reduced not only fibrosis, but also severe steatosis and the liver weight of the treated rats was significantly reduced in both treated groups. Serum HA levels but not ALT values significantly elevated in CDAA-fed rats compared to CSAA diet fed group. The increased levels of serum HA were significantly reduced by the treatment with candesartan cilexetil or Y27632. The number of HNE-positive hepatocytes increased by CDAA diet and this increase was attenuated in the candesartan cilexetil-or Y27632-treated groups. Conclusion: These results suggests that an ARB, candesartan cilexetil, and a Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y27632, show the same inhibitory effect on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis induced by chronic CDAA diet, and this free radicalinduced hepatic injury is a good therapeutic target of ARBS or Rho-kinase inhibitors. The RholRho-kinase may be a key enzyme system in the Ang I1 signaling involved in the hepatic fibrosis. In liver cirrhosis, malnutrion and portal congestive enteropathy facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to mesenteric lymph nodes and the development of endotoxemia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in ascitic patients. IGF-I is an anabolic hormone synthesized in the liver, whose levels are reduced in hepatic Cirrhosis. IGF-I possesses hepatoprotective properties and displays trophic effects on the intestine. Here we investigated whether IGF-I therapy could in-fluence portal pressure and bacterial translocation in experimental cirrhosis. Methods: Liver cirrhosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats (n=30) by oral administration of carbon tetrachloride during 8 weeks. After this time, rats were randomized in two groups to receive subcutaneous injection of recombinant human IGF-I (2 microgllO0 g body weight in two separated doses per day) (CI-IGF, n=15) or vehicle (CI, n=15), for 21 days. Eight healthy rats, receiving vehicle were studied in parallel. At the end of treatment period, animals underwent laparotomy to measure portal pressure and to collect blood and tissue samples. Endotoxin quantification in blood samples was carried out with a colorimetric Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test. Liver and ileum histopathological changes were assessed in tissue sections stained with Masson's trichrome, using a numerical scoring system. Bacterial translocation was evaluated by culturing blood samples and mesenteric lymph nodes in appropriated culture media. Results: Treatment with IGF-I significantly improved biochemical markers of liver damage, being the ALT values significantly lower in the CI-IGF group than in CI rats (p<0.05). In addition we found that IGF-I administration to cirrhotic rats reduced both the hepatic histopathological score ( The rate of progression to cirrhosis varies among individuals infected with hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) is a plasma glycoprotein involved in lipid metabolism which transfers cholesterol esters from HDL to VLDL and LDL. Obesity and steatosis are emerging as key factors in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in HCV. Variability in function or levels of CETP may affect lipid transport and therefore steatosis. The uncommon VallVal genotype results in decreased CETP plasma activity and may protect against myocardial infarction.",

However, little is known about exact mechanism of fibrogenesis by specific HCV gene or protein because the study of HCV-induced liver fibrosis has been mainly studied in human or animal model. Moreover, the dynamically molecular study of HCV role in relation to liver fibrogenesis or immune response has been hampered due to lack of efficient in vitro HCV culture system. In the present study, we investigated whether HCV core protein directly influence on the liver fibrogenesis through stimulation of hepatic stellate cell(HSC) in in vitro or not. Methods Human and rat HSCs were isolated using collagenase perfusion system and density gradient method, and other human HSC line (L190) was purchased from ATCC. We established co-culture system of primary HSC and HepG2-core stable cell line which HCV-core gene was transfected into HepG2 cell. Co-culture system was divided into two way, mixed co-culture and separated co-culture system. Immunocytochemical staining was performed to identify the cytokines such as transfoming growth factor pl (TGF-P1) and a-smooth muscle actin(a-SMA) overexpressed from HSC in the liver fibrogenesis. a-SMA, TGFpl, transforming growth factorp receptor I1 (TGFORII), collagen type I were also quantitated by Western blot analysis.

Further study is needed to clarify exact signal transduction of fibrogenesis by HCV core protein in the co-culture system. Background: To current knowledge, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling is mandatory to produce liver fibrosis. Various molecular interventions designed to affect the TGF-beta system were successfully used to inhibit fibrogenesis. Activated hepatic stellate cells have been considered as a major producer of extracellular matrix proteins in liver injury and fibrosis. In the present study, we wondered whether follistatin, activin inhibitory protein, reduce apoptosis and prevent liver fibrosis and whether activin plays a key role in liver fibrogenesis. Methods: Wistar male rats weighing around 380g were injected intraperitoneally with dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) (lOpg/g body weight) three times a week for three weeks. Either follistatin or saline were also injected intravenously three times a week. On the 22nd day, blood was collected and biochemical parameters were measured using the standard methods. The liver was either fixed with 4% bufferedparaformaldehyde for histological examination, or frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for the RNA analysis. Tissue sections were either stained with Hematoxyline-eosin, Masson-trichrome, or subjected to immunohistostaining using antibodies against collagen type IV, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), fibronectin, TGF-beta. The mRNA expression of activin, TGF-beta, TIMP were measured by RT-PCR. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL methods. Wistar male rats were injected with DMN (10kglg body weight) once and liver tissues were obtained and fixed with 4% buffered-paraformaldehyde 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 hours and 7 days after injection for immunohistochemical staining. Hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion method and by collagenase-pronase perfusion method and analyzed activin and TGF-beta mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Results: 50% of control rats died, whereas none of follistatintreated rats died within 22 days. The serum level of hyaluronic acid in follistatin-treated rats were significantly reduced. AST and ALP levels were also decreased significantly. Apoptosis was reduced by follistatin dose-dependently. The expression of TGFbeta, TIMP, Collagen lV and alpha-SMA expression were also decreased in follistatin treated rats. We then examined activin expression in liver after DMN treatment. Activin expression was observed at the maximum level in hepatocytes 12 hours after DMN treatment. TGF-beta expression was not detectable 12 hours after DMN administration, and it was sfxikingly increased in stellate cells 48 hours after DMN administration but it was not detectable in hepatocytes. Activin appeared in hepatic stellate cells as well as in hepatocytes 72 hours after Dh4N administration. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been reported to play pivotal roles in the development of various types of liver injury and iNOS expression may be important in the process of fibrogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in obesity. NO-induced active substance was shown to activate matrix metalloproteinase. The iNOS mRNA and protein activity have been found to be induce in rats on a high-fat diet. Objectives We investigated whether 1) induction of NOS occurs in liver of mice fed high-fat diet, and 2) NOS increases matrix metalloproteinase activity and reduces collagen content, thus attenuates liver fibrosis.",

Of the remaining BDL/Mn+2-cirrhotic animals (n=10), 5 were injected with Ad-huPA plus Ad-MMP-8 (3x10\" + 1.5~10~' vp/kg respectively) and 5 rats injected with (4.5~10\" vp/kg of Ad-P-Gal). This treatment lasted 10 days. Then, biological samples were recollected as before. An additional experimental model represented by cirrhotic rats injured chronically for 7 weeks with CClb were also monitored for their response to this therapy. RESULTS Seven wk-CC4-cirrhotic animals treated with Ad-huPA plus Ad-MMP-8 (total 4.5x101'vp/kg) were monitored at 2,4,6,8, 10 and 12 days after combined gene therapy treatment (n=18). These animals showed improvement in liver fibrosis of up to 55% as compared with their Ad-P-Gal (n=18) treated cirrhotic counterparts. These results correlated with hydroxyproline detemiinations. Furthermore, survival was determinated in 28 additional cirrhotic animals. 14 cirrhotic rats treated with Ad-huPA plus Ad-MMP-8 had a significantly higher probability of survival at 60 days after beginning of treatment as compared with 14 Ad-@-Gal cirrhotic rats.",

            "text": "BDL/Mn+2 injured rats displayed tremors, rigidity, and gait abnormalities. Ten days after treatment with combined therapeutic gene therapy, these symptoms decreased. Also, liver fibrosis was evidently less (25%) as compared with Ad-P-Gal treatment rats. Brain tissue (striatum) was recollected 10 days after BDL/Mnf2 animals were injected with either Ad-huPA plus Ad-MMP-8 or Ad-p-Gal alone. Dopamine (3.04 mglgr) was decreased in 30% in Ad-P-Gal treated animals, as compared with 4.79 mglgr of Dopamine found in Ad-huPA plus Ad-MMP-%treated animals. Dyhydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC a main dopamine metabolite) was as high as in Ad-huPA plus Ad-MMP-%treated animals (13.56 mglgr striatum) indicating a higher dopamine turnover in nontherapeutically treated cirrhotic animals. Moreover, animals treated with Ad-huPA+Ad-MMP-8 showed a 50% decrease in ascitis and gastric varices as compared with Ad-P-Gal-treated animals. (Gastroenterology 1221924,2002) . While PPAR-a was reported to be involved in induction of antioxidant enzymes expression and activities (Life Sci 63:135,1998). Furthermore, in respect of hepatic fibrosis, oxidative stress induces hepatic fibrosis and many reports have demonstrated that several antioxidants can inhibit hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether PPAR-a ligands, i.e. Wy-14,643 and fenofibrates, can suppress hepatic fibrosis by attenuating oxidative stress in experimental rat model and possess a possibility of therapeutic candidate for hepatic fibrosis. Methods: Fibrosis was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of thioacetamide (TAA) (200 mglKg twice weekly for 6 weeks). In the treated groups, PPAR-a ligands, Wy-14,643 (Wy) and fenofibrates, were fed a diet containing 0.1% (wlw), and PPAR-y ligands, pioglitazone (PIO), were fed containing 0.01% (wlw) all through the experiment. Control cirrhotic rats received saline injections for 6 weeks. After killing all rats, histological examinations (HE, Azan staining, immunohistochemistry of a-SMA), serum value of ALT and hyaluronic acid, mRNA expression of PPARs, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), a1 (I) procollagen, and antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. We also determined lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione levels, and activities of SOD and catalase in the perfused liver. Results: Semi-quantitative analyses of fibrotic area revealed that Wy co-administration with TAA reduced to only 19% of the area of TAA-treated rats. There was no significant difference in Azan staining of the liver between TAAtreated rats and TAA-treated rats. Wy administration could not lower serum ALT value in chronic and acute TAA injury. These observations suggest that Wy fails to modulate the hepatotoxicity of TAA. An increased expression of PPAR-CY in TAAtreated rats were observed, but the expression of PPAR-a was abolished in TAA-and TAA-treated rats. Wy intensively enhanced mRNA levels of ACO which was regulated by PPAR-a, increase nearly 50-fold than controls, but the expression of ACO diminished in TAA-and TAA-PPAR-A ACTIVATORS, WY-14,643 AND FENOFIBRATES, treated rats as well as PPAR-a. The mRNA levels of a1 (I) procollagen and TGF-/3l were strongly increased in TAA-and TAA-administrated rats than in controls, while they were dramatically suppressed in TAA-treated rats. The catalase mRNA was reduced to 15% of the controls in TAA-and TAA-treated rats, however, TAAtreatment prevented this decrease to 70% of the control levels. Catalase activity increased 2-fold in TAAtreated rats than in controls, while it decreased 60% of the controls in TAA-and TAA-treated rats. In TAA-and TAA-treated rats an increase of LPO was observed, but not in TA-Atreated rats. We c o n h e d that fenofibrates treatment could reduce hepatic fibrosis to approximately 16% of TAA treatment for 6 weeks by semi-quantitative analysis of fibrotic area. Conclusion: Our data indicate that WAR-a activators, not PPAR-y, can markedly inhibit hepatic fibrosis in the experimental TAA-induced rat cirrhotic model. We suggest that PPAR-a and catalase are important in the development of hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, we conclude that suppression of hepatic fibrosis by PPAR-a activators is probably due to their antioxidant effects via increased activitiy of catalase which reduces hydrogen peroxide, and that fibrates, such as fenofibrates and bezafibrates, might be new candidates for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. Fibrosis is a common end-point in clinical trials of chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for fibrosis evaluation. However, variability in fibrosis distribution within the liver (sampling variability) is a potential limit to liver biopsy. In order to assess the influence of sampling variability on the accuracy of liver fibrosis assessment with biopsy, we measured liver fibrosis on virtual biopsies of increasing length reconstituted from digitalized images of large liver sections using two different methods of fibrosis assessment. Method Large sections (3cmZ) were performed from 17 surgical liver samples with chronic hepatitis C and various degree of fibrosis. Measurement of fibrosis on the whole section was considered as the reference value. From the digitalized image of the whole section, virtual biopsies of increasing length (2.5 to 200mm) were reconstituted. Fibrosis was assessed independently on each individual virtual biopsy using both image analysis and META-VIR score. Results were compared to the reference value. Results: A total of 10.659 virtual biopsies were studied. Using image analysis, a strong dispersion of area of fibrosis was observed for virtual biopsies smaller than 4Omm. Only 22% of 1,5 mm length virtual biopsies had a measured of area of fibrosis equal to reference value 2 10%.",

It increases to 75% for a 2,5 cm size without any substantial benefit for longer biopsies. A same trend was observed whatever the stage of fibrosis. Conclusion: sampling Variability of fibrosis is a significant limit for fibrosis assessment with liver biopsy. This study suggests that a length of at least 25mm is necessary to valuably evaluate fibrosis with semiquantitative score. Sampling variability become a major limitation for more accurate method such as automated image analysis.

            "text": "We have reported that cells positive for Musashi-1 (Msi-1) protein appeared during spontaneous resolution of rat liver cirrhosis and that some Msi-1-postive cells were also positive for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, possibly implicating active participation of stem cells in the resolution of collagen. Though Msi-1 antigen is expected to be expressed during very early stage of differentiation in the cellular lineage of liver, the type of cells appeared in the damaged liver and expressed Msi-1 remain to be elucidated. The present study is designed to characterize the Msi-1-positive cells in cirrhotic liver from the aspect of differentiation, significance and expected function of stemlprogenitor cells in the liver, especially fibrolytic function. Methods: Rat liver fibrosislcirrhosis was established by intraperioneal injection of CC14 twice a week. Liver samples were obtained 2, 5 and 7 days after the last injection of 12-week CC14 intoxication. Liver tissue samples were immunohistochemically stained for Msi-1, c-kit, nestin, a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), CK-19 and MMP-13. Gene expression of Msi-1 was also observed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Neural stemlprogenitor cells, as defined by their expression of Msi-1 andlor nestin, were not observed either in normal rat liver or after 4 weeks of C C 4 administration. RT-PCR analysis revealed very slight signals of Msi-1 mRNA at 2 days after discontinuance of 8-week CCld treatment. On the contrary, remarkable increase of Msi-1 mRNA was observed at 2 days after the 12 weeks CCl4 treatment, then the signals decreased gradually. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that a considerable number of cells positive for Msi-1 appeared in the early recovery stage from advanced liver fibrosis, especially at day 5 after the last injection of 12 weeks CCl4 treatment. Expression of Msi-1 in liver tissue was proceeded by and partly overlapped with that of c-kit, a marker of hematopoietic stem cells. Some Msi-1-positive cells observed around perivenular regions were as very small as oval cells, while the size of Msi-1-positive cells present along the resolving fibrous bands varied and some of them expressed MMP-13. Some ductal cells were positive for Msi-1 but not for CK-19 examined in serial sections. Msi-1 positive cells did not express hepatocytes markers such as albumin or AFP. Cells positive for a-SMA and Msi-1 were observed in some portions, but most of Msi-1 expressing cells did not show positive staining for a-SMA or desmin. At day 7, a few Msi-1-positive cells were observed around the remaining fibrous bands. S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE REPRESSES THE fibrosis, constitute a good model for studying the mechanisms responsible for antifibrotic therapy. To test whether administration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, a precursor of glutathione and an agent shown to prevent liver toxicity in a variety of settings, could repress the activity of the mouse pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene in hepatic stellate cells, homozygous transgenic mice harboring the -17 kb to +54 bp of the proximal promoter of the mouse alpha 2(I) collagen gene cloned upstream of the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase reporter gene (LacZ) were used. Chronic liver injury was induced by injecting intraperitoneally 5 mllkg of body weight of CC4 (25% vlv in mineral oil) three times per week for 4 weeks. S-adenosyl-L-methionine was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mglkg of body weight every day for 4 weeks. Control groups were given either mineral oil or S-adenosyl-Lmethionine alone. Hepatocellular damage and protection by Sadenosyl-l-methionine was confirmed by measuring serum levels of transaminases; S-adenosyl-L-methionine lowered ALT levels in the CCL4-treated mice from 143 to 28 UlL and AST from 171 to 66 UlL (control values in the absence of CC14 were 26 and 58 UlL for ALT and AST, respectively). Hematoxylin and eosin staining in the CC14-treated mice revealed the presence of Mallory bodies, lymphocyte infiltration, centrilobular steatosis, and perivenular and pericellular fibrosis, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine minimized the pathology score. Masson's trichrome staining showed less collagen deposition in mice treated with CC14 plus S-adenosyl-Lmethionine than in the CC4-treated mice. Histochemical analysis using X-gal staining allowed for the precise identification of the cell type in which the beta-galactosidase gene was active as driven by the pro alpha 2(I) collagen promoter. Results indicated activation of the pro alpha 2(I) collagen promoter in mice treated with CCl, and repression of such activation in mice co-treated with S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Immunofluorescence analysis of mice injected with CC14 revealed colocaliiation of alpha-smooth muscle and beta-galactosidase positive cells, suggesting that the activation of the promoter occurred only in hepatic stellate cells. These results suggest that one mechanism by which administration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, a precursor of glutathione synthesis, could ameliorate liver fibrosis is by decreasing the responsiveness of the promoter of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene to a profibrogenic stimuli such as CCb. These transgenic mice should prove to be useful in further studies on how S-adenosyl-L-methionine exerts this repression of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene and perhaps to studies with other liver toxins such as alcohol. Background Endothelin-1 (ET-I), the most powerful constrictor of the liver vasculature and stimulator of the synthesis, by Kupffer cells, of a potent systemic vasodilator, platelet-activating factor, is also implicated in the fibrosis of lung, kidney and liver. Thus increased hepatic concentrations of ET-1 and its receptors in human and experimental cirrhosis suggest its major role in the pathology of chronic liver disease and its complications (fibrosis, portal hypertension and systemic hypotension). We investigated whether ET-1 receptor antagonism, after the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis, arrestslreverses the progression of chronic liver disease.

TAK-044 treatment reduced collagen synthesis as evidenced by decreased hepatic hydroxyproline, collagen-a type I mRNA expression, and mRNA and protein expression of a potent fibrogenic cytokine TGF-P1.

However p50 and p65 can form homodimers which have been described as inhibitors and stimulators of gene expression respectively. The aim of the study was to determine the role of the p50 subunit of NFkB in the progression of fibrosis. Methods -Chronic liver fibrosis was induced in p50 knockout and wild type control mice by administering twice weekly CCL4 injections for 12 weeks. Livers and blood samples were harvested at day 1, 3, 5,7 and 14 after the last CCL4 injection. Results -p50 knockout mice developed more severe liver disease as measured by serum ALT's and peak fibrosis scores. The increased liver injury in p50 knockout mice was associated with a massive infiltrate of inflammatory cells into the liver compared to the control wild type mice. The majority of the inflammation was neutrophilic as measured by immunohistochemistry, however we also observed an increase in CD3 positive T cells. Taqman quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to measure collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and TIMPl gene expression in the p50 knockout and wild type mice. All three genes were elevated in the mice laking p50 subunit of NFkB. Immunostaining confirmed an increase in aSMA positive cells in the livers of p50 knockout mice compared to wild type controls. Conclusion: the p50 subunit of NFkB may play an important role in protecting against the development of liver fibrosis and reducing liver inflammation in chronic liver injury.

Halofuginone is also responsible for the resolution of advanced fibrosis and increase in cirrhotic liver regeneration. MethodslAims In this study Atlas microarray technique was applied in vivo in an effort to identify genes involved in the halofuginone-dependent prevention of liver fibrosis. To that end we compared cDNA array hybridization of TAA-treated rat liver biopsies to biopsies of livers from rats treated with both TAA and halofuginone. Results From the 588 genes of the array, 13 were differentially expressed. One of the genes up-regulated by halofuginone was identified as protein tyrosine phosphatase of regeneration liver -1 (PRL-l), an immediate early gene known to be induced during liver regeneration. The Atlas microarray results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis and by in situ hybridization. HepG2 cells in culture expressed high levels of PRL-1 gene that was down-regulated upon serum starvation. Halofuginone increased the PRL-1 gene expression in the serum-starved cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. On the protein level, halofuginone caused translocation of PRL-1 from HepG2 and Huh-7 nucleus outer membranes to the cytosol as demonstrated by immunofluorescence using PRL-1 antibodies. PRL-1 translocation is known to be associated with alterations in cell cycle. Halofuginone caused accumulation of HepG2 cells in the GYM phase as analyzed by flow cytometry suggesting a putative G2IM arrest. Conclusions These results demonstrate the involvement of halofuginone in the hepatocytes cell cycle through PRL-1 gene expression and its cellular translocation. Nathalie Senant, Universitk Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France; Genevieve Freyburger, Hdpital Pellegrin, Bordeaux, France; Toulouse, France; Alexis Desmouliire, Universitk Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France Several lines of evidence incriminate the hemostasis system in liver fibrogenesis. First, experimental and human pathological data suggest a role for micro-thrombosis in fibrosis progression. Secondly, several hemostasis proteins, such as thrombin, can regulate the expression of fibrogenic mediators through signaling by cell-surface receptors. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the effect of direct thrombin inhibition on experimental liver fibrosis. Fibrosis was induced in rats by administration of CC14 in olive oil orally 3 times a week for either 3 or 7 weeks. The thrombin antagonist SSR 182289 (Sanofi-Synthelabo research) was given daily orally at 30 mglkg (a dose that has been shown to significantly inhibit thrombin in vivo) starting 1 week after the beginning of CC14 intoxication. Control groups received either the respective solvents or SSR 182289 alone. Nine animals were used in each group. Fibrosis was quantified with histomorphometrical analysis of Sirius red-stained liver sections and expressed as a percentage of the surface of the section. We also measured the level of fibrogenic cell activation with quantitation of the area occupied by alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA)-positive cells. The levels of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-I) transcripts were analyzed by Northern blot on total liver RNA and expressed as TIMP-l/GAPDH ratios following quantitative measurement with an Instant Imager. After 3 weeks of CC14, the area of fibrosis increased from 0.285 % 0.08 in controls to 2.62 i 0.68 % and was slightly but non significantly decreased by SSR 182289 (2.26 lr 0.62 %, NS). The area of ASMA-positive cells was however significantly decreased by SSR 182289 from 3.83 ? 1.04 to 2.86 i 0.79 % (p =0.03). In animals receiving CC14 for 7 weeks, treatment with SSR 182289 resulted in a decrease in fibrosis area from 7.01 t 0.24 to 4.62 t 0.77 % (p =0.05). Similarly, the ASMA-positive area decreased from 11.57 5 5.57 to 7.71 i 3.89 % (p =0.05). The TIMP-I/GAPDH ratio was decreased by SSR 182289 at 3 weeks (from 0.118 2 0.018 to 0.087 2 0.014, p =Om). SSR 182289 alone had no effect on the measured parameters at both time points. Additionally, it did not alleviate the acute toxicity of CC14 as shown by the levels of serum transaminases and the area of necrosis that were not significantly modified. Altogether, these data provide evidence that thrombin antagonism can reduce the extent of liver fibrosis in this model. Ongoing experiments should clarify whether this results from an anticoagulant effect or an inhibition of thrombin signaling effects. Center, Tel Aviv, Israel Background and Aims: Proliferation and \"activation\" of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and production of collagen are involved in the pathogenesis of liver inflammation and fibrogenesis. Ligands of nuclear hormone receptors, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and peroxisome proliferator activator receptor y (PPARy) ligands have been shown to affect fibrogenesis. Levels of PPARy are reduced in activated stellate cells and addition of the Iigand increases PPARy receptor expression and ameliorates fibrosis. In contrast, T3 has the opposite effect on liver fibrosis. Low circulating T3 levels reduces liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of T3, PPARy ligand and their combination on proliferation and activation of a rat HSC cell line. Methods: Transforming growth factor (TGF-PI) was used to induce myofibroblast-like phenotype in rat HSCs (HSC-T6). Activation of thyroid hormone and PPARy receptors was induced with T3 and 15-deoxy-prostaglandinJ(2)(PJ2), respectively. Signal transduction markers and activation marker a-smooth muscle actin were determined using Western blotting. Collagen I expression was measured by Northern blotting. Results: Both T3 and PJ (2) inhibit HSC proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor and by TGF-P. T3 inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, while PJ(2) reduces expression of proliferation marker cyclin D1. Both \"i3 and PJ(2) decrease expression of activation marker a-smooth muscle actin. In addition, T3 strongly increases both basal and TGFeinduced collagen I expression. By contrast, PJ(2) decreases collagen expression and inhibits T3-induced collagen production in TGFP-activated HSCs. Conclusion: Both T3 and PJ(2) reduce mitogen-induced proliferation of rat HSCs, but have different effects on collagen I expression. These results suggest that prolierationlactivation and collagen I expression are two differently regulated processes in Kato, Sadakazu Aiso, Hiromasa lshii, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a profibrogenic molecule involved in several human fibrotic disorders including liver fibrosis. In human as well as experimental liver fibrosis, CTGF overexpression, through upregulation of CTGF mRNA in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), is associated with the degree of fibrosis. It has been known CTGF is produced in many cell types in the live and exogenous CTGF modulates even the activation of HSCs.",

Cytochrome P-4502E1 (CYP2El)-mediated Oxidative stress, as a result of chronic and excessive ethanol consumption, has been implicated as a crucial factor in alcoholic liver fibrogenesis. The goal of a series of our studies was to clarify the effect of CYP2E1mediated ethanol oxidation on CTGF expression. We previously reported the results of the assay using the well-established HepG2 cell line constitutively expressing CYPZEI, which was kindly provided by Dr. A. Cederbaum ( Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, NY). CTGF mRNA quantitation assay by a real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a significant increase in CTGF mRNA levels in ethanol-treated E9 cells in a time-dependent manner up to 36 hours after initial ethanol treatment. There was nearly a 2-fold increase in CTGF mRNA levels when ethanoltreated E9 cells were coincubated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a reagent which enhances expression of CYP2E1. CTGF mRNA levels were significantly reduced when ethanol-treated E9 cells were co-incubated with 4-methylpyrazole(4MP), a CYP2El inhibitor, or antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and Trolox. In the present study, we visualized the state of oxidative stress in ethanol-treated E9 cells by using mAb5F6, a newly-established marker for oxidative stress. The mAb5F6, which was generously provided by Dr. K Uchida (Nagoya University, Japan), was raised against the acrolein-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin to verify the protein-bound acrolein in vivo. The staining, procedure was detailed elsewhere. Immunohistochemical detection of proteinbound acrolein revealed E9 cells were stained when treated with ethanol. Without ethanol treatment, no staining was observed in ETHANOL UPREGULATES PRO-FIBROTIC CONNECTIVE CELLS VIA CYTOCHROME P-4502E1-MEDIATED",

Methods: Changes in NTP-Dase2 expression in rat liver were determined in normal and 2-wk bile duct ligated (BDL) or 6-wk C C 4 rat livers and PFlPM using confocal immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and Northern blot. Changes in NTPDase2 expression in human liver were determined in de-paraffinized liver biopsy specimens using confocal immunofluorescence. Results: As was previously reported, NTP-Dase2 was expressed in PF surrounding intrahepatic bile ducts in normal and sham BDL controls. In BDL rat livers, however, NT-PDase2 fluorescence was completely lost. No decrease in NTP-Dase2 fluorescence was noted in CC14 rat livers within portal areas, although an increase in NTPDase2 fluorescence was seen in central areas. PF from sham BDL control animals expressed NT-PDase2 and the intermediate filament vimentin. \"PF\" from BDL animals did not express vimentin but were positive for a-smooth muscle actin (SMA), suggesting that they were in fact PMF. Most BDL PMF did not express NTPDase2; however, occasional cells were seen with SMA and NTPDase2 in a pen-nuclear compartment. Immunoblot analysis of PF revealed a marked decrease in NTPDase2 detection in BDL cells relative to sham BDL. No change was noted in CCll or C C 4 control cells. Northern blot analysis revealed no differences in NTPDase2 mRNA levels in sham BDL, BDL, CCl, control, or CC14 PF. Confocal micrographs of normal human biopsy specimens revealed NTPDase2 co-localization with vimentin in PF surrounding intrahepatic bile ducts. However, NTPDase2 fluorescence was either markedly decreased or lost in specimens from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. No loss of NTPDase2 fluorescence was seen in biopsy specimens from patients with Hepatitis C. Conclusions: NTPDase2 expression is specifically decreased in biliary fibrosis, largely through a posttranslational mechanism. \"Portal fibroblasts\" from BDL rats are in fact portal myofibroblasts, which lose expression of NTPDase2. Consistent with findings in rats, NTPDase2 expression is also specifically lost in human biliary fibrosis. Work is now underway to determine whether loss of NTPDase2 in the peri-biliary compartment alters nucleotide signaling in bile duct epithelia. Myofibroblasts of bone marrow origin have recently been found in a number of parenchymal organs such as the gut and kidney. We hypothesised that marrow derived myofibroblasts contribute to liver cirrhosis. METHODS. We sought to analyse the origin of myofibroblasts within cirrhotic liver in two scenarios: three male recipients of female liver transplants who have subsequently developed post transplant hepatitis C cirrhosis and a female recipient of a male bone marrow transplant who later developed hepatitis C induced cirrhosis. Through the use of in situ hybridisation for the Y chromosome we have been able to track cells of male origin. RESULTS. We have detected significant numbers of Y chromosome positive cells in fibrotic areas. By combining the in situ hybridisation with immunocytochemistry these cells were found to be positive for vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin and negative for CD45. These cells were therefore determined to be of a myofibroblast phenotype. In the liver transplant recipients, 15.4% (corrected count 33.6%) of the myofibroblasts were Y chromosome positive. In the female recipient of the male bone marrow transplant, 12.5% (corrected count 27.3%) of the myofibroblasts were Y chromosome positive. CONCLUSIONS. Within all the livers analysed we found frequent myofibroblasts within and adjacent to the fibrotic bands that are of bone marrow origin indicating an extrahepatic cell contribution to the pathogenesis of human liver cirrhosis. (HSC) is the major fibrogenic cell of the liver and a key target of potential antifibrotic therapies. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is antifibrotic in several models of experimental liver fibrosis, but its mechanism of action is uncertain. Potential use of HGF as a therapeutic peptide is limited by its size and need for parenteral administration. To overcome these potential limitations, Refanlin has been developed as a synthetic small molecule SFlHGF mimetic, that has demonstrated antifibrotic properties in renal fibrosis. Aim: To study the in vitro and in vivo antifibrotic efficacy of Refanlin. Methods: Serum starved LX2 cells, an immortalized human HSC line, were treated with 12 mglml of Refanlin for 24 hours. Proliferation studies using tritiated thymidine incorporation were performed. RNA was isolated, and a panel of fibrosis markers (al-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), collagen I, bPDGF-receptor, 9, 14 (MMP2, 9, 14) , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1,2 (TIMP1,2), were assessed by real time RT-PCR analysis. Cirrhosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by IF thioacetamide (TAA) (200 mg/kg TIW) for six weeks. In the Refanlin treated group, 1 mglkg of Refanlin was administered five days per week for six weeks, concurrently with the TAA. Control rats received IP PBS five days per week for six weeks, along with TAA. Liver tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, then stained with 1% picrosirius red and computer morphometric analysis was performed for collagen quantitation using the Bio-quantTM software. Results: In cultured human stellate cells, there was a 60% decrease in ASMA, a 70% decrease in the expression of TGFb-receptor and MMP2, and a 50% decrease in TIMP2. There was no effect on proliferation. In vivo, fibrosis decreased by one Metavir stage in rats treated with C6 and thioacetamide for 6 weeks. Furthermore, C6 led to a significant decrease in portal pressure compared with non-treated rats with fibrosis. Conclusions: Refanlin may have antifibrotic efficacy through its inhibition or downregulation of TGFb receptor as well as MMP2. In vivo antifibrotic activity of Refanlin is associated with reduced portal pressure. These experiments better define the potential targets of HGF's antifibrotic activity. Ongoing studies in mechanistically distinct models of fibrosis will broaden our understanding of this agent's effects and point towards therapeutic trials in humans. Kanto, Aki Sato, Michiyo Inoue, Hideki Miyatake, Mitsuru Sakakibara, Takayuki Yakushijin, Chika Oki, Tetsuo Takehara, Norio Hayashi, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan Background and Aim Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces a wide range of chronic liver injuries. Impaired Thl response against HCV may be involved in HCV persistence, however, its precise mechanism is largely unknown. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells that play essential roles in initiating as well as regulating anti-virus immune responses. Blood DC are grouped as myeloid (MDC) and plasmacytoid DC (PDC). With respect to their functions, MDC produces IL-12 and TNF-a upon stimulation and drives Thl response, while PDC releases considerable amount of type-I IFN upon virus infection and mainly skews Th2. We previously reported that monocytederived DC is functionally impaired (Kanto T. et al. J lmrnunol 1998) , however, the roles of blood DC subsets in the direction of ThllTh2 in HCV infection are still elusive. To address these issues, we compared the numbers and functions of MDC and PDC between chronically HCV-infected patients and uninfected donors. Subjects and Methods Sixty-six HCV-positive patients (43 chronic hepatitis and 23 asymptomatic carriers) and 19 agematched uninfected donors were enrolled. MDC or PDC was determined by the patterns of Lineage markers, HLA-DR, CDllc and CD123. Each type of DC was magnetically separated or sorted under FACS Vantage and was subjected to the functional analyses. The ability of DC to polarize naive CD4 T-cells towards Thl or Th2 was estimated by the pattern of IFN-ylIL.-4/IL-10 production from MDC-or PDC-primed CD4. Results Absolute numbers of MDC, PDC and their CD34+ progenitors are lower in HCV-infected patients than in control subjects, most significantly in those with chronic active hepatitis (MDC, PDC, CD34, median, patients vs. controls; 4.2,1.0,0.511*.1 vs. 6.9,3.0,1.9/pl, p<0.05). Both types of DC from patients are impaired in the stimulation of allogeneic CD4 T-cells and the production of IL-12 p70 or IFN-a compared with healthy donors. On encounter with naYve CD4 T-cells, MDC from the patients are less able to drive Thl response, while PDC from them prime more IL-10 producing T-cells than those from donors. Exogenous IL-12 significantly improved the patient MDCdriven Thl response, however, it simultaneously increased IL-10 producers both in MDC and PDC. In contrast, IFN-y or IL-15 stimulated the patient MDC to drive Thl without increasing MDC-or PDC-primed IL-10 producing cells. Conclusion Both types of blood DC in chronic HCV infection are reduced and play decisive roles in the development of an impaired Thl and an IL-10-rich environment, thus favoring HCV persistence. IFN-y or IL-15 is feasible to restore the altered T-cell polarizing ability of blood DC in chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicates its genome in a membraneassociated complex composed of viral nonstructural proteins and RNA as well as altered cytoplasmic membranes and other as yet unidentified host cell components. A specific membrane alteration, designated membranous web, was recently identified as the site of HCV RNA replication in Huh-7 cells harboring subgenomic replicons (Gosert et al. J Virol 2003; 77:5487-5492) . Here, we describe HCV replicons that allow the direct visualization of HCV replication complexes in living cells. Methods: A transposon-mediated random insertion screen followed by selection of viable replicons was performed to identify sites that tolerate insertions in nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence was subsequently inserted into selected sites. RNA was in vitro transcribed from subgenomic replicon constructs harboring these insertions, followed by electroporation into Huh-7 cells and selection in the presence of G418. Results: Two sites in the C-terminal domain of NS5A were found to tolerate the GFP insertion and allowed efficient initiation and maintenance of HCV RNA replication. Expression of a NS5A-GFP fusion protein of the expected molecular mass could be demonstrated by immunoblot, indicating that the GFP was stably retained and that processing of the viral protein occurred normally. More important, expression levels were robust enough to allow direct visualization of this fusion protein by fluorescence microscopy. GFP fluorescence was found in a cytoplasmic reticular pattern and in brightly fluorescing dots, the typical distribution of HCV nonstructural proteins in replicon cells. By confocal laser scanning microscopy, GFP fluorescence was found to colocalize with other HCV nonstructural proteins in the brightly fluorescing dots, suggesting that these represent HCV replication complexes, previously identified as membranous webs. Metabolic labeling of the nascent viral RNA with BrUTP and (immuno)electron microscopy studies are underway to further validate these findings. Moreover, live cell imaging studies using these replicons have successfully been initiated. Conclusion: We have identified sites in NS5A that allow insertion of GFP in the context of functional HCV replicons and direct visualization of HCV replication complexes in living cells. These findings have implications for the structure and function of the HCV NS5A protein as well as for the architecture of the HCV replication complex. This system will allow to gain a dynamic view of the formation and turnover of HCV replication complexes and may be useful to select for cell populations permissive for HCV RNA replication. INFECTION. Masahisa Jinushi, Tetsuo Takehara, Tomohide Tatsumi, Takuya Miyagi, Takahiro Suzuki, Tatsuya Kanto, Norio Hayashi, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan Background and Aim It has been generally accepted that the pertubation of cellular immunity plays an important role in establishment and persistence of chronicity in HCV infection as well as resistance to IFN therapy. Accumulating lines of evidence have unveiled that dendritic cells (DCs), most potent antigen presenting cells, are impaired in patients with HCV infection, which may be involved in disturbance of anti-HCV immune responses. We recently reported that MHC class I-related chain A and B(MICAl B),ligands of NK activating receptor NKGZD, are induced on DCs upon interferonaand gain their ability to antivate NK cells; their expression is severely impaired in DCs derived from HCV-infected individuals (HCV-DC) (3. Immunol. 170 1249 Immunol. 170 -1256 Immunol. 170 ,2003 . In the present study, we evaluated whether various types of cytokines have an effect for inducing MICAlB expression on HCV-DCs, thus resulting in triggering NK cell activation by DCs. Methods DCs from healthy volunteers (N-DCs; n=15) or HCV-DCs (n=20) were generated from monocyte treated with GM-CSF (1000 Ulml) and IL-4 (500 Ulml) for 6 days. After stimulated with various cytokines (IFNalP, IFNy, TNFa, IL-12, IL-15 or IL-18) for 24 h, DCs were subjected to flow cytometric analysis of MICAlB expression. To investigate the involvement of each cytokine in MICA/B expression on IFNalp-stimulated DCs, we employed ELISA and RT-PCR to examine the cytokine expression (TNFa, IL-lp, IL-6, IL-12~70, IL-15 and IL-18) in IFNalp-stimulated DCs, and also assessed MICAlB expression on DCs in the presence of neutralizing antibodies for these cytokines. To further address the stimulatory capacity of DC, allogeneic NK cells were cocultured with N-DCs or HCV-DCs at a ratio of 5:l for 24 h, and applied for flow cytometry of intracellular IFNy expression, as well as 51Cr release assay for the cytolysis of K562 target cells. In some experiments, masking antibody for NKG2D or MICAlB was added during NKlDC cocultures, and then subjected to NK cell function assays described above. Results MICAlB were induced on N-DCs, but not on HCV-DCs, upon IIFNalP(% MIC positive: N-DC 42.1% vs HCV-DC 3.4%; p<O.Ol). In sharp contrast, MICAlB expression was increased on HCV-DCs at levels similar to N-DCs in the presence of of 5OnglmL IL-15 (but not other cytokines) (%MIC: N-DCs 49.4% vs HCV-DCs 47.6%). Moreover, N-DCs, but not HCV-DCs, was capable of producing IL-15 in response to IFNalp. Little differences were detected in N-DCs and HCV-DCs for the production of TNFa, IL-lp, 1L-6, IL-12~70, or IL-18. In addition, IFNalp-mediated MICAlB induction in N-DCs were completely inhibited in the presence of neutralizing antibody of anti-IL15l IL-15 receptorcu. Even much lower doses (1nglmL) of IL-15 restored the ability of HCV-DCs to induce MICAlB and to activate NK cells in response to IFNalP. The ability of HCV-DCs for NK cell activation was largely diminished by adding the masking antibody of NKG2D or MICAlB. Conclusion The current study demonstrated that IL-15 acts as an indispensable mediator to induce MICAlB expression on IFNalp-stimulated DCs, and that HCV-DCs lack the ability to produce IL-15 and to induce MICAlB expression in response to IFNalP. Since defect in IL-15 production is responsible for impaired NK cell activities by HCV-DCs, these findings shed light on the possibility that IL-15 could improve the IFN-mediated anti-viral immune responses in chronic HCV-infected patients. The cellular immune response contributes to viral clearance as well as liver injury in acute and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Understanding the relative immunodominance of HCVencoded peptides is important for understanding pathogenesis as well as potential vaccine candidates. We have developed a comprehensive and sensitive method to screen immune responses to all potential HCV epitopes in HCV-exposed individuals. Methods: Subjects with evidence of spontaneously resolved infection (EIA+/HCV RNA-neg, n = 15) and patients with evidence of chronic HCV infection (mean HCV RNA level = 23.6 million copieslml; n = 15, all genotype la) had either leukophoresis or one-unit blood draw. We synthesized 750 peptides (15 mer-peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids) that spanned the entire HCV genotype l a polyprotein; responses to 33 pools of peptides were screened directly ex vivo by an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay. Briefly, autologous dendritic cells (DCs) were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells selected by plastic adherence then cultured with GMCSF, IL-4 and 10% HS for 5 d. DCs were pulsed with peptide pools to stimulate bead-purified CD8+ T cells. The remaining CD4+ T cells (5.0 X lo5 cells/well) were stimulated the same day with the peptide pools; 10 wells with no peptide (or SIV peptides) were used as controls. Only responses greater mean + 3 SDs above controls were considered positive.",

There was an inverse trend between # peptide pools with CD4+ T cell responses and HCV RNA level. As shown in the figure, the HCV peptide pools differentially elicited responses; specifically, resolved infection was associated with greater CD4+ responses to pools core B, ElA, NS3 protease-2, NS3 helicase-3, NS3 helicase-4, NS3 helicase-5, NS3 helicase-6, NS4B-2, NS5A-2, NS5A-3, NS5B-2. On the average, CD8+ T cells responded to 4.8 pools in resolved infection vs. 1.3 pools in chronics (p =.as). CD8+ T cell responses specifically directed against core 8, NS3 helicase-5, NS3-helicase 6, NS4B-2, NS5A-2 were more frequent in resolved as compared to chronic infection. Conclusions: Comprehensive mapping of HCV-specific immune responses by overlapping pools reveals significant differences in immunogenicity in resolved vs. chronic infection. In particular, regions core B (amino acids 96-203), NS3 helicase-5 (aa 1369-1479) and helicase-6 (1469-1579), NS4B-2 (1801-1899), NS5A-2 (2076-2191) induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity and thus represent potential vaccine candidates.

We hypothesized that viral-induced insulin resistance (IR) may be a mechanism for fibrogenesis in chronic HCV infection. Methods and results: 1. To assess the influence of HCV infection on IR independent of any effect of hepatic fibrosis, 121 HCV subjects with minimal (stage 1) or no (stage 0) fibrosis were compared with 137 healthy volunteers matched by gender, body mass index (BMI) and waistlhip ratio. Although the HCV subjects were younger than the healthy volunteers (P=0.004), they had significantly higher levels of markers of IR including fasting glucose (P=O.Ol), insulin (P=O.O02), cpeptide (P<O.OOl) and HOMA-IR (P=O.O02). 2. In 260 HCV patients (fibrosis stage 0 to 4), e examined the viral and diseaserelated factors (portallperiportal & lobular inflammation, viral genotype) which may be involved in the pathogenesis of IR in a multivariate model, controlling for other demographic and biochemical variables. By multiple linear regression analysis, independent predictors of HOMA-IR included BMI (P<O.OOl), failed previous antiviral treatment (P<O.OOl), portal inflammatory grade (P<O.OOl) and genotype 3 status (P=O.Ol). Genotype 3 cases had significantly lower HOMA-IR than other genotypes at each stage of hepatic fibrosis. The adjusted difference in HOMA-IR between genotype 3 and non-genotype 3 was -0.58 (95% CI: -0.13 to -1.02; P=O.Ol). 3. We then assessed if IR was associated with increased fibrotic severity. By multiple ordinal regression analysis, independent predictors for the stage of fibrosis in the 260 HCV subjects were HOMA-IR (OR 1.3, P<O.OOl), portal inflammatory grade (OR: 5.3, P<O.OOl), past alcohol intake (OR 1.7, P<O.OOl), age (OR 1.1, P <0.001), ALT (OR 1.0, P=0.04), platelet count (OR 0.93, P<O.OOl), and serum cholesterol level (OR 0.65, P=O.OOl). As cirrhosis is known to cause IR, a separate multivariate analysis was performed for the 236 non-cirrhotic subjects. The independent predictors for fibrosis were unaltered and HOMA-IR remained in the model. In a subgroup of 117 patients with estimated duration of infection, multiple linear regression analysis showed that HOMA-IR was independently associated with an increased rate of fibrosis progression (P=0.03). Conclusion: HCV infection induces insulin resistance irrespective of the severity of liver disease, and this effect appears to be genotype-specific. Further, increased insulin resistance contributes to fibrotic progression. Disclosures:",

Modeling of HCV RNA decay in response to antiviral therapy can provide insight into viral and host determinants of viral response. Aims: Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunologic outcomes were evaluated on 24 co-infected patients: 1) To evaluate the relationship between HCV RNA decay and PEG-IFN alfa2b serum concentrations in HIVlHCV co-infected patients and 2) to evaluate association between HCV-specific immune responses and virologic outcome.

CD4+ cell proliferative responses to HCV antigens (core, NS3, NS4, NS5) and HIV-1 gag were performed at baseline, day 7 and 14, and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Among 24 co-infected patients, 21 are males, the mean age was 46 2 5.8 years, 8 are Caucasian, 12 are African-American and 4 are Hispanic. 20l24 patients were infected with genotype 1, 3/24 patients with genotype 2, and 1/24 with genotype 3a. Results: Pharmacokinetics: To date, 21 patients have been evaluated. 10/21 patients were end of treatment responders, but 2 of these were \"late responders\" (i.e. HCV RNA declines after week 8 and is undetectable by week 24). Data fitting during the first seven days revealed a free virion clearance rate c of 13.3 (day-l) and an infected cell clearance rate 6 of 0.21 (day-'). The half-lives were 2.7 hours and 4.0 days, respectively. Pharmacodvnamics: Viron production was blocked after the first dose of PEG-IFN alfa with an average maximum effectiveness (emax ) of 89%. We estimated that the fifty percent effective concentration (EC50) of PEG-IFN alfa2b, the theoretical in v i m drug concentration at which the drug efficacy is 5070, was five-fold lower in responders compared with non-responders while the maximum (Cmax) and minimum (C,,,in) concentrations did not differ significantly ( Table I ). The calculated minimum ( \u20ac , , , i n ) and maximum (emax) efficacy were also significantly increased in responders. Immunolonic: The mean number of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cells did not differ significantly at baseline or during treatment between responders and nonresponders. Peripheral blood CD4+ HCV-specific proliferative responses did not differ significantly between responders and nonresponders except that the response to core antigen was increased in non-responders compared with responders at weeks 4 and 12. HIV gag CD4+ proliferative responses were stronger than HCV-specific responses at all time points evaluated. Conclusions: The serum PEG-IFN alfa2b concentration necessary for an end of treatment response is fivefold lower in responders compared with non-responders while there are no significant differences in the maximum and minimum PEG-IFN alfa2b concentrations in responders and nonresponders. These data suggest that host factors responsible for a viral response may be different in responders compared with nonresponders, independent of serum PEG-IFN alfa2b concentrations. is a significant predictor of liver disease severity in patients who are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). This accelerated liver disease is presumed to be due, in part, to HN-related immune suppression. HCV quasispecies variability is likely a marker of immune pressure on the virus. Hyuotheses: 1. HCV quasispecies variability is decreased in those with HIV coinfection, and 2. Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is associated with increased variability, Methods: HCV-infected patients with or without HIV were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Patients with genotype 1 infection and a parenteral risk factor for HCV were included. Those with injection drug use (IDU) were estimated to have acquired HCV 2 years after the onset of IDU. Alcohol use was determined using standard questionnaires. HAART data were collected from the HIV clinic's database. Only those with complete records were included. HCVquasispecies variability was determined using clonal frequency analysis of the second envelope gene hypervariable region. Quasispecies heterogeneity was characterized according to complexity (the normalized number of unique quasispecies variants within a sample) and diversity (the average genetic distance between individual variants within the same sample). Groups were compared using the student t-test for unequal variances, ANOVA and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test where appropriate. Linear regression was used to assess the independent effects of HIV infection and HAART on complexity and diversity. Results: To date quasispecies data are available on 43 patients, 22 of whom are HIVpositive. As expected, HIV+ subjects had significantly lower CD4 counts (mean 508 vs 956 cellslul, P<.OOOl). Mean age and HCV duration were significantly lower in the HIV+ group (40.3 vs 45.5, P=.0017, and 15.7 vs 22.2 years, P=.OO18, respectively). The groups did not differ with respect to alcohol use over their lifetime or in the 6 months prior to enrollment. Quasispecies complexity and diversity are detailed in the table below. While there was no significant difference among groups by ANOVA (P=.16), the HIV+ subjects not on HAART had less complexity and diversity than the other two groups, and differences between Groups 1 and 2 and Groups 2 and 3 were significant (Table) . Both HIV infection and HAART were significantly and independently associated with complexity in a linear regression model; HIV infection predicted decreased complexity (P= .001), while HAART predicted increased complexity (P=.007). In addition, higher alcohol use in the prior 6 months was independently associated with decreased complexity (P=.007). HIV infection and HAART also were independently associated with decreased and increased diversity, respectively (P=.OOl and.034). The CD4 count did not predict complexity or diversity, and the effect of HAART appeared to be independent of the CD4 count. Conclusion: HCV coinfection with HIV is associated with decreased HCV quasispecies complexity and diversity. While this effect is not completely reversed by HAART, treatment of HIV is associated with significantly increased HCV complexity and diversity in our sample. Furthermore, the effect of HAART on HCV quasispecies variability appears to be independent of its effect on the CD4 count. These findings suggest that the immune pressure on HCV is enhanced in HCVlHN coinfected individuals who are on HAART when compared to those who are not on HAART.",

Considering dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in initiating and modulating immune responses, we explored the effect of HCV proteins on DC genetic expression, phenotype, and function. Methods: Human dendritic cells (DCs) were generated following plastic adherence of monocytes from normal subjects and culture with GM-CSF and IL-4. Autologous non-adherent cells were infected with vaccinia constructs expressing various HCV proteins (core, NSSa, NS5b) or an irrelevant protein /3-galactosidase @-gal) as the control. Following induction of apoptosis with UV irradiation, these vaccinia-infected cells were co-cultured with DCs. The phenotype, gene expression profiles and functions of the DCs were analyzed. DCs were evaluated after 8, 30, and 48 hrs of co-culture as well as after maturation with a cytokine cocktail (TNF-a, IL-lp, PGE2, IL-6) for an additional 48 hrs. Results: By FACS analysis, we found no alteration in expression of co-stimulatory markers (CDSO, CD86, CD40,) or MHC class I or I1 molecules. By ELISPOT assay, we found that the recall response of CD4t T cells for CMV following pulsing of HCV-DC or control (P-gal)-DC was also not altered. However, between 2-10% of the genes probed in the BD Clontech nylon array were differentially regulated. Real time PCR has confirmed increased expression of scyc 1 (lymphotactin) in the presence of NS5a in 2 normals as well as 2 separate biological replicates. Both Clontech and Affymetrix gene arrays revealed NS5a-induced increases in expression of IL-8, a chemokine with pro-inflammatory properties. Functional assays reveal that DCs which had engulfed apoptotic cells containing HCV core, NS5a, or NS5b demonstrated comparable ability to macropinocytose as measured by uptake of dextran-FITC or albumin-FITC when compared to P-gal-DCs. However, following uptake, the HCV-DCs died at a significantly greater rate than P-gal-DCs (-30%). Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate that following engulfment of apoptotic cells containing HCV proteins, differential gene expression occurs in human dendritic cells, although the expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules and ability to stimulate memory (CMV) responses remain intact. The mechanisms underlying the surprising induction of death of DC-HCV in the macropinocytosis assay is currently under further investigation. Institutes of Health, Bethesdu, MD Steatosis is a common histological feature of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The cause of hepatic steatosis in hepatitis C remains to be elucidated, but its association with obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia suggests an underlying metabolic dysfunction similar to that found in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Additionally, recent data suggest an association between body mass index (BMI) and the degree of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in HCV infection. Insulin resistance (IR) is a key factor in the pathogenesis of NASH and may play a similar role in the steatosis seen in chronic hepatitis C &: To compare the prevalence and severity of hepatic steatosis, visceral adiposity, J R and their relation to disease severity in African Americans (AA) vs Caucasians (CA) with genotype 1 HCV infection being considered for anti-viral therapy. Methods: Virahep-C is a prospective study of response rates to peginterferon and ribavirin in treatment-na'ive AA vs CA patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. All patients underwent liver biopsy within 18 months of enrollment. Biopsies were read blindly by a central pathologist and scored for inflammation and fibrosis using the histologic activity index [I-IAII and for steatosis (0-4+) and features of steatohepatitis (zone 3 ballooning, zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis and Mallory bodies). Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio were measured as determinants of visceral adiposity. IR was determined using fasting glucose and insulin levels based upon the HOMA method. Results: To date, 177 patients have been enrolled and 166 have complete liver biopsy information (75 AA and 91 CA). Steatosis was present in 66 patients (40%) with similar rates among AA (39%) and CA (41% CA). Grades of steatosis were also similar between AA and CA 1+ (38% vs 41%), 2+ (45% vs 27%), 3+ (14% vs 27%) and 4+ (3% vs 5%) (p = ns). Patients with steatosis had significantly higher values for HOMA index (4.0 vs 2.4, p<O.Ol), total HAI score (10.3 vs 8.7, p<O.OOOl), HAI inflammation score (8.5 vs 7.1, p<O.OOOl), waist circumference (40.2 in vs 36.5 inches, p<O.OOOl) and BMI (30.6 vs 26.7, p<O.oOOl). There were no significant differences in amount of alcohol consumption between patients with and without steatosis. Spearman's non-parametric correlations were performed to assess associations between the ordinal variables (scores for fat, steatohepatitis ballooning degeneration + perisinusoidal fibrosis + Mallory bodies], total HAI, inflammation and fibrosis) and one continuous variable (HOMA index). Waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, BMI, HOMA index, total HAI, HAI inflammation and HAI fibrosis all correlated with both the fat score and steatohepatitis score (p<O.Ol). Median HOMA index levels were significantly greater among AA than CA (3.1 vs 2.7, p< 0.05), but step-wise logistic regression showed that race was not an independent predictor of steatosis after controlling for ALT, AST, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, BMI and HOMA index. Conclusions: In patients with chronic hepatitis C and genotype 1, steatosis and steatohepatitis correlate strongly with the presence of insulin resistance and visceral adiposity. Race is not an independent predictor of steatosis after controlling for other factors. Bulk populations of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) contain myeloid DCs and plasmacytoid DCs. Myeloid DCs polarize T lymphocytes to Thl phenotype that produce interferon (1FN)-7. Plasmacytoid DCs produce abundant amounts of interferon (1FN)-alpha. Both IFN-?-producing T cells and adequate amounts of IFN-alpha are essential for viral clearance. In patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, DCs are infected with HCV, which is presumed to have a role in viral persistence. However the functional implication of this has not been addressed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the functional capabilities of both myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs in patients with chronic HCV infection. Myeloid DCs were defined as linage-, CDllc+, HLA DR+ and CD123-cells, and plasmacytoid DCs as lineage-, HLA DR+, CDllcand CD123+ cells among the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs were measured in 64 patients with chronic HCV infection and 34 agematched control subjects by four-color flow cytometry. To assess the production of IFN-alpha by plasmacytoid DCs, these were cultured with graded doses of herpes simplex virus-1 (10-100 plaque-forming unitslDC). The frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs expressing intracellular IFN-alpha among total plasmacytoid DCs were counted by two-color flow cytometry. To evaluate the capacity of myeloid DCs to induce Th polarization, DCs were cultured with autologous naive T cells for 7 days. Polarization of T cells to Thl phenotype was assumed when na'ive T cells expressed intracellular IFN-y. Steatosis has been reported to occur in up to 50% of liver biopsies in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Risk factors for steatosis include alcohol abuse and those found in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: obesity, increasing age, insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia. Studies have shown an association between genotype 3 and hepatic steatosis in chronic HCV infection, and others have found an association between steatosis and fibrosis stage. Previously published studies have been based primarily on cohorts of clinic referral patients and often have not analyzed for confounding variables. We herein report a population-based study of hepatic steatosis in hepatitis C. Methods: In a study of 924 Alaska NativestAmerican Indians with chronic HCV infection, 185 patients underwent at least one percutaneous liver biopsy as part of evaluation for treatment. All patients had a positive HCV RNA by PCR and were negative for HBsAg and HIV. All biopsy slides were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to patient identity, demographic, clinical and biological data. Histologic activity was scored using the Knodell system and fibrosis using the Ishak system. Steatosis was graded as 0, 1 (4 So%), 2 (30-65%), and 3 (> 65%). Patients were analyzed for a) gender, age, estimated length of infection and BMI at the time of biopsy, b) genotype, current ethanol use, HCV RNA within 1 year of biopsy, c) ALT within 30 days of biopsy, and d) histologic activity and fibrosis found on biopsy, using univariable and multivariable analysis. Results: Steatosis was found in 79/185(43%) of liver biopsies; 62 (33%) had grade 1; 13 (7%) grade 2, and 4 (2%) grade 3. Genotype distribution was as follows: 114 genotype 1 (62%), 44 genotype 2 (24%), and 27 genotype 3 (14%). Steatosis was found in 39% (441114) of genotype 1,48% (21/44) of genotype 2, and 52% (14/27) of genotype 3 patients (p = 0.34). Grade 2 or 3 was found in 6% (7/114) of genotype 1, 11% (5/44) of genotype 2, and 19% (5/27) of genotype 3 patients (p = 0.09). There was no significant association found between steatosis and gender (p = 0.93); age at biopsy date (p = 0.09); ALT (p = 0.58); histologic activity (p = 0.27), viral load (p = 0.27) and estimated length of infection (p = 0.22). There was a significant association of steatosis with BMI (< 0.01), fibrosis score (p < 0.01) and current ethanol use (p = 0.03). BMI 2 30 occurred in 52% (42/81) of genotype 1, 39% (11/28) of genotype 2, and 27% (6/22) of genotype 3 patients (p = 0.10). After controlling for BMI, there was no significant relationship found between steatosis and genotype. For BMI < 30, 23% (9/39) of genotype 1, 47% (8/17) of genotype 2, and 50%(8/16) of genotype 3 patients had steatosis (p = 0.08). For BMI 2 30,60% (25142) of genotype 1,55%",

We did find that Ishak fi-brosis score, BMI and current ethanol use were associated with steatosis after adjustment for HCV infection length, but age and histologic activity were not associated. infection results in necroinflammatory liver disease characterized by the insidious progression of hepatic fibrosis and loss of functioning hepatocyte mass. A cell-mediated immune response with prominent lymphocytic infiltration of liver is thought to play a major role in pathogenesis, although little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the liver injury associated with this viral infection. On the other hand, non-immune mechanisms have also been proposed as another mechanistic candidate for such sophisticated processes. The recent intensive interest is that the expression of HCV proteins seemingly alters lipid metabolism and transport in the liver in association with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated carcinogenesis, although the molecular basis of underlying mechanisms as well as responsible elements of HCV gene for this is yet to be established. Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify whether HCV core protein expression directly alters lipid metabolism-relating enzymes to (cause steatosis, especially focusing on nuclear receptors and ATP binding cassette transporter proteins expression. Methods: 1. The complementary DNA clone of full length HCV core (aa 1-191) was derived from serum of HCV I b patient by reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction, and HCV-core expression plasmid (pCAG-HCVcore) was prepared by a standard procedure. Control plasmid was also prepared with P-galactosidase (pCAG-LacZ). 2. HepG2 cells were transfected with pCAG-HCVcore or pCAG-LacZ, thereafter harvested for enzymatic triglycerides (TG) assay, HCV core antigen rneasurement by ELISA at 24 h or 48 h. Also, lipid metabolism-related enzymes mRNA expression was estimated by semi-quantified RT-PCR; mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acids ,&oxidation, o-oxidation, ABC transporters (Mdr3, Mrp2, Bsep), microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP), LDL receptor, and nuclear receptors. Resultss: 1. HCV core expression was evidenced at 24 and 48 h at the similar level. 2. Hepatic TG was increased in HCV core expressing cells, along with down-regulation of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A(CPTlA), a precious protein in liver mitochondrial fatty acid@-oxidation (50% at 24 h, 85% at 48) and up-regulation of acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOl), a precious protein in peroxisomal fatty acidso-oxidation (130% at 48 h). Cyp4A11, a precious protein in microsomal o-oxidation, and MTP, a precious protein in VLDL assembly, were not detected or unchanged. Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases and helicase-like proteins share 6 conserved motifs. Alignments reveal that several additional conserved motifs are present in the SF2 helicase encoded by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The roles of two such motifs are examined here using structure-based site-directed mutagenesis. The first motif (YRGxDV) forms a loop that connects SF2 helicase motifs 4 and 5, at the tip of which is Arg393. When Arg393 is changed to Ala, the resulting protein retains a nucleic acid stimulated ATPase but cannot unwind RNA, unwinds DNA poorly, and does not translocate on ssDNA. DNA and RNA stimulate ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by R393A like the wildtype but the mutant protein binds DNA more weakly than wildtype both in the presence and absence of a non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogue. Thus, this \"Arg-clamp\" motif anchors the protein on nucleic acid enabling processive unwinding. The second motif (DFSLDPTF) forms a beta-loop between SF2 motifs 5 and 6 that connects domains 2 and 3. When F444 in this \"beta-arm\" is changed to Ala, the resulting protein is devoid of all activities. When F438 is changed to Ala, the protein retains nucleic acid stimulated AT-Pase, but unwinds DNA and RNA poorly. In this case, uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and unwinding is due to the fact that the F438A mutant does not release DNA upon ATP binding like the wildtype. The F438A mutant also has a lower melting temperature than the wildtype indicating the hydrophobic pocket formed by the beta-arm and residues in domain 3 stabilizes the protein. Data support an inchworm model for helicase action and identify two new potential sites for rational HCV drug design.

This transactivating protein is secreted by HIV-infected cells and taken up by neighboring cells. Tat modulates expression of specific cellular genes and may be a key player in the interactions between HIV and other infections. One of the most common coinfections observed among HIV patients is hepatitis C virus (HCV). If HIV Tat has an effect on HCV replication, this could help explain the rapid development of liver disease and cancer among HIV patients. AIM This study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tat alters HCV replication. METHODS: Soluble Tat was added to the media of HUH-7 cells containing a HCV replicon. Replicon replication was quantitated using a ribonuclease protection assay. Using an LTR-luciferase plasmid to transfect HeLa cells, we developed a series of controls outlining the relative oxidative state of the Tat protein. RESULTS Exposure to Tat protein in the reduced state substantially increased HCV replicon replication. Oxidized Tat was found to have no significant effect on the replication of the replicon. The increase was dependant on length of exposure to Tat and the concentration of Tat. PRESENT WORK: Further assays seek to define the nature of the effect by Tat on HCV replication. CONCLUSION: Tat may upregulate HCV replication directly or indirectly, and thereby play a role in modulation of HCV infection and pathogenesis. Elucidating the complex interactions between HIV and HCV will be critical in evaluating and developing workable treatments for the increasing number of coinfected HIV/HCV persons with liver disease.

We have found previously that expression of hepatitis C virus proteins in cell lines or in the liver of transgenic mice inhibits interferon alpha induced signaling through the Jak-STAT pathway (Heim et al., J Virol, 1999, 73:8469 and Blindenbacher et al., Gastroenterology, 2003, 1241465) . The aim of the present study was to investigate if the same inhibition takes place in livers cells of patients with chronic hepatitis C. From February 2001 to April 2002, all patients with chronic hepatitis C referred to the outpatient liver clinic of the University Hospital Basel were asked for their permission to use part of the liver biopsy for this study. For non-HCV controls, patients that underwent ultrasoundguided liver biopsies of focal lesions (mostly metastasis of carcinomas) were asked for their permission to obtain a biopsy from the normal liver tissue outside the focal lesion. The protocol was approved by the ethical commission of Basel. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients that agreed to participate in the study. After removal of a 20 to 25mm long biopsy specimen for routine histopathological workup for grading and staging of the liver disease, the remaining 5 to 20 mm long biopsy cylinders were immediately incubated in PBS or PBS with human interferon alpha (lo00 IUlml) for 10 to 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The samples were then used for the preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts and in some cases for immunofluorescence studies.",

Biopsy samples of patient with different degrees of fibrosis were incubated for 0, 10, 20,30 and 60 minutes, and the nuclear translocation (a surrogate marker for activation) of STATl was visualized by immunofluorescence. We found a transient activation of STAT1, with a peak after 20 minutes of stimulation with interferon alpha. The signal was shut down in all biopsies after 60 minutes. Interferon alpha diffused readily in the biopsy cylinders regardless of the degree of fibrosis. In the second part, 44 consecutive biopsies of patients with chronic hepatitis C and 12 consecutive control biopsies of patients who underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy of focal lesions in otherwise healthy livers (mainly liver metastasis of carcinomas) were used for semiquantitative assessment of interferon alpha induced STATl activation using gel shift assays. We found a signhcant inhibition of STATl DNA binding in patients with chronic hepatitis C compared to controls. As in our previous work with HCV protein expression systems, STATl phosphorylation was not impaired in human liver biopsies from patients with hepatitis C. We conclude that interferon induced intracellular signaling can be analyzed semi-quantitatively in human liver biopsies ex vivo by gel shift assays. Using this newly validated method, we found that signaling is impaired in liver biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis C. The block in STAT signaling is at the level of DNA binding in the nucleus, whereas STAT activation at the interferon receptor functions normally. Methods We studied the intrahepatic and peripheral HCV-specific CDS+ T cell response in a cohort of 15 HLA-A2 positive chronically HCV infected patients by tetramer staining, intracel-M a r IFNgamma staining and CFSE labeling. In addition, viral amino acid sequences corresponding to the four CTL epitopes used in the study were deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis to assess the potential role of viral escape variants. Results (1) Substantial higher numbers of HCV specific CD8+ T cell responses were detectable in the liver compared to the peripheral blood, suggesting compartmentalization at the site of infection. In addition, intrahepatic CDS+ T cells were multispecific whereas peripheral HCV specific CDS+ 'I' cell responses were primarily monospecific. These results suggest, e.g., the persistence of HCV-specific T cells at the site of disease or the direct priming of T cells in the liver.",

Importantly, IFN gamma producing tetramer positive CD8+ T cells were only detectable in patients with low viral titers or in patients with high viral titers but with sequence variations in the corresponding viral epitope, suggesting viral escape. The relative contribution of T cell dysfunction versus viral escape to viral persistence is not known. It is important to note, however, that both mechanisms can operate within the same patient. Insulin resistance (IR) is a frequent feature in chronic hepatitis C while risk factors of steatosis are body mass index in patients infected with genotype 1 and viral load in those infected with genotype 3. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, we adressed the following issues: 1) is IR the cause or consequence of steatosis and fibrosis ? 2) what are the risk factors of IR ; 3) does IR play a role (and to what extent) in the occurrence of steatosis ? 4) is IR involved in the progression of fibrosis ? Therefore, this study was designed to assess relationships between IR, steatosis and fibrosis according to HCV genotypes in non diabetic patients. Methods: 152 non-diabetic patients with biopsy proven non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C had fasting serum glycemia and insulinemia measurements.

Prevalence of IR (HOMA higher than1.64) was significantly higher in genotype 1 patients with steatosis than that of other patients (77% vs 27,23 and 21% respectively, p=O.oOOl). IR was significantly associated with extensive fibrosis in genotype 1 patients (p=0.008) but not in genotype 3 patients. Among genotype 1 patients, independent parameters associated with IR were age (p=0.002) and steatosis (p=O.O3) but not fibrosis. Independent risk factors for steatosis in genotype 1 and genotype 3 patients were DR (p=O.O4) and viral load (p=0.02) respectively. Steatosis was associated with significantly higher fibrosis score whatever the genotype (p=O.O1). Among genotype 1 patients, the median progression rate of fibrosis was significantly higher in those having steatosis and IR together than in other patients (0.1 vs 0.05, p =0.02). Conclusions : In non-diabetic patients with non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C 1) steatosis and fibrosis are associated with IR in genotype 1 patients but not in genotype 3 patients, 2) among genotype 1 patients, IR mainly depends on age but not fibrosis 3) IR is a major risk factor of steatosis in genotype 1 patients, 4) the combination of steatosis and insulin resistance is a risk factor of fibrosis progression. These results suggest that IR is not the consequence but rather the cause of steatosis and fibrosis progression. . However, in the first month of life, in 4 of these 13 newborns, HCV RNA was only detected in PBMCs and not plasma. In 2 neonates, the SSCP band patterns of PBMC-derived viral sequences were different from maternal sequences in serum or PBMC; however, they were identical to HCV RNA negative strand amplified from mothers' PBMC. The latter strongly suggests that the infection was transmitted through maternal infected PBMCs. Another infant harbored different HCV strains in serum and PBMC; both strains were present in the mother's serum. Only 7 of 13 HCV-RNA positive children developed HCV antibody at one year. HIV infection was found in 2 out of 13 HCV RNA-positive and in 6 out the 35 HCV RNA-negative infants (NS). CONCLUSIONS: We have found that 1) HCV strains infecting neonates may be derived from strains residing in maternal PB-MCs. 2) HIV+ pregnant women who were HCV RNA positive in PBMCs were more likely to transmit HCV to their infants. These data suggest that one mechanism for perinatal transmission of HCV is maternal-fetal transfusion of HCV-infected PBMCs late in pregnancy or during labor and delivery. Additionally, HCV infected neonates may have a limited ability to develop HCV antibodies in the first year of life and thus there may be an underestimation of the prevalence of HCV infection by anti-HCV determination among children born to HCV RNA positive mothers. (HCC) in this clinical setting is very high. However, the molecular mechanisms of how HCV related proteins may contribute to HCC is not well defined. HCV core protein, a viral structural protein, has been implicated in tumor development. The goal of this study was to characterize the transcriptional regulation induced by core protein expression with respect to generations of a malignant phenotype. METH0DS:A cDNA fragment encoding HCV core protein of l b genotype was subcloned into the pTRE2hyg vector and co-transfected with pTet-On vector (Clontech) into a human Huh 7 hepatoma derived cell line using polyamine (Mirus) as a carrier. Stably transformed clones were selected by growth in culture medium containing G418 and hygromycin. Clones positive for HCV core protein expression were screened by immunoblotting from cells grown in the presence and absence of tetracycline. One clone with core expression tightly regulated by tetracycline was chosen for further analysis. Cell proliferation was evaluated by a modified MTT assay, at 6,12,24, 36 and 48 hours after induction of core protein expression. Twenty-four hrs after HCV core expression, the cellular transcriptional changes were analyzed by Microarray analysis using human Genome U133 Array Sets (Affymetrix). The microarray data were validated by real-time PCR on selected genes. RESULTS HCV core protein expression was tightly regulated by the presence of tetracycline and the protein levels were dependent on the amount of the tetracycline present in the culture medium. Core protein expressing cells showed significant increase in growth compared to non-expressing cells at 6,12, 24,36 and 48 hours after addition of tetracycline indicating a proliferation stimulus provided by core protein. Microarray analysis using human gene chip U133 revealed that 1072 of 39,000 genes were significantly changed (> 3 fold), with 626 up-and 446 down-regulated. This screen was quite informative since 52 genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation (38 genes) and apoptosis (14 genes) were changed respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced growth of liver-derived cells by HCV core protein is due to cellular transcriptional changes induced upon core expression; two major molecular pathway(s) are involved 1) those involved in celI growth control and 2) those involved in cell survival. Such gene regulation by HCV core protein is important to the molecular pathogenesis of HCC Daudi-CD4 cells were infected with pNL4-3, a T-tropic HIV molecular clone. 24 hours later, uninfected and HIV-infected cells were incubated with either 10% high titer HCV-positive patient serum, 10% HCV-negative patient serum, or 10% FBS (no human serum). Infections were continued for 3,4,5, and 6 days; cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide, fixed, and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Annexin V is a marker of early apoptosis, and propidium iodide indicates cell death either by apoptosis or necrosis. RESULTS: Six high titer HCV-positive sera and six HCV-negative sera were tested in five separate experiments, and in each case, the percentage of viable cells was higher in the HIVIHCV-coinfected cells compared to those infected with HIV only. To further elucidate dynamics of the course of coinfection, we did a time course consisting of harvests every eight hours beginning at Day 3 (the earliest point at which apoptosis had been observed in prior experiments) and continuing until Day 6 plus 16 hours. The results of the five harvests from Day 5 plus 8 hours to Day 6 plus 16 hours are shown in the figure below. The percentages of viable cells and those undergoing apoptosis are shown as measured by flow cytometry. During this 32-hour interval the percentage of viable (negative for apoptosis) cells fluctuated very little in untreated cells, or in cells incubated with HCV-positive serum, or even in HN-infected cells incubated with HCV-positive serum. In striking contrast, HIV-infected cells that were incubated with HCV-negative patient serum dropped to only 16% viability by the end of the 32 hours, compared to 64% viability in the HIV-infected cells incubated with HCV-positive patient serum. This effect was not observed when apoptosis was induced by either of two chemical inducers of apoptosis in Daudi cells: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand and calpain inhibitor 11. Next, we sought to determine if the effect of apoptosis inhibition was dependent on HCV particles. When H Ninfected cells were kept separate in culture from HCV-infected cells by a membrane that prevented virus passage, apoptosis in the HN-infected cells was still inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that in our experimental conditions: 1) HCV-positive sera, but not HCV-negative sera provide a protective effect to HIV-induced apoptosis in Daudi-CD4 cells, and 2) a cellular factor induced by the presence of HCV, rather than HCV particles themselves, is responsible for the inhibition. Methods: Serum and PBMC samples from an individual with acute HCV-infection (Genotype l a ) were collected every two to three months over a time period of 20 months beginning 2 months after infection. PCR amplification of vRNA using a set of overlapping primers for the entire HCV genome was performed and PCR-products population sequenced using an ABI automated sequencer. CD8+ T cell responses were defined using an IFNgamma ELISpot assay using an overlapping synthetic peptide set spanning the whole HCV-genome (Genotype la). Based on the HLA-type the complete viral genome was also screened for putative CDS+ epitopes using a web based epitope prediction program (SYFPEITHI). Results: ELISpot screening with the whole HCV-genome peptide set detected only two ex-vivo IFN-gamma responses (NS3 1073-1081 and NS5B 2594-2602), although neither epitope was associated with the development of mutations. However, over the 20 month period of observation we detected a total of 25 mutations throughout the genome (2 in El, 4 in E2,3 in NS2,5 in NS3, 2 in 353A NS4 and 9 in NS5), in addition to multiple changes in the hypervariable regions. Interestingly, only five of these mutations resided within known HLA-restricted optimal epitopes. However, 17/25 mutations (68%) were located within predicted epitopes based on known HLA-binding motifs of the subject. In order to begin to define the rate at which these mutations develop an intermediate time point of 12 months was also sequenced. Interestingly, 19/25 (76%) of the mutations had already occurred by this time. It is likely that at least some of these mutations are the direct result of immune pressure exerted through CD8+ T lymphocytes. We are currently generating peptide-specific CDS+ T cellines against these regions exhibiting viral evolution, providing an opportunity to determine which of these regions are associated with previously undescribed CD8+ responses. Conclusions: Hypothesizing that evolving mutations in HCV might be the result of immune pressure by CTL, longitudinal full length sequencing of HCV may represent a powerful tool to define additional HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, especially those exerting substantial selective pressure. Using this approach we were able to identify a number of candidate regions where CD8+ T cell responses may be present and driving viral evolution. Determining the extent to which viral escape from CD8+ responses occurs during HCV infection will elucidate its overall impact in preventing proper control of HCV. ",

It has been suggested that such therapy is efficacious due to enhanced activity of T cell responses, which are most active during acute disease.

Responses were confirmed by establishing peptide-specific T-cell lines and intracellular cytokine staining. The screening for HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses was repeated during and after therapy.

After the start of therapy, frequencies of HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells declined following suppression of HCV viremia. Therapy also did not increase the breadth of the HCV-specific response as no additional specificities were detected at later timepoints, when Elispot screening was repeated. In 5/8 subjects viral relapse occurred after therapy was stopped, with 2 subjects being retreated successfully. Relapse was not predicted by the presence or absence of HCV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. During viral relapse, a vigorous expansion of pre-existing HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells was observed for most specificities, with single responses reaching almost 3% of CD8+ T cells as measured by tetramer staining. These responses were unsuccessful in containing HCV. In the two subjects who were retreated after viral relapse, we observed the identical pattern of declining CD8+ T cell responses as in the first treatment course. In contrast to CD8+ T cell responses, CD4 proliferative responses usually became more vigorous after virus was suppressed on therapy. However, such responses also did not protect from viral relapse. Conclusions: These data suggest that although multispecific functional CD8+ T cell responses may be present during acute disease, this does not predict a successful outcome of antiviral therapy. Rather than boosting CD8+ T cell responses, therapy and viral suppression appear to lead to their attenuation, even though CD4+ T cell responses may be restored. Figure) in the fibrous septum of portal tract in cirrhotic liver. Significantly less Fltl immunopositivity occurred in ND liver. Hepatocytes were negative for Fltl. Conclusion: The greater DE of genes involved in immune activation, fibrosis, cellular proliferation and cell signalling indicated that these processes are more active in the cirrhotic liver that has developed HCC than the cirrhotic liver without HCC development. PLGFlFltl signalling has an important role in neo-vascular development within organs. The decreased expression of PLGF and its receptor Flt 1 in cirrhosis with HCC implies that vascular proliferative signals although normally active in cirrhosis itself may be decreased in cirrhotic livers with HCC. Prospective analysis of cirrhosis prior to HCC development is needed to indicate whether these findings represent a premalignant phenotype. BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often leads to chronic liver diseases including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). At least 10 HCV proteins have been identified, which serve as viral structural and non-structural proteins required for viral replication and virion formation. Several viral proteins have been implicated in HCV persistence and the development of HCC. We have previously reported that the NS2 protein inhibits gene expression f+om various cellular and viral promoters in liver and non-liver derived cells. Thus, expression of endogenous cellular proteins was significantly reduced in NS2 expressing cells. In this regard, the NS2 protein was recently found to be an inhibitor of the pro-apoptotic CIDE-B protein and therefore may contribute to hepatic oncogenesis. To understand the molecular basis of repressed gene expression, we constructed successive deletion mutants of the NS2 protein and tested their effect on luciferase expression driven by CMV promoter. METH-ODS: The cDNAs encoding the full-length (1-217), N-terminal part (1-91) and internal parts of NS2 were generated by PCR and cloned into the pCR3.1 vector for expression under control of the CMV promoter. A liver-derived Huh-7 cell line was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the luciferase reporter gene and plasmid encoding various deletion mutants of the NS2 gene. Inhibition of gene expression was measured by luciferase activity assay at day two after transfection.",

RESULTS: Deletion constructs 61-121, 61-111, 71-121 and 71-111 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on luciferase activity comparable to the fulllength NS2 protein, whereas the deletion constructs 81-111 and 81-121 lost the inhibitory effect. Therefore, the minimal amino acid residues required for the inhibition of gene expression by this viral non-structural protein was mapped to residues 71-111. Interestingly, this region partially overlaps with the binding site of the NS2 to a newly identified CIDE-B pro-apoptotic protein. IL12 plays an essential role in the antagonism of T helper 2 differentiation and in the induction of antiviral host defence. We postulated that genetically determined attenuation of IL12 production could provide a plausible immunological mechanism able to determine outcome of HCV infection and have investigated a recently described polymorphism in the IL12B gene. Methods: We have extracted genomic DNA from whole blood taken from 196 HCV antibody positive patients. 124 patients had chronic HCV with detectable HCV RNA and 72 had spontaneously resolved infection, testing HCV RNA negative on several occasions. Genotyping for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position (A16974C) on the ILl2B gene was performed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction digest. Maximal in-vitro IL-12 production by cultured mononuclear cells in response to SAC (Staph Aureus Cowan) stimulation was determined in 24 cases by ELISA. Results: Of the HCV RNA positive cases 81 (65%) were homozygous for the 'a' allele, 39 (31%) heterozygous 'ac'; and 4 (4%) were homozygous 'cc' whereas of the HCV RNA negative cases 36 (50%) were 'aa', 33 (46%) were 'ac'; and 3 (4%) were 'cc'. HCV RNA negative cases were significantly more likely to be heterozygous for lac' than HCV RNA positive cases (p=0.04).",

            "text": "Of the 24 patients studied for IL-12 production, 13 were genotype 'aa' and 11 'ac'. 13 were HCV RNA positive (8 genotype lac' and 3 'aa') and 11 HCV RNA negative (3 genotype 'aa' and 3 'ac'). Maximal IL-12 production with SAC stimulation was lower in the 11 genotype 'aa' cases (mean 104 units) than in the 13 genotype 'ac' cases (mean 228 units) (p= 0.08). HCV RNA positive cases produced significantly less IL-12 than did HCV RNA negative cases (mean 84 units compared to 266 units, p= 0.016). Comparison of HCV RNA positive or negative cases only, revealed a trend for higher maximal IL-12 production with genotype 'ac' regardless of HCV outcome. Conclusion: Cases heterozygous for the variant 'c' allele at position 16974 of the IL-12 p40 gene are significantly more likely to be HCV RNA negative than those homozygous for the 'a' allele. Recent data found carriage of the variant 'c' allele to be associated with greater IL-12 production capacity and our data from a small number of cases supports this. Genetically influenced enhancement of IL-12 production appears to be a factor influencing the outcome of HCV infection. We have previously demonstrated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein expression in Huh-7 hepatoma cells increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from mitochondria without inducing apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HCV core protein inhibits the ROSassociated apoptosis induced by deoxycholic acid (DCA). Methods:: We measured ROS level and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) content, and evaluated apoptosis in the presence or absence of DCA (500 pM), using a human hepatoma-derived cell line with tightly regulated HCV core protein expression under the control of a Tet-OffrM promoter. Cells were incubated with 5pM of chloromethyl2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for 30 min for measurement of ROS. Cellular 8-OHdG content was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fragmented nuclei were assessed with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindiole staining and DNA fragmentation was evaluated by genomic DNA laddering. The degree of apoptosis was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also examined whether the general caspase inhibitor (zVAD-FMK) inhibited the ROS-associated apoptosis induced by DCA. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 500wM of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in addition to DCA. The experiments were repeated 3 or 4 times. Results:: Strong core expression was detected 72 hours after withdrawal of tetracycline from the culture medium. The expression of core protein increased the basal ROS level (1.6 2 0.17-fold, P<0.05) and 8-OHdG content (1.13 i 0.005-f0ld, P<0.05) of Huh-71191-20 cells without inducing apoptosis. DCA stimulation produced a 4.0-fold increase in ROS content in the presence of core expression and a 2.5-fold increase in the absence of core expression. Similarly, the 8-OHdG content was significantly increased by DCA regardless of HCV core expression (1.13-fold, P=0.02 for core expression, 1.15-fold, P=O.O1 for core non-expression). Nevertheless, HCV core protein significantly suppressed the ROS-associated apoptosis induced by DCA (W0.05). Also apoptosis induced by DCA was almost completely inhibited by zVAD-FMK. UDCA significantly decreased the ROS (P<0.05) and the 8-OHdG content (P=O.OOS) in the core-expressing cells and attenuated DCA-induced apoptosis. On-treatment virological response (OTR) was defined as complete loss or greater than 100-fold drop in HCV viremia within 3-6 months of therapy by quantitative or qualitative RT-PCR (Roche Cobas Amplicor v2.0), based on recommended early virological testing for continued therapy. Forty-six patients with at least 3 months of continued antiviral therapy were examined thus far, including 30 with genotype 1 (Cl) and 16 with either genotypes 2 or 3 infection (C2). On-treatment response (OTR) was achieved in 29/46 (63%) patients overall, including 47% among C1 and 94% in C2 groups. Positive and negative control groups included 19 healthy HCV seropositive but nonviremic subjects without history of antiviral therapy (\"Recovered\") and 23 healthy HCV seronegative volunteers, respectively. HCV-specific CD4 T cell response was examined using recombinant HCV Core, NS3l4, NS5 and control proteins in standard proliferation and IFN-gamma (IFNg) Elispot assay at baseline (pre-treatment) and at 1, 3 andlor 6 months during antiviral therapy. Results: HCV-specific CD4 T cell response was significantly greater in the Recovered compared to the Chronic patients, consistent with its expected role in natural HCV clearance. Among the Chronics, C2 patients (genotype non-1) displayed a baseline T cell response to HCV NS3/4 that was modestly but significantly greater than C1 patients ( ",

            "text": "We identified several genes specifically involved in various stages of fibrosis. The dysregulated genes mainly encoded extracellular matrix proteases, growth factors, cytokineslchemokines, and IFNcu-induced genes. We also observed a statistically significant association between HCV RNA amount (as determined with the same real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology) and expression of several genes, mainly IFN-a-induced genes including STAT1, IFI27, MIX1, OAS2 and GIP2. Understanding the correlates of protective immunity in this setting is an important first step in the development of potential vaccine candidates. Methods: Two recipients of frozen patellar allograft tissue procured from the same donor developed evidence of acute HCV within 6 months of surgery. In retrospect, the donor was confirmed to be HCV antibody negative but HCV RNA positive (genotype la). Both patients were enrolled in a prospective study of T cell immunity requiring whole unit blood draw at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months. Comprehensive HCV-genomewide analyses were determined by IFN-y ELISPOT responses to 33 overlapping peptide pools that spanned the entire HCV polypeptide (genotype la, 3010 aa, total 750 peptides). Peptide responses were defined as greater than mean plus 3 SD compared to 10 control wells. Results: Patient 1 (51 yo WF) cleared the virus spontaneously within 6 months; when first evaluated, the pt. demonstrated CD4+ T cell responses to 8 of 33 (24%) peptide pools, with effector frequencies as high as 1 in 5,000 (to NS3helicase-7, amino acids 1569-1667). IFN-y CD8+ T cells were detected following stimulation with 6 of 33 (18%) pools (highest frequency to pool NS5B-5, aa 2829-2927). Remarkably, 6 months later, the repertoire of the HCV-specific CD4 t T cell response had expanded further, and patient 1 demonstrated responses to 13 of 33 (39%) pools. In contrast, patient 2 (49 yo WM) demonstrated persistent viremia (4.4 million copieslml, Bayer assay) and lacked CD4+ T cell responses to any peptide pools when first evaluated; only one peptide pool (NS3-helicase-5, aa 1369 -1478) elicited responses in CD8+ T cells. Despite virologic clearance with antiviral treatment (pegylated interferon and ribavirin), ELISPOT screening failed to reveal emergence of new CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses (6 months later). Conclusions: Comprehensive analyses of HCV-genome-wide CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses reveal significant differences in patients exposed to the same HCV innoculum and correlate with spontaneous clearance versus chronicity. In HCV infection that resolves spontaneously, the repertoire and strength of the HCV-specific immune response may continue to expand in the first year after infection (and may target more than one-third of the HCV polypeptide). In contrast, the profile of T cell responses remains narrow, weak, and constant in the acute infection that becomes chronic, even after successful antiviral therapy. Alcohol consumption exacerbates liver injury in chronic hepatitis C and enhanced oxidative stress is one possible pathophysiological mechanism. We have previously developed a hepatoma cell line with conditional, stable expression of HCV core protein and constitutive expression of CYP2E1. These cells demonstrate dosedependent ethanol toxicity when core protein is expressed. The AIMS of this study were to determine whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction are responsible for ethanol-induced cytoxicity. METHODS: Huh-7 cells with conditional expression of core protein and constitutive expression of CYP2E1 (L14 subclone) were exposed to 0.1 micromolar tBOOH and/or ethanol (25 mM) for up to 24 hrs. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay or trypan blue exclusion. ROS production was assayed with the oxidation sensitive fluorescent dye DCFDA. Mitochondria1 membrane potential was analyzed by flow cytometry using the dye JC-1 as a probe. Apoptosis was detected by cellular DNA content analysis with flow cytometry. RESULTS:",

Addition of 25 mM ethanol to core/ CYP2E1 expressing cells further increased cell death to 5326%. DNA content analysis and nuclear morphology showed that this type of cell death represented necrosis and not apoptosis. Effects on mitochondrial membrane potential were also examined. Under control conditions, only 250.5% of cells had depolarized mitochondria. Expression of corelCYP2El and exposure to tBOOH depolarized mitochondria in 47211% of cells. Similar to cell death, ethanol (25 mM) addition increased depolarization to 7027% of cells. Compared to control cells, core protein increased ROS by a factor of 1.220.3, and the combination corelCYP2El by 2.150.3. Furthermore, cells expressing corelCYP2El ampIified the effect of exogenous tBOOH. Incubation with tBOOH (0.1 pM) had no effect on ROS content of control cells.

The antioxidant also completely blocked both mitochondrial depolarization and cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: HCV core protein and CYP2El synergistically enhance ROS production in hepatoma cells, amplify the oxidative stress produced by extracellular ROS, and sensitize cells to mitochondrial depolarization and necrotic cell death caused by alcohol. Since all these effects are blocked by antioxidants, the formation of ROS is likely to be the primary event which subsequently produces mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. sponse associated with different outcomes of HCV infection may provide important insights into our understanding of HCV pathogenesis. For this purpose, we compared the functional features of HCV-specific CD8 cells in patients with chronic hepatitis C (23 patients, CH), chronic asymptomatic carriers of HCV with persistently normal ALT and positive serum HCV-RNA (12 patients, AS) and in subjects with resolved HCV infection, either spontaneously (8 subjects, SP) or following anti-viral treatment (12 subjects, RT). Functional analysis was carried out with 5 highly immunogenic peptides corresponding to NS31073-1081 , NS31406-1415 , NS41812-1821 , NS41992-2000 , NS52627-2635 , containing previously identified HLA-A2 restricted epitopes. Since the different HCV genotypes were represented in the different groups of patients in different proportions, different sets of peptides designed on genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3 sequences were synthesized and used to reproduce more closely the sequence of the viruses infecting each individual patient and responsible for in vivo priming of the CDS response. The immunological parameters tested were: a) frequency of HCV specific, CD8+ T cells by tetramer staining, both ex-vivo and after in vitro stimulation with synthetic peptides; b) IFN-7 production by intracellular cytokine staining; c) cytolytic activity by a standard %hromium release assay. The results of our study indicate that subjects recovered from HCV infection following treatment show lower ex-vivo frequencies of circulating HCV-specific CD8 cells compared to CH patients but their cells are able to expand and to produce IFN-7 more efficiently after in-vitro stimulation. Indeed, HCV-specific T cell lines were induced in 83% of RT subjects and in 74% of CH patients; moreover, IFN-7 production was induced in 100% of RT subjects compared to 67% of CH patients (p<0.05). In the group of subjects spontaneously recovered from infection, ex vivo CD8 frequencies were below the threshold of tetramer detection; however, peptide stimulation in vitro was able to expand tetramer+ CD8 cells and to induce IFN-7 production in 37% and 63% of the subjects, respectively. These lower levels of reactivity of SR subjects compared to TR patients are likely due to the different time elapsed from recovery, which was approximately 3 years in TR subjects but much longer in SP subjects, who had recovered even decades before the time of immunological analysis. Finally, the group of AS patients showed the lowest levels of response to HCV, in terms of both frequencies of HCV-specific circulating CD8 cells and cytokine secretion.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the HCV-specific, CD8-mediated response has different features in patients with different outcomes of infection, showing a hierarchy of efficiency declining from subjects recovered after treatment who displayed the best responses, to chronic hepatitis patients, subjects recovered spontaneously and asymptomatic HCV-carriers, who appear to be the least responsive as a likely result of a deeper condition of tolerance to HCV. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most frequent cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries and it has been involved in the development of cirrhosis with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Cyclooxygenases (COX) are crucial enzymes in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and COX-2, the inducible isoform, has been implicated in inflammation, fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. To address whether COX-2 may play a role in HCVrelated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, we determined the COX-2 expression pattern in the liver tissue from 27 patients with HCV-induced chronic hepatitis (low histological activity=22, high histological activity=5) and 5 with end-stage cirrhosis, searching for correlations between the expression level of this enzyme and the histological activity of liver disease as well as with the intrahepatic expression and activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs). We also investigated whether structural and non-structural HCV proteins may promote COX-2 expression in the human hepatocytederived cell line CCL13. Western-blot and RT-PCR analysis for COX-2 demonstrated that COX-2 expression levels were higher in mild chronic hepatitis (MCH, 2.6 fold), severe chronic hepatitis (SCH, 3 fold) and cirrhosis (2.4 fold) than in normal liver. Moreover, PGE2 levels were also higher in liver samples from patients with SCH (1.9 fold) and in those with cirrhosis (3.3 fold) than in normal liver. Besides other cell types, hepatocellular COX-2 immunoreactivity was markedly observed in HCV cirrhosis, and although some COX-2 positive hepatocytes were observed at the edge of hepatic lobules, the majority of them were mainly restricted to the regenerative nodules. In contrast, none or few COX-2 expressing hepatocytes located in periportal areas were observed in patients with MCH and SCH, respectively. Interestingly, we found a significant correlation between the intrahepatic expression and activity of COX-2 and MMP-2 and -9 in all the histological groups of patients analyzed. COX-2 mRNA, protein and activity was de novo induced in resting CCL13 cells stably transfected with HCV core and NS5A, and this effect was higher (1 fold and 2.5 fold) when activated with cytokines and phorbol esters, respectively. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that a virus-induced hepatocellular COX-2 upregulation could mediate important pathogenic events in the course of chronic HCV infection, suggesting that specific COX-2 inhibitors might be useful for chemoprevention and therapy of HCV-related liver disease. were nahe to HBV. Thl responses to HCV proteins NS3, NS4 and core were sought by ELIspot. As a control Thl responses were also sought to HBsAg, where results were analysed according to recovery from HBV infection or nayve to HBV. Thl responses to each of the 5 proteins was performed before and after depletion of T-regs using anti-CD25 (>80% depletion). Results: Following Treg depletion Thl responses were revealed de novo in 3/12 and enhanced in 8112 patients with NS3,2 and 9 with NS4 respectively and 4 and 7 with HCV core respectively. The overall increase in the Thl responses with T-reg depletion was significant for both HCV core (median increase 13-fold p = 0.004) and NS3 (5- Backaround: In both chronic viral hepatitis B and C viral persistence is thought to be due to an inadequate antiviral T cell response, which in turn may be caused by inappropriate priming of T cells by dendritic cells. An important subset of peripheral blood dendritic cells, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell, has been identified to be the major interferon-alpha producing cell in humans. Since both hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection can be successfully treated by exogenous interferon-alpha, an impairment of endogenous interferon-alpha producing cells is an attractive hypothesis for the pathogenesis of chronic viral persistence. Methods: Patients with acute symptomatic ( n = l l ) and chronic hepatitis C (n=25), sustained responders to interferon-alpha therapy (n=22) and patients with acute hepatitis B (n=lO) as well as healthy controls (n=20) were included in this study. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells were stained for FACS-analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with antibodies against BDCA-2 and CD4 and by exclusion of lineage marker positive cells (CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19). In addition pDC were stained with various activation and maturation markers (e.g. CDSO, CD83, CD86). Production of interferon-alpha was measured by ELISA after stimulation with CpG. Results: In acute hepatitis C, IFN-alpha production was about 45-fold reduced as compared to healthy controls (15 pg/50000 PBMC vs. 701 pg150000 PBMC). This reduction was caused by both a significant reduction in absolute numbers of pDC (3.8/~1 vs. 8.4/pl, p=0.0032) as well as by a reduction of IFN-alpha production per cell (0.19 pg/PDC vs. 3.45 pg/PDC; p=0.0004). In chronic hepatitis C, IFN-alpha production was still reduced by over 50%, although absolute numbers of pDC were similar to healthy controls. Following spontaneous or treatment induced viral clearance both number and IFN-alpha secretion of pDC were not different from healthy controls. Importantly, in acute hepatitis B, which runs a self-limited course in the majority of cases, also the IFN-alpha production was reduced (21 pg150000PBMC). This reduction was also caused by both the reduction of absolute PDC count (5.291~1, p=O.l) as well as by the IFN-alpha secretion per PDC (0.32 pg1PDC; p=0.0007). Using a panel of DC activation and maturation markers we did not find any evidence of a more immature or more activated phenotype of pDC in acute hepatitis C. Exogenous IFN-alpha administration during acute hepatitis C led to a further reduction of IFN-production by pDC. Conclusions: Acute viral hepatitis has a dramatic impact on frequency and function of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the peripheral blood, indicating that pDC play an important role during this phase of viral hepatitis. However, no differences were found between patients with self-limited vs. chronically evolving acute hepatitis C or patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B. Future studies have to clarify whether the reduced IFN-alpha secretion by pDC contributes to viral persistence or whether this is rather part of a physiological response to acute viral disease. It has been suggested that hepatocellular steatosis, a frequent histological feature of chronic hepatitis C, is more frequent in HCV genotype 3 infection, and disappearance of steatosis in patients who clear HCV genotype 3 infection after antiviral therapy suggests a possible direct role of this HCV genotype. In order to assess the direct causal role of HCV in steatosis, we studied the relationship between HCV RNA load and steatosis according to the HCV genotype. Methods: We studied 176 patients with chronic hepatitis C (genotype 1, n = 83 ; genotype 3, n = 93). The serum HCV RNA level was measured at the time of liver biopsy by means of a third-generation \"branched DNA\"-based assay (Versant HCV RNA 3.0 Quantitative Assay, Bayer Diagnostics). Steatosis was graded as absent, mild (< 10% of hepatocytes), moderate (10 to 30% of hepatocytes) or marked (> 30% of hepatocytes). Daily alcohol intake during the 6 months prior to liver biopsy, and the body mass index (BMI), were recorded. Results: Steatosis was more frequent in patients with genotype 3 infection than in those with genotype 1 infection (84.9% vs 74.7%, NS). Steatosis was significantly more severe in HCY genotype 3 than in genotype 1 infection (moderate or marked in 54.8% vs 25.3%, p=O.OOOl). In patients infected by genotype 3, the severity of steatosis was significantly related to HCV RNA load but not to alcohol intake or BMI. In contrast, in patients infected by HCV genotype 1, the severity of steatosis was not related to the HCV RNA level but was significantly influenced by alcohol intake and BMI. Bivariate analysis demonstrated the effect of the HCV genotype on the association between the severity of steatosis and viral load in genotype 3-infected patients, and between the severity of steatosis and exogenous metabolic factors in genotype 1-infected patients. Multivariate analysis showed that : (i, in patients infected by HCV genotype 3, only HCV RNA load was independently related to the severity of steatosis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-4.4; p = 0.001), (ii) in patients infected by HCV genotype 1, BMI higher than 28.0 kglm2 (OR = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.3-26.9; p = 0.016), alcohol intake exceeding 30 glday (OR = 29.6, 95% CI: 3.2-272.0; p = 0.009), and histological grade (OR = 20.0, 95% CI: 2.6-152.0; p = 0.001) were independently related to the severity of steatosis. Conclusion: Our results suggest : (i) steatosis is a cytopathic lesion induced by HCV genotype 3 ; (ii) HCV genotype 1 is not steatogenic per se or at the usual in vivo expression levels, and liver steatosis is a feature of associated steatohepatitis in these patients. The effect of HCV genotype 3 sequences and the role of their expression levc4s must be tested in vitro, in order to better reflect the in vivo situation. In animal models, steatosis is associated with oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation which is known to promote fibrogenesis. This study was aimed to assess in patients with chronic hepatitis C whether steatosis contributes to fibrosis through oxidative stress. Methods: Markers of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status were measured in blood from 192 chronic hepatitis C patients and age and sex matched healthy controls. Intrahepatic levels of these markers were also assessed in a subgroup of 23 patients and controls.",

The patient with acute liver failure did not have pre-transplant serum specimen stored. Twelve patients had developed smooth muscle andlor antinuclear antibodies, two anti-liver kidney microsomal (one atypical) and two anti-mitochondria1 antibody. Before transplantation, anti-SLA was negative in 13/15 cases, the two positive patients having cryptogenic cirrhosis and biliary atresia. Post transplant, anti-SLA remained positive in these two and became positive in further 9 patients. Of these, in 7 patients anti-SLA became positive at a median of 17 months (range: 1-115) before the clinical diagnosis of dn-AIH. In 5 children anti-SLA became detectable as early as 2 months post-surgery. In 6 patients anti-SLA levels were highest at the time of the clinical diagnosis of dn-AIH.",

The average MELD among cases was 25.9, compared to 24.1 in controls (p =0.19, NS). Overall LOS was similar in the two groups. However, pre-LT LOS, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU), was significantly higher in the pre-MELD or control group. The pre-LT cost was also higher in this group(p=0.05), translating into significantly higher total costs of LT in the pre-MELD period (p=O.Ol). The need for post-LT HD, PMV and pressors was no different between the two groups. This data is summarized in table 1. The MELD score was found to be significantly correlated with ",

            "text": "Bile d u d damage is a maior feature in liver graft rejection. Ductopenia (DP), defined as loss of more than 50%-of bile ducts, is a major hallmark of chronic liver graft rejection (CR), which usually leads to graft failure within the first post transplant year. In a previous study we have shown that in patients who developed DP and CR a deficient proliferative response of canals of Hering (CoH) was present in the preceding biopsies showing acute rejection (AR) when compared with a control group who experienced AR but did not progress to CR. These findings support the postulation that CoH represent a regenerative compartment of the biliary unit in the liver. Aim of the present studv: to analyze whether preservation of CoH might contribute to the reversibility of DP. Patients and Methods We studied 2 groups of patients. The index group (IG, n=5) developed loss of bile ducts without progression to graft failure due to CR during a follow up of 5 years after transplantation. The second group (CRG, n=12) were all CR patients, retransplanted at a median time of 7 months (range 2-19 months). Reperfusion (RB), 1 week (1-W), 1 month (1-M) biopsies were studied in both groups. In the CRG the last biopsies (LB) before retransplantation taken at a median time of 160 days (range 42-329 days) were also studied. Additionally, in the IG the 1& (1-Y), 2nd (2-Y) and 5* (5-Y) annual biopsies were also included. Bile ducts and CoH were identified by immunohistology using cytokeratin 7. Ki67 (MIB) was applied to investigate the proliferative activity. The number of bile ducts and CoH were counted per portal tract and the number of K67+ cells was counted as ratio of the total number of cells in these structures. Clinical follow-up of the IG group was studied based on liver function tests at similar time points as the biopsies.",

            "text": "The IG group showed damaged bile ducts and decreasing numbers of bile ducts in the course of time, leading to DP at a median of 3 years. Contrastingly, the CRG developed DP at a median time of 160 days, observed in the last biopsies taken before retransplantation. When compared with the CRG, the IG showed significantly less proliferative activity in bile ducts at 1-W (p=O.O43) but not in RB, 1-M and 1-Y, the latter was compared with the LB of the CRG. CoH showed an initial increase at 1-W in the IG, but a progressive decrease in the subsequent biopsies, reaching significant loss at 5-Y (p=0.043). In the CRG, progressive loss of CoH started at 1-W, leading to a significant loss within 1 year. Numbers of CoH were consistently lower in the CRG at all time points except RB, although not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in proliferative activity both within the IG in the course of time and when compared with CRG. All IG patients continuously showed abnormal liver function tests apart from the bilirubin levels, which were elevated during the first month after transplantation but were normal after 1-Y. At 5-Y, median serum level of alkaline phosphatase was 228 U/l, gamma glutamyl transpherase was 312 Ull, bilirubin was 26 micromoll1 and ASATlALAT were 96193 Ull. Conclusion: The IG showed a much slower course of loss of bile ducts when compared with CRG, leading to graft survival of more than 5 years. A higher proliferative activity in bile ducts at 1 week in the CRG did not prevent the progressive development of DPlCR in CRG. The initial increase of CoH at 1 week in the IG might be responsible for the prolonged preservation of CoH in the IG. As CoH are believed to represent a regenerative compartment of the biliary unit, our findings indicated that prolonged preservation of CoH might contribute to the delayed occurrence of DP but apparently not to reversibility of DP. Absence of reversibility of DP is supported by the abnormal liver function tests. (LTx) . Recurrent HCV poses a significant and possibly increasing threat to graft and patient survival. Diagnosis of acute rejection and alterations in immunosuppression (IS) may significantly impact the tempo of post-tx HCV. These associations motivated us to re-examine risk factors for early acute rejection (EAR) in a large and contemporary cohort of LTx recipients. Methods: The study cohort comprised of 282 consecutive adults undergoing primary LTx between 1/1/99 and 10/31/2002 for chronic liver disease with a minimum of 7 day graft and patient survival. Recipients received triple IS, typically with steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. EAR was defined as biopsyproven rejection or treatment for presumed rejection within 6 months of LTx. Risk factors for EAR were determined by Cox proportional hazard methods. Spearman rank and phi correlations were used to determine associations between factors. Results: 177 men (63%) and 105 women (37%) underwent deceased (n = 236; 84%) or living donor (n = 46; 16%) LTx. The etiologies of chronic liver disease were HCV (n=138; 49%), AIH I PBC / PSC (n=40; 14%), HBV (n= 34; 12%), cryptogenic (n=27; lo%), alcohol (n=24; 9%), and miscellaneous (n=19; 7%). Our overall incidence of EAR was 45% (126 I282 recipients); 118 recipients (94%) had biopsy-proven rejection while 8 recipients (6%) were treated for rejection without histologic confirmation. Cox univariate models showed that HCV, female gender, MELD 2 28, year 2000 compared to year 1999, and lower day 5-7 tacrolimus (TAC d5-7) level were positively associated with EAR while Asian compared to Caucasian ethnicity was negatively associated with EAR (Table  la) . Factors such as recipient and donor age, recipient African American or Hispanic ethnicities, donor type (deceased or living), other years (2001 and 2002) , Child's score and class, pre-LTx ICU location, and cold and warm ischemia times were not significant risk factors. Cox multivariate models showed that HCV diagnosis and female gender remained independent and significant risk factors for EAR (Table lb) . HBV etiology and Asian ethnicity were significantly correlated (phi coefficient 0.53; p = <0.0001) and thus, did not remain independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. While lower tacrolimus level tended to predispose to EAR, MELD 2 28 and year 2000 were no longer associated with EAR. Lower tacrolimus level was significantly correlated with both higher MELD score (Spearman rank correlation -0.34; p = 0.0000) and later transplant year (Spearman rank correlation -0.17; p = 0.019). Conclusions: HCV etiology of liver disease is strongly associated with EAR after LTx. Risk of EAR is higher for HCV than EtOH, cryptogenic, and HBV etiologies and comparable to AIH / PSC I PBC etiologies; this effect is independent of gender, ethnicity, year, MELD, and post-LTx IS. Recipients with high MELD scores are also at increased risk for EAR, at least partly because of lower post-LTx IS. It is unclear whether the strong association of HCV etiology with EAR is because HCV infection results in an immunologic environment predisposing to EAR or whether we are unable to accurately diagnose rejection in the setting of HCV recurrence. Aim: Although the donor pool has expanded in response to increasing waiting lists the quality of donor livers has suffered as a result. It remains unclear whether such marginal organs can be safely used in high-risk recipients or whether they should be implanted solely into good recipients. We aimed to define recipient selection criteria for implantation of these grafts. Methods: A prospectively collected database containing 397 patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation between 1994 and 2002 was analysed. Donors were scored using a formula derived by logistic regression that identified 3 covariates (graft steatosis, donor age and cold ischaemia time) that independently correlated with primary graft dysfunction. This enabled them to be stratified into either marginal or non-marginal groups. Using logistic regression analysis, recipient factors independently correlated with 1-year post transplant survival in the marginal group (recipient age, plasma albumin and urea) were built into a mathematical model and each patient was given a score accordingly. Patients with scores higher than the defined optimum cut-off value were considered as high-risk and the others with lower scores as low-risk recipients. Outcomes were then evaluated in these subpopulations Results: Marginal and non-marginal donor groups consisted of 65 and 332 patients respectively. The recipient score derived from the multivariate analysis was as follows : Score = 1.989 x plasma albumin+ 1.22 x age group + 2.076 x urea, with the recipient albumin level coded as 1 for < 3.1 gldl and 0 for 2 3.1 gldl, the recipient age group coded as 2 for > 55 years, as 1 for 43-55 years, and as 0 for 22.4 mgldl, and as 0 for 5 22.4 mgldl. The ROC curve analysis showed that the score had a good discriminating power (area under the curve 0.78, p =.001) and the ideal cut-off value demarcating high-risk from low-risk recipients was 3.25.",

PurposelMethods: To identify potential mechanisms, 31 pediatric liver recipients, median age 7.8 years, median followup 8 months, received pre-and post-transplant measurements of 1. whole blood concentrations of Tacrolimus (TAC), 2. interdose changes in mitogen-stimulated T-and B-cell responses (sLR), 3. dendritic cell (DC),and peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets, and 4. CD8+28-suppressor effect on donor antigenpresenting cell types (CD34fmonocytes and CD19+ B-cells). All patients received rATG preconditioning with a total dose of 5 mglkg in two divided doses. The first dose was given before liver transplantation (LTx). Maintenance agent was TAC without steroids. In 9 patients this was replaced with Sirolimus (SRL). Mitogen-stimulated T and B-cell responses were compared with those seen in a historical population, who had not received rATG pretreatment. Results: All measurements were performed at a median interval of 47 days (22-57 days) after LTx. 1. In sLR, the frequency of T-cells expressing the cytokines IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2 decreased with increasing total exposure (AUC) to TAC in historical controls (n=6). This relationship was markedly dampened in rATG patients (n=15), as suggested by slopes of 0.0023, 0.032, and 0.0006 relating IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-2 on the y-axis to TAC AUC. 2. Significant decrease in CD4 absolute counts at 1 week and partial reconstitution at 2 months after rATG pretreatment (mean pretx-3120 vs 1 week-1920 vs month 2-2117 celllmm3). During this period, monocytes and B-cells remained stable. 3. DC2 remained unchanged, while DC1 frequency increased significantly, from 0.15 to 0.23, p=0.05. 3. In coculture experiments, purified CD8+28-subpopulations from two recipients receiving minimal TAC doses induced decreased CD86 expression in donor APC, but increased its expression in HLA-mismatched APC. Eleven of 31 subjects experienced rejection, while 18 subjects are being maintained on daily (n=13) or every other day (n=5) doses of TAC or SRL. Conclusions: Despite lymphocyte depletion, rejection in the setting of T-cell anergy can be explained by relative sparing of antigen-presenting cells, which can recruit alternative effector mediators. The appearance of donor-specific CD8 + suppressor cells in recipients on low immunosuppression suggests that these conditions may also foster a favorable immunomodulatory response toward the liver allografts. (dropout) . The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the HCC-adjusted Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) organ allocation scheme on the intention-to-treat outcome. Under the MELD scheme, patients with HCC meeting the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) T1 (single lesion under 2 cm) and T2 (single lesion between 2 to 5 cm, or 2 to 3 lesions none exceeding 3 cm) criteria were eligible for an initial MELD priority score of 24 and 29, respectively. They were also entitled to an increase in MELD score, corresponding to a 10% increase in mortality, for every 3 months on the waiting list. METHODS: Excluding patients undergoing living-donor liver transplantation, we prospectively evaluated 102 consecutive patients with HCC listed for OLT since January 1998. The Kaplan-Meier probabilities of OLT and dropout among 44 patients with HCC listed under the MELD system between February 2002 and January 2003 were compared with 58 patients listed between January 1998 and January 2002 under the previous system of organ allocation. Follow-up in the pre-MELD group was censored on February 27,2002, when the MELD system for organ allocation was implemented by UNOS. For patients under MELD, follow-up was censored on February 27,2003, when further refinements of the MELD policy for HCC were made. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Eighteen of 44 patients (41%) in the MELD group and 26 of 58 patients (45%) in the pre-MELD group received chemoembolization or various ablation treatments before OLT (p=0.89). All patients in the MELD group met T1 (5 patients) or T2 criteria (39 patients). In the pre-MELD group, 6 patients had HCC stage exceeding T2 but meeting our proposed expanded criteria (single lesion not exceeding 6.5 cm or no more than 3 lesions none greater than 4.5 cm with total tumor diameter not exceeding 8 cm) by the time of OLT. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative probabilities for OLT at 3, 6, and 8.5 months of longest followup were 22.5%, 64.0% and 88.0%, respectively, in the MELD group, versus 17.2%, 24.7%, 35.8%, and 47.2% at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively, in the pre-MELD group (p=0.0006). Under MELD, none of the 5 patients with T1 lesion had received OLT. The cumulative probabilities for OLT for the 39 patients with T2 HCC in the MELD group were 25.5%, 69.2%, and 89.2%, respectively at 3, 6, and 8.5 months (p=O.OOOl versus the pre-MELD group). The cumulative probability of dropout was 5.6% at 8.5 months of longest followup without OLT under MELD, whereas the cumulative probability of dropout increased from 7.2% at 6 months to 37.8% at 12 months in the pre-MELD era. The difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.74) largely due to low dropout rates in the first 6 months for both groups. Among the patients who received OLT, 3 of 22 patients in the MELD group versus 9 of 25 patients in the pre-MELD group had pathologic HCC stage in the explant exceeding T2 criteria (p=0.78). Unfavorable histologic tumor features in the explant, including either poorly differentiated grade or microvascular invasion or both, were observed in 4 of 22 patients in the MELD group versus 5 of 25 patients in the pre-MELD group ( I \" 1.0). The short duration of follow-up under MELD precluded comparison of intention-totreat survival or HCC recurrence between the two groups. CON-CLUSION: The HCC-adjusted MELD system significantly improved the probability of timely OLT, and was not associated with selection of a greater proportion of HCC with unfavorable explant tumor histology. Given the low probabilities for dropout in the first 6 months following listing for OLT even in the pre-MELD era, patients with HCC might have indeed received too high a priority score in the first year under MELD.

Results : 193 patients were recruited and a total of 174 were randomized at D7 (group 1 = 90, group = M). There was no difference between the 2 groups for baseline characteristics, proportion of patients with hepatitis C (18.9% and 20.2%), or cyclosporine blood levels. The incidence of treated biopsy confirmed acute rejection at 6 months was 24.4% in group 1 and 38.1% in group 2 (p= 0.03), with a trend for higher incidence of grade 213 rejection ( 18.9% vs 28.6% ; p=0.12). This difference was maintained in HCV pos and HCV neg patients. No difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of adverse events, infections, incidence of hypertension and renal dysfunction. Changes from baseline were similar with regards to metabolic parameters. A trend towards a better glucose tolerability was observed, less patients receiving an antidiabetic treatment in the placebo group ( 2 vs 10). Conclusion : peritransplant immunosuppression with basiliximab, cyclosporine microemulsion, and steroids resulted in excellent low rejection rates in LT patients. Early steroid withdrawl strategy at day 14 is not supported by the results of this study, which showed an higher incidence of acute rejection and a trend to more severe acute rejection, only balanced by a trend to a lower need of antidiabetic treatment. To determine if an association exists between MELD score and post transplant graft loss within 3 months. METHODS From 2/28/02 through 10/31/02,2,745 patients underwent liver transplantation, 92% of whom were followed for a minimum of three months. Cox regression analysis was utilized to assess the relationship between MELD score and post transplant outcome. transplantation. Seventy one percent of patients were positive for autoantibodies: 52.9 % were positive for anti-nuclear antibody, 23.5% for anti-smooth muscle antibody and 0% for anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody. The average ALT elevation was 224 (range 61-486) and AST elevation 166 (range 52-346). An elevated GGTP was seen in 70.6% of patients. All patients were Hepatitis C PCR negative. At the time of diagnosis, 12 patients were being treated with cyclosporine, 5 with F'K506, and 7 with steroids in addition to calcineurin inhibitors. After diagnosis, all patients received standard therapy with l-Zmg/kg of steroids. In addition, 89% (15117) began hthioprine and 24% had their calcineurin inhibitor dose decreased. After a mean of 2.6 years of follow-up (range 0.53-5.93), 59% remain steroid dependent and 12% are off steroids. One patient was re-transplanted for biliary complications and 1 patient required conversion to Sirohus. Conclusion: Diagnosis of de novo AM requires a high index of suspicion as auto-antibodies are often negative. Steroid therapy, often with the addition of azathioprine, is effective in controlling disease. Many patients, however, become steroid dependent in order to remain in remission. Background. Liver allografts have an improved outcome compared with other solid organ grafts, and rodent studies have suggested that activation-associated lymphocyte death may play a key role. Studies from our laboratory have shown increased levels of apoptotic lymphocytes in human liver grafts compared with renal grafts and native liver. Although the levels of apoptosis did not differ significantly between those who developed acute rejection (REJ) and those who did not (NR), the earliest timepoint studied was 3 days post-OLT. We hypothesized that the very early postoperative period (within 48 hours) would reveal a relationship between leukocyte apoptosis and rejection.",

Interestingly, the level of chimerism 5 hrs postreperfusion (Day 0) was significantly higher in NR (3.8% f 0.6) compared with REJ (1.2% t-0.4, p=0.004) and there was a close correlation between chimerism on Day 0 and PBMC cytokine expression on Day 1 (r=0.58, p=0.006). Conclusions. Patients who did not experience rejection had a paradoxical increase in markers of lymphocyte activation at Day 1, in association with higher levels of leukocyte apoptosis. This suggests that recipient cell death may have a role in graft acceptance and reduced acute rejection in human OLT. The higher donor cell chimerism seen in Non-Rejectors implicates the passenger leukocytes in the process of heightened cell death. Disclosures:",

The conventional use of heavy immunosuppression may depress the initial step of donor-specific activation to the extent that the treatment is anti-tolerogenic. To avoid this pitfall, we have applied 2 therapeutic principles in management of 78 adults cadaveric liver recipients transplanted between 9/2002-5/2003. The treatment principles were, first, host conditioning prior to transplantation, and second, minimum post-transplant immunosuppression. The host conditioning was done with one gram of methylprednisolon and a single infusion of 30 mg of alemtuzumab, completed before liver revascularization. There were 49 males and 29 females in the group with mean age 52.3110.3 years (32-73). Main causes of liver disease were hepatitis C (40%), cholestatic liver disease (18%), alcoholic liver disease (22%). Daily post-transplant monotherapy with tacrolimus (trough target 10 ng/ml) was started 12-24 hours postoperatively (starting tacrolimus dose: 10.5+5 mg, median 10). Because of suspected neurotoxicity, 5 patients were switched to cyclosporin. In addition sirolimus monotherapy was substituted for tacrolimus in one patient for management of nephrotoxicity. Immune activation diagnosed by liver function tests or by mild or equivocal rejection in liver biopsies frequently was not treated, and tended to resolve spontaneously. Clinically and pathologically significant rejection was treated with a bolus of methylprednisolone and/or a 30 mg dose of alemtuzumab. Nine patients (11.5%) died 5 sepsis; 2 PNF; one coagulation disorder (hypercoagulable state), and one congestive heart failure. Of the 69 surviving recipients four experienced rejection during the first two months which was readily reversed with a bolus of methylprednisolon. After demonstrating the absence of immune activation in liver biopsies at 120 days post-transplantation, weaning from monotherapy was initiated in 49 patients (with the aim of completely stopping treatment in selected cases). Seven patients experienced one episode of rejection that was reversed with single dose of methylprednisolone and/or infusion of 30 mg of alemtuzumab. Presently, 14 patients are on once a day monotherapy, 14 patients on every-other-day, 10 patients on three timedweek, 10 patients on twicelweek and one patient on once-a-week immunosuppressive regimen (latest tacrolimus dose 5.7t3.5 mg, median 5.5). The patients on cyclosporin and sirolimus are also following the same stepwise weaning pattern. No cases of new onset diabetes, renal failure or hypertension was found in these patients. Mean serum creatinine level in the study group at the time of transplantation was 1.020.4 mgldl and at the latest follow up 1.220.3 mgldl. CMV infection was seen in 22% of the patient population but was easily treatable with antivirals. No PTLD was seen during the follow-up period. Hepatitis C recurrence was seen in over 70% of the patients. Response to anti-HCV therapy in this group, after reduction of immunosuppression and especially during the weaning process was promissing. Conclusion: By applying the principles of immunosuppression outlined above, it has been possible to drastically reduce the amount of total immunosuppression relative to any (of our) pre-vious experience with liver transplantation. To see less side effects of chronic and high dose immunosuppressive therapy, and probably to have a chance to get a better response to treatment in our hepatitis C population. The results suggest the possibility of systematically achieving drug-free tolerance after liver transplantation. Background:End stage liver disease as a consequence of hepatic sarcoidosis is an uncommon indication for liver transplantation (LT). Consequently, there is a paucity of information on the pre-LT findings and postoperative course of individuals transplanted for hepatic sarcoidosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience with LT for sarcoidosis. Methods: Cases were identified by review of the Mount Sinai Hospital LT database. Patient records were reviewed; including the pathologic analysis of the hepatic explant, to confirm that sarcoidosis was responsible for liver failure. For each case, two control patients with other causes of liver failure matched for age, gender and date of transplant were selected. Data collected encompassed a mean follow up period of 5 years (range 1-8 years) post-LT. Two-tailed Student's t-test was used for comparison of continuous data, two-tailed Fisher's exact test for comparison of categorical data and log rank test for comparison of survival d,ita. Results: Hepatic sarcoidosis was the indication for LT in 7 of 2016 adult-LT (0.3%) performed from September 1988 -June 200.3. The mean age at transplant was 56 years and 4/7 (57%) were males. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was established by findings of extensive, non-caseating granulomas in pre-LT biopsy specimens or in the native liver explant. In 2/7 cases, sarcoid had been previously diagnosed by biopsies of lung parenchyma or mediastinal lymph node. 6 of 7 patients were AMA negative. The sole exception was a patient with an AMA titer of 1:320 in whom sarcoid was still considered the most likely diagnosis based on liver biopsy findings of granulomas present in both portal and lobular areas and granulomas in a lung biopsy performed 10-years prior to LT. Extrahepatic disease was limited to pulmonary involvement in 4 patients with radiographic findings of either interstitial infiltrates (2) or interstitial infiltrates and hilar adenopathy (2). The mean age at transplant and gender distribution were identical in cases and controls. The indications for LT in the control group were: hepatitis C (7), PBC (2) and one patient each with hereditary hemochromatosis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hepatitis B and Laennec cirrhosis. No statistically significant differences between the groups were present with respect to pre-LT levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, serum creatinine or prothrombin time. Cases and controls had a similar prevalence of ascites and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. In contrast, sarcoid cases were much more likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (100% vs. 21%, p=.002) and less likely to have antibodies to hepatitis C (0% vs. 50%, p=.05). Standard orthotopic LT was performed (two control patients received right trisegment grafts). Rates of acute cellular rejection were 71% in cases and 43% in controls (p=O.44) with cases experiencing a greater number of acute rejection episodes per patient (1.9 vs. 0.6 episodeslpatient). De novo autoimmune hepatitis developed in one case and one control patient. Both de novo autoimmune hepatitis and chronic rejection developed in one case patient. Recurrence of hepatic sarcoidosis was diagnosed in two patients at 1.5 and 5.6 years of follow-up. Among cases, the one-year graft and patient survival rates were 100% and five-year graft and patient survival rates were 86%. There was no statistically significant difference in five-year graft or patient survival between cases and controls. Conclusions: End-stage liver disease as a consequence of sarcoidosis is a rare indication for LT. These patients share many features in common with those transplanted for other indications. Despite the small number of patients, a relatively high rate of acute rejection and de novo autoimmune hepatitis was observed in patients with sarcoidosis. Recurrence of hepatic sarcoidosis was observed.",

James D Eason, Ari J Cohen, Safheesh Nair, George Loss, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA Sirolimus has been used successfully in improving renal function in OLT recipients previously treated with tacrolimus and steroids. We report our experience with early sirolimus conversion in steroid-free OLT recipients to determine safety and efficacy in patients never treated with steroids. Methods: We performed 220 OLT over a threeyear period. Steroid-free immunosuppression with rabbit ATG induction and tacrolimus and MMF was used in 140 of these patients. Twenty-five of these steroid-free recipients were converted from tacrolimus to sirolimus within one week to ll months of transplant. Results of these patients receiving sirolimus conversion were reviewed. Results: Renal insufficiency was the reason for conversion in18 patients, while seven patients were converted because of neurotoxicity. Six patients were dialysis-dependent at the time of conversion. One-year patient survival in this high-risk group was 80% (20/25) compared to 88% in patients who remained on tacrolimus. The four deaths were in patients converted because of renal failure, three of whom were on dialysis. The incidence of rejection was 31% in sirolimus patients compared to 24% in patients who remained on tacrolimus. Rejection was treated by the addition of MMF or reintroduction of low-dose tacrolimus. Only one patient required steroids to reverse rejection.

Archived pre-and postreperfusion donor liver biopsies were examined by electron microscopy in 9 patients with PNF and in 9 matched controls. Each PNF case was matched by donor age t5years, gender, cold ischemic time klhour and the donor's cause of death. All biopsies were blindly reviewed by the same pathologist. Particular attention was paid to abnormalities of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and sinusoidal endothelial cells. In addition, the glycogen content of the cells was also assessed. The recipient age and creatinine, as well as the donor serum peak transaminases and bilirubin were compared.Non parametric tests with p values <0.05 were regarded as significant using the SPSS 11.5 program. Results: Overall, patients with PNF were older (55.7 t 10 vs. 48.99 years, p=0.03) and had higher peak ALT levels (141 ? 185 vs. 40 2 32 U/L, p=0.04). There was no significant difference in recipient peak serum creatinine, donor peak serum AST, sodium or donor peak serum bilirubin. In all cases, the endoplasmic reticulum and sinusoidal endothelial cells were ultrastructurally normal. The hepatocytes had variable degrees of glycogen pooling and moderate to severe fatty infiltration. In 7/9 (78%) PNF cases vs. 2lY (22%) control had intramitochondrial crystalline inclusions on pre-perfusion biopsy. Conclusion: Liver allografts from patients with primary non-function have significant mitochondria1 ultrastructural changes on pre-perfusion biopsies, and may thus have some intrinsic mitochondria abnormalities. Introduction: The ideal liver allocation system would allocate donated livers to patients who are most likeIy to die without a transplant, but who have the lowest predicted mortality once they have been transplanted. This mode of allocation assesses the condition of both the recipient and the donor at the time of transplantation. In this study we have constructed a self-organising map (SOM: this is a neural network or non-linear mode of decision analysis suitable for modelling complex multidimensional relationships) and then validated it by using the SOM to classify survival in an unrelated population. Patients and Methods: We have previously described a SOM consisting of 72 (50 recipient and 22 donor) factors (inputs) constructed from 827 (449 male; median age 52 years; median MELD score 16) consecutive primary liver transplants undertaken between 01/01/1993 and 31/07/2002 in The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. Using a 3 neuron version of this SOM with three output functions (patient survival at 3 months; 1 year and 5 years) we used the SOM to classify the post-transplant survival of all primary graft recipients (n=200 patients) over a 5 year period from a North American centre (125 male; median age 48 years; median MELD score 16). The Birmingham (UK) patients were first classified by the SOM and then the probabilities of survival (p,) at 3 months, 1 year and 5 years calculated by dividing the number of surviving patients by the total number of patients in neuron i. Using this SOM, each of the Wisconsin (US) patients was classified to each of the neurons and the distribution of survival probes for each neuron compared between the two populations using the chi squared test. Results: There was no significant difference in the survival probabilities of patients in each neuron when the Wisconsin population was compared with the Birmingham population. Thus, the Birmingham SOM was able to classify successfully the survival of the Wisconsin patient population at 3 months, 1 year and 5 years following transplantation by using the same donor and recipient factors ( Table 1) . Analysis of the inter-neuronal survival probabilities demonstrated that for 3 month and 1 year survival, neuron 3 was associated with a significantly lower survival probability than neurons 1 and 2 (p=0.006 for 3 months; p= 0.006 for 12 months). Further, if recipients from neuron 1 received livers from patients classified to neuron 3 by \"computer simulated transplantation\", a proportion of patients then had a lower predicted survival probability (by SOM re-distribution to neuron 3). This analysis indicates that patient survival post-transplantation is significantly infuenced by both the condition of the recipient and donor factors at the time of transplantation. Conclusions: (1)SOM analysis provides an efficient and automated method for assessing the probability of survival of individual patients in an unrelated population at 3 months, 1 year and 5 years following liver transplantation.",

Purpose of study: To assess the efficacy of targeted prophylaxis in patients identified to be at highest risk of IF1 after orthotopic liver transplantation. Introduction: Historically, invasive fungal infection (In) has complicated up to 20% of cases of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Retrospective analysis has identified a variety of risk factors associated with a high risk for the subsequent development of IFI. These include patients undergoing retransplantation, transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), requiring haemodialysis and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Prophylactic anti-fungal therapy is safe and can reduce the incidence of IFl in OLT recipientri. In recent years our unit has moved towards targeting prophylaxis to higher risk transplants. We assessed the efficacy of our policy in reducing the incidence of invasive fungal infection.",

Standard treatment of rejection was 1 g iv daily of methylprednisolone x 3 days. Results: Absence of rejection over 3 months was in 69 (15%), mild in 103 (21%) and moderatelsevere in 277 (62%). In the first biopsy: absence of rejection in 92 (21%), mild in 178 (39%), moderate in 159 (35%) and severe in 20 (4.5%).

No correlation was found between aetiology of liver diseases, initial maintenance immunosuppression. Conclusion: a suboptimal graft with prolonged cold ischaemic time in recipients with previous need of renal support seems to be associated with absence of rejection. These data are in contrast with previous reports. These factors may be helpful in identifying patients who do not need to be submitted to protocol liver biopsy.

Summary: There was good correlation between the trough levels taken on 2 occasions in the stable paediatric post liver transplant group of patients. The range of C2 peak levels were also similar suggesting good bioavailablity Conclusion: This preliminary study on long term post transplant recipients suggests that a peak C2 level is within the range of 280-460 microgramll. Background Hepatocytes and cholangiocytes release substantial amounts of adenosine triphosphate into bile, where it is rapidly degraded by membrane-bound ecto-ATPase and 5'-nucleotidase. This degradation process leads to the generation of adenosine and inorganic phosphate (I?#. Whereas adenosine is reabsorbed in a sodium-dependent manner back into hepatocytes, little is known about the fate of biliary PI. In rat, biliary PI concentration is 0.01 mM, which is about 100 fold lower than in hepatocytes (1 mM) and 200 fold lower than in plasma (2.3 mM)9 indicating active reabsorption of PI from bile canaliculi andlor from the biliary tree. Aim: The purpose of the present study was to functionally characterize canalicular P, reabsorption in rat liver and to identify the involved P, transport system(s). Methods: P, transport was determined in isolated canalicular liver plasma membrane (cLPM) vesicles using a rapid filtration technique. Identification of putative P, transporters was performed with Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from rat liver total mRNA using sodiumlphosphate cotransporter specific primers for NaPi-IIb (GGGATTGGGAAATTCATCCTI TTCCAACACAAGGTTGGTCA), NaPi-111 subtype PiT-1 (CATCTCGGTGGGATGTGCITGTTGCTCTCTCCTCCTTCA) and NaPi-I11 subtype PiT-2 (GCTCTACCATTGGCTTCTCGlACA-GAGGAAGTGCCTGGAGA)3. On the protein level, phosphate transporter expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis in isolated basolateral (bLPM) and canalicular (cLPM) rat liver plasma membrane vesicles. Specific polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against antigenic peptides from mouse NaPi-IIb and human NaPi-IIIlPiT-2 showing >88% identity with rat homologues. Results: Transport studies in isolated cLPM vesicles demonstrated sodium-dependent P, uptake (NaJut > NaG 3877 pmollmin; K&t > KG 107 pmollmin). Initial Na+-dependent P, uptake was linear for at least 6 sec and exhibited a clear overshoot indicating transient intravesicular concentration of P, (secondary active P, transport). Initial P, uptake rates (4 sec) were saturable with increasing P, concentrations and exhibited an apparent K,,, value of -11 kM.",

In addition, an intravesicular negative membrane potential stimulated sodium-dependent P, transport indicating a Na:P, stoichiometry of > 1. These data are comparable with the transport characteristics of sodiumlphosphate cotransporters NaPi-IIb, NaPi-IIIlPiT-1 and NaPi-IIIlPiT-23. mRNAs of all these three NaPi's were found to be expressed in rat liver by RT-PCR. However, on the protein level only NaPi-IIb was found to be expressed selectively in cLPM, whereas NaPi-IIIlPiT-2 was detected in bLPM. No clearcut localization of NaPi-IIIlPiT-1 protein could be obtained. Conclusions: The canalicular membrane of rat hepatocytes localizes the sodiumlphosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIb, which can reabsorb P, from primary hepatic bile back into hepatocytes. In contrast, NaPi-IIIlPiT-2 was found to be expressed at the basolat-era1 hepatocyte plasma membrane. The results indicate that NaPi-IIb regulates P, concentration in bile and may play an important role in the overall P, homeostasis in rat liver BackgroundlAims. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of transport proteins of the basolateral hepatocyte membrane. Human OATP8 (SLC21A8) is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and is an uptake system for xenobiotics such as digoxin. The OATP8 gene promoter possesses an inverted repeat (IR1) element at nt -82l-70 relative to the transcription start site, that binds and is activated by the farnesoid X receptorlretinoid X receptor (FXRlRXR). Ligands of FXR include bile salts such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), previously shown to activate the OATP8 gene. However, because OATP8 is only a poor bile salt but an efficient xenobiotic transporter, we investigated whether xenobiotics such as rifampicin regulate the OATP8 gene. Rifampicin is a prototypic ligand of the xenobiotic receptor PXR (pregnane X receptor). Methods. Endogenous OATP8 mRNA levels in Caco2 cells were quantified by real-time PCR. An OATP8 gene promoter construct containing nucleotides -120l +38 relative to the transcription start site (Luc-120) was assayed for reporter activity in transiently transfected cells. The FXR binding site in the OATP8 gene (IR1 element) was characterized using the luciferase construct IR1-TK-Luc that contained a thymidine kinase promoter under the control of the IRl element. Results. Endogenous OATP8 mRNA levels in Caco2 cells were induced 7fold by CDCA (100 pmolll). Interestingly, incubation of cells with rifampicin (10 pmolll) resulted in a 4.5fold increase in OATP8 mRNA levels. To study the mechanism of rifampicinmediated induction of OATP8, the promoter sequence was searched for potential PXR binding sites. Because the IR1 element, previously shown to bind the FXRlRXR heterodimer, was the only nuclear receptor binding site found, we hypothesized that the induction by rifampicin could be mediated through the FXR element. We, therefore, studied the effect of CDCA and rifampicin on the IR1 element. In cells cotransfected with the IR1-TK-Luc construct and expression plasmids coding for FXRlRXR, PXRlRXR or CAR (constitutive androstane receptor)lRXR, FXRlRXR induced the IRl element llfold in the presence of CDCA and 2.5fold in the presence of rifampicin, indicating that rifampicin is capable of activating FXR. In contrast, PXRlRXR or CARlRXR did not activate the IR1 element in the presence of CDCA or rifampicin.",

            "text": "To confirm that an OATP8 promoter construct is also activated by rifampicin, Huh7 cells cotransfected with the Luc-120 construct and FXRlRXR expression plasmids were incubated with CDCA or rifampicin. CDCA induced OATP8 promoter activity -Zfold, rifampicin -15fold, confirming that rifampicin transactivates the OATP8 promoter. To investigate whether other xenobiotics also activate the FXR element, Huh7 cells cotransfected with the IR1-TK-Luc construct and FXRlRXR expression plasmids were incubated with rifampicin, rifamycin, RU486, clotrimazol, phenobarbital or PCN. A 1.4fold (rifamycin) to 2.5fold (clotrima-201) induction of the IR1 element was seen in the presence of these xenobiotics. Conclusions. The human OATP8 gene is induced transcriptionally by xenobiotics that represent prototypic ligands of the xenobiotic receptor PXR. However, activation does not occur through PXR but through activation of FXR bound to the IR1 element in the OATP8 gene promoter. The data thus indicate that PXR ligands such as rifampicin and clotrimazol can also activate FXR and thereby induce the FXR-regulated transporter gene OATP8.

Manns et al. have compared PegIFN 0.5 pglkglweek + RBV 800 mglday for 48 weeks to PegIFN 1.5 pglkgl week + RBV 800 mglday: no difference was observed in patients with genotypes 2-3; a higher sustained virological response was observed in patients with genotype 1 with the highest dose of PegIFN. Hadzyannis et al. have shown that treatment duration (24 vs 48 wk) or RBV dose (800 vs 1000-1200 mg) did not modify treatment response in patients with genotypes 2-3. No study has evaluated the efficacy of PegIFN and RBV in patients with severe hepatitis (Metavir fibrosis score = 3 or 4). The aim of our study was to compare two doses of PegIFN (0.75 pglkglweek vs 1.5 pglkglweek) and RBV 800 mglday for 48 weeks in patients with severe hepatitis 210 patients were included. The results of the VHC RNA 24 weeks after the end of the treatment (sustained virological response (SVR)) are available for 165 patients: 82 patients received 0.75 pglkglweek of PegIFN and 83 1.5 pg lkglweek. The patients were comparable for sex ratio (2.18 vs 1.96), body mass index (25.6 vs 25.9), intra-venous drug use (40 vs 39%). Age was higher (52.1 vs 48.3 years) and genotypes 2-3 frequency lower (33 vs 39%) in the low dose PegIFN group. The sustained virological response for the 2 groups are presented in the tables below. Conclusions: 1) A PegIFN dose-effect is clearly shown for patients with genotypes 1-4-5; 2) The SVR is still very low in patients treated with the highest dose of PegIFN and the highest dose of ribavirin (9l31). The design of new protocols are urgently needed in these patients; 3) In patients with genotypes 2-3, the SVR is significantly higher with Peg 1.5 -RBV > 10.6 association (21l 23=91%) than with Peg 0.75 -RBV < 10.6 (8/14=57%).",

Jorge Rakela, Marek Radkowski, Tomasz Laskus, Jeffrey Wilkinson, Debra Adair, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; Marek Nowicki, Andrea Kowacs, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CAMother-child transmission of HCV is relatively common in the setting of HIV-coinfection but the mechanism of infection is unclear. I has been reported that perinatal transmission of HIV involves macrophage-tropic HIV-1 variants and furthermore, HCV RNA has been found in macrophages and lymphocytes from HCVlHIV coinfected patients. The current study was undertaken to determine the role of extrahepatic HCV replication in motherto-infant transmission.PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a perinatal HIV transmission study at the Maternal Child and Adolescent HIV Management and Research Center (MCA LACIUSC, Los Angeles) we assessed mechanisms of HCV transmission among HlV+ women co-infected with HCV. HCV RNA was determined in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 45 co-infected women and 48 of their newborns by RT-PCR. Presence of viral negative strand was determined by strand-specific Tth-based assay. To determine origin of HCV strains, amplified sequences were compared by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP). RESULTS: Among the 45 HIVlHCV co-infected pregnant women 15 (33%) had detectable HCV RNA in PBMCs and 13 (29%) transmitted to their neonates. Seven of 15 PBMC-HCV RNA positive mothers (47%) and 6 out of 30 (20%) PBMC-HCV RNA negative mothers had perinatal HCV transmission (p=.08, Fisher's exact test)",

Sensitivity analyses did not find significant differences according to the cause of disease (viral versus alcoholic versus other) for the FT AUROC.ActiTest was not associated with gradient and had no predictive values for EPP or HEPP in univariate or multivariate regression analysis together with FT. Conclusion: FibroTest, a simple and non-invasive quantitative estimate of liver fibrosis, could help clinicians predict portal hypertension, thereby reducing the indication of endoscopic screening for varices and simplifying medical management. Biopredictive: Investigator Thierry Poynard -Biopredictive: ConsultantlAdvisor; Investigator Vlad Ratziu -No relationships to disclose Dominique Thabut -No relationships to disclose Vincent Thibaut -No relationships to disclose Jean Baptiste Trabut -No relationships to disclose Background: Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB) is more difficult to be controlled and rebleeding is more frequent if these patients are associated with bacterial infection. Unfortunately, liver cirrhotic patients are usually have bacterial infections when upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs. Prophylactic antibiotics use was proven to prevent bacterial infection in these patients.(80% males; 16% chronic viral hepatitis C, 11% hepatitis B, 30% alcoholic liver disease, 43% miscellaneous; mean 53 yrs (se=1.5) Each had an upper endoscopy and blood sample taken for biochemical parameters (FT for fibrosis and Actitest for activity), 57% had bridging fibrosis. PHG was identified in 37% of the cohort of which 89% had mild PHG and 11% had severe PHG. The frequency of mucosal mosaic pattern, red markings, and GAVE was 31%, 15%, and 5%, respectively. PHG was detected more frequently in cirrhotics (48%) compared to non-cirrhotics The ROC curve c-statistic for the final model was 0.72. GAVE features were not associated with gender, recent smoking. or recent alcohol use. CONCLUSION: 37% of CHC patients entering the randomized phase of the HALT-C trial have PHG which was mild in most patients. The significant association of PHG with laboratory markers of liver disease severity, cirrhosis, and esophageal varices suggest that PHG is primarily a manifestation of portal hypertension rather than mucosal injury from topical irritants. CONCLUSIONS: Both MELD and CP may be used to stratify patients with variceal bleeding according to mortality risk. The advantage of stratification of patients with variceal bleeding according to HVPG is yet to be demonstrated. In patients with portal hypertension without variceal bleeding, stratification according to MELD might be preferable, though the small numbers in the higher HVPG, MELD, and CP score groups preclude firm conclusions. *Median survival cannot be calculated since survival exceeded 50% of groupSuwivirl straufled by HVPG, MELD, and CP Score Number of Patients M B d~~~:~ Number of Patients",

Several studies have pointed to the HCV genotype and the baseline level of viremia as the most important predictive factors of responsiveness to IFN therapy. Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) gene family has been implicated in negative feedback regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway including IFN signaling pathway. We have reported that SOCS-1 attenuates IFN-alpha signaling in vitro and that the expression of the SOCS-1 mRNA in the liver of chronic HCV infection patients was significantly higher than that in normal liver. Here, we aimed to clarify the EXPRESSION OF SOCS-1 IN THE LIVER ATTENUATES effect of SOCS-1 in the liver on the IFN-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Methods: We performed prospective cohort study about the expression of SOCS-1 and clinical outcome. Between June 1996 and December 1997, 77 patients with histologicallyproven chronic hepatitis C were registered in Kansai Viral Hepatitis Research Group. They were treated with 10 MIU IFN a-2b",

Multivariate analysis with stepwise logistic regression identified gender (p =0.031), HCV genotype (p<0.0005) and HCV-RNA titer (p<0.0005) as independent factors associated with IFN SVR. The expression of SOCS-1 was also likely to be a predictor of SVR, but it was not statistically significant (p=0.076). In addition, multivariate analysis was performed among host factors including age, gender, degree of fibrosis, baseline ALT level and the expression of SOCS-1. The expression of SOCS-1 was an only significant predictor of IFN SVR (p=0.004). HCV-RNA titer was an only significant predictor of the expression of SOCS-1 in multivariate analysis. (p=O.OlO) Conclusions: In conclusion, these results suggest that the expression of SOCS-1 in the liver attenuates IFNeffect for chronic hepatitis C.

Adrian M Di Bisceglie, Patn'cia Osmack, Joyce Hoffman, Janice Stn'nko, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, St. Louis, M O Background Studies of viral kinetics during treatment of hepatitis Chave been useful in elucidating the mechanisms of action of IFN. Little information is available about viral kinetics with pegylated IFN or the effect of ribavirin on viral kinetics. Aim: To study the effect of ribavirin on viral kinetics and to study the early patterns of response to antiviral therapy of hepatitis C and their correlation with IFN pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD. Patients and methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of pegylated IFN alfa-2a (180 mcglwk) with or without ribavirin (1000-1200 mglday) in IFN ndive patients infected with HCV genotype 1. HCV RNA levels were mea-HCV RNA levels during treatment (day 29, week 12), patients were divided into complete responders (22 log decrease in HCV RNA from baseline), partial responders (>1 log < 2 log decrease from baseline) or null responders (4 log decrease from baseline). In addition, we assessed end of treatment responses (ETR) and sustained virologic responses using conventional criteria. Results: 29 patients were enrolled of whom 28 have completed treatment and follow up. Of these 13 (45%) had a complete response at day 29,16 had a null response and none had a partial response. The mean log decrease in HCV RNA was 1.747 with IFN alone and 1.727 with IFN plus ribavirin. There were no sigdicant differences between day 29 complete and null responders with regard to gender, age, race, body mass index, HCV subtype (la or lb), baseline HCV RNA levels, serum aminotransferase activities and stage of fibrosis on liver biopsy. Complete responders had average decrease in neutrophil count of 62% at day 29 compared to null responders (46%, p=O.O44) while there was no difference in decline in platelet count between groups (33% vs 30%. The proportion of patients achieving a day 29 complete response to IFN alone was no different to those on IFN and ribavirin (62% vs 44%).OAS levels peaked rapidly and reached a plateau by day 3 (increase from 787 at baseline to 2198 pM/hr at day 3). IFN was detectable in serum before treatment in 7 pts. Mean levels increased from 787 to 2198 pglml by day 29. Mean serum IFN levels at day 29 and OAS levels at day 3 were no different between complete and null responders (15,525 vs. 30,768 pglml and 2044 vs. 2323 pMlhr respectively, p=n.s.). Correction of IFN and OAS levels for BMI, BSA and body weight still revealed no differences between the groups. Of the day 29 complete responders, all 13 had an EVR at 12 weeks, 12 went on to have ETR and 9 an SVR while among the null responders 5 had an EVR and 2 a partial response at 12 weeks but only 5 had an ETR and only 1 an SVR.Addition of ribavirin to pegykated IFN did not sigruhcantly affect day 29 IFN levels or day 3 OAS levels. Conclusions: We describe a cohort of patients, null responders, who have little or no decrease in serum HCV RNA during the first 29 days of therapy. Null responders rarely go on to achieve sustained virologic response. Other than decline in neutrophil count, they appear no different from complete responders with regard to demographic and clinical features, measures of liver disease activity, therapy with ribavirin as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, suggesting that IFN resistance in these patients may be virally rather than host-determined.Disclosures: Adrian M Di Bisceglie -Roche: ConsultantlAdvisor; Scientific StudylTrial; Other: This study was supported in part by Roche.

Viral kinetic studies have shown that turnover of hepatocytes infected with HCV G1 is slower than in other genotypes. This implies that more aggressive antiviral treatments are required in patients infected with HCV G1. Extending the treatment duration beyond 48 weeks is one strategy that may improve response rates in these difficult-to-treat patients. Purpose: To compare the efficacy and safety of 48 weeks versus 72 weeks of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) (PEGA-SYSB) in combination with ribavirin (COPEGUSB) in treatmentna'ive patients infected with HCV G1. Methods: Multicenter, national, randomized, open-label parallel group study conducted in accordance with local and international GCP guidelines. Treatment-naYve patients infected with HCV G1, aged 218 years with CHC infection, HCV RNA levels >loo0 copieslml, elevated ALT levels, liver biopsy findings consistent with a diagnosis of CHC, and compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh grade A) were eligible for the study. After screening and signing of informed consent forms, patients were randomized to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) (PEGASYm) 180 pg once weekly plus ribavirin (COPEGUS@) 800 mg/day (400 mg BID) for either 48 weeks or 72 weeks. Patients were followed for an additional 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Virological response was defined as undetectable HCV RNA (<50 IUlmL by COBAS AMPLICORB HCV Test, v2.0, Roche Diagnostics) at the end of follow-up. Results: To date 459 patients have been enrolled in the trial and 305 have completed follow-up. The two treatment groups were comparable with regard to baseline characteristics.

Charles Howell, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; Lennox S Jeffers, Miami VA Medical Center, Miami, FL; William Cassidy, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Baton Rouge, LA; K Rajender Reddy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Susan Sheridan, Irwin Ho, Sarkis Khouri, George Harb, Roche Laboratories, Inc., Nutley, NJ Background:Interferon alpha therapy, alone or in combination with ribavirin (RBV), is less effective for chronic hepatitis C genotype l infections in African Americans (AA) compared with Caucasian Americans (Ca). Racial differences in tolerability and adherence to antiviral therapy have not been studied systematically. Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) when used in combination with ribavirin in non-Hispanic AA HCV genotype 1 patients. Methods: Patients with previously untreated chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 1 and elevated ALT were evaluated. Patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) 180 yg sc once weekly plus RBV 1000 or 1200 mg orally based on body weight (<75 kg or 275 kg) for 48 weeks, with 24 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Efficacy was assessed by sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA (<50 IUlmL) at week 72. Adverse events (AEs) reported by patients and clinical laboratory test results were used to assess tolerability and safety. Results: A total of 106 patients received at least one dose of study medication. Of patients completing treatment, 62 of 78 (80\u00b0/0) were AA and 22 of 28 (79%) were Ca. The SVR rate (26%) was lower among AA patients than among Ca patients (39%). The most frequent AEs reported included headache, fatigue, rigors, insomnia, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, pyrexia, depression, dizziness, irritability, dyspnea and injection site erythema; most reported at a higher frequency by Ca than by AA. Serious AEs occurred in 9% (7 of 78) of AA patients and in 25% (7 of 28) of Ca patients; however, only 3 were considered to be treatment-related by the investigators (thrombocytopenia, upper abdominal pain and possibly hydronephrosis). AA patients had lower baseline absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) (AA 2.9 5 0.15 x 109/L vs. Ca 3.5 i 0.19 x lO9/L). Reductions in ANC by 45% for A A s were observed after one week of therapy, sustained during treatment, and returned to pretreatment levels early in the follow-up period. A gradual 51% decline in ANC occurred by week 6 for the Ca patients. The ANC nadir for AA was 1.6 2 0.09 x 109/L, similar to that for Cas, 1.7 + 0.10 x 109/L. Similar results on treatment and during follow-up were observed for hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet counts. Hb levels decreased to to 4 5 gldL in 4 (5%) AA patients and 2 (7%) Ca patients. Platelet counts <SO x 109lL (not associated with bleeding-related adverse events) were evident in 3 (4%) AA patients and 1 (4%) Ca patient. Dose modifications of peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) (withheld or reduced) occurred among 46% A A s and 29% Cas; the most common indication was neutropenia (37% and 18% among A A s and Cas, respectively). RBV dose modifications occurred for 40% of AAs and 46% of Cas, primarily due to anemia. Few patients withdrew prior to the end of treatment at week 48 for AEs or laboratory abnormalities, 4 of 78 (5%) in the AA group and 4 of 28 (14%) in the Ca group. Discontinuations due to hematologic suppression were as follows: 1 AA patient for neutropenia, 1 AA patient for anemia and 1 Ca patient for thrombocytopenia. One AA patient died as a result of an acute anterior myocardial infarction 180 days after receipt of the last dose of RBV. The death was considered to be unrelated to treatment by the investigator. Large majorities of both groups, 67 (86%) of AA patients and 25 (89%) of the Ca patients demonstrated 80% adherence to the therapeutic regimen, calculated as total cumulative doseltotal original dose prescribed, indicating that compliance was similar between racial groups. Conclusions: Peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) plus RBV demonstrated good safety and tolerability in AA patients in this trial. While dose modifications for neutropenia and anemia were conducted according to protocol, hematologic suppression had minimal affects on overall adherence to therapy. Adverse events were generally mild.Disclosures: William Cassidy -Hoffmann LaRoche: Investigator George Harb -Roche Laboratories, Inc.: Employee Irwin Ho -Roche Laboratories, Inc.: Employee Charles Howell -Hoffmann LaRoche: Investigator Lennox S Jeffers -Hoffmann LaRoche: Investigator; Gilead Meeting ParticipantlLecturer; Intermune: Meeting ParticipantlLecturer; Scandipharm: Meeting ParticipantlLecturer Sarkis Khouri -Roche Laboratories, Inc.: Employee K.

Laurent L Aln'c, Jacques Izopet, Sophie Metivier, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France; Jean Tkaczuck, Bernard Pipy, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France; Jean-Piem Vinel, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, FranceAims : Patients with severe liver disease, genotype 1 infection, high viral load and no response to primary IFNa-ribavirin therapy have poor predictive factors of response to antiviral therapy. The aim of this randomized prospective study was to assess the efficacy and the safety of a triple therapy by IFNa2a-ribavirin-IL-2 in these difficult to treat patients. Method : 20 HCV patients without HIV co-infection who were previously nonviral responders to IFNa (3 millions IU 3 times a week) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg daily) were included. All eligible patients had : genotype 1 infection, high viral load > 200 000 IUI mL (Amplicor Monitor Roche) and Metavir fibrosis score >= 2. Each patient was re-treated IFNa2a-ribavirin combination therapy. Results : On the liver biopsy performed within 12 months before the start of triple therapy, Metavir fibrosis score was 3.3 +I-0.7 and 10 patients had cirrhosis (50%). Baseline viral load was 788 650 IUlmL. In group 1, at the end of treatment (week24), a decrease (p< 0.05) of viral load (298 538 ? 94 406 1UlmL)was observed as compared to baseline values (932 300 2 689 509 IUI mL). No significant differerence was observed in group 2. At the end of tri-therapy, a viral response was observed in 4 of 20 patients (20%) : 2 in each group. A viral relapse occured in all cases within 12 weeks after tri-therapy discontinuation. No serious adverse effect was observed during treatment. Conclusions : In patients with poor predictive factors of response, intensification of antiviral therapy could be associated to a viral response. A careful monitoring of viral load kinetic in group 1 and in group 2 before and under IL-2 therapy will determine the influence of IL-2 on these results. Such triple therapy is well tolerated in out patients. The combination of IL-2 with Peg-IFN ribavirin or during a longer period needs to be tested.Disclosures: Laurent L Alric -No relationships to disclose Jacques lzopet -No relationships to disclose Sophie Metivier -No relationships to disclose Bernard Pipy -No relationships to disclose Jean Tkaczuck -No relationships to disclose Jean-Pierre Vinel -No relationships to disclose INTERIM RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF 1.5pGl KG VS. 3.0 pGlKG PEGYLATED INTERFERON ALFA 2-B PEG-INTRON(R) (PEG) PLUS RIBAVIRIN (RBV) FOR NAIVE CHRONIC HEPATITIS C PATIENTS AND 3.0pG/KG PEG (R) TO PREVIOUS THERAPY.

There was no difference of the drop in hemoglobin level at every 4 weeks during therapy between two groups. The degree of drop in hemoglobin levels at 8 and 26 weeks after initiation of therapy was significantly correlated with the 205n-3 PUFA levels at the corresponding time in control group (r=0.57, P=0.027 at 8 weeks, r=0.73, P=O.Ol at 26 weeks). a-tocophenol concentrations in erythrocyte significantly increased and the levels of plasma TBARS significantly decreased at 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and thereafter as compared to basal ones in patients of vitamin group. Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate that the content of 20511-3 PUFA in erythrocyte membrane sigruficantly decreases during interferon plus ribavirin therapy and this peroxidation is attenuated by vitamin E and vitamin C. However, the administration of only vitamin E and vitamin C seemed to be insufficient for preventing ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia. Supplementation of 205n-3 PUFA may be a promising tool for it.Disclosures: Ren Fenyu -No relationships to disclose Takakazu Furutani -No relationships to disclose Yuh-ichi Hara -No relationships to disclose Keisuke Hino -No relationships to disclose Akira Kitase -No relationships to disclose Ayako Nagai -No relationships to disclose Kiwamu Okita -No relationships to disclose Misako Okita -No relationships to disclose Michiari Okuda -No relationships to disclose Yasuko Ota -No relationships to disclose Takayo Sasagawa -No relationships to disclose Yuhki Yamaguchi -No relationships to disclose 337 MXA GENE EXPRESSION AS A SENSITIVE MARKER FOR IFN BIOACTIVITY AND NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES IN CHRONIC HEPATITIS C VIRUS INFECTION. Carl /oms, Robert Thimme, Hans-Christian Spangenberg, Nadine Kersting, /ens Rasenack, Manfred Weidmann, Hubert E Blum, Otto Huller, Georg Kocks, University of Freibuvg, Freiburg, GemanyIntroduction: MxA is an interferon (1FN)-induced protein with GTPase activity. It shows antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses, including influenza viruses, measles virus, bunyaviruses and hepatitis B virus but not hepatitis C virus. Additionally MxA has been widely used as a specific marker for type I IFN activity in various clinical and paraclinical settings. It is known that administration of IFN in chronic viral hepatitis leads to the development of anti-IFN antibodies in a portion of patients. However, the clinical significance of antibodies against IFN is still controversial. Here we present a sensitive, quantitative and readily applicable method to monitor MxA expression in chronic HCV infection with or without therapy and its possible role to detect clinically relevant anti-IFN antibodies. Methods: A one step Light Cycler RT-PCR to quantify MxA gene expression was established using total RNA isolated from PBMCs. MxA gene expression was normalized to 18SrRNA. Subjects:",

The amount of MxA gene induction during IFN therapy is not helpful to predict the response to antiviral therapy since almost all patients irrespective of therapy outcome show an increase of MxA expression. In contrast, the lack of MxA induction might be helpful predicting therapy failure caused by clinically relevant neutralizing anti-IFN antibodies.

Simon M Rushbrook, Esther Unitt, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK; Shilpa Chokshi, Nikolai Naoumov, University College London, London, UK; Graeme ] M Alexandeu, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK Background The basis of viral persistence in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. Chronic infection is associated with weak Thl responses to viral proteins in contrast to the more vigorous response in those who eliminate HCV or respond to antiviral therapy. We propose that persistent infection is favoured by generation of virus specific CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory lymphocytes (T-regs) that inhibit protective virus specific responses including Thl responses. Methods: Twelve viraemic HCV carriers were studied. Four had recovered from previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 8",

Conclusions: T-regs in chronic HCV infection mask or inhibit virus specific Thl responses, which are revealed readily in vitro by depletion. A similar approach in patients would represent a novel theapeutic approach. The hypothesis that T-regs mediate persistent HCV infection is supported by these data.

Among risk factors, only steatosis was associated with significant increased of serum malondialdehyde (p=0.02) and decreased of serum superoxide dismutase (p=O.O1). Conclusions: In patients with chronic hepatitis C, oxidative stress is a significant feature and is correlated with the severity of fibrosis. Steatosis is the main risk factor of fibrosis associated with oxidative stress suggesting lipid peroxidation pathway for fibrogenesis.Disclosures: Jacqueline Capeau -No relationships to disclose Marc Conti -No relationships to disclose Laetitia Fartoux -No relationships to disclose Guillaume Lefhre -No relationships to disclose Armelle Poujol-Robert -No relationships to disclose Raoul Poupon -No relationships to disclose Lawrence D Serfaty Sr -No relationships to disclose 421 NEGATIVE REGULATION OF INTRACELLULAR HEPATITIS C VIRUS REPLICATION BY INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR-3. Tsuyoshi Yamashiro, Toho Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan; Masayuki Kurosaki, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Naoya Sakamoto, Nobuyuki Enornoto, Nobuhiko Kanazawa, Yoko Tanabe, Shinya Maekawa, Mina Nakagawa, Cheng-Hsin Chen, Mamoru Watanabe, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, JapanBackgrounds Interferon regulatory factors-3 (IRF-3) plays an important role in initiating cellular antiviral responses (Doyle SE, 2002 Immunity). IRF-3 is phosphorylated by virus infection through unknown mechanisms. The phosphorylated IRF-3 induces transcription of type I IFNs and other antiviral genes. In the present study, we have evaluated effects of IRF-3 on intracellular hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by modulation of gene expression of IRF-3 by small interfering RNA, siRNA. Methods An HCV subgenomic replicon, Rep-Feo was constructed which expressed selectable chimeric reporter protein of firefly luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase. Replicon RNA was synthesized in-vitro, and was transfected into the Huh7 cells. After G-418 selection, cells harboring continuous replicon-expression were established (Huh7/Rep-Feo). Four siRNAs were designed to target protein coding frame of IRF-3 mRNA. To confirm the effect of the siRNAs on the gene silencing, Western blotting was performed using anti-IRF3 antibody. To evaluate effect of the siRNAs on transcriptional activity of the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter, the ISRE-luciferase reporter assay was performed. The effects of IRF-3 on the levels of HCV replication were analyzed by transfection of siRNAs into Huh7/Rep-Feo cells and sequential luciferase reporter assays. Results Transfection of the IRF-3-directed siRNAs inhibited expression of IRF-3 protein by dose-dependent manner. The ISRE-luciferase reporter activities in the siRNA-treated cells were significantly decreased to 38 t 2%. There were no effects on expression of ISRE-independent genes by transfection of the siR-NAs. More interestingly, by the knock-down of IRF-3, the HCV replication levels significantly increased up to 203.6211.6%, depending on the expression levels of IRF-3.ConclusionOur results suggest that IRF-3 negatively regulates intracellular HCV replication. Therefore, IRF-3 might be a key molecule to elucidate the host defense mechanisms against HCV infection.indicates pQ).O!i.I R F -l d i d e d si RNA (nM)Cheng-Hsin Chen -No relationships to discloseNobuyuki Enomoto -No relationships to disclose Nobuhiko Kanazawa -No relationships to disclose Masayuki Kurosaki -No relationships to disclose Shinya Maekawa -No relationships to disclose Mina Nakagawa -No relationships to disclose Naoya Sakamoto -No relationships to disclose Yoko Tanabe -No relationships to disclose Mamoru Watanabe -No relationships to disclose Tsuyoshi Yamashiro -No relationships to disclose SLA ANTIBODIES IN DE NOVO AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.

HOW DOES WEIGHT AFFECT POST-OPERATIVE SURVIVAL? Masaru Tsuchiya, Sammy Saab, Douglas G Farmer, Bob Saggi, Sherlin A Gordon, Garrett M Hisatake, John F Lenq Mark R Ghobrial, Hassan Yersis, Ronald W Busuftil, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Lcrs Angeles, CA BackgroundObesity is an increasing problem society. In the transplant setting, obesity is believed to adversely impact on post-surgical outcomes but not necessarily survival. We tested the hypothesis that weight is associated with worse outcomes and survival after liver transplantation. Our aim was to study the impact of both Body Mass Index (BMI) and MELD score on clinical outcome. Patients & Methods: We retrospectively studied 87 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis transplanted between 1994 and 2002. Patients were stratified into two groups based on their pre-transplant BMI: non-obese (<BMI 25 kg/m2) and ovenveightlobesity (>25.1kg/m2). Values were compared using student's T test, Chi-square, and ANOVA. Independent predictors of survival were identified using Cox regression analysis. Result MELD scores, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, INR, and creatinine were significantly higher for the ovenveightlobesity group than the non-obese group (p c0.05). There were no significant difference in intra-operative blood requirement, ICU duration, and total hospital stay (p> 0.05). Dialysis need was greater in the ovenveight/obesity group (p<0.05). Patient survival was worse in the overweightlobesity group at 2 and 5 years (87 vs 64%; 84 vs 61%) (p<0.05). Independent risk factors of mortality included ovenveight/obesity, MELD score, and creatinine. Conclusion: Ovenveightlobesity affects both short and long-term survival after liver transplantation. Patients and their providers should be aware of the impact of obesity on the post-transplant survival. Disclosures: Ronald W Busuttil -No relationships to disclose Backgroun& Liver transplantation(LT) has been universally recognized to improve survival of patients suffering from alcoholic cirrhosis at the Pugh C stage. However, for Pugh B patients no evidence of survival advantage has ever been demonstrated up to now. The aim of the present study was to compare survival in alcoholic l'ugh B cirrhotic patients treated by LT (arm I) versus standard treatments (arm 11).Methods : Between March 1994 and November 2001,120 patients (23% women) with a mean age of 49.9 (21.3) years from 13 centers were randomly assigned to arm I (60 patients) or arm II (60 patients). B and C viral infections, hepatocellular carcinomas or other malignancies as well as contraindications to LT were exclusion criteria. A stratification on investigator center, age, sex and complications of cirrhosis was performed. At inclusion, patients of both arms were quite similar. The reasons for inclusion were refractory ascites (78%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (lo%), recovery from Pugh C stage (22%), recurrent variceal bleeding (16 %) and spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy (7%). For ethical reasons after randomization, if a patient of arm I improved while awaiting LT, or if he developed a contraindication to surgery, he was dropped from the waiting list; conversely, in arm II, if a patient worsened, LT was proposed. In each arm, patients were followed up every 3 months for 5 years, and all patients completed the study. Immunosuppresion was done according to the protocol of each center. Results: At the end point (April first 2003), 41 patients of arm I were transplanted (28 in the first 6 months) as compared with 15 patients of arm II (3 in the first 6 months). 19 patients of arm I were not transplanted due to disease improvement (n = 6), death in waiting list (n = 6) and occurrence of a contraindication to surgery (n=7). The actuarial survival at 2 years was 73% in arm I and 80% in arm II(p=0.21). An unexpected and worrying result was the high prevalence of extrahepatic malignant tumors in transplanted patients (12 out of 56; 21%) as compared with non-transplanted patients (5 out of 64; 8%) (p=0.03). In transplanted patients, malignancies were throat carcinomas (n=3), bronchus carcinomas (n=3), pancreas carcinoma (n=l), lymphoma (n=l), basal-cell carcinomas (n=3) and squamous-cell carcinoma (n=l), whereas in the non-transplanted patients, malignancies were throat carcinoma (n=l), hepatocellular carcinoma (n=l), prostate carcinoma (n=l), breast carcinoma (n=l), colon carcinoma (n=l). The incidence of malignant tumors was higher in transplanted patients than in non transplanted patients (6.99% versus 2.66%; p=0.002).In transplanted patients the risk of tumor was 2.3 times higher than in non-transplanted patients (p=0.004). Malignancies were the causes of death in 6 out of 56 transplanted patients and 2 out of 64 of non-transplanted patients.Conclusion: This first randomized study comparing LT to standard treatment in Pugh B cirrhotic patients did not show better 2-year survival in patients randomized for LT. Moreover, LT was associated with a higher occurrence of extrahepatic malignant tumors.

VS. PRIMARY CALCINEURIN INHIBITORS. Hassan Zaghla, Robert R Selby, Jeffrey A Kahn, Emily Ramicone, John A Donovan, Nicholas Jabbour, Yuri Genyk, Rodrigo Mateo, Singh Gagandeep, Linda S Sher, Linda Chan, Tse-Ling Fong, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Background Sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressive agent that blocks interleukin-2-dependant T cell proliferation. The role of sirolimus in liver transplantation (OLT) is still not well defined.&: To report our experience with sirolimus in OLT recipients who received sirolimus without CNI or in combination with CNI as part of the initial immunosuppressant regimen and to compare the outcomes with patient who received CNI only. Methods: The medical records of 194 adult patients who underwent OLT between May 1996 and September 2002 were reviewed. They were divided into three groups based on their initial iminunosuppressant regimen: Group S A Sirolimus alone-without CNI (n=31), Group SC: Sirolimus combined with CNI (n=58) and Group CNI without Sirolimus (n=105). The following endpoints were assessed graft and patient survival incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR), renal function including the need for dialysis after transplantation, hematological parameters and the frequency of vascular, biliaiy, and wound healing complications Results: One year patient actuarial survival rates were similar; 92.6% Group SA, 98.2% Group SC and 87% Group CNI (p=ns). The incidence of ACR was similar among the three groups; 19% Group SA, 33% Group SC and 26% Group CNI (p=ns). Although baseline mean serum creatinine (Cr) level, was significantly worse in Group SA (Group SA, 2.32 F 1.54 vs. Group SC, 1.52 i 1.26 VS. Group CNI, 1.26 2 0.81 mgldL, p<O.OOOl), mean serum Cr among the three groups at one month post OLT was similar (Group SA, 1.29 -C 0.77 vs. Group SC, 1.02 % 0.55 vs. Group CNI, 1.02 ? 0.51 mgldL, p=ns). More patients in Group SA required dialysis before OLT (Group SA, 26% vs. Group SC, 9% vs. Group CNI, 5% p=0.003), but at one year post-OLT dialysis rate was similar among the groups (6% Group SA vs. 5% Group SC VS. 3% Group CNI, p=ns). Mean hemoglobin values were lower in Group SA (p=0.0075) while white blood cell and platelet counts were similar in the groups. The incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) was similar in the three groups (Group SA, 3.2% vs. Group SC, 1.7% vs. Group CNI, 2.9%). Although biliary leaks occurred at a similar rate (Group SA, 6.4% vs. Group SC, 6.9% vs. Group CNI, 5.7%, p=ns) the frequency of biliary strictures was significantly higher in patients in Group SC (13.9%) vs. Group SA (6.4%) and Group CNI (2.9%)(p=0.028). There was no significant difference in wound healing among the three groups. Conclusions: Sirolimus is an effective primary immunosuppressant for OLT patients. There was no significant renal protective effect with sirolimus over CNI. Sirolimus was not associated with a higher incidence of HAT and delayed wound healing.

Richard B Freeman jr, Abigail Mithoefer, Michael Angelis, Jeffry Cooper, Tufts-New England Medical Center, Boston, MA; Ann Harper, Erick Edwards, United Network for Organ Sharing, Ricizmond, VA;Russell  Wiesner, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN  In February 2002, the MELDlPELD liver allocation system was implemented in the US with a provision giving HCC candidates meeting the Milan HCC stage criteria extra priority to try to improve drop out rates from the waiting list. Centers transplanting these candidates were required to submit explanted liver path reports for review and verification. We analyzed the first year's results for candidates with HCC receiving this increased priority and correlated pathologic findings with listing data. 979 adult patients with HCC were transplanted during the study period representing 23% of the total adult transplants. Of these, 82 % were listed as stage II and 16% met stage I criteria. Only 4.1% of candidates listed at stage IT and 7.0% of stage I candidates were removed due to death or tumor progression within 90 day:; of listing. Pathology reports from explants performed from 2/27/02 to 12/31/02 were available for review. 796 transplants were performed during this time with 666 (84%) reports received. There were 2 cases of chohngiocarcinoma and 11 cases of mixed hepatocholangiocarcinoma. 4391, of cases had some form of pre-operative ablative treatment, and 51% had lesions, that were consistent with the preoperative stage request with 11% of these being benign lesions. Microvascular invasion was seen in 7% of cases, macrovascular in 3%. Only 46% of path reports had HCC lesions meeting the Milan criteria with 10% having no lesion, benign or malignant. Pathologic stage distribution was: stage 0,23%; stage 1,8%; stage 2,37%, stage 3,10%; stage 4a, 8% and stage 4b 12%. We conclude that under the new MELDIPELD system, 90-day waiting list dropout rate for candidates with HCC is exceptionaly low with a large porportion of patients transplanted in 3 months. Explant pathology reports indicate that preoperative listing data sigruficantly down staged this cohort of patients. Post-transplant survival data will be critical to assess the over a l l effect of this policy change.RECIPIENT SELECTION CRITERIA FOR THE IMPLANTATION OF MARGINAL LIVER GRAFTS.

Subramanian B K Mahedevan, lndra D M van Mourik, Patrick 1 McKiernan, Susan V Beath, Deirdre A Kelly, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK Introduction: Traditionally Cyclosporine (Neoral) dose monitoring has been based on trough levels, despite poor correlation with overall drug exposure (AUC). Recent adult studies have suggested that the 2-hour cyclosporine level (C2) is a surrogate for AUC(0-4  hours). Aim: To establish an optimal therapeutic range for C2 levels in stable children post liver transplantation. Methods: 24 (15M:9F) children, median (range) age 124.5 months, and median (range) time post transplant 70 months (34-141) were enrolled. All were stable with normal graft function. Paired sample monthly for CO and C2 measurements in whole blood (Abbott axsym analyzer, FPIA technique) were taken on two occasions. Statistical analysis: minimum, median, maximum and quartile. Results: To date paired samples are available in 14/24. Median (range) initial trough level (n=24) 68.5 microgramlL (25-132) and subsequent visit (n=14) 67 microgramlL.

            "text": "There is growing evidence that patients with chronic hepatitis C are more likely to have significant changes in their physical and mental well being, commonly manifested as fatigue and depression, than patients with liver disease of other etiology. Recently published studies demonstrated also that HCV infection is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was reported to replicate in monocyteslmacrophages and lymphoid cells. We have recently demonstrated that leukocytes carry HCV across the blood-brain barrier and we found HCV RNA in the central nervous system (CNS) in some infected patients (J Virol 2002, 76, 10064-10068; 76, 600-608) . However, biological basis for neurocognitive abnormalities observed in HCV-infected patients remains unclear. AIM: To determine the pattern of gene expression in CNS in HCV-positive patients as compared to HCV-negative controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed samples of brain tissue obtained at autopsy from 3 HCV-positive patients and 3 HCV-negative control patients. All were men of similar age, none was infected with HIV. All 3 HCV+ patients and 2 out of 3 controls had liver cirrhosis. Only 2 deaths (one in each group) were liverrelated. The analysis of gene expression was conducted using three different techniques: differential display (GenHunter Inc), reverse Northern, and microarray analysis (BD Atlas Plastic Miroarray). Reverse Northern analysis was used for confirmation of differential display findings. Analysis of microarray data was done using Atlas Image 2.01 (BD) and Cluster 2.20 and TreeView 1.60 (M.Eisen; UCB). Only those genes that were up or downregulated 1.8 times in reverse Northern and/or microarray analysis were considered differentially expressed. RESULTS: The most striking finding was downregulation of mitochondria] oxidative phosphorylation genes in all HCV-infected patients as compared to controls; impairment of brain oxidative/ energy metabolism has been previously suggested to be the proximate cause of many disorders that impair mentation. Another consistent finding in differential display and microarray analysis was downregulation of multiple ribosomal proteins genes and several genes involved in transcription regulation. These could indicate reduced metabolic activities perhaps secondary to deficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation. We also observed upregulation of several genes involved in immune response. There was upregulation of MHC class I and Class I1 and several lymphokine receptors like interferon (alpha, beta), IL-6, IL-9, IL-17 as well as LFA-1 ligand intracellular adhesion molecule ICAM-2 and CEACAM1. Furthermore, upregulation of CD8O and allograft inflammatory factor-1 gene (AIF-1) suggested the presence of activated microglia cells and/or activated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: We found downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes and upregulation of genes involved in immune response in brains from HCV-positive patients when compared to HCV negative patients. Our findings provide the likely substrate for neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment associated with HCV infection. Medicine, Ehime, Japan; Emmett V Schmidt, Raymond T Chung, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston , M A Background/Aims: We previously reported cell-based HCV replication using a novel binary expression system in which cells were transfected with a T7 polymerase-driven full length HCV cDNA plasmid (pT7-flHCV-Rz) and infected with vaccinia-T7 (PNAS 989847). To circumvent vaccinia-induced cytotoxicity, we sought to determine whether replication-defective adenoviral vectors expressing T7 or cell lines stably transfected with T7 could support HCV replication. Because vaccinia interferes with PKR function, we further sought to define the antiviral activity of interferon-ar (IFN) in these models. Methods: 24 hours after transient transfection of CV-1 and Huh7 cells with pT7-flHCV-Rz, cells were treated with recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vectors expressing T7 polymerase (Ad-T7pol). Medium with or without 1000 IUlml of IFN was changed at day 1 post-infection and every 2 days thereafter. Cells were harvested on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 post-infection. For T7-stably transfected cell lines (Huh-T7), we transiently transfected with pT7-flHCV-Rz, then added IFN to selected cells in analogous manner. HCV positive and negative strand were measured by strand specific real-time RT-PCR. HCV core protein expression was assessed by Western blotting. Results: In the HCV replication system with recombinant adenovirus vectors and with T7 stable cell lines, no cytotoxicity was observed at 9 days. With pT7-flHCV-Rz and Ad-T'lpol, HCV positive and negative strand RNA expression was strongest in the first 3 days post-infection and diminished thereafter, but were expressed throughout the 9 days. In the 2 days after adding IFN, HCV positive strand was significantly decreased (0.48520.213 vs. 0.162+0.017 in CV1, 0.123t0.051 vs. 0.035?0.012 in Huh7, HCV/ GAPDH copy ratio, pC0.05) than the samples without IFN. Sustained expression of HCV RNA and IFN inhibitory effect was also observed in T7-stable Huh-T7 cell lines. PKR expression was strongly induced by IFN, suggesting that PKR is appropriately induced by IFN. Conclusions: We have successfully substituted recombinant adenovirus vectors or T7 stable cell lines in our cell-based binary HCV replication system. In these systems, IFN inhibits HCV replication, and upregulates the PKR pathway. These improved binary systems are a durable and more authentic model for identification of host cellular processes critical to HCV replication.

Patients on the wait list were given adjusted MELD scores equivalent to 3-month mortality rates of 15% and 40% for T1 and T2 lesions, respectively based on theoretical tumor doubling times. Frequently these patients have compensated cirrhosis and hence their intrinsic MELD score is lower, yet they are not candidates for surgical resection secondary to the underlying cirrhosis. To assess whether the additional MELD points for HCC is valid, we sought to examine the impact of the MELD scoring system on a single center's waiting list one year after implementation.Methods: Records of all patients undergoing liver transplantation (OLTx) at UTHSC-San Antonio from Feb 27,2002 through Feb 27,2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Pathology and radiology reports as well as data from UNET were collated for analysis and review. Results Over a 1-year time period following implementation of the MELD system, 126 patients underwent OLTx at our center. Of these 24 were excluded from analysis because of the following reasons: Status 1 (lo), living-related recipient (6), pediatric non-tumor (8). The table below summarizes the pertinent findings. Of the 102 remaining patients, 36 (35%) underwent OLTx with suspected HCC (4 Tl, 32 T2).None of the HCC patients had their MELD score downgraded because of tumor progression (T2-T3). At transplant, 2 patients were found to have extra hepatic disease(one with known HCC and the other unknown) and the cases were aborted. Sensitivity of radiological evaluation for the presence of HCC was 92.5% and specificity 94%. The calculated MELD score at the time of listing for OLTx and at the time of OLTx was significantly lower for those patients thought to have an HCC. Exception points for HCC gave those patients a significantly higher average MELD score at the time of OLTx than patients without HCC. Patients wlo HCC had a Aupper; True MELD of +3.1 at the time of OLTx compared to listing as opposed to HCC patients whose A-upper; True MELD was -0.3. During the study period 34 patients (none with suspected HCC) died on the waiting list or were too sick to transplant while 215 new patients were listed compared to 24 dying the prior year with 163 new registrants (15.8% vs 14.7%). Mean MELD score of those dying during the study period was 22.6 8 (median 22.5) and mean time on the list was 284 421 days (median 99 days). Of those patients dying. 16 had a MELD score of 1 2 4 . Conclusion: MELD has effectively prioritized cadaveric donor livers to the sicker patients. However, patients with HCC are given too much priority as evidenced by all of the wait list deaths occurring in patients without HCC and lack of tumor progression (to T3) sufficient to loose MELD exception points in those with HCC. Likewise, the mean MELD score of those dying was less than that given to patients with T1 lesions(22.6 vs. 24). The recent downward adjustments of MELD exceptions to 20 and 24 for TI and T2 lesions, respectively, are reasonable. Ongoing analysis will be needed to accurately place HCC patients in the current allocation system. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in weight gain between the sexes, those with a BM1>30 pre-transplant and those with a BMI<30 pre-transplant or those on prolonged courses (>3 months) of steroids. Weight gain was significantly greater (p<0.05) in patients aged over 50 compared to those under 50 and those transplanted for chronic liver disease compared with fulminant liver failure. A pre-transplant BMI>30 was a strong indicator that the patient would still have a BMI>30 at 3 years. There was no effect of immunosuppression on weight gain: corticosteroids were discontinued in 59.3% by 3 months and long term use of steroids was not associated with weight gain. Weight gain was similar in those on cyclosporine and on tacrolimus.Conclusions: A BM1>3O is common in the liver transplant population, but seems to unrelated to specific immunosuppression and may be more closely linked to lifestyle. Most weight gain occurs after the first 6 months, and intervention with dietary and lifestyle advice at this point could be implemented to minimise the long-term morbidity and mortality risks associated with obesity. Serum tumor marker estimations are often performed as a part of evaluation for liver transplantation. There is a paucity of information on the effect of ESLD on the levels of these tumor markers making interpretation difficult One tumor marker, CA-125, has been consistently reported to be elevated in patients with ascites from liver disease. Purpose:-To compare the levels of serum CA 19-9, CEA and AFP in patients with ESLD with or without ascites.-To compare the serum CA 19-9 levels in patients with ESLD vs normal controls Methods: All patients referred for liver transplantation between Jan 2000 and Dec 2002 at our center were included in the study. Men with end stage liver disease (ESLD) develop a plethora of debilitating symptoms, including severe muscle wasting, that render many of these patients non-suitable for liver transplantation. ESLD-associated hypogonadism, i.e. testosterone deficiency, may, in part, be responsible for the development and progression of many of these incapacitating symptoms. In general, hypogonadism can be effectively treated with topical testosterone replacement (TTR), which avoids the first pass effect via the hepatic system in contrast to oral anabolic steroids. TTR has been shown to effectively improve muscle mass and overall well being in patients with HIV. However, little is known about the effects of TTR in men with ESLD. The Aim of this study was to determine the potential benefits and safety of TTR in patients with ESLD and muscle wasting. Method:The medical records of liver transplant patients treated for at least 3 months with testosterone gel 1% (5 grams per day) therapy for muscle wasting (MW) from January 2002 to March 2003 were reviewed. Information collected included; demographics, albumin, pre-albumin, transferring, testosterone, estrogen, LH and FSH. Drug safety results were also collected and included, acute cellular rejection, cholestasis, malignancy, and patient or graft loss. Tumor markers for AFP, CA19-9, CEA, PSA, prolactin levels and radiographic imaging was reviewed to rule out and potential malignancy. Patients not treated with testosterone but with a similar clinical setting were compared (Group 2). Results: Thirteen patients were identified with ESLD and MW, group 1 (n=8), group 2 (n=5). Demographics were as follows: (group 1) 6 males, 2 females, and mean age 56 years; (group 2) 4 males, 1 female, mean age 53 years. Disease etiology for group 1: (HCV (n=5), HCV/HIV (n=l), AIH (n=l), Cryptogenic (n=l)) group 2: HCV (n=4), HCVILaennec's (n=l). Most patients in group 1 stated a subjective improvement in muscle strength, and overall wellbeing. In group 1, serum albumin levels increased from day 1, 30, 90 (2.18/2.7875/3.45 g/dL, respectively) while those in group 2 did not (2.30/2.16/2.0 g/dL) (p= 0.0002). Similar results were seen for prealbumin (days 1, 30, 90) group 1 (10/18/22 mgldL) versus group 2 (10/8/6 mg/dL). In group 1, 7/8 patients received a liver transplant, while 1 remains listed for OLT. In contrast, 3/5 patients in group 2 were transplanted while 2/5 died. Two patients in each group were not listed at the time of evaluation due to extreme deconditioning. Of those in group 1, one patient was transplanted and another patient remains listed for OLT with an albumin greater than 3.5 gldL. This patient presently has no radiographical evidence of ascites. The two patients of group 2, who were not listed for LT due to extreme deconditioning, died on day 28 and 35, respectively. There was no rise in the tumor marker elevations in any of the patients. After transplantation, no patients in either group suffered from rejection or graft failure. Ascites accumulation, as assessed by abdominal ultrasound imaging, appeared to be less in patients receiving TTR (group 1) compared to all 3 living patients in group 2, who had persistent ascites. One patient of the treatment group developed marked cholestasis 10 days after starting TTR and received a liver transplant 14 days later. Prior to starting TTR, this patient underwent weekly large volume paracentesis and suffered from marked deconditioning and recurrent bouts of hepatic encephalopathy while maintaining a MELD score of 8-9 points over a 6-month period. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that TTR increases muscle strength (subjective measures), stimulates albumin synthesis and improves the outcome of OLT. Thus, TTR (Testosterone gel 1%) appears to be of great benefit in patients with ESLD and muscle wasting. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of TTR in patients with ESLD. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), radiofrequency tumor ablation (RF), and laser thermal ablation (LTA) are percutaneous techniques used in the treatment of unresectable HCC. Percutaneous seeding of neoplastic cells along the needle track is a rare complication of these tecniques, and it has been recently suggested to consider with caution these techniques as a \"bridge\" treatment in cirrhotic patients with HCC candidates to LT. The aim of this study was to verify whether percutaneous ablation treatments represent a risk factor for HCC recurrence in these patients. During the period 1990 -2002,32 patients (mean age 53 yrs) with HCC complicating liver cirrhosis previously treated with percutaneous ablation treatments underwent LT in 3 Italian Centers. Among the 32 patients, 13 had monofocal HCC, 19 multifocal HCC. In the latter group, 5 had monolobar disease, 14 had bilobar disease. Considering the 13 patients with monofocal HCC, 7 were treated with RF (associated with transarterial chemoembolization [TACE] in one case), 4 with PEI (associated with TACE in one case), 2 with RF and PEI (associated with TACE in one case). Among the 19 patients with multifocal HCC, 9 were treated with RF (associated with TACE in four cases), 9 with PEI (associated with TACE in four cases), 1 with LTA associated with TACE. On the whole, 38 nodules were treated in the 32 patients. Furthermore, 31 additional untreated HCC nodules were found at pathological examination of the explanted liver. Among the 19 RF-treated nodules, 6 showed total necrosis, 12 partial necrosis, 1 absence of necrosis. Among the 15 PEI-treated nodules 4 showed total necrosis, 5 partial necrosis, 6 absence of necrosis. The 2 nodules treated with RF and PEI showed total necrosis in one case and partial necrosis in the other one while the 2 nodules treated with LTA, showed partial necrosis. The mean follow-up period was 35 months (range 3-130 months). Five patients died during the follow up and the actuarial survival rate was 94% at one year, 85% at 3 and 5 years. Three patients (9.4%) had post-transplant recurrence of HCC which was the cause of death in all cases; the diagnosis of tumor recurrence was made at 2 months from LT (peritoneal carcinomatosis), at 8 months from LT (bone), and at 9 months from LT (abdominal liymphnodes and bone), respectively. The 3 patients had all been treated with PEI before LT and no one of them showed recurrence of HCC at the abdominal wall level. According to our results, percutaneous ablation techniques performed before LT do not seem significantly affect both survival and tumor recurrence rate in patients transplanted because of HCC complicating liver cirrhosis. In particular, no cases of recurrence at the abdominal wall level were observed in the overall series and no one case of HCC recurrence was observed in patients treated with RF alone or in combination. Background: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is valuable in the management of portal hypertension (PHTN) in patients awaiting liver transplantation (OLT). Recurrent PHTN after OLT can be refractory to medical management and portosystemic shunting may be considered in rare situations, either as a bridge to retransplantation or as definitive therapy. In this report we review our experience and outcomes with TIPS after OLT. Methods: Records of 309 primary adult OLT recipients, between January 1995 and December 2003, were retrospectively reviewed. Evidence of refratory post-OLT PHTN was noted. Those who required TIPS were the subject of this review. Demoraphics, indications for OLT and TIPS, evidence of allograft dysfunction and outcomes after TIPS were described. Results: During the study period 6 TIPS were placed in 6 patients at a mean of 13.5 months after OLT (range 2-36 months). There were 3 males and 3 females, age 53.0L7.8 years. Hepatitis C was the primary indication for OLT in 5 and primary biliary cirrhosis in 1. Indications for TIPS included refractory ascites (6), variceal bleeding (2) and various degree of associated hepatic vein outflow stenosis (3). Five patients had resolution of PHTN and 1 patient with refractory ascites had severe hepatic vein outflow stenosis and associated hepatitis C in the allograft. Two patients required re-OLT for recurrent hepatitis C. There were 3 deaths: liver failure 1 month after TIPS done in the setting of allograft dysfunction, 3 months after TIPS with subsequent re-OLT and organ failure, and lung cancer 5 months after TIPS. Bridging fibrosis was present in 3 patients, 2 needed re-OLT and 1 died from liver failure while waiting for OLT. Currently, 3 patients are alive without evidence of PHTN 3, 9 and 58 months after TIPS. Conclusions: 1-TIPS effectively and safely controls PHTN after OLT. 2-TIPS in setting of a moderate to severe allograft dysfunction does not abrogate the need for re-OLT and can be associated with a high mortality. 3-Timely re-OLT should be considered in the presence of fibrosis from recurrent HCV and PHTN. 4-TIPS has been successful in the setting of mild-moderate hepatic vein outflow stenosis and PHTN. Introduction: Biliary tract complications after liver transplantation (LT) are reported to occur in 13% to 35% of patients. The frequency of biliary infections is not well documented. Therefore, we prospectivly obtained bile samples during diagnostic and or therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) in all liver transplant patients from 0112001 to 1112002. Methods: In 67 patients (mean age 53.6 years, range 24-73 years) a total of 172 ERCP's were performed (2.57 ERCFlpatient). All patients had a lumen adapted, end-to-end biliary anastomosis. LT was performed between 3.2 months and 2.8 years before the intervention. Cholangitis was defined as the presence of cholestasis with clinical and biochemical signs of infection not explained otherwise. Only in 19 cases of 172 interventions, positive culture results were combined with clinical signs of cholangitis. The follwoing risk factors were identified stenosis of any type, plastic endoprothesis, choledocholithiasis and previous papillotomy. Patients with these risk faktors had significantly higher incidence of positive bile cultures (77.6% vs 40%, p<O,OOl; Chi-square). In addition, they were more often infected with multiresistant bacteria (p<0.05). 49.3% were resistant to gentamycin, 44.0% to ceftriaxone. Vancomycin (1.7% resistance) was the most effective antibiotic. Imipenem (18.2%), ciprofloxacin (27.5%) and amoxicillin (28.8%) had intermediate incidence of resistant bacteria. Conclusion: In patients with biliary tract complications after LT, biliary infection is common. Clinical cholangitis, however, occurs predominantly in those with risk factors. Gram-positive bacteria were more commonly demonstrated than gram-negative. Cocolonisation with Anaerobes andlor Candida can occur. Ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin seem to be appropriate antibiotics for prophylaxis. Selection of an empiric antibiotic therapy for patient after liver transplantation with sings of cholangitis should be directed toward agents with a low incidence of resistance or a combination therapy. Disclosures: Thomas Buratti -No relationships to disclose ADOLESCENT HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION. Shikha S Sundaram, Katie Neighbors, Lisa Amaruso, James Sinacore, Estella M Alonso, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL Background: Adolescence is an important developmental stage, during which children with chronic diseases begin to assume some of the responsibility for their own medical care. Many children who received liver transplants as infants are now reaching adolescence and their unique health perceptions should be considered in providing appropriate healthcare. The aims of this study were to 1) quantify the health related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescent liver transplant recipients and compare this to a published healthy population, 2) compare parental ratings of adolescent HRQOL to adolescent self-reports of HRQOL, and 3) assess adolescent HRQOL and it's relationship to disease specific disability. Methods: A cross sectional mailing survey of liver transplant recipients between ages 11-18 years, surviving transplant by at least 1 year and receiving care at our center was conducted. Primary caregivers of these patients were also recruited. Adolescents completed the Child Health Questionnaire, Child Form 87 (CHQ-CF87) and primary caregivers the Child Health Questionnaire, Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50). Demographic and medical data was collected using an institutional transplant database and standard demographic survey. A disease specific disability score was calculated using the liver transplant disability scale (LTDS). Mean scores for 12 CHQ-CF87 subscales, including general and mental health, physical and social functioning and self-esteem were calculated. These were compared to published normative values from a healthy population and mean CHQ-PF50 subscale scores. Results: Thirty-seven of 53 surveys mailed were received for a response rate of 69.8%. Adolescent respondents had a mean age of 14.122.13 years, were 65% female and 81% Caucasian. Cadaveric donors accounted for 67.6% of transplants and 38% of patients were transplanted for biliary atresia. A majority (86.5%) of respondents had private insurance and 86.5% indicated mothers were their primary caregivers. After transplantation, adolescents had a mean global health score of 59.28518.47 as compared to mean normative score of 66.38214.62, p=0.031. They had higher scores than the normative population for role behavioral, 94.89211.29 vs. 86.542 21.45, p=O.OOl and mental health, 77.53z10.81 vs. 72.65215.95, p=0.021. All other scores were similar between the 2 groups. Significant positive correlations between adolescent and parental scores were observed in relation to physical functioning, (r =0.64, p<0.0005), self-esteem (r = 0.72, p < 0.0005) and mental health (r = 0.59, p<0.0005). The remaining sub-scales lacked statistically significant correlation. An inverse relationship between inpatient hospitalization during the previous 6 months and mean global health score was observed 0 inpatient days had a mean of 76214.77,l-4 inpatient nights had a mean of 65235.5 and greater than 4 inpatient nights 38.3243.1. There were no other significant correlations between subscale scores and LTDS scores. Conclusion: Adolescent liver transplant recipients report their HRQOL as equal or better than the normative population. Parents may be adequate proxies for some, but not all domains of adolescent HRQOL in this population. were quantitated from wild type and fxrnull mice. Results:Transfection of the mOatp4-pGL3 into HepG2 cells led to a 5.5fold ( 2 1.0 ) increase in reporter gene activity over vector controls. Co-transfection with the bile acid receptor FXR and addition of its ligand, chenodeoxyacholic acid (CDCA), resulted in a further 6.25 ( t 0.35 ) -fold increase suggesting FXR-mediated transactivation.FXRlRXR cotransfection and addition of ligands, CDCA and 9-cis retinoic acid decreased transactivation suggesting RXR-mediated antagonism ( JBC, 278: 10028,'03 ). HNF-1 a also transactivated mOatp4 promoter as shown previously. Mutation of IR-1 sequence in mOatp4 promoter abolished FXR-transactivation. EMSA analysis using rat liver nuclear extracts showed specific binding of nuclear proteins to mOatp4 FXRE which was supershifted by FXR and RXR antibodies. mRNA levels for mOatp4 in fxrnull mice were reduced by 48.3 % compared to wild-type mice ( 0.612 in wild-type vs 0.296 infxr-null mice). Conclusion: Based on the above data, we suggest that mOatp4 is regulated by bile acids by binding to FXR via IR-1 in its promoter. , and G1249A encoded for amino acid changes I1173F, A1450T, and V4171, in the third membrane spanning domain, the second nucleotide binding domain, and the second membrane spanning domain, respectively. The full-length coding regions of the reference MRP2 and three mutants sequences were inserted into the baculovirus genome. Sf9 insect cells were infected with the baculovirus stocks, and membranes were isolated from the infected cells expressing MRP2 or the mutants. ATPase activity was measured by determining release of inorganic phosphate by a colorimetric assay. ATP-dependent transport of 3H-E23G (estradiol-P-(3P-D-glucuronide)) or 3H-E217G (estradiol-P-(17P-D-glucuronide)) was determined by uptake into inside out membrane vesicles collected on filters and counted by liquid scintillation. Results: The total expression levels of MRP2 and the three mutants in the infected Sf9 cells were comparable by densitometry of Western blots of three levels of each protein, indicating total expression in Sf9 cells was not influenced by the mutations. MRP2 ATPase activity was significantly stimulated by the uricosuric probenecid lmM, the cholestatic 250pM, and the mild choleretic E23G 1mM. Although the control and stimulated AT-Pase activities of the V417I mutant were not different from MRPZ, the I1173F mutant had significantly less baseline and less stimulated ATPase activities, indicating impaired function. A1450T had less probenecid-stimulated ATPase activity, but activity stimulated by E217G and E23G was not different from MRP2. Ursodiol saturably stimulated ATPase activity of MRPZ by 520% with Km =72138pM. Although the three mutants transported 3H-E23G with affinities not significantly different from MRP2 (Km=122223 pM), the Vmax of I1173F was only 5.1% (15414 pmollmglmin) and the Vmax of V417I was 157% (4701251 pmollmglmin) compared to the Vmax of MRPZ (29912186 pmollmglmin); the Vmax of A1450T was not different (2967287 pmollmglmin). Ursodiol activated transport of 3H-E23G (60nM) with a peak effect of 950% at 100pM; higher ursodiol concentrations (up to 1mM) returned transport to near control values. MRPZ-mediated ATP-dependent transport of 3H-E217G (44nM) in the presence of ursodiol (1OOpM) for the mutants differed from MRP2 (lo%, 67%, and 140% for I1173F, A1450T, and V4171, respectively). Conclusions: Ursodiol markedly activated MRP2 transport of E23G. Although ursodiol has several anticholestatic effects, these data show its direct effect on transport of MRPZ substrates, and may suggest activation of MRP2 as a target in the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The MRP2 mutants showed several important differences in activity, including changes in transport Vmax, and transport in the presence of ursodiol, and activation of ATPase activity by ursodiol, probenecid, and the MRP2 substrates E217G and E23G. Further characterization of these MRP2 mutants and others will lead to a better understanding of MRP2 structure and function and may yield new therapeutic approaches. Also, although E217G is an established MRP2 substrate, these data show that its noncholestatic isomer E23G is also an MRPZ substrate, implicating MRP2 in the disposition of other estrogen metabolites, which can be interconverted to cholestatic compounds like E217G. Argentina; Nicholas F LaRusso, Mayo Medical School, Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, M N Previous work from our laboratory is consistent with an important role for aquaporins (AQPs), a family of water channel proteins, in canalicular bile secretion principally via agonist-induced exocytic insertion of AQPs into the hepatocyte canalicular membrane. To further define the pathways and molecular mechanisms for water movement across hepatocytes, our AIM here was to directly assess osmotic water permeability (Pf) and activation energy (Ea) in basolateral (BLMV) and canalicular membrane (CMV) vesicles using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Scattered light intensity was used to follow changes in vesicle volume in response to gradients induced by sucrose solutions of different osmolarities. RESULTS: The time course of scattered light for BLMV and CMV fit a single-exponential function. In BLMV, Pf was 10824 pm.sec-' (25 OC) with an Ea of 7.7 kcallmol; in CMV, Pf was 8615 pm.sec-' (25 OC) with an Ea of 8.0 kcallmol. The AQP blocker, dimethylsulfoxide, significantly inhibited the Pf of both basolateral (8124 pm.sec-l; -25%) and canalicular (59?4 pmsec-'; -30 %) vesicles consistent with the presence of AQPs in both vesicle populations. Experimental data for CMV from dibutyryl CAMP-treated hepatocytes fit best to a double-exponential curve implying the presence of two functionally distinct CMV populations; one population had Pf and Ea values similar to those of CMV from untreated hepatocytes and the other population had a very high Pf (6552135 pm.sec-l, 25 OC) and very low Ea (2.8 kcallmol). Dimethylsulfoxide completely inhibited the high Pf value in this second vesicle population. In contrast, the Pf of BLMV was unaltered by CAMP treatment of hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with the notion that the canalicular but not the basolateral membrane becomes more permeable to water after a secretory stimulus due to the insertion of AQP molecules. The data suggest a molecular mechanism for the efficient coupling of osmotically active solutes and water transport during canalicular bile formation.
