Unlike his co\u2010author Jacques L\u00e9vy (see also L\u00e9vy & Lussault 2000), Lussault does not publish in English. Rather than waiting for an uncertain translation, grab this short text as soon as possible to get an idea of his approach, and if reading French is not too much of a challenge, go on with his previous academic work L'Homme Spatial for a more elaborate exposition of his geographical theory. This review will discuss primarily the 2009 book but will also introduce the 2007 volume.",

It should not be translated into English as place struggle, how nice it would be to preserve the alliteration with class struggle. Place is not the equivalent of place in the geographical vocabulary (this would be lieu in French), although it certainly is about space and position. It could be a square (as in Place Louis Renault in Rueil\u2010Malmaison), a location (une bonne place au camping, la meilleure place du parking), a position (la premi\u00e8re place du classement), a job (une bonne place chez Renault) or a seat (une bonne place au concert de Renaud). Locational struggles might be a more adequate translation, if we keep in mind it can relate to sites as small as the space needed for a body to stand, as well as larger ones like cities, countries, continents or Earth.",

            "text": "The catchy title of the short essay signposts an historical evolution in societal conflicts from collective struggles (class struggles) to more individual struggles for the best positions, a shift that erodes solidarity within and between social groups and aggravates interpersonal competition. Nevertheless it is a bit misleading as the main ambition of the book is to disclose the main dimensions of the spatial condition of social life, and to show how the management of space is the core politics of human societies. With Hannah Arendt (pp. 27\u221229), Lussault defines the political as the distance and separation between humans. Political struggles are indeed always about spaces, distances, limits, places . . . but space is often taken for granted in political analyses, much to the frustration of many geographers.",

In three chapters, Lussault shows how social organisation can be understood through the spatial question and how the elaboration of an ethics of the lived space can help redefine the political regulation of contemporary societies.",

            "text": "The first chapter deals with the control of space, which is fundamentally relational for Lussault. He underlines that individuals and groups are not only preoccupied with mobility \u2013 that is the overcoming of distance \u2013 but also with the reverse: distantiation or separation, the shaping of distance between them. In Lussault's grammar of the human space, both the social space of each operator and the constructed space of society are the result of a relation between three fields (2009, p. 45): the spatial operators and their operations, the material artifacts and the spatial idealities (or iconographies). These spatial operators can be individual or collective, human, non\u2010human or hybrid (a notion similar to that of actants in the more familiar vocabulary of Bruno Latour's actor network theory). Lussault stresses how each act is a transaction between opportunities and constraints of space. He poses that human operators seek spatial control and that there are five main competencies to do so (2009, pp. 75\u221296): the control of the relevant metrics (the ways to measure distance and proximity and to master mobility, with a main distinction between topographic and topologic metrics), the competence to claim space (to place and to displace), the scalar competence (the ways to comprehend size and articulate spaces at different scales), the competence of delimitation (the ways to divide space in relevant and meaningful entities, like properties and jurisdictions), and the competence of crossing borders, thresholds, and limits.",

These two address the two sides of what Lussault calls the pseudo\u2010liberal regime of the position market that characterises our society. This is not a society where people are born into a position and role they should perform the best they could, as in traditional societies; but a society where all positions can be conquered, although individuals do not have equal opportunities and capabilities in this competition.",

His examples are based on his observations of micro situations, his interpretation of events widely politicised and publicised, and his ongoing research on urban politics. Many vignettes are French (such as the entrance hall mentioned above or the negotiation of the reintroduction of wolves in the Vercors national park), some are American (the Jena Six story from Louisiana), others are global (container scanning), or generic (the airport). With these short sketches, Lussault is able to make the spatial issues at stake highly visible and to convene convincingly the importance of geographical analysis of conflicts and strategies. As such, it provides geographers with materials to do the same.",

            "text": "The epilogue of the book is a plea for the renewal of spatial (urban, regional) public policies on the basis of a better understanding of the spatial dimension of society. Lussault introduces the notion of \u2018geologistics' to study the contingent and singular combination of tensions between the main spatial principles: mobility (the will to move), co\u2010spatiality (the will to connect), locational struggles (the will to control positions/sites/places), separation and limitation (the will to create homogenous and protected enclosure), filtering (the will to control access), and traceability (the will to know what is where and why). For him, spatial relations are more and more instrumental and nowadays we put a lot of energy in the geologistics of our daily life to co\u2010ordinate our increasingly numerous and increasingly diverse spatial operations. Therefore he closes the book with a call for the elaboration of a spatial ethics inspired on Foucault's conception of ethics, to be able to invent the necessary regulation to avoid that the increasingly crude competition in locational struggles eventually destroys the will to live together in society.",

            "text": "Interested readers will find a more elaborate exposition of his geographical theory in the earlier volume L'Homme Spatial : La Construction Sociale de l'Espace Humain published in 2007. Opening with two pregnant vignettes (the 2004 Asian tsunami and Rosa Park's refusal to leave her seat in the bus in Montgomery, Alabama in December 1955, starting a decisive episode of the civil rights movements in the US), the book operates in three steps. In the first part, Lussault presents the axioms of his theory of geographic space, engaging thoroughly with the geographers' space and geography's vocabulary (with notions as place, area [territory], network, or landscapes). In the second part, Lussault deals with spatiality and how human beings live with organised space focusing on the spatial operations of social operators, including non\u2010human actants (with the SARS virus as example). He discusses more extensively than in the 2009 shorter essay, the importance of the language and discourses and the role of spatial entities like cities, countries, emblematic landscapes and other identity spaces, as quasi\u2010personage and thus as spatial operator (or actant). Finally in the third part, Lussault uses the urban question to demonstrate the pertinence of his approach, developing a grammar of urban space underlining differences of urbanity based on density and diversity. He pleads for a new, pragmatic urban planning that would in the first place have to disclose and explain the mechanisms at work in the different urban situations and to make the main characteristics of the spatial organisation that needs to be arranged insightful for a truly public debate.",

            "text": "Indeed Lussault developed his approach with an original analysis of urban politics, taking words seriously and underlining the performative aspects of political discourses. His empirical research engages with the interventions of Jean Royer, a right wing national politician (he was candidate for the presidential election in 1974), who was the Mayor of Tours from 1959 to 1995 and had a great influence on the major redevelopment programme for that agglomeration in a period when French local authorities gained more competencies and powers in that field (see Lussault 1993).",

            "text": "That most of his examples are confined to the urban arena and to micro geographies of place making (the entrance hall of the grand ensembles, the bus in Montgomery, Alabama), can be seen as a weakness of the demonstration. Even if at times he deals with polytopical inhabitants (people having different places of residence at once) (2007, pp. 348\u2212349), and spatiophagy of the jet set (2009, pp. 101\u2212102), and if he sees geography as a science of human habitation that reaches from the smallest to the global scale and the Globe as human habitat, Lussault shows little interest for larger collective actors like national states or economic corporations. Nevertheless his approach to the spatiality of social life and to spatial struggles is inspiring for those of us working on larger territories, national integration, international relations, geopolitics or globalisation. Exploring the geologistics of spatial operators relevant to these issues should be an exciting endeavour for many more geographers in the coming period, hopefully not only in French geography.",
