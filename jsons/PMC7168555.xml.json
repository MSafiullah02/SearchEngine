Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is the causative agent of PED, belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae and is an enveloped single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA virus (Woo et al., 2012). The PEDV genome consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) organized in the order ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S) glycoprotein gene, ORF3 hypothetical protein gene, envelope (E) gene, membrane (M) gene, and nucleocapsid (N) gene (Li et al., 2016). Among the proteins encoded by the ORFs, the S glycoprotein is located on the envelope of the virus in the large surface projections of the virion and plays an important role in the attachment of viral particles to host cell receptors (Lee, Park, Kim, & Lee, 2010). Thus, the S gene is considered important for understanding the genetic relatedness and epidemiological status of PEDV field isolates, as well as for advancing vaccine development (Chen, Liu, Lang, et al., 2013).",

With the emergence of new PEDV strains, however, serious disease epidemics have been observed in China since October 2010 (Sun et al., 2012). Beyond China, the disease has rapidly spread to more than 38 states in the USA following its first outbreak in May 2013, affecting more than 4,000 farms accounting for more than 7 million piglets (Cima, 2014). Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Colombia have also experienced successive outbreaks, with considerable economic losses to the global pig industry (Lara\u2010Romero et al., 2018; Ojkic et al., 2015; Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983; Valko et al., 2017).",

Consistent with our previous research (Wang, Fang, & Xiao, 2016a), the phylogenetic tree indicated that the complete PEDV genomes evolved into two separate genogroups, GI (classical) and GII (variant), as presented in Figure 1a. Furthermore, genogroup GI evolved into two subgroups (GI\u2010a and GI\u2010b) and genogroup GII evolved into three subgroups (GII\u2010a, GII\u2010b, and GII\u2010c). The GI\u2010a subgroup mainly included the earlier PEDV strains found in Europe and Belgium (virulent CV777) as well as some classical strains (LZC and SM98). The GI\u2010b subgroup included most cell culture\u2010adapted vaccine strains (attenuated CV777 and DR13) and other pandemic classical strains (AH\u2010M, SD\u2010M, and SQ2014) from China and South Korea. Since 2010, identification and sequencing analyses have shown that PEDV strain variants are highly prevalent worldwide. These prevalent variants, which have led to huge economic losses (Wang et al., 2016a), were mostly located within the GII genogroup. The GII\u2010a subgroup included strains from the USA as well as from countries that reported US\u2010like PEDVs (e.g., AH2012, HuB1\u20102017, and HuB7\u20102017) (Figure 1a). In contrast, the GII\u2010b subgroup predominantly consisted of strains from China, South Korea, and Thailand (AJ1102 and CH/SD2014) (Supporting information Figure S1a). The phylogenetic tree further indicated a new GII subgroup (GII\u2010c), which consisted of S\u2010INDEL strains from America (e.g., OH851) and Europe (e.g., GER/L00862/2014) with high degrees of sequence similarity to the ZL29 strain from China (this study, Supporting information Figure S1b), suggesting that S\u2010INDEL strains from Europe may have originated from a common ancestor with strain ZL29.",

However, considerable PEDV outbreaks were reported in Asia and the United States after 2010, even for vaccinated piglets (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016).

Moreover, reports of the newly discovered GII\u2010c strains showed a significant increase after 2012 due to further sequencing from Europe. The above results indicate that the epidemic strains from different periods were from the five different subgroups. Based on the geographical distribution of PEDVs (Figure 1c), the GI genogroup (classical and cell culture\u2010adapted vaccine strains) largely originated from the earlier PEDV\u2010threatened areas, such as China, South Korea, and Europe. The different subgroups from the GII genogroup also showed characteristic geographical distribution. While most GII\u2010a subgroup strains were from the Americas, a small number were from China and Japan or from sporadic outbreaks in a few other isolated areas. The GII\u2010b subgroup strains were mostly endemic to Asia, especially China, South Korea, and Japan. The GII\u2010c subgroup strains were primarily from Europe, with some from the USA and China. Our study showed that PEDV strains from different subgroups were prevalent within the same areas, implying that the coincident \u201chot spots\u201d in PEDV\u2010endemic areas (e.g., China and South Korea, Figure 1c) are critical for determining the sources of some PEDV variations. These \u201chot spot\u201d areas have the potential to be important reservoirs for the genetic variation of PEDVs, resulting in recombination between different PEDV subgroups.",

Indeed, parasites have long been regarded as a harmful factor to the pig industry as sources for a variety of infectious agents (Jesudoss Chelladurai et al., 2017). For example, Metastrongylus larvae are considered a reservoir for various porcine viral pathogens, primarily swine fever virus and swine flu virus (Sen, Kelley, Underdahl, & Young, 1961). However, whether Ascaris suum plays a critical role as a PEDV reservoir requires further investigation.",

Here, the aligned complete genomes were all scanned for recombination using seven different algorithms implemented in RDP v.4.95. The RDP4 results were used to determine if the recombination parents of GII\u2010c were from the GI\u2010a or GII\u2010a subgroups. To further characterize recombination events and accurately determine parents, we performed genome\u2010scale similarity comparisons between the GII\u2010c and other subgroups with SimPlot v.3.5.1, as demonstrated in Figure 2a. This analysis confirmed the chimeric nature of the GII\u2010c subgroup. Furthermore, a statistically significant signal for phylogenetic incongruence in the GII\u2010c subgroup defined two recombinant sources of the PEDV genome: that is, (i) positions 1 to 20,551 and 21,551 to the end from the GII\u2010a subgroup, and (ii) positions 20,551 to 21,551 from the GI\u2010a subgroup. Collectively, these phylogenies showed that the GII\u2010c subgroup evolved from a recombination event, with the 5\u2032 part of the S gene acquired from GI\u2010a and the remaining genomic regions acquired from GII\u2010a (Figure 2a). Molecular clock data analysis indicated that the GII\u2010c subgroup S gene likely originated in April 2010 (Figure 2b). As the re\u2010emergence of PEDV in China was reported in October 2010, the recombination event of the ancestral virus strain in the GII\u2010c subgroup appears to have transpired before the PEDV re\u2010emerging outbreaks.",

Strikingly, the phylogeny of the S gene suggested an entirely different evolutionary history for the GII\u2010c subgroup compared to the other subgroups (Figure 3c). All GII\u2010c subgroup strains showed inconsistent topology in the S gene phylogenetic tree, differing from the ORF1ab gene phylogenetic tree.

After multiple sequence alignment of the complete PEDV genome, virulent DR13 showed strong similarity with KUPE21 (95%\u201399% genetic identity to the ORF1ab and ORF3\u2010E\u2010M\u2010N genes). In contrast, the genetic identity between the S gene sequences of these viruses was only 85% and showed strong similarity with virulent CV777 (95% gene identity). In the S gene phylogeny, virulent DR13 did not cluster with KUPE21 but instead with virulent CV777, suggesting that the PEDV S gene was subjected to relatively frequent recombination, even between divergent subgroups (Figure 3c and Supporting information Figure S2a). Moreover, the Italy/7239/2009 PEDV strain (Chen, Liu, Shi, et al., 2013) may have originated from similar recombination events as those between KUPE21 and virulent CV777 (Supporting information Figure S2b).",

Variations in the S protein are important for understanding the genetic relatedness of PEDV field strains (Chang et al., 2002; Lara\u2010Romero et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016b). To determine the significant S protein sequences among the five different PEDV subgroups, meta\u2010CATS analysis was performed for spike protein sequences of all 409 PEDV strains. We identified 257 amino acid positions with significant variation among the isolates from the five subgroups (Supporting information Table S2). As shown in Figure 4, the GII genogroup contained 11 distinct patterns of aa mutations (I116T, I356T, E365Q, T549S, G594S, N724S, A959V, S1044A, G1173D, S1232R, and R1298Q), distinguishing it from isolates in the GI genogroup. Although the GII\u2010c subgroup S genes shared some aa substitutions with the GI\u2010a and GII\u2010a subgroups (two parents of recombination), they also exhibited three unique patterns (L76, A/S92, and H/T113), which clearly distinguished these isolates from those in the other subgroups, suggesting that the GII\u2010c subgroup S gene evolved gradually through antigenic drift.",

To explore whether the GII genogroup acquired substitutions in neutralizing epitopes characteristic of the GI genogroup, we mapped the significantly different positions to the equivalent positions in representative sequences (Figure 4). Results identified seven substitutions in the neutralizing epitopes of the S protein in the GII genogroup (L521H, S523G, V527I, T549S, G594S, A605E, and L612F), which may explain why traditional inactivated vaccines and attenuated vaccines against the GI genogroup cannot effectively protect piglets threatened by a pandemic strain from the GII genogroup.",

Our genetic analyses showed that the PEDV strains could be categorized into two groups, namely, GI (classical) and GII (variant). We also discovered a new subgroup (GII\u2010c) with novel genetic, molecular, and phylogenic characteristics. The GII\u2010c subgroup evolved from a recombination event between the GI\u2010a and GII\u2010a subgroups, and we further found recombination in two relatively early strains: virulent DR13 and Italy/7239/2009. These recombination events occurred prior to the re\u2010emergence of PEDV in 2010. Additionally, to explore the potential link between S protein amino acid sequence variations and recombination, we performed a series of comparative analyses of the PEDV S protein sequences. We found 10 positions that were localized in a well\u2010known neutralizing epitope and revealed several unique amino acids that could easily distinguish the different subgroups. This study provides critical information to help trace the sources of PEDV variants and identify the evolutionary mechanisms involved. Furthermore, this research will hopefully facilitate the development of diagnostic kits, vaccines, and new therapeutic strategies, which are expected to turn the tide in the prevention of pandemic outbreaks of PEDV.",
