            "text": "Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) strains were previously catalogued as seedling-yellows (SY) and non-SY (nSY) types, according to their yellowing and stunting effects on indicator seedlings. Among subisolates of the VT strain, which were selected from chronically infected Alemow plants, there was a correlation between the presence of 2.4-, 2.7-and 4.5-kb D-RNAs, and SY and nSY reactions, respectively. Similarly, plants infected with Mor-T subisolates, which cause SY, contained D-RNAs of 2.6 to 2.8 kb, while nSY subisolates from recovered sour orange tissue contained a major D-RNA of 5.1 kb. Plants harboring the 2.7-kb D-RNA were protected against challenge inoculation with a subisolate harboring the 4.5-kb D-RNA. This study suggests that the nSY reaction results either from the absence of SY gene(s) in the genomes of certain CTV strains or through the suppression of the effects of SY gene(s) by D-RNAs with 5 H parts larger than 4000 nt.",

Citrus trees infected with CTV display two main types of disease: (i) quick decline of sweet oranges (SwO) (Citrus sinensis L.) and of some other species grafted on the sour orange (C. aurantium) rootstock (8) ; and (ii) stem pitting of grapefruit (C. paradisi) and pummelo (C. grandis) (9) . Other manifestations of infection with CTV include the seedling-yellows (SY) reaction (9\u00b112) which is primarily a disease of experimentally inoculated plants but which might also be encountered in the \u00aeeld in top-grafted plants. Seedlings of sour orange, lemon (C. limon) and grapefruit become chlorotic and stunted when inoculated with CTV-SY isolates, but no symptoms are elicited when SwO or mandarin (C. reticulata) is inoculated (1, 13) . The CTV-SY phenomenon is one of the long-standing enigmas in citrus virology. The early studies of McClean & van der Planck (9), Fraser (10) and Wallace (11) all suggested a complex aetiology of the CTV-SY disease. There have been reports of spontaneous recovery from SY infection by sour orange plants which initially showed SY symptoms, and of the elimination of the SY causal agent by the passage of SY-inducing CTV subisolates through SY-sensitive citrus hosts such as grapefruit and sour orange (12) , which has led to the emergence of non-SY (nSY) isolates. These phenomena have given rise to the hypothesis that the CTV-SY reaction is caused by two separate components: the CTV agent, capable of autonomous replication and responsible for the quick decline and the lime reaction; and a second component, responsible for the SY reaction and able to replicate only in plants harboring the CTV component.",

The genomes of these CTV strains showed considerable sequence deviation within the 5 H half, but were found to have similar organization and to encompass 12 ORFs which potentially code for at least 17 protein products. In addition to the large replicative form (RF) RNA molecule, the infected plants contain a nested set of at least nine smaller species of 3 H -co-terminal single-and double-stranded subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). These sgRNAs correspond to the 3 H -terminal ORFs (16, 17) . Cloning of the VT strain of CTV revealed the presence of several defective (D) RNAs of various sizes, composed of the 5 H and 3 H termini of the genomic RNA with extensive internal deletions, along with the full-length virus. The sizes of the termini varied among species, with minimal lengths of 442 nt and 858 nt from the 3 H and the 5 H termini, respectively, resulting in different sizes of D-RNAs with different junction sites (18, 19) .",

Inoculation of sour orange plants with the VT inoculum maintained in sour lime caused typical SY symptoms (20) . Later passages of the VT strain from sour lime and Alemow plants to sour orange often resulted in inconsistent SY reactions: not all sour orange seedlings showed the SY symptoms, even when inoculum from a single Alemow plant was used to infect groups of plants from a single seed source (Bar-Joseph, unpublished). Subisolates of CTV-VT (Table 2) were randomly selected in 1994 from chronically infected Alemow plants which had been graft inoculated several years earlier (1988 to 1994) with different passages of this strain. The VT subisolates were maintained in a propagation glasshouse with temperatures ranging between 15 and 35 C. The SY reaction was assayed by grafting chip buds from infected Alemow stems onto sour orange seedlings grown in a temperature-controlled glasshouse facility with incandescent illumination to complete 20 h of light, and two temperature regimes (TR) of 26/18 C or 29/21 C for the normal and the semi-warm TR, respectively. In both TRs the high and low temperatures were maintained for 8 and 12 h, respectively, and the adjustment from the high daytime to the low night time level and vice versa took 2 h. The SY reactions were recorded 8 and 16 weeks after inoculation, for the normal and semiwarm TR, respectively. The Mor-T isolate originated from a declining Minneola tangelo tree (21) . The virus was propagated in Alemow and was used to inoculate a group of sour orange seedlings, some of which were inarched with the CTV-tolerant rootstock Go-Tou. Sour orange twigs and leaves showing SY and SY recovery, respectively, were used to infect sour orange and Alemow seedlings.",

The virus titers were considerably higher in sour orange plants infected with nSY than in those infected with SY subisolates. These differences were consistent among plants which were maintained under different TRs (Table 2 ). Low virus titers or the absence of virus (indicated by negative reactions on indicator plants) in sour orange leaves and roots showing severe SY symptoms, suggest the possibility that the SY isolates emit a long-distance signal for a hypersensitive reaction.

The \u00aending that both the CTV and the CTV-SY diseases could be transferred by mechanical inoculation of preparations of CTV particles (26,27) raised the question (28) of the dual-component theory of the causal agent of the CTV-SY disease (12) . Dodds et al. (29) noted an association between two dsRNAs of about 0.8 and 2.7 kb and SwO trees infected with SY subisolates. Molecular characterization associated the 0.8-kbp dsRNA with the replicative subgenomic RNA coding for ORF11 (940 nt) (16, 17, 30, 31) and hybridization with a 3 H -speci\u00aec probe did not reveal quantitative differences in the amounts of the 0.8kbp dsRNAs from SY and nSY plants (not shown). Moreover, low-molecular-weight D-RNAs of 2.4 kb were located in Alemow infected with nSY isolates Mik-T and Ach-T (32) (not shown).",

The variability among subisolates was considered as an indication of the high frequency of mixed CTV infections. D-RNAs were previously implicated in the variability between the dsRNA patterns of parental isolates and their subisolates (5, 35) and the present \u00aendings indicate a correlation between certain D-RNAs and host reactions, and support a working hypothesis that the nSY reaction results either from the absence of SY gene(s) or through the suppression of their effects by D-RNAs with 5 H parts larger than 4000 nt.",

Nevertheless, the possibility that a minimal sequence deviation between other parts of their genomes is involved in these biological differences cannot at the present be completely ruled out. Moreover, the question of the mechanism that causes SY symptoms in sour orange tissues, which contain only low concentrations of viruses or D-RNA remains to be answered. D-RNAs have been isolated from a broad spectrum of animal viruses and, more recently, also from a large number of plant viruses (for recent reviews, see (38) ). Different D-RNAs have previously been reported to have different effects on disease expression: while D-RNAs of tombusviruses had attenuating effects on infection (39, 40) , the D-RNAs associated with the turnip crinkle virus tended to increase the severity of symptoms (41) and the D-RNAs associated with broad bean mottle virus had no effect on some host plants but intensi\u00aeed the severity of symptoms in others (42) . The correlation between the SY reactions of sour orange seedlings and the genomic composition of the D-RNAs in the Alemow inoculum, support the notion that the host type is a major determinant of the biological effects of D-RNAs (43) .",

Later tests conducted at 41 wpci showed continued protection, with the 2.7-kb D-RNA, and mixed populations of the 2.7-and the 4.5-kb D-RNAs in the basal parts of plants protected with the 2.7-and 4.5-kb D-RNA, respectively(Fig. 3). These results are probably indicative of a competitive situation whereas the smaller D-RNA were more effectively transcribed than the larger one. It has been generally thought that smaller D-RNAs can replicate more ef\u00aeciently than larger D-RNAs(24)and co-transfection experiments with different sizes of D-RNAs have demonstrated that the replication of the larger D-RNA was strongly inhibited by replication of the smaller genomic coronavirus D-RNA (25). D-RNAs and the Enigma of CTV-SY D-RNAs of 4.5 and 5.1 kb, which share at least 4043 nt of the 5 H end of the CTV genome were correlated with the amelioration of the SY symptoms by certain VT and Mor-T subisolates. The SY reaction was observed with a Mor-T subisolate which contained low concentrations of D-RNAs (Fig. 1D, lane 2) and with several VT and Mor-T subisolates which harbored D-RNAs of 2.4 and 2.8 kb. Sequence analyses of VT-associated D-RNAs showed considerable differences among their genomic compositions. The 2.4-to 2.8-kb D-RNAs showed 5 H genomic termini of up to 1926 nt and not less than 940 nt for the 3 H part (for details see Fig. 2 in (5)) while the 4.5-kb D-RNA showed a short 3 H end of 440 nt and a long (4043 nt) 5 H end. Similarly, the two D-RNAs, from the Mor-T-SY subisolate had 5 H end which extended to 1772 nt and a 3 H end of at least 862 nt, whereas the D-RNA of the nSY subisolate was composed of a large 5 H part of 4376 nt and a 3 H end of 736 nt",

Plants infected with VT subisolates 1, 5\u00b110 and 13 showed typical SY symptoms, including short internodes and thorns and small leaves (not shown). Plants infected with VT subisolates 3, 4 and 12 developed similarly to non-infected plants or, occasionally, showed a few smaller leaves and were de\u00aened as nSY. The root systems of the SY-reacting sour orange plants were especially damaged and reduced in weight, compared with the control noninfected or the nSY plants (not shown). Among the plants with SY symptoms which were maintained under the high TRs, a previously unrecorded symptom, midday wilting, was noticed 5\u00b16 weeks after infection (not shown).The virus titers estimated by ELISA, of sour orange plants maintained under two TRs after infection with various VT subisolates are presented inTable 2. The virus titers under both TRs were signi\u00aecantly higher for the nSY than for the SY subisolates (Table 2). The virus titers of the apical parts(Table 2) and of the root and rootlets (not shown) of plants infected with VT subisolates 1, 7, 8 and 10, which showed wilting and SY reactions under the higher TR, were either similar to or only slightly above those of the healthy controls. Moreover, grafting of apical sour orange leaves with severe SY symptoms on Alemow plants resultedin  4/18 of virusfree plants. Contrary to these profound differences among the sour orange plants, the ELISA titers of Alemow plants infected with VT5 or VT12 were similar (not shown). Infection of the Mor-T#o isolate on sour orange plants caused a severe SY reaction in all (n 6) infected plants. These symptoms persisted for at least 18 mo, except for the plants which were inarched with the Go Tou rootstock. In the inarched plants, apparently recovered twigs with larger leaves were observed after 1\u00b12 years. ELISA assays showed higher titers for the SY-recovered (SYr) parts compared with the SY leaves (not shown). The sour orange plants n 4 infected with stem pieces from the SY part showed typical SY symptoms. The sour orange plants infected with SYr leaves showed different symptoms, with 2, 2 and 1 plants showing nSY, SY and intermediate reactions respectively.
