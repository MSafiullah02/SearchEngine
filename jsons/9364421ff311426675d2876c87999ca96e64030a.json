Wheat, rice and other grain cargoes can likewise become dangerous through high moisture content. 4 It may seem that the common usage of \"dangerous\" to describe such goods does not mean that the risks presented by them need be extreme or that there is one single category of dangerous goods attracting a uniform applicable set of consequences. 5 However, to allocate liability, determining the meaning of \"dangerous\", or at least of what is not \"dangerous\", is of paramount importance, because different standards of liability are applied. This chapter tries to find out what dangerous cargo means.",

            "text": "In many respects, voyage and time charterparties are quite different, and one of the differences between voyage and time charter is that in voyage charters, the cargo is stipulated whereas in time charters it is more common to include details of cargoes which cannot be carried. 6 If the charterparty provides for a specific type of cargo, the obligation of the charterers is to tender for loading goods of such a type and in such a condition as would be considered reasonable in the light of the provisions of the contract and the practice at the loading port. 7 If the charterers have an option as to the cargoes to be shipped, the cargo offered must be a reasonable cargo of the description specified. It must be such a cargo as is reasonable to ask the master to load and carry and in such a state as is reasonably within the contract. But charterers are under no obligation to select a cargo or combination of cargoes suitable for the ship. 8 The state of the particular cargo is of paramount importance as regards the question of whether it is reasonable or not. The question in the light of the terms of the contract is whether owners who have expressly agreed to carry cargo of that description may reasonably be said to have agreed to carry particular cargo tendered to them. 9 If the cargo is described not specifically but entirely in general terms, the same basic approach still holds good. The charterer must tender a cargo of kind and in a condition which is reasonable in all circumstances. The relevant circumstances would include any terms of the charter describing the ship, any characteristics of the ship known to the charterer before the fixture was concluded and the kinds of cargoes customarily shipped at the agreed loading port. 10 German law also lies down that if the goods are described in the contract not only by type but also by specific description, the shipper must load this specific type of cargo. 11 If the goods are not described specifically in the contract, the carrier is obliged to accept other goods proposed by the shipper for the same destination if loading of other goods neither aggravates his situation nor endangers the ship and the rest of the cargo. 12",

In the absence of circumstances which point to a different conclusion, the charterer cannot expect the ship to have any special characteristics or equipment required for a particular type of cargo. 11 HGB \u00a7 562 (2) . 12 HGB \u00a7 562(1). 13 Art.

The exclusion is justified by the peculiar risk attached to the carriage of both categories of cargo, arising in the first cases from the nature and inherent properties of the animals and in the second from the exposed position in which the cargo is stowed. 15 Art. VI. Such goods are envisaged as \"one-off\" cargoes not in the usual course of trade, where either the particular character or condition of the goods or the circumstances in which they are to be carried justifies special contract.

In the absence of a legally cognizable excuse that for practical purposes renders a statutory or regulatory standard inapplicable, reasonable prudence requires compliance with these standards. As the classic case on the issue puts it unexcused violation \"is negligence\" itself. This is the rule that pertains in the ordinary case, constituting the vast majority of civil actions in which a regulatory violation plays a part. 30 Accordingly a shipper who is in breach of statutory provision in relation to the shipment of dangerous goods may at the same time be civilly liable for breach of this statutory duty. Dangerous goods regulations are specific and detailed so as to raise a prima facie case for civil liability. 31 ",

Parties to a carriage contract may incorporate convention provisions or codes into the contract, even if the purpose of listing of the substances does not relate directly to the distribution of risk between the parties. By incorporating the regulations into the contracts, the parties undertake to comply with certain requirements as to the shipment and handling of the goods. 39 In such a case, failure to comply with the IMDG Code and other codes will also be a breach of contract. Although it is often argued that the purpose of the IMDG Code is the safety of the ship and crew only, the current edition of the IMDG Code expressly states in its preamble that: Transport of dangerous goods by sea is regulated in order to reasonably prevent injury to persons or damage to ships or their cargoes. 37 Lloyd's Rep. 1, a cargo of bagged fishmeal became hot and caused damage to cargo and delay in discharge. Cl. 27 of the charterparty provided that \"\u2026 Fishmeal must be shipped under deck and be loaded/stowed/discharged according to IMO and local regulations\". It was argued that transport by sea of dangerous cargo is regulated in order reasonably to prevent injury to persons or damage to the ship and there is no reference to the risks of damage to other goods or to the goods themselves. At the time of the proceedings of the case, the 1992 Edition of the IMDG Code's general introduction stated that transport by sea of dangerous goods is regulated \"in order reasonably to prevent injury to persons or damage to the ship.\" Therefore, it was contended that there was no reference here to the risks of damage to other goods or to the goods themselves. The Court held that the effect of cl. 27 is to make compliance with the regulations a contractual undertaking, not necessarily limited to the reasons why the regulations were adopted by the IMO.",

Despite its general use and long lists included in the codes, the term \"dangerous goods\" is imprecise and misleading in practice. The fact that any cargo may cause damage makes the meaning of dangerous complicated. What is meant by dangerous? An Argentine court once held a cargo of fresh fruit to be dangerous within the meaning of the Hague Rules, a decision which stresses that it is as much the nature of a situation as the nature of a substance which creates \"danger\". 44 [1979] ULR 202. may be argued that the \"situation\" is the focal point and that it is a mistake to start with the nature of a substance. 45 But the label \"dangerous\" implies perhaps the idea that the substance itself has an inherent dangerous characteristic. 46 Although the label \"dangerous\" implies that the substance has to be intrinsically dangerous, the substance of the hazard may simply be the likelihood of economic loss through delay or property loss through damage to the ship or other goods. The idea of \"dangerous\" may impart the idea of personal injury or, at the most, serious damage to property, but in English law the category has been extended to include \"unlawful merchandise\", the only defect in which was the lack of a licence to land. 47 However, concern at \"dangerous goods\" persists, first because of the potential scale of damage which may be caused by them and secondly, precisely because of the \"danger' factor -which of itself means that the responsibility on those creating and continuing it must be assessed with that in mind.",

This means that many of the major bulk solids are excluded, since they either do not posses chemical hazards 56 or they are classified as materials hazardous only in bulk (MHB). 57 Bulk solids that are covered include some fertilizers, sodium and potassium nitrates, sulphur and some types of fishmeal.

This wording presents the classic issue of whether the general catch-all phrase is ultimately governed by the goods specifically listed. If those can be said to form a group of common definition, it may be argued that the generality might be limited by the common denomination. Is that the case with the IMDG Code listing the goods which are dangerous within the Code? Even assuming that this was so with the IMDG Code, it does not solve the problem, because the IMDG Code regulates only the shipment of packaged dangerous goods. However, in practice not only packaged but also bulk cargoes cause damage.",

A court analyses the legal situation and concludes that the owner of the cargo, or of the carrying vessel, is or is not liable to the injured party.

Safe carriage of many types of cargo depends on the knowledge on the part of the carrier in relation to the character of the goods and the necessary precautions to be taken. Absence of knowledge, therefore, may transform the cargo from one which is innocuous but potentially dangerous into one which is actually dangerous. Such an approach appreciates the multi-dimensional nature of the problem but covers all type of goods, whatever hazards they may create, and treats the category of \"dangerous cargo\" as at most non-existent and at least immaterial. 100 The knowledge of the carrier is of fundamental importance. However, it is relevant to the question of the determination of liability for loss or damage arising from the cargo rather than to the determination of the type of the cargo, e.g. 95 \"The normal meaning of the word 'dangerous' in relation to goods does seem to \u2026 imply that the goods are such as to be liable to cause physical damage to some other object other than themselves\". whether the cargo is dangerous or not.

Cases dealing with defective packing often involve dangerous or hazardous cargo that leaks from a defective container, drum or otherwise, but there are also cases involving a situation where an innocuous cargo causes damage. In common law, a cargo may be dangerous if it is dangerously packed 107 or necessitates cleaning of the ship. For instance, in Ministry of Food v. Lamport & Holt Line, 108 where cargo of tallow contaminated another cargo of maize, the owner argued that it was a startling proposition that anything so placed and innocuous as tallow should be dangerous. It seemed that goods are dangerous in the sense that they can do damage to other goods. Therefore, it was said that there is not much difference between the dam-age done, for instance, by corrosives or by a commodity which leaks something less dangerous. . 109 Moreover, in the SIG Bergesen DY and Co. v. Mobil Shipping (The Berge Sund), 110 the owners argued that a cargo is dangerous if it or its residue contaminates another cargo on the next voyage. That would mean any cargo would be dangerous if it contaminated in the absence of effective cleaning. The court accepted in principle that the shipment of a cargo which, unknown to the carrier, would necessitate extensive decontamination of the ship before she was fit to load her next cargo might amount to the shipment of dangerous cargo. However, this proposition was deemed to be too wide, since it would mean that any cargo would be dangerous if it contaminated in the absence of effective cleaning. 111 It is said that this is a matter of degree and the mere necessity to clean after the voyage cannot render the cargo dangerous. 112",

The charterers, but not the owner, were aware that rice could not be discharged at Piraeus without the permission of the British Government. The ship was detained at Piraeus for 22 days while attempts were made to obtain permission, which was eventually refused. The shipowners claimed damages for detention. The claim succeeded and it was held that the shipper undertakes that he will not ship goods likely to involve unusual danger or delay to the ship without communicating to the owner facts which are within his knowledge indicating that there is such risk, if the owner does not and could not reasonably know those facts. 116 However, this principle extends the duty of the shipper and goes one step further beyond the dangerous goods principle. 117 As the word \"dangerous\" connotes physical damage, it becomes manifestly inappropriate to apply it to cases where the loss to the carrier takes the form of delay or detention. But the common law undertaking is to be understood as a general approach to liability which should include both physical loss and economic loss arising from delay or detention of the ship. 118 It is said that the basis of this general principle has been traced to a passage in Abbott's treatise, where the author states that \"The merchant must lade no prohibited or uncustomed goods, by which the ship may be subjected to detention or forfeiture\". 119 It should be noted, however, that there the author was discussing the situation where a shipment caused detention or forfeiture of the vessel, and not 116 By contrast in Owners of Spanish S.S. Sebastian v. De Vizcaya [1920] 1 K.B. 332, a cargo of coal was contracted to be loaded and delivered to a port in Spain. Subsequently, a proclamation prohibited the export of coal to Spain except with a licence. At the loading port the vessel was detained while waiting for the licence, which, without default on the part of the charterers, was not obtained until 2 weeks later. The shipowners relied on the implied common law obligation as propounded in the Mitchell Cotts case. It was, however, held that as the owners had knowledge at the time the cargo was loaded that it was necessary to obtain an export licence, which might involve delay, the charter was not liable for the detention. See also Chandris v. physical damage to the ship or its cargo. Therefore, it can be contended that the application of the common law undertaking to loss in the form of delay or detention does not involve a purported extension of the dangerous goods principle. 120 If there were any extension, it might be the opposite.",

The provision in the second paragraph indicates merely that a \"danger to the ship or cargo\" is contemplated and that is the governing criterion. However, the word \"dangerous\" is given a broad meaning, not limited to the inherent properties of the goods themselves nor the sort of danger posed. It is contended that the danger may not simply be to the vessel but may extend to other goods on the vessel and it may be affected by the laws at the ports of call or discharge. 124 In The Giannis NK, 125 a cargo of groundnut and a cargo of wheat pellets were loaded in the Caribbean, where there were strict quarantine and phytosanitary regulations. At the second port of discharge, the groundnut pellets were found to be infested with live khapra beetles. This infestation was inherent in the cargo upon shipment despite fumigation and without the knowledge of the shipowners, the charterers or the shippers. Because the Khapra beetle was a voracious consumer of foodstuffs and thus undesirable, the vessel was ordered by the local agricultural authorities to dump the entire remaining cargo at sea or to return it to the country of loading. The remaining wheat pellet cargo was not itself threatened by the infestation spreading to it, but it was likely that the consequence of the infestation of the groundnut cargo was that it would have to be destroyed too, as indeed happened when both cargoes were dumped at sea. The vessel was then extensively fumigated so that she was fit for further trading.",

IV.6 of the Hague-Visby Rules, was that the groundnut pellets cargo was dangerous cargo, presenting a physical danger to the vessel, which required fumigation, and to the other wheat pellet cargo, which also had to be dumped at sea. The House of Lords held that the cargo was dangerous within the meaning of Article IV Rule 6. It was of a \"dangerous\" nature on shipment because it was liable to give rise to the loss of other cargo by dumping at sea and, presumably, to the quarantining of the vessel until after she had been fumigated. What made the cargo dangerous was the fact that the shipment and the voyage were to countries where the imposition of quarantine and an order for the destruction of the entire cargo was to be expected or at least a natural and not-unlikely consequence of the presence of the infested goods. Accordingly, the word \"dangerous\" was given a broad meaning, not confined to goods of inflammable or explosive nature or their like. 126 It was said that it would be wrong to apply the euisdem generis rule to the words \"goods of inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature\" as these are disparate categories of goods. 127 The idea that \"dangerous cargoes\" cover those whose danger is that of quarantine blight in a world where dangerous cargoes are categorized in the IMDG Code and other codes is surprising. The words \"inflammable\" and \"explosive\" do not suggest this, and it is not entirely satisfactory to extend the meaning of the word \"dangerous\" in this way. 128 Art. IV.6 aims at regulating extraordinarily dangerous things such as chemicals and chemical effects that may pose unreasonable dangers to ship or cargo; therefore, infestation should not fall under Art. IV.6. 129",

Generally, the risk in the carriage of turpentine was inflammability rather than explosion, but in a confined place, if the temperature was sufficiently high, an explosion involving considerable concussion might result. It is in Class 3 of the IMDG Code. The chief danger in the carriage of acids was corrosion, though tainting of certain types of other cargo might also result.

            "text": "With regard to cargo damage, cargo which is delayed although not physically damaged may suffer loss in value because of a fall in the market price. Histori-cally neither maritime law nor marine insurance recognizes claims for delay because of the inherently dangerous unpredictable nature of maritime commerce. 154 Likewise, neither the Hague nor the Hague-Visby Rules refer specifically to delay. The question was left to national laws. 155 The word \"damage\" appears in different articles: damage Art. 3 (6); Art. 4 (1), (2),(3),(4), damage in connection with goods (Art. 3(8)), damage or in connection with goods (Art. 4(5) and (6)). In common law, \"damage or in connection with goods\" was interpreted as covering not only cases of physical damage but also delay, 156 whereas in Continental law, contracting states incorporated the expression \"loss or damage\" in Art. 4 (1), (2) , and (4) into their domestic legislation as \"loss of or damage to goods\" and interpreted it as \"physical damage.\" 157 Today the oceans of the world are not considered as dangerous and damages for delay in delivery are awarded on occasion. In English law, in general, even when there is no physical damage or deterioration, damages for loss of market caused by delay in the delivery of the cargo would be recoverable if the carrier knew or could be expected to have known the peculiarities of the cargo at the time of contracting or if special circumstances were communicated to the carrier. 158 Under the Hamburg Rules Art. 5.1, the carrier can be liable for delay in delivery. Delay in delivery is defined in Art. 5.2 as occurring when the goods have not been delivered at the port of discharge within the time agreed in the contract of carriage. Art. 5.2 continues by reference to the time which it would be reasonable to require of a diligent carrier, having regard to the circumstances of the case. The provisions on delay were rather controversial and carriers feared open-ended liability. Furthermore, Art. 6.1 (b) provides a special limit of liability that is not more than two and half times the freight payable on the delayed cargo.",

The vessel developed a severe list and the master intentionally went aground in order to save the vessel and her cargo. The casualty was the first instance in which the maritime or scientific community learned of the thixotropic properties of raw sugar. 169 Similarly, in P. Brown Jun. & Co. v. Minas de Matahambre (The Nord Amerika), 170 the cargo of copper concentrate became colloidal when an excess amount of moisture and oil separated. The cargo, therefore, shifted and caused the vessel to list, forcing it to seek refuge. Arbitrators concluded that \"although copper concentrate per se is not dangerous cargo, such colloidal state is both dangerous and injurious within the terms of the NYPE Time Charterparty.\" 171 By contrast, in Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Buffalo Housewrecking & Salvage Co., 172 a barge was destroyed by fire when its cargo of turnings and borings overheated. The bill of lading contained the provision that the shipper should be liable in the event that the cargo was dangerous, unless full written disclosure of its character was made to the barge owner. In dealing with the threshold issue of whether the cargo was dangerous, the court stated that, although listed in Class 4 of the IMDG Code, turnings are not considered to be explosives or dangerous, but are well-known articles of commerce. The findings of the Bureau of Explosives read that \"iron turnings, borings, filings, when in large bulk, have a fire hazard as they oxidize spontaneously if wet and the oxidation may produce enough heat for ignition. This risk is not sufficient to cause material to be classed as inflammable by ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission) Regulations and material is accepted by steamship companies.\" The court noted that turnings may become dangerous if they contain an excessive amount of moisture or waste material. As the turnings were dry and free of waste materials when loaded, they were not dangerous. 173 On the other hand U.S. courts did not have any occasion to consider the aspect of the Giannis NK, i.e. ground-nut extraction meal pellets could constitute dangerous goods under Art. IV.6 of Hague/Hague-Visby Rules. 174 It will be interesting to see U.S. courts attitude on the similar case.",

The vessel encountered heavy weather while at sea. A number of containers were lost overboard and some of the remaining containers, including the one with the SDIC, were welded together to prevent loss. On arrival, the ship's crew used a blow torch to cut the containers free and allow their offloading. During the cutting operation, the SDIC in the container ignited, causing a fire and a large amount of smoke. The port and local businesses recovered on nuisance claims against the carrier. The carrier sought recovery from the shipper.

For instance, sulphur chips which corroded the equipment of the ship; 188 bisulfate which was declared as rock salt on the bill of lading and damaged the ship; 189 and raw anthracene which in hot weather released oily, penetrating fluid and thus polluted ship's holds were deemed to be dangerous cargoes. 190 Moreover, in many cases coal and briquettes which selfheated 191 and caused damage were also found dangerous within the meaning of \u00a7 564b. However, it is thought it is doubtful if the same applies in cases where an organic substance such as cotton or tapioca spontaneously ignites at high temperature in combination with moisture. It is contended that the application of \u00a7 564b in such a case is hardly justified. 192 On the other hand, the Court of Appeal held that highly moist zinc residue which became colloidal and caused the danger of capsizing the ship \"Neuwarder Sand\" 193 was not dangerous on the ground that it did not have general properties to exceptionally damage the ship or other cargo; but only particular loading endangered the safety of the ship due to its high moisture content. 194 Similarly, in \"Viking Bank\", excessively moist calcium fluoride concentrate was held not to be dangerous cargo in the sense of \u00a7 564b. It must be noted that this is not to say that the shipper was not liable. 195 In these cases, the shipper's liability was established on the ground of fault under \u00a7 564 instead of application of the special dangerous cargo provision \u00a7 564b, which provides for strict liability. 196 It is also to be noted that by contrast to English law cargoes which damage other goods due to contaminated or infested state or drenching the other goods due to damaged container is not sufficient to be regarded dangerous. 197 It is because in such cases danger arises from concrete state of individual case rather than general.",

GGVSee \u00a7 2(2) set out which cargoes are considered to be dangerous for the purpose of the Regulations. Accordingly, dangerous bulk substances are those which are classified as dangerous in the BC Code. 202 Cargoes in solid form in bulk are considered dangerous which are covered by the IMDG Code, 203 namely cargoes listed in Appendix B of the BC Code, which pose chemical hazards, but not those in Appendix A and C, which affect the stability of the ship.

In both situations, the incurred damage can be quite substantial and the ensuing legal issues highly complex. From the point of view of the carrier, dangerous goods are goods which pose unforeseeable hazards to the ship and cargo. It follows from case law that whether the goods are dangerous or not is subject to an individual evaluation of the occurrence. The court looks at many different factors and it is not sufficient that the goods in question are generally considered dangerous.

Although the knowledge of the carrier and the taking of necessary precautions regarding the dangerous nature of the goods are important factors in allocating liability, using this method to determine whether a good is dangerous or not would not be proper. That is because this approach covers all types of goods, whatever dangers they may create, and treats the category of \"dangerous goods\" as at most non-existent and at least immaterial. 219 It is obvious that any goods may be dangerous or may be regarded as dangerous under certain circumstances, whether or not they are within the codes or may qualify to be within the codes. Any good likewise requires special attention and proper packing; if that is not done, a \"dangerous situation\" may be created.

Indeed, before the Second Word War there was no real demand for special bulk carriers. Seaborne trade of all mineral ores only amounted to 25 million tons in 1937 and this could be carried in conventional tramp ships (freight vessels). By the 1950s, however, movements of bulk cargoes were increasing. Very often ores and other commodities were found far away and the most convenient and cheapest way of shipping them was by sea. Companies in the United States, Europe and increasingly in Japan began to build ships designed exclusively for the carriage of bulk cargoes. As demand increased and shipbuilding technology advanced, these ships tended to become bigger in size and carrying capacity. So the dangers of bulk carriage appeared after the Hague Rules were promulgated. 224 Infra Part 4. 225 Falkanger/Bull/Brautaset, Introduction to Maritime Law (1998), 297.",

A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load virtually instantaneously. -Division 1.2: substances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard. -Division 1.3: substances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard -Division 1.4: substances and articles which present no significant hazard. This division comprises substances which present only a small hazard in the event of ignition during transport. The effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire need not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package. -Division 1.5: very insensitive substances which have a mass explosion hazard.",

Shipton (1923) 1 K.B. 31, the presence of stones in a cargo of barley prevented the cargo from being discharged by spout and delayed the vessel for a day and a half. It was held that the cargo was such that it could be discharged by the appliances normally in use at the discharged port. In Rederi Aktiebolaget Transatlantic v. Board of Trade (1924) 20 L.l.L.Rep. 241, it was held that the charterer was in breach of the implied warranty by loading a cargo of heavy locomotives weighing up to 16 tons when they had been informed before the charterparty was made that the ship's tackle could only lift 5 tons and at the discharging port there was no equipment capable of handling the goods. The distinction between these cases is that in the former case the delay and inconvenience were not of major significance, whereas in the latter case the condition of the cargo caused serious consequences.118  Giannis NK [1994] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 171, 179. 119 Abdul Hamid, Loss or Damage from the Shipment of Goods, Rights and Liabilities of the Parties to the Maritime Adventure (Diss.

            "text": "If the basic liability rule is one of strict liability for one or more parties as against others for all goods, there is no problem of classification. Assuming that the basic rule requires fault, all goods may be treated in a standard way with the duty of care related to the risk. But a problem arises if a different liability is attached because of a degree of danger thought to follow from the carriage of the goods arising from the \"nature\" of the goods. This type of approach makes it possible to apply special rules to a category, but such an approach is only possible if the category is limited and only necessary if distinct liability rules are to apply. These rules may differ from what is standard because of their basis, either strict or fault, or because of the person responsible or both. Moreover, the category must be based on the likelihood of serious damage rather than any inherent danger of the goods. Although a distinction has been clearly recognized by those whose function is to regulate and supervise the carriage of potentially dangerous goods, the distinction has not been so clearly drawn in many cases.It has been asserted that the correct approach is that there should be a general approach to liability in relation to the shipment of goods which cause loss to a carrier without prior qualification of the character of such goods. 226 However, as examined in Part 4, in the current scheme, the basic rule for liability in sea carriage is fault and the application of strict liability is limited. It would not be just and proper to provide a more advantageous position to the carrier compared with the shipper when the basis of the carrier's liability is fault.Accordingly, it is submitted that the meaning of dangerous goods should be understood in the sense of the IMDG Code and other codes in relation to dangerous cargoes, but also should be flexible to comprise new, synthetic goods or goods whose dangers have been recently identified. Given the harsh nature of the strict liability rules, the term \"dangerous\" should be restricted to cargoes constituting significant risks and causing damage therefrom.",
