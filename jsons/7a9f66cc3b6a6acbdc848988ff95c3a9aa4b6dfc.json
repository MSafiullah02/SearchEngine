There was an urgent need to review pre-existing institutional infection control protocols that were established during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS-CoV, in keeping with emerging evidence from the current global outbreak. 3 As the epidemiologic and infectious characteristics of the virus were initially unknown, the task force reviewed and revised infection control protocols based on emerging information. Specific challenges were, firstly, the problem associated with making evidence-based clinical decisions given the lack of published information. There was a need to establish communication channels with staff to facilitate frequent updates. Good communication among medical staff, taskforce stakeholders, institutional senior leadership and health ministry officials is pivotal if ground staff are to obtain timely information, updates and clarifications in a rapidly-evolving situation.",

Prompt identification was needed so that these women could be isolated and treated appropriately, minimising the infection risk to healthcare staff and other patients. This problem arose for several reasons. Firstly, infected patients may be infectious during the incubation period but do not exhibit symptoms or signs of acute infection. 4 Secondly, viral shedding can occur 8-37 days from the onset of symptoms in infected patients. 5 Thirdly, patients may have nonspecific symptoms that are similar to the 'common flu'. 6 These characteristics limit the usefulness of temperature screening prior to admission for labour or caesarean delivery. Screening for travel history may also be unreliable, not only because of under-reporting in some countries, but because as the infection spreads globally, local community transmission occurs. Consequently, all parturients with an acute respiratory tract infection or a positive travel or contact history were considered of high infection-risk and isolated until they tested negative for the virus.",

Early labour epidural analgesia is encouraged to reduce the use of nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation analgesia and also general anaesthesia with airway instrumentation for intrapartum caesarean delivery, both of which are associated with aerosolization of the virus. High-flow oxygen administration via face mask was identified as a factor causing hospital ward outbreaks during the SARS epidemic and should be avoided. 8 However, nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation, where appropriate, is provided to the parturient while awaiting epidural catheter insertion. An experienced anaesthesiologist, donned in PPE against possible aerosol generation from nitrous oxide/oxygen use, should perform the neuraxial procedure to improve the chances of success. Goggle design may limit peripheral vision and visual acuity, hampering the ability to successfully perform the procedure to a greater degree in a novice anaesthesiologist. The decision whether to provide combined spinal-epidural analgesia or epidural analgesia is left to the discretion of the anaesthesiologist.",

However, should an emergency caesarean delivery be required, it is performed in a dedicated negative-pressure operating room with staff donning full PPE. Should this type of room be in use, we proceed with surgery in another operating room, adopting the necessary precautionary measures when accommodating a patient with COVID-19. 9 For cesarean delivery the anaesthetic technique of choice remains neuraxial anaesthesia as this minimises the risk of aerosolisation associated with airway intervention. 10 The authors also prefer a combined spinal-epidural technique if surgery is expected to be prolonged, in order to minimise the risk of a mid-procedure conversion to general anaesthesia.",

Face mask-ventilation is avoided when possible, and if rescue maskventilation is needed in the setting of failed intubation, small tidal volumes used until the cuff on the tracheal tube has been inflated. We advocate the use of disposable equipment (e.g. disposable laryngoscope blades) and consumables. An anaesthetic nurse runner is stationed in the anteroom should further drugs or equipment be required. A difficult airway cart is placed either in the operating room or anteroom.
