Since then SBV has swept across Europe in an unprecedentedly fast epidemic. By summer 2013 the ruminant population of almost all European countries was infected by SBV, and the virus continued to spread eastwards, reaching as far as the Baltic's and Greece (ProMED-mail-reported SBV case on Sept. 23rd, 2013). Despite the high seroprevalence in ruminants in Europe, new SBV cases have been detected in Germany and The Netherlands in 2014 (ProMEDmail no. 20141121.2978286 from November 13th). The origin of the SBV causing the first outbreak in Germany is still not known. In a very recent report (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2014) the presence of SBV antibodies was described in cattle, sheep and goats in Mozambique, Africa, with a seroprevalence between 47 and 100%. Although these findings have to be confirmed, they represent the first indication from where SBV could have been introduced into Europe.",

These symptoms usually last only a few days before the animals recover completely (Beer et al., 2013, Doceul et al., 2013). Adult sheep and goats usually exhibit few clinical signs. However, the most serious impact of SBV is the infection of the fetus in pregnant animals, resulting in abortion or death of newborn calves, lambs and kids (Garigliany et al., 2012). This is often accompanied by extensive malformations of the limbs and in the brain (Hahn et al., 2012). Although domestic and wild ruminants represent the main mammalian host species, the virus can also cause clinical disease in dogs (Sailleau et al., 2013). Although SBV-specific antibodies in wild boars have been reported (Desmecht et al., 2013), a recent study showed that pigs are inefficient hosts for SBV infection and transmission (Poskin et al., 2014).",

However, such an adaptation to cell lines usually represents a bottleneck for infection, increasing the chance that the viral genome acquires mutations.

Notably, all three viruses that had been passaged 10 times in SK-6 cells were placed next to each other and at a shorter distance than the two Belgian SBV \u201cNa-1\u201d and \u201cNa-2\u201d that were sequenced before and after 10 BHK-21 passages.",

            "text": "Usually, SBV is isolated from clinical samples by inoculating KC (insect) or BHK-21 (mammalian) cell cultures. Several passages are required to adapt the virus to the host cells. Coupeau et al. (2013) showed that \u2013 depending on the SBV isolate \u2013 10 to 15 BHK-21 passages were required to obtain maximal titers. In the present study, the porcine SK-6 cell line was used to isolate SBV from sera collected during the peak of the SBV epidemic in Switzerland from viremic, clinically affected cattle (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Compared to BHK-21 cells, SBV isolates replicated in SK-6 cell in a more efficient way; peak titers were obtained already upon the first SK-6 cell passage. This was shown both by determining the infectivity titers (Fig. 1A) as well as by quantifying the viral RNA by an S segment-specific RT-qPCR (Fig. 1B). Cross-titration experiments of SBV-infected SK-6 and BHK-21 cells (Table 3B) yielded infectious virus titers only for SK-6 cells, confirming the high permissiveness of this cell line for SBV propagation. The susceptibility of the SK-6 cell line for SBV infection and propagation was discovered by chance and was unexpected, since a recent study (Poskin et al., 2014) demonstrated that SBV replicates in pigs in an inefficient way, merely leading to a seroconversion in some animals, but no virus could be detected in any clinical sample nor was SBV transmitted to contact animals. This lacking susceptibility of pigs to SBV infection was surprising considering that other members of the Bunyaviridae such as Akabane virus are able to infect pigs in the field (Huang et al., 2003). On the other hand, Kasza et al. (1972) reported that several porcine viruses such as swine influenza, vesicular stomatitis and encephalomyelitis virus could not be propagated in SK-6 cells. However, since SK-6 cells were probably extensively passaged in the past 40 years, it is likely that the phenotype of this cell line has changed. Probably the most significant alteration was the loss of the ability to induce type I interferon upon stimulation with double-stranded RNA (Ruggli et al., 2005). It is likely that this change led to an increase in the susceptibility range, including non-porcine viruses, making it unpredictable which viruses are able to replicate in SK-6 cells. No progeny virus could be isolated from the two samples no. 91.1 and no. 102.2 even after several-fold blind passaging in SK-6 and BHK-21 cells (Table 3A). However, they contained similar amounts of viral RNA (concluded from the similar C\nq values) as the infectious samples. These samples did not contain detectable levels of infectious SBV, and the observed increase of C\nq values represented a dilution effect upon passaging. Unfavorable storage conditions may have inactivated the virus present in these two samples. Nevertheless, the sequence of all three RNA segments could be determined using RNA from the clinical samples. All three isolates used for the serial passaging study rendered similar results (Fig. 1A and B). The appearance of CPE as early as 24 h p.i. and the high titers obtained upon the first passage make it unlikely that the virus required an adaptation phase. The few mutations after 10-fold SK-6 passaging (Fig. 4B) together with the high titer obtained after one cell culture passage in SK-6 cells argues against a selection pressure of the replicating virus. Growth kinetics with SBV from the fourth passage in SK-6 cells at an m.o.i. of 0.1 also demonstrated the efficient SBV replication in SK-6 cells (Fig. 2). A steep increase of infectious virus and viral RNA synthesis was already seen at 4\u20136 h p.i. Plateaus for infectious progeny virus and viral RNA production were reached as early as 15\u201318 h p.i. S segment RNA copy numbers remained stable thereafter demonstrating a high thermostability of SBV RNA at 37 \u00b0C, whereas a one log decrease of progeny virus was seen at the end of the experiment at 72 h p.i. This growth curve sharply contrasted with earlier data using BHK-21-adapted virus and several other cell lines with revealed much slower replication kinetics irrespective of the cell line used (Varela et al., 2013). For performing in vivo pathogenesis studies, SBV viremic serum should preferentially be used as inoculum, since BHK-21-adapted virus titrated in calves yields lower titers than viremic serum (Wernike et al., 2012). However, SK-6 cell-derived virus could be an alternative inoculum, based on the rapid and efficient virus replication. Animal inoculation with passage 10 virus was not done in this study, but based on the few point mutations detected upon 10-fold SK-6 passaging, SBV passaged only a few times might be used as a standardized virus instead of viremic serum for in vivo pathogenesis studies.",

            "text": "The nucleotide sequence of the coding region for the three genome segments from seven Swiss and the German reference strain B80/11-4 were determined by Sanger sequencing. The resulting data were compared to other SBV sequences derived from GenBank, in particular from B80/11-4 that had been determined from viremic serum and was used as reference sequence for this study. For three of the Swiss SBV isolates the genome sequence before any cell culture propagation and after 10 passages in SK-6 cells was also determined to assess the mutation rate of SBV in vitro. All in all 101 individual point mutations were identified, which did not show an obvious distribution pattern but seemed to be randomly dispersed (Fig. 4A). Therefore, no correlation could be established between the number and position of mutations in the individual Swiss SBV isolates and the date and location of their origin. Nevertheless, the M gene sequences from six out of seven Swiss isolates mingled together with some isolates from various locations in Germany (Fig. 5A), making it unlikely that these German SBV isolates represented direct ancestors of the Swiss SBV. In the L segment tree (Fig. 5B) the Swiss SBV formed their own clade, and the NL isolate \u201cHL-1\u201d appeared as nearest neighbor. When the structure of the two trees was compared, similarities in the topology were found, i.e. those viruses from which both the L and the M sequence was available from GenBank (de novo sequenced Swiss isolates and Belgian and Dutch isolates and German reference strain BH80/11-4) appeared in the similar location in the two trees. The only exception was Swiss isolate no. 175.2 which appeared at a clearly different position apart from the remaining Swiss isolates in both dendrograms. Paradoxically, this isolate originated from the same cattle herd as isolate no. 200.2 and the two viruses were collected only 4 days apart. This is an indication that the cattle herd in Liechtenstein got infected simultaneously by two clearly different viruses. Instead of a directional (temporal and geographical) evolution of SBV which is not supported by the data of this study, it is more likely that a pool of numerous slightly different virus strains representing a quasispecies population infected the Swiss ruminant population during the epidemic wave of SBV. Similarity plots of the L and the M segments (Fig. 3A and B) revealed a discrete accumulation of mutations in the central region and in the 3\u2032 terminal area of the M segment. The accumulation of point mutations in the central region was in agreement with the hypervariable region described in previously published studies (Coupeau et al., 2013, Wernike et al., 2012). All mutations found in the L segment and the majority of base exchanges in the M segment were silent. Interestingly, among the seven identified aa changes on the M segment, which were mostly non-conservative, three times a Lys\u2013Glu substitution was found. Furthermore, the same aa mutation was also found twice in the M segment of the 10 times passaged viruses, albeit in different positions. Obviously this mutation is tolerated well by the virus, even though it represents an exchange of a basic by an acidic aa and vice versa.",

On the other hand, back-and-forth transmission of SBV between its mammalian host and insect vector might represent a bottleneck situation, which is likely to limit the number of tolerated mutations considerably and forcing the virus to conserve its genotype in an optimal state for both of its hosts (Jenkins et al., 2002). Generally RNA viruses show mutation rates of between 10\u22124 and 10\u22126 mutations per base per generation (Lauring et al., 2013). Translated into numbers for the SBV genome which is approximately 12 kb in length (made up by the three RNA segments L, M, and S), one would expect a mutation rate ranging from 0.01 to 1 mutation introduction during each RNA strand copying event. Although the majority of these mutations are likely to be deleterious for virus replication, the low number of nt exchanges suggests the presence of a proof-reading mechanism in SBV. Proof-reading mechanisms have been reported for several RNA viruses, e.g. coronaviruses (Denison et al., 2001).",

Furthermore, the low mutation frequency even of the M segment that encodes the viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc (Doceul et al., 2013) was unexpected. Gn and Gc are the most immunogenic proteins of SBV. Under immunological pressure one could expect a much higher mutation rate when comparing field isolates of SBV. However, this was not the case in our study, suggesting that other, hitherto unknown mechanisms could be involved in maintaining the genetic stability of the virus even under immunological pressure. The internally located nucleoprotein, which interacts with the viral RNA and needs to maintain its secondary structure for this interaction, is protected from the humoral immune system. This might be a likely explanation why all S sequences analyzed in this study were identical. However, this finding is in contrast to the data from Fischer et al. (2013) who reported a considerable degree of S sequence heterogeneity among 23 analyzed SBV isolates.",

An additional indication for the low mutation frequency in vitro was the fact that the German reference virus B80/11-4, which had been passaged twice in KC, four times in BHK-21 and once in SK-6 cells (see footnote in Table 1) was still identical to its original sequence derived from viremic serum.",
