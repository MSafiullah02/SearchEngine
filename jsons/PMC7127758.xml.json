These infections are easily transmitted by exposure to infected droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing that can be inhaled, or contaminated hands or surfaces. Symptoms include fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. The new Influenza A (H1N1) appears to be as contagious as seasonal influenza, and spreads rapidly, particularly amongst young people. The severity of the disease ranges from very mild symptoms to serious illness and occasionally even death. The majority of people who contract the virus experience mild disease and recover without antiviral treatment or medical care. Additionally, more than 50% of serious hospitalized cases have underlying health conditions or impaired immune function. Antiviral drugs may reduce the symptoms and duration of illness and may also contribute to preventing severe disease and death. However, the effectiveness and cost of administered therapy remains an interesting topic for further investigation, as a recent Cochrane meta-analysis, although contested, reported a limited effect of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae), a classical antiviral drug (Jefferson et al., 2014), mainly related to the time-limited and usual self-healing nature of the disease.",

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) has reported on the effects of So-cheoug-ryong-tang (Ko et al., 2004) and Yeon-gyo-pae-dok-san on the common cold (Byun et al., 2011). The use of herbs as ailments in the island of Crete has been mentioned since the Bronze Age (Arnott, 1996). Herbal medicine also has a long history in ancient Greece. Popular medical handbooks from the Byzantine era forward incorporated material rooted in ancient medicine and routinely claimed Hippocrates and Galen (among others) as sources (Clark, 2002). In current times, the antioxidant activity of herbs in rural Crete has been investigated and it has been shown that herbal extracts decrease lipid peroxidation in cultured lung cells exposed to iron or ozone (Lionis et al., 2004).",

The biological effects and bioactivity of essential oils and as well as their antibacterial properties have been reported in the literature (Cowan, 1999, Burt, 2004, Bakkali et al., 2008, Koroch et al., 2007). Similarly, the antiviral potential of medicinal plants has been discussed as well (Jassim and Naji, 2003, Mukhtar et al., 2008). It is also exciting that even though the term \u201cvirus\u201d is a very recent term in modern medicine (Silverstein, 2009), these rural societies, without any prior knowledge of the term and in the absence of any immunologic knowledge, were protecting the population using traditional and folk-medicine. As stated above, it was interesting to study to what extent this ethnopharmacological knowledge is evidence-based and effective in virus-induced diseases. To that effort we have also taken into account certain Cretan history and archeological elements, as well as their ethnopharmacological uses in the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East regions, suggesting a beneficial action of such a combination in upper respiratory viral infections (Dafni et al., 1984, Honda et al., 1996, Lev and Amar, 2002, Said et al., 2002, Hanlidou et al., 2004, Lardos, 2006, Hudaib et al., 2008).",

Rchb. f. synonym of Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav.), dictamnus or Cretan dittany (Origanum dictamnus L.) and sage (Salvia fruticosa Mill., Salvia pomifera L.) extracts through steam distillation. Analysis of essential oils was performed by Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectroscopy, in a GC\u2013MS, Shimadzu, QP 5050A apparatus. GC was equipped with MDN-5 column (length 30 m, film thickness 0.25 \u00b5m, diameter 0.25 mm, max. useable temperature 325 \u00b0C) and a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer as detector. MDN-5 column temperature was initially 50 \u00b0C for 5 min. It was then gradually increased to 150 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C/min and kept for 10 min, and finally increased to 280 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C/min and held for 20 min. The carrier gas was helium, the flow rate 0.9 mL/min. 2 \u03bcL was used as an injection volume. The sample was measured in a split mode procedure with a split ratio 1:35. Injector and detector were maintained at 230 and 250 \u00b0C, respectively. For GS\u2013MS detection an electron ionization system was used with ionization energy at 70 eV.

The Jackson criteria were used in order to identify patients suffering from common cold (Jackson et al., 1958). These criteria consist of sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, headache, malaise and chilliness. A patient was considered as eligible for participation when the Jackson score was greater or equal than two (with at least one of the first four \u2018cold-specific\u2019 symptoms present). Patients on a daily dosage of acetylsalicylic acid greater than 100 mg were excluded from the study. Further criteria for exclusion were the presence of malignancy, immunosuppression and pregnancy. Harakas Health Center serves a population of 12,284, in rural Crete. Of the 11 General Practitioners (GPs) practicing at the Centre, 10 agreed to participate.

Severity of symptoms over the study period was compared between intervention and control groups, using the 19-item WURSS-21 scores, with both univariate techniques and multiple linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex, initial CRP level, body mass index (BMI) and the presence of chronic diseases. Severity was assessed in three ways: (a) firstly, the average total WURSS-21 score over the time period was compared between groups (i.e. the sum of daily WURSS-21 scores). (b) Differences between the 2 groups were assessed by calculating the area under the time\u2013severity curve (the y-axis being the WURSS-21 score). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using a trapezoidal approximation. (c) Finally, the average maximum WURSS score (for each subject) was compared between groups. The percentage of missing values for the daily WURSS-21 scores ranged from 2.8% (n=3 out of 108 at baseline) to 6.5% (n=7 out of 108 on day three). Confidence intervals for median daily scores were calculated using a binomial method (the centile command in Stata 12). Multiple linear regression models were applied, with dependent variable the natural logarithm of the AUC [ln(AUC)] and independent variables the treatment (intervention/placebo), age (in years), BMI (kg/m2), gender (male/female), presence of chronic illnesses (yes/no) and CRP-level upon presentation (\u22650.8 mg/dL vs \u22640.8 mg/dL). Discrete-time survival analysis was used to assess possible differences in time to symptom cessation (i.e. symptom duration) between groups. Symptoms were considered absent on the first day in which the WURSS score dropped to zero. An intention-to-treat approach was used. A complementary log\u2013log model (a discrete time proportional hazards model) was also applied to our data. The model was estimated by maximum likelihood adjusting for age and sex (Stata command cloglog). The proportions of initially CRP-positive subjects who were CRP-negative at the end of the study were compared between groups.

An interest in the effectiveness of herbal remedies in treating or preventing influenza or influenza-like illness has been acknowledged; however, a systematic review performed in 5 databases until 2006 reported 14 RCTs and concludes that the majority of performed studies concern small groups, assayed with questionable methodologies or they report clinically irrelevant effects (Guo et al., 2007). Another systematic review (Wu et al., 2008), searching the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews, about the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs in treating acute respiratory infections, came to similar conclusions. The authors also reported lack of quality in the researched trials and the presence of certain biases that have an impact on study validity (Wu et al., 2008). A recent Chinese RCT (Wang et al., 2010) described the mean symptom population scores, as well as the number of recovered patients, as primary endpoints for treating influenza patients while one of the secondary endpoints included the time required to alleviate both fever and the severity of clinical symptoms (Wang et al., 2010).",

This may explain the high number of patients without a virus-infection (resulting in a sample size far lower than that required to detect a medium\u2013large effect size\u2014see Methods). The possible inclusion of non-infectious diseases could seriously have affected the design of the study that assumed a high proportion of patients with virus infection.

Our sample is limited in size (~100 participants) and becomes even smaller when focussing on patients with a documented viral infection. Even in the sub-sample of virus positive patients, our sample was very heterogeneous as several types of viruses were identified. However, the effect of our extract might be underestimated, since a sample of 48 subjects with a virus-documented infection does not provide enough statistical power, to respond to the question of the potency of our preparation in a large spectrum of common cold and influenza viruses.
