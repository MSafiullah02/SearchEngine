Binding of this antibody to the viral peplomers was visualised by electron microscopy with indirect two-step immunogold labelling. SARS coronavirus from the supernatant of infected Vero cells was adsorbed to copper grids coated with carbon and Pioloform, which were incubated with the monoclonal antibodies by floating on droplets for 30 min at room temperature. Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected by incubation on droplets of anti-human-IgG-gold-5 nm conjugates (British Biocell, Cardiff, UK). The grids were negative contrasted with 1% uranyl acetate and assessed with a ZEISS EM 10 A transmission electron microscope (figure 1A, 1B\n). CR3014 was shown to react with the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus: HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid-expressed, codon-optimised full-length glycoprotein spike, and stained with CR3014 and an R-phycoerythrin-labelled second antibody after 48 h using standard procedures for FACS-analysis (figure 1C). CR3014 was also shown to neutralise SARS coronavirus in vitro: triplicate wells of Vero cells were infected with 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of SARS coronavirus strain HK-39849, and pre-incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with different concentrations of CR3014 or control antibody. The presence or absence of a cytopathic effect was scored in each well on day 5 after infection, and the percentage of protected wells was noted (figure 1D).",

Two animals from each of the four groups were killed on days 4 and 7 and necropsies were done according to a standard protocol.

If CR3014 reduced the replication of SARS coronavirus in people to the same extent as in ferrets, and in view of the serum halflife of up to 20 days for IgG1 in human beings, one intramuscular administration of CR3014 at the dose used in this study should protect an adult for the length of at least one to two SARS coronavirus incubation periods (median 4\u20136 days). Passive immunisation with CR3014 might, therefore, be a feasible approach to prevent lung manifestations in people exposed to SARS coronavirus, and prevent person-to-person spread of the virus by abolishment of viral shedding in pharyngeal secretions.",

One animal in the CR3014 group, indicated by open circles, shed virus. (C) All CR3014-treated ferrets were free from macroscopic lung pathology, whereas all control ferrets showed multifocal lesions. (D) Left formalin-fixed lung (inflated with formalin by intrabronchial intubation)of a control ferret, with multifocal lesions (asterisks).",
