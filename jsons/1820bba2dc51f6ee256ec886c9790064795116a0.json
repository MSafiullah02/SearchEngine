Sequence alignment indicated a 75.9% amino acid sequence identity between the S protein of SARS-CoV and that of 2019-nCoV (Supplementary Figure S1 , Supplementary Table S1). SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) WIV1 and Rs3367 have 92.3% amino acid sequence identity to SARS-CoV in S protein, while those between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 28.7% (Supplementary Figure S1 , Supplementary Table S1). It is worth noting that the RBDs of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV exhibited a significant difference, although they bind the same receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2) during virus infection (Zhou et al. 2020) . Therefore, despite sequence and receptor similarities, it is unclear whether the anti-SARS-CoV serum produced by immunization with S protein-based vaccine could cross-neutralize 2019-nCoV infection.",

These pseudoviruses (PsVs) bear the S protein and a defective HIV-1 genome, including a luciferase reporter gene, and could simulate the virus to infect target cells, thus having native conformations ( Fig. 1A ) (Xia et al. 2019) . Consequently, we believed these PsVs to be potential immunogens to produce neutralizing antibodies. Female Balb/C mice (n = 5) were subcutaneously injected with SARS-PsV, MERS-PsV or PBS as a control using Freund's complete adjuvant for the prime immunization and vaccinated at 1B) . Sera samples were collected from day 7 after the final vaccination.",

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the low titer of the crossneutralizing antibody is due to the low density of S protein on the surface of pseudovirus particles. Furthermore, modifying or reconstructing the SARS-CoV S protein may enhance the exposure of conformational neutralizing epitopes in RBD, in order to increase its immunogenicity for eliciting higher cross-neutralizing antibody responses against 2019-nCoV and emerging/reemerging coronaviruses in the future.",
