Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an end-product formed during oxidative stress, concretely lipid peroxidation [4,5]. It is one of several products formed during the degradation of cellular membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid (AA) is released due to the action of phospholipase (PL)-A2. Subsequently, AA is attacked by reactive species of oxygen (ROS) (principally the hydroxyl radical OH\u2022) from mitochondria through a non-enzymatic reaction and lipid endoperoxide is formed. This lipid endoperoxide undergoes spontaneous rupture and MDA is formed in the intracellular space (Figure 1). MDA is released into extracellular space and finally into the blood. MDA has been used as an effective biomarker of lipid oxidation for more than 30 years.",

Serum MDA levels were measured using the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) method as described by Kikugawa et al. [16]. The pink complex of samples was extracted in n-butanol. Each sample was placed in a 96-well plate and read at 535 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer reader (Benchmark Plus, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The detection limit of this assay was 0.079 nmol/ml; the intra- and inter-assay CV were 1.82% and 4.01%, respectively. The serum concentration of MDA was expressed in nmol/ml. To avoid the possible dispersion of serum MDA level results, all the samples were processed at the same time, at the end of the recruitment process.

            "text": "We found that serum MDA levels were associated with septic mortality, which suggests imbalance in the oxidant state. The imbalance favoring the oxidant state in non-surviving patients could lead to an increase of free radicals and these may contribute to cellular dysfunction, organ failure and finally death [19,20]. The use of melatonin has reduced mortality rate in septic animal models [21-23] and in patients [24-26]. In the study by Fulia et al., 20 asphyxiated newborns were randomized to receive melatonin; and patients treated with melatonin showed lower MDA and serum nitrite/nitrate (associated with vasodilatation) levels and lower mortality [24]. In the study by Gitto et al., 20 septic newborns were randomized to receive melatonin; those treated with melatonin showed lower serum MDA and 4-hydroxylalkenals (another lipid peroxidation product) levels and lower mortality [25]. In the study by Sahib et al., 180 burn patients were randomized to receive different antioxidants (vitamins E and C, zinc sulphate, allopurinol, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine); and the patient groups receiving antioxidants showed higher serum glutathione (that is, a natural antioxidant) levels, and lower serum MDA levels and mortality rate [26]. These findings suggest that the development of modulators of the antioxidant/oxidant state could be used as a new class of drugs for the treatment of severe sepsis; however, more research is necessary to demonstrate these potential benefits. On the other hand, melatonin has been found to play an important role in various functions of the body, including immunoregulation, free radical scavenging, as well as having antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects [27-31]. It is, therefore, not possible to conclude whether the potential benefits of melatonin are due to its antioxidant effect or due to the combination of all its effects. We found that serum MDA levels were associated with septic mortality; however, it is as yet not possible to affirm that the use of an antioxidant, even if it does lower serum MDA levels, may reduce septic mortality.",

            "text": "The strengths of our study are the large sample size and the follow-up of serum MDA levels throughout the first week after diagnosis. However, some limitations of our study should be recognized. First, the sample size of the study was not pre-determined. Second, the patients were not consecutively included since the study required the collaboration of the research team in each participating hospital and it was not possible to include all septic patients admitted to each ICU; thus, this represents a potential selection bias. Third, we have not reported data on patients lost to follow-up and consent rate. Fourth, the measure of other compounds of oxidant and antioxidant states would be desirable in order to better evaluate this balance. Fifth, the control subjects were recruited from only one center participating in the study, the Hospital Universitario de Canarias (La Laguna, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain); however, they were selected on the basis of non-exposure to antioxidant agents. Sixth, the study lacks some well-established markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein or procalcitonin, and it could be interesting to analyze the association between MDA and these biomarkers. Seventh, we did not analyze MDA levels in other critically ill patients to determine whether they could be used as a prognostic biomarker in non-septic critical patients. Eighth, we did not take into account variability in timing of sepsis diagnosis between patients. Ninth, there was a large overlap in serum MDA values between survivors and non-survivors, even though the medians were statistically different; thus, although MDA levels can help to predict 30-day mortality, their clinical utility for an individual patient should be taken with caution. Finally, the association between MDA levels and early septic mortality does not support the notion that antioxidant therapy will decrease mortality.",
