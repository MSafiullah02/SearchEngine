We believe and recommend that the latest emerging technologies be urgently adopted at the global level, and the governments need to reinvest resources in making healthy nations, not powerful nations. Significantly more investment in healthcare is the need of the day, especially in preventive medicine, community health and disaster management. The most critical asset in fighting this disease is our frontline doctors and healthcare workers. However, unfortunately, our system has failed in saving them from this infection also.

To avoid coming in contact with human beings and physical objects, which may be potentially infected, several innovative and emerging technologies are being considered by the healthcare, authorities to protect their workers and also to deliver the treatment and other facilities to the needy patients [4, 5] .",

Agencies can quickly get precise positions of locations to undertake relief and rehabilitation efforts accordingly. Smartphone-based application software is developed and used to identify the movement of people and resources and even to determine if they are in contact with an infected individual. The software is used to model and optimize the supply chain with the latest algorithms. However, this needs an upgraded telecommunication infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. Molecular technologies with supercomputing facilities are trying to deliver the vaccine as early as possible. Table 1 here\" Several engineering-based innovative and modern technologies need to be used to fight back this pandemic effectively. Recent practices have proven that new-generation technologies have huge advantages, and they are the building blocks for Industry 4.0. Thus, we see an essential role of these technologies in responding to this global emergency of public health challenges [6] [7] [8] . An optimal help of the digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, molecular biology, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, blockchain, additive manufacturing, 5G and many more of such technologies are urgently needed to effectively improve the efficiency of the global efforts in epidemic monitoring, virus tracking, prevention, control, treatment, resource allocation and vaccine development. COVID-19 pandemic has to be fought on the war level, with the latest technological innovations. Industry 4.0 (also known as the 4 th industrial revolution) has now started, and the medical world has to gear up to come forward to embrace these emerging and promising strategies and implementing Medicine 4.0. \u2022 All necessary information is stored at a computing platform and made available, to enables an enormous amount of computing power to the users with the help of the internet and helps in making real-time decisions in disease modelling. Software can be employed with blockchain and other tools to model requirements of critical facilities at a different level, from the hospital to the nation. 3 Big Data \u2022 Provide storage capacity for extensive data of the population in a format that can be used efficiently for analysis and necessary action can be taken towardsthe prevention of disease transmission, movement, health monitoring and prevention system 4 Telemedicine \u2022 A patient can have a consultation from well-trained professionals on their medical conditions through video calls, avoiding the need for a hospital visit and thus helping the social distancing and man-to-man contact and disease transmission.
