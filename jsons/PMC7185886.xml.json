However, in some areas, especially in developing countries these infectious cases often appear. We take SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as an example. From November in 2002 to May in 2003, the firstly familial aggregation case occurred in China and then the SARS showed the tendency of a rapid spread. SARS cases were found in more than 30 countries and regions around the world which threaten globally human health  [1]. In February 2013, a new type of avian influenza, H7N9, appeared in Mainland China which caused more than 100 people to be infected  [2]. As a result, it is also necessary to investigate the mechanisms of disease spreading.",

The transmission or other interactions formation of many important epidemiological phenomenon are largely affected by space interaction  [3], [4] and thus many studies have proposed spatial epidemic models. In these studies, the reaction\u2013diffusion equations have been used which belong to temporal and spatial forms. The reaction term is the process of individuals changes or the interaction among species in the absence of diffusion, and the diffusion term describes the spatial movement of individuals  [5], [6].",
