The 229E, HKU1, OC43 and NL63 are gently pathogenic CoVs, leading to 10-30% of upper respiratory tract infections (3, 4) . Instead, the extremely pathogenic CoVs, containing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), mostly contaminate lower airways and lead to pneumonia (5) . Given that the clinical signs of2019 nCoV, SARS CoV, and MERS CoV have some resemblances, it can range from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory illnesses (6) . The rapid prevalence of the novel type of CoV reminds us that it is a major global health threat. Chen Y, et al. think that severe prevalence of novel CoV in the future is inevitable as climate is changing and human exposure to animals is increasing; therefore, the need for effective treatment modalities and training for CoVs is necessary (2) .",

This theory may be indicating that 2019-nCoV uses the same SARS-CoV mechanism i.e. through angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease to infect the human cells. Coronavirus spike (S) protein facilitates virus entry into target cells. The binding of SARS to the receptor and its entry into the cell depends on a cellular protease (19) . Sequence analysis has shown that some of the 2019-nCoV clusters and bat-associated SARS76 CoV viruses (SARSr-CoV) can use the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell. Analysis of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and a part of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with ACE2, revealed that most of the essential amino acid residues were retained at 2019-nCoV for ACE2 binding, but in the SARSr-CoV S proteins were not observed. It was found that it does not use ACE2 for entry into the cells and need priming the S protein for binding to ACE2 (20) . It has been reported that entry of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells may block via a clinical antagonist of the TMPRSS2, a cellular serine protease, that is recruited via SARS-CoV-2 to S protein priming.",

To enter the virus into host cells and covers S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2032 sites, the need to specific proteases in the host cells for priming of coronavirus S proteins (26) . The cutting site of SARS-2-S, several arginine residues (multibasic) that shows high sensitivity for cutting. Actually, into the host cells, SARS-2-S was proficiently cleaved, fallowing by cleaved S protein was incorporated into vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles. Notably, the area in which the incision has occurred can define the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses (27, 28) ; the SARS-CoV100 2 and coronavirus have the most closely associated. SARS-CoV can use endosomal cysteine protease to priming S-protein in TMPRSS2 negative cells. Nevertheless, priming of protein S via TMPRSS2 protease is required for virus entry into target cells, and the spread of the virus in infected host cells (29) .",

In the case of severe infection, it might lead to expiration of the patients due to severe alveolar injury and advanced respiratory failure (42, 43) . However, post-mortem biopsy might be taken from the liver, heart, and lung tissues. In the lung histological studies, bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudate might be seen. Patent desquamation of the pneumocytes and hyaline membrane construction in the right lung has also been seen to demonstrate acute respiratory failure (44) . On the other hand, biopsy assay in the left lung exhibited pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane construction. In the whole lung tissues, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates occur mostly by lymphocytes. Furthermore, syncytial cells with abnormal puffy pneumocytes characterized via bulky nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and noticeable nucleoli in the intra-alveolar spaces were recognized. These features display viral cytopathic-like variations (45) . Pneumonia patients with initial stage lung X-ray analysis demonstrate several small patchy shadows and interstitial variations significant in the lung periphery (6) . In patients with severe disease, more progress to bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity, infiltrating shadows, and pulmonary merging, with rare pleural effusion, can be seen. In both lungs of the youngsters with severe disease, multiple lobar lesions may be observed (46) . Moreover, biopsy of the liver indicated modest microvascular steatosis and slight lobular activity; nevertheless, there was no definite proof to support 2019-nCoV contamination or drug-induced liver damage as a result. Subsequently, biopsy observations showed that no clear histological variations were seen in the heart tissue, proposing that 2019-nCoV contamination might not directly damage the heart (47) . A radiograph of an infected person's chest is shown in Figure 2 , as an example. (Table 4 ). In addition, different companies are working hard for produce vaccine; experts estimate it could take between 12-18 months to develop a vaccine ready for market. Supplementary Table 1 recommended. Certain drugs such as methylprednisolone intravenously (1-2 mg/kg/d) are suggested for 3-5 d, but not for long-term consumption (47, (50) (51) (52) (53) . In severe patients, immunoglobulin can also be recommended intravenously. The suggested dose is 1.0 g/kg/d for 2 d, or 400 mg/kg/d for 5 d (51, 54, 55) . In patients with blood circulation problems, drugs that are vasoactive can be used for recovering microcirculation on the basis of sufficient liquid intake (47) . Cases who had acute renal damage should be given kidney tests function. In children, if intracranial hypertension and convulsion happens, there is a need to decrease the intracranial pressure and control convulsion to be suitable (54, 55) . There is speculation that patients with 2019-nCoV who are receiving ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes (56, 57) . The ACE2 is a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and reninangiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors can increase the ACE2 levels (58) . Finally, in the patients who had respiratory complication despite nasal catheter or mask oxygenation, heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC), non-invasive ventilation such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or non-invasive high-frequency ventilation can be used. If improvement is not possible, mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation and a protective lung ventilation strategy should be adopted (46) .

This information is updated weekly at the Situation Report site of the Regulatory Focus\u2122 (https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/aboutregulatory-focus). However, some approaches have been suggested to prevent further spread of the infection and controlling 2019-nCoV. In the first step, suspected persons should be isolated and kept separately and the severe and acute patients should be detected as soon as possible. During therapeutic measurements, patients need more attention and their vital symptoms, pO2, pCO2, arterial pH, etc. should be regularly checked. Then, the general treatments are started which include resting and supportive therapeutics; adequate calorie and water consumption; keeping water electrolyte balance; and homeostasis. Some treatments are antiviral such as, interferon-\u03b12b nebulization 100,000-400,00 IU/kg) in addition to lopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/50 mg) (47-49). Furthermore, antibiotics are also used, but illogical usage of antibiotics should be prevented, and rarely the usage of immunomodulation drugs such as corticosteroids should be applied carefully in common types of infection. In certain conditions, rapid lung radiography and confirmation of the incidence of ARDS, observation of clear toxic signs such as encephalitis or encephalopathy, hemophagocytic syndrome and other severe problems, observation of septic shock, and eventually clear wheezing indications are",

            "text": "-F. Rossignol at 2016 presented nitazoxanide as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent for Flu and other viral respiratory infections; this drug is undergoing clinical progress. In vitro studies on nitazoxanide showed its efficient function against MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses by inhibiting expression of the viral N protein. He has also declared that the clinical trials and post-marketing experience approve nitazoxanide as an attractive drug candidate for treatment of MERS-CoV (59). There is a hope that nitazoxanide may be effective for treatment of 2019-nCoV through similar mechanisms. Conclusion The high prevalence of the 2019-nCoV has become a global clinical problem these days. However, we do not know much about precision mechanism and function of this new virus at present. Various pharmaceutical companies around the world are working hard to find effective drug and vaccine against this virus. Until then, we must carefully follow WHO health measures to control infection and prevent further transmission of the virus. On the other hand, it is expected that different countries in this current crisis abandon political disputes, share information, and work unitedly against 2019-nCoV all over the world to combat this life-threatening disease of mankind.",
