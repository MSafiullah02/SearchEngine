The highest proportions of rare species also happen to be found in these groups. The rarest weeds among these species tend to be late-winter and early-summer annuals, while the rare species of stubble fields tend to be broad-leaved with low nitrogen requirements, small seeds and short height. Stubble fields showed a decline in weed cover with increasing application of fertilizer and distance from the field edge, but we could detect no strong associations of management factors with trait composition, perhaps because the intensification gradient across these fields was shorter.",

Recent advances in multivariate techniques (Lehsten et al. 2009; Pillar et al. 2009 ) allow a functional approach to arable weed ecology (Booth & Swanton 2002) that is sensitive to divergent assembly patterns as well as convergent ones (Garnier & Navas 2012) . This means detecting, for example, not just changes in average community attributes, such as desiccation tolerance or nitrogen requirement, but also changes in the distribution of attributes such as germination time or seed weight. This is especially important in arable weed ecology, because many agricultural interventions impose disruptive filters that select against certain attributese.g. a particular germination periodrather than selecting for any particular attribute. Another advantage of multivariate techniques is their ability to detect correlative patterns of interacting attributes that may together constitute syndromes for weed persistence in the face of multi-faceted weed control regimes. There is great potential for exploring the diversity of patterns in weed functional trait responses to such management filters as the timing of interventions, levels of fertilizer, types of herbicide and depth of tillage (Storkey et al. 2010; Gunton et al. 2011; Trichard et al. 2013 )and such patterns may be intrinsic to the community assembly rules of arable vegetation.",

            "text": "We might expect that filters and the trait attributes they select for will co-vary along an axis of intensification. Key features of extensive cropping are high proportion of cereals in the rotation, low sowing density, use of locally saved seed, shallow tillage, limited fertilizer and no pesticide application, and late ploughing of stubble (Hofmeister 1992) . Some recent studies suggest that weeds found in more extensive systems tend to be shorter plants, producing larger seeds and flowering later than species found in more intensive systems (Lososov a et al. 2006; Navas 2012) , while management factors in Dutch meadows had strong associations with species' seed mass and height (Jamil et al. 2013) . We may also expect traits to be directly associated with species' rarity status. A 'rare weed trait syndrome' of short stature, large seeds and late flowering was identified in winter wheat fields in the UK (Storkey et al. 2010) . Increasing cereal weeds in France were found to be smaller plants that also had small seeds and long germination periods (Fried et al. 2012) , whereas in French sunflower fields increasing weeds were characterized by tall stature, preference for nitrogen, late germination and late flowering (Fried et al. 2009a) . The most abundant arable weed species in Central Europe were found to flower in early spring, with high nutrient requirement and relative shade tolerance (Lososov a et al. 2008) . These studies suggest that rare and common weed trait syndromes could be crop-as well as region-specific. Alternatively, we may need to explore more general syndromes by accounting for interactions among traits and non-monotonic relationships with environmental factors.",

We then use some weed traits hypothesized to respond to arable intensification to compare the two types of cereal field, looking for both convergent multi-trait patterns and divergent multitrait syndromes based on functional classification. Similarly, in the stubble data we look at the functional patterns most associated with management factors.

First, 60 cereal fields were surveyed in four geographical regions of western Hungary (Fig. 1) between May and Jun 2007, at the seasonal peak of cereal weed vegetation ). These four regions are important centres of traditional farming methods that are now in decline, allowing us to select 20 fields that were extensively managed according to the criteria of Hofmeister (1992) and general socioeconomic context (M arkus 1994) . Alongside these we selected 40 intensively managed fields, giving two contrasting field types that were evenly distributed among the regions, all cropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum), triticale (Triticale rimpaui) or barley (Hordeum vulgare and H. distichon). The extensively managed fields were small (<1.8 ha) and had not been treated with herbicides in the 5-10 yrs before the survey, as indicated by regular observations over 1993-2006, and no signs of spraying machinery or weed injury were detected. The intensively managed fields, by contrast, ranged in size from 0.18 to 200 ha (median: 11 ha) and were characterized by annual herbicide applications in recent years. In most cases it was not possible to find and interview the landowners of extensive fields, so we simply used the management type as a predictor variable. Weed vegetation in the fields was assessed in ten randomly located 1-m 2 quadrats located just inside the outermost seed drill line, by a field edge that bordered on grassland. The minimum distance between quadrats was 3 m, and all quadrats fell within a maximum distance of 150 m. Percentage ground cover of each noncrop plant species was estimated visually and then averaged across the ten quadrats for each field.",

The crop species included the above cereals plus rye (Secale cereale), oat (Avena sativa) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Weed vegetation was generally more patchy here and was sampled in four randomly located 50-m 2 quadrats within each field: one at a field edge, another towards the centre, up to 300 m away, and the remaining two quadrats arbitrarily spaced between these. Percentage ground cover of each weed species was again assessed, for each quadrat. For each field, data for four management factors were obtained directly from the farmers: sowing date (22 Aug-10 Apr), tillage depth (range 0-50 cm), amount of nitrogen fertilizer (range 0-261 kg\u00c1ha \u00c01 ) and total amount of active herbicide ingredients (range 0-1425 g\u00c1ha \u00c01 ). We thus used five predictor variables, all related to intensification: fertilizer and herbicide input, which each have direct effects on weed growth ",

Plant stature, seed weight and flowering period are attributes of the 'rare weed trait syndrome' proposed by Storkey et al.

Ellenberg indicator values for light and nitrogen, as rescaled for the Hungarian Flora (Borhidi 1993) , may indicate the viability of weed species experiencing competition in fertilized crops (Kleijn & vanderVoort 1997) . The lifeform classification of Raunkiaer has been extended by Ujv arosi (1973) with four therophyte categories: earlywinter, late-winter, early-summer and late-summer annuals, according to the duration and peak month of germination period. This classification reflects phenology, suggesting whether species can regenerate following various sowing and cultivation operations and herbicide applications (Fried et al. 2012) ; it also reflects mode of perennation, which may determine resilience to tillage to varying depths (Hunyadi et al. 2011 ). This gave seven functional traits: six quantitative and one categorical. Finally, we also used the classical distinction between broad-leaf and grass weeds (hereafter termed 'the grass indicator'), which may be strongly connected to tolerance to the herbicides used in cereal crops (Nov ak et al. 2011 ). (We attributed the pteridophyte Equisetum arvense as 'grass' for this purpose, since it is generally susceptible only to broad-spectrum herbicides, like grass weeds in cereal crops.) This binary trait may be considered as quantitative for describing the mean proportion of grass weeds at a site, as well as providing an a priori categorical dichotomy in any functional grouping.",

            "text": "1. We first looked at total weed cover and proportional cover of rare species for each survey unit (cereal field, or quadrat in a stubble field). In the cereal field survey data, we compared each of these variables between intensively and extensively managed fields using one-way ANOVA for each variable. Total weed cover was log-transformed to give normal residuals; proportion of rare species was arcsine square root-transformed and, because 15% of fields had no rare species, significance was assessed using a randomization test (999 permutations of the field type indicator). Similarly, for the stubble data, we modelled the same variables in response to the four management factors and the distance of quadrats from the field edge (using squareroot transformations of distance, fertilizer and herbicide). This required multi-level models: the management factors were specified for each field, so field was modelled as a random factor, with the effect of distance from the field edge allowed to vary among fields (which improved model fits). Weed cover did not require transformation in this case, but for proportion of rare species, 64% of the data were zero so, as before, we used the arcsine square root transformation and assessed the significance of t-statistics for the coefficient of each predictor using randomization tests (permuting the quadrats to test the distance effect, and permuting whole fields to test the other effects). 2. We then characterized weed responses to management variables using functional trait analyses based on trait-convergence and trait-divergence assembly patterns with the method of Pillar et al. (2009) . This method is based on Mantel correlations (congruences) of multivariate distance matrices describing the variation among quadrats. Distances are based on (1) mean values of traits of the species found in each quadrat; (2) abundance of certain functional types in each quadrat; and (3) values of specified environmental variables (in our case, field management variables) associated with each quadrat. Trait-convergence assembly patterns (TCAPs) are simply assessed using the congruence between the trait means distance matrix (1) and the environmental distance matrix (3); they are most appropriate for quantitative traits and can reveal associations of local (field-level) mean trait values with certain environmental variables. Trait-divergence assembly patterns (TDAPs), on the other hand, concern how syndromes of functional traits (categorical as well as quantitative) are related to the environment. TDAPs consider trait variation within a local community (quadrat), rather than trait means, and must be based on classifications of species into functional groups. Thus a TDAPs method uses the relative local abundances of functional groups (in each quadrat) to compute a compositional distance matrix (2) to compare with the environmental distance matrix (3). Unless a classification is pre-defined, an iterative procedure is used, based on a standard classification algorithm and specification of a range of degrees of grouping, to compare a wide range of functional classifications. Following Gunton et al. (2011) , we used an agglomerative clustering algorithm, compared numbers of groups between three and eight (classifications with two groups risk conflating TDAPs with TCAPs), and tested all possible combinations of traits. Partial matrix correlation was used to remove the influence of trends in trait mean values before computing congruences with the environmental distance matrix (Pillar et al. 2009 ).",

Similarly, we applied the TDAPs algorithm iteratively to these traits plus the life-form classification, to find an optimal functional classification that could resolve differences between the two field types. For each analysis, we compared the best congruence values obtained for each number of traits against corresponding values derived from repeating the whole TCAPs or TDAPs procedure on 999 sets of randomized trait data. This stratified randomization approach allowed the best congruence values for each number of traits to be corrected by subtracting the median of corresponding maximum values obtained from randomized data and re-scaling the result between 0 and 1. The maximum of these corrected values (which would be negative if out-performed by more than 50% of randomized data sets) identified the best model. The original congruence value for this model was then compared to the 999 comparable randomized values to find its quantile and thus assess its overall statistical significance, accounting for the iterative selection procedure ('data dredging'), giving a conservative test of a null hypothesis of no association. For the stubble data, we investigated functional differences among fields with differing management regimes in the same way, but using mean cover values of each weed species calculated across the four quadrats from each field (and dropping field edge distance from the analyses, after it was found to be unimportant in preliminary analyses). We compared each of the management variables alone and then proceeded to combine variables that gave the strongest congruences.",

Other correlations were no higher than AE0.35. Spatial autocorrelation could also affect our tests for statistical significance, so where significant results were found, we plotted empirical variograms to check this (see Results for details). 3. Finally, to examine rare weed syndromes, we analysed our species trait tables to look for direct relationships between species rarity status and their traits, without using relev e data. Separate analyses were performed for the species found in the cereal survey and for those found in the stubble survey. We looked for correlational patterns using the TCAPs algorithm, and for syndromes using the TDAPs algorithm, with species' rarity status providing the 'environmental' table and a dummy diagonal matrix in place of the relev e table. For the cereal species, the environmental table comprised two columns, one for overall rarity and one for Red List status; for the stubble species, we simply used overall rarity status, as there were only two Red List species.

Groups 1 and 2 have the shortest flowering duration (range: 2-5 mo); group 1 also has the highest seed weight (10-310 mg), whereas group 2, which is actually the most abundant type in extensive fields, has one of the lowest seed weights (\u22641.3 mg).

Higher diversity of weeds in extensively managed fields (Hawes et al. 2010; Jos e-Mar \u0131a et al. 2010; Armengot et al. 2012; Kol arov a et al. 2013 ) is generally attributed to a lack of herbicide application and reduced amounts of fertilizer (Cirujeda et al. 2011; Rassam et al. 2011; Andreasen & Stryhn 2012; P al et al. 2013; Salonen et al. 2013) , and our results emphasize the value of such systems for rare and threatened arable weed species in Hungary. Only a few traditional extensively managed small fields remain in Hungary, and they are continuously being abandoned or intensified, making the persistence of these valuable habitats uncertain ). The communities of our extensive and intensive cereal fields were distinguished by a range of trait syndromes, which suggests some disruptive filters in community assembly. In the intensive communities, for example, longer potential flowering periods were typical, allowing a range of phenologies to cope with management interventions such as herbicide application, as also found by Fried et al. (2012) . Also, the mixture of short (<60 cm) and tall (>100 cm) species could reflect competitive exclusion of weeds of similar height to cereal crops. The communities of extensive fields, meanwhile, had divergent seed weights (mostly <1.3 mg and >10 mg), which probably become less viable under the competitive conditions of sustained intensive arable management. Larger seed weight may be disadvantageous because it entails production of fewer seedlings, and whatever advantages are conferred on these by being initially larger do not pertain under herbicide spraying (Navas 2012 ). In addition, seed size is negatively correlated with persistence in the seed bank (Thompson et al. 1993) , so large-seeded species quickly disappear under unfavourable conditions, while they are also excluded by seed cleaning technologies (Hilbig & Bachthaler 1992) . Small seeds are also selected against by modern seed cleaning, and we note that the range of seed size in the two groups associated with intensive fields (0.1-43 mg) spans the seed size range of cereals cropped in the fields. There may also be a tendency for small-seeded species to disperse into extensively managed fields from the more natural dry meadows that are often nearby.",

Our study of stubble fields considered four of Hofmeister's (1992) characteristics: sowing season, tillage depth, fertilizer application and herbicide application, and found negative effects of fertilizer on overall weed cover and the proportion of rare species, yet no strong effects of any factor on functional composition. Negative effects of nitrogen fertilizer on the species richness and abundance of rare weeds in crops are well known (Kleijn & vander-Voort 1997; Kov acs-Hosty anszki et al. 2011), and Storkey et al. (2012) found that the proportion of arable weed species in different threat categories among European countries could be explained by average rates of fertilizer and (to a lesser extent) herbicide application. Although fertilization effects may persist longer after harvest than earlier filters, such as tillage and herbicide, the lack of functional responses is probably due to the effective intensification gradient being much shorter (less extreme) in our stubble data set. Moreover, it is possible that our results partly reflect the remedial actions of farmers in response to soil conditions and weed floras, rather than direct vegetation responses. The amount of fertilizer application may therefore be negatively correlated with background field fertility levels, as well as positively correlated with additional variables relating to intensification, such as expenditure on herbicides and farm machinery (Jos e-Mar \u0131a et al. 2010; Armengot et al. 2011 ). Our finding of decreased weed cover in stubble fields with increasing distance from the field edge concurs with other studies (Wilson & Aebischer 1995; Fried et al. 2009b) , which argues that field edges are generally less affected by herbicide and fertilizer application, and that light conditions may also be more favourable than in the inner parts of the fields dominated by the crop.",

Our classifications show little relationship to the 'rare weed trait syndrome' of Storkey et al. (2010) , except in the tendency for rare stubble species to be short, or to the 'decreasing cereal weeds' pattern found by Fried et al. (2012) , except in the association with nitrogen; apparently those patterns rather emerged from our data when actual abundances of weeds in extensive vs intensive fields were considered, and it is notable that we failed to find any convergent effects. The importance of short or later flowering periods corresponds with our classifications based on weed abundances in extensive cereal fields, but the other traits are different. The discrepancies may be due partly to the nature of the sources used for attributing species as 'rare', which represent a national perspective. Thus some non-threatened species of semi-natural habitats are actually very rare as arable weeds, and vice versaraising the question of the relative importance of conserving species vs (arable) communities (Moonen & Barberi 2008) . As for the discrepancies from published rare weed trait syndromes, we argue that trait-divergence assembly patterns potentially constitute better 'syndromes' than trait-convergence patterns. The latter are commonly used in functional trait analysese.g. Kimberley et al. (2013) showed that plant species associated with ancient woodland in the UK were almost exclusively short and usually had large seeds, while Gabrielov a et al. (2013) found a short flowering period to be one of the most important features of critically endangered species in the Czech Republic. Our analyses, in contrast, are able to implicate intermediate values of some traits and interactions between them.",

Special attention should be given to the attribute of short, relatively late-flowering periods, which emerges from both analyses as well as from studies reviewed above (Introduction).",

Our results suggest that the extension of Ujv arosi (1973) to cover a range of germination periods can provide a useful a priori classification for distinguishing rare and common weeds. Over half of the rare species and 90% of the Red List species from cereal fields were late-winter or early-summer annualsindeed, life form seems the most important feature of the classification, since the quantitative traits involved do not show strong differentiation among the three groups (Fig. 5 ). An additional analysis using life forms alone (P = 0.08, C = 0.31; App. S3) also suggested a higher abundance of late-winter and earlysummer annuals in extensively managed fields. These patterns may relate to the susceptibility of such species to the timing of herbicide application in intensive cereal farming, which usually occurs during the peak of their vegetative growth. Late-summer annuals and perennials, by contrast, are able to germinate or resprout after early-season herbicide applications, while many early-winter annuals can germinate during later stages of the season (Ujv arosi 1973; Holzner et al. 1982) . Of course, the timing of our surveys may have affected the abundance of life forms detected with respect to their phenology, so additional work over a wider time-frame or seed bank studies would be useful.",

Functional trait analyses based on trait-divergence patterns, rather than convergence patterns, provided insights into these trends: species associated with extensively managed cereal fields had short flowering durations and either large or small seeds, although we were unable to detect functional trends along gradients defined by specific management factors in stubble fields. We also found that rare Hungarian cereal weed species tend to have low nitrogen requirements and to be late-winter or early-summer annuals, again with shorter flowering periods. All of these attributes should be considered in attempts to secure the conservation of threatened arable floras, both in Hungary and elsewhere.",
