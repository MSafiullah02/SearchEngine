The target countries were chosen using 2 criteria: countries (1) with >10 million population and (2) with >3,000 confirmed cases by April 6, 2020. Overall, 6 Asian countries met these criteria (China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Iran); 8 European countries met these criteria (France, Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, and Turkey); and 2 North American countries met these criteria (United States and Canada). The growth curves for the subsequent 30 days were plotted, starting once the cumulative incidence exceeded 1 case per 100,000 population. India was not included, despite meeting the first 2 criteria because it had not reached the cumulative incidence threshold of 1 case per 100,000 population by April 6, 2020. This analysis revealed that the cumulative incidence of European and North American countries rose exponentially in a similar manner (Fig. 1a), whereas those of Asian countries did not (Fig. 1b).",

The reason for the small number of confirmed cases and total deaths due to SARS-COV-2 in Japan has been a subject of debate. Some have attributed it to the high level of discipline exhibited by Japanese people, such as full-time wearing of face masks and frequent handwashing. However, we propose that the limited number of PCR tests conducted is the main reason for the small number of confirmed cases and that the underdeveloped private practice system and strict government policy have prevented people from undergoing PCR testing in Japan.2 Although the low cumulative incidence per 100,000 population in Japan is striking, the incidence rates of the other Asian countries are also much lower than those of European and North American countries.",

Despite the large size of the susceptible population in China and South Korea, the number of new cases per day has been 100 or less since the middle of March 2020. One hypothesis is that Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination protects against respiratory viruses.3 BCG vaccination is routine in most Asian countries; however, scientific evidence supporting that BCG protects against coronavirus is currently lacking. Habitual physical contact (hugging, kissing, and shaking hands) or hesitation in wearing face masks in public have been proposed as reasons for the faster spread in Europe and North America.",
