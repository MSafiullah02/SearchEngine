Mortalities can reach 100% and have resulted in an 80% decline in the number of hatcheries actively producing M. rosenbergii. To investigate a causative agent for the mortalities, a disease challenge was carried out using infected material from a hatchery experiencing mortalities. Moribund larvae from the challenge were prepared for metatranscriptomic sequencing. De novo virus assembly revealed a 29 kb singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus with similarities in key protein motif sequences to yellow head virus (YHV), an RNA virus that causes mass mortalities in marine shrimp aquaculture, and other viruses in the Nidovirales order. Primers were designed against the novel virus and used to screen cDNA from larvae sampled from hatcheries in the South of Bangladesh from two consecutive years. Larvae from all hatcheries screened from both years were positive by PCR for the novel virus, including larvae from a hatchery that at the point of sampling appeared healthy, but later experienced mortalities. These screens suggest that the virus is widespread in M. rosenbergii hatchery culture in southern Bangladesh, and that early detection of the virus can be achieved by PCR. The hypothesised protein motifs of MrGV suggest that it is likely to be a new species within the Nidovirales order. Biosecurity measures should be taken in order to mitigate global spread through the movement of post-larvae within and between countries, which has previously been linked to other virus outbreaks in crustacean aquaculture.",

Production, particularly in developing parts of Asia, provides direct and indirect employment, a food source to alleviate poverty, and export income in a high value international market (New and Nair, 2012) .

In 2017, Bangladesh was the world's second largest producer of M. rosenbergii, producing 48,574 tonnes (FAO, 2019) . Despite this promising production figure, M. rosenbergii hatcheries have been experiencing mass mortalities of larvae, resulting in the number of hatcheries actively producing larvae declining by almost 80% over the past decade as they are unable to complete the production cycle and it becomes uneconomical to continue. Between 2009 and 2010, over 50 hatcheries were operating in Bangladesh, producing up to two hundred million post-larvae (PL) per year, however in 2019 production had decreased to 27.75 million PL/year from only 12 hatcheries. Hatcheries experiencing mortalities reported that larvae had abnormal shapes, reduced appetite, issues with moulting and a gradual whitening of the body; finally resulting in either disappearance from the culture system, or mortality (SAFETI, Winrock and Worldfish, personal communication; Alam et al., 2019) .",

Ahmed and Troell (2010) reviewed the potential for negative environmental impact associated with fishing for wild PL and identified two main issues; high levels of invertebrate and fish bycatch associated with fishing for larvae (and a subsequent decline in biodiversity) and, a reduction in numbers of larvae returning to the freshwater environment as adults to spawn (reducing natural M. rosenbergii abundance). As fishing for wild post-larvae increases due to the hatcheries being unable to complete production cycles, it is likely that the negative environmental impact caused by fishing will become more pronounced.",

Macrobrachium rosenbergii Nodavirus (MrNV) (Arcier et al., 1999) , in association with extra small virus (XSV) (Qian et al., 2003) , causes white tail disease (WTD), an OIE-listed disease. The viruses have caused devastation in the prawn hatchery industries of Thailand (Yoganandhan, Leartvibhas and Sriwongpuk, 2006) , China (Qian et al., 2003) , India (Hameed, Yoganandhan and Widada, 2004) , Taiwan (Wang et al., 2007) and Indonesia (Murwantoko et al., 2016) . Other viruses causing mortalities include Macrobrachium rosenbergii Taihu Virus (MrTV), a novel dicistrovirus associated with larval mortalities in China (Pan et al., 2016) , Infectious Hypodermal and Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) (Hsieh et al., 2006) , and Decapod Iridescent Virus (DIV1) (Qiu et al., 2019) . Other pathogens have been identified to infect M. rosenbergii without large mortalities including: Macrobrachium Parvo-like Virus (MPV) (Gangnonngiw et al., 2009) and White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) (Sahul Hameed, Charles and Anilkumar, 2000; Sarathi et al., 2008) .",

This technique was recently used to determine that MrNV alone can cause mortalities in M. rosenbergii in the absence of XSV (Gangnonngiw et al., 2020) . Alam et al. (2019) attempted to determine the causative agent(s) associated with the larval mortalities in Bangladesh hatcheries using a screen for Vibrio spp., which are known to cause disease in larval stages of prawn culture (Khuntia et al., 2008) . However, this study was unable to find a strong correlation between the Vibrio species present and the levels of mortalities seen in larvae. Larvae were also screened for the presence of MrNV and XSV, but neither of these were detected. Therefore, no significant pathogens have yet been associated with the large-scale larval mortalities in Bangladesh. The clinical signs of disease observed in these larvae associated with the current large-scale mortalities do not precisely fit those described for infection with any of the known larval prawn pathogens, therefore an approach to detect novel pathogens was needed to determine if there was a pathogenic cause for the mortalities.",

However, it was later discovered that the healthy hatchery experienced mass mortalities to a similar level of other hatcheries in the south of Bangladesh shortly after they were sampled for the experimental material. Larvae in the control treatment group showed a slightly lower mortality rate, with survivors up until day 15 of the challenge (data not shown). As the challenge progressed, reduction in swimming ability, feeding, and growth were observed in all treatments. Moribund larvae appeared white in colour compared to healthy larvae. had BLASTx similarity to YHV. IVA assembly using a pool of all three libraries produced a full genome consensus sequence of 29.11 kb, with an average coverage of 1116x. The two contigs produced by IVA assembly of library three mapped to the 29.11 kb consensus sequence. The full genome sequence is deposited on in supplementary materials. Henceforth, we refer to this novel virus as Macrobrachium rosenbergii Golda Virus (MrGV). Mapping trimmed and quality-filtered reads from each individual library back to the consensus genome gave coverage of 5.37x for library one (pooled challenged larvae from days 1-4), 269.28x for library two (pooled challenged larvae from days 5-10) and 1462.64x coverage for library three (pooled larvae from a hatchery experiencing mortalities). To compare the efficiency of the rnaSPAdes assembly, assembled contigs from individual and pooled libraries were mapped back to the consensus genome. Eleven contigs from library one mapped to MrGV with 0.25x coverage, thirty-two contigs from library two mapped with 2.53x coverage, fifty contigs from library three mapped with 5.04x coverage and 81 contigs from the pooled libraries mapped with 7.25x coverage. rnaSPAdes contigs from libraries two and three gave good coverage over the whole genome but failed to assemble the 5' and 3' ends.

In addition to the three hatcheries that were re-sampled in 2019, a further two hatcheries, none of which had been sampled in 2018, were sampled in 2019 during mass mortality events. These further two hatcheries were also PCR positive for MrGV. Given the number of hatcheries affected by mass mortalities linked to MrGV, its temporal prevalence and spatial spread, with one of the hatcheries over 40 km in distance to the nearest hatchery that was PCR positive for MrGV, we suggest that this novel virus represents a very significant threat to M. rosenbergii aquaculture within Bangladesh, and may be a significant factor in the collapse of larval production in the industry of Bangladesh since 2010.",

Further to this, no sequences were assignable to any other known pathogens of M. rosenbergii in our metatranscriptomic data. Absence of these pathogens and no obvious bacterial cause observed by Alam et al. (2019) strongly suggests that the survival problems in Bangladesh hatcheries are not due to a currently known pathogen and that mass mortalities were linked either to hatchery practice factors or/and the emergence of a novel pathogenic agent. Despite numerous problems identified in hatchery practices (SAFETI, Winrock and Worldfish, personal communication), hatcheries were successfully producing until 2011, and since then, hatchery practices have not changed, suggesting that this is not the main source of mortality events. PCR screens of adult M. rosenbergii from rivers used to collect berried females as the supply of broodstock for the hatcheries were also all negative for MrGV, suggesting that broodstock may not be the entry route of MrGV into the hatcheries. Adults were also negative for all other pathogens as above, except for S. eriocheiris. All larvae sampled from hatcheries experiencing mortalities were negative for S. eriocheiris and no reads for any Spiroplasma species were detected in metatranscriptomic analysis of the moribund larvae, suggesting that S. eriocheiris is also not causing the mortalities in hatcheries.",

A further three domains were found by sequence alignment of MrGV to the protein motifs of nidovirus-specific RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) and Sadenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent N7-and 2'-O-methyltransferases (N-MT and O-MT, respectively). We also identified nucleotide sequences within the overlap of ORF1a and ORF1b suggestive of a -1 ribosomal frameshift.

It is likely that IVA was able to assemble the full genome as it is capable of assembling RNA sequences at highly variable depths (Hunt et al., 2015) , a useful tool in the case of the nidoviruses, which are prone to variability in sequencing depth due to the production of sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs). The presence of sgmRNAs were not assessed in this study but given that rnaSPAdes could not assemble the full genome, it is likely that these sgmRNAs do exist. Future work includes identifying the presence or absence of sgmRNAs and potential transcription regulation sites (TRSs).",

            "text": "The challenge experiment data from this study were unable to determine the route of entry of MrGV into the hatchery system as it was later determined that control animals were sourced from a hatchery assumed to be free of MrGV, but which after sampling larvae for the challenge experienced mass mortalities to a similar level as seen in other hatcheries in southern Bangladesh. Larvae were sampled from the apparently unaffected hatchery and fixed before challenging; these animals were screened by PCR for all pathogens as above and were only positive for MrGV, thus suggesting that animals were infected with MrGV prior to the challenge, explaining the high levels of mortality in 'control' animals. This confounding situation nonetheless further suggests the role and ubiquity of MrGV in mass mortality events across multiple hatcheries in Bangladesh. Future work to identify how the virus is entering the hatcheries is ongoing to suggest preventative methods that could be implemented to ensure biosecurity. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to use a metatransciptomic approach to investigate the mass mortalities experienced in hatchery-reared prawn larvae in Bangladesh. Previous studies have investigated possible agents involved in mortality events using PCR screens and microbial culture, but required the agent to have gene sequences sufficiently similar to known pathogens to amplify with PCR primers or culturable on media respectively, thus limiting the detection of more genetically divergent pathogens, possibly including many viruses. The metatranscriptomic approach used in this study to discover the agent involved in the Bangladesh mortalities was able to identify and characterise a novel pathogen that would likely have not been identified by most commonly employed methods. Furthermore, this method can be used to rapidly detect and comprehensively analyse new and cryptic viral linages, of relevance to both animal and human health.
