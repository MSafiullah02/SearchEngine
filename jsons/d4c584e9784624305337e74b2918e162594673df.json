Daily dosing of chloroquine 250 mg/day produces plasma concentrations at equilibrium of 0.31 to 3.13 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M/L depending on body mass [ 2 , 38 ] . The dependence of time to reach equilibrium levels on daily dosing is schematically represented in Fig. 2. 3 . Because the half-life to reach a steady-state concentration is not the same for all daily doses, one may conclude that the mechanism of drug elimination is not a fi rst-order process, but rather more complicated with some dependence of the eliminationrate constant on plasma-drug concentration (see Chap. 1 ) [ 83 , p. 314, [ 84 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 109, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 588, "end": 594, "text": "[ 70 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 611, "end": 616, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 755, "end": 765, "text": "[ 2 , 38 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1209, "text": "[ 84 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 867, "end": 874, "text": "Fig. 2.", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Distribution and Pharmacokinetics"}, {"text": "The concentration of 4AQs in the tissues of the body after ingestion varies.

The results are similar in rabbits and humans [ 11 , 82 ] . Drug binding to melanin explains the differences between pigmented and albino animals [ 11 ] . The order of concentration of hydroxychloroquine in various tissues of albino rats is similar, except that concentrations in the albinotic uvea fall to the approximate level of the heart. In pigmented mammals, the eye has the highest concentration due to binding by melanin [ 74 ] . Similar results were found after chronic oral administration of chloroquine to albino and pigmented rats (Figs. 2.4 and 2.5 ) [ 74 ] . Limited information from cases of accidental death in persons taking chloroquine and suicides by chloroquine ingestion indicates similar distributions of 4AQs across various tissues in humans [ 11 ] . Tissue uptake as a function of dosage is However, for a given daily dose the fi nal equilibrium concentration will be lower for a higher body mass. Similar relationships apply to hydroxychloroquine dosing. Data from Mackenzie [ 2 ] In some rows only one plateau concentration was measured, with the other deduced (see superscripts ). Findings that whole blood concentrations are approximately fi ve times than that of plasma concentrations are denoted by a . The fi nding that plasma concentrations are approximately one-fi fth of whole blood concentrations is denoted by b nonlinear. In rats, a threefold increase in dosing leads to a 20-fold increase in hydroxychloroquine deposition in liver and spleen [ 85 ] . A useful way to understand the differential distribution of 4AQs across various tissues is to consider ratios of concentration in tissues compared to plasma concentration (Table 2. 3 ). The concentration of chloroquine in the liver, spleen, and adrenal gland is 6,000-80,000 times that in plasma, depending on the species chosen for study-whether the species is pigmented or albinotic-and the regimen of drug administration [ 10 , 32 , 37 ] . Within a single organ there are large differences in drug concentration in particular tissues. For example, chloroquine concentrations in the uvea of the rat are 9-32 times that of the retina, which in turn has concentrations six to nine times that of the vitreous [ 49 , 54 ] . In another example, within skin the 4AQs are more concentrated in the epidermis than the corium with a concentration ratio of 5:1 to 15:1 [ 86 ] . The variation refl ects sequestration of 4AQs by lysosomes and melanin [ 37 ] . Millimolar levels of 4AQs can be found in lysosomes, and melanin can bind a quantity of 4AQs up to 3 % of its weight [ 37 , 87 ] .

Thus the ratio of 4AQs between lysosomes and plasma is approximately 160,000. To maintain osmotic balance as chloroquine enters the lysosome, water accompanies it, swelling the organelle [ 162 ] .

They reason that such concentrations are higher than those expected to be found clinically in the plasma [ 71 , 78 , 142 , 170 ] . For example, although hydroxychloroquine at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 M/L affects IL-17 and other cytokine levels produced by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with RA and SLE in vitro, we are uncertain that this is a physiologic pathway [ 171 ] .

Transcription of DNA to RNA was not blocked [ 182 ] 4. Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 expression occurred by blocking transcription of DNA into mRNA and not by a mechanism involving sequestration of chloroquine in lysosomes as bafi lomycin did not block the effect of chloroquine [ 183 ] 5. In a rat blood-vessel model for assessing prostaglandin inhibition, chloroquine inhibited prostaglandin effects [ 184 ] 6.

These were associated with inhibition of lysosomal enzymes cathepsin B 1 and phospholipase A 2 [ 71 , 140 , 169 , 176 , 185 , 186 ] . Chloroquine also inhibited mucopolysaccharidases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and acid phosphodiesterase within lysosomes [ 166 , 187 , 188 ] . Elevation of pH, as would occur in lysosomes exposed to chloroquine, increased the inhibitory potency [ 185 ] 7. Chloroquine inhibited leukotriene release in human lung tissue cell culture that was overcome by arachidonic acid, suggesting inhibition of phospholipase A2 [ 140 ] 8. Chloroquine inhibited the C p G-oligodeoxynucleotide (C p G-ODN)-mediated blockade of apoptosis and inhibited IL-6 secretion in a murine B cell lymphoma model [ 173 ] 9.
