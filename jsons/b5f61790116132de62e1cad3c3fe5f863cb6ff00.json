There has been a lot of interest in the field of text style transfer due to its wide application to tailored text generation. Existing works evaluate the style transfer models based on content preservation and transfer strength. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based framework that directly rewards the framework on these target metrics yielding a better transfer of the target style. We show the improved performance of our proposed framework based on automatic and human evaluation on three independent tasks: wherein we transfer the style of text from formal to informal, high excitement to low excitement, modern English to Shakespearean English, and vice-versa in all the three cases. Improved performance of the proposed framework over existing state-of-the-art frameworks indicates the viability of the approach.",

On the other hand, more recent works like [19] and [3] perform the task of style transfer without disentangling style and content, as practically this condition cannot always be met. However, all of these works use word-level objective function (eg. cross-entropy) while training which is inconsistent with the desired metrics (content preservation and transfer strength) to be optimized in style transfer tasks. These metrics are generally calculated at a sentence-level and use of word level objective functions is not sufficient. Moreover, discreteness of these metrics makes it even harder to directly optimize the model over these metrics.",

[18] assume a shared latent content distribution across a given corpora and propose a method that leverages refined alignment of latent representations to perform style transfer. [10] define style in terms of attributes (such as, sentiment) localized to parts of the sentence and learn to disentangle style from content in an unsupervised setting. Although these approaches perform well on the transfer task, content preservation is generally observed to be low due to the non-parallel nature of the data.

But the existing approaches do not optimize on these metrics and rather teach the model to generate sentences to match the ground truth. This is partly because of the reliance on a differentiable training objective and discreteness of these metrics makes it challenging to differentiate the objective. Leveraging recent advancements in reinforcement learning approaches, we propose a reinforcement learning based text style transfer framework which directly optimizes the model on the desired evaluation metrics. Though there exists some prior work on reinforcement learning for machine translation [21] , sequence modelling [8] and abstractive summarization [14] dealing model optimization for qualitative metrics like Rouge [11] , they do not consider style aspects which is one of the main requirements of style transfer tasks. More recently, efforts [5, 22] have been made to incorporate RL in style transfer tasks in a non-parallel setup. However, our work is in the field of parallel text style transfer which is not much explored.",

We train a convolutional neural network based style classifier as proposed by [9] on the training dataset. This style classifier predicts the likelihood that an input sentence is in the target style, and the likelihood is taken as a proxy to the reward for style of a sentence and appended to a discriminatorbased loss function extended from [6] . Based on the transfer direction, we add the following term to the cross-entropy loss, L ts = \u2212 log(1 \u2212 s(y )), high to low level \u2212 log(s(y )), low to high level In this formulation, y is the greedily generated output from the decoder and s(y ) is the likelihood score predicted by the classifier for y . When transfer is done from high to low level of style, minimization of L ts will encourage generation of sentences such that the classifier score is as low as possible. When the sentences are transferred from low to high level of style then the formulation ensures that the generated sentences have a score as high as possible.

When all the three loss terms are used simultaneously (TS+CP) the resulting performance lies between TS and CP, indicating that there is a trade-off between the two metrics and improvement in one metric is at the cost of another as observed by [4] . This phenomenon is evident from the results of TS\u2192CP and CP\u2192TS where the network gets a bit biased towards the latter optimization. Moreover, improvement in CP\u2192TS and TS\u2192CP as compared to TS and CP respectively suggests that incremental training better helps in teaching the framework. Since the performance on both transfer strength and content preservation metrics plays an important role in text style transfer task, we chose TS\u2192CP, which has the maximum overall score, over the other models for further analysis.",

Closer look at the outputs (formal to informal transfer task in Table 4 ) reveal that it generates sentences in target style but the sentences do not preserve the meaning of the input and sometimes are out of context (discussed in the Sect. 7). Cross-Aligned performs the worst in informal to formal transfer task among all the other approaches because it is generating a lot of unknowns and is not able to preserve content. TS\u2192CP, on the other hand, has the highest overall score and performs the best in preserving the content. We also observed that the dataset had many sentences containing proper nouns like name of the songs, person or artists. In such cases, copy mechanism helps in retaining the proper nouns whereas other models are not able to do so. This is evident from the higher BLEU scores for our proposed model. Table 3 presents the human evaluation results aggregated over three annotators per sample. It can be seen that in at least 70% of the cases, annotators rated model outputs from TS\u2192CP as better than the three baselines on both the evaluated metrics except for the content preservation as compared to CopyNMT in formal to informal task wherein, both the models perform equally good. One reason behind this is that both the models use copy-mechanism. Table 3 . Human evaluation results of 50 randomly selected model outputs. The values represent the % of times annotators rated model outputs from TS\u2192CP (R) as better than the baseline CopyNMT (C), Transformer (T) and Cross-Aligned (S) over the metrics.

Reviews with rating greater than or equal to 3 were filtered out and considered as exciting to get the non-exciting/boring rewrites. We also asked the annotators to rate the given and transferred sentences on a Likert scale of 1 (No Excitement at all) to 5 (Very high Excitement). The dataset thus curated was split into train (\u223c36K), test (1K) and validation (2K) sets. We evaluate the transfer quality on content preservation and transfer strength metrics as defined in Sect. 4. For measuring the transfer strength we train a classifier as described in Sect. 3.2. We use the annotations provided by the human annotators on these sentences to get the labels for the two styles.

However, CopyNMT performs the best in transferring style in case of non-exciting to exciting transfer task because the model has picked up on expressive words ('awesome', 'great', and 'amazing') which helps in boosting the transfer strength. TS\u2192CP (with highest overall score) consistently outperforms Cross-Aligned in all the metrics and both the directions. Table 3 presents the human evaluation results on this transfer task.

We can observe from the transformer model output for Input 1 and 2 in formal to informal column of Table 4 that it generates sentences with correct target style but does not preserve the content. It either adds random content or deletes the required content ('band' instead of 'better' in 1 and 'hot' instead of 'talented' in 2). As mentioned earlier, in sample output 3 of Table 4 , Cross-Aligned is unable to retain the content and tend to generate unknown tokens. CopyNMT, even though is able to preserve content, tend to generate repeated token like 'please' in sample input 2 (informal to formal task) which results in lower BLEU score than our proposed approach. Transformer model outputs for exciting to non-exciting task in samples 1 and 2 of Table 5 , miss specific content words like 'environment' and 'alisha' respectively. However, it is able to generate the sentences in target style. Similary, Cross-Aligned and CopyNMT are also not able to retain the name of the server in sample 2 of Table 5 . Sample 2 of Shakespearean to Modern English and 1 of Modern to Shakespearean English task in Table 6 provide evidence for high accuracy and lower BLEU scores for transformer model. From sample 2 of Shakespearean to modern English transfer task, we can observe that Cross-Aligned although can generate the sentence in the target style is not able to preserve the entities like 'father' and 'child'. On the other hand, TS\u2192CP can not only generate the sentences in the target style but is also able to retain the entities. There are few cases when CopyNMT is better in preserving the content Your mama is so unintelligent she got hit by a cop and told that she was so as compared to other models, for instance, sample 1 of formal to informal transfer task and sample 3 of non-exciting to exciting transfer task since it leverages copy-mechanism. Another point to notice is the lexical level changes made to reflect the target style. For example, the use of 'would', 'don't' and 'inform' instead of 'want', 'dono' and 'let me know' respectively for transforming informal sentences into formal ones. Use of colloquial words like 'u', 'gonna' and 'mama' for converting the formal sentences to informal can be observed from the sample outputs. Not Table 5 .
