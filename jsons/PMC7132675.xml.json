Parainfluenza was the most common cause of an outbreak followed by influenza A and rhinovirus-enterovirus. Influenza A occurred in residents despite virtually 100% of the pediatric long-term care population being vaccinated. Staff were not required to be vaccinated but were encouraged to do so by the facilities. Our findings were consistent with previous studies of HAIs in pLTCFs because most outbreaks were caused by respiratory infections.2 In addition, the NORA-based outbreak reporting system allows pLTCFs to report outbreaks not only based on testing but also signs and symptoms because testing may not be available or may be cost prohibitive. This allows for better surveillance for outbreaks but decreased specificity about pathogens.",

Additionally, it is possible that illness in staff is underreported, is subclinical illness, or is asymptomatic viral shedding or bacterial carriage. Previous reports on respiratory illness outbreaks in long-term care have shown transmission between staff and residents.7, 8 Although the routes of transmission were not collected in the current study or at the sites, it is feasible that staff transmitted some infections. In a study of the impact of the H1N1 influenza A pandemic on health care workers at an acute care hospital in New York City, 65% of those diagnosed with H1N1 influenza A reported working with influenza-like symptoms prior to presenting to workforce health and safety for evaluation.9 Similarly, Mitchell et al10 reported that among health care workers who had influenza-like symptoms during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 28% continued working.",

Staff may experience increased anxiety as they try to avoid becoming infected and transmitting infections to residents, families, and other staff members. Therefore, it is important for infection control policies to include input from employee health because staff may be at risk of infection or a source of transmission. In addition, the teachers at the on-site schools and the occupational, physical, and rehabilitation staff were often required to adjust their schedules to provide services on residential units because shared facilities, such as classrooms and therapy areas, are closed in response to an outbreak. Outbreaks in pLTCFs also likely have a considerable economic impact caused by increased environmental cleaning, the increased use of personal protective equipment, laboratory testing, medications, blocked beds, unit closures, admissions to acute care hospitals, and staff absenteeism.",

Also, data were collected from the NYSDOH NORA system; therefore, outbreaks that were not reported by the sites or that did not meet reporting requirements were not included. At each site, diagnostic testing algorithms differed; therefore, fewer laboratory-confirmed cases may have been reported. Finally, variability in reporting suspected cases may have occurred because there are no formal case definitions for suspected cases.",

Infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship in pLTCFs can also have positive implications for acute care facilities because children in pLTCFs are frequently hospitalized and can introduce viral respiratory pathogens and multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms into hospital settings.11 Further research in infection prevention interventions should focus on this pLTCF population because this population is growing and a significant part of the health care continuum.",
