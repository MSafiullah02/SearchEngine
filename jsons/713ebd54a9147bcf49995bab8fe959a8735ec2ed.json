The chemical structure of the bases allows an efficient formation of hydrogen bonds only between A and T or G and C; this determines the complementarity principle, also known as Watson-Crick base-pairing of the DNA double helix. The A and T base pair aligns through a double hydrogen bond and the G and C pair glues with a triple hydrogen bond, which is the reason for the higher stability of the G-C Watson-Crick base pair over the A-T Watson-Crick base pair. The overall stability of the DNA molecule increases with the increase of the proportion of the G-C base pairs. The two single DNA strands are complementarily aligned in a reverse direction: the one, called also a leading strand, has a 5' to 3' orientation, whereas the complementary strand, called lagging strand, is in the reverse 3' to 5' orientation ( Fig. 3.1) .",

The planes of the bases are nearly perpendicular to the helix axis and each turn accommodates 10 bases. The wrapping of the two strands around each other leads to a formation of two grooves: the major is 22\u00c5 wide and the minor is 12\u00c5 wide. This structure is known as B-DNA and represents the general form of the DNA within the living cells. Alternatively the DNA double helix can adopt several other conformations (e.g., A-DNA and Z-DNA), which differ from the B-form in their dimensions and geometry. Unlike the A-DNA which is also right-handed, the Z-DNA is left-handed and the major and minor grooves show differences in width. The propensity to adopt one of these alternative conformations depends on the sequence of the polynucleotide chain and the solution conditions (e.g., concentrations of metal ions, polyamines). The hybrid pairing of DNA and RNA strands has under physiological conditions an A-form like conformation, while the Z-form is believed to occur during transcription of the DNA, providing a torsional relief for the DNA double helix.",

The non-covalent forces that stabilize the DNA double helix can be completely disrupted by heating. The collapse of the native structure and the dissociation of the double helix into two single strands is called denaturation (Fig. 3.2) . Under slow decrease in temperature, the correct base pairing can be established again and the DNA renatures. The process of binding of two single strands and the formation of a double strand is known as annealing or hybridization. The annealing conditions need to be established by a slow change of temperature, as a rapid decrease in temperature forces a fast renaturation and results in both intramolecular (within one strand) and intermolecular (within different strands) base-pairing ( Fig. 3.2) . Complementary stretches within one single strand that are in close proximity can re-associate to partial double-stranded intramolecular structures, known as foldback structures.",

Each strand in the DNA serves as a template for the replication machinery, with the DNA polymerase 5 as a major player, replicating them in a complementary manner (Fig. 3.3) . The DNA replication is asymmetric and DNA polymerase elongates in the 5' to 3' direction only. The opposite DNA strand is discontinuously synthesized again in the 5' to 3' direction as small fragments, called Okazaki fragments. The Okazaki fragments are further covalently joined by DNA ligase.

PCR is an iterative process, with each iteration consisting of the following steps: annealing of the short single-stranded DNA molecules, called primers, that complementary pair of the templates' ends; extending of the primers in the 5' to 3' direction by DNA polymerase by successively adding nucleotides to the 3' end of the primer; denaturating of the newly elongated doublestranded DNA molecules to separate their strands; and cooling to allow re-annealing of the short, newly amplified single-stranded DNAs. Each cycle doubles the number of target DNA molecules. Today, PCR is one of the most fundamental laboratory techniques in modern molecular biology. PCR is based on the interaction of DNA polymerase with DNA. Parallel overlap assembly (POA) is a method to generate a pool of DNA molecules (combinatorial library). Short single-stranded DNA molecules, called also oligonucleotides, overlap after annealing and their sticky ends are extended by DNA polymerase in 5' to 3' direction. Repeated denaturation, annealing, and extension cycles increase the length of the strands. Unlike PCR, where the target DNA strands double in every cycle, in POA, the number of DNA strands does not change, only the length increases with the cycle progression ( Fig. 3.7) .",

Thus, a pair (\u03c4, \u03bc) can be drawn so that \u03c4 is chosen according to probability density P 1 (\u03c4 ) and \u03bc is taken according to probability function P 2 (\u03bc).

The RNA is another type of nucleic acid that differs from the DNA in its sugar (ribose instead of deoxyribose), and the thymine (T) base is replaced by uracil (U). RNA is usually singlestranded and can have different functions in the cell, for example, transfer RNA (tRNA, transfers amino acid to the polypeptide chain) or ribosomal RNA (rRNA, one of the components of the ribosomes). The RNA that transfers the information from the DNA to the ribosomes, which represent the protein synthesis machinery of the cell, is called messenger RNA (mRNA). One of the DNA strands, the template strand, directs the synthesis of the mRNA via complementary base-pairing by the addition of nucleotides to the 3' end to the growing mRNA (5' to 3' direction of synthesis). The process is controlled by some functional sequence regions that serve as a set of rules to govern the transcription (Fig. 3.10 ). The transcription is initiated from a promoter located upstream from the DNA coding sequence. Promoter sequences are highly conserved and are recognized by transcription factors, which recruit further the RNA polymerase, the enzyme that is responsible for transcribing the coding part of the DNA into mRNA. Different proteins that participate in the transcription process bind to a specific sequence in the doublestranded DNA and usually make contacts with the bases in the major groove of the DNA helix. During elongation, the RNA polymerase moves along the DNA and elongates the RNA, whereas sequential unwinding of the DNA helix precedes the transcription into RNA. Behind the RNA polymerase, the unwound regions base-pair again and restore the original DNA double helix. The process is terminated by a terminator sequence located downstream from the coding sequence. Transcription is a fast process: 20 to 50 nucleotides per second are added to the growing nascent mRNA chain in vivo at 37 o C.",

In the double-stranded DNA molecules, each base is fixed to its corresponding partner to form a complementary base pair. For the single-stranded RNA (valid also for the single-stranded DNA), each base can bind only one partner at a time, but there are multiple potential partners for such pairing within one chain (Fig. 3.11 The formation of complementary stretches releases free energy (negative value of the Gibbs free energy), which accounts for stabilization, whereas the loops introduce a positive value of free energy (i.e., require energy to be formed). Additional energy is released through the hydrophobic interactions between the base pairs, which are stacked over each other within the double-stranded region. The overall stability of the secondary structure of the single-stranded polynucleotide molecule is determined by the sum of the stabilization through base-pairing and destabilization by the loop structures. The free energy has to reach a sufficient negative value overall, or the secondary structure will be not formed. Intramolecular base-pairing is implicated in the termination of the transcription: a hairpin of palindromic sequences at the 3' terminus causes RNA polymerase to pause and terminate the transcription. A gene is determined by a segment of the DNA comprising the information necessary to be transcribed into functional RNA and further translated into an amino acid sequence with the flanking regulatory and controlling elements that ensure the fidelity of these processes. The information in the mRNA is read from the 5' to 3' direction in groups of three nucleotides and each trinucleotide or triplet is called a codon. The starting point of the translation determines the sequence of the non-overlapping codons, which provides the reading frame. A mutation that changes the triplet frame by insertion or deletion of base pairs will cause a change in the reading frame, known as frameshift. The new reading frame will generate a completely new RNA sequence beyond the site of mutation. Adverse environmental conditions or errors during replication are sources of mutations. Mutations are rare stochastic events and any base pair can be mutated. A change of only a single base pair is called point mutation. The average spontaneous mutation rate corresponds to changes at individual nucleotides of 10 \u22129 to 10 \u221210 per generation. Substitution mutations without any apparent effect on the amino acid level are designated as silent mutations.",

Some mRNAs undergo a self-splicing, but the splicing of the majority of the mRNA is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex composed of small nuclear ribonucleo-proteins. Specific recognition signals are located within the intron (e.g., an invariant GU at the intron's 5' boundary and invariant AG at its 3' boundary define the splice junction). Within the introns, around 20 to 50 residues upstream from the 3' splice site is found a conserved sequence in all the vertebrate mRNAs: CURAY, where R represents purines (A or G) and Y represents pyrimidines (C or U). This sequence represents the branch point. The splicing is initiated by release of the 5' intron end and joining it to the branch point thereby forming a loop structure, a lariat intermediate.

            "text": "The information in the mRNA is processed in a sequential manner in the 5' to 3' direction, where subsequent codons are translated into amino acids. Each set of three nucleotides corresponds to a specific amino acid, and this genetic code is nearly universal for all living organisms. The four nucleotides (A, U, C, and G) at each of the three positions of a codon form 64 possible codons that encode for only 20 standard amino acids and three non-transcribed nonsense or stop-codons (UAG, UAA, UGA). Hence, the genetic code is redundant and highly degenerate, and multiple codons encode the same amino acid. Six codons exist for the amino acids arginine (CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG), leucine (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG), and serine (AGU, AGC, UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG), and the rest of the amino acids are specified by either four, three or two codons. Only two of the amino acids, methionine and tryptophan, are encoded by a single codon (Table 3 .3). The set of codons coding for one amino acid differ mostly in the third position (i.e., the mutation at the third position is phenotypically silent), and the degeneracy of the genetic code might be an evolutionarily acquired tolerance to minimize the deleterious effect of point mutations. The genetic code is widespread but not universal. The genetic code of mitochondria shows some deviations from the \"standard\" genetic code for some amino acids. In certain proteins, substituted amino acids can be integrated via standard stop codons: UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrolysine. The standard genetic code has been expanded to allow incorporation of unnatural amino acids, including amino acids modified with fluorophores for specific detection and chemical and photo-chemical reactive groups for crosslinking. These amino acids are site-specifically incorporated into the peptide chain in response to an amber (UAG) stop codon by an amber suppressor tRNA that is aminoacylated with the desired unnatural amino acid. Another approach of introducing unnatural amino acid relies on the read-through of four-base codons via an aminoacyl-tRNA with an engineered anti-codon loop to accommodate four bases. Translation of the mRNA is carried out by the ribosomes and each codon binds in a complementary manner to the unpaired bases, known as anti-codon of the corresponding tRNA (Fig. 3.14) . Transfer RNA is a small non-coding RNA chain (60 to 95 nucleotides) with a cloverleaf secondary structure. It is the carrier for the amino acid, which after the base pairing of the codon and anti-codon is covalently linked to the carboxyl terminus of the growing where I is a modified base) whose thermodynamic stability is similar to the Watson-Crick base pair. Ribosomes are large nucleoprotein complexes consisting of two subunits that read the genetic code on the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction and translate it into amino acids. Initiation of the translation is a complex process, which requires initiation factors that help the small and large subunits of each ribosome to assemble on the mRNA with the first aminoacyl-tRNA (Fig. 3.14) . This process is slow and rate-limiting for the translation. The translation starts at the AUG codon, which is recognized by the initiator tRNA for methionine. In eukaryotic cells only initiator tRNA can bind to the small subunit of ribosomes before it assembles with the large subunit on the mRNA. In prokaryotic organisms the recognition of the first AUGcodon is controlled by a specific ribosome-binding nucleotide sequence (6 bp) upstream from the start AUG-codon. Therefore, in bacteria the translation can be initiated at any AUG-position in the mRNA given the presence of the upstream ribosome-binding sequence. As a consequence, the mRNA in prokaryotes is often polycystronic (i.e., one mRNA molecule can encode for many proteins). Ribosomes elongate the polypeptide chain by adding one amino acid residue at the time in a three-stage reaction cycle (Fig. 3.14) . The tRNA charged with an amino acid binds to the acceptor site (A site) of the ribosome at the n + 1-th codon. The part of the tRNA that carries the amino acid is in the large subunit, whereas the anti-codon at the other end binds to the mRNA codon. The n-th codon that has been read is in the donor site (P site), which is occupied by the peptidyl-tRNA carrying the nascent amino acid chain. A peptide bond is formed in the second stage through a nucleophilic displacement of the peptidyl-tRNA by the 3'-linked amino acid of the aminoacyl-tRNA. The reaction occurs in ATP-independent manner and the energy is provided by the high energy bond between the polypeptide and the peptidyl-tRNA. The new amino acid from the tRNA is transferred to the C-terminus at the growing chain and the transpeptidation is catalyzed by the peptidyltranferase activity of the large subunit. In the third and final stage, the new peptidyl-tRNA in the A site is transferred, together with the bound codon of mRNA, to the P site. The efficiency of this translocation process is maintained by an elongation factor that binds to the ribosome together with GTP, delivering the energy for the transfer reaction. The elongation of the polypeptide nascent chain is the most rapid step in the protein synthesis. When the ribosomes encounter the stop codon the synthesis is terminated, which results in a release of the polypeptide and dissociation of the two ribosomal subunits from the mRNA. The termination is facilitated by release factors and GTP-hydrolysis. In the whole biosynthetic cycle of the polypeptide chain, GTP acts as an energy donor, ensuring fastness and irreversibility of the coupled initiation, elongation and termination of the translation.",

In turn, the proteins' surfaces are enriched with charged polar residues (e.g., Arg, Lys, His, Asp, Glu) that can establish contacts with the aqueous exterior. In special cases, these residues can be found in the interior of the protein, where they accomplish specific functions (e.g., catalytic functions in the enzymes). Uncharged polar residues (e.g., Ser, Asn, Gln, Tyr) can be found both on the surface and in the interior of the molecule. When found buried in the interior, they are almost always involved in hydrogen bonds. Tertiary structure (i.e., the long-or short-range interactions between the side chain of the amino acids), and the propensity to establish different secondary structures, are assumed to be determined by the primary sequence of the protein. Various secondary interactions between the backbone and different side chains provide the structural basis for the native 3D pattern of a protein sequence: (1) electrostatic interactions, including dipole-dipole and ionic interactions, (2) hydrogen bonds, (3) hydrophobic interactions, and (4) covalent disulfide bonds, formed between some free sulfhydril groups in the side chains of the cysteines in an oxidizing environment.

It is commonly assumed that in the cellular environment, the native conformation is the most thermodynamically stable conformation, populating the global minimum of the energy. En route to the stable native fold, some proteins go through several partially folded intermediate states, which dwell in local energy minima. In the cell, a variety of other proteins (e.g., chaperones, disulfide isomerases, catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds) assist the newly synthesized proteins in attaining their native conformation. For some proteins, the dwelling in a local energy minimum might have a physiological role. A classical example is the hemagglutinin, in which the two chains of the mature protein are kinetically trapped in an intermediate state. A drop in the pH causes conformational changes in the intermediate to an energetically more favorable state, which enables it to penetrate the host cell membrane.

A small fraction of the amino acids of the entire enzyme molecule form the catalytic, active center that comes into contact with the substrate, a molecule that will be converted to one or more products.

The prokaryotic cells are commonly unicellular and a single cell is capable of executing all the physiological activities. Unlike the prokaryotes, in the eukaryotic cell the physiological activities are spatially separated in compartments or organelles surrounded by double-lipid-layer membranes. The various membrane-separated organelles in the cell that accomplish different functions are referred to as the endomembrane system.

It is surrounded by a double membrane, referred to as the nuclear envelope, with pores that allow nucleus components to move in and out. The nuclear membrane extends in various tube-and sheet-like membrane extensions, forming an extensive network of membranes, called the endoplasmic reticulum. In eukaryotes, the mRNA is synthesized (transcription) in the nucleus, whereas the translation into proteins occurs in the cytosol. Ribosomes that perform the protein synthesis are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, the newly synthesized proteins are modified and transported to their final destinations in the Golgi-bodies which bud off from the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus function not only in the processing and transport of proteins designed for secretion and membrane incorporation, but also actively participate in the synthesis of lipids. Different vesicles can be formed by budding off the membranes whose function is to transport nutrients into and waste products out of the cell. In nearly all eukaryotes the aerobic respiratory functions are accomplished in the mitochondria, which are surrounded by a double layer of membranes. Mitochondria are found in almost all eukaryotes and play a critical role in energy metabolism. They produce the energy substance, ATP, by oxidative breakdown of the nutrients. Mitochondria contain their own DNA. There is a variety of other simple compartments surrounded by membranes that are responsible for different functions found in the eukaryotic cell:",

The ribosomes of the host directly translate the RNA strand into the positive-sense viruses, whereas in the negative-sense viruses the RNA is first inverted into positive-sense RNA via RNA polymerase. Examples of RNA viruses are hepatitis A and C, SARS, yellow fever, rubella and influenza viruses; to the DNA viruses belong simian virus (SV) 40, human herpes virus, cowpox smallpox viruses, and bacteriophages.

In the viruses tailored for the viral therapy, either the protein coat is modified so that the affinity only against cancer cells is assured, or the genetic information of the virus is altered and it can enter any cell but replicate only in the cancerous cells.

Belcher and colleagues (2002) have engineered a liquid crystal system from genetically engineered bacteriophage and zinc sulfide, which spontaneously assembles into a thin hybrid nanocrystal ordered into approximately 72 \u03bcm domains. In a subsequent study (2006), they have extended the application of the virustemplated synthesis to assemble nanowires of hybrid gold-cobalt oxide. The virus particles were genetically modified to incorporate gold-binding peptides into the filament coat. The total negative charge of these particles allows them to be layered between oppositely charged polymers to form thin and flexible sheets.

Currently, there are about 49,000 HIV-1 infections in Germany alone, with about 2,900 new infections per year. Primarily, HIV-1 infects and kills immune cells which regulate and amplify immune response. Without effective anti-retroviral therapy, the hallmark decrease in immune cells during AIDS results in a weakened immune system that impairs the ability to fight against infections or cancer, so that death eventually results. HIV-1 is a retrovirus, and similar to all retroviruses its RNA genome replicates by a DNA intermediate. Many retroviruses contain three structural genes (Gag, Pol, and Env, encoding for core and structural proteins, reverse transcriptase, and coat proteins, respectively).

After fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane, the viral core with the associated RNA is internalized into the cell. Partial uncoating of the viral core exposes the viral RNA. In the cytoplasm of the recipient cell, the viral genomic RNA is synthesized by viral reverse transcriptase into a viral double-stranded DNA preintegration complex. After migrating into the nucleus, facilitated by other viral proteins the viral double-stranded DNA of the preintegration complex is integrated randomly into the host DNA by viral integrase. RNA polymerase transcribes the proviral DNA into mRNA. In the early transcription phase, the mRNA is spliced by the cellular splicing machinery into multiply spliced transcripts, producing the Tat, Rev and Nef proteins. When Rev accumulates to a critical level, the mRNA production shifts from multiple spliced to single spliced and unspliced transcripts, resulting in the Env gp160 (containing envelope proteins gp120 and gp41), Vif, Vpr, Vpu proteins and Gag p55 (containing matrix, capsid, nucleocapsid) and Gag-Pol p160 (containing matrix, capsid, protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase) proteins, respectively. The virus is assembled at the plasma membrane, forming a budding virion.

The complementary structures formed are imperfect and the integrity can be interrupted by several non-complementary regions, forming three types of loops: \u2022 Hairpin loops: A single chain flips back through a non-complementary region and forms a double strand with adjacent sequences. \u2022 Internal loops: Short regions within a long double-stranded region are not complementary. \u2022 Bulge loops: One of the strands contains bases which are not complementary to the opposite sequence.",
