Therefore, when compared to standard fractionated radiotherapy, which requires between 10 and 30 hospital visits, SRS stands out as an ideal alternative. When compared to surgery, SRS does not require endotracheal intubation or the use of high-speed instruments, lowering the risk of exposure to infectious aerosols and bone dust present in open procedures. 1,2 Hence, SRS may be considered as a safe treatment option and potentially cost-effective measure during this outbreak. 3 should be subjected to a 14-d quarantine and COVID-19 testing (if available). If testing is unavailable, these patients should be treated as COVID-19 positive with PPE utilization and minimized clinical staffing.",

Procedural bay preparations, 6-foot social distancing measures, PPE handling, patient flow guidance, and patient transportation should follow guidelines as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 4 Each patient is assigned to 1 nurse throughout the procedure. After arrival and confirmed negative screening, patients change into a hospital gown and thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water. All personal belongings are placed in a hospital bag and stored in a locker away from the treatment area. When placing the SRS head frame, appropriate PPE should be worn by involved providers. We define \"appropriate PPE\" as the use of standard-of-care, procedure-specific PPE for patients who are confirmed COVID-19 negative: surgical mask and gloves. \"Enhanced PPE\" for COVID-19 suspected or positive patients is defined as either an N95 respirator plus face shield or powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), surgical cap, disposable gown, and gloves. Nasal cannula with capnography should be avoided due to potential viral particle aerosolization. Peripheral pulse oximetry should be placed in lieu of nasal cannula to assess oxygenation status and the need for supplemental oxygen. Due to the physical separation of radiology and SRS procedural suites, patients travel on stretchers wearing a facemask to obtain radiographic imaging. In the radiology department, patients are again asked to use hand sanitizer before entering/leaving the scanner room. After the completion of radiographic imaging, patients are then returned to the procedure bay. When SRS plans are complete, patients wash their hands again with soap and water located outside of the treatment vault. SRS is then performed per the standard institutional protocol. Once SRS is complete, the headframe is removed, and Bacitracin ointment is placed on pin sites followed by small round bandages. The patient redresses, collects personal belongings, and a copy of discharge instructions is reviewed in detail. Discharge instructions should include COVID-19 specific signs and symptoms as well as contact information should concerns arise. All patients receive a followup telephone call the day after their procedure to assess their well-being.",
