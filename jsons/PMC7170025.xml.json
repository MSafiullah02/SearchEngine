The order includes Roniviridae, Arteriviridae, and Coronaviridae families [1]. The Coronaviridae family is subdivided into Torovirinae and Coronavirinae subfamilies [1]. Coronavirinae is further subclassified into alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-COVs [1]. Phylogenetic clustering accounts for the classification of these subtypes of viruses. Their viral RNA genome ranges from 26 to 32 kilobases in length [2]. They can be isolated from different animal species. These include birds, livestock, and mammals such as camels, bats, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, and cats [2]. The widespread distribution and infectivity of COV make it an important pathogen.",

            "text": "Human pathogenic subtypes of CoV are associated with mild clinical symptoms. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are the two notable exceptions. In 2012, MERS-CoV was first detected in Saudia Arabia. It was responsible for 2,494 confirmed cases, which led to 858 fatalities [2]. In 2002, a subtype of the beta-COV rapidly spread across Guangdong, China. This outbreak resulted in 8,000 infections and 774 fatalities in 37 countries [2]. The outbreak in 2020 has presented in the form of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Deep sequencing studies and lab investigations have identified the culprit as a new strain of COV [3]. Initially, this virus was designated as 2019-nCoV. However, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated it as the SARS-CoV-2 virus [4]. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the disease caused by this novel virus as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The repeated emergence and outbreaks of CoVs indicate a public health threat. This suggests the possibility of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission of newly emerging CoVs. The ongoing changes in ecology and climate make future emergence of such infections more likely [3].",

Outside China, a total of 7,169 cases have emerged in 59 countries. Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, the number of cases and involved countries are expected to vary.

CoVs belong to the Roniviridae, Arteriviridae, and Coronaviridae families [3]. The Coronaviridae family can be classified into four genera of alpha-COV, beta-COV, delta-COV, and gamma-COV [4]. Furthermore, beta-COV can be sub-divided into 5 lineages [5]. Gene characterization has helped identify that bats and rodents are the gene source of alpha-COV and beta-COV [4]. On the other hand, avian species are deemed as genetic sources of delta-COV and gamma-COV [4]. ",

However, clinical cases with diversity in exposure history have emerged. This helps further elaborate that human-to-human transmission of the virus is also possible. Therefore, human-to-human transmission is now considered the main form of transmission. Individuals who remain asymptomatic could also transmit the virus [4]. However, the most common source of infection is symptomatic people. Transmission occurs from the spread of respiratory droplets through coughing or sneezing [4]. Data also suggest that close contact between individuals can also result in transmission [7]. This also indicates possible transmission in closed spaces due to elevated aerosol concentrations [4].",

In critical patients, amylase and D-dimer levels are significantly elevated [4,11]. However, blood lymphocyte counts progressively decreased [4,11]. Common to non-survivors are the elevations in ferritin, neutrophil count, D-dimer, blood urea, and creatinine levels [12]. Elevations in procalcitonin levels are not a feature of COVID-19. Therefore, an elevated level of procalcitonin may suggest an alternative diagnosis such as bacterial pneumonia. Levels of CRP correlate directly with disease severity and progression.",

Critically ill patients require high flow oxygen, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), glucocorticoid therapy, and convalescent plasma [9]. The administration of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended to treat ARDS [4]. Moreover, unnecessary administration of antibiotics should also be avoided. ECMO should be considered in patients with refractory hypoxemia despite undergoing protective ventilation [4]. Patients with respiratory failure may require intubation, mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, or non-invasive ventilation [4]. Treatment of septic shock requires hemodynamic support with the administration of vasopressors. Organ function support is necessary for patients with multiple organ dysfunction [4].",
