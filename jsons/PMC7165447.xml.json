Testing sera from preclinical and clinical studies has also been used to determine the potency of vaccine formulations as well as their potential to induce cross-species or cross-serotype reactive antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been the standard readout method to answer these aforementioned questions. The advent of multiplex testing platforms, such as the electro-chemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA), and bead-based flow cytometric assays enables the simultaneous detection for different antibody specificities and significantly increases the throughput of testing. The nature of multiplex platforms is ideal for sample sparing, enabling more in-depth analyses compared to single-plex assays such as the ELISA. Depending on the serological assay platform, antigens are either simply coated onto assay plates as in the case of the ELISA or they require modifications such as biotinylation or chemical linkage to fluorescent beads. In the case of the ECLIA, antigens require biotinylation to complex with proprietary linkers that allow targeted binding to specific regions in the assay well. The ECLIA technology tested here allows up to ten antigens to be coated in a single assay well.",

Antibody binding to the plate antigens is detected by adding a secondary antibody specific for the immunoglobulin heavy chain of the antibodies in the test sample. For use in the ECLIA, the polyclonal secondary antibody is coupled with a proprietary Sulfo-Tag as the reporter molecule. Lastly, the substrate for the Sulfo-Tag is added. Upon inserting the specialized ECLIA plates into the reader, an electric pulse initiates the substrate conversion, resulting in chemiluminescence. A high-resolution camera quantifies the ECLIA signal in the various sectors of the well and reports the luminescence signal in each well sector. One of the significant advantages of ECLIA is that the substrate is activated by the reader thus eliminating any variability as result of timing associated with the addition of the substrate to the wells and the plates, which can be an issue in the ELISA.",

The plate antigens were either the full-length CSP [4], or peptides representing the central CSP-repeat region or C-terminal end of the CSP. Plate antigens with significant epitope-overlap were chosen deliberately to address potential antigenic competition when simultaneously testing sera for reactivity with different epitopes. The performance of the new ECLIA-based readout was compared to that of a qualified, malaria-specific ELISA performed in an international serology reference center, since the ELISA is a commonly employed serological readout in malaria (due to the relatively basic requirement for hardware), and historical comparison to earlier results within our program spanning close to 20 years [5, 6]. The ELISA requires testing of several replicates of a serially-diluted sample to either determine the OD1 titre or endpoint titre. In the case of a quantitative ELISA, several sample dilutions need to be tested to ensure that the OD of the sample falls within the linear range of the standard curve.",

To characterize the ECLIA platform and compare it to the classical ELISA, pre-existing CSP-immune nonhuman primate (NHP) samples (n = 30) [9] and a de-identified human CSP-immune serum pool were used. Commercial human pooled serum (Gemini Biosciences, Sacramento, CA) was used as negative (malaria-na\u00efve) control serum. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies, one specific for the C-terminus of the CSP (clone 1E9, PATH/MVI), and one specific for the CSP-repeat region of the CSP (clone 1A6, PATH/MVI), were used as assay controls. The PfCSP-FL was biotinylated using the Lightning-Link Rapid Biotin Conjugation Kit (Expedeon, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Biotinylated proteins were diluted to desired concentrations using coating diluent (0.5% BSA, 1xPBS). All calculations were done based on molarity. 200 \u00b5l of each biotinylated protein (300 nM) was combined with 300 \u00b5l of a unique U-plex linker provided by the U-PLEX platform (MSD), vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Post incubation, 200 \u00b5l of Stop Solution (MSD) was added to the biotinylated proteins and linker mix, vortexed, and incubated at RT for 30 min, resulting in a 10 \u00d7 coating concentration. All U-PLEX-coupled protein solutions for the multiplexing were combined into one tube (600 \u00b5l each of the eight, U-PLEX-coupled protein solution). The U-PLEX-coupled protein solutions were brought up to 6 ml with Stop Solution, creating a 1\u00d7 multiplex coating solution. Fifty \u00b5l of the 1\u00d7 multiplex coating solution was added to each well of the U-PLEX 10-assay plates. Plates were sealed with sealing tape (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and incubated at RT for 1 h on a Titramax plate shaker (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany), shaking at 700 rpm.

To demonstrate the impact of biotinylation on the reactivity of antibodies to the antigens, competition assays were set up to demonstrate specificity and epitope accessibility of the biotinylated, sector-specific and linker-coupled antigens (Fig. 2). ECLIA plates were coated with the biotinylated/-sector-specific linker-coupled Pf16 peptide using U-PLEX Linker 1. Malaria na\u00efve pooled human serum (specificity control) and the CSP-immune serum pool were tested at a 1:3,000 dilution. Unlinked, non-biotinylated Pf16 peptide was used as competitor at 8 different concentrations (two-fold dilutions starting at 300 nM, which is the concentration of the linked plate antigen). Competing equal concentrations of plate-bound vs. soluble Pf16 peptide results in a roughly 70% competition. This could be due to different orientations and valencies when providing the peptide in a monomeric form vs. a format that may resemble multimers (due to the closer spatial arrangement of the peptide on the ECLIA well spot). In conclusion, biotinylation of the tested antigens does not alter the reactivity with CSP-immune antibodies.",

The multiplexed ECLIA experiment tested the full length antigen (CSP-FL), its central repeat region (NANP), its C-terminal fragment protein (C-term) and the smaller C-terminal peptide Pf16. The optimal coating concentrations (66 nM for CSP-FL, 300 nM for the fragments/protein subunits) were applied to coating either wells with one antigen only (singleplex) or a cocktail consisting of all peptides (multiplex). CSP-immune serum and malaria-na\u00efve human pooled serum (negative control) were used at 1:5000 dilution to determine whether multiplexing resulted in lower luminescence signal, which would indicate antigenic competition (Fig. 4a). To demonstrate specificity of the response, mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), specific for the C-terminus or the CSP-repeat region, were tested against all plate antigens (Fig. 4b, c). Titrations of these mouse mAbs were performed to demonstrate that no antigenic competition occurs at any antibody concentration and to further establish specificity of the responses in the single- vs. multiplexed format. The C-terminus specific mAb 1E9 did not react with the CSP-repeat peptide (Fig. 4b) and the CSP-repeat -specific mAb 1A6 did not react with the C-terminal fragments of CSP (Fig. 4c). It is noteworthy that the titrations of the mAbs showed a different dose response curve; mAb 1E9 yielded a typical response curve with a linear portion and a saturation point for both the CSP-FL and the C-terminal fragments. In contrast, the titration of the CSP-repeat-specific mAb 1A6 did not reach saturation despite a wide range of concentrations. Both mAbs responded stronger with their respective fragment than with the CSP-FL. In summary, no antigenic competition was detected when using either CSP-immune human serum or mouse monoclonal antibodies as evidenced by comparable signal strength in the singleplex and the multiplex assay format.",

Using CSP-immune human serum, there was a clear hierarchy in the reactivity to the different plate antigens: the highest reactivity was against the CSP-FL followed by the C-terminal fragment, the C-terminal protein (Pf16), and the CSP-repeat peptide. This may reflect the number of epitopes that are available for antibody binding or may indicate the need for some conformation. Overall, the minor variability (\u2264 5.4% CV for CSP-FL, \u2264 4.8% CV for CSP-repeat, and \u2264 3.7% CV for both C-terminus antigens) in the results indicate that this assay was highly reproducible and significantly lower than the variability of the ELISA.",

Comparing some of the features with the classic ELISA demonstrated the advantages of the ECLIA based assay for assays that establish the antigenic profile of humoral immune responses in either vaccinated individuals or residents of malaria-endemic areas (summarized in Table 1). Special emphasis was placed on determining whether closely related antigens could be tested simultaneously without impacting the quantification of such antibodies. To this end, a single malarial antigen, CSP, and its fragments were used as plate antigens. CSP is one of the leading malaria vaccine antigens [12]; the magnitude of antibody responses to either full length CSP [13] or its fragments has been identified as a potential biomarker of protection [14, 15]. While the role of CSP-repeat-specific antibodies has been well documented [8, 13, 15, 16], there are conflicting data on the role of C-terminus-specific antibodies [7, 14, 17] and their ability to contribute to protection against infection. The method described here enables high-throughput testing and permits profiling of large samples sets even when sample volumes are limited to determine the role of epitope specificity of CSP-specific antibodies.",

            "text": "The assay development report evaluates crucial parameters for a sensitive and reproducible assay: (1) the optimal coating concentrations for the CSP protein, as well as the derived peptides that represent important functional elements in efficacious immune responses induced by vaccination; (2) the equivalency of the U-plex linkers to ensure that no bias is introduced by assigning test antigens to linkers that are not capable of delivering the same signal strength; (3) the impact of biotinylation on immunoreactivity with specific antibodies. In this study, biotinylation did not notably change the interaction between antibodies and the antigens. However, it should not be assumed that this will be the case for all antigens. One cannot exclude the possibility that biotinylation may impact access to select epitopes by a subset of antibodies due to steric hindrance. The assay described here is intended for the characterization of polyclonal responses where steric hindrance would only have a negligible impact on the overall signal considering the wide range of epitope specificities and the high sensitivity of the assay platform. Other multiplex platforms such as bead-based flow cytometry also requires modification of the antigens by either biotinylation or chemical linkage. The latter assay platform has been used in some field studies for the profiling of antibody specificities and their contribution to clinical outcomes [18, 19]. Alternatively, protein arrays are available that allow an in-depth profiling of the antibody responses in vaccinees or residents of malaria endemic areas with special emphasis on polymorphic antigens where several alleles have been included into the array chips [20]. The ECLIA method described here could be considered complementary to protein microarrays. While microarrays typically contain hundreds of antigens printed onto chips and can be costly, they are instrumental in profiling serological responses and are invaluable in identifying biomarkers of protection [21]. Once specific markers of protection or disease have been identified, they could be applied to the ECLIA assay platform, thus streamlining the testing process and reducing the overall cost of assay performance and analysis.",

However, because of the extremely wide linear range of the ECLIA, a simple single-point measurement is sufficient to determine antibody titres. By contrast, in the ELISA, a much narrower linear range means that multiple dilution points are necessary for each sample to be in the linear range of the instrument, and then serial dilutions are required to create a titration curve from which a titre can be calculated. Furthermore, the ECLIA can be multiplexed to measure responses to multiple antigens simultaneously from a single sample. Equally important, no antigenic competition could be detected when testing closely related antigens in the ECLIA. These characteristics make the ECLIA the preferred platform for serological immunoprofiling, which is crucial for the identification of biomarkers of exposure or correlates of immunity.",
