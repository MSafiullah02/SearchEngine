            "text": "The main advantages of using mice in research include (1) their small size and very prolific nature, (2) the numerous commonalities existing between mice and humans in terms of physiology and pathobiology, (3) the well-characterized genomes and immune responses, and (4) the availability of advanced technologies for genetic and other experimental manipulations.1,2 Despite the advantages, there is ongoing controversy surrounding the reproducibility and translatability of mouse models of disease.3\u20135 Given the immune diversity within the human population, a perfect model relevant to all humans may be neither an achievable nor a reasonable expectation. However, it is possible to strive for relevant and reproducible translational models and to expect experimental designs to address specific research questions. Criticisms of mouse models (mouse blaming) are not always justified. Many factors contribute to study outcomes and reproducibility. These include genetic diversity; microbial, husbandry, and other environmental factors; experimental interventions; etc.2 Increasing the awareness of the immunobiological variations among inbred mice and their substrains as well as other factors that may impact immune responses in mice will help improve both the validity and reproducibility of mouse-based research. Attention to these aspects is warranted in experimental design, data interpretations, and reporting of research on immunity, disease, and therapeutic interventions.6,7",

The first committees on standardized genetics nomenclature11 and on standardized strain nomenclature for mice12 included Nobel laureate George Snell. Early publications provided guidelines for gene and strain nomenclature, a list (database) of strains and substrains, and a list (database) of abbreviations for the researchers or institutions maintaining the mice.12 The list of abbreviations became the \u201claboratory codes\u201d (lab codes) that are currently curated by ILAR (http://dels.nas.edu/global/ilar/lab-codes) and are available to producers and researchers at no charge. The lab code identifies the mouse source and becomes part of its name. The 1963 revision includes a listing of named genes, including histocompatibility alleles for many of the common strains. Subsequent committees updated the guidelines and included lists of inbred strains, substrains, and known genetic variants.13\u201319 These publications are enlightening regarding the history and research use of contemporary mouse strains. They indicate recognition by the scientific community of the research implications of genetic and phenotypic variations, and reflect scientists\u2019 concerns for accurate communication in published research. In 1972, a recommendation was published for standardized nomenclature for outbred stocks of laboratory animals of various species.20 These recommendations gained traction for mice and rats, but far less for other species. Current gene nomenclature \u201crules\u201d for mice (International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice: http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/strains.shtml), rats (Rat Gene Nomenclature Committee: https://rgd.mcw.edu/nomen/nomen.shtml), and human genes (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee: http://www.genenames.org/) are available online. Guidance for mouse strains, genes, alleles/mutations as well as tutorials and assistance can be accessed from Mouse Genome Informatics Nomenclature sites (http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml). Recommendations for reporting animal research include correct nomenclature because it communicates key research-relevant elements of the strain or substrain history and genetics, genetic modifications, backcrossing or intercrossing, and other information.21\u201323",

As illustrated in Table 2, some immune relevant genetic variations among C57BL/6 substrains include a Nlrp12 mutation in C57BL/6J mice and a Dock2 mutation in C57BL/6NHsd mice from certain colonies.55,77 The Nlrp12 gene primarily controls neutrophil chemotaxis in response to bacterial invasion. C57BL/6J mice carry a missense, loss of function mutation (Nlrp12C57BL/6J) and are more susceptible to certain bacterial infections compared with other C57BL/6 substrains harboring the wild-type Nlrp12 allele.55,73 More concerning may be when mutations arise within a substrain (of the same name) with colonies maintained at different sites. The Dock2Hsd mutation was revealed when reduced splenic marginal zone B cells and increased numbers of CD8+ T cells were identified in C57BL/6NHsd (and derived mutant mice) relative to other C57BL/6N mice.77\u201379 Subsequently, Envigo tested their mice and reported that this mutation (Dock2Hsd) was present in 6 of their 19 C57BL/6NHsd colonies (http://www.envigo.com/assets/docs/c57-customer-communication-2-final-9jun16.pdf). Many research programs maintain in-house colonies of genetically engineered animals and \u201cwild-type\u201d background strains that warrant genetic quality assurance (QA) testing and breeding strategies to minimize effects of random mutations and genetic drift.

Leakiness refers to the tendency of scid mice to produce some functional B and T cells as they age and are increasingly exposed to environmental antigenic stimuli. Under similar experimental conditions, leakiness is greater on the C57BL/6 and BALB/c backgrounds, low on the C3H/HeJ background, and very low on the nonobese diabetic (NOD) background.93 Genetic factors contributing to \u201cless sensitivity\u201d to antigenic stimuli (and therefore less leakiness) include TRL4 deficiency in the C3H/HeJ mouse and impaired MHC-dependent antigen presentation in the NOD/ShiLtJ mouse.94,95 Especially relevant to human xenografts, NOD mice possess a unique signal-regulatory protein alpha (Sirpa) polymorphism with higher affinity for the human CD47 that results in a sustained \u201cdon\u2019t-eat-me\u201d signal and improves engraftment of human cells in NOD-scid and NOD-scid-derived mice.58",

A spontaneous mutation in the Faslpr gene in this strain resulted in the substrain MRL/MpJ-Faslpr, which develops signs of autoimmunity much earlier in life than the parent MRL/MpJ strain.115\u2013118 MRL/MpJ-Faslpr mice have a short lifespan (>50% mortality by 6 months old). They develop lymphoproliferative disease, immune complex glomerulonephritis, lupus-like skin disease, arthritis, and vasculitis.115,120\u2013123 It has been demonstrated that onset and severity of symptoms associated with the Faslpr mutation is strain dependent. For example, the Faslpr mutation results in a lymphoproliferative disease that on MRL/MpJ background is more severe than on the C57BL/6J background, but less severe than on the C3H/HeJ background.28,29,31,124 In contrast, immune complex pathologies including glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and arthritis are more severe and initiate earlier with the Faslpr mutation on the MRL/MpJ background than on either the C57BL/6J or the C3H/HeJ background. Predisposition to the development of autoimmune and/or lymphoproliferative lesions in these strains has been mapped to a number of possible other genetic variations.28\u201336 Interestingly, when compared with C57BL/6J and/or C3H/HeJ mice, the MRL/MpJ strain harbors diverse polymorphic alleles, unique QTL, or specific haplotypes that render this background more susceptible to autoimmune manifestations.28\u201332 As an example, low to no expression of CFHR-C in MRL/MpJ may contribute to the immune hyperresponsiveness typical of this strain.109",

Additional molecular investigations, including sequencing, are applied to define the mutation further.88,143 An advantage of forward genetics is the relatively unbiased approach that requires no assumptions or hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of the trait or phenotype. An historical and illustrative example in immunology is the characterization of TLR4, first recognized as the main sensor for lipopolysaccharides (LPS) thanks to studies conducted on the spontaneously TLR4 deficient C3H/HeJ mice, and closely related TLR4 sufficient substrains.95 A null mutation Tlr4lps-del mapping to the same site was identified later in the C57BL/10ScCr substrain of the C57BL/10 mouse and is now available as C57BL/10ScNJ.144,68 Similarly, the role of Foxp3 as an essential transcription factor for the development of regulatory T cell (Tregs) was first revealed via the analysis of mice with the spontaneous scurfy mutation (Foxp3sf).145",

The peculiar vulnerability of the hematolymphoid tissue to ionizing radiation results in extensive lymphoid depletion and sustained myeloablation. For this reason, ionizing radiation remains an important immunosuppressive intervention allowing the engraftment of xenotransplants/allotransplants, including, for example, tumors or human haematopoietic stem cells for the generation of mice with humanized immune system.175,176 Sensitivity to irradiation has been linked to the capacity to repair radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Immunodeficient mice harboring the Prkdcscid alleles are particularly radiosensitive due to the scid mutation that affects repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks.177,178 Susceptibility to irradiation varies among mice, with strains such as the C57BL/6, A/J, and C3H/HeMs being highly resistant and other strains such as BALB/c being highly sensitive.177,179 A hypomorphic Prkdc allele (Prkdcdxnph), identified in BALB/c strains, seems to have an important role in BALB/c susceptibility to ionizing radiation.178,180,181 Some detail on irradiation tolerance, variations, and dosage protocols is available from the sources of mice that are commonly irradiated (https://www.taconic.com/taconic-insights/oncology-immuno-oncology/rodent-irradiation-considerations.html; https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/find-and-order-jax-mice/most-popular-jax-mice-strains/immunodeficient-mouse-and-xenograft-host-comparisons).

Cyclophosphamide (CYP), a cytotoxic alkylating agent used in the treatment of neoplastic and autoimmune diseases, is also exploited to induce neutropenia in the context of infectious disease studies.199 Mice with impaired granulocyte production and/or leukocyte function secondary to CYP are more prone to develop systemic disease upon experimental infection with environmental opportunists such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Cryptococcus neoformans.200,201 CYP has both immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects.202 Immunosuppression in mice appears to result from the induction of apoptosis in activated B and T cells as well as NK cells.203 At low doses, CYP may enhance immune responses to tumor antigens attributed, at least in part, to suppression of Tregs.204 Similarly, the alkylating agent busulfan is used as conditioning regimen to enhance engraftment of xenotrasplanted hematopoietic stem cells.205,206 Other important agents include 5-fluorouracil (5FU), which selectively depletes tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promoting the activation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells.207,208 Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine A, directly inhibit Tregs function, by inhibiting pheripheral Tregs generation, and less directly by limiting IL2 production, in preventing transplant rejection and to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions.209\u2013215 Glucocorticoids are important clinically and experimentally for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.216",

Neonatal thymectomy experiments offered early evidence of the existence of Tregs as these mice develop autoimmune disease shortly after the removal of thymus.231 Thymectomy is also used to investigate the dynamics of extrathymic T cell development.232 However, mice exhibit a relatively high frequency of functional thymic tissue in ectopic locations, especially in close proximity to the thyroid gland (also known as cervical thymus). While ectopic thymi may be small, they can be confounding source of T cells. They are reported to be more common in NOD and BALB/c mice compared to C57BL/6 mice.232,233",

Five of the 8 founder strains are \u201cclassical\u201d laboratory strains including 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, and NZO/HlLtJ. Three founder strains are \u201cwild-derived\u201d: CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. Currently available CC RI lines are distributed through consortia (e.g., http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py) and public repositories (e.g., https://www.jax.org/strain/027296). Since their inception, partially inbred CC mice have been characterized and compared for the identification of deviant immune traits or phenotypes. They have provided opportunities to study the evolution of complex genetic interactions.573 The application of immunogenomics and immunonogenetics techniques on CC mice has identified QTLs, polymorphic regions, and candidate genes that control mouse immunodiversity572 and have contributed to our understanding of susceptibilities to SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and Aspergillus fumigatus.574\u2013577 DO mice (https://www.jax.org/strain/009376) were developed by random outcross matings of 160 CC RI lines, and the breeding strategy of continued random matings is designed to maximize their genetic diversity.578\u2013581 The genetic heterogeneity of DO mice far exceeds that of genetically undefined mice, termed \u201coutbred,\u201d that derive from the Swiss branch of the mouse family tree (e.g., CD-1, CFW, ICR, ND4, NMRI, SW) originating from Clara Lynch\u2019s original 9 albino mice brought to the United States from Switzerland in 1926. The genetic heterogeneity and heterozygosity among these mice is more limited and varies with their source.582,583 While the literature is still fairly limited on CC RI strains and the derived DO mice, these represent translational research tools that take advantage of mouse genetic variability to identify disease mechanisms, select novel drug targets, and discover associated biomarkers.",

Recognition of intrinsic and extrinsic contributors to immune phenotypes is crucial for the selection of more relevant and reproducible mouse models and generation of robust translational data. Known contributors can be intentionally used or intentionally avoided in the experimental system. Accurate reporting of animals and study conditions is mission critical to communicating biomedical research. Well-designed and reported research in mice has much to offer to our understanding of immunity and important diseases of humans and other species.",
