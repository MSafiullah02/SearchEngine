            "text": "Based on past history, it is not just a hypothetical risk that many people have been infected with unrecognized viruses. By the time a new virus, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus, is found, it is too late to save the lives of many individuals even thousands. For longer-term solutions, a powerful molecular technique is needed to rapidly identify any previously unrecognized viral agent without using virus isolation. Such a method could then be applied for investigation of future outbreaks. The most recent technologies for detecting and identifying previously unrecognized pathogens are differential display, representational difference analysis, subtractive hybridization, expression library screening, broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serial analysis of gene expression. But they are all time-consuming and not very reproducible approaches (Allander et al., 2001).",

Subtractive hybridization, a differential display-like technology, has been an approach used to identify and isolate cDNAs of differentially expressed genes in the field of cancer research (Yen, 2000; Su et al., 1997). These methodologies all have in common that one DNA population (driver) is hybridized in excess against a second population (tester) DNA to remove sequences present in both populations. In this project, we adapted the method for mRNA analysis to rapidly detect genes from an unknown virus. For this purpose, a subtraction hybridization-like method with a single-strand deletion technology was developed, and HCV was used as a hypothetical unrecognized virus in this study.",

More specifically it is single driver strands and linear amplified tester strands that are degraded. The double stranded products of the exponential amplification of the unique tester sequence remain unaffected. After reducing the background of the 1st PCR products, a nested PCR was performed by using the nested primers to further enrich the differentially produced sequences, which are from the tester but not from the driver.",

Basically, subtraction hybridization is a subtractive DNA enrichment technique. These methodologies all have in common that one DNA population (the driver) is hybridized in excess against a second population (the tester) to remove sequences present in both populations, thereby enriching target sequences unique to the tester. In theory, under standard conditions, subtraction hybridization has second order kinetics of hybridization (C/C\n0\n = 1/1 + \nKC\n0\nt) (where K is the second-order hybridization rate constant, C is the surface concentration of cDNA, and C\n0 is the initial concentration of cDNA in solution) (Miner et al., 1995, Towery et al., 2001, Wang and Drlica, 2003). During the hybridization reaction, re-annealing is faster for the more abundant molecules. Concentrations of high (driver cDNA) and low (tester cDNA) become roughly equal, and based on this theory, tester cDNA is significantly enriched.",

To prepare full-length cDNA libraries for rapid discovery of a new virus still remains a challenge in the field. In this study, we used successfully the template-switching activity of MMLV reverse transcriptase with a modified oligo (dT) primer to synthesize a full-length first-strand cDNA as starting material.
