Reported patients worked or lived near the local Huanan seafood wholesales market. Associated symptoms are acute respiratory infection and, in some patients, rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS), severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), acute respiratory failure, and other serious complication. Mild symptoms are seen in most patients with good prognosis. A lot of casualties are reported of those patients having symptoms of severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multiple organ failure. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified novel coronavirus on January 7, from throat swab sample of a patient. World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus as 2019-nCoV. Currently, epidemiological and clinical attributes of 2019-nCoV are freighting causing alarming situation globally [1].",

In humans, there are six previously reported human coronaviruses that can be transmitted between humans, which are responsible for causing mild upper respiratory disorders. SARS having 10% fatality rate and MERS with 35% fatality rate are also beta-categorized coronavirus and are highly pathogenic in humans. Both viruses are of zoonotic origin [2\u20134]. SARS outbreak took place in 2003, transmitted through mammals into humans especially through bats [5]. Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains Protease Mpro encoded by RNA of the virus, initially reported in 2019 in the city of China, Wuhan. From Wuhan, seafood market pneumonia virus\u2019 genome sequence was determined (NCBI genome ID MN908947, GenBank MN908947.3) published by Wu Et al.

This type of drug development would provide the first line of defense against future emerging CoV-associated ailments like SARS. Development of wide-spectrum drugs requires possible conserved target sequence within whole genus coronavirus. For identifying the possible potent target, extensive research was done and Mpro (molecular weight 34 kDa) was identified as targeted protease, overall controlling RNA replication and transcription. Mpro is the main CoV protease, sharing highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparing four crystal structures. Homology model also represents all three genetic clusters of genus coronavirus. CoV genome sequence mutates with high frequency [8]. For all known RNA viruses, coronaviruses have the largest genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb in length. Apart from encoding structural proteins, the major portion of the viral genome is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide that ultimately encodes for those essential proteins involving in viral reapplication and genome expression. The ~ 306 aa length protease is also encoded by polypeptide, and this polypeptide is processed finally into a functional protein. Picornavirus and Mpro shares similar cleavage-site specificity, so this Mpro is also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Extensive research showed that Mpro from different coronaviruses is highly conserved in terms of 3D structure and structure, which is why Mpro is a potential target for designing anti-coronaviral drug [9].",

All the compounds exhibited great binding properties with Mpro. A total of 60 compounds were selected after applying cut-off value of \u2265 \u2212 6.5 kcal/mol. These compounds reported in this study exhibit great potential as future drugs against Mpro of 2019-nCoV. The compound named, Robustone, is a flavonoid compound which has been previously reported as an antioxidant [28], inhibitor against the protease of dengue virus [29], exhibited great binding affinity properties against Mpro of 2019-nCoV. Lycopene has been known to be an effective antioxidant [30] as well as an anti-proliferative compound against several cancers [31]. Isopomiferin which is a derivative of plant-based compound pomiferin has been known to exhibit anti-microbial properties, anti-inflammatory agent, effective agent against diabetes and a potent antioxidant (Table 1) [32, 33].",

As the gap energy increases, it leads to compound with decrease reactivity and vice versa [34]. Herein, Robustone, SchizolaenoneB, Osajin, IsosilybinA, SilybinA, Silydianin, and Isopomiferin showed the highest reactivity by depicting minimal band energy gaps.
