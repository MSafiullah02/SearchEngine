Briefly, a-glucosidase was inhibited to a greater extent when the compound contained a fused-aromatic ring (e.g. 17 and 25) and a heteroaromatic component (e.g. [19] [20] [21] . It is worth noting that the enzyme was more interactive with a bicyclic than a tri-or mono-cyclic aglycon (e.g. 16 vs. 25 vs. 10). The aglucosidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was also investigated with the same library. The results were similar to those with bakers' yeast.

[34] Previously, we reported the antivirus effects of an N-nnonyl DNJ (NN-DNJ) on flavivirus infections. [16] However, fivemembered iminocyclitols had not been tested for their antiviral activities. With the potent a-glucosidase inhibitors in hand, we tested their potential antiviral effect based on our previous assay system for JEV and DEN-2. Details of the antivirus assay are given in the Experimental Section. Compounds 7, 17, 20, 22 , and 24 exhibited no inhibition at 50 or 100 mM (data not shown). The peracetylated compound 30, which is believed to increase the cellular uptake and is then converted to compound 24 by cellular esterases, [35] was subjected to the cell assay. However, it also showed no inhibition at 50 mM (data not shown). We then turned our attention to modifying the ring nitrogen on the most potent a-glucosidase inhibitor 24. Side-chain modification by alkylation of DNJ has previously been reported to enhance both the ability to inhibit glycan processing and virus production. [13, [36] [37] [38] To study the influence of the alkyl-chain length on the cellbased assay, a series of compounds with alkyl chains ranging from C 4 to C 12 attached to compound 24 was synthesized by using reductive amination with appropriate aldehydes to give rise to compounds 31-38 (Scheme 3). The inhibition activities of N-alkylated derivatives against aand b-glucosidase were also investigated (see Supporting Information). The results showed that these molecules still have a-glucosidase selectivity, albeit with low activity compared to the parent compound 24. This result was also observed in the in vitro anti-a-glucosi-dase activity of DNJ and NN-DNJ. The cell-based sodium 3,3'-{1,[(phennylamino)carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) assay, which measured cell proliferation, indicated that most of the compounds were not toxic at 10 mM (Figure 2 A) . The exception was compound 38, which showed a low level of cytotoxicity. In general, the alkylated iminocylitols were more active against DEN-2 than JEV infection (Figure 2 B ). Relative to the virus titer derived from cells treated with NN-DNJ, these newly synthesized molecules were less potent against DEN-2 infection (Figure 2 C). However, in anti-JEV infection, compounds 36-38 were more potent than NN-DNJ. Compound 37 ( Figure 3 ) appeared to be less cytotoxic and more potent with IC 50 = 4.7 mM and IC 90 = 9.2 mM for DEN-2 ( Table 2 ). In the present studies, compounds 36-38 with chain lengths of nine, ten, and twelve carbons, respectively, were found to be optimal for the antiviral activity. A similar effect was also noticed against varicella zoster virus. [39] Longer alkyl chains, such as, the decyl chain in compound 38, provided a modest increase in potency in cell-based assays, but also resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity, presumably due to the disruption of the lipid bilayer. [36] From a structural perspective, the alkylated iminocyclitol can be viewed as consisting of two distinct molecular elements: 1) an imino sugar head group and 2) an N-alkyl side chain. The head group is recognized by the ER-a-glucosidase. The role of the tail, as shown for NN-DNJ, is unclear but it might be able to insert into the membrane to increase its local concentration near the membrane-associated ER glucosidase. [40] In recent studies, N-nonyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NN-DGJ), a galactosetype iminocyclitol, was found to still have anti-HBV [12] and anti-BVDV [13] activities, although it lacks the ability to inhibit a-glucosidase. These observations suggest that NN-DNJ might possess a different antiviral mechanism. Nevertheless, we found that NN-DGJ did not inhibit either JEV or DEN-2 in our cellbased assay system. [16] The weaker a-glucosidase inhibitors 39-41, derived from core 4 with eight to ten carbons (Scheme 3), were then evaluated, and we found that 39-41 at 10 or 50 mM did not inhibit either JEV or DEN-2 infection (data not shown) in the cell-based assay.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 7, "end": 11, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 112, "end": 116, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 423, "end": 435, "text": "Compounds 7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 436, "end": 439, "text": "17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 440, "end": 443, "text": "20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 444, "end": 446, "text": "22", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 655, "end": 659, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1037, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2702, "end": 2706, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2934, "end": 2938, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3359, "end": 3363, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3488, "end": 3492, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3507, "end": 3511, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3768, "end": 3772, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1915, "end": 1927, "text": "(Figure 2 A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2104, "text": "(Figure 2 B", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2365, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2472, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Inhibitors 36-38 were also screened against the infection of SARS-CoV by following our previously established procedure.

[16] Discovery of potent human b-hexosaminidase inhibitors In our previous study, compound 5 and its N-methyl derivative 42 ((2R,3R,4R,5R)-N-methyl-2-(acetamidomethyl)-3,4-dihydroxy- 5-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidine) were found to be potent inhibitors of human N-acetyl-b-hexosaminidases, with K i % 24 nM.

The structure-activity relationship of iminocyclitols revealed that the acetamido group at the C1 position is crucial, and that the active site pocket of b-hexosaminidase does not tolerate larger substituents. The methyl group at the ring nitrogen enhances the inhibition activity, whereas aromatic ring substituents cause a decrease in inhibition activity. Our alternative approach to increasing potency is to probe a distant aglycon-binding site of b-hexosaminidase. We therefore decided to attach a long-chain alkyl group with a terminal amine to the ring nitrogen through reductive animation. The resulting primary amine is easy to diversify by amide-bond formation to generate libraries as mentioned above.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 170, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Our strategy began with reductive amination of compound 5 with aldehydes of different lengths to give compounds 43-49 (Scheme 4). These intermediates were either deprotected under acidic conditions or hydrogenolyzed to give primary amines 50-56.

Thus, inhibition studies of compounds 51-56 against human placenta N-acetyl-b-hexosaminidase were carried out. 4-Methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminide (4-MU-GNAc) was used as the substrate. The apparent K m and V max values for each substrate were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burke double reciprocal plot of [1/v]/[1/S]. The K i values were determined from a replot of the K m app versus the inhibitor concentration. Compound 54 is the most potent competitive inhibitor with a K i value 2.6 nM ( Figure 4) . Interestingly, in varying the linkage from N-propyl to N-octyl of compounds 50-55, we observed a trend in human b-hexosaminidase inhibition. Compound 54, with a heptamine moiety, was the strongest inhibitor. In an attempt to further optimize the inhibitor, the linker was replaced by an ethylene glycol chain (hydrophilic linker) to give compound 56 (K i = 60 nM) and by moderate N-alkyl chains to give compounds such as 57, 58, and 59 (K i = 180, 250, and 160 nM, respectively). However, these modifications had a negative effect; this indicated the important role of the amino group and the lipophilic chain in compound 54. As the crystal structure of human b-hexosaminidase B is now available, [43] its complex with 54 was modeled to reveal a narrow hydrophobic cleft in the active site, which is mainly enclosed by the sidechain groups of residues W424, Y450, A447, and L453 and the backbone of residues K425 and D426 ( Figure 5 ). The amino group at the terminal site is expected to be largely protonated when binding to the enzyme. It presumably forms a salt bridge with the secondary aglycon binding site of the enzyme. [44] It appears that the alkyl linkage is long enough to bring the amine end near enough to have hydrogen-bond interactions with the backbone carbonyl of K425 and A447 and a possible ionic interaction with the carboxyl group of D426.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1684, "end": 1688, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2114, "end": 2118, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 975, "end": 984, "text": "Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1919, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Based on the structure of 1-amino-1,2,5-dideoxy-2,5-imnio-Dmannitol (4), we applied a combinatorial synthesis in microtiter plates for in situ screening.
