            "text": "Modern (+)RNA virus studies increasingly rely on the infectious clone methodology (reviewed, Boyer and Haenni, 1994), which allows targeted manipulation of viral genomes. In the classical approach, (+)RNA viruses are recovered from cells transfected with synthetic RNA made by in vitro transcription of infectious clone cDNA templates (Campbell and Pletnev, 2000, Gritsun and Gould, 1995, Kapoor et al., 1995, Polo et al., 1997, Rice et al., 1989, Sumiyoshi et al., 1992). In a layered DNA/RNA approach, also known as \u2018infectious DNA\u2019 (Herweijer et al., 1995), (+)RNA viruses are recovered directly after transfection of plasmids carrying viral genome cDNA into susceptible cells. It was first reported for poliovirus (Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981), and has been widely used for plant viruses (reviewed, Boyer and Haenni, 1994). Recently, it was adapted for alphaviruses (reviewed, Schlesinger and Dubensky, 1999). Substantial difficulties, however, were encountered in design of flavivirus \u2018infectious DNA\u2019, requiring either modification of the viral genome cassette (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) to prevent unwanted expression of viral genome segments encoding toxic for Escherichia coli products, or deletion of the structural protein region (Varnavski et al., 2000). Substantial stabilization of viral genome cassettes by blocking unwanted expression was also reported for a number of plant viruses (Johansen, 1996, Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000, Olsen and Johansen, 2001). In this approach, deleterious effects of spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in bacterial cells are eliminated at the translational level by insertion of intron(s) into viral cDNA cassettes. There may be situations, however, when such modification of a viral cassette is not feasible or is not acceptable. For this reason we sought to investigate if the stability of constructs containing an unmodified virus genome cassette can be improved by preventing its deleterious expression at the transcriptional level, i.e. by minimizing spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in E. coli.",

            "text": "As a model, we have used a highly unstable infectious clone of Japanese encephalitis flavivirus (JE) (Sumiyoshi et al., 1992, Yamshchikov et al., 2001). JE is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever (YF), West Nile, tick borne encephalitis, dengue, and hepatitis C viruses (Kuno et al., 1998). The flavivirus virion contains single-stranded RNA of positive polarity, which is approximately 11 kb in length and encodes three structural and seven nonstructural proteins (Rice, 1996). Viral RNA is capped at its 5\u2032-end, but has no poly(A) tract at the 3\u2032-end. Both virion RNA and in vitro synthesized capped RNA are infectious when transfected into susceptible cells (Rice et al., 1989). In this report we demonstrate that spurious transcription in E. coli can be substantially reduced by utilizing a minimal eukaryotic promoter (Davis and Huang, 1988) to control transcription of the viral cassette. As an enhancement of this \u2018minimal approach\u2019, a substantial increase in the specific infectivity of \u2018infectious DNA\u2019 was achieved by placing the enhancer at the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome cassette. While this methodology does not resolve completely the instability problem, it may be considered as an alternative approach when for any reason the viral genome cassette cannot be modified.",

            "text": "Earlier, it has been demonstrated (Johansen, 1996, Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000, Olsen and Johansen, 2001, Yamshchikov et al., 2001) that interruption of a viral open reading frame either by frameshift mutations or by insertion of introns leads to substantial stabilization of plasmids containing viral genome cassettes under control of eukaryotic promoters. This suggests that spurious transcription from eukaryotic promoters in E. coli (Antonucci et al., 1989, Davis and Huang, 1988) may substantially contribute to the observed instability of such constructs. As an alternative to the mentioned above modification of viral genome cassettes, we sought to explore if a decrease of such spurious transcription can eliminate the destabilizing effect of eukaryotic promoters on \u2018infectious DNA\u2019 constructs. The powerful and versatile CMV promoter, often used to drive expression of engineered constructs in a variety of mammalian cells (Foecking and Hofstetter, 1986), consists of a transcriptionally active minimal promoter region of approximately 100 bp immediately adjacent to the RNA transcription start, and of an about 600 bp upstream enhancer element, which displays only a minute transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (Thomsen et al., 1984). To determine if the enhancer has any effect on the promoter activity in E. coli, we designed plasmids pBR/luc (no promoter), pCMV/luc (full promoter), pCMVmp/luc (no enhancer), and a pair of plasmids pCMVmp/luc-enhD and pCMVmp/luc-enhR containing the enhancer relocated to the end of the reporter gene (Fig. 1A). Comparative evaluation of luciferase production in E. coli transformed with the above plasmids, shown in Fig. 1B, indicated that deletion of the enhancer leads to a 5\u20136-fold reduction of luciferase gene expression. In contrast to position-independent function of enhancers in mammalian cells (Jonsson et al., 1994), and certain activators in prokaryotic cells (Molina-Lopez and Santero, 1999), the CMV enhancer relocated downstream from the reporter gene had no discernible effect on production of luciferase in E. coli.",

A positive effect of flavivirus 5\u2032-UTR on the translation efficiency of synthetic RNA in cell-free systems has been reported earlier (Preugschat et al., 1990, Ruiz-Linares et al., 1989). Since an enhancing effect of flavivirus 5\u2032-UTR on translation would be beneficial in the devised \u2018minimal\u2019 approach, we were interested to determine if such enhancing effect can be observed with JE 5\u2032-UTR in vivo. To address this question, we designed plasmids pCMV5\u2032UTR-JE/luc and pCMVmp5\u2032UTR-JE/luc (Fig. 1A), in which the first 69 nucleotides of JE 5\u2032-UTR have been placed between the luciferase reporter gene and the CMV or minimal CMV promoters, respectively. The effect of 5\u2032-UTR was accessed by measuring luciferase activity in lysates of BHK cells transiently transfected with these plasmids and with plasmids pCMV/luc and pCMVmp/luc (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, luciferase production from pCMV5\u2032UTR-JE/luc was about 15\u201320% less than from pCMV/luc, and the presence of JE 5\u2032-UTR had no discernible effect on amounts of luciferase produced from the construct containing the minimal CMV promoter (Fig. 1C). Since for the purposes of the present study we were interested primarily in the activity of the minimal promoter, we did not investigate this question in more detail.",

Sequence analysis of one isolate of the pCMVJE5\u2032(943) plasmid described earlier (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) revealed a silent substitution at pos. 551 of the JE cDNA fragment resulting in formation of an additional site for restriction endonuclease Sau3A I (GATT\n\u2192 GATC). This mutation has created a convenient marker allowing to distinguish between genomes of the parent and recovered viruses. In contrast to the similar construct controlled by the full CMV promoter (Yamshchikov et al., 2001), a pCMVmpJE5\u2032 plasmid containing 5\u2032-half (1\u20135576 nt) of the JE genome cDNA controlled by the minimal promoter appeared stable with growth characteristics in E. coli HB101 resembling those of pT7JE5\u2032 (Sumiyoshi et al., 1992, Yamshchikov et al., 2001). Preservation of the open reading frame in the JE fragment was confirmed by its complete sequencing. Similarly, pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) containing full-length JE genome cDNA and the BGH transcriptional terminator (Fig. 2) had the same growth characteristics in E.coli HB101 as the half JE genome-containing plasmid pCMVmpJE5\u2032. To evaluate the stability of the final construct during propagation in E.coli HB101, three independent isolates of pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) were subjected to two transformation-plasmid isolation cycles. Plasmid transformation usually resulted in formation of small uniform colonies, with large colonies observed with a frequency of less than 10\u22123. Plasmid DNA isolated from small colonies was infectious and had the similar specific infectivity in BHK cells. Plasmids isolated from the large colonies were not infectious and had substantial rearrangements in the viral cDNA cassette. Finally, we have reinserted the enhancer fragment into pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) downstream from the BGHTT fragment. In agreement with the evidence described above, resulting plasmids pCMVmpJE(BGHTT)enhD and pCMVmpJE(BGHTT)enhR had the same stability and growth characteristics as the parent plasmid.",

Similar instability problems were encountered with JE constructs driven by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat. This may have resulted from expression of viral genome segments encoding hydrophobic protein domains, which are characteristic for membrane-embedded structural proteins of enveloped viruses and are toxic for E. coli (Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000). A stable Kunjin replicon construct, which did not include genes of the structural proteins, has been reported (Varnavski et al., 2000).

In experiments with luciferase reporter constructs, the minimal CMV promoter was 5\u20136 times less active than the full CMV promoter both in E. coli and in BHK cells. We expected that while in eukaryotic cells ensuing replication of viral RNA will compensate for the decrease in the transcription rate, substantial reduction in the spurious transcription from the promoter fragment will be beneficial for stabilization of the plasmid during propagation in E. coli. Indeed, replacement of the T7 promoter in pT7JE/Kpn infectious clone (Yamshchikov et al., 2001) with the minimal CMV promoter did not result in destabilization of the plasmid or in change of its growth characteristics. This suggests that in E. coli a substantial part of the spurious transcriptional activity was associated with the enhancer, since its exclusion enabled us to obtain a construct reasonably stable in E. coli with the frequency of stabilizing mutations less than 10\u22123. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we detected synthesis of virus-specific proteins in cells transfected with the full genome constructs; however we did not detect virus-specific proteins when cells were transfected with the half-genome construct pCMVmpJE5\u2032. This is probably indicative of a low transport rate through nuclear membrane of non-polyadenylated RNA or/and a low transcription rate from the minimal promoter in vivo, which may also explain the substantially lower specific infectivity of the DNA construct driven by such promoter.",

We reasoned that such capability would be beneficial in our system, since we could increase transcription rate in mammalian cells without affecting the stability of constructs in E. coli. Indeed, plasmids containing the luciferase reporter gene under control of the minimal CMV promoter and the enhancer inserted at the end of the gene directed increased production of luciferase in BHK cells, i.e. only 40\u201350% of that directed by the full promoter, and expression levels did not depend on the enhancer orientation. In contrast, no effect on luciferase production was observed in E. coli transformed with these plasmids. Similarly, insertion of the CMV enhancer into pCMVmpJE(BGHTT) after the polyadenylation signal resulted in a 10\u2013100-fold increase in the specific infectivity as compared to the parent plasmid. In our hands, the specific infectivity of the designed DNA construct reached 5\u00d7105 pfu/\u03bcg and became comparable to the specific infectivity of the intron-stabilized plasmid (106 pfu/\u03bcg; Yamshchikov et al., 2001).

While this approach cannot resolve instability problems associated with the presence in viral genome cDNA prokaryotic promoter-like elements (Johansen, 1996, Lopez-Moya and Garcia, 2000, Olsen and Johansen, 2001), it simplifies design of \u2018infectious DNA\u2019 constructs, in which spurious transcription from an eukaryotic promoter fragment does serve as the major destabilizing factor. Together with the intron-based stabilization approach, it provides a certain flexibility and a choice in the design strategy. The availability of more convenient flavivirus \u2018infectious DNA\u2019 should facilitate advances in studies on mechanisms of flavivirus replication and in design of novel flavivirus vaccines.",
