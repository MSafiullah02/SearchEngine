Innate immune cells will be the first to respond and will attempt to clear the pathogen through phagocytosis and/or lysis. As pathogens have developed strategies to evade the innate immune response, all vertebrates are capable of eliciting a highly specific response by virtue of their adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system can generate humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (see Fig. 14.1 and Table 14.3). Antibodies, produced by B-cells, are the typical representatives of humoral immunity. An antibody belongs to one of four different immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, or IgE) (cf. Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-00710-2_8). Antibodies are able to prevent infection or disease through several mechanisms:Binding of antibodies covers the pathogen with Fc (constant fragment), the \u201crear end\u201d of immunoglobulins. Phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, express surface receptors for Fc. This allows targeting of the opsonized (antibody-coated) antigen to these cells, followed by enhanced phagocytosis.\nImmune complexes (i.e., complexes of antibodies bound to target antigens) can activate complement, a system of proteins which then becomes cytolytic to bacteria, enveloped viruses, or infected cells.Phagocytic cells may express receptors for complement factors associated with immune complexes. Binding of these activated complement factors enhances phagocytosis.\nViruses can be neutralized by antibodies through binding at or near receptor binding sites on the virus surface. This may prevent binding to and entry into the host cell.\n\n",

The adaptive immune system comprises B-cells and T-cells with a wide range of specificities, owing to the unique compositions of their B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR). During an infection the innate immune system instructs those B- and T-cells that have BCRs and TCRs specific for the invading pathogen to proliferate and gain effector functions. When the infection is cleared, most of these B- and T-cells are obsolete and many will die by apoptosis. Antibodies produced by B-cells, however, can persist in the circulation for an extended period of time. Moreover, some of the B- and T-cells resist apoptosis and can maintain themselves for many years as memory B- and T-cells. In contrast to their naive counterparts, these memory cells are rapidly activated and clonally expanded when they re-encounter the same pathogen on a later occasion. Therefore, unlike the primary response, the response after repeated infection is very fast and usually sufficiently strong to prevent reoccurrence of the disease (Fig. 14.2a).\n",

The principle of vaccination is mimicking an infection in such a way that the natural specific defense mechanism of the host against the pathogen will be activated and immunological memory is established, but the host will remain free of the disease that normally results from a natural infection (Fig. 14.2b). This is effectuated by administration of antigenic components that consist of, are derived from, or are related to the pathogen. The immune response is highly specific: it discriminates not only between pathogen species but often also between different strains within one species (e.g., strains of meningococci, poliovirus, influenza virus). Albeit sometimes a hurdle for vaccine developers, this high specificity of the immune system allows an almost perfect balance between responsiveness to foreign antigens and tolerance to self-antigens.",

Although the innate response itself does not lead to immunological memory, it is instrumental in activating and educating the adaptive immune system. Important constituents of the innate immune system are APCs like macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which reside in tissues. By continuously endocytosing extracellular material, they sample their environment for potential harmful materials. To distinguish harmful from innocuous substances, APCs are equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that allow detection of conserved microbial and viral structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Kawai and Akira 2009). Examples of PAMPs are viral RNA and bacterial cell wall constituents, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin (Table 14.4). As pathogens occupy different cellular niches, PRRs can be found either on the cell surface and endosomes (for bacterial PAMPs) or in the cytoplasm (for viral PAMPs). Examples of PRRs are toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins and RIG-I-like receptors (Table 14.4).\n",

An important reason for this is that, although the human body harbors a large number of lymphocytes (ca. 1012), only few T- and B-cells will have a TCR or BCR that is specific for the antigen of interest. By concentrating lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs and having APCs presenting antigen there, the chance of antigen specific T- and B-cells encountering their cognate antigen is increased.

Antibody recognition of B-cell epitopes, whether continuous or discontinuous, is usually dependent on the conformation (=three-dimensional structure) of the antigen. For vaccines aimed to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (for instance, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines), one should take great care that the antigen remains in its native form. Vaccines that should induce CTL responses (e.g., some virus vaccines, cancer vaccines) will not necessarily require the antigen to be in its native form, as the antigen will have to be degraded before presentation anyway. A major challenge for these types of vaccines, however, is that MHCI presentation requires antigen to enter the cytosol rather than the endosomal compartment of an APC (see Fig. 14.1c). Professional APCs, especially DCs, have the capacity to transfer exogenously acquired antigens from the endosomal compartment into the MHCI processing pathway. The process is referred to as cross-presentation.",

Manipulation of the antigen, such as digestion or the cloning of parts of the gene, will often affect B-cell epitope integrity. An accurate way of identifying epitopes is to elucidate the crystal structure of antigen-antibody complexes. This is difficult and time consuming, and although crystallography can reveal molecular interactions with unsurpassed detail, the molecular complex likely is much more dynamic in solution. Once the epitope is identified, synthesizing it as a functional peptide has proven to be difficult as well. The peptides need to be conformationally restrained.

Studies with peptide-based cancer vaccines have shown that these should contain both CD8+ and CD4+ epitopes in order to elicit a protective immune response. Furthermore, minimal peptides that can be externally loaded on MHC molecules of cells have been shown to induce less robust responses than longer peptides that require intracellular processing after uptake by DCs. Another point to consider is the variable repertoire of MHC molecules in a patient population, implying that a T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine should contain several T-cell epitopes in order to be effective in the majority of the vaccinated population. Following these concepts, clinical trials with overlapping long peptide vaccines have shown promising results in the immunotherapy of patients with HPV-induced malignancies (Melief and van der Burg 2008).",

Initially, mRNA-based vaccines coped with stability problems and poor expression levels. To enhance immunogenicity and prolong protein expression, mRNAs were either chemically modified (both backbone and nucleoside modifications), sequence optimized, or formulated in nanocarriers (e.g., protamine nanoparticles). These modifications resulted in slower degradation and enhanced immune activation primarily through TLR7 signaling. Optimized mRNA vaccines have been shown to elicit strong and balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses in animal models. This technology is currently being tested in clinical trials, e.g., for the treatment of prostate cancer (Kubler et al. 2015) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (Sebastian et al. 2014), and has demonstrated antigen-specific immune responses in most patients.",

An advantage of SLPs over synthetic peptide epitopes that can directly bind MHC class I molecules is that the need for antigen processing prevents T-cell anergy. Since the length of peptides that can be synthesized has its technical limitations, multiple SLPs need to be manufactured separately and combined to cover the breadth of neoantigens identified per individual. SLP vaccines have been successfully applied as therapeutic vaccines to treat cervical cancer as well as melanoma (Ott et al. 2017). Neoantigens can also be delivered as nucleic acids (both DNA and mRNA). An advantage of this approach is the intrinsic adjuvant properties of bacterially-derived plasmid DNA and mRNA and the ease at which multiple epitopes can be combined in a single construct.

            "text": "\nThe immunological response to a vaccine is dependent on the route of administration. Most current vaccines are administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Parenteral immunization (here defined as administration via those routes where a conventional hypodermic needle is used) usually induces systemic immunity but has disadvantages compared to other routes, e.g., needle phobia, infections caused by needlestick injuries and needle re-use, required vaccine sterility and injection skills. Moreover, parenterally administered vaccines generally do not result in effective immune responses at mucosal surfaces. As mucosal surfaces are a common port of entry for many pathogens, induction of a mucosal secretory IgA response may prevent the attachment and entry of pathogens into the host. For example, antibodies against cholera need to be in the gut lumen to inhibit adherence to and colonization of the intestinal wall. Therefore, mucosal (e.g., oral, intranasal, or intravaginal) immunization may be preferred, because it may induce both mucosal and systemic immunity. For instance, orally administered live attenuated Salmonella typhi vaccine not only invades the mucosal lining of the gut but also infects cells of the phagocytic system throughout the body, thereby stimulating the production of both secretory and systemic antibodies. Additional advantages of mucosal immunization are the ease of administration and the avoidance of systemic side effects (Czerkinsky and Holmgren 2012; Holmgren and Czerkinsky 2005).",

Up to now, however, only a limited number of oral vaccines (e.g., oral polio, cholera, typhoid fever, and rotavirus vaccines) have made it to the market. Most of these vaccines are based on attenuated versions of pathogens for which the route of administration is the same as the natural route of infection. The gut is relatively immune tolerant to prevent immune responses against food antigens. Therefore, a relatively high dose of antigen is required to induce significant responses. A replicating vaccine provides this more easily than an inactivated vaccine. In addition, oral bioavailability is usually very low because of (1) degradation of protein antigens in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and (2) poor permeability of the wall of the GI tract in case of a passive transport process.",

Moreover, the density of mucus-producing goblet cells is lower in Peyer\u2019s patches than in surrounding parts of the GI tract. This reduces mucus production and facilitates access to the M cell surface for luminal contents (Delves and Roitt 2011), which is of particular importance for the uptake of nano- and microparticle based vaccines. Consequently, attempts to improve antigen delivery via the Peyer\u2019s patches and to enhance the immune response are made by using microspheres, liposomes, or modified live vectors, such as attenuated bacteria and viruses (Vela Ramirez et al. 2017). The latter have the additional advantage of replication induced dose increase.",

Through their various PRRs, APCs are more or less capable of \u201csensing\u201d the type of vaccine that is encountered. This determines the set of co-stimulatory signals and proinflammatory cytokines that APCs will generate when presenting the antigen to T-cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs (Pulendran and Ahmed 2011). For instance, pathogens or vaccines containing lipoproteins or peptidoglycans will trigger DCs via TLR-2, which predominantly generates a Th2 response, whereas stimulation of DCs through TLR-3, or TLR-9 is known to yield robust Th1 and CTL responses. Therefore, vaccines should be formulated in such a way that the appropriate T-cell response will be triggered. This can be done by presenting the antigen in its native format, as is the case for the live-attenuated vaccines, or by formulating the native antigen with adjuvants that stimulate the desired response. Besides immune stimulatory molecules, a vehicle to deliver antigen to antigen presenting cells and B-cells may be crucial, especially for highly purified subunit antigens. Immune stimulatory molecules and delivery systems are called adjuvants. Adjuvants are defined as any material that can increase or modulate the immune response against an antigen. Adjuvants can stimulate the immune system by several, not mutually exclusive mechanisms (Guy 2007): (1) a depot effect leading to slow antigen release and prolonged antigen presentation, (2) attraction and stimulation of APCs by some local tissue damage and binding to PRRs present on or in APCs, and (3) delivery of the antigen to regional lymph nodes by improved antigen uptake, transport, and presentation by APCs.",

It is expected that novel vaccines against several of these diseases will become available, and in these cases, the preferred type of vaccine will be chosen from one of the different options described in this chapter.",

            "text": "\n\nAn adjuvant is a vaccine component improving qualitatively and/or quantitatively the immune response against an antigen. Adjuvants act on the innate immune system.Vaccine 3, because it only contains pure antigen and lacks an innate immune stimulus. Vaccines 1 and 2 consist of complete viruses which in general contain innate immune potentiators, such as double stranded RNA.Vaccine 2 is a live vaccine. Therefore, it can replicate to some extent after administration, increasing the effective dose and extending the contact time with the immune system.Vaccine 2, because it infects cells. Infected cells produce progeny virus. This endogenous antigen source is partially processed and presented in MHC class 1 molecules to Th-cells. This results in induction of CD8 T-cells.\nAntibodies are able to neutralize pathogens by at least four mechanisms:Fc-mediated phagocytosisComplement activation resulting in cytolytic activityComplement-mediated phagocytosisCompetitive binding on sites that are crucial for the biological activity of the antigen\nBesides antigen presentation through MHCI or MHCII molecules, T-cells require a second signal from an APC before they will proliferate. This second signal supplied by the APC is referred to as co-stimulation and only occurs when the APC has sensed danger, by detecting PAMPs. Therefore, an effective vaccine needs to contain both an antigen and a PAMP (often in the form of an adjuvant).Subunit vaccines are vaccines that contain one or more individual components of a pathogen, e.g., proteins, oligosaccharides or peptide epitopes. These can be either isolated from the pathogen (in case of oligosaccharides, toxins or other protein antigens), recombinantly produced (in case of protein antigens) or synthesized (in case of peptide epitopes).The advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid vaccines are listed in Table 14.6. An advantage of RNA is that there is no risk of incorporation into host DNA. A disadvantage of RNA is that it is less stable than DNA.Advantages of mucosal vaccination over vaccination by injection are that it:avoids infections caused by needlestick injuries and needle re-useis easier to perform and more vaccinee friendlycan induce mucosal immunity\nM cells are cells present in mucosal surfaces (such as the nasal cavity and the Peyer\u2019s patches in the gastrointestinal tract). M cells have little lysosomal degradation capacity, are specialized in the uptake of particulate matter, such as nano- and microparticulate vaccines. They can sample particulate antigens and deliver them to underlying APCs. The density of mucus-producing goblet cells is low in Peyer\u2019s patches and M cells do not produce mucus, which facilitates the access of (particulate) antigens to the M cell surface.Examples of combination vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis(\u2212polio) vaccines and measles-mumps-rubella(\u2212varicella) vaccines. Prerequisites for combining vaccine components are:Pharmaceutical compatibility of vaccine components and additivesCompatibility of immunization schedulesNo interference between immune responses to individual components\n\n",

An antigen-presenting cell (APC), e.g., a dendritic cell, phagocytoses exogenous antigens (bacteria or soluble antigens) and degrades them partially. Antigen fragments are presented by MHC class II molecules to a CD4-positive Th-cell; the MHC-antigen complex on the APC is recognized by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 molecules on the Th-cell. The APC-Th-cell interaction leads to activation of the Th-cell. The activated Th-cell produces cytokines, resulting in the activation of macrophages (Th1 help), B cells (Th2 help; panel b), or cytotoxic T cells (panel c). (b) Antibody production. The presence of antigen and Th2-type cytokines causes proliferation and differentiation of B cells. Only B cells specific for the antigen become activated. The B cells, now called plasma cells, produce and secrete large amounts of antibody. Some B cells differentiate into memory cells. (c) Activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs recognize nonself antigens expressed by MHC class I molecules on the surface of virally infected cells or tumor cells.

Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have taken up antigens become activated and start migrating towards nearby lymph nodes. Inside the lymph nodes, the antigen processed by the APCs is presented to lymphocytes, which, when recognizing the antigen and receiving the appropriate co-stimulatory signals, become activated. These antigen-specific B- and T-cells clonally expand to produce multiple progenitors recognizing the same antigen. In addition, memory B- and T-cells are formed that provide long-term (sometimes lifelong) protection against infection with the pathogen",

Activated APCs express co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80/86 which support T-cell activation through interaction with CD28 on T-cells. 3. Cytokines. APCs can produce different cytokines depending on the type of PAMP that has activated the APC. These cytokines provide a third signal to the T-cell by engaging their cognate receptors on the T-cell surface. Whereas IL-12 (red) signaling leads to Th1 polarization of the CD4+ T-cell, IL-4 (yellow) signaling induces Th2 polarization and IL-6/IL23 (blue/purple) signaling provides a pathway towards Th17 CD4+ T-cells",
