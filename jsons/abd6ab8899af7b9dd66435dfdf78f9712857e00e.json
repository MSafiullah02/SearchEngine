From data available in mid April 2003, we predict that SARS would be controlled by June and nearly 1700 persons would be infected based on the SIR model. This is consistent with the known data. A simple way to evaluate the development and efficacy of control is described and shown to provide a useful measure for the future evolution of an epidemic. This may contribute to improve strategic response from the government. The evaluation process here is universal and therefore applicable to many similar homogeneous epidemic diseases within a fixed population. A novel model consisting of map systems involving the Small-World network principle is also described. We find that this model reproduces qualitative features of the random disease propagation observed in the true data. Unlike traditional deterministic models, scale-free phenomena are observed in the epidemic network. The numerical simulations provide theoretical support for current strategies and achieve more efficient control of some epidemic diseases, including SARS.",

Unlike other well-known epidemic diseases, such as AIDS, SARS spreads quickly. Although significant, its mortality rate is, fortunately, relatively low (approximately 11%) [1] .

Generally, current epidemiological models are of two types. First, the wellknown Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model proposed in 1927 [10, 11] . Second, the concept of Small-World (SW) networks [12] . Arousing a new wave of epidemiological research, the SW model has made some progress recently [13, 14, 15] . Our work aims to model SARS data for HK. Practical advice for a better control are drawn from both the SIR and SW models. In particular, a generalized method to evaluate control of an epidemic is promoted here based on the SIR model with fixed population. Using this method, measuring the spread and control of various epidemics among different countries becomes simple. Quick action in the early stage is highlighted for both government and individuals to prevent rapid propagation. * Electronic address: pengliangshi@yahoo.com",

It shows that the extremely infectious SARS coronavirus spread quickly in the public with few protections during this early stage. More seriously, it leads to a higher infection peak although in this stage the averaged number of new cases R is below 30. This prediction gets confirmation in the second stage (March 28 - April 11, 2003) . The peak characterized by the Amoy Garden outbreak comes earlier and higher. It indicates appearance of a new transmission mode that differs from intimate contact route observed in the first stage. We name the new transmission mode explosive growth in the contrast to transmission in the first stage which we refer to as burning growth. Outbreaks at Prince Wales Hospital (PWH) (where SARS patients received treatment) and Amoy Gardens (a highdensity housing estate in Hong Kong) represent infections of burning and explosive modes in the full epidemic, respectively. The revised data provided by HK Dept. of Health in Fig. 2 present a clearer indication for these two transmission modes. The outbreak of PWH sent the clear message that intimate contacts with SARS patient led to infection [18] . Detailed investigations of the propagation at Amoy Garden suggested that faulty of sewerage pipes allowed droplets containing the coronavirus to enter neighboring units vertically in the building [19] . Furthermore, poor ventilation of lifts and rat infestation where also suggested as possible modes of contamination [20, 21, 22, 23] . However, control measures bring the spread of the disease under control in the second stage. Contrary to the increasing trend in the first stage, the prediction curve of the 2nd stage (circle) declines. And it anticipates that new cases drop below 10 before the 60th day (May 10, 2003). Also on April 12, 2003 we predicted number of whole infection cases would reach 1700. Up to April 11, 2003 there were 32 deaths and 169 recoveries [2] . We calculated the mortality of SARS as the ratio of death to sum of both deathes and recoveries, and it was 15.9%. Therefore we predicted approximately 270 fatalities in total. In the third stage (April 12 -27, 2003) , triangle curve in Fig. 2 April 27, 2003 there were 668 recovered and 133, the mortality increased to 16.6%). These numbers are very close to the true data [2] . Precisely the method drawn from the SIR model has been verified for prediction for full epidemic. However, the accuracy is only possible by the first dividing the epidemic into separate \"stages\". This problem of determining to what extent an epidemic is under control is of greater strategic significance. Information on the efficacy of epidemic control will help determine whether to apply more control policies or not, and balance cost and benefit from them. For each individual the same question will also inform the degree to which precautions are taken: i.e. wearing a surgical mask to prevent the spread (acquisition) of SARS. Obviously a way to estimate control level is required. Actually this is a difficult problem because of significant statistical fluctuations in the data. A quite simple method to evaluate control efficiency is discussed below.",

            "text": "Contrary to the long established SIR model, epidemiology research using Small-World (SW) network mod- els is young and growing area. The concept of SW was imported from the study of social network into nature sciences in 1998 [12] . However, it provides a novel insight for networks and arouses a lot of explorations in the brain, social networks and the Internet. [24, 25, 27, 28] . Some SW networks also exhibit a scale-free (power law) distribution: a node in this network has probability P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 to connect k nodes, \u03b3 is one basic character for the system [25, 26, 27, 28] . Most researches of \"virus\" spreading with the SW model, concern the propagation of computer viruses on the Internet, however, a few studies have been published relating to epidemiology [27, 28, 29, 30, 31] . The dynamics of SW models enriches our realization of epidemic and possibly provides better control policies [32] . From the first SARS patient to the last one, an epidemic chain is embedded on the scale free SW network of social contacts. It is of great importance to discover the underlying structure of the epidemic network because a successful quarantine of all possible candidates for infection will lead to a rapid termination of the epidemic. In HK e-SARS, an electronic database to capture on-line and in real time clinical and administrative details of all SARS patients, provided invaluable quarantine information by tracing contacts [2, 33] . Unfortunately a full epidemic network of SARS for HK is still unavailable. Because data representing the underlying network structure is currently not available, we have no choice other than numerical simulations. Therefore, our analysis of the SW model is largely theoretical. The only confirmation of our model we can offer is that the data appear to be realistic and exhibit the same features as the true epidemic data.",

            "text": "To simulate an epidemic chain, a simple model of social contacts is proposed . The model is established on a grid network weaved by m parallel and m vertical lines. Every node in the network represents a person. We set m = 2700 with population N = m 2 = 7.29 \u00d7 10 6 . All nodes are initiated with a value of 0 (named good nodes). Every node has 2, 3 or 4 nearest neighbors as short range contacts for corner, edge and center, respectively. For every node there are two long range contacts with 2 other nodes randomly selected in the whole system everyday. These linkages model the social contact between individuals (i.e. social contacts that are sufficiently intimate to bring individuals at risk of spreading the disease). One random node of the system is set to 1 (called the bad node), through its short and long range contacts, the value of the nodes linked with it turns into 1 according to probability of p 1 and p 2 , respectively. An infection happens if a node changes its value from 0 to 1. This change is irreversible. During the full simulation process, the bad node is not removed from the whole system. We make this assumption because the number of deaths is small in comparision of the population, and there is no absolute quarantine-even the SARS patient in hospital can affect the medical workers. Moreover, the treatment period for SARS is relatively length, and during this time infected indviduals are highly infectious. To reflect the true variation in control strategy and individual behaviour, the control parameters p 1,2 (0 \u2264 p 1,2 \u2264 1) vary with time. In same model it would be interesting to compare with the complete infection epidemic. A small system with 100 \u00d7 100 nodes is chosen. A fixed probability p 1 = p 2 = 0.05 leads to eventual infection of the entire population since all nodes are linked and the infected are not removed. The epidemic curve for this process is plotted in Fig. 4 a) and is typical of many plagues. In Fig. 4 b) various sizes of clusters with infected nodes (black dots) scatter over the geographical map. It contains all infection facts in first 45 days. Comparing to the true SARS infection distribution in HK only slight similarity is observed. The short and long range linkages give good infection dynamics as we expected. The epidemic chain is easily drawn by recording infection fact from the seed to last patient. However, during simulations there is a problem: for a good node linked by more than one bad nodes, which bad node infects it? A widely accepted preferential attachment of rich-get-richer is a good answer [25, 26, 35] . A linear preference function is applied here. With presence of both growth and preferential attachment, it is general to ask whether the chain is a scale-invariant SW network. We plot the distribution in Fig. 5 a) and b) in log-log and log-linear coordinates, respectively. The hollow circle is for the system with 100 \u00d7 100 nodes. The scaling behaviour of it looks more like a piecewise linear (i.e. bilinear) in b) rather than a power law in a). To confirm this we tried a larger system with 1000 \u00d7 1000 nodes and the same fixed p 1,2 in the rest curves in Figs. 5. The solid square curve is distribution of the whole epidemic network. The linear fit for the solid square gives a correlation coefficient R of \u22120.956 in Fig. 5 a) . In b) piecewise linear fits have R of \u22120.997 and \u22120.994. These provide positive support for the original model. The ratio of the cases of first 30% and 1% of whole process for this bigger system are plotted as hollow triangle and solid circle curves in Figs. 5, respectively. The case of 1%, early stage of full infection epidemic, suggests a better fit for scale-free than the other cases since it has correlation coefficients R of \u22120.983 and ratio \u03b3 = \u22122.89 for linear fit in a). For the solid circle curve piecewise linear fits give R of \u22120.995 and \u22120.977 in Fig. 5 b) . So, what scaling behaviour is true during full infection process? With absence of rigorous proof this problem is hard to answer correctly in simulations. We may only draw conclusions based on which simulations most closely matches the qualitative features of the observed data.",

However, it is fruitless to obtain an exact coincidence between the simulated results and the true data as the model evolution is highly random (moreover this would result in overfitting). The control parameters p 1,2 (dots and dashes curves) and a simulated epidemic curve (black dots) with column diagram of SARS for HK is plotted in Figs. 6 a) and b) , respectively. For the simulated data, the total number of cases is 1830 that has a 4.3% deviation from the true data of 1755. Contrary to the above full infection with fixed parameters, p 1,2 are believed to drop exponentially and lead to small part infection epidemic without quarantine or removal. In any case, the high probability of infection in the early stage is indicative of the critical ability of the SARS coronavirus to attack an individual without protection. If SARS returns, the same high initial infection level is likely to occur. The only hope to avoid a repeat of the SARS crisis of 2003 is to shorten the high infection stage by quick identification, wide protection and sufficient quarantining. In other words, the best time to eliminate possible epidemic is the moment that the first patient surfaces. Any delay may lead to a worsening crisis. The long range infections in the model and the world also imply an efficient mechanism to respond rapidly to any infectious disease is required to establish global control. Data on the geographical distribution of SARS cases in HK is much easier to collect than the full epidemic chain. Numerical simulations provide both simply. The full geographical map marked with all infected nodes (black dots) and an amplified window of a cluster is plotted in Figs. 7 a) and \u22120.959, respectively. For a SW network often few vertexes play more important roles than others [35] . SARS super-spreaders found in HK, Singapore and China are consistent with this [19, 36] . Data for the early spreading of SARS in Singapore [36] show definite SW structure with a small number of nodes with a large number of links. The average number of links per node also shows a scale-free structure [36] , but the available data is extremely limited (the linear scaling can only be estimated from three observations).",

Clearly the index node has many long range linkages. It has been suggested that travelling in crowded public places (train, hospital, even an elevator) without suitable precautions can cause an ordinary SARS patient to infect a significant number of others. Again, this is an indication that to increase an individual's (especially a probable SARS patient's) personal protection is key to rapidly control an epidemic. Actually, in our model, if duration of the early stage with high probability p 1,2 is reduced to less than 10, the infection scale decreases sharply. An engrossing phenomenon is the points of inflection in curves in log-linear diagrams of Figs. 8 and Figs. 5 b). All are located near linkages number of 6-7. On average a nodes has about 6 contacts (2-4 short plus 2 long range) every day, although in whole process there is no limitation for linkages. For a growing random network, a general problem always exists among its scaling behaviour, preferential attachment and dynamics, even embedding a geographical map [34, 37, 38, 39, 40] . More work is required to address this issue.",
