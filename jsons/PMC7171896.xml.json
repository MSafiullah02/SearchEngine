To ensure donor availability, some countries have lowered the donation age to 17 and allowed blood donation after 65 years of age, if all donor health criteria are fulfilled. The interval between two whole blood donations has to be at least 72 days. Voluntary nonremunerated blood donation is considered a cornerstone of blood safety and it is advocated and supported by many international bodies, such as World Health Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Federation of Blood Donor Organizations, and the International Society for Blood Transfusion (see Relevant Websites).",

The most appropriate blood transfusion therapy should provide for the missing or reduced element. Transfusion of whole blood can be life-saving in situations such as massive blood loss due to trauma, burns, or extensive surgery. Blood component therapy is used to treat conditions in which the specific element is missing; for example, packed red cell administration in the case of severe anemia (a reduction in oxygen supply to vital organs) or platelet concentrates transfused for an abnormal decrease in the number of platelets. People suffering from sickle-cell disease may require frequent transfusion of red cell concentrates. In the case of hemophilia, the administration of the missing clotting factor (Factor VIII or IX concentrate or alternative recombinants) is required.

It is important to note that donor promotion and awareness to blood donation is also part of blood service activities. This complex work is usually carried out by dedicated organizations/institutions or departments that operate at national, regional, or local level. In some countries blood services are hospital based. The range of responsibilities of the blood services (hospital or nonhospital based) varies, according to the organization of the national health-care system. Usually, the hospital blood service is a transfusion department that bears the responsibilities of storage, selection (compatibility testing), and administration of blood components according to medical prescription.",

After unsuccessful transfusions of blood from animals to humans, and sometimes from humans to humans as well, it was only after 1900, when Karl Landsteiner discovered the ABO major blood groups, that blood transfusion therapy became possible. The history of blood transfusion has shown that once the blood group compatibility barrier had been overcome, there are infectious threats to which increased attention must be given. (For a more comprehensive overview of the history of blood transfusion, see Starr, 1998.) Blood-borne pathogens can be transferred with the donor's blood to the recipient patient. Such pathogens may be viruses (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C), parasites (e.g., malaria, Chagas' disease), bacteria (e.g., syphilis, brucellosis), or prions (e.g., vCJD).",

A large number of patients chronically depending on therapy with blood components or derivatives were proven to be infected with HIV and other blood-borne pathogens. These findings led to more firm regulations of the entire blood transfusion area, with patient protection being of central importance. Other crisis situations, such as the variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (vCJD) infections (mad cow disease), severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu epidemics, seasonal malaria and West Nile virus transmission, and the recent Ebola virus outbreak, have strongly affected the availability of the national blood supplies at times.",

Extensive screening of donors and donations, and postprocessing treatment of blood products (including pathogen inactivation technologies) became part of the quality management and quality assurance operations. A nonexhaustive list of infectious agents which can be transmitted by blood transfusion is presented in Table 1\n. These agents in their early stage of infection may induce a healthy carrier state with few or no symptoms of disease. It is important to note that even if this list is under continuous development and scrutiny, not all agents are being tested for each donation. As of today, mandatory testing of blood donations concerns HIV-1, -2; hepatitis B and C viruses; and syphilis, to which locally significant testing requirements are added. By locally significant, in context, one should understand the local epidemiology (incidence and prevalence of specific infections in the populations) and links with its seasonal variations when applicable. Considering the limitations of testing procedures (infections are not identified during their initial phase \u2013 window period, new infectious agents for which tests have not been developed, quality of tests, and testing algorithm in place), the appropriate selection of potential blood donors should be given its full importance in maintaining safe blood supplies.",

With mounting safety requirements and technological progress, blood transfusion services have become an increasingly expensive component of public health. In countries with limited resources, the safety of blood transfusion is of particular concern. In addition to the gaps in terms of technological progress available in the field, there are often high prevalence rates of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other particular blood-borne diseases (see Relevant Websites of WHO, CDC). There is no generic formula for the calculation of what an appropriate blood supply would mean in size and constituency, and a relative value is usually calculated for planning purposes, based on retrospective analysis of covered and actual patient unmet needs in transfusion therapy. An appropriate blood supply can be defined as a situation in which no patient will die due to lack of appropriate treatment with blood, blood components, and/or blood derivatives and subsequently varies from one country to another.

In evaluating the indication for blood transfusion therapy, the benefits for the patient should outweigh the risks. Several international recommendations and guidelines have been developed in this respect, but these are not always available or used, and in many circumstances the process continues to rest on historically based practices and the clinical experience of the attending physicians. Several studies have shown important differences in usage of blood transfusion therapy within and between countries, for similar clinical pathologies.",

Strengthening the collaboration and coordination with different levels of health care may help reduce blood usage through (1) prevention and education to health; (2) early diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions which may lead to the need for blood transfusion (obstetric antenatal care, iron substitution, etc.); (3) use of evidence-based latest therapeutic guidelines and microinvasive/bloodless surgical technologies; (4) replacement therapies where applicable (preoperative blood collection for autotransfusion; intraoperative normovolemic hemodilution; preoperative and postoperative blood salvage). Optimization of therapeutic blood usage is required not only by the scarcity of this natural reserve but also on maintaining an appropriate balance between related risks and benefits.",

The three pillars of PBM focus on optimization of red cell mass, reduction of blood loss/bleeding and optimization of the physiological reserve of anemia (see Isbister, 2013). Explaining the benefits and risks of transfusion therapies to patients and families is an important element in creating the necessary understanding of this apparently simple procedure. An informed patient will be knowledgeable of the residual risks related to the transfusion if given (no zero risk), as well as be involved in the informed choice of alternatives. The expert patient will be equally able to observe if safety steps such as appropriate identification, skin disinfection, etc., are followed and contribute to reducing the potential occurrence of transfusion-related hazards.",
