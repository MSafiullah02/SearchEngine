We conclude that both systems present considerable proximal and distal risks for disease emergence through a number of mechanisms. The reasons are that they frequently entail or promote human contact with a diversity of wildlife species, unusual assemblages of high numbers and densities of animals, rapid and widespread transportation networks and large-scale environmental perturbation, which are all key risk factors of disease emergence (Daszak et al. 2000 ; Patz et al. 2004 ) .",

            "text": "More broadly, the costs of wild harvest and animal production systems to global environments are enormous and mounting. The resultant biodiversity loss due to overhunting, and ecosystem loss or degradation due to the expansion of areas suitable for livestock, are major environmental and societal challenges in themselves (Steinfeld et al. 2006 ; Milner-Gulland and Bennett 2003 ) . In addition to the threat of disease emergence, these impacts contribute to novel and damaging negative feedback costs and a direct toll on other aspects of human health and wellbeing (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 2010 ; Schr\u00f6ter et al. 2005 ; McMichael et al. 2007 ). To understand the risks, we must look to the combination between direct and indirect risk factors that together shape the disease risks of food systems; for example, the act of consuming a wild animal in addition to the upstream factors, such as deforestation, that can more broadly increase the availability of wildlife for food. To mitigate the risks, we concur with previous authors that opportunities exist to manipulate food systems to provide win-win or more equitable solutions for conservation and health (Tilman et al. 2011 ; Nelson et al. 2009 ; McMichael et al. 2007 ) and to develop or inform preventative policy for better public health and ecosystem health outcomes. This review will focus on two distinct animal-based food systems that encompass potentially very different risk pathways for disease emergence. First, \" animal production systems \" are typifi ed by in situ stocking and raising of animals (both domestic and in some cases wild species) at small to very large scales and from low to very high densities. Secondly, \" wild harvest systems \" typically involve direct harvest of wild, free-roaming animal species (including, for example, \" bushmeat \"). In some cases these systems, and the disease risks associated with them, are nested or overlap. For example, wild-harvested species can be marketed through outlets that are associated with sophisticated sale and distribution systems (Milner-Gulland and Bennett 2003 ) . Conversely, domesticated or farmed wild species may also be released or allowed to roam shepherded or freely in landscapes, providing opportunities for contact with wild species (Kilpatrick et al. 2009 ). Nevertheless, we feel that distinguishing between wild harvest and in situ produced is useful when considering the role of animal-based food systems in the emergence of viral zoonoses.",

Although the density and composition of domestic species varies dramatically globally ( Fig. 2. 2 ), livestock systems alone now account for more than 30 % of the Earth's ice-free terrestrial area (Steinfeld et al. 2006 ). In addition to growing populations, demand for higher volume and higher quality diets has driven these increases, and per capita production has also increased (FAOSTAT 2014 ). In 2013 there were approximately 3.5 individual poultry and 0.5 common production mammals (cattle, sheep, and pigs) raised, on average, for every one of nearly seven billion people globally (calculated from FAOSTAT 2014 ). Facilitating this growth, the global capacity to raise both more animals and more animals per unit of land area has increased, marking an increase in effi ciency and intensity of food production. The highest densities and effi ciencies are achieved with the aid of technological advances that were developed and are primarily used in the developed world (Tilman et al. 2011 ) .",

To put this in context, population growth has been so dramatic over the last century that 7-14 % of all humans ever born remain alive today (Bradshaw and Brook 2014 ; Westing 2010 ; PRB 2014 ) . The same statistics for many domestic animals likely exceed this. The sheer scale and (Robinson et al. 2014 ) global reach of food production systems means that they are also major drivers of ecosystem change. In addition to the direct risks posed by high stocking densities and sophisticated transportation and trade networks, it is the associated environmental and demographic factors of animal production systems that present some of the biggest challenges from a disease emergence perspective (McMichael et al. 2007 ).",

Some populations are essentially dependent on wild-harvested food to meet basic nutritional requirements; for example, in some parts of the Congo Basin, protein from bushmeat comprises as much as 94 % of total protein of the household diet (Fa et al. 2003 ) . In Madagascar, restricting access to bushmeat would reportedly result in a signifi cant increase of anemia cases among children, with the poorest households worst-affected .",

For example, the development of industrial logging in Republic of Congo has led to a 69 % increase in the population of logging towns and a 64 % increase in bushmeat supply (Poulsen et al. 2009 ). The emergence of market-based economies and the commercialization of wild-harvest animals in urban centers have further increased demand. The scale of the trade in wild-harvest meat has also changed considerably due to advances in hunting practices, population growth, and increasing accessibility to remote areas (Nyaki et al. 2014 ) . The trade of wild-harvested meat for food can now be viewed as a continuum ranging from subsistence-based rural consumption to commercial hunting for the international trade in wild animal meat and products (e.g., exotic food and traditional medicine), with this leading to dramatic price point differences Chaber et al. 2010 ) . For example, bushmeat traders have reported pricing per kg of wild meat in Paris markets at up to double the price of domestic meat for sale in French supermarkets (Chaber et al. 2010 ) . Similarly, in New York, USA, smoked duiker (an antelope) from Ghana can be readily attained, although at up to 25 times the cost of the same species sold near its source . Such \"urban\" demand, which also occurs locally, places a premium on wild species and often permits local hunters to earn incomes comparable to or higher than local wages for other occupations, sustaining commercial hunting on a large scale (Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al. 2013 ) . Market factors thus provide a significant additional incentive for wild harvest beyond the protein needs of an individual hunter or family.",

Historically, many human diseases are thought to have arisen as a result of the environmental and demographic changes attributable to the advent of food systems (agriculture and/or animal domestication) (Pearce-Duvet 2006 ; Wolfe et al. 2007 ). Such \"civilization diseases\" include some likely acquired directly from domesticated species (e.g., measles, pertussis) or indirectly, either because domestic animals provided a more stable route of infection for pathogens to enter human populations from wildlife (e.g., smallpox) or due to the infl uence of environmental perturbation in elevating the risk of pathogen transmission to humans from wildlife hosts and vectors (e.g., falciparum malaria) (Pearce-Duvet 2006 ). All of the diseases mentioned above were at one time EIDs, highlighting how some of the emerging diseases of the recent past and present will almost certainly become the diseases of humanity in the future. Understanding the origins and drivers of EIDs is thus of considerable and growing public health interest (Morse et al. 2012 ) .",

The processes involved, however, can be complex.

Transmission interfaces could include: human-wildlife, human-vector, human-domestic animal, human-human, wildlife-vector, wildlife-domestic animal, and vector-domestic animal contact. The diversity of types of contact that have been relevant historically for the emergence of viral zoonoses from wildlife associated with food systems is summarized in Table 2 .1 . In wild harvest systems, contact events have typically occurred directly between a person and a range of wildlife species ultimately used for food (HIV, Ebola, SARS, Lassa, Monkeypox), via contact activities such as hunting, handling, butchering, consumption, and trade. In animal production systems, people have become infected most commonly from contact with domestic animals that had fi rst been exposed to wildlife pathogens (e.g., HPAI infl uenza, Nipah, Menangle), where tending and treating domestic animals for illness resulted in human infection. Japanese Encephalitis represents an example where humans are infected when bitten by mosquito vectors, which acquire and maintain infection after feeding on wild hosts or infected domestic species (e.g., pigs). For diseases more diffusely associated with agricultural activities, infection often occurs via contact with virus present in wildlife excreta (e.g., hantaviruses) or fomites (see Table 2 .1 and references therein).",

An important challenge in understanding the risks of viral zoonoses due to food systems is identifying the relevant transmission routes that allow for pathogen transmission between wild animal reservoirs, vectors, domestic animals, and humans. Transmission routes can be classifi ed into fi ve broad but distinct categories and used to analyze patterns of disease emergence (Loh et al. 2015 ) . These include direct contact (i.e., skin-to-skin contact; scratches; animal bites; contact with body fl uids, organs, and tissues; direct large droplet >5 \u03bcm exposure), airborne (i.e., via dust particles and airborne small droplets <5 \u03bcm), vectorborne (i.e., by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods), oral (i.e., consumption of contaminated food or water; ingestion of arthropods), and contamination (i.e., indirect contact with soil or vegetation, contact with water, indirect transmission by contaminated inanimate objects). Direct contact is the most common transmission pathway cited for diseases associated with food systems, although airborne transmission of virus associated with aerosolized wildlife excreta is also relatively common (Table 2 .1 ). Nevertheless, the range of transmission pathways implicated in the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems is relatively diverse, with each transmission pathway represented at least once.",

            "text": "While the type of contact, mediated by the various transmission pathways, represents the proximal risk factor for spillover (i.e., where and how transmission takes place), other factors may promote or reduce the likelihood that contact events occur in the fi rst place or result in pathogen transmission, thereby altering the risk of emergence. These distal or upstream risk factors also include any condition or activity along any transmission pathway that intensifi es the contact rate, increases the prevalence or diversity of available pathogens to be transmitted, or elevates the likelihood of successful disease transmission given contact (Murray and Daszak 2013 ; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009 ). Distal risk factors could also include other \"enabling\" factors, such as climate or other environmental factors. The key distal factors that have been associated with the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems are summarized in Table 2 .1 . Broadly speaking, large-scale ecosystem and environmental change, including deforestation, land-use change and conversion for agriculture, have been commonly implicated in disease emergence within food systems. Examples include the rodent-borne arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Laguna Negra) that are often facilitated by agricultural land conversion, HIV which is thought to have emerged as a result of the changes in forest access and human connectivity attributable to industrial development, and Nipah and Menangle viruses which are thought to have emerged due to increasing niche overlap and contact between reservoirs and domestic animal species (see Table 2 .1 and references therein). In addition to human-induced ecosystem changes, there are a range of social and demographic factors that have also played roles as distal risk factors, including the trade of wildlife species within markets with sophisticated transport networks and in which inter-species mixing has occurred (SARS, monkeypox), or increased domestic animal stocking densities (agricultural intensifi cation) to meet growing human food demands while at the same time enhancing conditions for viral amplifi cation (HPAI, Japanese Encephalitis) (see Table 2 .1 and references therein). If the diversity of previous disease emergence mechanisms is anything to go by, forecasting disease risks within food systems should not rely solely on historical precedence. While decomposing the risks of disease emergence into subcategories of proximal and distal risk factors can seem trivial, particularly for the well-known examples examined here (Table 2 .1 ), the real utility and application of this approach is for forecasting future risks (see Sect. 4.3 below). Such horizon scanning exercises are critical for anticipating the risks associated with the growth in scale and magnitude of food systems into the future. For example, in industrial food systems, airborne transmission may potentially be an under-recognized pathway as a recent study found a million-fold elevated concentration of aerosolized invisible dust in a poultry barn fan compared to the outside air (Leibler et al. 2009 ). This could have implications for both human and animal health in addition to the spread of true airborne diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease (FMD), infl uenza, or Q fever.",

Climate change is expected to infl uence migration patterns of migratory bird species that are the natural reservoirs for many AI viruses, alter transmission dynamics and affect the survival of virus outside of hosts, all of which have the potential to shift disease risks for this important group of viruses (Gilbert et al. 2008 ). In addition, the link between domestic duck production, which is expected to grow in scale and extent to build food security in Asia, and the persistence of HPAI H5N1 is often synchronously linked to the production of rice.

Current governance and enforcement structures are therefore unlikely to be fully effective and in many cases unwarranted for reducing local demand (e.g., for local populations living in or on the periphery of forests with few suitable alternatives). In this context, some interventions may be low-resource and high-yield, such as working with hunters and foresters to convey risks of collecting deceased wildlife carcasses and encourage reporting of animal morbidity or mortality that can inform disease surveillance efforts (Rouquet et al. 2005 ; Olson et al. 2012 ) . These interventions to prevent initial spillover are especially important given the challenges of infl uencing human behaviors when controlling human outbreaks. For example, the UN recently reported the dismissal of a local chief in Sierra Leone for failing to report secret burials that may have violated regulations intended to contain the spread of Ebola (UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) 19 November 2014 ). However, it seems inevitable that reducing demand for bushmeat will be fundamentally necessary to safeguard species from overhunting and extinction and to mitigate the disease risks. Reducing demand will be easiest for populations with access to alternative food sources. High demand and pricing for wild-harvest species may infl uence hunting practices, including expanding volumes and time of year spent hunting, whereas previously hunting pressure has been naturally limited by hunting for subsistence, traditional techniques, seasonality, and cultural taboos on harvesting certain species (Lindsey et al. 2012 ) .",

The clandestine nature of the illegal wildlife trade remains a challenge for tracking and enforcement, but high penalties have not yet been enacted in many settings; steeper penalties may provide stronger disincentives to participation in the illegal wildlife trade, such that even if zero volume cannot be realistically achieved, a large reduction in volume will still have large benefi ts from a risk reduction viewpoint. Additionally, development projects that encroach into wildlife habitat can be managed to ensure they do not fuel demand for bushmeat. Governments can demand responsibility on the part of corporations to provide alternative food sources for employees and set policies to provide deterrents for bushmeat consumption. Governments could require wildlife disease risk analysis processes to be undertaken for proposed development projects to more proactively weigh risks and ensure risk prevention or mitigation measures are conducted. This type of analysis could be included within existing Health Impact Assessment (HIA) structures, because, while some HIAs include risk of zoonotic diseases from domestic animals and other vectors, few adequately address the range of potential zoonotic pathogens in their intended scope.",

For example, porcupines, snakes, frogs, tigers, and a range of other wildlife species are farmed in Southern China for food and medicine (Abbott and van Kooten 2011 ) . While this has been debated widely as a tool for conservation (e.g., the farming of tigers to reduce poaching), it has not been proposed as a strategy to reduce the public health risks of the wildlife trade. We propose that the farming of wildlife species could reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover if similar health and biosecurity measures are applied to farmed wildlife as to livestock. In this scenario, specifi c known zoonoses are tested for, treated or infected animals removed from a farm's founder wild-caught stock, resulting in reduced risk of zoonotic pathogen \"spillover\" to ranchers, traders, or butchers. Biosecurity measures will be critical to reducing risk because the intensive production of species that potentially carry novel zoonotic agents could result in increased pandemic risk. For example, civets have long been farmed in some parts of Africa (Eniang and Daniel 2007 ; Tolosa and Regassa 2007 ) , and prior to the SARS outbreak in China in 2002, civets were farmed increasingly in China. While the role of civets in the emergence of SARS is not fully understood, it is thought that they may have acted as amplifi er hosts, expanding transmission and evolution of a bat-origin SARS-like coronavirus (Wang and Eaton 2007 ) .",

For example, regions with tsetse fl y infestations affect cattle production through high morbidity and mortality burden from trypanosomiasis; while wildlife appear to carry infection, they are not highly susceptible to it (Steverding 2008 ) . In theory, wildlife ranching may provide a contained environment where disease may be controlled through adoption of effective biosecurity measures. For example, Zambia's wildlife ranching is subject to inspection of animals or meat by veterinarians prior to sale (Lindsey et al. 2013 ). However, the sensitivity of this approach in detecting disease risks is not known; visual inspections by veterinarians may not recognize all illness in animals, especially asymptomatic infections that wildlife may be carrying, and viral pathogens are often not evident in meat without laboratory screening. Challenges around traceability in the market chain also introduce risk if free-ranging and ranched animals cannot be distinguished.",

While current systems are inadequate for prevention and early detection, existing programs may be leveraged as a starting point . For example, many countries conduct wild bird surveillance for avian infl uenza, but screening is typically limited to only a subset of HA and NA subtypes, limiting knowledge of viral diversity circulating in populations (Hoye et al. 2010 ) . Targeted surveillance for broader indicators of viral diversity (e.g., whole genome sequencing or at least typing for all 8 AI gene segments) can provide baseline monitoring to capture changes, including risk potential, over time. Coordinated global research priorities, such as set forward by the OIE-FAO OFFLU global network of expertise on infl uenza ( http://www.offl u.net/ ), can provide an international platform for systematic surveillance approaches and data aggregation and identify high-priority investment areas to maximize surveillance resources.",

Aiming for 100 % detection would be more expensive ($6.8 billion) due to diminishing returns on viral discovery, but even this fi gure is less than the cost of some major single outbreaks (e.g., SARS) (Anthony et al. 2013 ) , and far less than the total costs of emerging zoonotic diseases over the past two decades, estimated to be in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars (The World Bank June 2012 ; Karesh et al. 2012a ) . Globally coordinated, mitigative responses that reduce the risks and frequency of diseases emerging in the fi rst place and are implemented now are forecast to save approximately US$3.5 billion per year over a 100-year time horizon in comparison to a business-as-usual approach to EID response (Pike et al. 2014 ) .",
