Callus culture involves growing a disorganized aggregate of cells from plant explants by culturing on a semi-solid support, which contains nutrients and any hormones required to promote growth of the cells. Suspension cultures result when callus is suspended in liquid growth medium and growing cells as dispersed cell culture. With their relatively fast growth, suspension cultures are widely employed in the study of bioactive secondary metabolite production by plant cells. The advantages of this approach are obvious, as biomass production is rapid than that of whole plant, nutritional and environmental requirements can be easily controlled allowing the production of pharmaceutical throughout the year if necessary, nutrient uptake is enhanced by submerged culture conditions, which stimulate the multiplication rate and higher yield of bioactive compounds.

BP is a combination of systolic and diastolic pressure. According to WHO criteria, hypertension means elevated blood pressure levels above 140/90 mmHg (Lifton 1996) . Systolic pressure represents blood force, or pressure, while the heart is beating and diastolic pressure stands for blood pressure when the heart is at rest. Systolic pressure is always the first or top measurement in a blood pressure reading. In a reading of 130/80, 130 represents systolic pressure and 80 represents diastolic pressure. In prehypertension, systolic numbers range from 120 to 129 and diastolic numbers are less than 80. HTN has been named the \"silent killer\" as it is asymptomatic and the major contributor or risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Gavras 2009 ). In 2000, systolic between 130 and 139 or diastolic between 80 and 89, (iv) stage 2 high blood pressure: systolic at least 140 or diastolic at least 90 mmHg. According to Barker et al.

Although both numbers (systolic and diastolic readings) are significant, after age *50, the systolic number is most important and only 10% of high blood pressure cases are due to secondary or identifiable causes such as medications, or conditions and diseases of other organs. High blood pressure happens when the pressure on the arteries and blood vessels becomes too high and the arterial wall becomes distorted causing extra stress on the heart. Long-term high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and diabetes. Results of high blood pressure include arterial damage, aneurysm, heart failure, blocked or ruptured blood (Table 7 .10).

Intensive research efforts are directed in this very important area of disease treatment, and many important developments may be expected in the near future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug delivery and targeting"}, {"text": "into two groups on the basis of the end result of the process: (i) addition or augmentation gene therapy and (ii) targetted gene transfer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug delivery and targeting"}, {"text": "In this type of somatic cell gene therapy, the functional gene is introduced in addition to the defective gene endogenous to die cell (s), i.e., the modified cells contain both the defective (endogenous) as well as the normal (introduced) copies of the gene. There are two general approaches to augmentation therapy. The first approach was used in the first two patients on whom gene therapy was attempted to correct the genetic disorder called Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) syndrome produced by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. (i) Normal/IDA gene copies were produced by cloning and then (ii) packed into a defective retrovirus; most of the viral genes were replaced by the ADA gene, (iii) Lymphocytes were isolated from the patients, and (iv) the recombinant retroviruses were used to infect the lymphocytes. Finally, (v) the infected cells expressing the A/14 gene were injected back into the patients. The normal ADA gene was expressed in the patients, and ADA deficiency was partially corrected; this resulted in an improvement in the patient's immune system. A variety of viral vectors have been used to deliver genes into target/stem cells. e.g., lymphocytes, bone marrow cells, cultured in vitro. The stem cells themselves are obtained either from the concerned patient (more desirable) or from a matched donor. The reservations about the safety of retroviral vectors are sought to be solved by developing suicide vectors which cannot replicate alter the delivery of the gene. The other main problems of this approach are: (i) low frequency of transfection of stem cells, (ii) stability of the integrated gene, (iii) duration of the gene expression, (iv) lack of proper regulation of gene expression, etc. More recently, interest has focussed on physical methods of gene delivery like Ca 2+ phosphate coprecipitation, particle gun, electroporation, etc.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Augmentation therapy"}, {"text": "The second approach is the direct injection of DNA into the tissues either as protein complexes (in order to bring about the receptor-mediated transfer of DNA into a specific tissue, e.g., liver) or even as naked DNA into muscle or skin. Interestingly, these cells take up the DNA and express the gene product. Exciting results have been obtained with experimental familial hypercholesterolemia, where LDL receptor levels have been augmented by injection of the gene as a sialoglycoprotein complex. The problems in this approach as well, relate to the frequency of cells taking up and expressing the gene and. more particularly, the duration of expression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Augmentation therapy"}, {"text": "The gene delivery methods used for gene therapy can also be used for the treatment of cancer or AIDS.

The first case of such gene transfer was used to disrupt the human (5-globin gene in cultured cells. Subsequently, over 100 mammalian genes have been modified by this approach. Gene targeting can be used either to inactivate (by disruption) a functional endogenous gene or to correct a defective one. The initial gene targeting to disrupt the human b-globin gene used a double selection strategy called positive-negative selection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Targetted Gene Transfer"}, {"text": "The vectors employed for gene targeting are of two types: (i) insertion vectors and (ii) replacement vectors. The insertion vector is linearized by restriction cleavage within the sequence to be targetted; the targetted sequence provides the site for recombination and is different from the gene to be introduced. Hence, the sequence to be introduced is located in the inner region of the vector and is flanked by the sequences involved in recombination. A recombination of such a vector with its homologous cellular sequences produces a duplication of the targetted sequence; this is called insertional recombination. In contrast, a linearized replacement vector has the two halves of the target gene at its two ends. Recombination occurs within the two halves of the target gene, replacing a portion of the endogenous gene sequence by that of the introduced gene: this is called replacement recombination. There is no duplication of sequences, and the target gene becomes disrupted. Therefore, this approach can not be used for gene therapy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Targetted Gene Transfer"}, {"text": "A strategy has been devised to modify only a small sequence of the target gene without the attendant gene duplication/disruption produced by insertional/ replacement recombination.

(ii) The second step, termed as \"out\" step, depends on either intrachromosomal recombination (between the introduced and the endogenous genes) or unequal sister chromatid exchange between homologous chromosomes.

The gene was targetted into a mouse embryonic stein cell line; subsequently, it has been successfully used with some other genes. This procedure is ideal for gene therapy. Gene targeting is the strategy of choice for gene therapy for the following reasons. (i) The targetted gene is changed in a precise and specific manner. (ii) The introduced functional gene is placed in the same context, i.e., it is flanked by the same DNA sequences, as the replaced endogenous gene. And, (iii) no other gene of the genome is affected. The major limitation of the approach is the low frequency of homologous recombination; this problem, however, is being removed by refinements of the technique. The feasibility of gene targeting has been demonstrated in a number of different cell types for several different genes.

However, this option is not considered, at least for the present, for application in human beings for a variety of technical and ethical reasons.In somatic cell gene therapy, the gene is introduced only in somatic cells, especially of those tissues in which expression of the concerned gene is critical for health. Expression of the introduced gene relieves/eliminates symptoms of the disorder, but this effect is not heritable as it does not involve the germline.
