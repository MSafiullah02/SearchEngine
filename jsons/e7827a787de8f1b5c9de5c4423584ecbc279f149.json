Poor prognostic factors include the presence of a large pericardial effusion, tamponade, myopericarditis, high CRP or lack of response to colchicine 8 . Therefore, when acute pericarditis is suspected, it is mandatory to obtain an ECG, a blood test with inflammatory and myocardial injury parameters and a transthoracic echocardiography 1 .",
