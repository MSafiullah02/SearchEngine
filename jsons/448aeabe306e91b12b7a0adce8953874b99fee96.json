However, plasma concentrations of CRP may increase during minor infection and do not adequately reflect the severity of infection, or remain at a high level for several days, even overstay the infection [2] . Besides, CRP may experience an increase during the inflammation caused by noninfectious etiologies, such as tumor, tissue necrosis or operation, which explains its nonspecificity as an early stage sepsis biomarker. Meanwhile, PCT, perceived as the most potential biomarker, is listed as one of the diagnostic criteria for sepsis [15] . A recent meta-analysis of PCT that included 30 studies found mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 and 0.79 respectively, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.85 [16] .

In a rabbit sepsis model by intravenous injection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 24 h after scald, 11 discrepant expression proteins from lymphocyte were found by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry(MALDI-TOF MS). They are related with the folding, assembling, transportation and degradation of proteins, signal transmission, inflammation, immunization, energy metabolism, the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells [79] . In a recent research, 41 differential expressed proteins in the neutrophils from Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis rats were identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry [80] . They included antioxidant proteins, signaling proteins, cytoskeleton and regulatory proteins, energy metabolism and protease protein, which may play a key role in such kind of sepsis and provide potential clues in early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Proteomics-Based Biomarkers"}, {"text": "In clinic, YKL-40 was identified with proteomics analysis on a significantly higher expression level in serum samples from sepsis patients and considered as a possible biomarker of sepsis [81] .

Metabolic profile of the serum from septic rats with cecal ligation and puncture was achieved with the help of NMR and LC/MS [83] . In the septic rats, especially the non-survivors, many free fatty acids showed a lower level which may be consumed greatly for energy supply in sepsis and may be related with the prognosis of sepsis. Moreover, there was a rise of some polyunsaturated fatty acids in the very group, which may have a relationship with the increased anti-inflammatory effect. Based on the metabolic profile analysis, a model for outcome predication was built with high sensitivity and specificity, which provided a novel method for sepsis prognosis judgment. NMR-based metabolic profiling revealed the difference of metabolites of energy metabolism and inflammation in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and serum samples between the septic rat and the control rat [84] . In septic rats, creatine concentration increased in all the three types of samples, whereas alanine and phosphoethanolamine concentrations increased only both in lung tissue and in serum.
