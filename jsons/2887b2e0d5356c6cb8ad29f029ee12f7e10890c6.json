This provides a crude first estimate of HIT, with more elaborate modelling required to arrive at a more realistic value. Early estimates of HIT for Covid-19 were based on this simplistic homogeneous approach, yielding high HIT values that have since been revised downwards with more sophisticated network modelling taking account of R 0 heterogeneity and with reference to the low HIT found from serological sampling in Stockholm County. The aim of this paper is to describe a simple model in which host susceptibility is directly linked to the heterogeneous R 0 distribution, to shed further light on the mechanisms involved and to arrive at a bimodal R 0 distribution consistent with the Covid-19 HIT observed in Stockholm County.",

However, this assumption is simplistic and unrealistic in a great many cases and it is often observed that the actual HIT is substantially lower than given by this elementary approach [3] .",

In practice, however, host susceptibility is also variable and in general those with a higher R 0 value are likely to exhibit greater susceptibility to infection for the very same reasons that they are more likely to transmit infection to others, for instance by working in professions such as medical practice, social care or hospitality where they are frequently in contact with other infected people. A reasonable premise and first approximation that is used in this work is to assume that host susceptibility is in direct proportion to the associated R 0 value., i.e. the probability of becoming infected is proportional to the probability of infecting others. Based on this principle, the R 0 distribution after a small proportion \u03b4p of the population have become infected may be obtained by adjustment of the p-values. This is illustrated in Figure 1 with reference to a population with two R 0 values, R 01 and R 02 (1 and 3 for illustration) in initial proportion p 01 : p 02 . Infection occurs in proportion to the respective R 0 values, giving a change in distribution as follows:",

This requires a quite severe bimodal or multi-modal distribution. An example of such a bimodal distribution fitting the Stockolm data is shown in Figure 6 , comprising a Rayleigh region with a mean close to 1 and a Gaussian region with a mean of 12, in the ratio 85:15, not far from the 80:20 Pareto rule often cited in the context of super-spreaders [8] . This, in practice, may represent the situation where the bulk of the population has a relatively low R 0 , whilst a minority cohort in professions or situations with much greater exposure to infection, such as medical or publicfacing occupations, have a much higher R 0 , so-called 'super-spreaders' [9] .",

Results for a number of R 0 distributions show that the herd immunity threshold is reduced relative to the homogeneous model and may be substantially reduced, for instance by a factor of 3.4 from the Stockholm County data used here, if there is a large variation in R 0 distribution across the population. The herd immunity threshold is strongly influenced not just by the mean R 0 value but by its distribution, and simply using the mean R 0 value for a given population as done by Ferguson [10] for Covid-19 is likely to lead to an unrealistic overestimate.",

This requires a quite severe bimodal distribution with a cohort of super-spreaders having much higher R 0 and associated susceptibility than the bulk of the population. Whether this situation is realistic cannot easily be determined, but it serves to illustrate the principle and offer insight into the likely R 0 distribution responsible for the observed result. In addition to demographic R 0 heterogeneity, spatial and other heterogeneities are likely to contribute to modulation of the HIT, as described by network models [5] , so it is likely that the simple mechanism modelled here is a partial explanation for the observed low HIT seen for Covid-19 in Stockholm County.",
