The majority of individuals with coronavirus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without specific treatment (World Health Organization, 2020a). However, the elderly and people with underlying medical problems are at a higher risk of sever prognosis (World Health Organization, 2020a; National Health Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2020). A model-based analysis estimated that the case fatality ratio in China was 1.38%, and up to 13.4% in individuals aged 80 years or older (Verity et al., 2020). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, because the number of cases increased drastically outside China (World Health Organization, 2020b). As of April 10, 2020, there have been almost 1.5 million confirmed cases in 184 countries/regions, and over 92,000 deaths worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020c; Johns Hopkins University, 2020).",

For instance, influenza outbreaks occur every winter in temperate regions (Shaman et al., 2010). An epidemiological model in the United States indicated that absolute humidity affected the seasonality of influenza incidence (Shaman et al., 2010). Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in China in mid-November 2002, and had almost entirely resolved by July 2003 (Tan et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2020). A study in China that was based on case studies in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan indicated that the outbreaks of SARS were significantly associated with variations in temperature (Tan et al., 2005).",

A published laboratory study by Chin et al. (2020) reported that SARS-CoV-2 was highly stable at 4 \u00b0C but sensitive to heat. The virus survival time was shortened to 5 min as the incubation temperature increased to 70 \u00b0C. Epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between COVID-19 and meteorological parameters; however, findings are controversial (Ma et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020; Yao et al., 2020). A study by Xie and Zhu (2020) reported that a 1 \u00b0C rise was associated with a 4.861% increase in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, when mean temperature (lag 0\u201314) was below 3 \u00b0C. A study by Ma et al. (2020) reported a positive association between daily deaths of COVID-19 and diurnal temperature range, and a negative association for relative humidity. However, a study by Yao et al. (2020) reported that COVID-19 transmission did not exhibit an association with temperature in Chinese cities.",

Wind is a crucial factor in the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases and it may modulate the dynamics of various vectors and pathogens (Ellwanger and Chies, 2018). Median age of the national population is an indicator of population aging; the incidence of severe cases is higher in countries with higher levels of population aging (Verity et al., 2020). GHSI is the first comprehensive assessment of global health security capabilities to be employed in 195 countries; the 2019 GHSI report scored (out of 100) the country-level capacity for \u201cearly detection and reporting for epidemics of potential concern.\u201d HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. Population density is expressed as the number of people per square mile of land area; a high population density can promote the spread of epidemics (Khairat et al., 2020).",

First, the basic models were constructed, including meteorological factors (temperature and relative humidity). Second, the variables were controlled to adjust for regional variation, including wind speed, median age of the population, GHSI, and country.

Therefore, countries where the time of onset was fewer than 10 days prior, or countries with fewer than 100 cumulative confirmed cases were excluded in the sensitivity analysis.

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for our findings. Firstly, studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to high temperature and humidity (Chin et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020; Yao et al., 2020). A laboratory study by Chin et al. (2020) demonstrated a 0.7 log-unit reduction after 14 days of incubation in the virus transport medium at 4 \u00b0C (final concentration ~ 6.8 log-unit of 50% tissue culture infectious dose per mL); over 3 log-unit reduction after 7 days of incubation at 22 \u00b0C, and no virus detected at 14 days; over 3 log-unit reduction after 1 day of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, and no detection afterward. Moreover, a study by van Doremalen et al. (2020) demonstrated that under experimental conditions, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV. Chan et al. (2011) reported that at temperatures of 22\u201325 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 40%\u201350%, dried SARS-CoV could survive for over 5 days on smooth surfaces. However, the viability of SARS-CoV reduced rapidly when the temperature or relative humidity increased. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may be less stable in high-temperature and high-humidity environments. Second, the moisture in the exhaled bioaerosols evaporates rapidly in low relative humidity, forming droplet nuclei that remain in the air for longer, thereby increasing the likelihood of pathogen transmission (Lowen et al., 2007; Tellier, 2006). Third, the cold weather in winter hinders humans' innate immunity. Cold temperatures cause reduced blood supply and thus reduce the provision of immune cells to the nasal mucosa (Sun et al., 2020). Moreover, low humidity reduces the airway cilia cells' ability to remove virus particles, secrete mucus, and repair airway cells, thus exposing the host to the virus (Sun et al., 2020; Lowen et al., 2007). During viral infections, cells release signal proteins to alert neighboring cells of the danger of virus invasion. However, this innate immune defense system is compromised in low-humidity environments (Sun et al., 2020; Kudo et al., 2019). Therefore, the human body is at a higher risk of infection by viruses in low-temperature and low-humidity environments.",

(2019) demonstrated that the respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus exhibited obvious seasonality, peaking in November\u2013December and December\u2013January, respectively. In 2010, Gaunt et al. (2010) analyzed samples from 11,661 patients with respiratory tract infection from Edinburgh Hospital. This study reported that three types of coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43) had significant winter seasonality, mainly causing infection between December and April, which is similar to the transmission pattern of influenza (Gaunt et al., 2010). In 2005, Lin et al. (2006) analyzed the potential effect of environmental factors on the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The results revealed that temperature was significantly correlated with the spread of SARS after adjustment for several factors, including various interventions, the number of medical staffs infected, the number of patients in intensive care units. The risk of increased daily incidence of SARS in lower temperatures was 18.18-fold (95% CI: 5.6, 8.8) higher than that in higher temperatures (Lin et al., 2006). These studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar seasonal trend to other respiratory viruses, and high temperature may inhibit its spread.",

The future growth trend of COVID-19 has attracted considerable attention as the northern hemisphere enters summer. Our results suggest that the growth rate of COVID-19 may slow with an increase in temperature and humidity. However, COVID-19 is in a stage of high infectivity and rapid transmission. The latest study estimated that the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was approximately 5.7 (95% CI: 3.8\u20138.9) (Steven et al., 2020). Furthermore, confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the African equatorial and Amazon rainforest regions (Brazilian Health Agency, 2020); therefore, the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission is not sufficient to fully inhibit the pandemic. Countries must take active measures to control the first pandemic and prevent a second wave of COVID-19 (Leung et al., 2020).",

Second, the number of confirmed cases was inevitably underestimated, especially in low-income regions, because of the low detection coverage of COVID-19. Third, the effects of policies and measures on COVID-19 transmission were not assessed in our study; however, certain measures, such as quarantine, may affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Finally, ecological fallacies may have arisen as a result of using the temperature and humidity of the capitals to reflect the national mean temperature and humidity, and using outdoor exposure as a proxy for personal exposure.",
