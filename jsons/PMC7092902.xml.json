Genes encoding the viral gp41 HR1 fragments N51 (residues 540\u2013590) and N34 (residues 546\u2013579), and HR2 fragments C43 (residues 624\u2013666) and C34 (residues 628\u2013661) were amplified by PCR from gp160 expression vector pMT3-HXB2. HR121 (N34\u2013C34\u2013N34) consisted of two N34 segments and one C34 segment alternatively linked with the short peptide sequences, while HR212 (C34\u2013N34\u2013C34) consisted of two C34 segments and one N34 segment. The sequences of the C to N linker (linker 1) were GSSGG while those of the N to C linker (linker 2) were GGSGG. The genes encoding the proteins were then subcloned into Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Pharmacia) by two restriction enzyme sites of EcoRI and XhoI. A stop codon was introduced before the XhoI site. This cloning strategy yielded glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, designated GST-HR121 and GST-HR212, respectively. N51 and C43 were subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pET-30a and yielded the proteins with N-terminal 6\u00d7 His-tag, thrombin, and enterokinase cleavage sites, which were named after N51-30a and C43-30a, respectively.",

            "text": "Peptides derived from HR2 region of gp41 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 entry, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. One of these peptides, T-20 (brand name: Fuzeon; generic name: Enfuvirtide) [11], has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children who have failed to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs. The inhibitory activity of T-20 provides compelling evidence that the prehairpin intermediate is a useful target for anti-HIV-1 therapy. However, although T-20 is effective in blocking in vitro HIV-1 infection at nanomolar level, large amounts of this peptidic drug (about 200 mg/day) are required to maintain the in vivo anti-HIV-1 efficacy in humans. Therefore, treatment with T-20 is priced about $20,000 and $25,000 per patient per year in the United States and Europe, respectively. One of the major limitations of T-20 is the difficulty of peptide synthesis, resulting in high cost of production and insufficiency of supplies [12]. Peptides derived from HR1 region of gp41, which are thought to either bind to the HR2 region of the prehairpin intermediate or hinder the formation of the internal trimeric coiled-coil [13], [14], possess anti-HIV-1 activity about three orders of magnitude lower than those of HR2 peptides, presumably because of aggregation and their inability to form the trimeric coiled-coil in the absence of HR2 peptides [15]. Therefore, it is necessary to design a new class of molecules targeting HR1 or HR2 of the viral gp41 with potent anti-HIV-1 activity, high stabilities, and low cost of production.",

Lu also showed that the linker in N34\u2013L6\u2013C28 stabilized the folded gp41 core for entropic reasons, without perturbing its structure [3]. Based on these, we made use of the fusogenic core as a scaffold to link another HR1 to its C terminus and additional HR2 to its N terminus to design two proteins denoted HR121 (N34-linker-C34-linker-N34) and HR212 (C34-linker-N34-linker-C34), respectively, which were constructed by N34 and C34 (residues 628\u2013661).

HR121 sustains the HR1 peptide coiled-coil conformation and, strikingly, it has dramatically increased antiviral potency over the corresponding HR1 peptides, which have a tendency to aggregate. The inhibitory activity of HR121 is comparable with those of 5-Helix, Nccg-gp41, IQN17, and IQN23 [14], [16], [17], [18]. 5-Helix (HR1\u2013HR2\u2013HR1\u2013HR2\u2013HR1), five of six helices that constitute the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins, is linked covalently into a single polypeptide. 5-Helix lacks a third HR2 segment and this vacancy creates a high-affinity binding site for HR2 peptides. 5-Helix is a potent and broad-spectrum inhibitor of HIV-1 membrane fusion, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. However, 5-Helix is expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies that results in difficulties to purify it. Nccg-gp41 (HR1\u2013HR1\u2013HR2), which is constructed by grafting one HR1 to N terminus of N34\u2013L6\u2013C28 core, inhibits membrane fusion at nanomolar concentration. But it is also extracted from inclusion bodies. Both IQN17 and IQN23 are synthesized, which is at high cost. Compared with these inhibitors targeting the HR2 region of the prehairpin intermediate of gp41, HR121 is expressed in E. coli as soluble proteins and can be easily purified. On the other hand, the inhibitory activity of HR121 further tests the hypothesis that the weak inhibition of HR1 peptide results from their tendency to aggregate in the absence of HR2 peptide.",
