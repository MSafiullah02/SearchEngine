According to the Imperial College, 2.2 million Americans could die if we do not mitigate the spread of infection [1] . With the incidence of COVID-19 increasing, it may only be time before the healthcare system becomes overwhelmed and forces physicians to triage treatment among critically ill patients. Without an intervention, it is likely that there will be more seriously ill people than we have the resources to care for [1] .",

R 0 is affected by a number of factors including the innate properties of the virus, and the amount/ duration of contact people have with each other [3] . Although we cannot influence biological properties of the virus, we can change the amount of contact we have with each other via a phenomenon known as social distancing.",

The severity of illness is much more dire in this population with a strong association between in-hospital death and older age [13] .

In the absence of any intervention, there would be a rapid rise in the number of cases that could overwhelm the healthcare system's capacity, and force physicians to treat some patients over others. If 200,000 people became critically ill in the same week, it would overwhelm the b100,000 ICU beds [14] . Moreover, it is likely that many of these patients would require a full-feature ventilator, exceeding the 62,000 available [15] . On the other hand, if this same situation occurred over the course of several weeks, it would be more manageable. Social distancing has the potential to slow the rate of infection and reduce the peak of incidence, and then fewer critically ill patients would need care on any one day. The peak incidence could be reduced to a level the healthcare system is equipped to adequately respond to and save thousands of lives that would otherwise be left without treatment.",
