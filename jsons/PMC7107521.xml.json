All of these factors coalesce and intertwine with the diverse social and individual characteristics of the audience when developing emergency risk communication strategy.1\u20135 The need for effective communication plans that enable coherent, credible and timely communication and community engagement during public health emergencies is increasingly being seen as integral to emergency response and planning.6,7",

Over the last decade, there has been a succession of large-scale outbreaks of influenza, including the SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), new bird flu (H7N9) and H1N1 pandemics. These outbreaks raised fears among both scientists and laypeople that an emerging influenza outbreak could repeat the devastation of the Spanish flu of 1918. Governments and public health agencies recognize the importance of emergency risk communication and have invested significant resources in the development and implementation of public health and communication responses to these outbreaks. The stakes of conducting emergency risk communication are even higher during the early stages of an outbreak, as a treatment and/or vaccine is unlikely to be available for at least several weeks or months after the start of a pandemic. Emergency risk communication, such as raising awareness of the disease and promoting health prevention behaviors like hand washing, social distancing and cautioning vigilance among others, plays a vital role in controlling disease transmission.2,6,7 One key importance is to study the association between social and individual factors and communication inequalities\u2014differences among people from different socioeconomic positions (SEPs), racial, ethnic and geographical backgrounds, to understand how individuals access, interpret and act on messages they have received 1,5,8\u201313 and to identify the best ways to quickly and effectively reach diverse populations with important preventive information. For example, low SEP individuals have been found to have lower levels of awareness and knowledge regarding pandemics, leading to poorer behavioral responses when dealing with an outbreak.2,14\u201317",

In this study, we assessed people's awareness of previous pandemic outbreaks and how that awareness affected their awareness and knowledge of MERS. We identified other predictors of MERS awareness and knowledge and investigated the information sources from which people who had heard of MERS first learned about it. We also identified a subgroup of people who had have not heard of most or all risk communication messages regarding five pandemics (i.e. SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), new bird flu (H7N9), H1N1, and MERS) which have erupted in the past decade.

Pandemic communication need to contain clear, comprehensible information about the pandemic offered through trusted, commonly accessed media channels, such as national and local TV networks. Customizing messages about risk to one's intended audience and communicating these messages to them via appropriate information channels are instrumental to running an effective communication campaign.38\u201344 It is notable that minority participants had both lower awareness of and less correct knowledge about MERS and that individuals with lower education and lower income were less likely to have an awareness of any pandemic, indicating the presence of communication inequalities in pandemic awareness among these subgroups. More research is needed on the awareness and knowledge of future pandemics in a diverse low SEP sample to best understand the impact of communication inequalities and how to address them through targeted campaigns. The current findings indicate a need to pay attention to segments that may not be actively seeking out information and to deliver it via channels that they use. Given the fact that few people reported that they had first learned about MERS through social media, our data suggested that national media such as TV are still important and social media, at least in times of pandemics, appear to be less effective. Emergency risk communication has to be strategic, evidence-based and must take into account potential communication inequality.",
