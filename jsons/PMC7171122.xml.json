In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the early use of HFOV has been suggested to be a safer and more effective rescue strategy for neonates with meconium aspiratory syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, severe pulmonary hypertension, or air leak syndrome6\u201311.",

Cools et al. concluded that HFOV seems more effective across various subpopulations of preterm infants12,13, and HFOV has been increasingly used in NICUs for patients who do not respond to or tolerate conventional ventilation. However, few studies have broadly reflected the practices and outcomes of neonates who receive HFOV, and there is a paucity of data regarding the risk factors of mortality or treatment failure. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to describe the evolution of HFOV clinical practice in the NICU over the past 10 years as well as the predictive determinants of 30-day mortality after neonates receiving HFOV.",

Groups were compared by analysis of variance with post hoc Dunnett t tests with the elective HFOV use group as the reference category21.

We found that an OI of 20.5 immediately preceding the use of HFOV, an OI of 21.5 within 2 hours after initiation of HFOV, an OI greater than 23.5 at 6 hours and an OI greater than 34.5 at 12 hours after initiation of HFOV had the highest predictive power of 30-day mortality. For example, the Kaplan-Meier graph is stratified by the OI immediately preceding the use of HFOV, which showed that an OI > 20.5 had a significantly higher rate of mortality (Fig. 1). The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) plot of these predictive cutoff points is shown in Fig. 2, and the areas under the curve are 0.687, 0.719, 0.719 and 0.748 for these four time points.",

Although HFOV seems to be a promising technique for rescue therapy and decreases mortality in preterm infants with refractory respiratory failure, there is little literature regarding its therapeutic limit and predictors of treatment failure. In the current study, we found that neonates with secondary pulmonary hypertension had the highest mortality risk, and the probability of 30-day mortality risk could be estimated by computing the OIs on conventional ventilations before initiation of HFOV and 2, 6, and 12 hours after use of HFOV. These results indicated that the treatment outcomes can be predicted early by the OI cutoff points, which represented the initial severity of respiratory failure and the initial therapeutic response of HFOV use24.",

We also found that the OIs recorded after the initiation of HFOV were always higher than those recorded on conventional ventilation preceding HFOV, which was consistent with other studies1,24. Therefore, we suspect that the data on conventional ventilation immediately preceding the use of HFOV cannot reflect the real indication of HFOV use. It is possible that adverse hemodynamic effects from pulmonary diseases, hypoxemia, hypercarbia or a combination of these factors make these conditions continuously worsen. It takes some time for the therapeutic effects of HFOV to reverse hypoxemia or hypercarbia. In addition, some neonates in the subgroup of elective HFOV use experienced deterioration while receiving HFOV treatment and 11.4% in this group ultimately died. It is possible that these patients eventually required rescue HFOV support or ECMO. We did not use conventional ventilation until maximal support, and those without OIs greater than 16 could be considered as preemptive use but not a primary mode of ventilation.",

These patients contributed to a significant proportion of mortality, which could mask the therapeutic effects of HFOV. Most of the patients died of underlying diseases or secondary nosocomial infections instead of hypoxemia and pulmonary diseases. The area under the curve in the ROC plot was between 0.687 and 0.748, which are acceptable but not very powerful values.

Finally, categorizing these patients into distinct disease subgroups may have led to some ambiguity, which may have resulted in statistical deviations. However, the strengths of this study include the large sample size, the prospectively collected database with detailed and accurate parameters of ventilatory settings at various time points and the concisely defined responses.
