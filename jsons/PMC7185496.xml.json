Children aged 0\u201316 years were recruited who were consecutively admitted to the two hospitals for LRTI. Patients with primary or secondary immunosuppression were excluded. The clinical respiratory diagnosis acute virus-induced wheezing or pneumonia was based on the diagnosis given by physicians in charge, attributed to a combination of clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Initiation of an antibiotic therapy was also based on these parameters. A chest radiogram was not a study requirement. Sample collection and routine diagnostic procedures were conducted in adherence to the guidelines of good clinical practice under approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital D\u00fcsseldorf.

We found a consistent fall of the viral load between admission and discharge in single infections with most of the viral pathogens (significant for RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV single and additionally adenovirus co-infections). Since patients were discharged from hospital when they were clinically improved, a relationship between viral load and disease severity can be assumed. Our findings are in agreement with a very recently published study in children with acute respiratory tract infections that has shown a correlation between clinical improvement and a reduction of viral quantity after 3 days of hospitalization.27 A high initial viral load at presentation may represent a recent infection, a low viral load a past infection, but an additional study powered to confirm this aspect has to be performed.",

A significant negative correlation between the absolute viral load in RSV infections and an elevated C-reactive protein in serum and presence of a leucocytosis was detected. Accordingly leucocytosis occurred in RSV infections significantly less frequently than in rhinovirus infections. It is possible that RSV could depress the signs of infection in blood. Suppression of the induction of interferons by the NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV has also been demonstrated in human epithelial cells and macrophages.28 Purcell et al. recently proposed that an abnormal white blood count is of limited use for the detection of concurrent bacterial infection in RSV infections.29 In contrast, adenovirus infections have been demonstrated to promote acute-phase response with elevated CRP in children.30\n",
