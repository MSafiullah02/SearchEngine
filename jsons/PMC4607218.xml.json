These study subjects were not intended to represent the majority of healthcare leaders in Canada, but rather those at the leading edge of the adoption of the population health approach in healthcare. According to Von Hippel,32 because they are forerunners in a given field, lead users have needs that are not yet commonplace and frequently devise or adapt solutions to serve their unique needs. By understanding the needs and solutions of innovators who are adopting a population health approach, it was anticipated that these strategies could be adapted by others in the healthcare system.33,34",

Only senior-level leaders in health organizations with a sizeable and defined population, and who were perceived to have made an impact on the population\u2019s health, were selected for inclusion. In the Canadian context, health organizations are most often assigned a geographically defined or catchment population (e.g. Provincial Ministries of Health, Regional/District Health Authorities and Hospitals) and/or a status-defined population (e.g. a group of individuals with a common ethnic or employment status \u2013 such as Canada\u2019s military covered by the Department of National Defense, or Canada\u2019s Aboriginal peoples covered by the First Nations Inuit Health Branch of the Federal Government). Leaders of these types of Canadian health organizations were the focus of this study. Members of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Board and the Canadian Population Health Initiative (CPHI) Council, who were in a strong position to observe leading behaviours across Canada, assisted in the development of an initial list of potential interview subjects. Snowball sampling was used to identify further subjects throughout the interview process. Of the 29 senior leaders across Canada invited to be interviewed, 21 agreed to participate. There appeared to be no systematic differences between those leaders who agreed and declined to participate. Interviewees came from organizations such as Regional/District Health Authorities, National/Provincial/Territorial Ministries of Health, Teaching Hospitals and Primary Care Organizations with wide geographic representation from seven Canadian Provinces and one Territory. Senior level leaders held positions such as Deputy Minister of Health, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Chief Medical Officer of Health, Executive Director and Chief of Staff. Urban, rural and remote perspectives were represented in the sample.",

Given the relatively small data set, data were manually coded rather than making use of coding software. Thematic analysis was conducted in three waves.31,35 First, members of the research team individually reviewed the transcribed data to establish preliminary coding based on patterned responses related to leader\u2019s understanding and definition of the population health approach. Second, a full-day meeting was convened for the research team to agree upon common conceptual and operational themes that were consistently identified in the coded data. Researcher judgement was applied to finely articulate each theme, and refinements were negotiated throughout the day to ensure inter-rater agreement among team members. The team identified convergent themes (those conceptual elements of the population health approach that were consistently cited across interviews) and divergent themes (definitional elements that were less frequently articulated but reflected a unique operational reality for at least some leaders of healthcare).36,37 Finally, convergent and divergent themes were validated at two pan-Canadian workshops held in Vancouver and Toronto in March 2013, with representatives from a broad range of health system actors. Although this article primarily utilizes an interpretivist approach, it respects the need to \u2018give voice\u2019 to the interviewees, those who champion the work every day.38",

In this case, healthcare leaders were most focused on the unique social and physical needs of the chronically homeless to reduce barriers to care, improve health outcomes and offset the need for hospital visits in this targeted population:We were a group of community people, not just health care providers, but also policy makers, municipal government, shelters \u2026 All of those decision makers got around the table and said we can do much better at serving this broader community.

There was a strong recognition that many health system performance measures continued to focus on the delivery of healthcare services rather than on the person receiving care. Many pointed out that shifting this service-based approach to a patient-centric approach was a critical first step in orienting health organization goals around a person as the central unit of care. Once the patient-centred approach was in place, then person-centred models could be applied in which the health organization could consider the health needs of \u2018persons\u2019 regardless of whether they were actual users or potential clients. Several interviewees pointed out that once the person-centric model was in place, leaders could more easily argue the need to transition from a focus on patient, to client, to person and to the population at large:Population health is becoming popular. Basically from my perspective it means being client focused \u2026 putting that client at the centre and figuring out what resources are going to be needed to address the issues of the individual. Then it expands from an individual basis to a community or population basis \u2026 and it goes out from there. (Executive Director, Community Healthcare Centre)",

In one example, a northern Community Health Centre reoriented their services-centric primary care model to a person-centric model by investing in a mobile primary healthcare van to improve access to preventive care for patients in geographically remote areas. This solution, while focused at a person level, recognized the transportation challenges specific to this sub-population and found that its implementation significantly improved access to preventive primary care for vulnerable rural and remote seniors.",

Often, personal conviction to pursue the best health attainable of persons and/or populations as the \u2018right thing to do\u2019 was a key mechanism by which leaders enabled and sustained the population health approach within their health organizations. Consistent with previous research, many leaders made reference to infrastructural, political and cultural barriers to integrating a population health approach and a greater need for population health information to better manage and monitor population health.16\u201318 System leaders made it clear that there is a strong need for further investment in knowledge sharing and networking opportunities to help address the unique realities faced among those in the healthcare system and to support inter-sectoral action.",

As more leaders in healthcare apply the population health approach within the formal healthcare system, it is important to understand the conceptual and operational definitions of the approach among these partners to encourage further communication, to develop appropriate incentive structures and to drive future action.",

This study acknowledges these challenges, but its findings generally favour the broad definition in that it serves as an advantageous integrator and foundation for the development of partnerships. The broad definition of the population health approach allows healthcare leaders to see themselves as part of the solution and as active partners in the population health process. Through the broad definition of the population health approach, leaders in healthcare can be leveraged as key contributors to the population health agenda and new opportunities for pooling resources, transforming health system goals and building bridges between actors can be achieved.",

Clear communication will be instrumental in establishing roles and responsibilities, but will also serve as a platform for negotiation among partners for vertical integration efforts to develop complementary goals and organizational priorities. It is clear that there is a need for flexible policies, frameworks and incentive structures that align with organizational priorities and allow healthcare leaders to meet the needs of their respective populations. However, there remains a persistent need to acknowledge those members of the community who may require care but who are not currently accessing services, and to ensure that targeted programmes aimed at improving the health of a particular subgroup do not unintentionally increase health inequity overall.50 To further these efforts, population health intervention research should be pursued more extensively to increase the evidence base for the population health approach at both person and population levels in healthcare and to evaluate targeted and universal programmes.",
