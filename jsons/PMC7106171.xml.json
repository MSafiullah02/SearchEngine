            "text": "Egg-related coelomitis describes an acute or chronic, usually diffuse, coelomitis involving egg yolk, egg albumin, and/or eggshell occurring with or without bacterial infection (\nFig. 1A and B). The older term \u201cegg yolk peritonitis\u201d has fallen out of favor as birds have a coelom rather than a peritoneum, and the offending substance can be not just the yolk of the egg but other parts of the egg. It is common for chickens to have some degree of egg-related coelomitis, and mild cases are commonly encountered at necropsy in production hens. Generally, chickens tolerate mild peritonitis better than parrots. Causes usually involve retrograde movement of shelled or shell-less eggs from the oviduct back into the coelomic cavity because of oviductal bacterial infection, oviductal impaction, or abnormal confirmation of the oviduct. Heavy-production hens or those with inadequate calcium in their diet can have calcium depletion and uterine inertia leading to retrograde flow of egg material. Bacterial infections commonly involve Escherichia coli migrating up the oviduct from the vent.",

Endoscopy is possible but may be hampered or risky owing to coelomic fluid and limited air sac space. Radiographically, a large variety of findings can be observed such as the ground-glass appearance of coelomic fluid, multiple or single-shelled or shell-less eggs inside or outside the oviduct, herniation of the abdominal musculature or an expanded coelomic wall, thickened air sacs, and masses in the caudal thoracic and abdominal air sac area. Lateral and ventrodorsal radiographic images taken with the patient under general anesthesia are recommended (\nFig. 3). If the goal of radiographic imaging is simply to determine if an egg (or eggs) is present or not, then having the bird remain in a standing position for the procedure is adequate (\nFIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). A lateral beam across the table is used for a standing lateral view. Fluid obtained for analysis by coelomocentesis may be helpful and can also be used for bacterial culture. Ultrasonograpy can be used to determine if the eggs are free within the coelomic cavity or positioned in the oviduct (\nFig. 6). A complete blood count and plasma chemistry profile, including total and ionized calcium, can be performed to determine the degree of infection or inflammation, amount of dehydration, liver or kidney disease, and/or calcium status.",

Generally, the more severe the egg-related coelomitis, the more likely the surgery will provide a better outcome than conservative measures, especially if eggs are free within the coelomic cavity. Some clients choose not to have surgery performed on their hens with mild to moderate egg-related coelomitis, and the hens may or may not respond to conservative therapy alone. Oviductal impaction should be resolved with surgery to remove the egg material before it adheres to the oviduct. Calcium supplementation is usually not required as egg-related coelomitis is rarely due to hypocalcaemia and/or oviductal inertia in backyard hens, but it can be given as there is minimal to no adverse effects from giving one calcium injection.",

When separating the hen from other birds, the animal should not be isolated as this is stressful and not recommended. After one 4.7-mg deslorelin implant was placed subcutaneously in Japanese quail, it caused cessation of egg laying for approximately 70 days in 6 of 10 birds when compared with a placebo group.6, 7 In a similar study, two 4.7-mg deslorelin implants or one 9.4-mg implant were placed subcutaneously in Japanese quail, causing significantly reduced egg production from week 1 to week 15 and week 12 to week 26 after implantation, respectively, when compared with the placebo group.8 It is interesting to note that 3 quails in each treatment group continued to lay eggs throughout the study period. After administration of hormones, any eggs produced by treated hens should be discarded, and the owner must differentiate the treated hen\u2019s eggs from the untreated birds or figure out a way to separate her or her eggs from other birds (some even use a chicken diaper).",
