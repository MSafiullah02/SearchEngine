A national deviation from such a directive is subject to severe restraints (article 95 [4], [5] , formerly article 100a [4] EC Treaty).

They comprise the cultivation, keeping, propagation, storage, destruction, disposal, discharge, transport and other use or handling of GMOs. However, there are two differences. One is that Directive 90/219 only applies to genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), while Directive 2001/18 comprises all genetically modified organisms. Microorganisms are defined as microbiological entities capable of replication or of transferring genetic material, including viruses, viroids, and animal and plant cells in culture. 4 \"Naked\" DNA, r-plasmids and cell nuclei are not encompassed by the definition of both microorganism and organism. In the context of pharming, the distinction between microorganism and organism is not very important at the initial development stage, due to the frequent use of cell cultures as well as virus-based DNA sequences as promoters. However, the subsequent stages of development, especially the handling of GM plants and animals after genetic modification, are no longer covered by directive 90/219. Since the scope of application of the national laws and regulations on contained use extends to all GMOs, especially transgenic animals and plants, this restriction does not mean that there are no rules on contained use in place. The second and fundamental difference between the two directives concerns the kind of handling. While Directive 90/219 and implementing national laws apply to the contained use of GMMs, releases of GMOs into the environment, including placing them on the market, are covered by Directive 2001/18.",

            "text": "From an environmental perspective, the operator can in principle choose between the two regimes. Development with containment under Directive 90/219 and national laws on contained use can be carried out in order to secure an authorization for the finished pharmaceutical product under Regulation 726/2004 . This is especially attractive in animal pharming because the number of animals needed for development is limited. Even in plant pharming, development with containment, for example in glass-houses, would make sense. Alternatively, the operator can start development operations without containment under the regime of the release directive, and then initiate the authorization procedure for the medicinal product derived from the transgenic plants or animals. Finally, the operator can divide the development process into twophases, firstusing thecontained usedirective and later on switching over to the release directive. The operator might consider it useful to gain experience with a release, especially if he/she wants to perform the later production in an open system under part C of Directive 2001/18, or wants to introduce the transgenic plant as seed (see section 8.7). Directive 2001/18 is based on the \"step by step\" principle of continuous generation of new knowledge, whereby containment of GMOs is gradually reduced and the scale of release increased if the evaluation of the earlier steps, in terms of humanhealthand theenvironment,indicates that thenext step can be taken (Directive 2001/18, recital 24) . 5 Although thestep-sequence concept is not strictly mandatory, 6 it may serve as a guideline for the interpretation of the directive. Therefore, it may appear reasonable to follow this line in devising the stages of the development process for pharming drugs. 4 The definition intentionally goes beyond the common scientific understanding of a microorganism. 5 See Winter et al. 1993:49 et seq. 6 Administrative Court Berlin, in : Ebersbach/Lange/Ronellenfitsch 1995 vol. 4, \u00a716 GenTG No. 7. However, Regulation 726/2004 in conjunction with Directive 2001 and the applicable requirements relating to the quality of development pharmaceuticals and the production process for such pharmaceuticals may limit these options. As will be discussed in more detail later (see section 8.5), in contrast to medicinal products that contain, or consist of, GMOs, medicinal products that are merely derived by using recombinant DNA techniques such as the normal pharming drugs need only to undergo the normal authorization procedure under Regulation 726/2004. An environmental risk assessment relating to a release is not required. From this perspective, a release would not be necessary but, of course, possible. However, under pharmaceuticals regulation the production process for pharmaceuticals under development (\"developmental pharmaceuticals\") requires a considerable degree of protection from risks from the environment in order to ensure a sufficient quality and safety of the product to be submitted for testing, especially clinical testing. This may limit or even exclude the use of the release regime, at least with respect to animal pharming (see sections 8.4, 8.5 .3).",

The contained use and release of transgenic plants are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 7701-7758) and implementing regulations(7C.F.R part 340),providedthe GMOconstitutes aplant pest.Aplant pest includes bacteria, fungi, viruses or similar organisms, as well as infectious agents or substances that may cause damage to plants (7 C.F.R \u00a7340.1). Although the regulations assume that introduced genetic material that encodes products intended for pharmaceutical use may be covered (7 C.F.R \u00a7340.3 [b] [4] [iii]), pharmaceutically active agents produced in pharming activities, for example vaccines or antibodies, as such are not encompassed by this definition. Rather, it is necessary that the donor or recipient organism, or the vector or vector organism constitutes a plant pest, which may be the case where gene fragments from pathogens, viruses or bacteria are used as promoters. 7 Theregulatoryactivitiesofthe US Department of Agriculture (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service -APHIS) relating to GMOs focus on the release of transgenic plants used for the production of food and feed. However, transgenic plants for pharmaceutical and industrial use are also regulated. There is as yet no parallel regulation of transgenic animals. However, powers to regulate exist under the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 8301-8317), and the US Department of Agriculture is considering regulating transgenic animals in the future. 8 As in Europe, the regulation of medicinal products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 301-399), administered by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research -CBER -and Center for Veterinary Medicine -CVM), also addresses safety and quality issues of products under development derived from transgenic plants or animals.

            "text": "Directive 90/219, which may be applicable to the initial development of recombinant medicinal products with containment, aims for the protection of human health and the environment from risks arising from activities that engender the use of GMMs and hence also initial pharming operations. Although the formulation of the relevant article 1 of the directive, even after the fundamental reform of 1998, does not contain any language to the extent that it could be an expression of precautionary elements, the directive has to be interpreted in conformity with the precautionary principle laid down in article 174 [2] EC Treaty. This is not only suggested by the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, 9 but also by the recitals of the directive (recitals 1 and 3) and its article 5, which requires the member states to avoida dverse effectso nh uman health andthe environmentw hich might arise from the contained use of GMMs. Moreover, as can be derived from the definition of accident, the directive aims to minimize the risk of escape of GMMs into the environment as well as exposure of workers. The definition of accident that hast ob ep revented refers to mere hazardst oh uman health and the environment (article 2 [d] ). In view of the uncertain nature of risks presented by GMMs and the resulting impossibility of a definitive risk assessment, this application of the precautionary principle is indispensable. Directive 90/219 employs a system of four risk classifications (containment categories) ranging from no or negligible to high risks, which trigger containment measures of increasing stringency. 10 The attribution of a par-8 Based on 7 U.S.C. \u00a78303; see 72 Fed. Reg. 69762-63 (2007) . Animal cloning is already regulated; see 73 Fed. Reg. 2923 Reg. (2008 . ticular activity to one of the risk categories must be based on a risk assessment to be performed by the operator, using the criteria contained in annex III (article 5 [2], [3] ), and notified to the competent authority. The factors to be considered concern the risk potential presented by the recipient organism, the genetically modified insertion, the vector, the donor organism and the resulting GMM, the characterization of the activity and the severity and likelihood of harm. Classification is the responsibility of the operator. As a safeguard against under-classification by the operator, the directive (article 4 [4] ) provides that, in case of doubt, the more stringent category shall be applied unless sufficient evidence, in agreement with the competent authority, justifies the application of the less stringent measures. The competent authority has a margin of discretion in attributing a particular use to a risk class. 11 The directive prescribes a consent procedure when premises are used for contained use of GMMs (maximum delay: 90 days; article 10). This requirement is limited to the risk classes 3 and 4. In other cases, a notification is sufficient. Articles 8 and 9, in conjunction with article 11 [2], [3] of the directive, mandate the member states to grant their authorities sufficient powers to review all notifications, the correctness of the risk assessment including the classification of the activity in question, and the suitability of the containment and protection measures proposed by the operator. The operator may also be obliged to set forth an emergency plan for the case of an escape of GMMs falling under the higher risk categories.",

It more clearly spells out the precautionary principle as a basic standard of protection, while following relatively closely the risk classification and duties of care established by the directive. In setting permit and notification requirements, Germany and the United Kingdom distinguish between the facility in which a contained use is to be carried out (facility accreditation) and the process as such (contained use). Moreover, the degree to which national law also adheres to the procedural design of the directive varies. The most liberal regime exists in Germany. Here, the construction and operation of a facility for use of classes 1 and 2 GMOs and the initial use of such GMOs are only subject to a notification procedure (coupled with alleviations regarding repeated uses). A facility and use permit is required for the higher risk categories. In the United Kingdom, facilities for the use of GMMs of all risk categories need to be notified. With respect to the use of class 1 GMMS, a further notification is not necessary. The initial use of all other risk classes requires a consent. A further differentiation between the relevant risk classes is made with respect to repeated uses. With respect to GMOs other than GMMs, the regulations provide that a notification and consent are not required where the potential risk is equivalent to that of non-transgenic organisms. In France, initial and repeated uses of GMOs classified into all risk categories are subject to the requirement of a consent, while some procedural alleviations are provided for repeated uses. Normally, in all countries there are relatively short delays for reacting to a notification or granting a consent.",

However, as recognized by annex III point A and B 4, risk is a function of hazard, probability of exposure and harm, and kind and extent of assumed harm. The requisite probability is relative to the kind and extent of harm. Therefore, one may put the generality of this classification practice into question, especially in view of possible accidents. One of the criteria, among others, that may be considered when assessing risk is the biological activity of the GMOs (see section 3.7). Directive 2001/18 seeks to phase out the use of antibiotic resistant marker genes (article 4 [2] ). This is predicated on a normative judgement, whereby substances that have pharmaceutical properties associated with potential deleterious effects on the possibility of treating a disease should not enter the environment through release of GMOs, even if the probability of a (horizontal) gene transfer associated with the release is considered to be very low. Without an express political decision laid down in the contained use directive or national law, this phasing-out policy cannot be transferred to other areas and substances. However, it calls for a higher degree of caution.",

Under the new article 1 [1] [c] of the directive, containment measures are not only physical barriers, they can also be a combination of physical barriers with chemical and/or biological barriers. The notion of containment requires that the relevant measures are capable of limiting the contact with, and providing a high level of safety for, the general population and the environment. Among others, the \"principles\" require that the environmental exposure must be kept to the lowest practicable level, control measures and equipment must be checked and maintained adequately, which includes the prevention of accidents, and, when necessary, testing for the presence of viable process organisms outside the primary containment must be undertaken. It may be assumed that the interpretation of the broad legal terms \"practicable\" and \"adequate\" varies from country to country, in particular regardingthe requirementofproportionality to risk andthe degree to which costs incurred are considered. 13 In Germany, reduction of exposure even to the lowest possible level is required, which, however, does not rule out the application of the principle of proportionality. 14 In theUnitedKingdom,the concept of best available technology not entailing excessive costs is applied.",

In Germany, the regional authorities are competent, but have to consult a central expert body (Central Commission for Biosafety, Committee on Biotechnological Works). In the United Kingdom the Health and Safety Executive, and in France the Minister for the Environment is competent. In both countries, too, expert bodies have to be consulted (Health and Safety Commission, Commission de g\u00e9nie g\u00e9n\u00e9tique).

A deliberate release of GMOs is an intentional introduction into the environment of GMOs for which no specific containment measures are used to limit their contact with people and the environment. A release which consists in making the GMOs, as such or in products, available to third persons is defined as placing on the market. However, a supply to contractors for the exclusive purpose of performing, or cooperating in the performance of, a simple release does not constitute a placing on the market (article 2 [4], 3 rd indent). Directive 2001/18 is designed to protect human health and the environment from risks associated with the release of GMOs. The standard of evaluating and controlling these risks is the precautionary principle. 18 In contrast to Directive 90/219, the applicability of the precautionary principle is expressly spelt out in the goals provision of article 1 and the fundamental obligation set forth in article 4 [1] of the directive. Recital 8 of the directive adds that the precautionary principle must be taken into account when implementing the directive. Likewise, the national laws and regulations that implement the directive adhere to the precautionary principle. 19 Despite this clear pronunciation of legislative intent, it remains to be seen whether, and to what extent, the precautionary principle really guides the application of the directive and national law implementing it. 16 Reinhardt 2003 16 Reinhardt :1446 Administrative Court of Appeal Mannheim, Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Verwaltungsrecht 2002:224. 18 See Christoforou 2004: 645; Boy 2002:9-13; Calliess and Korte 2006:11/12;  with respect to the predecessor Directive 90/220 : Hill 1994:180; Schenek 1995:182/83,199 Transgenic animals can be kept with a minimum of containment, such as double fencing. An escape of these animals or an intrusion of other animals that then could disperse GMOs into the environment can normally be effectively prevented, 20 although an escape of small mammals or theft or sabotage, for example by members of animal rights groups, cannot entirely be ruled out. The more important potential adverse impacts of animal pharming relate to the transport of the transgenic crude bulk material to the manufacturing premises, if any, the disposal of urine and manure from the herd and the disposal of excess animals. Therefore, the focus of possible risks to the environment clearly is on transgenic plants, especially from the perspective of spread of genes that have pharmaceutical properties. The crucial question is what distinguishes plant pharming from the \"normal\" cultivation of transgenic crops, and whether the legal requirements relating to information and the risk assessment to be supplied and performed by the applicant and the prerequisites for granting the authorization adequately respond to these concerns.",

A number of human health and environmental problems raised by plant pharming activities, such as direct adverse effects on human and animal health and the consequences of possible gene spread, are addressed by items listed in annex III B as part of the requisite information. Adverse effects on human health caused by the genetic modification are covered. Moreover, annex III B lists a variety of ecological impacts or impacts on agriculture that are relevant to plant pharming. This is true of sexual compatibility of the transgenic plant with other cultivated or wild plant species, as well as the presence of such plants at or near the site of release, the ways and extent of dissemination, the 20 proximity of officially recognized biotopes or protected areas which may be affected, methods for managing the release site, including cultivation practices and harvesting methods, and post release treatment methods. Since Directive 2001/18, due to its specificity, considerably limits the discretion of the member states with respect to the information requirements, national law closely follows annex III. 22 The applicant must also include in the notification the environmental risk assessment, which every operator has to carry out in accordance with annex II before commencing the release (article 4 [2]). The risk assessment identifies, describes and evaluates the possible effects on human health and the environment associated with the release and, if necessary, indicates measures for risk management. Annex II sets forth the general principles that govern the risk assessment. Commission Guidelines on environmental risk assessment published in 2002 23 specify these requirements. Although adopted in the legal form of a Commission decision which is in principle binding on the member states, the guidelines only claim to supplement Annex II of the directive and therefore cannot have more extensive legal effects than the directive itself. 24 There also is an EFSA Guidance document on the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed of 2004. 25 Although this document is limited to EFSA involvement in the placing on the market of GMOs, it will be considered already in the development process where a later authorization under part C of Directive 2001/18 is required.",

The guidelines specify these requirements and add to the estimation of the risk an element which is also important for plant pharming, namely that the operator must, in relation to the severity of the adverse effects to be expected, also identify, describe and evaluate the degree of uncertainty. National law once again closely follows annex II of the directive. 26 The risk assessment prescribed under the directive is based on the example of chemical substances. Its transfer to GMOs is problematic in view of a lower quantification potential and a higher degree of uncertainty. However, this is a general reform problem of GMO regulation and not a pharmingspecific one. Within these possible limitations, the risk assessment model of the directive is also capable of addressing potential adverse effects that are associated with plant pharming releases. Annex II D.2 lists a number of risk configurations that are also relevant to plant pharming. The most significant problem appears to be posed by the spread of genes having pharmaceutical properties from the transgenic, cultivated plants to sexually compatible, non-transgenic species of cultivated or wild plants. Thereby the GMOs might establish themselves in the natural environment and even enter into the feed/food chain. This type of potential risk is only partially addressed in annex II D.2. point 2 and 3. However, since annex II is not definitive, risk assessment is not limited to identifying, describing and evaluating gene spread from the perspective of selective advantage and disadvantage of the transgenic plants. Rather, the whole potential direct and indirect risks to human health and the environment presented by GMOs that have pharmacological properties must be identified, described and evaluated. Although not specific to plant pharming as far as the possible causation of gene spread as such is concerned, the evaluation of the risk associated with it may engender different implications due to the pharmaceutical characteristics of the GMOs. Moreover, adverse interactions with non-target organisms (annex II D.2. point 5) cannot be ruled out.",

This applies to about 90 percent of all releases. However, the reg-ulations exclude introduced genetic material which encodes products for pharmaceutical use from this procedural alleviation (7 C.F.R. \u00a7340.3 [b] [4] [iii] ). The operator is obliged to submit information which, by and large, resembles that needed in Europe, but is somewhat less specific regarding environmental impacts such as escape, dissemination and persistence in the environment (7 C.F.R. \u00a7340.4). An environmental assessment may be prescribed where this appears necessary to evaluate the potential environmental effects of the release, for instance where a new genetic modification raises problems that cannot be addressed through normal safety measures (7 C.F.R. \u00a7372 [d] [4] ). Moreover, the assessment serves to determine whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the environment and thereby be subject to an environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act (7 C.F.R. Parts 1b and 272). The latter requires that the decision on the release is a major federal action, which is not normally considered to be the case with pharming development operations. The Department of Agriculture has recently published a guidance document relating to the relevant permit process which in particular applies to plant pharming development. 27 As stated, the development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals from transgenic plants and animals can also be regulated within the framework of pharmaceuticals regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, especially as part of the pre-marketing permit procedure.

            "text": "Basic standard. Article 4 [1] of the directive establishes the basic standard for granting the authorization for a release. Direct or indirect adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise from the release, in the case of plant pharming especially through the spread of genes having pharmaceutical properties, must be avoided. The decision on the application for an authorization is taken on a case by case basis considering the information and risk assessment provided by the operator, but also using other information that is available. This decision-making technique opens the process to political influence. This is most visible at EC level and perhaps less so at national levels. However, its advantage is a higher degree of flexibility and capability to adjust to novel configurations and achieve regulatory innovations. Moreover, it can be justified on grounds of political accountability and democratic legitimacy. 28 Article 4 [1] of the directive has to be interpreted in the light of the precautionary principle, which also means that controversies relating to the 27 Breyer and Heyvaert 2000:330-337. interpretation of this principle may gain some importance. A clear Community standard of decision-making that would have to be uniformly implemented under national law and applied on the ground is not provided, although the annexes to the directive have been literally transposed into national law. This is in particular true of the questions as to which effects are insignificant and whether there are spatial and temporal limits to the scrutiny of a release. 29 The consequence is a certain degree of divergence in the statutory formulation of the authorization prerequisites in the member states as well as in the practice of the authorities that are responsible for applying the respective national laws. For example, section 16 [1] of the German Act on Biotechnology establishes two major prerequisites for granting the authorization, namely that the operator must have taken all safety measures that are necessary, according to the state of science and technology, and that the release may not cause unacceptable adverse effects on human health and the environment.The relationship betweenthese twoprerequisites is controversial. In accordance with the German tradition of applying the precautionary principle and in view of the systematic structure of the provision, one should assume that the requisite safety measures have to be taken independent of concrete risks insofar as the measures are technically available and scientifically necessary as a precaution against, and proportionate to, potential risks presented by the release. By contrast, the second requirement of avoiding unacceptable adverse effects addresses risks presented in spite of such safety measures being taken. 30 Moreover,section 16[1]o fthe Act enlarges the authorization prerequisites by a risk-benefit analysis, whereby the acceptability of the risks presented by a release has to be determined in the light of the benefits conferred by it. Risk-benefit analysis is said to operate as an additional filter for eliminating low risks that are not justified by theb enefitsa ssociatedw itht he useo fb iotechnology. It is not meant to make higher risks acceptable in view of the benefits derived. 31 One can justify this as an extension of proportionality which governs the applicationofthe precautionaryprinciple. 32 Thebenefitsofthe releasecan be regarded as economic chances of placing transgenic products on the market; if these chances are foregone they are costs that have always to be considered in applying the precautionary principle. Nevertheless, it is 29 Lewidow et al. 1996:145,146; Ostertag 2006:339,340. 30 In this sense J\u00f6rgensen and Winter 1996:296; Winter 1998 clear that Directive 2001/18 does not provide for a risk-benefit analysis. Where Community law has opted for such an analysis, such as in the regulation of pharmaceuticals, plant protection products, biocides, and particularly hazardous chemicals for general use, it has expressly provided for it. Therefore, theinsertion of arisk-benefitevaluationintothe authorization prerequisitesbyGermanlaw raises some legaldoubtsrelatingtopossible pre-emption, 33 although it is clearlyd esirable as am atter of policy.T he risk-benefit evaluation does not play anyroleinthe practice of theGerman permit authorities.",

            "text": "In the United States, as can be concluded from the definition of plant pests and the information requirements of the Department of Agriculture regulations, the primary concern of the permit procedure for the release of GMOs is the prevention of risks to agricultural plants and also of risks presented to the environment, especially the environment beneficial to agricultural plants. The environmental perspective comes into play insofar as the competent agency performs an environmental assessment of the relevant releases of GMOs, which normally is the case with pharming development operations. 36 33 Likelihood of effects. In keeping with the precautionary principle, under the directive also such possible adverse effects must be identified, evaluated and eventually controlled which cannot be excluded because, according to the present state of scientific knowledge, the possibility of future harm being caused can neither be positively determined nor ruled out, but there is reason to believe this may occur. The question as to the necessary degree of scientific substantiation of this \"potential for concern\" is controversial. The German Act on Biotechnology (section 16 [1] No. 3) requires that adverse effects that are expected must be excluded. The German administrative courts 37 go relatively far in assuming that, in the case of GMO releases, there are justified grounds for concern. In the United Kingdom, for denial of the authorization it is sufficient that it \"appears\" that a risk of damage is being caused (section 109 [4] Environmental Protection Act 1990). This suggests that reasonable grounds for concern are sufficient but also necessary. The European Court of First Instance, in two pharmaceutical cases that involved the withdrawal of a permit and in a more recent case regarding the listing of an active ingredient for a plant protection product, 38 has decided that a mere hypothetical risk does not permit precautionary action. Rather, there must be some scientific foundation for believing that adverse effects may occur (scientifically plausible grounds for concern), although the court does not necessarily require empirical findings and emphasizes the normative nature of the decision on tolerability of risk. These decisions are of general importance beyond the narrow field of pharmaceuticals law. They have been followed by the Commission of the European Union in its Communication on the precautionary principle. 39 Their reasoning is also shared by a number of commentators. Therefore, one may assume that the decisions set the future standard of precautionary analysis also in the context of national biotechnology law, insofar as it implements Directive 2001/18. As a matter of policy they make sense, even if one considers that the first two cases do not concern an initial authorization but the withdrawal of an authorization already granted where vested interests are at stake. In granting an initial permit the standard of scrutiny may be stricter. It is clear here that remaining uncertainties must be taken into account and evaluated as to the question of whether they are tolerable or not. However, the rule of law and the protection of economic fundamental rights militate against the prohibition of business activities by a denial of a permit, in case of uncertainty, that is merely based on speculative concerns. Post-event monitoring provides an additional safety net provided it is extensive and long-term.",

However, the more immediate concern in plant pharming is gene spread from transgenic cultures to conventional ones, and the entrance of genes with pharmacological properties into the feed and food chain. The likelihood, frequency and extent of such gene spread or adventitious commingling, as well as the safety that can be provided for receiving cultivated plants by confinement and other management measures, are in principle amenable to scientific research although there are limits to the validity of the findings stemming from the long-term and systemic effects of the releases of GMOs. 40 Scientific uncertainty, of the kind which the precautionary principle is designed to address, comes in any case into play where one attempts to transfer empirical research results, gained from a particular crop and physical environment, to other crops and environments. Although this kind of transfer of findings is in principle scientifically accepted, and uncertainties are accommodated for by inserting \"prudential\" elements in the risk assessment process, drawing conclusions from studies relating to other crops and physical environments is scientifically problematic in the field of agricultural and ecological effects.",

Apart from the question of possible causation of effects on human health and the environment, the definition of harm or adversity of an effect is far from clear. Problems of interpretation of the directive, in this respect, are addressed in the case by case evaluation but deserve more fundamental discussion. The first starting point is the notion of environment, which encompasses all media and elements that constitute the environment as well as their interrelationship. The agricultural environment is included. 43 Furthermore, it is clear from the text of the direc- 40 See Breckling 2004:52-64,68,69-77; Sukopp 2004 :100-113. 41 Fisahn 2004 Anderson et al. 2001:18; Dederer 1998:281/282; Steines 2002:172. 43 tive (article 1 No. 8, article 4 and annex II D.2.5) that direct and indirect, immediate and delayed effects are covered. Finally, as adversity is a qualified effect and more than a simple alteration of the environment, a certain threshold of significance is inherent in the term. It is a fact, corroborated by spectacular incidents such as the Starlink case, that gene spread through pollen dispersal and seed dispersal and commingling cannot be entirely prevented. Consequently, the admission of biotechnology in agriculture by Directive 2001/18 (and its predecessor Directive 90/220) implies that simple alteration of the environment as such cannot be deemed to be unacceptable in principle.",

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which is involved in the risk assessment of commercial cultivation of transgenic crops, also seems to take the same position. 45 In German practice, an evaluation according to the standards of naturalness (equivalence to nature) and selective advantage is carried out. Effects of the same kind as occur in nature, or which can be caused by conventional breeding, are not considered as adverse or at least are considered as acceptable. In the absence of a new selective advantage, adversity is normally denied. While new properties can spread in the environment, one assumes that nature can adjust to them. However, a special evaluation is necessary when a release is associated with a novel process. New selective advantages, due to strong propagation potential and higher vitality, are relevant where they can lead to the establishment of a transgenic plant in the environment. These advantages must be evaluated regarding their kind and consequencesf or nature. 46 In British practice, too, only an additional risk is considered as relevant; factors such as the scale of the release, the genetic predictability of the organism, and the relationship of the size of the genetic change of the gene construct and its likely consequences for the affected environment are considered. 47 In France, one deems risks originating from a release to be acceptable if there is sufficient knowledge. 44 Lewidow et al. 1996:145. It is doubtful whether the concept of equivalence to nature sufficiently addresses, in view of the limited knowledge about the systemic, spatial and temporal interrelationships in nature, the dynamics and complexities of ecological systems. Therefore, it has been proposed to supplement it by recourse to natural variation of affected ecosystems and their development trends, as well as those of affected species. 48 However, this is not an issue that is specific to pharming.",

Notwithstanding the fact that plants may contain pharmaceutical properties, the kind of genetic modification that is generated by pharming -for example the introduction of pharmaceutical properties based on human or animal antibodies or vaccines into plants -is alien because it could not be brought about by conventional breeding. Therefore it constitutes a potentially adverse effect per se. This requires a case by case evaluation as to the effects on nature.",

            "text": "There is another reason why the appropriateness of the criteria of naturalness and selective advantage for determining adversity is limited. They are geared to structural effects on the environment, and do not necessarily address the protection of human and animal health. The same is true of eco-toxic effects, as the case of transgenic Bt-maize shows. In this field, certain properties of a transgenic plant as such may constitute a potential adverse effect. Pathogenic, toxic and allergenic effects presented by transgenic plants must, in principle, be classified as adverse, independent of whether they are directly associated with the inserted gene sequence or caused indirectly by a change in the metabolism of the plant. The same is true of eco-toxic effects. A qualification of this classification may ensue from considering significance (threshold concentrations) and exposure. 49 In the latter respect, the dispersal behaviour, the propagation patterns, the existence of sexually compatible food or feed plant or wild plant species as well as the selective advantage of the transgenic plant species, independent of the genetic modification, are most important. The analysis of naturalness and selective advantage of a transgenic plant is not relevant when exposure cannot be ruled out. Selective advantage may come into play, as an additional factor, in order to determine the kind and extent of exposure but is not essential. An adverse effect on human and animal health may also be constituted by compromise of prophylactic or therapeutic medical or veterinary treatments. The involuntary intake of GMOs in food or feed may cause resistance to pharmaceuticals. Such effects may occur either by gene spread and the resulting propagation of transgenic cultivated plants on neighbouring fields, or by adventitious commingling. Directive 2001/18 contains a phase-out programme for antibiotic resistant marker genes (article 4 [2] subparagraph 2). This implies that causation of resistance to treatment with antibiotics through gene transfer,orotherwise,may constitute an adverseeffect. Moreover,annex II (C.2. point 2, 5 th indent) generally includes the issue of causing resistance to pharmaceuticals in the risk assessment. Hence, under the directive adversity of such indirect effects on health cannot be questioned as a matter of principle.",

In any case, the relevant risks are more difficult to trace and a determination that the risks presented are negligible appears problematic. In contrast to antibiotic resistant marker genes, where the probability of horizontal gene transfers to microorganisms that could cause such effects, according to the present state of knowledge, is very low, plant pharming arguably presents a higher potential risk because some gene spread, due to pollen or seed dispersal, is to be expected and commingling cannot be ruled out either.",

Article 26a Directive 2001/18 and the Commission Recommendation on coexistence 57 conceive the problem of coexistence between pharming, including experimental releases of GMOs, and conventional and organic agriculture as a purely economic problem which may be addressed by the member states. This is based on the assumption that adverse effects on health and the environment, including the agricultural environment, that may be caused by gene spread and commingling during the development process are already practically avoided by confinement and other protection measures taken under the directive. The problem of coexistence in agriculture mainly concerns large-scale cultivation of transgenic crops which occurs on the basis of a marketing authorization. If one stresses the very concept of coexistence between different methods of agriculture, it seems natural not to include trial releases of transgenic plants, the more so since such releases are normally performed subject to some form of confinement. However, seen under the perspective of the victim who suffers economic losses due to a release, the concept of coexistence could be understood in a broader sense. Article 26a [1] Directive 2001/18 generally empowers the member states to take action to prevent the adventitious presence of GMOs in other products. It is only from article 26a [2] of the directive that one could, at best, derive a limitation of the concept to coexistence between genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture. The Commission Recommendation on coexistence 58 seems to interpret article 26a of the directive in this sense, although this conclusion is not cogent. In national practice there is a clear focus on conflicts between different methods of agriculture. However, certain rules, such as the provisions relating to the location registry, cover experimental releases as well.

The following stages of selecting the individual or individuals from the offspring that are a copy of the donor animal's transgenic eggs and express the inserted gene sequence (founder animals), as well as the propagation of the founder animals, could be regarded as resembling so very closely normal breeding procedures that they cannot be classified as a process whose focus is the generation of new knowledge. Furthermore, the initial generation of crude bulk material, and its processing for manufacturing a developmental medicinal product, could be denoted as a normal production process. It is clear that the final production of vaccines and antibodies from transgenic animals following the authorization of the medicinal product is a production process, even if associated with interventions in the animals. 61 However, one must make a clear distinction between the development and production stages of pharming. ties associated with creating transgenic animals and developing their offspring to the stage of production. Even if the methods of transfer of the relevant gene sequences into fertilized eggs of the donor animals and their transfer to recipient females (foster animals) are known, there are no standardized methods. There is limited knowledge on the expression of the relevant gene constructs in founder animals. The outcome of the process is uncertain (see section 2.3). Therefore, the development process entails a fair degree of applied research. This is true of the gene transfer to the eggs of the donor animal as well as their reproduction in a suitable founder animal and in the latter's direct offspring. Therefore, good arguments militate for the proposition that the development stage can still be considered to constitute a series of animal trials. This seems to be the position of German and British practice, which treats the creation of transgenic animals up to the second generation of offspring (founder animal and two generations of progeny) as animal trials. 62",

However, it is important to note that article 20a Federal Constitution does not afford absolute protection but, rather, only requires responsible treatment of animals. 65 The German Animal Protection Act in its new version of 2006 describes the purpose of the law, in ethical terms, to protect life and welfare of animals in \"responsibility of man for the animals in their capacity as co-creatures\", but, in an anthropocentric stance, goes on to prohibit the infliction of pain, suffering or harm to animals without a reasonable cause (section 1). 66 Sections 7-9 of the law contain more specific provisions on animal trials, so that the general justification requirement under section 1 is not relevant here.",

It is defined so as to include interventions in, and treatment of, animals or genetic material for trial purposes which are associated with pain, suffering and harm to these animals or, in the case of genetic material, pain, suf- fering or harm to the genetically modified animals or their founder animals (section 7 [1]). In the case of genetically modified animals, breeding up to the second generation after the founder animal is considered an animal trial. 67 Animal trials need to be justified by a variety of particular purposes described in the law, among others the prevention, determination or treatment of disease, suffering, physiological harm and distress, the testing of substances and fundamental research. The performance of an animal trial needs to be indispensable for achieving this purpose. In deciding whether this is the case, the state of scientific knowledge must be considered and it must be ascertained whether the purpose cannot be reached by using non-animal methods (section 7 [2]). Apart from this general justification requirement, the law prescribes an ethical justification whenever the trial is to be performed on vertebrates. This goes beyond Directive 86/609. Vertebrate animal trials may only be carried out when the expected pain, suffering or harm caused to the animals is ethically justifiable in relation to the purpose of the trial. Where such animal trials lead to longer lasting or repetitive considerable pain, suffering or harm, the review standard is strengthened. There must be reason to believe that the envisaged results will be of outstanding importance for the essential needs of humans or animals, including the solution of scientific problems (section 7 [3]). This is a severe restriction of animal trials, because it practically limits such animal trials to the prevention, determination and treatment of serious diseases. 68 However, as a rule, it does not concern pharming operations as they are not normally associated with the degree of pain, suffering or harm that the law has in mind.",

            "text": "However, the heuristic value of such classifications seems to be limited. It is clear from the text of the German Animal Protection Act, especially its inclusion of interventions into genetic material in the definition of animal trial, that the provisions relating to justification, ethical review and the 3-R concept also apply to animal trials in the course of generating and propagating transgenic animals for the production of pharmaceuticals. One also sustains that from a policy point of view, the existing law is sufficient. 73 An important issue is whether, and to what extent, cost savings ultimately expected from the results of an animal trial can be listed on the positive side of the balance. Section 9 [2] No. 3 of the German Animal Protection Act expressly excludes any cost argument with respect to the performance of an animal trial as an element of the evaluation of indispensability for the intended purpose. Pain, suffering and harm may not be inflicted on an animal in order to achieve savings in work, time or costs. From the systematic position of this provision in the act, one might conclude that it only relates to the question as to how an animal trial is performed and not to the ethical review that scrutinizes the question as to whether an animal trial may be permissible at all, in other words that it only concerns trial costs 70 Kluge 1994 :871. 71 See Bundesamt f\u00fcr Veterin\u00e4rwesen 1994 Goetschel, in: Kluge 2002, \u00a77 No. 60; Maisack 2007 Maisack :197, 2002 In favour of a differentiation within this category Scharmann and Teutsch 1994:191; De Cock Buning & Theune 1994:107. 73 Lorz and Metzger 1999: \u00a7 7 Nos. 14 et seq.; Gruber and Kolar 1997:373 et seq.; Gruber 1995:239. 8.3 Development phase II: Animal protection rather than cost savings achieved by exploiting the results of the trial. However, there is some authority to the contrary, although relating to the general justification clause set forth in sections 1 and 2 of the act. 74 Even if one adhered to this broad interpretation, this would only exclude the consideration of individual cost savings of the operators, not economic cost savings of society as a whole. In the market for medicinal products, rapid availability of new products and a cheap supply to social health care systems are, in particular in societies with an aging population, important and legitimate factors on the positive side of the cost-benefit balance that should not come under the verdict of mere costs savings for the operator. 75 Moreover, it does not appear permissible to look at the \"purpose behind the purpose\" when deciding on indispensability. Innovation and competition in the market, through the development of new pharmaceuticals, is considered as legitimate purposes. The question as to whether a new pharmaceutical, whose development requires animal testing, is needed on the market is not a relevant question in this context, even if this development \"only\" serves the ultimate purpose of saving costs (nor is it under pharmaceuticals regulation; see section 8.5.3). In order to establish an animal production platform, animal trials are indispensable. Therefore, there is no cogent reason to deal with this production method in a way that is fundamentally different from normal development operations. At best, the broader perspective -the purpose behind the purpose -can be considered in the ethical review process, and here the considerations relating to societal costs appear entirely legitimate. Of course, based on a need analysis, the legislature could ban animal trials in the development process entirely -as has been done with respect to cosmetics. However, such a fundamental decision should not be taken by the executive and the courts through the interpretation of existing law but rather politically, and it could not be confined just to pharming products. Another open question relates to the relevance of animal welfare risk analysis. The definition of animal trial (section 7 [1] German Animal Protection Act) refers to the mere possibility that a trial may be associated with pain, suffering or harm to the animal. However, in the framework of ethical review, Section 7 [3] of the act partly refers to \"expected\" pain, suffering and harm, and partly seems to require certainty about the future causation of pain, suffering and harm by an animal trial. If one considers the latter formulation which concerns trials on vertebrate animals which cause 74 longer lasting or repetitive pain or suffering as inaccurate, as suggested by the context of the clause, the standard of knowledge is that of \"danger\" in the conventional German categorization of risk. 76 This means that, while certainty is not necessary, there must be sufficient probability, based on past experience or other reliable evidence, that the trial will be associated with pain, suffering or harm. The precautionary principle does not apply. In view of wide-spread uncertainty about adverse effects caused by animal trials, including those that are inflicted in pharming development, for example uncertainties about harmful effects of insertion and transgene expression, this limitation of ethical review that excludes uncertain, but plausible future harm short of sufficient probability appears questionable. The Act establishes a general requirement of a project authorization for any trial involving vertebrate animals (section 8). The authorization may only be granted under certain prerequisites, among which the following are the most important ones: The applicant must have demonstrated in a scientific manner that the prerequisites of indispensability and ethical justification are fulfilled and that the envisaged results of the trial are not sufficiently known despite exhaustion of accessible means of information or need to be reviewed, and it can be expected that when performing the trial the 3-R concept is complied with (section 8 [3]). The burden of proof and proffering evidence is placed on the applicant in a differentiated, somewhat confusing way ranging from full proof to mere demonstration (section 8 [2]). Demonstrate in this context means that the applicant must give substantiated and plausible information to support the application. 77 The differentiation made by the Act reflects both the knowledge available at the time of submitting the application, and the necessary knowledge base for proof of the authorization prerequisites (section 8 [2]).",

Even within the judicature, there is no uniform opinion. It has often been sustained that the authority may only carry out a qualified plausibility control, but may not substitute its judgement for that of the scientists who perform the animal trial. 78 Others plead for a more extensive review of the application, in which plausibility review is limited to the purpose of the trial while all other authorization prerequisites are fully reviewed. 79 Still others take the view that at least after the insertion of animal protection in article 20a Federal Constitution, full scrutiny of the authorization prerequisites, including the purpose of the trial, is warranted. 80 A decision of this controversy is not easy. German administrative procedure law is based on the principle of full agency review of the prerequisites for an authorization, unless a statute prescribes another standard. However, this seems exactly to be the case under the act, insofar as section 8 [3] only requires the applicant to demonstrate the fulfilment of certain authorization prerequisites, especially those that involve scientific judgement or a prediction of future behaviour. Article 20a Federal Constitution protects animal welfare only subject to legislation. In a more recent law relating to stem cell research, the legislature has expressly provided for a mere plausibility control. There is no cogent reason to reinterpret the Animal Protection Act in the light of the Constitution. The law also mandates the nomination of one or more officers for animal protection in all facilities where animal trials on vertebrates are performed (section 8b [1], [2]). The officer for animal protection is obliged to pay attention to compliance, advise staff responsible for performing animal trials and keeping trial animals, comment on applications for the authorization of such trials, and promote the introduction of non-animal trial methods (section 8b [3]). The establishment of internal ethical commissions is not prescribed, except for public research facilities such as universities where state law or internal regulations provide that such commissions must be established. Ethical review is, in principle, considered a matter of administrative control rather than self-regulation. Section 15 [1] subparagraphs 2, 3 provide for the establishment of animal protection commissions inside the administration, whose task is to advise the state agencies on decisions on applications for authorizations. Apart from requirements as to qualification of the members of these commissions, the law mandates a fairly high representation of animal protection interests.",

The same is true where, in the offspring for genetic causes, behavioural disturbances occur that are associated with suffering. In these cases, the competent authority can order sterilization of the animals. In pharming, these prohibitions may become relevant, especially with respect to the propagation of the donor animal. ) follows the definition given by the convention. At the core of the act, as part of the prescribed authorization procedure, is a cost-benefit analysis whereby the competent authorities, when deciding whether and on what terms to authorize the project, weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefits likely to accrue as a result of the programme (section 5 [4]). Furthermore, the 3-R concept is laid down in the law. An animal trial is only permissible where its purpose cannot be achieved satisfactorily by other reasonably practicable methods not entailing animal trials (section 5 [5] [a]). In performing the trial a method must be employed that uses minimum numbers of animals and uses vertebrates with the lowest degree of neuro-physiological sensitivity, causes the least pain, distress or lasting harm and is most likely to produce satisfactory results (section 5",

The restrictions on animal trials as described are prerequisites for granting the authorization for a project, and must be dealt with in the documentation accompanying the application. The burden of proffering evidence is described by the Home Office Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 2000 82 as the need for the applicant to \"demonstrate\" fulfilment of the permit requirements. As in Germany, this means that the applicant must provide substantiated and plausible information to support the application. In making the decision on the application, the competent authority, the British Home Office and its Inspectorate, has a wide margin of discretion. According to the British practice, not only the cost-benefit evaluation but also the application of the 3-R concept entails a weighing of conflicting concerns. The transparency of the weighing process and the predictability of its outcome have been criticized as being low. 83 The guidance document 84 interprets the cost-benefit analysis as an optimization process, whereby the benefits must be maximized and the (social or external) costs minimized. The likely benefit is derived from the utility of the data or products to result from the programme of work. It relates to the progress likely to result directly from the programme. The guidelines do not give any indication that efficiency of the end production could be a relevant beneficial factor. Rather, in relation to safety testing, they specifically rule out that the utility or benefit of the end product could be taken into consideration. However, it is difficult to see how the utility of the data generated can be assessed if one ignores the benefits to be derived from 81 their use. Moreover, it is not clear whether the objective of creating a transgenic animal would be questioned at all, or constitutes the frame within which the cost-benefit evaluation operates. Consequently, the application of the British law on animal trials is confronted with the same kind of problem addressed in the context of German law. This means that, in principle, savings of individual costs at the level of the firm do not justify an animal trial, 85 and even cost savings within the social insurance system may be irrelevant.",

This procedure is not set forth by law. Rather, it has been introduced as a standard condition under section 10 [1] of the act. All operators that carry out animal trials must establish an ethical review committee, which may be composed of staff members but normally contains outsiders. The objective of the ethical review process is to provide ethical advice to the operator, promote the use of ethical analysis, increase awareness of animal welfare issues and develop initiatives for the widest possible application of the 3-R concept. 87 This includes the encouragement of nonanimal alternatives for a projected license and consideration of the care and accommodation standards for trial animals. In practice, the ethical review process has developed into the second core element of animal protection in the field of research and development. 85 In contrast to Germany, the United Kingdom relies somewhat less on administrative regulation. While ethical review is a part of the authorization procedure in Germany, it is based on self-regulation in the United Kingdom. However, in assessing the differences between the two countries, one must also consider that the cost-benefit analysis prescribed in the United Kingdom is part of what German law understands by an ethical review process. In a way, cost-benefit analysis and ethical review overlap, which has been criticized. 88 By and large, the actual authorization practice seems to be strict and rather bureaucratic. In particular, the 3-R concept is pursuedstrictly. 89 Whether the often made claim, that the United Kingdom has the most stringent system of animal protection in the world, 90 is justified could only be verified by an empirical investigation.",

This interpretation is confirmed by the notification requirements set out in annex IIIA that applies to animals. The applicant must, among others, include in the risk assessment effects on human health resulting from direct or indirect contact of persons working with the GMOs (annex II D.1 point 6) and provide information aboutworkers' protection measures to be takenduringthe release (annex IIIA point III A 8). As regards higher plants, the risk assessment also comprises occupational health (annex II D.2 point 6), while the applicableannex IIIBdoesnot requiresupplying informationonoccupational safety andh ealth.

On the other hand, ethical considerations play a role in deciding whether the development product can be subjected to clinical testing. The product must have a sufficient degree of biosafety and the testing operations must comply with good clinical practice (GCP). The commencement of clinical testing requires an authorization (article 9 [4] and [7] Directive 2001/20). This is granted, after consultation of a regional or national ethics committee, under national law by the central authorities of the member states that are responsible for pharmaceutical safety. Similar requirements apply in the United States. With respect to pharming development, the regulatory problem is not the protection of the environment against risks associated with the release of GMOs, but rather the protection of the production process and the product against risks originating from the environment, such as infectious and viral agents that may spread to the production premises from the outside. This is especially true of animal pharming. However, the required safety measures are not necessarily such that options for development operations that are available under GMO regulation, especially an open release or even a contained use for class 1 GMOs with double fencing, cannot be used in practice. They affect more the safety and control measures to be taken regarding the gaining and processing of the crude bulk material and the manufacturing of the developmental preparation.",

However, recital 14 of the regulation refers to a risk-benefit evaluation. Moreover, arguments based on consistency militate for such an interpretation. The parallel Directive 2001/83 which regulates the decentralized procedure for medicinal products for human use 107 expressly provides for a risk-benefit evaluation (article 1 Nos. 1, 28a, article 26 [1] [a]). It would be odd that pharmaceuticals should be treated differently depending on the attribution of competences either to the member state authorities or the Commission. Finally, even more cogently, the requirement of a risk-benefit evaluation must be derived from article 16 [2] subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the regulation. This provision sets forth obligations of the holder of the authorization to provide information with respect to new knowledge that might influence the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the product.

This is also true of the consideration of therapeutic value, which does not allow a comparison with products that are already on the market. The only legal basis for such an analysis would be the discretion afforded the Commission by article 12 of the regulation. However, this discretion must be exercised in coping with the objectives of article 12, which does not indicate that beyond quality, safety and effectiveness other factors, such as the need for the medicinal product, could be relevant. The rejection of a need analysis under existing law also concerns the production method. The Commission cannot deny an application for a marketing authorization for a pharming product because it feels that, in view of existing conventional production alternatives, there is no need for such products.

This mainly concerns manufacturing methods, control methods and results of physical-chemical, biological or microbiological, toxicological, pharmaceutical, and clinical testing. Moreover, the application must contain information about, and an assessment of, potential environmental risks associated with the use of the medicinal product (article 8 [3] [ca] and [g] Directive 2004/27). However, environmental effects are not considered in the risk-benefit analysis (recital 28 Directive 2004/27); they can only give rise to conditions for using the product. 110 Directive 2003/63 contains modifications to the dossier which accompanies applications for various categories of biological pharmaceuticals such as human vaccines, insulin, herbal pharmaceuticals and gene therapeu-tics. Moreover, it generally regulates the requisite information on biological pharmaceuticals which are essentially equal to medicinal products already authorized (biogenerics) by reducing the dossier requirements (annex I part 1). However, medicinal products generated by pharming cannot be considered as essentially equal to conventional medicinal biologics already authorized since equivalence is defined both by product and process (article 10 [1] [a] [ii] Directive 2001/83). 111 Genetic modification constitutes a new process and therefore the applicant cannot claim any procedural alleviations. 112 Of course, equivalence may be established in appropriate cases between existing and new transgenic pharmaceuticals. 113 Whether the normal authorization prerequisites and procedures adequately respond to the specific problems presented by pharming drugs may be questioned. The genetic modification of the relevant animals, especially the generation of recombinant protein, as such is tackled practically by purification of the crude bulk material. However, the generation of transgenic animals may lead to instability of the gene construct and alterations in the metabolism of these animals; the recombinant protein may have impurities and be contaminated with host cell contaminants and infectious viruses. An example in this respect is presented by the authorization procedure relating to the transgenic drug ATryn \u00ae , which was concluded in August 2006 with a positive decision. 114 In this case, concerns were raised that altered glycosylation patterns in recombinant proteins produced from animals could alter pharmaceutical properties and that there was a potential of immunogenicity. However, it would seem that such problems can, as this first case of a regulatory procedure relating to a pharming drug shows, be addressed in the normal authorization procedure.",

In this respect, besides Directive 2001/83, as amended by Directive 2004/27, Directive 2001/20 and implementing national laws apply. 115 Although fundamental differences between conventional and pharming drugs do not exist with respect to safety, certain problems have been identified in the literature that are specific to animal pharming, such as the risk of There are various guidelines issued by EMEA in this field. 117 The stability of the gene construct, the purity of the recombinant protein, as well as theh omogeneity of thea ctives ubstance areimportant factorsin the quality assessment. Various guidelines issued by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and EMEA guidelines are applicable in this area. The stability of the gene construct must be investigated and demonstrated over several generations; variation must be within an acceptable limit. As regardspurity, EMEA requires in particular sterilityofthe product. The producer must demonstrate the absence of non-viral and viral adventitious agents as well as TransmissibleSpongioform Encephalopathy (TSE). He/she must also ensure the removal of unnecessary source protein and DNA. In the case of continuous production, the homogeneity of the active substance must be ensuredtoasufficientdegree. EMEA,inprinciple,requiresinthisrespect batch-to-batch consistency 118 whichi sdifficult to achieveindrugm anufacture based on animals, especially in the case of antibodies. The producer must also be able to detect quality failures during the whole production process. The head of pharmaceutical production is obliged to comply with the requirements and principles of good manufacturing practice for pharmaceuticals established under Community law, including GMP and GAP guidelines (articles46[ f],4 7Directive 2001/83).There arevarious guidelines on GMP andGAP of international origin suchasICH andWHO guidelines whichthe EC has partly incorporated into its own guidelines (Directive 2005/62). 119 The general regulatory problem in this respect, especially in animal pharming, is the assurance of product consistency and protection of the production process and the product against risks originating from the environment, such as infectious and viral agents and TSE that may spread by intrusion of animals into the production premises from the outside. EMEA guidance is urgently needed regarding this matter. The required measures are not necessarily such that options for cost efficient mass production available under GMO regulation, especially keeping the production herd outside with double fencing or cultivation of transgenic plants in open fields, cannot be used in practice. There may be particular cases of highly vulnerable production animals or plants, or perhaps also very risky uses of the end product, where biosecure facilities may be needed already with respect to the keeping of the production herd and the cultivation of the transgenic plants. 120 However, it would seem that normally the operator can also put the emphasis on safety and control measures relating to the gaining and processing of the crude bulk material and the manufacturing of the preparation. 121 What counts is that the medicinal protein is within the defined range and free of non-viral and viral pathogens and TSE.",

Although pharmaceuticals derived by recombinant DNA technology may be associated with specific quality and safety problems, these problems have already been addressed in the authorization procedure. The possibility of unexpected health effects is not greater than with any other animal-based production method, which under present law does not need to be labelled. On the other hand, arguments of consumer sovereignty and patient autonomy, as well as regulatory consistency, militate in favour of information about the transgenic production method. In this respect, a real difference between food and feed, where labelling is required, on the one hand, and pharmaceuticals, where it is not, on the other, does not exist. The interposition of medical doctors as proxies does not justify a differentiation; for complex issues it is common to rely on information agents such as medical doctors and address information to them although the need for information is determined from the perspective of the ultimate beneficiary. In order to avoid overregulation and gain experience with extended labelling, one should begin with a voluntary system whereby special labelling is permissible. In addition, one should introduce an individual right of access to information about the production method at the patient's request. 124 Lorenz 2006:171. 125 See as to the fundamental issues in the general context of labelling transgenic food Cranor 2007:201-221; McGarity 2007:128-150; Streiffer and Rubel 2007:63-87, who are in favour of labelling, and Markie 2007:88-105; Peters and Lambert 2007:151-177; Wolf 2007 :178-200, who are against (all in Weirich 2007 . 128 The institutional arrangements in the field of evaluation and authorization of medicinal products manufactured by pharming do not show major particularities.

However, as far as production without containment is concerned, it is unclear which regime of Directive 2001/18 governs the production process. Both the regime concerning releases (part B) and placing on the market (part C) have to be considered. Directive 2001/18 in its recitals seems to reserve the release regime to development releases (recitals 23, 25). Likewise, article 6 [2] Regulation 726/2004 with respect to pharmaceuticals that contain, or consist of, GMOs only refers to such activities. 130 One could conclude -and this seems to be the common understanding of the release regime -that releases that engender ongoing production activities are not covered by it. Although the notion of release as defined in Directive 2001/18 does not contain this restriction -release is any introduction into the environment unless it entails making the GMO available to third persons -this interpretation is suggested by the express provision of article 6 [9] of Directive 2001/18. 131 According to this provision, material derived from GMOs which are deliberately released in accordance with part B may only be placed on the market if authorized by a part C permit. The directive does not require this material to contain GMOs. As a matter of policy, the regime relating to the placing on the market also appears to be more appropriate because, beyond the marketing in the strict sense, it includes the permanent and wide-spread cultivation of transgenic crops and keeping and propagation of transgenic animals (see articles 19 [3] [c], 20, 23 [1] Directive 2001/18).

In pharming, the material derived from the release as such is not transgenic and the placing on the market of the pharmaceutical is already covered by the authorization granted under Regulation 726/2004. If one justifies the part C regime attached to the placing on the market by a resulting greater access of releases to the environment, one has also to underline that in pharming the impact of the release remains locally limited. The wording of some national laws relating to marketing is limited to the placing on the market of material that contains, or consists of, GMOs, 132 so that these laws would need to be interpreted extensively or amended. Finally, both article 12 [2] Directive 2001/18 and article 6 [2] Regulation 726/2004 declare the entire marketing regime to be inapplicable to the marketing of pharmaceuticals containing, or consisting of, GMOs where an authorization has been secured under Regulation 726/2004. It is doubtful whether it would make sense to apply it to the cultivation of the transgenic plants or the keeping of transgenic animals that, as such, are not made available to third persons. 133 Nevertheless, the better arguments militate for the proposition that the whole production process, where it occurs in an open system, needs to be performed under a marketing authorization. The authorization granted under article 6 [2] Regulation 726/2004 must be based on the environmental risk assessment of the release and therefore also covers the GMO-specific aspects of the production process. This is not true of the authorization for pharmaceuticals that are simply derived by recombinant DNA technology without containing, or consisting of, GMOs.

Therefore, there are no strong arguments that militate for exclusive reliance on the part C regime under Directive 2001/18. 134 However, it should be underlined that the existing framework conditions for the pharming production process are very complex and unclear. The interplay between the horizontal concept underlying Directive 2001/18 and the sectoral concept of the regulation of pharmaceuticals is not well defined. 135 This creates legal uncertainties that may hamper innovation and entail unnecessary transaction costs, and in the worst case may cause regulatory gaps. The operator has a legitimate interest in legal certainty and protection of his/her investment. For the future, a clarification in Regulation 126/2004 appears desirable.",

In view of the experience gained with the preceding releases, taking safety measures is no longer a permit prerequisite but can be imposed as a condition. The fact that the geographic scale might be larger does not normally play a particular role regarding pharming activities. Therefore, the operator who had developed the transgenic pharmaceutical under the release regime can largely rely on the documentation provided in the preceding release authorization procedure, and add information about experience gained so far (see article 13 [2] subparagraph 2, [3] Directive 2001/18). A major substantive difference to the release regime is the requirement of post-marketing monitoring, which is designed to detect unexpected adverse effects presented by the ongoing cultivation of transgenic plants and keeping and breeding of transgenic animals (arti-135 cle 20 [1] of the directive and implementing national law). 138 Given the relatively small geographic scale of pharming production activities, compliance with this requirement is not overly burdensome.

Under article 15 [2] Directive 2001/18, the competent national authority has exclusive competence for denying an application for placing on the market, although all other member states and the Commission must be given an opportunity to discuss outstanding issues. Where the national authority intends to grant the authorization, it can only decide on it in the absence of a reasoned objection by another member state or the Commission; otherwise the decision on the pending application is elevated to Community level. The Commission or eventually the Council decides on the application in the regulatory procedure (articles 15 [3], 18 of the directive). Under article 28 [1] of the directive EFSA is involved in the preparation of the decision; the obligations of cooperation with expert bodies of member states, established by articles 28-30 Regulation 178/2002, apply. In view of the usual lack of consensus or at least a sufficient majority on GMO issues among the member states, the Commission and EFSA occupy a key position. Specific guidelines for the risk assessment of GMOs used as production platforms for pharmaceuticals do not exist. However, EFSA is preparing guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants used for non-food or non-feed purposes (PPP guidance). 139 Directive 2001/18 provides for some form of public participation in the centralised procedure, more specifically in the preliminary procedure. Under article 24 [1[of the directive, the Commission must make available to the public summaries of the dossier submitted by the applicant, as well as positive national assessment reports. There is an opportunity to make comments to the Commission. Once the central regulatory procedure has commenced, there are no further opportunities to participate in the preparation of the decision. However, the high degree of politicization of GMO policy may result in extended possibilities of the public to indirectly influence the decision through pressure exerted on national governments represented in the regulatory committee. As regards access to information, under Regulation 1049 (as amended by Regulation 1367 There is widespread criticism of the technocratic performance of EFSA's advisory functions. In particular, it has been claimed that EFSA does not adequately consider inputs from national governments and that expert bodies are generally biased in favour of GMOs. In response to this criticism, EFSA has tried to strengthen relationships with member states. It has referred to its rules on scientific independence which include the requirement for panel members to declare conflicts of interest. Finally, EFSA has developed a policy of openness and transparency, whereby the summaries of the GMO applications and all EFSA opinions are published and made available on the EFSA website. 140 In EU practice, due to the high degree of politicization of GMO issues, central decision-making on the marketing of GMOs has become the rule. However, the geographic scale of pharming production operations is normallysmall,althoughtheir environmentaleffects will extend beyond the area of cultivation, andthe resultingproductsdonot contain, or consist of, GMOs. Therefore, it may be expected that objections by other member states or theCommissionwill be less frequentand limitedtocases where the experimental release had already been controversial or production will occur on several sites. This may give more room for decisions being takenb ythe national authorities. Thes trategic interests of theCommission in favour of centralized decision-making may be a counterbalancing factor.",

As already stated, whenever GMOs are introduced into the environment, spread beyond the place or area where they are handled cannot be ruled out. The safety measures that already need to be taken in order to manage potential risks to human health and the environment, including the agricultural environment, also provide a shield of protection against socio-economic harm. Nevertheless, plant pharming may lead to some out-crossing through pollen drift and other spread of GMOs into fields with traditional or organic crops and adversely affect these crops or the seeds derived from them. Moreover, although the transgenic plants used in pharming are not designed as feed, and therefore the risk of commingling appears to be low, it cannot be entirely ruled out. For example, commingling can occur in the harvesting process when the same harvesting machines are used. As a consequence of \"genetic contamination\" caused on these pathways, conventional and especially organic farmers may suffer economic losses due to applicable mandatory or voluntary labelling requirements (for example the loss of GM-free or organic status). They may incur increased costs when they have to take technical measures to prevent and monitor adventitious admixtures. In the case of pharmaceutical properties, marketability of crops may be totally threatened because consumers and manufacturers alerted about \"genetic contamination\" may refuse to buy the products. The policy of securing compatibility between GM cultivation and conventional and organic cultivation is denoted as coexistence. As spelt out, for instance, in section 1 No. 2 of the German Act, the purpose of the laws and regulations on coexistence is to ensure that products, in particular food and feed, can be produced conventionally, organically or by use of geneticallymodifiedorganisms andplacedonthe market.The structure of the laws is quite different.

However, not all member states that possess coexistence regulation have established safety distances. Although the setting of safety distances is normally justified with scientific findings, the figures show a great degree of national variation which cannot be simply explained by differences in climatic conditions and agricultural practices. 144 The Commission 145 voices some concern about the more stringent segregation distances introduced or proposed by some member states on the grounds of proportionality.

In the cultivation and other handling of plants, these requirements are deemed to be complied with by observing the rules of good professional practice.

The products need to be labelled as containing GMOs (because the labelling thresholds are exceeded) or the products can no longer be labelled in the way that they could according to the legal provisionsa pplicablet ot he production method (for examplea so rganic or GMO-free). The wording of section 36a of the German Act militates for the proposition that this does not only cover mandatory labelling under Regulation 834/2007 on ecological/biological products but also voluntary labelling according to the more stringent rules of associations of organic food growers. 157 The market-based definition of substantiality, although hardly compatible with the use-related original system of the Civil Code, provides conventional and organic farmers a higher degree of protection because they do not need to tolerate interventions caused by transgenic cultivation per se on the grounds that the mere presence of GMOs is not substantial. However, conventional, organic and transgenic farming are all declared to be customary methods of cultivation under local relevant circumstances. Thereby, a defence against the introduction of transgenic crops predicated on priority is made impossible. 158 In essence, the problem is shifted to reasonableness analysis and linked to compliance with the rules of good professional practice. Under section 906 [2] Civil Code, a substantial interference, although it is customary, can be enjoined where it could be prevented or mitigated by protective measures that are economically reasonable. Section 36a Act on Biotechnology declares measures for compliance with good professional practice to always be reasonable. Non-compliance with such rules can therefore lead to an injunction of transgenic agriculture. Nevertheless, compliance does not automatically dispense the transgenic farmer from the obligation to pay compensation. Section 906 [2] Civil Code accords a neighbour, who must tolerate an intervention because protective measures would be unreasonable, financial compensation where the customary use of his/her land or the revenue derived from it is impaired beyond a tolerable degree. Moreover, this liability for compensation also lies in the case of contributory causation. Under the circumstances where several neighbours could have caused the harm and it cannot be determined which neighbour has actually caused it, all relevant neighbours are severally and jointly liable, unless a particular neighbour can prove that he/she only caused part of the damage and estimation of the share is possible.",

Apart from criticism based on systematic grounds, some authors 159 sustain that it accords organic farmers a preference, instead of ensuring coexistence, and therefore is not compatible with article 26a Directive 2001/18. However, in its report on the national implementation of this provision, 160 the Commission has abstained from challenging any liability rules. It is also argued that the new law violates the principle of proportionality, at least insofar as it protects self-chosen quality claims for organic products that are more stringent than Community regulation on organic farming. 161 However, in defence of the new liability rules one can state that they are justified in order to prevent a creeping \"genetic contamination\" and will foster cooperative arrangements between farmers and the establishment of GMO and GMO-free agricultural zones. 162 As regards plant pharming, it should be noted that the duty of care and the rules of good professional practice under section 16b of the German Act on Biotechnology also apply where it is not, or not only, coexistence that is concerned but rather human health or the environment, for example in cases of unforeseen effects. Moreover, due to its general preventive effects, liability under section 36a of the Act can at least indirectly contribute to avoiding potential adverse effects on human health and the environment under such circumstances.",

The scheme is funded by a levy charged on all GM farmers (section 12) 163 and administered by the Plant Directorate. Insofar as compensation is paid, claims for damages that the victim may have against the person responsible for his/her loss under private law are subrogated to the state. Compensation requires that, in the same growing season and within a specified area, a genetically modified crop of the same or a related variety has been grown and has crossbred with the crop of the victim. Administrative rules have fixed the relevant distances between the fields in a very restrictive manner, namely for maize at 300 meters, for beet at 75 meters and for potatoes at 30 meters. Moreover the GM crop must be identified in the crop of the farmer suffering the loss (section 9 [1] [i] and [i] ). This latter prerequisite does not mean that, in case of several potential sources, the victim has to identify the precise field from which gene spread has occurred. Rather, it suffices that the presence of transgenic material from a GM crop, grown in the perimeter fixed by the administrative rules, can be determined by analytical methods. Otherwise, securing compensation would be very difficult once transgenic agriculture becomes more common. Under a collective system of compensation funded by all transgenic farmers, the identification of the precise source of gene spread does not make sense. It would introduce into the collective compensation system an element that is geared to traditional individual liability. In the case of organic farming, compensation may be paid at the discretion of the authority independent of these limitations (the distance requirement and the obligation to identify the transgenic crop of origin) where adventitious admixtures of genetically modified seed occur in the farmer's seed for sowing (section 9 [4] ). In all other respects, conventional and organic farmers are treated equally.",
