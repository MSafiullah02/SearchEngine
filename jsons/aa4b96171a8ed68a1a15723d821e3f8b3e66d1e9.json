Nosocomial transmission of the virus affects not only patients but also HCWs, sometimes in large numbers. The spread of Sars-CoV-2 in hospital wards is one of the blind spots of this epidemic in the absence of a systematic screening survey among HCWs in the most affected areas. At present, tests are only indicated for symptomatic HCWs, with the result that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic forms are out of any control. Various international studies show that these inapparent forms are in the majority. These investigations are urgent for several reasons:",
