            "text": "Because LSECtin was originally reported as a liver and lymph node sinusoidal\u2010specific molecule,4 we decided to determine the identity of LSECtin\u2010expressing cells within hepatic tissue. The LSECtin\u2010specific ADS1 and ADS4 antisera stained cells with a dendritic\u2010like appearance within liver sinusoids, a morphology consistent with Kupffer cells (Fig. 2). Parallel analysis with myeloid cell\u2013specific and endothelial cell\u2013specific markers revealed that anti\u2010CD31 exclusively stained sinusoidal endothelial cells, whereas anti\u2010CD68 and anti\u2010PU.1 antibodies only marked intrasinusoidal Kupffer cells (Fig. 2). Comparison of the staining patterns revealed that LSECtin\u2010specific antisera recognized Kupffer cells as well as other cells lining the hepatic sinusoids (Fig. 2), suggesting that LSECtin can be found in both Kupffer cells and other cells in the sinusoid wall. The presence of LSECtin on CD68+ macrophages was also suggested upon analysis of human lymph node sections, where LSECtin staining differed from that of anti\u2010CD31 and anti\u2013factor VIII (endothelium\u2010specific) and resembled the tissue staining pattern yielded by a factor XIII\u2013specific antibody (macrophage/DC\u2010specific) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, LSECtin\u2010positive cells were preferentially observed in lymph node areas enriched in CD68+ macrophages (Fig. 3B\u2010C). Double\u2010labeling experiments confirmed the presence of LSECtin in CD68+ cells (Fig. 4), indicating the presence of LSECtin in Kupffer cells. Further support for the presence of LSECtin in Kupffer cells was obtained via RT\u2010PCR on RNA isolated from human hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, Ito cells, and Kupffer cells. LSECtin mRNA could be exclusively amplified from Kupffer RNA, which showed considerably higher levels of both CD68 and PU.1 transcripts than the other cell types (Fig. 4B). Therefore, immunohistochemistry on human liver sections and RT\u2010PCR on isolated hepatic cell types revealed that LSECtin is preferentially expressed by myeloid CD68+ PU.1+ Kupffer cells in the human liver.",

            "text": "The DC\u2010SIGN lectin is expressed in human myeloid cells, and its expression is regulated by PU.1,26 a member of the Ets family of transcription factors. The expression of LSECtin in myeloid cells5 and the similar pattern of staining yielded by anti\u2010LSECtin and anti\u2010PU.1 antibodies on human liver tissue (Fig. 2) suggest that PU.1 could participate in the restricted expression of LSECtin. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of three potential Ets\u2010binding sequences (TTCCTTCCTTCC) at position \u221266 within the LSECtin gene proximal regulatory region (Fig. 5A). In fact, alignment of the corresponding proximal regulatory regions of the human, murine, and rat LSECtin genes evidenced that this putative Ets\u2010binding sequence is highly conserved (Fig. 5A). Evaluation of the activity of the LSECtin gene proximal regulatory region revealed that three distinct constructs exhibit promoter activity well above the promoterless pXP2 plamid (Fig. 5B). More importantly, the activity of the three constructs was significantly higher in cells of myeloid origin and with the ability to express LSECtin (THP\u20101) than in erythroleukemic (K562) and T lymphoid cells (Jurkat), which do not express LSECtin (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the proximal regulatory region of the LSECtin promoter preferentially functions within a myeloid context, providing a molecular explanation for the presence of the lectin in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. The relevance of the \u221266 putative Ets\u2010binding element in LSECtin promoter activity was evaluated after mutation of the three putative Ets cognate sequences in the context of the pCLEC4G \u2212296Luc construct. As shown in Fig. 5C, pCLEC4G\u2010296/\u201066MUTLuc construct exhibited significantly lower activity in the THP\u20101 myeloid cell line than the wild\u2010type pCLEC4G \u2212296Luc construct (P < 10\u22124), while mutation of the putative Ets\u2010binding site at \u221299 did not affect LSECtin proximal promoter activity (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that the preferential activity of the LSECtin gene regulatory region in myeloid cells is partly dependent on the integrity of the sequence around \u221266, which includes three potential binding sites for Ets family members.",

            "text": "Next, because PU.1 is a myeloid\u2010restricted Ets transcription factor, we evaluated its ability to modulate the function of the LSECtin proximal promoter. In agreement with its preferential activity in myeloid cells, both Myb and RUNX3 transactivated the LSECtin regulatory region in a nonhematopoietic cellular context (Fig. 6A). More importantly, PU.1 overexpression enhanced the LSECtin promoter activity in the presence of RUNX3 (Fig. 6A), although it reduced the transactivation ability of c\u2010Myb (Fig. 6A). Therefore, PU.1 positively modulates the LSECtin promoter activity in the presence of transcription factors which, like RUNX3, are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. The positive regulatory action of PU.1 on the LSECtin promoter was mainly exerted via the \u221266 Ets element, because its mutation reduced RUNX3/PU.1 transactivation by more than 50% (Fig. 6B). Considering the above results, we decided to determine whether the LSECtin regulatory region was actually occupied by PU.1 in vivo. To that end, genomic DNA from LSECtin+ MDDCs was subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti\u2010PU.1 polyclonal antiserum. The LSECtin promoter was readily amplified in the anti\u2010PU.1\u2013precipitated DNA, whereas no amplification was detected in the DNA brought down by a control antibody or in the absence of antibody (Fig. 6C). The presence of two distinct bands derived from the LSECtin promoter (Fig. 6C) is explained by the presence of a direct repeat within the LSECtin proximal regulatory region (Fig. 5A). Therefore, LSECtin expression correlates with that of the PU.1 transcription factor, which binds to and enhances the activity of the LSECtin proximal regulatory region in LSECtin\u2010expressing cells of myeloid origin.",

The myeloid expression of LSECtin allows the definition of a chromosome 19 cluster of lectin\u2010encoding genes (CD23, DC\u2010SIGN, and LSECtin) which mediate antigen capture for subsequent presentation during immune responses. The presence of DC\u2010SIGN30, 31 and LSECtin (this study) on human Kupffer cells indicates that at least two members of this gene cluster are actively involved in scavenging and antigen capture by liver myeloid cells, and might therefore contribute to the establishment of the peripheral tolerance. As in the case of DEC\u201020532 and DC\u2010SIGN,33 the generation of LSECtin\u2010specific reagent will be a very useful tool to evaluate its potential role as a tolerance\u2010promoting capturing receptor. On the other hand, the pattern of expression of DC\u2010SIGN and LSECtin, together with the presence of DC\u2010SIGNR on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells,3, 17 provides support for a role of this family of C\u2010type lectins in the scavenging function of the liver. Such a function can be inferred from a large list of pathogenic and endogenous ligands of DC\u2010SIGN33 and by the restricted sugar specificity of LSECtin.18\n",

The ability of LSECtin to interact with virally encoded molecules and glycoproteins with truncated complex and hybrid N\u2010linked glycans18 suggests its role as a scavenging molecule. Moreover, biochemical studies using recombinant LSECtin indicates its ability to specifically interact with serum proteins (data not shown). On the other hand, and by analogy with DC\u2010SIGN,34 LSECtin could be also implicated in cell\u2013cell adhesion. If so, LSECtin might participate in either attachment of Kupffer cells to liver sinusoidal cells or in Kupffer cell interactions with Ito cells, a process that has proven relevant during liver tissue injury and repair.35, 36\n",

The immunochemical colocalization of CD68 and LSECtin in Kupffer cells is compatible with the PU.1 dependency of the LSECtin expression, since PU.1 is expressed by Kupffer cells,37 which are characterized by the expression of the PU.1\u2010dependent CD68 gene.38, 39 However, immunohistochemistry also revealed the existence of LSECtin\u2010expressing cells that were devoid of CD68. Therefore, and based on data from previous reports, it is possible that LSECtin can be expressed by myeloid (Kupffer) and nonmyeloid (sinusoidal endothelial) cells. A similar conclusion has been reached for a number of scavenger and lectin receptors expressed on human lymph node sinuses.40 Along this line, the mannose receptor, whose expression in myeloid cells is PU.1\u2010dependent,41 is expressed on both liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells,42 and its absence from myeloid cells appears to trigger a compensatory enhancement of its expression on liver sinusoidal cells.43 Therefore, the expression of LSECtin on two distinct liver cell types might be indicative that its sugar\u2010binding specificity and internalization capability contributes to both arms of the innate response: scavenging and antigen\u2010presentation.",

We have previously demonstrated that the activity of the DC\u2010SIGN promoter is regulated by the myeloid\u2010specific transcription factor PU.1, whose level of expression is critically dependent on the presence of IL\u20104.26 The present study demonstrates that PU.1 is also involved in the expression of LSECtin, since (1) PU.1 is constitutively bound to the LSECtin proximal promoter in vivo; (2) PU.1 potentiates the activity of the LSECtin regulatory region; and (3) PU.1 down\u2010modulation translates into diminished levels of LSECtin mRNA in leukemic and primary LSECtin+ cells. Although induced by IL\u20104,7 the participation of PU.1 in the expression of CD23 has not been reported, but it is tempting to hypothesize that PU.1 might also regulate CD23 expression, especially considering their overlapping patterns of expression. If this is the case, PU.1 would become an essential component for the expression of the three antigen\u2010capturing and pathogen\u2010attachment lectins encoded within the chromosome 19p13.2 gene cluster.",

It is therefore possible that a threshold level of PU.1 is required for both lectins to be expressed, and that IL\u20104 might induce their expression primarily through an increase in PU.1 expression. Alternatively, IL\u20104 might activate a signaling pathway/transcription factor that ultimately synergizes with PU.1 for the induction of both lectins. An obvious potential candidate would be STAT6, which functionally collaborates with PU.1, appears to bind to the CD23 gene regulatory region, and whose transcriptional activity is induced by IL\u20104.44 However, no obvious STAT6\u2010binding sequences are located within the LSECtin proximal regulatory region, and STAT6 does not influence the activity of the DC\u2010SIGN promoter in spite of the presence of three elements with STAT6\u2010binding ability in vitro (data not shown). A second potential factor that might participate in the IL\u20104 inducibility of LSECtin expression is peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), whose activity and expression is controlled by IL\u20104.45 In fact, PPAR\u03b3 expression is currently considered as a hallmark for the alternative activation of macrophages,46, 47 which results in the induction of both LSECtin5 and DC\u2010SIGN.10 However, the synthetic PPAR\u03b3 ligand GW7845, or the PPAR antagonist inhibitor GW9662, did not modify the basal or inducible expression of either LSECtin or DC\u2010SIGN (data not shown), thus arguing against a role for PPAR\u03b3 in the control of the expression of both lectins.",

To confirm siRNA efficiency in each individual experiment, one\u2010third of the cells were lysed and underwent western blotting (inserts), using a polyclonal antiserum against human PU.1 and a \u03b2\u2010actin\u2013specific monoclonal antibody for loading control purposes.",
