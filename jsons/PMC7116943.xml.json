            "text": "Currently there are roughly 7 million cases of reported infectious diseases in China, which result in approximately 17,000 deaths annually (National Health and Family Planning Commission of the PRC, 2016). Previous studies have found the incidence of infectious diseases has been sharply reduced due to great improvements in health care services (Hipgrave, 2011). However, the emergence and re-emergence of some climate-sensitive diseases, such as malaria, dengue and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have occurred in recent decades in China (Huang et al., 2012; Xiang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010b). Malaria was a serious public health problem during the 1970s with an incidence of approximately 2800 per 100,000 population (Yin et al., 2014). In 2001, the incidence was only 2 per 100,000 with about 20,000 cases reported (Yin et al., 2014). However, malaria cases in China increased to 64,178 in 2006 (Zhou et al., 2007). Moreover, no dengue cases were reported prior to 1977, but frequent outbreaks have occurred during the last few decades in China (Lai et al., 2015). HFRS, a serious zoonotic disease caused by hantaviruses, can be transmitted to humans by contact with infected rodents or their excreta (Hansen et al., 2015). The disease is frequently reported in China where roughly 90% of the world's cases occur (Xiao et al., 2014). Although the incidence of HFRS significantly declined during the 1990s, there has been an increasing trend since 2008 (Xiao et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). The possible reasons for the emergence and re-emergence of these infectious diseases may be linked to climate change, population movement, rapid urbanization and increased surveillance efforts (Tong et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016).",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that the global average surface temperature will increase by 1.0\u20133.7 \u00b0C by 2081\u20132100 compared to 1986\u20132005, and other climatic variations, such as changes in rainfall patterns and relative humidity will also occur (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Climate change has, and will continue to, impact the transmission of vector and rodent-borne diseases by affecting the growth and development of the vectors or hosts, shortening the incubation period of the pathogens within the vectors, and impacting human behaviour (e.g. more time spent outdoors) (World Health Organization, 2012). The projected temperature increase and change in rainfall patterns may bring about an increase in cases of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue and HFRS (Xiang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010a; Zhou et al., 2010). In China, annual average land surface air temperature has increased by 0.5\u20130.8 \u00b0C over the past 100 years, and is projected to increase by 2.3\u20133.3 \u00b0C by 2050 as compared to 2000 (China National Development and Reform Commission, 2007). Extreme climate events, such as extremes in temperature, drought in north China, and flooding in south China, may become more frequent and intensive (China National Development and Reform Commission, 2007). The variations in temperature, rainfall, humidity and extreme events posed by climate change could facilitate infectious disease transmission and result in the possible increase in cases of infectious diseases in China (Tong et al., 2015).",

In the clinical health system, hospitals provide patient diagnosis, treatment and management. In the public health system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) work to protect and improve public health and safety, and focus on disease prevention, control and surveillance; and cases of notifiable diseases are reported by clinical professionals to the local CDC (He, 2005). Therefore, hospital clinical staff and CDC public health professionals perform different roles, and may have different views on infectious disease control and prevention. Given that the ability of the public health system (i.e. CDCs) to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the context of climate change has been extensively studied (Tong et al., 2017a; b; Tong et al., 2016), a similar investigation of the clinical health system where diseases are diagnosed and treated, is warranted. This study will contribute to a better understanding of infectious disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control in the face of climate change in China, and may also benefit disease control in other countries (Tong et al., 2016).",

The majority of professionals, particularly nurses and those with longer terms of employment indicated that the weather was getting warmer. Nearly all respondents indicated climate change would adversely affect population health, and most indicated it would facilitate infectious disease transmission. Less than 10% of participants thought climate change was unlikely to be associated with malaria incidence compared to 12% for dengue and HFRS. The results were consistent with our previous studies among CDC staff who indicated climate change was more likely to have an influence on malaria than HFRS, whilst the perception of an association between climate change and dengue was not as strong as in a previous study conducted in Guangdong (Tong et al., 2016). This is likely due to Guangdong having the highest incidence of dengue in China, whilst in Anhui there are fewer dengue cases reported (Lai et al., 2015). Moreover, compared with previous studies among CDC public health professionals in other provinces (Tong et al., 2017a), the hospital clinical professionals in this study were more likely to indicate that climate change would have an influence on HFRS. This could be due to the relatively high number of HFRS cases in Anhui Province, and hence firsthand knowledge of the disease and its determinants. Additionally, another study conducted among health experts in Europe also indicated their perceptions of the negative impact of climate change on vector-borne, food-borne, water-borne and rodent-borne diseases (Semenza et al., 2012). Despite 94.2% of participants agreeing strongly or somewhat that hospitals were currently well prepared for the threat of a serious emerging disease, climate change may present new challenges for health sectors such as increased incidence in certain climate-sensitive diseases, or diseases either not previously seen in the area, or not seen for some time. Such an influx in cases could stretch the coping capabilities of the present system. This may explain why the public health and clinical health sectors share concerns about potential emerging and re-emerging climate-sensitive diseases.",

This is in line with other studies that indicated the impact of climate change and migration would affect infectious disease transmission (Gao et al., 2012; McMichael, 2015; Sang et al., 2015). Higher temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can contribute to the increasing population of vectors/rodents and more frequent contact with humans. Simultaneously, population movement can facilitate disease transmission from one region to another. In China, currently it is estimated that approximately 245 million people have migrated from poor rural areas to gain work in the cities (National Health and Family Planning Commission of the PRC, 2017). This \u201cfloating population\u201d (highly mobile population) of internal migrants chiefly work in insecure low-wage jobs. Moreover, they often lack health insurance and defer seeking timely medical treatment, which could have a negative influence on infectious disease control (Qin et al., 2014). Future infectious disease control and prevention should be cognizant of climate change impacts and population movements on the transmission of these diseases. In addition, building a more comprehensive national health insurance system covering the internal migrant population's health expenses in any part of China may provide benefits for population health (Qin et al., 2014).",

As Anhui historically has a high incidence of malaria and HFRS (Chen and Qiu, 1993; Gao et al., 2012), professionals are more likely to have experience and confidence in dealing with these diseases, whereas historically there has been a low incidence of dengue in the Province. The majority of professionals believed that their hospital laboratories were able to provide rapid diagnostic test results for malaria, dengue and HFRS. Additionally, most professionals purported they would take comprehensive actions if they detected an unusual cluster of cases. This indicates there is a strong likelihood that outbreaks of emerging or re-emerging diseases would be detected early by the clinical professionals or the CDC. This detection of unusual trends could aid in curbing transmission if preventive measures are activated early.",
