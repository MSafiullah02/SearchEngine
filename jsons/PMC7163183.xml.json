In addition, since pregnant women are at a high risk of developing pneumonia from viruses, such as the influenza virus, the risk of pregnant women contracting COVID-19 disease is even higher. The limited early data show that pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19\u2013induced pneumonia may be at a higher risk of being intubated and becoming critically ill (approximately 8%); experiencing complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth (41%), preeclampsia (14%), cesarean delivery (91%), and stillbirth (2.4%); being admitted to the intensive care unit (8%); and neonatal death (2.4%).2 Although no maternal deaths have been reported in the world so far (March 21, 2020), the first ones are happening even today. Pregnancy should be considered a comorbidity, and pregnant women at risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19 disease.",

Healthcare workers need utmost protection now. The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, such as surgical masks, N-95 masks, or equivalent masks, should be prioritized and provided by the federal government and individual states. At Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, it is now mandatory that all obstetrical healthcare workers coming in direct contact with patients wear PPE, in both the outpatient and the inpatient (eg, L&D) settings. Although other specialties can drastically decrease provider-patient in-person outpatient and even inpatient (eg, elective surgeries) interactions, the obstetrics group is a specialty (with surgical oncology being another exception) that cannot avoid these direct interpersonal interactions, as childbirth requires direct contact and cannot be postponed.",
