The April 6th report from the Center for Disease Control COVID-19 Response Team showed that children with underlying medical conditions represent 23% of the total pediatric COVID-19 cases and 77% of those hospitalized.1 In addition to this increased COVID-19 risk common to children with underlying medical conditions, those with congenital heart disease (CHD) are known to be at higher risk of secondary cardiovascular outcomes long-term.2\n,\n3 Physical activity is a modifiable risk factor that is particularly important for this high-risk population.4 The impact of public health measures on vulnerable populations, such as children with CHD, is important to quantify. The duration of the public health measures is unknown but may last for a year or more. Data about collateral health impacts are needed to help inform policy makers about the pros and cons of such measures as the epidemiology of COVID-19 evolves.",

BCCH is the only pediatric tertiary hospital for the province and almost all patients with CHD in BC are followed in one of these settings. Participants were provided a Fitbit Charge 2TM (Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, CA), and were asked to wear and sync the device regularly for 24 months. Wristband size and placement were in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. FitbitTM data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools hosted at BCCH.7\n,\n8 Fitbit data were auto-exported to REDCap using application programming interface.",

If this is possible, or could be with appropriate intervention, then long-term negative health impacts due to reduced physical activity could be avoided. From January through early March, 2019 and 2020 step-counts are similar and increasing. Later in March, 2020 step-counts are significantly lower than 2019, despite seasonal match between the cohorts. It appears that this reduction is driven by reduced weekday step-counts, likely reflecting COVID-19-related disruptions to parents\u2019 and children\u2019s routines (work, school, extracurricular activities). Week 14 step-counts, though still lower than 2019, suggest a slight increase in physical activity from the previous week, which may reflect expected spring increase in physical activity and/or adaptive measures taken by families as COVID-19 measures extend.17 The objective measurement of physical activity in this study provides the basis for future investigation of the long-term impacts of reduced physical activity during COVID-19 and how best to mitigate these. It will provide baseline data to investigate the necessity and effectiveness of supports for physical activity during and after the pandemic. This may provide an opportunity to assist children with CHD and their families in developing life-long physical activity habits that are less reliant on external factors (e.g. school, extracurricular physical activities), which are currently cancelled, but normally contribute to physical activity levels in school-aged children.18 Physical activity monitoring throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after will permit better understanding of the adaptability of children with CHD and their families, and may help generate and test hypotheses about individual and family based physical activity interventions.",

A key strength of this study is the longitudinal data capture enabled by using Fitbits and the comparison data from both 2019 and early 2020. The main limitation to the study is that we used a single method to quantify physical activity and as such it is limited to only physical activity patterns indicated by step-counts, which do not reflect physical activity mode or intensity. A second limitation is the lack of healthy control comparison data, which are unavailable due to the nature of the ongoing cohort study limited to children with CHD. Therefore, the generalizability of these data to healthy children may be limited.",
