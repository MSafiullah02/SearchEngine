As of March 14, 2020, the disease has caused 81026 infections in China, with a case fatality rate of 3.9% (3194/81026). A total of 55095 confirmed cases have been reported in other countries in the world, with a mortality rate of 4.1% (2238/55095), which is not much different from that in China. Although most patients present with mild symptoms and are not life-threatening, the number of deaths is still high due to the large population base.",

The SARS-CoV-2 bind to alveolar epithelial cells, then the virus activates innate immune system and adaptive immune system, resulting in the release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6. In addition, due to the role of these pro-inflammatory factors, vascular permeability increased, a large number of fluid and blood cells into the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea and even respiratory failure 8, 9, 10 (Figure 1\n).

IL-6R exists not only in transmembrane form, but also in soluble form. IL-6 binds to these two forms and then interacts with gp130 to trigger downstream signal transduction and gene expression 19, 20, 21. In the trans signal transduction pathway, the binding affinity of sIL-6R to IL-6 is similar to that of IL-6R, and this complex binds to gp130, which initiates intracellular signal transduction. In the classical signal pathway, many cells cannot respond to IL-6 signal because they do not express IL-6R, but some of these cells can be stimulated by sIL-6R-IL-6 complex to respond to IL-6 signal and cause cell signal transduction [22,23]. The trans presentation signal is suppressed by extracellular sgp130, and sgp130 can form a complex with sIL-6R to prevent sIL-6R from binding to membrane-bound gp130 [16]. The next step is to activate the JAK-STATA (STAT1, STAT3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT5) pathway 22, 23, 24, 25, in addition, RAS-RAF pathway [23,26], SRC-YAP-NOTCH pathway [27], and AKT-PI3K pathway [28,29] also being activated(Figure 3D).

The recommended dose of tocilizumab is 8mg / kg intravenous drip every 4 weeks, for adult with rheumatoid arthritis, which can be used in combination with methotrexate or other anti-rheumatic drugs. When liver enzyme abnormality, neutrophil count and platelet count decrease, the dose of tocilizumab can be reduced to 4mg/kg.

Among them, 1023 cases died, the crude death rate of unreported complications was 0.9%, and the mortality rate of patients with complications was much higher, 10.5% of patients with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% of patients with diabetes and 6.0% of patients with hypertension. There is some controversy about whether tocilizumab increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data from several randomized controlled trials (RCT) and real-world evidence (RWE) studies have been published. The Giles JT et al. study [49] included 3080 patients over 50 years old with more than one CVD risk factor for cardiovascular disease who met the diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis (1538 were treated with tocilizumab and 1542 were treated with etanercept). After an average follow-up of 3.2 years, 83 times of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in the tocilizumab group (5.4%), while 78 times of MACE occurred in the etanercept group (5.1%). The resulting hazard ratio (HR) was 1.05 (95%CI 0.77 - 1.43). The authors concluded that tocilizumab had a higher cardiovascular risk than etanercept. Interestingly, two RWE studies have come to a different conclusion from aforementioned RCT study. In the Kim SC et al. study [50], cardiovascular events in tocilizumab and Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors (TNFi) were compared, and after strict propensity score matching, 9218 tocilizumab and 18810 TNFi were included. The cardiovascular incidence rate of tocilizumab was 0.52 per/100 person-years, and TNFi was 0.59 per / 100 person-years. The combined HR is 0.84 (95% CI 0.56 - 1.26). Another RWE study of Xie FL et al. [51] came to a similar conclusion that there was no significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular events associated with the use of tocilizumab compared with TNFi (HR[Medicare database]=0.79,95%CI 0.65\u20130.96; HR[MarketScanned database]=0.84, 95% CI 0.52\u20131.37). Although the conclusion of RCT study was slightly different from RWE studies, the 95%CI of all studies is not significant (that is, it contains 1), so tocilizumab increases cardiovascular events was insufficient.",

A 7-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed a severe cytokine storm after CAR-T treatment, and the subsequent treatment with tocilizumab dramatically improved her condition and did not affect the efficacy of CAR-T [44]. Another report reported that a male patient with ALL developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) after treatment with blinatumomab. The patient developed severe respiratory failure and methemoglobinemia. The subsequent treatment with tocilizumab successfully saved the patient's life [53].",

All of them had high expression of IL-6. Currently, a small sample clinical trial in China (Clinical trial registration ID: ChiCTR2000029765) has shown good efficacy in tocilizumab [47]. All 21 patients in the group met the criteria for severe or critical COVID-19 [58]. Among them, the severe criteria meet one of the following: shortness of breath, respiratory rate more than 30 beats / min; oxygen saturation was less than 93%, while resting; PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 300 mmHg. Critical criteria meet one of the following: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; shock; and admission to ICU with other organ failure. After a few days of treatment, the fever patient's body temperature returned to normal (at the beginning, all 21 patients had a fever), and all other symptoms were significantly improved. 75% (15/20) of the patients reduced their oxygen intake, and one patient did not need oxygen. Imaging examination (CT scan) showed that 90.5% (19/21) of the patients had absorption of pulmonary lesions. Laboratory examination showed that the proportion of peripheral blood lymphocytes and C-reactive protein returned to normal. The deficiency is that only the level of IL-6 in peripheral blood before treatment with tocilizumab was reported (mean value 132.38 \u00b1 278.54 pg/ml), but the level of IL-6 after treatment was not reported.",
