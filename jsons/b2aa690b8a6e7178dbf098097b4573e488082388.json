Type 2 diabetes, the most common type of diabetes, is associated with a low grade chronic inflammation induced by the excessive visceral adipose tissue. This inflammatory status affects the homeostatic glucose regulation and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation can cause an abnormal and ineffective immune response. This complex and multifactorial pathway includes a decreased mobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, chemotaxis, and phagocytic activity, lower secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharides, inhibition of Tumor Necrosis Alpha (TNFa) activity by T-cells and glycation of immunoglobulin.",

            "text": "DPP4 enzyme is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed ubiquitously in many tissues, including the immune cells. Although its functions are not fully understood yet, DPP4 plays a major role in glucose and insulin metabolism. DPP4 degrades incretins such as glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, ultimately leading to reduced insulin secretion and abnormal visceral adipose tissue metabolism. DPP4 regulates postprandial glucose via degradation of GLP-1. DPP4 expression is higher in visceral adipose tissue and directly correlates with adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance. DPP4 plays also an important role in immune regulation by activating T cells and upregulating CD86 expression and NF-jB pathway. It can be summarized that DPP4 increases inflammation in type 2 diabetes via both catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms. Of note, the enzymatic activity of DPP4 causes the cleavage and may affect the function of several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors To better understand the mechanism of the interaction between DPP4 and coronavirus, transgenic mouse models were developed. In one study, mice were made susceptible https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108125 0168-8227/\u00d3 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Diabetic DPP4 H/M mice had a delay in the initiation of inflammation in the lung characterized by reduced CD4 + T cell recruitment. It was suggested that higher rate of mortality and complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes infected with MERS-CoV could be associated with a DPP4 mediated dysregulated immune response.",

DPP4 inhibitors can be divided in mimetics, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin and not peptide mimetics, alogliptin and linagliptin. DPP4 inhibitors target the enzymatic activity of DPP4 and consequently block the breakdown of GLP-1.

More recently, DPP4 inhibitors and mainly GLP-1 receptor analogs have shown to provide beneficial effects that go beyond their glucose lowering effects.",

A meta-analysis showed that upper respiratory tract infections does not increase significantly with DPP4 inhibitor treatment. When compared with placebo or active comparator treatment, risks of respiratory infection in for DPP4 inhibitors were all comparable [9] . Initiation of a DPP4 inhibitor was not associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infections, On the contrary, anti-inflammatory and anti-adipogenic, effects have been associated with the use of DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor analogs [10] . Reduced macrophage infiltration directly via GLP-1 dependent signaling and reduced insulin resistance and inflammation by regulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization have been described with DPP4 inhibition and GLP-1 activation. This brief overview wants to stimulate the discussion on the potential role of DPP4 in COVID-19-infected individuals with type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether DPP4 inhibition or modulation should be the most appropriate strategy. However, DPP4 may represent a potential target for preventing and reducing the risk and the progression of the acute respiratory complications that type 2 diabetes may add to the COVID-19 infection.",
