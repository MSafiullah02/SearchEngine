The key lesson is for healthcare workers to be vigilant and prepared to institute infection control measures should the need arise. Thus, education of health and support workers in infection control is vital. They should know current guidelines and be able to incorporate them into their usual work pattern. However, the continued high incidence of hospital-related infections indicates that, despite strong research evidence for changing practice, this may not occur for years due to lack of knowledge, expertise or equipment.1\n",
