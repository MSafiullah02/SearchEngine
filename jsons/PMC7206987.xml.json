Additional measures included limiting movement into and out of the shelter (e.g., by providing on-site showers), encouraging physical distancing, and making infection prevention and control recommendations. Response coordination required resource investment and collaboration between local health and community service departments, staff members at homeless shelter sites, community health care providers, and federal partners.",

Multiple testing and screening events were conducted to assess as many residents as possible. Second, these public health interventions were resource-intensive, which might not be sustainable long term. Third, symptom screening and testing were conducted independently of each other, which did not allow for simple linkage of symptom and test result information. Finally, the effectiveness of the interventions could not be assessed during the period of the investigation and response.",

Common methods to control COVID-19 spread (e.g., testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, and restricting movement) are difficult to implement among persons who are experiencing homelessness (5,6), and stay-at-home orders are impractical. CDC has published interim guidance for homeless service providers to plan and respond to COVID-19. CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident\u2019s heads are at least 6 feet apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1). Assistance with enforcement of shelter-in-place orders might be necessary for persons experiencing homelessness during spread of COVID-19. At shelters experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, transferring infected residents and those with underlying health conditions or of advanced age (7,8) into individual housing units should be prioritized.",
