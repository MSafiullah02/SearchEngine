In view of events, most of us had to make serious decisions, some of them with a lack of scientific evidence due to the circumstances and with the only objective of ensuring the safe care of our patients, reduce non-essential contacts and prevent possible maternal and fetal complications in future pregnancies.

At the same time, specific prevention and prophylaxis information started to be given to IVIRMA staff both in Italy and Spain for patients coming from these Italian areas. Since the situation in Italy did not improve, and in anticipation of a possible lock-down of the country (which occurred on March 9th), restrictive measures were expanded to any cycle of a patient coming from Italy to be performed in Spain. These restraints included the halt of most oocyte donation treatments and all embryo transferences from Italian patients, recommending a \u201cfreeze-all\u201d strategy and a later embryo transfer when the situation has normalized. Moreover, egg donation treatments were canceled, as oocytes or frozen embryos for later use.",

As our patient profile is healthy and asymptomatic and that CDC has not considered them as a potential focus of infection, we decided to continue with the ongoing cycles of patients with their own gametes until oocyte retrieval in order not to harm those couples who had already started an Assisted Reproduction treatment.",

As we can see, since the implementation of the first measures because of the pandemic, the decline has been progressive during the month of February followed by a pronounced drop in activity since March 10th, a date almost coinciding with the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain; on the other hand, and as we expected, the number of fertility preservation procedures increased gradually as the rest of treatments decreased, according to the recommendations established by the different scientific societies.

Due to the pandemic and the lack of awareness of its immediate consequences on reproduction, some scientific societies such as American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM, 2020) have classified certain Reproductive Medicine procedures as elective or non-urgent; this definition has generated a great controversy since it underestimates the importance of the time for some specific sectors of the population such as women with advanced maternal age and/or diminished ovaria reserve. In line with the position adopted by the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine-(SIFES-MR) (Vaiarelli et al., 2020) we think that limiting indefinitely the access to Assisted Reproduction treatments to these patients will certainly affect their chance to conceive once this outbreak ends.",

In this way, a precious time would not be lost to enhance the pregnancy opportunities of these women. In order to successfully develop this proposal, it is necessary to optimize the recovery of oocytes in a single retrieval and having facilities and qualified staff that guarantee the achievement of excellent results in vitrification and later thawing. Moreover, as established by FDA Statement on Feb 14th, while respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), the potential for transmission of COVID-19 by these means is unknown at this time. There have been no reported cases of transmission of COVID-19 via these products. Our rationale is that Assisted Reproduction treatments are not via contagion for respiratory viruses.",

Even with no specific data available, it is assumed that sperm, oocytes and embryos do not have receptor for Covid-19 and are unlikely to be infected (ESHRE, 2020).

What is known has, for the most part, been the results of epidemics resulting from two different diseases, SARS and MERS. The latest researches provide some insight into the clinical characteristics, pregnancy outcomes and vertical transmission potential of Covid-19 infection in pregnant women (Chen et al.,2020; Rasmussen et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020); despite the fact these publications include a small sample size, these findings are valuable for preventive and clinical practice . It remains to be seen during the current epidemic which factors modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal exposure by gestational age, the effects of medications or other treatment regimens, differences in host immune responses, occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions, and other covariables (Schwartz and Graham, 2020).",

According to WHO reports, the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2.9% (2247 in 76769); however, the mortality rate varied among studies.The differences in the results among different studies could be due to the study population, as well as the differences among the studies in terms of disease severity.
