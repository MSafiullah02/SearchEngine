It is important to emphasize that these results have only been demonstrated in Vero cells, and it is possible that infection and replication of the SARS-CoV gene 7 replacement virus may be altered on other cell lines. It is more likely that these proteins are required for efficient replication of SARS-CoV in the yet to be identified natural host of the virus. The use of animal models such as nonhuman primates, ferrets, mice, or hamsters may also be useful predicted ORF7b open reading frame into a bacterial expression vector as a GST-fusion",
