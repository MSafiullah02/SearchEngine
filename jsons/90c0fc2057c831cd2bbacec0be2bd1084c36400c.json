Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP) Dalpiaz & Cancellieri Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is an acute severe febrile illness associated with rapidly increasing respiratory failure. The diagnosis is based on clinical fi ndings and the presence of markedly elevated numbers of eosinophils in BAL fl uid. The majority of cases are idiopathic; occasionally, it may result from drug reaction or toxic inhalation. Patients respond rapidly to high doses of corticosteroids, usually within 24-48 h. The principal histologic fi nding in AEP is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) associated with interstitial and alveolar eosinophilia. Bilateral, patchy in a random or peripheral distribution, no zonal predominance Given that initial peripheral blood eosinophil counts are usually normal, therefore developing a clinicoradiologic differential diagnosis for AEP is often diffi cult. The radiologic differential diagnosis for AEP includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), and atypical bacterial or viral pneumonia. In contrast to these forms, patients with AEP usually have a dramatic response to corticosteroids, with rapid resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and radiographic abnormalities.",

In the subacute , proliferative (organizing) phase , the fi broblast proliferation mainly becomes prominent. In the chronic , fi brotic phase , 2 weeks or more after the injury, there is progressive fi brosis. The acute presentation and the histologic features are identical with those of DAD, so AIP has also referred to as idiopathic DAD. The average age at presentation is 50-60 years.

The exogenous chronic form results from the recurrent aspiration or inhalation of oil or from the accidental aspiration of a large quantity of lipid material. It can have an animal, vegetable, or mineral origin. It is possible in patients with obstinate constipation and long-term use of laxative or in patients who use Vaseline for oiling tracheal cannula. Clinically, patients may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecifi c symptoms such as cough, tachypnea, and mild fever. As a result, the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia is sometimes diffi cult to establish, and the history of ingestion or inhalation of oily material is often the key to diagnosis. Pathologically, macrophages containing phagocytosed oil fi ll in the alveoli and distend the alveolar walls and interlobular septa. Fibrosis is occasionally present and is of variable extent. The diagnosis of this disease requires a high index of suspicion and can be confi rmed by the demonstration of lipid-laden macrophages in respiratory samples such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid, or fi neneedle aspiration cytology/biopsy from lung lesions.

Radiology 173(TB), in the past also called phthisis or consumption, is a widespread and, in many cases, fatal, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Tuberculosis typically attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. The infections that do not have symptoms are known as latent tuberculosis. Pathologically, the typical form of TB consists of a necrotizing granulomatous infl ammation associated with a variable amount of accompanying non-necrotizing granulomas.TB (short for tubercle bacillus) Menzies D (2013) Update in tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease 2012.
