            "text": "Predicting popularity, or the total volume of information outbreaks, is an important subproblem for understanding collective behavior in networks. Each of the two main types of recent approaches to the problem, feature-driven and generative models, have desired qualities and clear limitations. This paper bridges the gap between these solutions with a new hybrid approach and a new performance benchmark. We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes selfexciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. To our surprise, Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches on existing tweet data [44] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. From these observations, we argue that future work on popularity prediction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling approaches in both classification and regression tasks.",

When presented with the task of predicting popularity, a clear gap appears between the two main classes of approaches: the feature-driven approaches and the generative approaches. Feature-driven approaches [3, 7, 25, 29] summarize network, user, and event history information into an extensive set of features, and they use machine learning approaches to predict future popularity. Generative methods [12, 34, 43, 44] leverage fine-grained timing information in the event series, however they make stronger assumptions about the diffusion process. A thorough understanding of strengths and weaknesses of the two classes is currently missing, especially since the generative methods are usually designed for explaining the mechanisms that generate attention, and not optimized for prediction. Another gap arises between the different problem settings. Prior work has address problems like predicting the volume of attention [34, 44] , predicting if a cascade will double in size [7] , whether an item will have 10 million views [33] , or be among the top 5% most popular [42] . However, the understanding of how the different approaches and the different features generalize over the various problem settings is incomplete. In addition, a practical bottleneck is the availability of certain types of these features, such as network data and corresponding features -for example the number of users exposed in the diffusion up to a time t or potential number of reachable users. A third gap in the current available work is the consensus and understanding about which features are informative for feature-driven models and the lack of benchmark datasets on which new methods can be devised.",

            "text": "In this paper, we address the above challenges in the context of predicting the final size of retweet cascades. We build two predictive approaches, one generative and one featuredriven, and we show how to combine them into a hybrid predictor to further increase performances. The generative method is a two-layered approach, built on the intuitive Hawkes self-exciting process [15] model. Self-exciting point processes are a class of stochastic processes, in which the occurrence of past events makes the occurrence of future events more probable. Three key factors in information diffusion are built into the proposed model: the social influence of users, the length of \"social memory\" and the inherent tweet quality. We use a predictive layer on top of the generative model to make final predictions. This helps us to take into account other cascades and mitigate limitations of model assumptions and parameter estimation. Our second proposed approach, the feature-based method, uses only Figure 1 : Two retweet cascades announcing the death of \"Mr. Spock\". The underlying diffusion processes of tw1 and tw2 are very different: tw1 lasts for 2.5 hours. It attracts the attention of highly influential users, especially music related channels, however the generative kernel of tw2 amplifies more than that of tw1. tw2 diffuses faster and ends in just 12 minutes, but the final sizes for the two cascades are similar (224 retweets for tw1 and 219 for tw2). We model and interpret these cascades using our generative model in Sec. 3.4. x-axis: time in seconds; y-axis: number of followers each tweet can reach; \u03c6m(\u03c4 ): memory kernel of Eq. (2) plotted with m = 1000.",

This results in a competitive feature-based predictor, which consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art popularity prediction model [44] -reducing the mean absolute relative error by more than 200% when compared to the latter, after observing the retweet series for 10 minutes. We show that the same set of features can be employed in both regression and classification tasks. We further experiment with a hybrid predictor, which uses both data features and measures issued from the generative model, and we show additional performance improvement. We conduct experiments on a large dataset, containing 49.7 million tweets containing links to top 10 news sites in English, gathered using the public API over a period of 4 months, in 2015. Fig. 1 illustrates two of the retweet cascades in this dataset, relating the passing of the actor for \"Mr. Spock\". Even though the two cascades achieve similar popularities, our generative model is capable of differentiating between their very different diffusion dynamics. For example, the memory kernel \u03c6m(\u03c4 ) of tw2i.e. the contribution of each event to the spawning of future events -amplifies more (shown by a larger area under the \u03c6m(\u03c4 )), but is forgotten faster (the entire diffusion ends in just 12 minutes).",

            "text": "Predicting popularity with feature-driven models. Data-driven approaches [11, 19] treat popularity as a nondecomposable process and take a bottom-up approach. They rely on machine learning algorithms to make the connection between item popularity and an extensive set of features. Most often the main contributions of such approaches are collecting large-scale datasets and constructing informative features. Bakshy et al. [4] and later Martin et al. [25] predict tweet popularity, defined as the total size of its retweet cascade. Both studies construct features relating to the user having posted the tweet and posted content. User features, particularly past user success -the ability of a user to start large cascades -are shown more informative, however prediction performances are limited. Martin et al. make the hypothesis of an inherent popularity randomness, which sets limits to its predictability. The situation is different when part of the diffusion cascade is observable, as early activity has been shown predictive for total popularity [29, 37] . When predicting whether a Facebook cascade will double in size, Cheng et al. [7] found that temporal features -like the resharing rate or the acquired volume of views -are the most informative features. Prediction performances are further improved when adding features which account for specific contexts of the information diffusion. For example, Li et al. [22] add propagation network measurements, Chang et al. [6] add sophisticated features relating to audience behavior when predicting the popularity of serials and Vallet et al. [38] construct features relating to two social networks: Youtube and Twitter. Many proposed features cannot be used outside of the proposed context, being either data-source specific or relying on information that is not publicly accessible. The feature-driven methods that we propose use only the best-performing features shown in previous studies and which can be extracted from public data.",

Such approaches have been successfully used in neuro-biology to model neuronal spiking activity [20] , in economics to model the evolution of stock prices [14] , in physics to model earthquake aftershocks occurrence [35, 17, 36] and in criminology to model crime patterns [27] . In social media such approaches have been used extensively [18, 30, 31] , mainly due to their capability to model phenomena like user interactions and diffusion susceptibility. Hidden network properties, such as connexions between individuals [23, 24] or the evolution of the diffusion network topology [13] , have been uncovered using generative methods, such as selfexciting point processes. The main difficulty with such approaches is scalability, since each social phenomenon must be accounted manually in the model.",

Popularity modeling [9, 12, 43] and prediction [34, 44] has been a particularly fertile field for pointprocess based generative models. In their seminal work, Crane and Sornette [9] showed how a Hawkes point-process can account for popularity bursts and decays. Afterwards, more sophisticated models have been proposed to model and simulate popularity in microblogs [43] and videos [12] . These approaches successfully account for the social phenomena which modulate online diffusion: the \"rich-get-richer\" phenomenon and social contagion. Certain models can output an estimate for the total size of a retweet cascade. Shen et al. [34] employ reinforced Poisson processes, modeling three phenomena: fitness of an item, a temporal relaxation function and a reinforcement mechanism. Zhao et al. [44] propose SEISMIC, which employs a double stochastic process, one accounting for infectiousness and the other one for the arrival time of events. It is the current state of the art in popularity prediction and, throughout this paper, we compare against it. Our proposed generative model uses the same information as SEISMIC -tweet timestamps and the number of followers of the user posting the tweet -, but uses a simpler, more intuitive modeling of the diffusion cascade.",

As one would expect, most cascades have a low value of \u03ba, and reflect the longtailed distribution of content quality. n * -descriptor of the virality of a cascade -is distributed very similarly to \u03ba, with most cascades showing low n * values (shown in the supplement [1] ). Parameter \u03b8 -which controls for the speed of the decay of the memory kernel \u03c6m(\u03c4 ) -has a more surprising distribution. Recent work [44] on point processes with power-law kernels argued that a unique value of \u03b8 = 0.242 is sufficient to explain the general behavior cascades. We find \u03b8 to vary in the interval (0, 2.8] and showing two maxima at 0.01 and 0.34. This observation indicates that learning individual memory exponents \u03b8 allows us to better describe the diffusion dynamics of each cascade. The distributions of the other parameters are shown in the supplement: c follows a long-tail distribution; \u03b2 shows a maximum of density around 0.08 and a smaller peak around \u03b2 \u223c \u03b1 \u2212 1 resulting from the optimizer terminating at the boundary of the non-linear constraint n * = 1.",

We consider that the Hawkes point process can benefit from systematically learning a predictor, to better account for data noise and limiting model assumptions. First, it is well know that using the number of followers as user influences mi is at best an approximation [5] and often does not scale with retweeting propensity. Second, the network in which cascades happen can be inhomogenous over the lifetime of the diffusion, e.g. users who respond early may have a inherently shorter memory than those responding late. Last, point processes cannot generate a meaningful prediction for supercritical cascades, and the model estimation can be prone to local minima. In this section, we leverage a collection of previously observed cascade histories to fine tune popularity prediction. This predictive layer accounts for the limitations above, and places point process estimates in a comparable framework as the feature-driven approaches.",

For each cascade, the dataset contains information about the original tweet id and start time and, for each of the retweets in the cascade, the time offset of the retweet and the number of followers of the user posting the retweet. We randomly sample the cascades in the original dataset and we construct Tweet-1Mo to contain 30,463 cascades of length between 50 and 5000.

The blue line denotes the overall median ARE shown in Figure 6a . Note that the y-axes are not on the same scale for all three graphs. Fig. 6 shows lower median and quartiles. This indicates that Hawkes predict better than Feature-Driven for most cascades, but the error distribution of Hawkes is skewed by outliers. Hybrid performs the best, with similar boxplot summarization as Hawkes, but with a 42% better mean APE -0.17 to 0.11 for 1 hour. The differences between Hybrid and all the other approaches are statistically significant (details in the supplement [1] ). This result shows that Hawkes and Feature-Driven approaches are complimentary, likely because they summarize the cascade information differently, and the errors are uncorrelated. ARE distribution over cascade popularity. Figure 7 presents the ARE distribution over cascade popularity as boxplots for each popularity decile. Both Hawkes and Feature-Driven predict better for most of the cascades with the middle popularity. For the extreme ends, performance is affected, because for lower popularity percentiles even a small error is amplified to a large ARE and cascades in higher popularity bins are inherently more difficult to predict. The prediction performance of Seismic seems consistent across popularity bins, but always worse than Hawkes or Feature-Driven, as already showed by the aggregated results in Fig. 6a .

As a consequence, it cannot be used in a classification setup.

Interestingly, combining the generative features with the datadriven features did not lead to a significant improvement, likely due to Feature-Driven already has stronger results than HawkesC. Admittedly, predicting whether a cascade will double in size is an easier problem than forecasting its final volume.

Existing feature-based approaches employ either proprietary insider information, or global network information that is impossible to retrieve with the limited access that are openly available. In this work, we bridge the problem space by first selecting a small set of features which can be obtained by using only free access services and constructing the Feature-Driven method. We further propose a Hawkes self-exciting model, which intuitively aligns with the social factors responsible for diffusion of cascades: social influence of users, social memory and inherent content quality. We systematically construct a predictive layer, which helps optimize predict from other cascades. We perform extensive evaluation on two large datasets: a benchmark dataset constructed by Zhao et al. [44] and a domain-specific dataset curated on news tweets. We compare the feature-driven approaches and generative approaches in two tasks: i) predicting the total size of retweeting cascades and ii) predicting whether cascades will double their size. Both our proposed generative Hawkes method and our Feature-Driven method outperform the current state of the art predictor. Performances are further improved when combining both approaches into Hybrid, which makes us argue that popularity modeling should leverage the best that both worlds have to provide.",

            "text": ". . . [ 14 ] Introducing Eq. [ 2 ] into Eq. [ 14 ] , we obtain:(mi) \u03b2 1 \u03b8c \u03b8 \u2212 (T + c \u2212 ti) \u2212\u03b8 \u03b8 [ 15 ] Hence Equation [ 13 ] can be written as,1. For differentiating L(\u03ba, \u03b2, c, \u03b8) w.r.t \u03b2, c and \u03b8, we first consider the 2 nd second term in the right hand side of Eq. [ 16 ] : [ 18 ] Using the logarithmic derivation rule and Eq. [ 18 ] in Eq [ 16 ] , we obtain the partial derivative w.r.t \u03b2:Similarly, we compute the partial derivatives w.r.t c and \u03b8: \u2202L \u2202c = out the task to evaluate how good our model fits the unseen data. In order to achieve this we first fit a model to all data seen till some time tN for a cascade and then estimate the log-likelihood of the unseen data till it's end time tM . We can get the log-likelihood of the unseen data by subtracting the log-likelihood of the seen cascade from the loglikelihood of the whole cascade after fitting the parameters on the seen part, it is defined as follows,For Hawkes we can easily calculate the value in Equation 22 by using Equation 16 for both seen and full cascade. But for Seismic the evaluation is not possible, as they do not derive the log-likelihood of their model explicitly. For Seismic the derivation of log-likelihood of unseen data can be written as follows,Now we can calculate the part A of Equation 23 by using Equation 1 in [1] and assuming that infectiousness once estimated at tN remains constant, as follows,Now for Part B in Equation 23 by using Equation 1 in [1], we have,Now using the trick used in Equation 14 and keeping in mind the fact that ti has two parts, i\u2208 [1, N ] Using Equation 24 and Equation 26 we can calculate the desired log-likelihood of the unseen data for Seismic.To present results for goodness of fit we use unconstrained optimization of parameters for Hawkes and compare it against Seismic on a sub sample of News dataset with 100 cascades. The results are laid down in Table 5 . As seen from the table, Seismic fits slightly better to the unseen data Hawkes, even though the predictive power of Hawkes is better as demonstrated in main text.",

The results for Hawkes and Feature-Driven are in general better than Seismic, but statistically insignificant among each other. Table 6 : Statistical testing results for Seismic, Hawkes, Feature-Driven and Hybrid models for the News dataset, indicating the algorithm with statistical significant better results. Win is decided when an algorithm has majority of lower error values than the competing algorithm and p-value confirms the results as statistically significant, else we mark it a draw in case of no statistical difference.
