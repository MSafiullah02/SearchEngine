Rhinoviruses occur year round except in winter.20 Rhinovirus is also frequently co\u2010detected by mRT\u2010PCR,21 as is bocavirus.22 Furthermore, enterovirus occurs from summer to early fall, and adenovirus occurs from late summer to fall; these seasons overlap with hPIV4, according to the KINRESS project. We therefore believe that this overlap is the reason that these viruses were frequently co\u2010detected with hPIV4 in this study.",

Thus, a strength of our study was that it included only Korean data, which was from a 5\u2010year period with a large group of enrolled children.",

Furthermore, our center is a tertiary medical hospital, where many patients were referred with illness from a primary or secondary health care center. There might be a sampling bias that resulted in missing mild illness, such as URTI. Our pediatric department was visited by few children with immunodeficiencies, such as hemato\u2010oncological diseases or immunodeficient diseases, so we could not explore the manifestation of hPIV4 in immunocompromised patients. Second, this study was performed retrospectively, and all data were collected from medical charts, limiting the data available for analysis. Although there are two subtypes of hPIV4 (4a and 4b), we could not distinguish between them. To overcome the limitations of the current study, further prospective nationwide multicenter studies are needed for a long period.",
