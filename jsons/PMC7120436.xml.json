Since then, it has become clear that there are many more aspects to the interaction between the RNA silencing mechanism \u2013 in plants, insects and mammals \u2013 and viral infection. Since RNA silencing is a central regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cell biology, it is involved in many different cellular processes. These processes not only include cell development, differentiation and proliferation, but also cell death, metabolism, transposon silencing and antiviral defences (2). Viruses, being strictly dependent on cellular resources for their replication, therefore interact with the RNA silencing machinery at multiple levels.",

Currently, three classes of small RNAs that are involved in silencing have been identified in mammals, namely microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) and piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs). Endo-siRNAs and piRNAs are primarily involved in the repression of transposons, whereas miRNAs regulate cellular gene expression (4). In recent years, miRNA-mediated gene regulation has received much attention. So far, over 700 human miRNAs have been cloned, which are estimated to regulate the expression of at least 30% of human genes (5). This regulation involves miRNA-guided targeting of the multi-protein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to partially complementary sequences in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of target mRNAs. Once RISC is bound to the target site, it triggers mRNA translational inhibition or destabilization (6).",

It has become clear that cellular miRNAs and other components of the miRNA pathway can interact with viruses at multiple levels to influence viral replication (Fig. 1). In this chapter we will focus on this multitude of possible interactions. For a good understanding of the way in which viruses interact with cellular miRNAs in mammals, we will first give a brief overview of different aspects of the miRNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways. Subsequently, we will discuss the effect of cellular miRNAs on viral gene expression, cellular miRNAs as determinants of the viral tropism for certain cell types, virus-encoded RNA silencing suppressors (RSS), and virus-induced changes in the cellular miRNA expression profile. Finally, we will discuss the use of miRNAs or miRNA-inactivating compounds in novel antiviral therapeutic strategies. Virus-encoded miRNAs, as expressed by the herpes virus family and other DNA viruses (14), will be discussed in Chap. 3.\n",

            "text": "Mature miRNAs are single-stranded RNAs of approximately 21\u201323 nucleotides that are processed from endogenously expressed primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) (15). These transcripts are produced by polymerase II and contain several imperfectly base paired hairpin structures. In the nucleus the RNA hairpin structure is excised by the RNAse III-like enzyme Drosha and its co-factor DGCR8 to form the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which represents an imperfect hairpin structure (16). There is a separate miRNA pathway that is independent of Drosha processing. In this pathway, introns containing the hairpin are termed mirtrons, which are spliced into pre-miRNA hairpins that access the miRNA pathway. First described in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, these mirtrons have recently also been reported in mammals (17). Both Drosha and the mirtron pathway generate an excised hairpin of approximately 60 nucleotides, the pre-miRNA. This pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by the nuclear RNA export factor Exportin 5 (Exp5), where it is further processed by the RNAse III-like enzyme Dicer in association with its co-factors TAR binding protein (TRBP) and PACT (18, 19). The Dicer-TRBP-PACT complex cleaves off the terminal loop resulting in the miRNA duplex with a two-nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang on either side. Depending on the structure, miRNAs associate with one of the four Argonaute proteins to form the functional miRNA-loaded RISC complex. In D. melanogaster miRNAs with mismatches within the central part of the duplex are preferentially incorporated into AGO1. The miRNAs with more perfect duplexes associate with AGO2, which is the only member of the Argonaute protein family with slicing activity. Similar sorting mechanisms are conserved in C. elegans and mammals (20). Once loaded into RISC, the miRNA duplex is unwound into a guide strand and a complementary passenger strand that is subsequently degraded. RISC programmed by the guide miRNA subsequently targets mRNAs with complementary sequences within the 3\u2032UTR. Pairing of the 5\u2032 7\u20138 nucleotides of the miRNA (seed region) to multiple sites within the 3\u2032UTR of an mRNA is important for target recognition and translational inhibition (21). The targeted RNAs are translocated to cellular processing (P)-bodies where they are stored or de-adenylated, de-capped, and subsequently degraded (22). It was initially thought that miRNA targeting could result in cleavage of the mRNA target, but only in rare cases. However, at the recent 2010 Keystone meeting it was reported that, in contrast to general belief, miRNAs do frequently induce RNA destabilization instead of translational inhibition.",

The siRNAs are loaded into AGO2-containing RISC and, in case of sufficient complementarity to the target mRNA, guide RISC towards cleavage of the target. In plants, worms and insects, the dsRNA precursors can be long virus-derived dsRNAs, e.g. replication intermediates. Once incorporated in RISC, the processed virus-specific siRNAs trigger the sequence-specific cleavage of the homologous viral RNAs. Plant and insect viruses counter this RNA-based antiviral response through the production of specific RSS factors (23, 24). In mammals, perfectly base paired long dsRNAs trigger the interferon (IFN) response that signals cells to induce the innate antiviral IFN response, which involves the induction of many different genes (25). Despite serious attempts, virus-specific siRNAs have not been detected in virus-infected mammalian cells via conventional cloning and sequencing techniques (10, 26). Because mammals have the IFN response and virus-specific siRNAs could not be detected, there was little support for an antiviral function of RNAi in mammals. Therefore, studies on siRNAs in mammals mostly focused on the use of artificially introduced synthetic \u00adsiRNAs or short hairpin RNA vectors as tools to induce sequence-specific knock-down of a gene of interest (27).",

Parameswaran et al. reported small virus-derived RNAs in cells infected with dengue virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), poliovirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and West Nile virus (12). In addition, Yeung et al. reported the accumulation of small virus-derived RNAs in HIV-1 infected cells (13). In this study, several discrete small virus-specific RNA species were detected. One of the HIV-specific RNAs detected was a molecule of 18 nucleotides that was complementary to the HIV-1 primer binding site (PBS). This is the sequence element in the HIV-1 RNA genome to which tRNALys3 binds to prime reversed transcription. This process is essential for the generation of the proviral DNA that integrates in the host genome and from which the viral proteins are subsequently expressed. Expression of the PBS-specific small RNA was found to depend on Dicer. Furthermore, this small RNA was shown to associate with Ago2, suggesting a role in antiviral responses. However, recent studies indicate that cellular tRNA molecules can also be processed by Dicer into 18-nucleotide long fragments in uninfected cells (31). This raises the possibility that the PBS-specific small RNA is of cellular origin.",

Reduced expression of miR-24 and miR-93 in Dicer-deficient mice caused a strong increase of VSV replication leading to virus-induced lethality. Besides VSV, the authors also tested the susceptibility of Dicer-deficient macrophages for infection by other viruses such as encephalo-myocarditis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Coxsackievirus group B serotype 3, influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and vaccinia virus. Interestingly, only HSV-1 displayed increased virus production, suggesting that Dicer-mediated antiviral RNAi responses do not represent a general antiviral mechanism in mammals. As miRNAs are differentially expressed among different cell types and viruses likewise infect specific subsets of cells, one should thus be extremely careful in drawing general conclusions. The lack of an effect on virus replication in Dicer-deficient macrophages does not exclude the possibility that these viruses are affected by Dicer deficiency in the biologically more relevant cell types.",

Certain nucleotide changes in the viral genome sequence will not be tolerated because they create more optimal miRNA target sequences that trigger repression by the miRNA machinery. This evolutionary pressure is illustrated by the observation that the artificial insertion of fully complementary miRNA target sites in viral genes results in severe attenuation of virus replication (36). This fine-tuning of the viral RNA to the miRNA composition of the host cell may also restrict the viral ability to adjust to a change in the environment, such as the invasion of a new host organism upon zoonotic transmission or the intra-host pressure when the immune system is induced. In addition to PFV-1 and VSV, cellular miRNAs have also been shown to target the RNA genome of HIV-1 and HCV.

HIV-1 is a member of the lentivirus genus within the family of retroviruses. Its genome is encoded by a positive-stranded RNA molecule of 9.8 kb that is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA that integrates into the host cell genome. HIV-1 replicates in CD4-positive T cells and thus causes a direct attack on the immune system, which when left untreated will eventually result in the development of AIDS. It was shown that miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382 are able to target sequences near the 3\u2032 end of all HIV-1 transcripts and suppress the expression of viral mRNAs in resting CD4+ T cells. The expression of this set of miRNAs is reduced in activated CD4+ T cells, thus allowing active virus replication. This finding suggests that miRNAs play a role in the establishment of viral latency. HIV-1 latency occurs in resting CD4+ T cells when the HIV-1 provirus is stably integrated into the host genome without producing new viral transcripts and proteins. HIV-1 latency may allow the virus to escape from the immune system and latency is a major problem in attempts to eradicate the virus in a patient by therapeutic intervention.",

The authors reported significant down-regulation of miR-93, miR-148b, miR-221, and miR-16. The miRNA profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-1 infected patients showed even more dramatic changes compared to cells from uninfected controls (46). Depending on the disease stage of the patient, the T cell specific miR-223, miR-150, miR-146, miR-16, and miR-191 were down-regulated 3\u20139-fold. Changes in the cellular miRNA expression profile can affect the expression of protein co-factors that are required for viral replication. For example, Triloubet et al. reported increased expression of eleven miRNAs in HIV-1 infected cells, whereas expression of the polycistronic miRNA cluster miR17/92 was strongly decreased (47). This miR17/92 cluster comprises miR-17-(5p/3p), miR-18, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1, and miR-92-1 and has been implicated in various types of cancer (48). Computer-assisted target prediction showed that the mRNA encoding histone acetylase PCAF has four target sequences in its 3\u2032UTR for miR-17-5p and miR-20a. PCAF is an important co-factor of HIV-1 transcription in interaction with the viral Tat protein. Thus, HIV-induced down-regulation of miR-17/92 increases PCAF expression, which in turn results in further enhancement of HIV-1 replication.",

In an earlier study miR-146a was shown to be increased in tumours (56). The T strain of the reticuloendotheliosis virus induces miR-155, which promotes cell survival (57). Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV), which is a highly oncogenic herpes virus in poultry, triggers the up-regulation of miR-221 and miR-222 (58).

These RSSs were shown to inhibit RNA silencing via sequestration of antiviral siRNAs, protection of long virus-specific dsRNA from processing into siRNAs, or via direct blocking of specific components of the RNA silencing pathway. The identification of mammalian virus-encoded RSS functions provided one of the first indications that the RNAi mechanism is involved in antiviral responses in mammalian cells. So far, a total of 11 mammalian virus-encoded RSS factors have been described (60). These include the following proteins: influenza A virus NS1 (61, 62), vaccinia virus E3L (62), Ebola virus VP35 (63), HIV-1 Tat (63\u201365), PFV-1 Tas (33), and HCV coat and envelop protein (66\u201368). Most of these proteins display RSS activity when co-expressed together with a silenced reporter gene. Other RSS proteins prevent Dicer cleavage in vitro. An interesting way to determine RSS activity is by means of so-called trans-complementation assays in which putative RSS factor functionally replaces a known RSS in the viral context. RSS factors from plant or insect virus suppressors can sometimes be replaced by RSSs encoded by mammalian viruses. Another commonly used assay is to measure mammalian virus-encoded RSS activity in plants.",

            "text": "There are a number of reports on RSS activity of the HIV-1 Tat protein. The Tat protein stimulates transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter by interacting with the transactivation response (TAR) element, a stable RNA stem-loop structure present at the 5\u2032 terminus of each viral transcript (69). Bennasser et al. were the first to show Tat-mediated RSS suppression in luciferase-based reporter assay (64). They showed that Tat-mediated RSS activity is independent of the transcriptional transactivation activity of the protein. We could confirm these results using an HIV-1 variant that is independent of Tat-mediated transcription activation (63). Only Tat mutants or heterologous factors that exhibit RSS activity could restore virus production of a mutant virus lacking Tat RSS activity. Another study showed that the HIV-1 Tat RSS function can be functionally replaced by the RSS protein P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus and that the Tat protein exhibits RSS activity in Nicotiana Benthamiana protoplasts (65). We also showed that the RSS protein NS3 of rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV), a plant virus, is able to complement the RSS function of HIV-1 Tat (70). The NS3 protein of RHBV is an RSS that exclusively binds small dsRNA molecules such as miRNAs and siRNAs. An NS3 mutant that is deficient in dsRNA binding and RSS activity is unable to rescue production of the Tat-negative HIV-1 variant. This result suggests that HIV-1 replication is inhibited either by siRNAs or miRNAs and that Tat RSS activity is required to counter this inhibition. Similarly, the Tas transcriptional transactivator protein of PFV-1 was shown to exhibit RSS activity (33). The Tas protein RSS function represses miR-32 accumulation, thus allowing efficient virus replication. PFV-1 Tas also shows considerable RSS activity in Arabidopsis plants (33).",

During the late phase of infection, the virus expresses high levels of two non-coding but highly structured virus-associated (VA) RNAs, RNAI and RNAII. Previously, these RNAs were shown to block antiviral PKR activity (71). The structured nature of the VA molecules shows similarity with pre-miRNAs, raising the possibility that the VA RNAs are Dicer substrates. It was demonstrated that the VA RNAs are recognized and processed by Dicer into virus-derived si/miRNAs that are functionally incorporated into RISC (72\u201376). Because of their extremely high expression level of up to 1  \u00d7  108 copies per cell, the VA RNAs cause saturation of the RNAi pathway. Thus, the VA RNAs act as suppressor by saturation of the RNAi machinery. It remains possible that the VA RNAs also represent a virus-encoded miRNA, but their extremely high copy number perhaps argues against this possibility (76).",

In mammals the IFN pathway is activated upon virus infection when viral nucleic acids are sensed by pattern-recognition receptors on the host cell. This activation leads to inhibition of viral replication and cell proliferation, apoptosis, and destruction of virus-infected cells by natural killer cells. The double function of many viral RSS/IFN-antagonistic proteins is perhaps not that surprising considering that both the RNAi and IFN pathways are induced by the same virus-derived molecule, dsRNA. Possibly, the RNAi and IFN pathways co-operate in the innate defence response against invading viruses. The antiviral responses against HCV provide a good example on how the IFN and RNAi mechanisms may co-operate to optimally combat virus infections (35).",

Indeed, direct targeting of the RNAi mechanism towards viral mRNAs can potently inhibit virus replication. RNAi-mediated inhibition of host factors that are required for virus replication is also being considered in RNAi-based antiviral strategies. The newly discovered interactions between cellular miRNAs and pathogenic viruses likewise provide new possibilities for antiviral drug design. In fact, the therapeutic use of such miRNA co-factors is similar in concept to antiviral silencing of protein co-factors that are required for virus replication. Targeting of the set of cellular miRNAs that have been implicated in HIV-1 latency has been suggested as a strategy to block or reduce HIV-1 latency (32, 86). HIV-1 latency poses a serious problem for the treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals with antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs can strongly reduce the level of replicating virus, but HIV-1 will rapidly re-emerge from the latent reservoir after stopping therapy. Antisense inhibitors of the latency-inducing miRNAs could counter latency and induce active virus production. Activation of the latent reservoir may eventually allow for purging of the viral reservoir, such that one can eradicate the virus in an infected individual and cure the patient.",

Insertion of miRNA targets in vectors can be used to alter the cellular tropism of the vector or to generate attenuated virus variants that may be used for vaccine development. In this strategy, the inserted targets are usually fully complementary to the cellular miRNAs, thus resulting in cleavage of the viral/vector RNA. For example, insertion of miR-142-3p targets in a lentiviral vector restricted transgene expression in the hematopoietic cell lineage where this miRNA is highly expressed, whereas optimal transgene expression was maintained in non-hematopoietic cells (91). Insertion of the liver-specific miR-122 target in adenovirus severely attenuated virus replication in hepatocytes, but allowed normal replication in other cells (92). Insertion of targets for the muscle specific miR-133 and miR-206 in the 3\u2032UTR of an oncolytic picornavirus, Coxsackie virus A21, strongly attenuated viral pathogenicity (93). Another example is VSV, which has been proposed as possible recombinant vaccine platform, but which causes encephalomyelitis in rodents and primates. By insertion of targets for neuron-specific miRNAs, virus replication in neurons could be inhibited without compromising replication in other tissues (94). A similar approach was used to construct an attenuated influenza A virus vaccine. Perez et al. inserted miRNA response elements into the open reading frame of the viral nucleoprotein. The resulting virus displayed a 2 log reduction in mortality and elicited a diverse antibody response, illustrating the potency of miRNA-mediated control of live-attenuated virus vaccines (95).",

This strategy could be employed when the expression of a certain miRNA is down-regulated upon virus infection in order to increase the expression of a required host co-factor. Overexpression of this miRNA should inhibit the accumulation of the host protein and thus inhibit virus replication. So far, this approach has not been realized, but miR-198 and miR-20 form attractive candidates for such an anti-HIV approach (37, 47). A potential danger of this strategy is that miRNA overexpression affects the expression of many cellular genes. In the optimal scenario, miRNA expression is restored to the level of the uninfected cell.",

However, because relatively few miRNA targets have been identified thus far, little is known about miRNA regulatory networks. Even more so, the way in which viruses interact with these systems remains largely unknown. It has gradually become apparent that an interaction between viruses and the host miRNA pathway can take place at multiple levels. To complicate matters further, cellular miRNAs can stimulate or inhibit virus replication, and sometimes a complex dual effect is observed. These RNAi-virus interactions vary significantly depending on the particular virus strain and the host cell type used for the infection, thus causing much variation among experimental systems. Many mechanistic details on how these processes interact and what the consequences are for viral replication, the host cell and virus-induced pathogenesis remains to be determined. Novel technology for high-throughput analysis of small virus-derived RNAs will help to answer some of these questions. It is likely that an increased understanding of these processes will ultimately lead to the identification of new targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics.",

Virus-encoded RSS factors may block specific RNAi actions. RSS factors like influenza virus NS1, Ebola virus VP35, and HIV-1 Tat can bind and sequester small RNAs/pre-miRNAs, whereas the adenovirus VA RNAs inhibit miRNA processing by saturating the miRNA pathway. Some viruses may depend on constitutively expressed miRNAs (HCV-miR-122). Increased expression of cellular miRNAs that target the viral RNA will result in inhibition of viral gene expression and decreased miRNA expression may increase virus replication. Changes in the miRNA profile may also affect cellular gene expression that may either stimulate or inhibit viral gene expression.",
