Although the mechanism of CoV transcription and replication remains poorly understood, discontinuous transcription during minus-strand synthesis is the currently accepted model. A nested set of subgenome-sized co-terminal negative-sense RNAs are transcribed from positive-sense genomic RNA by the viral transcriptase/replicase complex (TRC), which then serve as templates for subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) synthesis. The 3\u2032- end of the \u224870-nt leader within the 5\u2032-UTR contains a short (6- to 8-nucleotides) sequence, the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS-L), which also is present in the genome just 5\u2032 to each structural gene (TRS-B) [6]. Molecular genetic studies are consistent with a leader-body joining model which the complement to TRS-B on newly synthesized minus strands base-pairs with TRS-L to regulate the synthesis of sgRNAs by template switching [7], [8], [9], [10].",

SL3, which harbors the TRS-L (5\u2032-CUCAAAC) is only predicted to be stable at 37 \u00b0C for OC43 and SARS-CoV [11] (Fig. 1B). Mutations in the helical stem of SL1 or the loop of SL2 have pronounced effects on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) replication, largely manifest as a defect in sgRNA transcription [5], [11], [13]. Although the sequences and predicted secondary structures of MHV and SARS-CoV 5\u2032 UTRs are significantly different, the SARS-CoV SL1, SL2, and SL4 can functionally replace their MHV counterparts in the MHV genome and produce viable chimeric viruses [14].",

Here we report the structure of SL2 of SARS-CoV determined by NMR spectroscopy. SL2 adopts a tetraloop fold stacked on a helical stem. Tetraloops have been grouped by their sequence and conserved structures into five types: (i) GNRA, (ii) UNCG, (iii) ANYA, (iv) (U/A)GNN, (v) CUYG. Recently, they have been further subclassified according to specific deviations from the standard tetraloop motif, e.g., a 3\u20132 switch, deletion, insertion, and strand clips [15]. SL2 adopts the CUYG-like, insertion-type tetraloop structure which features a C47\u2013G50 Watson\u2013Crick (WC) base pair with the conserved 3\u2032 nucleotide, U51 flipped out of the stack.",

The SL2 construct used for NMR contains a non-native 3\u2032 A to stabilize the base of the stem. In the initial CYANA-derived structures, C47 was found to stack on U46 with G50 stacked on the A52 (Fig. 2\nA) and U51 flipped out from the stem (see also [5]). G50 adopted a high-anti glycosidic bond angle. These structural characteristics are found in the CUGG tetraloop structure containing a base pair between Ci (C47) and Gi\n+3 (G50) [22], a finding also consistent with the recovery of second-site C47A-G50U MHV viruses from G50U MHV stocks after multiple passages [5]. We therefore added hydrogen bonding constraints between C47 and G50 in the final refinement step, although the imino proton associated with this base pair could not be detected experimentally.",

The bundle of structures is well converged with 0.47 \u00c5 RMSD for all heavy atoms (Table 1\n). The stem adopts an A-form helix containing five WC base pairs with the 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide A57 disordered (Fig. 2B). The pentaloop is quite well defined and stabilized by base pairing and intra- and inter-nucleotide interactions (Fig. 2C). U48 base lies in the minor groove of the stem, with the orientation of this base not fully converged (Fig. 2B) but likely stabilized by hydrophobic contacts between H5 and H6 edge of the U48 base and the sugar ring of C47 (Fig. 3\nA). U49 stacks on C47 in the C47-G50 base pair and thus caps the helical stem and the O2 of U49 and H42 proton of C47 are in close proximity (Fig. 3A). U48, U49 and U51 each adopt a C2\u2019-endo ribose conformation in the SL2 structure, consistent with the strong H1\u2032\u2013H2\u2032 cross peaks in an 1H\u20131H TOCSY spectrum which reports on large 3\nJ(H1\u2032,H2\u2032) vicinal coupling (Table S2 and Fig. S2). In contrast, C47 and G50 adopt at least some C3\u2032-endo ribose pucker consistent with their weaker H1\u2032\u2013H2\u2032 cross peaks (Fig. S2) as might be anticipated on the basis of C47\u2013G50 base pair. The pentaloop is clearly more dynamic than the helical stem region, but this was not systematically investigated further. U51 is flipped out of the stack between G50 and A52. There are no inter-residue interactions involving U51, thus revealing that U51 is solvent exposed and likely mobile in solution; this is consistent with the sharp linewidths of the H5 and H6 protons [5].",

The structure of CoV SL2 reveals that the loop structure of SL2 adopts a CNGG(N)n tetraloop topology [5]. Fig. 3A and C show the structures of the loop of SL2 and Smaug recognition element (SRE), respectively, the latter of which is a member of CNGG(N)n tetraloop family. Both pentaloops stack on the stem closing U-A base pair. The first and fourth residues (C47 and G50 in SL2 and C10 and G13 in SRE) in the loop form a base pair in which the fourth residue adopts a high-anti \u03c7 angle (G50 in SL2 = \u223c\u221280\u00b0 and G13 in SRE = \u223c\u221260\u00b0) [22]. The second base (U48 in SL2 and U11 in SRE) lies in the minor groove and is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The third residue (U49 in SL2 and G12 in SRE) stacks on the loop base pairing interaction between the first and fourth residues on the opposite of the molecule. The fifth residue (U51 in SL2 and C14 in SRE) is flipped out from the stack. One difference between these two structures is the identity of the third loop residue in SL2 vs. SRE. The identity of this nucleotide is functionally unimportant in MHV since all U49 substitution mutants of SL2 are viable [5], a finding compatible with the structure.",

In fact, when a more stable SARS-CoV SL2 stem sequence replaces the native MHV SL2 stem containing multiple A-U base pairs at the base of the stem, both originally characterized lethal U48C and G50C mutations in an all-MHV context were found to be viable [5]. We therefore previously suggested that SL2 plays generic structural role in stabilizing a higher-order structure within the 5\u2032-UTR or a 5\u2032-UTR\u20133\u2032-UTR complex that is important specifically for sgRNA synthesis. Structural and functional data suggest that the identity of U51 is unimportant but may facilitate the folding of SL2 rather than specifically mediating a long-range RNA\u2013RNA or RNA\u2013protein interaction required for replication [5]. Interestingly, in all recovered \u0394U51 MHV viruses, U51 was added back in; furthermore, extrahelical U51-like residues are often conserved in stable tetraloops, including the 5\u2032-CNGG and 5\u2032-YNMG-like tetraloop structures. These findings suggest that U51 plays a critical role in stabilizing the loop structure required for virus viability.",

Fig. 4\nshows predicted secondary structures and free energy differences (\u0394G) between selected SL2 C47 and U51 mutants relative to wild-type SL2 [27]. As can be seen, all C47 mutations potentially extend the helical stem by forming an additional base pair with U51, creating a capping YYR triloop which can be stabilizing [28]. The C47U mutant may incorporate a canonical U47\u2013G50 Wobble pair with a wild-type-like tetraloop fold or a non-canonical U\u2013U base pair (U47\u2013U51) closing a YYR triloop as found in 16S rRNA [29], [30]. In addition, a U51G mutation is predicted to even more stabilizing (Fig. 4). Taken together, these predictions partially explain why C47 mutations in an all MHV context did not strongly negatively impact virus viability, but were absolutely co-dependent on the presence of U51 in the loop. On the other hand, our SL2 structure provides no clear structural rationale as to why U48C and U48A mutants were lethal in MHV [5]; one strong possibility is that these mutations induce misfolding in the 5\u2032 leader region, facilitated by the weaker SL2 helical stem in MHV relative to SARS-CoV (Fig. 1C\u2013D). Additional structural studies of the entire CoV 5\u2032-UTR will be required to substantiate this proposal.",
