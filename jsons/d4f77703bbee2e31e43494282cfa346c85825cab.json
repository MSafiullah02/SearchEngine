Those models have concentrated on early dynamics of transmission, epidemic behaviour with the application of different preventive measures, and infectivity dynamics of the pathogen [2, 4, 5] .

Sri Lanka provides free of charge healthcare at the point of delivery to the total population in the state hospitals. Currently, there are 628 state hospitals providing indoor healthcare facilities with the capacity of 83,275 beds. This makes 3.9 hospital beds per 1,000 population [7] . However, the majority of Sri Lankan hospitals provide non-specialised primary care and have very limited facilities and staff to manage conditions at an advanced stage such as severe respiratory distress. The preventive health care system in Sri Lanka is relatively strong with a dedicated field health staff, functioning under 347 Medical Officer of Health [MOH] areas which cover the entire country. Prevention, notification and control action on communicable diseases is one of the key functions of the MOHs. Hence, the ability to rapidly deploy health staff at the community level during an epidemic situation is a positive feature of the Sri Lankan health care system. Sri Lanka recorded its first case of COVID-19 on the 27 th January 2020. The case was a Chinese national who came to Sri Lanka as a tourist. The case was successfully treated and discharged [8] . The second case was detected on 11 th March 2020, a contact from an European tourist, some six weeks after detection of the first case [9] . As of 4 th of April 2020, Sri Lanka has recorded 159 COVID-19 cases, with five deaths [10].",

However, with increasing number of contacts to a single case, the field level difficulties in tracing each and every contact poses a threat of initiating community transmission. The Sri Lankan government initiated measures to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic even before the first case was detected in January 2020. Those measures were gradually strengthened through mandatory thermal screening at the points of entry to the country, followed by self-quarantine of those returning from designated countries from the beginning of March 2020. Mandatory institutionalized quarantine for arrivals from designated countries started on 10 th March. This was followed by self-quarantine for all the contacts and all passengers returning from outside the country. Entry points to Sri Lanka for all passengers was closed on 20 th of March. All schools, Higher Education institutions, and later, all public and private workplaces except those for essential services were closed. An island wide curfew was imposed on 20 th March to implement strict social distancing. This was relaxed intermittently for a few hours to facilitate access to essential services. These measures continue at the time of writing (figure 1), (S1 Appendix). Hence, Sri Lankan preparedness and preventive/ control measures for COVID-19 were unique compared with most other countries.",

Conventional compartmental transmission models assume exponential growth for the number of infectious cases during the early stage of a well-mixed epidemic [13, 14] . Therefore, the growth pattern of infectious disease outbreaks has been studied using exponential and/or extended versions of exponential models in the absence of control strategies [13] [14] [15] [16] . In the present study, we propose a combined hybrid type model which has both exponential and polynomial features with control levels. Generally, exponential models describe either a growth or a decay process depending on the nature of the exponential parameter; polynomial models describe the turning points of a behaviour. The experience gathered from the existing data on COVID-19 shows that pure exponential models may not be able to explain the behaviour of this epidemic. In addition, many externalities, as control measures, also influence the epidemic trend. Hence, we designed a hybrid model by combining both exponential and .

Keeping social distance of one metre is enforced even when the communities are provided with opportunities to obtain essential services to prevent the spread of infection.

Data sets in Sri Lanka are limited and so we cannot reliably estimate R0 at present, hence our need to rely on published data from other countries. Transmission of COVID-19 to immediate contacts and to their extended contacts will have a bearing on the propagation of the epidemic. In consideration of the available estimates of R0 and the contact cluster sizes observed in Sri Lanka, the risk levels were defined as 10%, 15%, and 20% in order to simulate the projections.

The effects of current public health measures towards the behaviour of the epidemic is important for decision makers. Continuity or discontinuity of such measures warrant evidence [2] . In the absence of many options to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic, it is vital to examine the available methods to manage and reduce the caseload that are currently in use [3] . Hence, in our simulation, we used three measures already enforced in Sri Lanka; social distancing, prevention of social/community gatherings through curfew, and hygiene practices. Our projections clearly show that the COVID-19 epidemic in Sri Lanka has a slow progression under control conditions. However, based on the three defined risk levels (variation in the levels of contacts being infected), the active caseload shows an increasing trend. Under a scenario of 20% risk, the trajectory of the number of active infected cases curve show stabilizing trend only after 90 days (over 1000 active cases) from the initial case. The results of the projections thus shows the importance of preventive measures to minimize transmission to immediate contacts and thereby reducing the possibility of secondary transmission to extended contacts. Failure to prevent this transmission could lead to a spill over of the infection to the community. When the number of active cases increases, isolation and protective procedures will be less effective to control the epidemic, needing interventions in the curative side [18] . In addition, practical difficulties would also arise in implementing effective quarantine for even the immediate contacts.",

Sri Lanka imposed an islandwide curfew on 20 th March after nine days of detecting the first active case in our dataset (second case in Sri Lanka) to maximize physical distancing. Although curfew was relaxed for essential services for few hours in between, the trend of the epidemic curve accommodated the effect of those measures during the last ten days of our data set (20-30 th of March 2020). Thus, the parameters in our model captured the effects of those control measures in the simulation to provide a reasonable projection. Our projection considered a 100% adherence to those measures to define Q as 1.0. However, realizing that behavioural variations need to be accommodated, particularly on keeping at least one metre distance, the breaching of social gathering prohibitions when curfew is relaxed, and by citizens not fully complying on hygiene practices, separate simulations were done to examine the epidemic behaviour. This is to provide additional time and opportunity for healthcare systems to respond [2] .",
