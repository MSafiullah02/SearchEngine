However, due to the rigorous efforts and stringent regulations, the incidence of new cases is abating. More noticeably, the case fatality rate in South Korea was 2.1% compared to an approximate case fatality rate of 6\u20137% worldwide [1,2]. The paper by Her et al. described in detail how COVID-19 spread in South Korea and what strategies were used for the early detection and isolation of cases [3]. In addition to extensive COVID-19 screening and rigorous contact tracing, stratified patient care was effectively applied in hospitals nationwide to care for COVID-19 patients.",

The infection rate related to hospitals was 40\u201390%, and the fatality rate was reported to be 19% [4,5]. During the MERS outbreak, the MERS taskforce team, MERS-dedicated hospitals, and respiratory care split hospitals were established to decrease nosocomial infections and avoid closing hospitals due to contagion. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we adopted those strategies from the beginning, and the COVID-19 community facility and dedicated COVID-19 emergency center were also established to address the transmission of COVID-19. This paper details how the lessons learned during the MERS outbreak were applied to contain the spread of COVID-19, especially in hospital settings in South Korea.",

Increasing the number of beds and reallocating health care personnel and facilities was needed to provide optimal health care. Therefore, the treatment locations were strategically determined by a collaboration between health care personnel and the task force team (Fig. 1\n) [6]. When a new confirmed COVID-19 case was detected, the COVID-19 task force team and regional COVID-19 management team were notified of the result. The regional COVID-19 management team assigned the patients to hospitals and beds depending on the disease severity and room availability. The treatment locations were divided into home quarantine, COVID-19 community facility, dedicated COVID-19 hospitals, and primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals, and the assignment was based on the results of patient triage. Those systems worked to offer focused patient care, distribute the medical burden and prevent a shortage of beds.",

In Daegu, the sudden increase in patients was threatening to cause a shortage of hospital rooms, and the number of beds needed to be increased. Mild patients were expected to quarantine at home, but some mild patients still needed to be monitored. Community facilities that were originally used for nonmedical purposes, such as training centers, resorts, and dormitories, were repurposed as monitoring stations for patients with mild COVID-19. Usually, freestanding buildings with good ventilation systems were used. Patients who do not need oxygen, especially those younger than sixty-five years old without underlying diseases, were candidates for monitoring in the COVID-19 community facility [6]. While patients stayed in the patients' zone, patients reported their body temperature and any symptom changes using a mobile app or the telephone twice a day [7]. Their general condition was monitored by health care professionals. Chest X-ray, pulse oximetry, and COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test could be performed there, and simple medication such as antipyretics could be prescribed [7]. If their symptoms showed clinically meaningful changes, they were transferred to the hospital.",

Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals were renovated to ensure they had a negative-pressure isolation room, negative-pressure transport chamber, anteroom, dividing walls and enough space between beds. Usually, they treat moderate to severe/critical patients depending on the facility. For example, Dongsan Hospital in Daegu, a hot spot for COVID-19, had more than 400 beds to care for mainly severe/critical COVID-19 patients.
