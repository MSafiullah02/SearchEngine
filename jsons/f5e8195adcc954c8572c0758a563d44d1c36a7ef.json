Among these case patients are more than 6000 health care professionals, and 94 physicians have died (2) . Lombardy is the most severely hit region in terms of hospital overcrowding, and its health care professionals face key challenges (2) . As the frontline first contact for patients with suspected infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), general practitioners (GPs) are frequently exposed to the virus and can become the source of community spread if not adequately protected. In Lombardy, more than 20 GPs have died of COVID-19 (3).",

Of these 450 GPs, 272 (60.4%) (Table) responded; in aggregate, these 272 GPs provide care to approximately 400 000 patients. During January to March 2020, a total of 108 respondents (39.7%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, or diarrhea or vomiting). Specifically, 54 of 108 (50.0%) had respiratory symptoms, 54 (50.0%) gastrointestinal symptoms, and 31 (28.7%) both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms; 77.8% of those with gastrointestinal symptoms had short-term diarrhea (\u22643 days), and approximately half of those with respiratory symptoms had symptoms lasting 7 days or longer. Only 18 of all 272 GPs surveyed (6.6%) had at least 1 pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing, 50.0% of them because of symptoms (8.3% of all 108 symptomatic GPs). Only 2 swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 1 in a GP with respiratory symptoms and 1 in a GP with only diarrhea. One hundred twenty-five GPs (46.0%) had at least 1 contact with a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 76.0% of the patients they referred to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2.",

Frequently in close contact with COVID-19 patients, GPs are likely at high risk for contracting and spreading the infection. One in 5 GPs in our study had suggestive symptoms, but few were tested and only 2 were isolated because of positive results. Although respondents were highly exposed and perceived PPE as a key need, less than half received PPE from the local health department (also their employer), the institution typically charged with providing essential equipment to GPs. Specific education on prevention and management of COVID-19 was also perceived as an important unmet need: More than two thirds of GPs had to self-educate because of lack of training from public institutions (Ministry of Health or local health department).",
