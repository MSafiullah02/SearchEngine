Pregnant women are not thought to be more susceptible to the infection than the general population. 2 3 However, changes to the immune system mean that pregnant women may be more vulnerable to severe infection. 4 Evidence from other similar viral illnesses such as influenza A/H1N1, 5-8 SARS-CoV 9 and MERS-CoV 10 11 suggest that pregnant women are at greater risk of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is some evidence that the risk of critical illness may be greatest in the later stages of pregnancy. 5 10 11 To the best of our knowledge, as of April 16 th 2020 there had been more than 40 scientific reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy published in English, 2 10 12 13 none of which were populationbased. The majority of reported cases occurred at term and women were delivered by caesarean section predominantly for maternal indication, although at least three studies reported cases of fetal distress. [13] [14] [15] Most women developed mild or moderate symptoms including cough, fever and breathlessness, and only a small number developed severe disease. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Risk factors were suggested to mirror those in the general population with one of the largest case series to date (n=43) reporting that nearly two thirds of cases had a BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 and nearly half had comorbidities such as asthma (19%), Type 2 Diabetes (7%) or chronic hypertension (7%). 15 The majority of neonates born to mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic and discharged home well. A small number of neonates had symptoms with a minority requiring admission to neonatal specialist care 14 15 , with only a few instances of reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the neonate. [20] [21] [22] [23] Three neonates had elevated serum IgM antibodies .

Previous published information has been largely based on individual hospital case series, cases identified across small series of hospitals but with a lack of clarity on the proportion of cases ascertained, or from registry data which are also likely to contain information on a non-representative series of cases, with problems of overlap and duplicate reporting; population-based data are essential to provide unbiased information on incidence and outcomes. During the period these data were collected around 90,000 women gave birth in the UK; 427 were notified as having been admitted with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy; fewer than 1 woman hospitalised for every 200 women giving birth. Approximately one woman per 2400 giving birth required critical care admission. The overall maternal mortality rate with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was around 1 in 18,000 women giving birth.",

Our sensitivity analysis suggests that this cannot simply be explained by higher incidence in the main metropolitan areas with higher proportions of women from ethnic minority groups, as evidence of effect persisted when women from London, the West Midlands and the North West were excluded. The effect also persisted despite adjustment for age, BMI and co-morbidities. Ethnic disparities in incidence and outcomes have been noted amongst non-pregnant populations with SARS-CoV-2 infection, notably in the US 29 , and a range of possible reasons have been suggested for these observed disparities, including social behaviours, health behaviours, co-morbidities and potentially genetic influences 30 . Health system factors have been suggested to underlie the disparity in the US; the fact that these disparities exist in a country with a universal free to access health care system indicate that the health system cannot be the sole explanation.",

This supports the current guidance for strict social distancing measures amongst pregnant women, particularly in their third trimester 2 . It should be noted, however, that higher hospitalisation rates in the third trimester were also reported in the context of influenza, 31 and thought to be for precautionary reasons, rather than necessarily because of maternal compromise. Although case notification has been augmented through a link with the UK Early Pregnancy Surveillance System (UKEPSS), 32 it is also possible that the route of identification of the cases included in this series, through UK obstetric units, has led to under-ascertainment of women admitted in the early stages of pregnancy.",

This observation of only mild disease has also been reflected in early case reports of infant infection in the perinatal period. [20] [21] [22] [23] Nevertheless, 2% of infants did have evidence of viral RNA on a sample taken within 12 hours of birth, which suggests that vertical transmission may be occurring. We have no evidence as to whether IgM was raised in these infants and therefore whether infection was acquired before or during birth, but three infants tested positive following pre-labour caesarean section. During the study period UK guidance for postnatal management of infants born to mothers with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection was to keep mother and infant together and to encourage breastfeeding with consideration of using a fluid-resistant surgical face mask for the mother. These findings emphasise the importance of infection control measures around the time of birth, and support the advice given by the World Health Organisation around precautions to take whilst breastfeeding.",
