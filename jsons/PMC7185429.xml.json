            "text": "The global importance of tackling infectious pathogens has been emphasised recently with the rapid international spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, and avian influenza, and the threat of bioterrorism.1 The prevention and management of infectious diseases in refugees, internally displaced people, and disaster situations is an ever increasing problem. One essential arm of defence is experienced and competent personnel who have received training in the management of infectious diseases and can work together effectively. National and international capabilities for handling infectious diseases are wholly dependent on communication, collaboration, and a solid bedrock of appropriate training. An understanding of the training provided across the international community would help to facilitate better collaboration and communication. In addition, increasing awareness of the training and skills of colleagues overseas may provide other benefits, such as highlighting training and research opportunities,2 developing clinical and public-health networks, and sharing educational goals and expertise. Combating emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases cannot be achieved by national initiatives alone, or even scattered international activities, but requires a cohesive international programme that includes collaborative training and research opportunities to prepare scientists and physicians.3\n",

Features of programmes that already exist will be described, and changes that are taking place in training in different countries will be examined. Although we focus on postgraduate training programmes for medically qualified individuals, we acknowledge the vast contribution from non-medical experts in terms of personal experience and training\u2014eg, nurses and paramedical personnel, basic scientists, microbiology laboratory workers, infection control practitioners, pharmacists, and epidemiologists. The short-term training courses that focus on more specific topics will be discussed. Our overall aim is to promote international understanding between different infectious disease specialists (panel 1\n). Furthermore, training directors could learn from the different models of programmes already established or being developed in other countries. Increased international appreciation may present new opportunities to develop productive exchange programmes, joint research programmes, supportive links, shared learning objectives, pooled web-based learning programmes, mutual recognition of training, skill sharing, and surveillance networks. To begin to disseminate information about training opportunities available, two of the authors (FJC, AHH) researched and directed the compilation of the UK manual Training in infection, which is currently being developed as a website (http://www.trainingininfection.org.uk) in collaboration with Imperial College, London, the National Electronic Library of Infection, City University, London, and the British Infection Society. This resource is currently directed at all trainees within the infectious disease specialties in the UK, but there is potential for international expansion.Panel 1Aims of this reviewInvestigate the international picture of postgraduate medical training in the infectious disease specialties.Review content of current training programmes.Compare organisational aspects of training programmes.Provide a platform for future research in this area.Promote international understanding between different infectious disease specialists.",

If so, details of the training were requested (length of scheme, entry requirements, syllabus, governing body responsible, supervision of the trainee, formal examinations/mode of assessment). Information on the number of infectious disease specialists in each country was difficult to collect and is not presented here. All questionnaire respondents were also encouraged to express their personal opinions on aspects of training, in free text.Panel 2Semi-structured questionnaire\n1Is infectious diseases a recognised specialty?2Does it require specialist postgraduate training?3If so, which governing body is responsible?4What is the length of a typical training scheme?5How does supervision of the trainee take place?6What are the entry requirements?7Is there a syllabus?8Is there a formal examination or mode of assessment?9Which specialties/areas are covered in the training programme\u2014eg, public health, HIV?10How many infectious disease specialists/consultants are there in your country?\n",

In some places the specialty has assumed a strong and structured clinical base, being largely teaching hospital centred, whereas elsewhere it has not particularly developed as an independent specialty. This difference may be partly due to the false perception in the 1960s that infectious diseases had been controlled, and partly because in some countries infectious diseases are so common they form the bulk of general medicine. Where specific postgraduate training programmes exist, there is considerable variation in training opportunities. Currently, little is known about the overall picture and the international skill mix in infectious diseases\u2014eg, in some countries microbiologists have a presence on the hospital wards and advise on specific patient management issues, whereas elsewhere they are solely laboratory based. Knowledge of national training programmes and an understanding of international training resources are vital in the management of current and emerging diseases and will undoubtedly contribute to the growth of effective networks and collaborations.",

The consolidated European Community Directive 93/16\u2014known as the \u201cDoctors Directive\u201d\u2014aims \u201cto facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualification\u201d. To facilitate the movement of clinicians between countries, there have been efforts to standardise training programmes within Europe. In 1958, the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS; http://www.uems.net) was established to \u201charmonise and improve the quality of medical specialist practice in the European Union\u201d. The UEMS aims to provide a training framework so countries can compare training programmes, and to help countries establish new written training programmes and log books. In most European countries, the training content is similar to that of the UEMS. Initially, not enough national authorities recognised infectious diseases as a specialty for it to be a separate \u201csection\u201d. Despite a growing recognition that infectious diseases still present considerable challenges, it was not until the mid-1990s that enough national authorities recognised infectious diseases as a specialty to apply for a new section. Approval was granted in 1996, and in the following year a section for infectious diseases was established as a sub-section within general internal medicine (http://www.uemsinfect.org). The Board for Infectious Diseases was established in 1998, and in 1999 the section approved a European training programme at the annual meeting in Geneva. The board proposed that there should be a 2 year minimum common trunk of general internal medicine and a 4-year minimum of specialty training. Microbiology is not yet an independent section but a subsection within the UEMS specialist section for medical biopathology.11\n",

For example, until recently the postgraduate examination for microbiologists in the UK (Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists) required submission of a research project or dissertation. However, the impression is that more infectious disease trainees undertake research for a higher degree, compared with microbiology trainees, as this practice is favoured for career progression in infectious diseases.

Although we are not advocating a \u201cmould\u201d into which all infectious disease trainees should be shaped, there is a need for a regionally adapted, common core syllabus, with more focused training for individuals. In our opinion, the core components of a training scheme should include a defined programme of supervised work and attachments, selected entry and exit requirements, national recognition by a professional body and objective external assessment (panel 3\n). The common training thread should be widely understood by international colleagues to enable productive collaborations and research. Furthermore, it would facilitate the rapid integration of refugee and overseas doctors working elsewhere. Our investigation has identified key areas for further exploration (panel 4\n). These areas include increased exposure to microbiology within infectious diseases training programmes, and greater experience in public health and infection prevention and control within all training programmes. The further development of joint infectious diseases and microbiology training schemes is welcomed, and new dual training programmes\u2014eg, combined public health and infectious disease training\u2014should be explored. To provide effective training, centres of infection should have a combined skill and expertise mix. Educational networks, particularly web-based distance learning, will become increasingly important and may further the development of surveillance networks and research collaborations. We welcome a comprehensive international study that includes trainees as well as training directors to explore these areas in greater depth and to optimise postgraduate training in infectious diseases around the world.Panel 3Proposed components of a training programmeCore syllabus, with additional training addressing local and national needs.Defined programme of supervised work and attachments.Selected entry and exit requirements.National recognition by a professional body.Objective external assessment.Panel 4Summary opinionCombined infectious diseases and microbiology training is regarded as optimal.Some infectious diseases training programmes are not considered to have enough microbiology experience.There is a need for combined public health/epidemiology and infectious diseases.Centres of infection need to have a combined skill and expertise mix to provide effective training.Infection prevention and control must be a substantial part of training.Networks of education, particularly web-based distance learning, will become increasingly important and may further the development of networks of surveillance and research.",
