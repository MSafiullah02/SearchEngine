Basic information including sex, age, etc., was collected. A COVID-19-related knowledge quiz, with 25 multiple choice questions and a highest possible score of 100 was designed by our team and filled out by the patients, the aim was to evaluate each individual's subjective factors about home isolation, personal protection, daily cleaning, and sanitation. Illness perception and mood state were evaluated by The Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire, respectively, both of which have been found to have good reliability and validity in Chinese (Wu et al., 2018 and Lyu et al., 2019) .",

In addition, 60 of the participants (51%) reported that they have infected family members. There were no statistically significant differences among educational background, marriage status, household monthly income, clinical classification of COVID-19, employment, place of residence, or comorbidity between patients with family clusters and other cases (P>0.05).There were 6 patients who reported 'unable to self-care', and all of them reported a family members' infection (P =0.01). The results of the IPQ-R showed that, compared with the cases without family infection, the patients with family clusters considered the consequences of the disease to be more severe (P =0.016), tended to lack confidence in treatment (P =0.020), and expressed less comprehension of the disease (P =0.040). The POMS showed no significant differences in the tension, depression, anger, fatigue, vigor, confusion, or esteem between the two groups (P >0.05) (Table 1) . Moreover, the patients involved in family clusters had a significantly lower COVID-19-related knowledge quiz score in a subgroup analysis of patients who had just had their diagnosis confirmed in the last 10 days (P =0.044), with a score of 76.7\u00b115.2 (mean\u00b1SD) in the family clusters (n=22) versus 85.2\u00b16.5 in the rest (n=17). Two questions had a significantly lower rate of correct answers in the family clusters group, which focused on virus decontamination (P =0.039) and the criteria for ending a self-quarantine of COVID-19 confirmed cases (P =0.048).",
