However, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly being recognized. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 who presented with acute pancreatitis (AP) without any other risk factors.",

The patient also complained of severe stabbing epigastric pain radiating to back for two days. Her only home medication was alprazolam for chronic anxiety. She denied a history of alcoholism, smoking, and similar symptoms in the past. Physical examination showed tachycardia (110/min) and fever (101.9 F) with hypoxia (SaO2:85% on room air) and scattered wheezing. Abdominal examination revealed severe epigastric tenderness. Admission laboratory workup is summarized in Table 1\n. Laboratory testing was pertinent for elevated (>3 time of upper limit of normal (ULN)), lipase (ULN = 82 u/l) and amylase (ULN = 103 u/l), and minimal elevation in AST and ALT. Triglyceride levels were unremarkable. Chest and abdomen CT scans were notable for the presence of multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities and normal gall bladder, biliary tract, with unremarkable pancreas respectively.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses, with infectivity in humans and animals, causing a myriad of symptoms [2,3]. While there was no direct evidence of viral pancreatitis in our case, the temporal relationship between pancreatitis and COVID-19, and lack of other etiologies would suggest coronavirus-induced pancreatitis. Coronavirus\u2019 potential to cause acute pancreatitis has not been documented to date in humans. A case-series of 52 COVID-19 patients reported that pancreatic injury (defined by any abnormalities in amylase/lipase) was present in 17% of patients [4]. There have been no reported cases of AP caused by SARS-CoV-2 is published literature. Although, there are reports of other coronaviruses causing AP in ferrets and pigeons [5,6].",
