An outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (officially and internationally named as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 by the WHO) occurred and spread to the entire China and multiple countries worldwide [2] . By February 14, the number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 reached 66 492, 8969 suspected patients, and 1523 deaths were identified in China [3] . By February 14, the number of confirmed patients and deaths were 37 914 and 1123, respectively, and the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.96% in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, which is considered as the origin of first cluster of patients [3] . The confusing and difficult thing for physicians is that they do not have specific drugs to either treat or prevent the aggravation and serious complications of COVID-19 for such patients [4] . Thus, Chinese herbs attract our attention, and investigations for different clinical trials are in progress.

She started to receive intravenous injection of cefotaxime in community clinic and took oral Jinyebaidu granules (another Chinese traditional patent medicine) and oseltamivir (75 mg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temperature from 37.6\u00b0C to 38.3\u00b0C for four days. On January 23, her chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation shadow in bilateral lung and subpleural regions (Fig. 1A) . She was highly suspected with COVID-19. Oral moxifloxacin and arbidol were prescribed, and she continued to take Jinyebaidu granules and oseltamivir. On January 24, her body temperature reached 39.9\u00b0C and experienced severe fatigue, diarrhea, and breathlessness despite continuous treatments of the above drugs. She felt better after intravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). However, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39\u00b0C) and breathlessness, and her blood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27.

The three patients were a close family, and the mother was the first victim with typical symptoms of severe viral pneumonia and confirmed as COVID-19 in accordance with the symptoms and chest CT scan. Cases 2 and 3 had close contact history with case 1, and 9 days later they became ill with positive diagnosis of COVID-19. All their symptoms resolved after using the Chinese traditional patent medicine SHL and rapidly recovered without obvious adverse effects when the patients showed no response and their symptoms continued to aggravate after other treatments, including IVIG (5 g per day) and dexamethasone, antibiotics, and antivirus compounds. SHL, a Chinese traditional patent medicine containing extracts of three Chinese herbs, namely, honeysuckle, forsythia, and Scutellaria baicalensis, is usually used to treat cold, sore throat, and cough with fever. SHL has been used in clinical practice for a long time because of its affordable cost and no serious adverse reaction. Recent news from preliminary study findings indicated that SHL can inhibit 2019-nCoV (http://www.cas.cn/yw/202001/ t20200131_4733137.shtml, accessed on January 31, 2020). Considering that no specific drugs are recommended to treat COVID-19, we started our clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029605) to investigate whether SHL can treat this disease and the family case is a part of the clinical trial. These cases suggest that SHL might be effective for COVID-19 although subsequent clinical trials are needed. In this family case report, we described two patients who had poor response to other treatments but responded well to SHL therapy. Case 3 showed positive therapeutic effect although he simultaneously received arbidol. Early treatments may contribute to patients' outcome and several errors, including taking antibiotics, and combination of two antivirus drugs should be avoided. This report suggests that SHL treatment might be effective for COVID-19 and warrants subsequent clinical trials to obtain sufficient evidence for clinical recommendation.
