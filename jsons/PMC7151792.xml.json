In general, with economic development, life expectancy increases and morbidity changes from higher prevalence of communicable to noncommunicable diseases. The causes of death from chronic noncommunicable diseases ranged from approximately 90% in New Zealand and Australia, 80% in Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and China, 50% in India and Myanmar, to 35% in Cambodia and Laos.1 Life expectancy at birth is highest in Japan and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China (80%), and lowest in Laos (56%) (Figure 120-2\n). Ideally increasing life expectancy should be accompanied by compression of morbidity and disability. There is little available data to determine whether there is compression of morbidity and disability in Asia, nor what chronic diseases make the largest contribution to disability. In Hong Kong SAR, China, active life expectancy at age 70 years is approximately 10 years for both men and women; however, total life expectancy and the life expectancy lived with disability (DLE) are longer in women compared with men, DLE being 4.4 years in women and 2.2 years in men. Diseases making the largest contribution to disability are stroke, dementia, fractures, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and diabetes mellitus.",

A review of epidemiologic studies on dementia in China showed rates at the lower end of the rates in Caucasians, with regional variation in the ratio of vascular dementia to Alzheimer\u2019s diseases.2 The prevalence of dementia ranged from 0.46% to 7.0%, whereas the annual incidence ranged from 0.81% to 2.02%, being slightly higher in women and those with lower education. Alzheimer\u2019s disease was the predominant type of dementia, followed by vascular dementia. In contrast to western studies, the prevalence of Lewy body dementia was lower in Hong Kong Chinese, with a prevalence rate of 2.9% over a 2-year period.3 Similar to Caucasian populations, presence of the apolipoprotein epsilon-4 allele is associated with more rapid deterioration in cognitive function,4 and an association has also been observed between promoter polymorphism of the interlenkin-10 gene and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.5\n",

The underlying cause is thought to be a consequence of a decrease in androgens, growth hormone, and IGF-1 that occurs with aging, accompanied by an increase in inflammatory cytokines. This is an important concept in geriatric medicine because it affects function and hence independence, and predisposes to falls. It was initially defined as a mean value of appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by [height]2 less than 2SD below mean values for young adults, analogous to the definition of osteoporosis. Using this definition, sarcopenia exists in elderly Hong Kong Chinese aged 70 years and over, but apparently at a lower prevalence (12.3% in men and 7.6% in women) compared with Caucasians (between 16% and 57.6% in men and 11% and 60% in women).14 However, the Asian young adult mean value was about 15% lower compared with published Caucasian figures, so that the actual prevalence may be similar between Chinese and Caucasians. Older age, cigarette smoking, chronic lung disease, atherosclerosis, underweight and physical inactivity were associated risk factors, while the consequences include poorer physical well-being, slower walking speed and chair stand, and reduced grip strength.",

Furthermore declining immunocompetence with age and many diseases or conditions commonly encountered in this age group predispose to tuberculosis, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, malignancies, or malnutrition. For example, in Hong Kong in 2007, the tuberculosis notification rate per 100,000 population rose steeply with age, being 55.2, 156.5, 464.5 in the 20 to 24, 65 to 69, and 85+ age groups, respectively. Similarly the mortality rate was 0, 9.4, and 63.9 per 100,000, respectively, in these age groups.

The elderly are also more susceptible to adverse effects from antituberculous drugs as a result of pharmacokinetic changes with age,17 hepatic involvement in military tuberculosis, and undernutrition, as in some parts of India.

In an effort to curb the spread in old age homes, the Hong Kong Geriatric Society issued a position statement pointing out the limitations of the World Health Organization criteria for SARS, stating some elderly people may have geriatric syndromes only, such as falls, confusion, incontinence, and poor feeding.21., 22. Furthermore, diarrhea may be mistaken for fecal incontinence. Multiple morbidity such as aspiration pneumonia further confuse the picture. Therefore a contact history was a key factor in consideration of the diagnosis. Other points to note are a lengthened incubation period from 14 to 21 days, higher incidence of side effects to ribavirin and corticosteroids, and a higher mortality rate. The latter could be a result of delayed diagnosis or reduced likelihood of ventilator support for those with multimorbidity. Failure to recognize the diagnosis constituted a risk of infection for all caregivers, and this pathway was repeatedly demonstrated during the months of the epidemic from March to June in 2003.",

The spectrum of geriatric medicine from the biomedical model to functional capacity, the immediate surroundings of an elderly person, ethical issues, and quality of life requiring interdisciplinary continuity of care, is not widely recognized. Countries that have been under British rule or influence, and that are economically developed, tend to adopt a perspective following that in the United Kingdom and North America. To address this issue, ideally undergraduate curricula should contain mandatory geriatric medicine teaching, with structured postgraduate training. Provision of undergraduate and postgraduate training is highly variable, being well-developed in some countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. In mainland China, although large cities have developed geriatric clinical services and research centers, most of the physicians are from system-based specialties, so that training in geriatric syndromes and a holistic approach is lacking. However, there are developments in this area in collaboration with countries where geriatric medicine training is well developed. For example, the China Medical Board of New York funded a 4-year project between John Hopkins University School of Medicine and Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, where Chinese staff were initially trained in the United States and then established demonstration services in Beijing using the train the trainer concept.23 The geriatric units in Hong Kong have also participated in training staff from the mainland.",

It consists of questions regarding intake of particular food items and anthropometric measures, with classification into three categories of nutritional status. However, it may not be easily translated into populations with different body size and dietary habits. Furthermore, in some settings it may not be possible to measure body weight due to absence of suitable scales for dependent subjects and lack of manpower, as in many old age homes in China and Hong Kong. A screening tool that does not depend on weighing is all the more important in such settings. The MNA was adapted for use in the Chinese population in such settings and validated in institutional settings in Hong Kong and Shanghai (The Chinese Nutrition Screen: CNS).32 A cut-off value of \u2265 21 was found to be useful in screening out those at risk or had malnutrition, correctly identifying 90% of those with normal nutritional status.",

However, in rural areas, health care expenditure is largely out of pocket.33., 34. In one recent survey, 87% of rural and 37% of urban residents were uninsured, and seniors, ethnic minorities, and residents in less-developed regions (where there are few doctors and geographic barriers exist) visited physicians less than those who were insured.

The anticipated shift from community to residential care is partly the result of changing social patterns from large extended families living together, to smaller units or to living alone. For example although the percentage of elderly people in Japan living with adult children is higher then Western populations, it fell from 50% in 2000 to 45.5% in 2004.37 This is in contrast to 30% of men and 38% women aged 80 years and older living alone in Australia. In both Japan and Australia, the number of residential care places is increasing rapidly, while at the same time the provision of community care services also increased, although the provision ratio per 1000 persons aged 70 years and over is actually decreasing in Australia. In Hong Kong, the percentage of elderly people living in residential care institutions has also risen rapidly from about 5% to 9% over a 12-year period.

The core components of symptom control and attention to psychospiritual needs remain the same. However, there may be cultural differences in management of patients and their families in these settings. For example, many elderly people defer to their families, who sometimes adopt an approach that is futile against the recommendation of the physician, out of a wish of \u201cdoing their best\u201d for their relative. Improved public education would be desirable to discuss these issues. In Western cultures, spending the last few days in privacy with relatives in a side room in the hospital may be considered desirable, but among Chinese people in Hong Kong, it may be reviewed as neglect by staff and relatives have sometimes complained about such management that was assumed by health care workers as desirable.",

A key to effectiveness of dietary and physical activity counseling is the strategy for achieving behavioral change, since simple impartment of knowledge is unlikely to be effective. An interesting cultural addition to these efforts is the role of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in healthy aging.46 The philosophy of TCM is to treat diseases before they appear, thus fulfilling the role of prevention very well. Theoretically and at cellular level or in animal studies, TCMs have been shown to inhibit uptake of neurotransmitters, to have anabolic effects, immunoenhancing effects, and antiproliferative effects on tumor cells, antioxidant properties, stimulate nitric oxide production in endothelial cells and erectile tissues, inhibit platelet aggregation, improve glucose tolerance, and have estrogen-like properties. However, few have been subjected to randomized controlled trials to document benefits in humans. Nevertheless, TCM is widely used in prevention of various conditions associated with aging, which may or may not be effective. However, adverse side effects have also been documented.",

The principles of care of the elderly remain unchanged, and could form the basis of training irrespective of geographic or political regions. Development in previous British colonies or commonwealth countries show how this diffusion of knowledge has occurred and is ongoing, through formation of the Asian Pacific Geriatrics Network.
