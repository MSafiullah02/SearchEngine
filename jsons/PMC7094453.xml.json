Especially for protein structure studies, one of the main bottlenecks is to produce adequate quantities of soluble and properly folded recombinant proteins.1 Fusion protein expression systems have been widely used for this purpose in basic research and in industry. Fusion domains (or small \u201ctags\u201d) are expressed as partners of the passenger proteins and are generally removed after purification, as they might interfere with the function or other biochemical or biophysical characteristics of the protein.2 Hence, some endopeptidases, such as bovine thrombin, bovine Factor Xa, human rhinovirus 3C protease and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, are routinely used to remove fusion domains. Of these, the viral proteases, e.g. human rhinovirus 3C protease3\n,\n4 and TEV protease,5\n,\n6 have proven to be the most selective and useful to date. Therefore, the development of novel viral proteases with high specificity and activity will be helpful to proteomics research.",

The coronavirus main protease (Mpro), which plays a key role in mediating viral replication and transcription, has been identified as the most attractive target for anti-SARS drug design.12., 13., 14. In 2003, our group published the first crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro.14 Thereafter, several other groups published the structures of Mpro,15., [16], [17] and its complex with an aza-peptide epoxide inhibitor.18 The Mpro can form a homodimer both in the crystal14\n,\n17\n,\n18 and in solution.19\n,\n20 Each protomer consists of three domains: domains I and II resemble chymotrypsin, whereas domain III has a globular cluster of five, mostly antiparallel, \u03b1-helices. SARS-CoV Mpro has a catalytic dyad consisting of His41 and Cys145, and its substrate-binding pocket is located in the cleft between domains I and II. The N-terminal residues 1\u20137 of domain I (or N-finger) of Mpro are considered to have an important role in its proteolytic activity,14\n,\n[21], [22], 23. although their importance in dimerization has been reported with inconsistent results.[21], [22], 23. In particular, mutation of Arg4, which is involved in forming an ion pair, results in a fourfold decrease in activity.21 Deletion of the N-terminal residues 1\u20137 results in an almost completely inactive SARS-CoV Mpro.23 SARS-CoV Mpro has been characterized sufficiently and two particular aspects drew our attention. First, it is highly selective for substrate sequence.24 Second, it displays a high level of proteolytic activity, although inconsistent kinetic parameters have been reported for SARS-CoV Mpro with k\ncat\n/K\nm ranging from 20\u201329,000 M\u22121s\u22121.19\n,\n20\n,\n25., 26., 27. These properties indicate that SARS-CoV Mpro is a promising candidate as an endopeptidase to remove fusion tags.",

First, the four amino acids AVLQ, which correspond to the P4\u2013P1 sites of the N-terminal autocleavage sequence of SARS-CoV Mpro, were introduced between the GST tag and the first residue of the protease. Thus, the authentic N terminus would become available by autocleavage during protein expression.

This strategy was intended to yield an authentic C terminus following cleavage by rhinovirus 3C protease, despite appearing unreasonable, since SARS-CoV and rhinovirus belong to different families (Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae, respectively). This strategy was used for the following reasons.",

However, they share several similarities in both cleavage sequence and the substrate-recognition pocket. From the native/complex structures of these two proteases published to date, the S4, S2, S1, S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 subsites are critical for substrate binding to the two proteases.12\n,\n14\n,\n18\n,\n32\n,\n33 Thus, the corresponding P4, P2, P1, P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 sites were taken into consideration when designing recognition sequences. Table 1 lists the C-terminal autocleavage site for SARS-CoV Mpro, and the substrate sequence for human rhinovirus 3C protease. It shows that the five sites are identical for the two proteases, with the exception of P2\u2032. The substantial difference embodied in the two substrate sequences is limited to P2\u2032. Hence, we reasoned that rhinovirus 3C protease could recognize the octapeptide substrate SGVTFQ\u2193GP, whose P1\u2013P6 sites were derived from the C-terminal autoprocessing site of SARS-CoV Mpro. However, replacing lysine with proline at the P2\u2032 site would arrest autocleavage. Our group has recently solved the crystal structure of a mutant of SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with an 11 amino acid residue peptidyl substrate (unpublished results). The complex structure revealed that substitution of P2\u2032 with Pro would result in steric hindrance between P2\u2032 (Pro) and the main chain of SARS-CoV, hindering substrate binding. On the basis of the above analysis, we hypothesized that rhinovirus 3C protease but not SARS-CoV Mpro could recognize the octapeptide substrate, SGVTFQ\u2193GP. SDS-PAGE analysis (see Figure 1(d)) showed that after Ni-affinity chromatography, the SARS-CoV Mpro is in the WT-GPH6 form, implying that the N-terminal GST tag was removed efficiently by autocleavage during protein expression in Escherichia coli. The difference between lane 4 and lane 5 indicates that the GPH6 tag was indeed removed by rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage, confirming that the modified substrate of SARS-CoV Mpro could be recognized by rhinovirus 3C protease. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis indicated that WT-GPH6 and WT Mpros were in accord with their predicted molecular mass (see Table 2\n).",

Within the dimer, protomer A was in the active form, while protomer B showed an inactive form, resulting from a partially collapsed S1 subsite.14 In contrast, the crystal of WT SARS-CoV Mpro belongs to space group C2, and each asymmetric unit contains only one protomer of a typical dimer (with the two protomers designated A* and B*). The two protomers in the dimer are related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis, and each has a catalytically competent conformation. All residues of the protomer (residues 1\u2013306) were identified from electron density maps. Apart from differences in the S1 subsite, the SARS-CoV Mpro protomer as seen in the new structure is very similar to each member of the dimer in the original structure (see Figure 2\n). Compared to the latter structure, the protomer in the new crystal forms display overall rmsd for C\u03b1 atoms of 0.6 \u00c5 for protomer A and 0.7 \u00c5 for protomer B.

In the S1 site of protomer A in our original structure (GPLGS-WT), the NH group of SerB1 was unable to donate hydrogen bonds simultaneously to the carboxylate group of GluA166 and the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA140, due to the presence of additional residues at the N terminus, although the distance is suitable for hydrogen bond formation. However, in the newly solved WT structure, the amino group (NH2) of SerB*1 in one protomer donates a 3.0 \u00c5 hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of GluA*166 (Figure 3(a)) and a 2.7 \u00c5 hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA*140, thus stabilizing the S1 pocket. This induces a series of conformational changes. For instance, the NH of GlyA*143, which participates directly in the formation of the oxyanion hole, moves by 0.8 \u00c5 towards the active site; the main chain of residues 142-143 moves towards the S1 subsite; and the side-chain of AsnA*142 flips over with a 6 \u00c5 shift. Stabilized by SerB*1, protomer A* displays a more catalytically competent conformation in the S1 subsite than protomer A in our original structure. In our original structure, the S1 pocket of protomer B is partly collapsed compared with the WT protomer: no electron density was visible for residues A1 and A2; GluB166 reorientates to interact with the possibly protonated HisB163; PheB140 undergoes a dramatic conformational change, with the phenyl ring moving by as much as 10 \u00c5; and GlyB143 moves about 3 \u00c5 towards the active site, leaving no space to accommodate a tetrahedral reaction intermediate (Figure 3(b)). These structural variations account for the higher activity of the WT protease compared with the GPLGS-WT and GS-WT proteases. We observed also that the GPLGS-WT protease has lower activity than the GS-WT protease. This might result from the additional flexible residues at the N terminus, which are located close to the active site and would hinder substrate binding.",

K\ni and k\n3 represent the equilibrium binding constant and inactivation rate constant for covalent bond formation, respectively.12 We assayed the inhibition of N3 against different types of Mpros to determine whether or not the additional residues would affect inhibitor binding. In our preliminary inhibition assays, we observed that N3 could completely inactivate WT and WT-GPH6 proteases after its preincubation with the proteases (fivefold molar excess of the enzyme) for 5 min, but not GPLGS-WT and GS-WT proteases (see Supplementary Data Figure S2). The strict kinetic parameters listed in Table 4\nshow that the second-order rate constant of N3 against WT protease (k\n3/K\ni\n = 18,800 M\u22121s\u22121) is approximately equal to that against WT-GPH6 (k\n3/K\ni\n = 15,400 M\u22121s\u22121). However, the second-order rate constant of N3 (k\n3/K\ni\n = 340 M\u22121s\u22121) against GS-WT12 is decreased by greater than 50-fold. This difference implies that the first residue of SARS-CoV Mpro also plays an important role in inhibitor binding.",

The substantial difference between the structures of the WT complex and the GPLGS-WT complex reported previously12 still lies in the S1 subsite. In the GPLGS-WT complex structure, N3 binds to protomers A and B of SARS-CoV Mpro in an identical and normal manner,12 thus we discuss only protomer A and A*. In protomer A of GPLGS-WT Mpro complexed with N3, the NH group of SerB1 was 3.4 \u00c5 from the carboxylate group of GluA166 and 4.7 \u00c5 from the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA140, both of which are beyond the distance for formation of a hydrogen bond. However, an ordered water molecule is situated at the bottom of the S1 subsite, connecting N3 and the protease. This water donates two hydrogen bonds, to the carboxylate group of GluA166 and the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA140, and accepts two hydrogen bonds from the lactam and the side-chain of HisA172. Although the water molecule helps to stabilize the inhibitor binding in the S1 pocket, it occupies part of the space of the S1 subsite. Due to steric hindrance, the lactam was not able to insert further into the S1 subsite. In protomer A* of the WT Mpro complexed with N3, no water molecule was found at the bottom of the S1 pocket. As a consequence, the carboxylate group of GluA*166 moves 1.7 \u00c5 upwards to form a 2.8 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with the NH of the lactam. The competent conformation of the S1 subsite is still maintained via the interaction of NH2 SerB*1 with the carboxylate group of GluA*166 (Figure 4(b)) and the main-chain carbonyl group of PheA*140. These structural data demonstrate that the first Ser1 residue is important also for inhibitor binding, and accounts for the more potent inhibition of N3 against the WT than the GPLGS-WT and GS-WT proteases.",

In this study, SARS-CoV Mpro was engineered to serve as a novel endopeptidase to remove fusion tags in recombinant protein overproduction. Table 5\nshows the advantages of SARS-CoV Mpro compared with other routinely used proteases in methods for production, substrate specificity and cleavage efficiency. Human thrombin and bovine factor Xa are both extracted from plasma, which requires more complicated procedures, although they possess a high level of cleavage efficiency. In addition, they are not as selective for substrate as viral proteases. WT SARS-CoV Mpro, which can be suitably overexpressed in E. coli, is highly specific for substrate. Furthermore, it has superior activity (k\ncat/K\nm\n = 26500 M\u22121 s\u22121) to rhinovirus and TEV proteases. Therefore, SARS-CoV Mpro is a suitable candidate for site-specific cleavage in fusion protein expression systems. The cleavage efficiency of WT-GPH6 is still high, despite additional residues at the C terminus. Highly purified Mpro in this form could be obtained by a simple one-step purification, as shown by the overloaded SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1(d)) For the sake of an additional six histidine residues at the C terminus, it can be readily separated from the protein of interest by affinity chromatography after removal of the fusion tags. These advantages suggest this form of SARS-CoV Mpro could have important industrial applications.",

            "text": "One disadvantage for recombinant protein expression is to commonly produce additional amino acid residues at the termini of the wild type protein. In SARS-CoV Mpro studies, several research groups have reported inconsistent results for the kinetic parameters of this protease, with k\ncat\n/K\nm ranging from 20\u201329,000 M\u22121s\u22121.19\n,\n20\n,\n25., 26., 27. The slight differences in methods (HPLC and FRET-based methods) and substrates used would not account entirely for this phenomenon. The first published crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro (with additional residues at the N terminus) by our group provided some clues that the first residue might play an important role in substrate binding. In order to clarify this point, we designed a new strategy to produce the WT SARS-CoV Mpro. We created a GST fusion product with a tag that can be removed via the autocleavage mechanism of this enzyme for three reasons: (1) autoprocessing will not produce additional residues at the N terminus; (2) SARS-CoV Mpro has been reported to have highly efficient expression in GST fusion systems; and (3) this method could be used to characterize the autocleavage efficiency of SARS-CoV in vitro. As for point (3), the affinity GST tag was a mimic of the transmembrane domain upstream of SARS-CoV Mpro in polyprotein 1a and 1ab, representing an autocleavage model of the Mpro\nin vitro. SDS-PAGE analysis shows that the GST tag was removed entirely from the N terminus through autoprocessing during expression of SARS-CoV Mpro in E. coli, exhibiting its high efficiency for autocleavage in vitro. In previous studies, it was hypothesized that the autocleavage of Mpro may occur in proximity to the membrane.13 Our data suggest that completion of autocleavage might be achieved in the cytoplasm, although the precise whereabouts of the assembly of replicase complex components remains to be identified. According to separate reports by Hsu and Lin,35\n,\n36 using autocleavage to remove tags such as thioredoxin can further support our hypothesis. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses belong to the Picornaviridae and the Coronaviridae, respectively. No previous report has shown that any CoV Mpro could efficiently process the substrate of picornavirus 3C proteases, or vice versa. In our study, it is interesting to observe that only substitution at the P2\u2032 site resulted in the conversion of the SARS-CoV main protease substrate into that of rhinovirus 3C protease.",

The stabilizing effect of the free amino group is obvious. In our published GPLGS-WT structure, the S1 subsite of protomer B is partially collapsed without stabilization by the first residue of protomer A, suggesting that the S1 pocket would be less stable due to micro-environmental changes. During the crystallization step of the structure determination procedure, a large quantity of WT SARS-CoV Mpro crystals could be produced over one night, which could easily diffract to very high resolution under the conditions described previously. In contrast, it usually took five to ten days to produce a very limited amount of GPLGS-WT SARS-CoV Mpro or GS-WT SARS-CoV Mpro crystals suitable for diffraction, albeit with comparatively lower resolution. As a consequence, the WT SARS-CoV Mpro reported here will be more suitable for activity assays, inhibitor screening and crystallization.

The 24 nucleotides coding for the eight amino acids GPH6 were added at the C terminus by the reverse primer. The PCR products were inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare). The resulting plasmid was then used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The sequence of the insert was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Positive clones harboring the recombinant plasmid were grown to an A\n600 of 0.6 at 37 \u00b0C by shaking in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml\u22121 ampicillin. The GST fusion protein was expressed by introducing IPTG to 0.5 mM with incubation continued at 16 \u00b0C for 10 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4600g (Beckman JLA-10-5), resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl) and sonicated on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000g (Beckman JA-25-50) for 30 min and the supernatant was collected. The His tag fused protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and concentrated in PreScission Cleavage Buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol). 50 \u03bcl of 3 mg ml\u22121 human rhinovirus 3C protease was added to 1 ml of the above 10 mg ml\u22121 WT-GPH6 solution to cleave the C-terminal His tag, producing an SARS-CoV Mpro with an authentic C terminus. The WT SARS-CoV Mpro was further purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The protein samples in each step were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis. WT-GPH6 and WT were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The purified and concentrated WT SARS-CoV Mpro (10 mg ml\u22121) was stored in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH7.3), 1 mM EDTA at \u221280 \u00b0C for enzyme activity assays and crystallization.",

Briefly, the substrate of the N and C-terminal authentic SARS-CoV Mpro was the fluorogenic compound MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (greater than 95% purity, GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd, Shanghai, China). The excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorogenic substrate were 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively. A buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.3), 1 mM EDTA was used for enzyme activity assays at a temperature of 30 \u00b0C. The reaction was initiated by adding protease (final concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM for WT and WT-GPH6, 2 \u03bcM for GPLGS-WT) to a solution containing different final concentrations of the substrate (3.2\u201340 \u03bcM for WT and WT-GPH6, and 6.4\u201380 \u03bcM for GPLGS-WT). The kinetic constants K\nm and k\ncat were obtained from a double-reciprocal plot (Supplementary Data Figure S1). Strict kinetic parameters were determined for the inhibition assay.12\n",
