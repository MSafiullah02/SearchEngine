However, initial worsening is often only observable in studies where participants suffer from an experimentally induced common cold.\n13\n Taking this lack of initial worsening as an indication of longer disease duration (ie, greater than 24 hours at the start of the study), our intervention might have been too late to have had an impact on the course of the disease. However, the context effect\n14\n or placebo effect\n15\n\n,\n\n16\n may explain the initial improvement of symptoms.

As more participants in the control group guessed correctly that they were in the control group, the placebo effect might have been higher in the intervention group.
