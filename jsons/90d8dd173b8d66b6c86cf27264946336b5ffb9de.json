            "text": "Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the intestinal nematodes of the genus Strongyloides. Of the 52 known species, however, only Strongyloides stercoralis frequently causes human disease. The parasite, which infects humans by the percutaneous route, is represented by small round worms 1-2 mm in size that are found mainly in the duodenum and upper part of the small bowel. Strongyloidiasis has two distinct clinical manifestations: intestinal strongyloidiasis, in which the parasite causes gastrointestinal symptoms, and disseminated strongyloidiasis in the immunocompromised host 1 with extraintestinal strongyloidiasis.The disease is usually rare in temperate regions. Recently, however, it has attracted attention as the cause of diarrhea in the so-called gay bowel syndrome. It is also a potential complication of AIDS. 2 In Japan, strongyloidiasis remains relatively common in the country's only subtropical region, Okinawa, even though the incidence of intestinal parasites decreased sharply after the war. 3 In clinical practice, meningitis or septicemia due to gram-negative bacilli may appear as a complication of disseminated strongyloidiasis in patients who are both Strongyloides-infected and immunocompromised. [4] [5] [6] The picture is further complicated because Kyushu, and especially Okinawa, exhibits the country's highest prevalence of antibodies to type 1 human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), the virus that causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Strongyloides infection is high in patients positive for antibodies to HTLV-1 becoming more frequent as their immune status declines and as they progress from carrier status to onset of ATL. 7, 8 The present paper reviews the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of strongyloidiasis, and describes the author's new methods for its diagnosis and treatment. and subtropical regions. About 1945, it was estimated that approximately 35 million people around the world were infected. These data are old, however. Furthermore, the lack of an established, standard diagnostic method leaves it unclear how many people in the world are actually infected with this parasite. According to comparatively recent reports, the carrier rates in various regions include 26% in the Congo, 9 48% in central Africa 9 and 0.4 to 4% in the southeastern part of the United States.I~ The carrier rate amongThai elementary school children was reported to be 21.9% using ordinary agar plate cultures which was newly developed by our group. 11 In Japan, there are carriers outside Okinawa and the Amami islands in the southwestern part of Kagoshima prefecture, but almost all recent reports come from those tropical and subtropical areas. The carrier rate in Okinawa was reported as 1 to 2% using conventional test methods, but testing by the ordinary agar plate culture method we have proposed 12 revealed a mean positive rate of 6.2% among the general population in communities in the mid-southern part of Okinawa. When this method was improved, the rate rose to 11.2%, with 98.5% of the carriers being 40 years of age or older. 13 Furthremore, the carrier rate among the general population in Okinoerabu region of the Amami islands in Kagoshima prefecture was 4% according to the ordinary agar plate culture method; none of the carriers was in the age range 20-49.14 Strongyloidiasis is a particular problem for patients with impaired cellular immunity: Igra-Siegman et al. 15 reported that 86% of 103 hyperinfected patients had had their immunity reduced either by an underlying disease or by therapeutic administration of immunosuppressants, Furthermore, the mortality rate was 77% in immunocompromised hosts, but only 43% in hosts without compromised immune systems.",

Japan has the highest ATL prevalence in the world, with the incidence especially high in Okinawa and Kyushu. In our study on inpatients 16 (Tables 1, 2 ), antibody to HTLV-1 was significantly more common in Strongyloides-positive patients than in those negative for the parasite (44.4% vs. 19.0%). The relationship held in reverse as well: patients positive for antibody to HTLV-1 showed significantly higher rates of Strongyloides infection than those without antibody (18.2% vs. 6.1%). It seems reasonable to suppose that reduced immunity due to the HTLV-1 infection resulted in a high susceptibility to Strongyloides infection, accounting for the correlation bet-~ een the two conditions. Patients with severe disease or with hyperinfection have lower levels of immunoglobulins and eosinophils than do those with mild disease and without hyperinfection. 17,18",

Although few drugs are fully effective, the s t r o n g e s t a n t h e l m i n t i c effect was f o u n d with thiabendazole. It is administered at a dose of 25-50 mg/ kg bid for two or three consecutive days. Relapses are fre- quent after a single course, however; two to three courses of treatment are required to completely eliminate the parasite. This drug has severe adverse reactions, with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, anorexia or liver dysfunction occurring in 60% or more of the patients treated. 35~6 We used this drug at a dose of 1500 rag/person (about 30 mg/kg). Pyrvinium pamoate (Poquil), administered at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg for five consecutive days, has almost no adverse reactions. However, since this agent is not absorbed, it is ineffective against heterotopic parasites and migrating larvae. In Japan, the decrease in the frequency of parasitic diseases led to marketing of this drug being discontinued several years ago.",
