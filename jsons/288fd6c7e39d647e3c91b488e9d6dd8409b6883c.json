            "text": "Yellow head virus (YHV) is a pathogen of the black tiger shrimp (prawn), Penaeus monodon, which is one of the world's major aquaculture species. Yellow head disease was first reported in central Thailand in 1990 from which it spread rapidly along the eastern and western coasts of the Gulf of Thailand to southern farming regions. Outbreaks of yellow head disease have since been reported from most of the major shrimp farming countries in Asia. It is suspected that the YHV (rather than monodon baculovirus, which is not usually pathogenic for juvenile shrimp) may have previously caused the crash of the shrimp farming industry in Taiwan during the late 1980s. Mortalities usually occur during the mid-late stages of grow-out in ponds with complete crop loss commonly occurring within 3 days of the first signs of disease. YHV is one genotype in a complex of closely related viruses infecting black tiger shrimp. Other genotypes include gill-associated virus (GAV) which has been associated with relatively less severe forms of disease in farmed shrimp in Australia, and at least four other genotypes for which no disease association has yet been established. YHV and the other genotypes are endemic throughout the Indo-Pacific region, occurring commonly as low-level chronic infections in healthy shrimp.",

In 2002, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) established the genus Okavirus in the new family Roniviridae to accommodate YHV and closely related GAV. Okavirus is derived from the Oka or lymphoid organ of penaeid shrimp in which the virus is commonly detected; Roniviridae is derived from the sigla rod-shaped nidovirus. Gill-associated virus was assigned as the type species of the genus because its biological and molecular characterization were more complete. YHV is currently classified as a member of the species Gill-associated virus. No virus other than those described in the yellow head complex is currently assigned to the Roniviridae but several viruses with similar morphology have been reported in crabs and fish.

Filamentous nucleocapsid precursors, approximately 15 nm in diameter and of variable length ($80-450 nm), are observed in the cytoplasm, sometimes densely packed in paracrystalline arrays ( Figure 1(b) ). Nucleocapsids acquire trilamellar lipid envelopes by budding through membranes into intracytoplasmic vesicles or at the cell surface ( Figure 1(c) ).

ORF1a (12 216 nt) and ORF1b (7887 nt) encode all of the elements of a large replicase complex. ORF1a encodes a 4072 aa polyprotein (pp1a) that contains a 3C-like cysteine protease catalytic domain flanked by putative transmembrane domains. The pp1a protease has autolytic activity and appears to be involved in processing the replicase polyproteins. ORF1b overlaps ORF1a by 37 nt. Expression of ORF1b requires a -1 ribosomal frameshift at a slippery sequence (AAAUUUU) near a complex pseudoknot structure in the mRNA. The extended 6688 aa polyprotein (pp1ab) contains RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), multinuclear zinc-binding (ZBD), helicase (HEL), 3 0 -5 0 exoribonuclease (ExoN), uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), ribose-2 0 -O-methyltransferase (O-MT) catalytic domains, and other cysteine/histidine-rich domains that are conserved in pp1ab of other nidoviruses. ORF2 encodes the 146 aa nucleocapsid protein (p20). Roniviruses are unique among known nidoviruses in that the nucleocapsid protein gene is located upstream rather than downstream of the glycoprotein genes. ORF3 encodes a 1666 aa polyglycoprotein that is processed to generate virion envelope glycoproteins gp64 and gp116. Proteolytic cleavage of ORF3 occurs at two [Ala-X-Ala] motifs immediately following predicted transmembrane domains that appear to function as signal peptides. The cleavage also generates a 228 aa ($22 kDa) protein that contains triple membrane-spanning domains and resembles M-proteins in coronaviruses. The YHV M-like protein appears to be present in infected cells at relatively low levels. The YHV genome also features significant noncoding regions, including a 71 nt untranslated region (UTR) at the 5 0 -terminus, a 352 nt UTR between ORF1b and ORF2, and a 54 nt UTR between ORF2 and ORF3. The 677 nt region between ORF3 and the 3 0 -poly[A] tail contains no long ORFs (>65 nt) and so also appears to be a long UTR ( Figure 2) .",

The 26 235 nt GAV genome is similar in structural organization to YHV, varying principally in the size and structure of the UTRs. In GAV, the ORF1b-ORF2 UTR comprises only 93 nt. The 638 nt region downstream of GAV ORF3 encodes a 252 nt ORF (ORF4) that has potential to express an unidentified 83 aa polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight $9.2 kDa. A short ORF in the corresponding region of the YHV genome is truncated with a termination codon after only 20 aa and is unlikely to be expressed. Like other nidoviruses, the GAV genome is transcribed as a nested set of 3 0 -co-terminal mRNAs comprising the full-length genome and two subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs) that initiate at conserved transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) in noncoding regions immediately upstream of ORF2 and ORF3. However, unlike coronaviruses and arteriviruses, conserved GAV (and YHV) TRSs are not present in the 5 0 -UTR of genomic RNA and so do not mediate splicing of common 5 0 -leader sequences on to the sg mRNAs. Sequences with partial identity to the conserved ORF2 and ORF3 TRSs occur upstream of GAV ORF4 (and the truncated YHV ORF4) but these do not appear to be functional. GAV has been associated with a less-aggressive disease of juvenile black tiger shrimp in Australia called mid-crop mortality syndrome. However, several other viruses have also been detected in shrimp with this condition and the etiology remains uncertain. GAV does cause disease and mortalities following experimental infection of several farmed shrimp species, including black tiger, brown tiger, and kuruma shrimp. GAV and other genotypes in the YHV complex have also been detected in healthy black tiger shrimp from Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mozambique, and Fiji. A very high prevalence of GAV infection has been reported in healthy black tiger shrimp from eastern Australia. Evidence of GAV infection has also been detected in mud crab (Scylla serrata) in an experimental aquaculture facility.",

YHV infects tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin, including lymphoid organ, hemocytes, hematopoeitic tissue, gill lamellae, and spongy connective tissue of the subcutis, gut, antennal gland, gonads, nerve tracts, and ganglia. In severe infections, there is a generalized cell degeneration with prominent nuclear condensation, pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and basophilic, perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusions in affected tissues.

For GAV, the progression of infection following experimental challenge has been shown to be dose related. Shrimp infected with a high dose of GAV progress rapidly to disease with high viral loads and typical pathology leading to mortalities. Shrimp infected with a low dose do not develop disease and the virus persists as a low-level infection for at least 60 days. There is also evidence that stress can lead to rapid increases in viral load. For YHV, the onset of disease has been associated with the stress of molting. During chronic infections, there is little histopathology other than the accumulation of partitioned foci of cells with hypertrophic nuclei (spheroid bodies) in the lymphoid organ.

There is also no evidence in shrimp of interferon, natural killer (NK) cells, or other key components of the vertebrate natural immune system that allow an immediate nonspecific defense against viruses. Nevertheless, shrimp do appear to have a capacity to respond to viral infection and highly pathogenic viruses are commonly present as low-level chronic infections in apparently healthy shrimp. For YHV, there is no evidence of an inflammatory response at the primary sites of infection. However, YHV accumulates in spheroid bodies in the lymphoid organ during chronic persistent infections, and it is thought that the lymphoid organ has an important role in filtering granulated hemocytes and the clearance of viruses from infected shrimp. It has been reported that cells within lymphoid organ spheroids become apoptotic during infection and may be cleared during molting. Apoptotic cells have been observed in lymphoid organs, hemocytes, and gills during acute YHV infections in what appears to be a fundamental host defensive reaction. It has also been reported that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to sequences in viral replicase and glycoprotein genes specifically inhibits YHV infection in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RNA interference may play a role in the host response to infection.",

Examination by electron microscopy has revealed virions in seminal fluid but not in sperm cells. Artificial insemination of infected broodstock has shown that vertical transmission occurs efficiently from both male and female parents. Transmission is probably by surface contamination or infection of tissue surrounding the fertilized egg.

Although the disease has been reported from many sites in Asia, isolates are currently available only from Thailand and Taiwan. Genotype 1 is the most distantly related to other lineages and appears to occur less commonly than other genotypes in healthy shrimp. GAV (genotype 2) is the only other lineage known to be associated with disease of any form. Analysis of complete genome sequences of prototype strains of YHV and GAV indicates similar nucleotide sequence identities for ORF1a (79.7%), ORF1b (82.3%), ORF2 (81.0%), and a slightly lower level of identity for ORF3 (73.2%). Aminoacid-sequence identities between YHV and GAV proteins are similar for the replicase pp1ab (84.9%), nucleoprotein p20 (84.4%), and glycoprotein gp64 (83.9%), and lower for the M-like protein p22 (74.8%) and glycoprotein gp116 (71.7%).",

            "text": "GAV has been detected in black tiger shrimp from Australia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences analyzed to date suggests that all isolates may have originated from translocated Australian shrimp. Genotype 3 has been detected to date in Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Mozambique. It appears to be the most widely distributed and most frequently detected genotype. Genotype 4 has been detected only in India. Genotype 5 has been detected in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. As indicated above, genotype 5 is genetically the most diverse genotype and may be split into three distinct lineages as more isolates become available. Genotype 6 has been detected only in Mozambique. Assignment of these genotypes has been based primarily on comparisons of sequences in a conserved region of the ORF1b gene. Analysis of nucleotide sequences in the 5 0 -terminal region of the ORF3 polyglycoprotein gene indicates more genetic variability and suggests that genetic recombination is contributing to diversity in the complex. Of 24 isolates examined recently, almost onethird were assigned to different genotypes in comparative phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences in the ORF1b and ORF3 regions. Genetic recombination is a phenomenon known to occur commonly in other nidoviruses. It appears that the vast international trade in live shrimp broodstock and seed for aquaculture is providing adequate opportunities for recombination and diversification of the gene pool. This appears to confound the assignment of coherent genetic lineages and may have significant consequences for both the emergence and definitive diagnosis of disease.",

Histologically, moderate to large numbers of basophilic, spherical, cytoplasmic inclusions in tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin are indications of YHV infection and can be used for presumptive diagnosis. Confirmatory diagnosis of yellow head disease requires the use of electron microscopy or molecular methods such as the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in situ hybridization assays. Antibody-based tests such as western blotting and dot-blot nitrocellulose enzyme immunoassay (NC-EIA) are also available. Low-level chronic infections with YHV and other genotypes can be detected by nested RT-PCR or other highly sensitive molecular genetic tests such as real-time PCR or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Accurate genotype assignment can only be achieved by PCR, sequence analysis, and comparison with sequences of other known genotypes.",

No direct link has been demonstrated between the presence of virus in infected broodstock and the appearance of disease on farms. Assumptions about vertical transmission come by analogy with GAV and may well be accurate. However, the prevalence of YHV in healthy shrimp appears to be far lower than for GAV and other genotypes, and it is unclear how it maintains a cycle of natural infection. It is possible that YHV is commonly introduced to ponds in healthy wild shrimp or other carrier crustaceans but surveys to date have not revealed a likely source. The host-viral interaction during the chronic phase of infection, the transition from chronic to acute phases, and the role of stress in disease emergence are also poorly understood, and there is little understanding of the molecular basis of virulence variations between YHV and other genotypes. A more comprehensive study of the sources of YHV infection and host and/or environmental factors leading to emergence of yellow head disease should be conducted. Emerging capabilities in shrimp genomics and proteomics will greatly facilitate this work.",

Inhibition of YHV infection in primary lymphoid organ cell culture has been demonstrated by treatment with dsRNA corresponding to YHV protease, polymerase, and helicase domains. Injection of shrimp with protease domain dsRNA has also been shown to inhibit YHV replication and mortalities. Knockdown of the shrimp dicer-1 endoribonuclease gene expression has demonstrated that the antiviral effects of dsRNA are caused by RNAi. RNAi technology has useful applications in studies of the molecular biology of YHV infection and, if delivered cost-effectively, could potentially find commercial application in the management of yellow head disease.",

Studies of the ronivirus 3C-like cysteine protease encoded in ORF1a have also revealed structural similarities to coronaviruses in the catalytic site but substrate specificity and binding sites are more similar to those of potyviruses, suggesting that they bridge the gap between these distantly related proteases. A pseudoknot structure and slippery sequence at the ribosomal frameshift site is also distinct from the H-type structures characteristic of many vertebrate nidoviruses.
