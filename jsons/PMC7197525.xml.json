Drastic measures are being taken to flatten the peak and slow down its progression to reduce fatalities caused by the collapse of healthcare systems and overstretched hospital capacity [1]. Intensive care physicians, emergency doctors, general practitioners, nurses and even cleaning staff are making a huge effort to support patients. As we have learned from China, Italy and previous outbreaks (e.g. SARS and MERS), medical professionals and first responders have a very high risk of infection. During the SARS outbreak, for example, one in five cases globally were healthcare workers [2]. Recent data from the COVID-19 crisis in Italy are equally alarming, indicating that 20% of Italian healthcare workers were infected [3].",

Some medical staff are seeing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients using PPE that does not meet safety requirements and is unlikely to provide adequate protection. Data from Italy suggest that healthcare workers experienced high rates of infection and death partly because of inadequate access to PPE [5].",

Beside the healthcare sector, other sectors such as uniformed service occupations (e.g. police officers, firefighters), office and administrative support sectors (e.g. couriers), preschool and day-care teachers, community and social services, service and transportation workers and even construction and extraction may be considered at risk professions [6].",

This may include lack of access to flexible working, lack of access to paid sick leave or inability to provide substitute workers [6]. Another aspect, which is currently overlooked, is the potential role of work and environmental factors in progression of the disease. Studies about other pandemics (i.e. SARS) show the impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and weather variables, on the spread of the virus [7]. In addition, it is not clear why the disease can lead to fatal pneumonia in some adults while others experience mild symptoms. Besides genetic factors, environmental factors (e.g. smoking and obesity) could play an equally significant role.",

It is also important for employers to set up a comprehensive \u2018infectious disease preparedness and response plan\u2019 tailored to their workplace, including addressing exposure risks, sources of exposure and routes of transmission, not only for the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, but also for future pandemics. This plan should additionally include how the company will deal with a reduced workforce, presenteeism and work planning changes. It should also provide guidelines and training for employees on risks, preventive measures, etc. [4].",

China and Italy have already faced a drop out of healthcare personnel, not only due to infection with COVID-19, but also due to the consequences of acute stress, frustration and isolation. Results of a multicentre survey involving 1563 medical staff, conducted in Guangzhou, China are alarming, reporting the prevalence of depression to be 51%, anxiety 45%, insomnia 36% and symptoms of distress 73% [8]. A study by Maunder et al. found that doctors providing healthcare during a pandemic face a substantially higher risk of developing long-term mental health problems due to chronic stress or traumatic experiences [9]. After the COVID-19 crisis, an additional dropout should be expected due to long-term mental health problems in medical staff. In the face of more fundamental threats, protecting mental health may not seem like a priority now. However, since it is likely that the demands on healthcare systems around the globe will exceed capacity for several months, caring for the mental health of medical stuff will be of utmost importance.",

Furthermore, employers should set up a comprehensive \u2018infectious disease preparedness and response plan\u2019 to prepare and support employees during and after a pandemic. The mental health of medical staff is extremely important. Learning from other countries (i.e. China and Italy) and past pandemics, we should act now to prevent a mental health crisis during and after COVID-19, and also for future potential outbreaks [10].
