Just as HCMV infection can profoundly alter the overall adaptive immune response (8\u201313), it also generates a powerful innate response. Key mediators of this innate response are IFNs. There are three types of IFN: type I (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03ba, \u03c9, \u03c4, and \u03b5), type II (\u03b3), and type III (\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4). Type I and II IFNs are the best characterized in the context of HCMV and their induction, antiviral roles as well as the viral antagonism of these processes have been extensively reviewed (14\u201319). A role for type III IFNs, in the innate response to HCMV and murine CMV (MCMV), whose pathogenesis closely parallels that of HCMV (20), has recently been elucidated (21\u201327).",

            "text": "The innate response to both HCMV and MCMV infection is initiated when virus is detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR2 (28\u201331) and TLR9 (32\u201334). Once virus has bound and entered cells, HCMV and MCMV can be detected by cytosolic DNA sensors such as IFI16 (35, 36), ZBP1/DAI (37\u201339) and cGAS (32, 40) that signal through the stimulator of IFN genes (STING). Each of these pathways culminates in activation and dimerization of IRF3 resulting in production of type I IFN (41\u201344). Type I IFN production is subsequently enhanced by upregulation of IRF7, an ISG that is also capable of dimerizing and activating the type I IFN promoter (45). HCMV and MCMV infection both trigger production of type II IFN from CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (46\u201348). HCMV even remodels the IFN\u03b3 locus (IFNG) for sustained IFN\u03b3 expression in NKG2Chi NK cells (49, 50). IFN\u03bb production is induced by HCMV and MCMV infection (22) and these type III IFNs are themselves ISGs with production stimulated by IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 treatment (51).",

            "text": "Key antiviral mediators of all IFN types are ISGs (52). Interferome, a database dedicated to chronicling all genes significantly regulated by IFN (changes \u2265 2-fold), identifies 12614 ISGs (53). Type I IFNs alone can trigger expression of more than 2,000 genes in humans, many of which are antiviral (54). Canonical induction of ISGs by type I, II, and III IFNs occurs by JAK/STAT signaling downstream of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1 + IFNAR2), the IFN\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR1 + IFNGR2) and the IFN\u03bb receptor (IFNLR1 + IL10R2), respectively. The type I and II IFN receptors are widely expressed but type III IFN receptor expression is limited to epithelial cells (55, 56). ISGs stimulated by type I and III IFN contain an IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) in their promoter region that is bound by the activated transcription factor IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), comprised of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 with IRF9 (55, 57\u201362), or by STAT2 homodimers associated with IRF9 (63\u201365). IFN\u03b3 induced ISG promoters contain \u03b3-activated sequences (GAS) that are bound by STAT1 homodimers (66\u201370). However, upregulation of some ISG mRNAs in the early stages of HCMV infection (prior to DNA replication) are not inhibited by IFN neutralization (71, 72). Since this discovery, the body of literature demonstrating ISG induction independent of canonical IFN signaling pathways has been steadily expanding and those discussed in this review are summarized in Figure 1.",

In trophoblasts, a cell type of particular clinical relevance due to their role in the transmission of congenital HCMV (104\u2013106), viperin is required for efficient expression of immediate early viral genes (107). Viperin is also known to enhance type I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by localizing to lipid rafts and acting as a scaffold for recruitment of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (108).",

Thus far, ddhCTP is known to act as a terminator of RNA synthesis by viral (Dengue and Zika) RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (109) and so investigations into its interaction with the HCMV encoded viral DNA polymerase are warranted. The viperin gene (RSAD2) lies in close proximity to the gene encoding cytidylate monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) in the genome, suggesting a potential functional link to this pathway (109). Expression of CMPK2 is so closely linked to viperin that, following stimulation by IFN, viperin, CMPK2 and a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) called lncRNA-CMPK2 are all co-transcribed (110). Interestingly, lncRNA-CMPK2 acts as a negative regulator of ISG expression (including ISG15, IFIT3 and IFITM1) (110). If IFN-independent, CMV-induced viperin upregulation also enhances expression of lncRNA-CMPK2, this could be a novel mechanism utilized by the virus to dampen the antiviral ISG response.",

During HCMV infection accumulation of both free and conjugated ISG15 can be partially inhibited by interfering with the canonical IFNAR signaling pathway with a JAK inhibitor (115) but some IFN-independent, IRF3-dependent expression remains (96). Whilst the mechanisms by which ISG15 regulates CMV infection are currently unknown, it appears to possess antiviral activity as blocking ISG15 accumulation enhances viral replication (115) and HCMV antagonizes both the production of unconjugated ISG15 and ISGylation (115\u2013118).",

Specifically, ISGylation of mitochondrial components can control mitochondrial function: reducing the rate of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and causing a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) (126).

A pan-viral mechanism of host defense mediated by IFITs is the sequestration of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF3) by IFIT1 which slows the overall rate of cellular protein synthesis (76, 84, 131). A more specific strategy depends on the recognition and binding of viral RNA lacking 2\u2032-O methylation of the 5\u2032 RNA cap by IFIT1 (132). This binding ability is enhanced by association with IFIT2 and IFIT3 (133). Despite the fact that CMV replication takes place wholly within the nucleus, export of viral mRNAs does occur (134) and these may be sensed by IFITs. Another possibility is that IFITs may directly bind essential CMV proteins in the cytoplasm, as IFIT1 does to inhibit human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (135, 136). Although the mechanisms of the IFIT-mediated antiviral response to HCMV are still unclear, a significant reduction in titer has been reported when the virus is grown in IFIT1 overexpressing fetal astrocytes (137).",

MxA is found in the cytosol and inhibits influenza virus infection through retention of the viral genome (146). On the other hand, MxB localizes to the cytoplasmic face of nuclear pores (147) and is able to inhibit HIV-1 replication by blocking nuclear viral genome accumulation (148, 149). Both MxA and MxB are highly upregulated by HCMV infection (73, 150) and it has recently been discovered that MxB overexpression inhibits replication of HSV-1, HSV-2, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), MCMV, and HCMV (151, 152). HSV-1 and MCMV inhibition manifested in a similar way to that of HIV-1, a block in the delivery of viral genome to the nucleus (151). However, in terms of the regions of protein at play, this mechanism was found to differ substantially with a requirement for GTP binding but not GTP hydrolysis (152, 153). Knockdown of MxB has also been implicated in stalling cell cycle progression (147) and it has been suggested that the HCMV virion protein pUL69 that contributes to the cell cycle arrest (154) does so via an interaction with MxB (155).",

A number of years ago it was discovered that HCMV DNA could induce ISG expression in an IRF3-dependent, TLR-independent manner that involved TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), I\u03baB kinase epsilon [IKK\u03b5; originally called IKK-inducible (IKKi)], and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (157). More recently, peroxisomal MAVS has been implicated in rapid type-I IFN-independent ISG (viperin, Mx2, IFIT3, IFIT2) expression (158). Conversely, mitochondrial MAVS appears to be involved in IFN-dependent ISG production (158). HCMV actively impairs mitochondrial MAVS signaling through the viral mitochondria-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA) and reduces type I IFN production (159). vMIA has also been found to localize to peroxisomes and induce their fragmentation by interaction with the cytoplasmic chaperone protein Pex19, hijacking the transport machinery of peroxisomal membrane proteins (160). This suggests that disabling IFN-independent ISG transcription induced by peroxisomal MAVS contributes to efficient CMV infection.",

HCMV IE1 induces expression of IL-6 (161) which usually signals through JAK and STAT3 (162). However, IE1 binds and sequesters STAT3 (163), leaving JAK, already activated by IL-6, free to phosphorylate STAT1. Thus IE1 re-routes IL-6 signaling to activate STAT1 resulting in transcription of ISGs independently of IFN (164).",

Intriguingly, whilst high multiplicity of infection (MOI) UV-HCMV also induced an antiviral state in the HELFs, this required IFN production (91). Paladino et al. (91) proposed a model by which, when cells are exposed to limited numbers of virus particles (low MOI), induction of an internal antiviral state is sufficient to control infection, however, when many virus particles are present (high MOI), cells secrete IFN to protect neighboring cells too. The ability to induce an antiviral state in the absence of IFN production may be important in cells such as neurons, where inflammation is undesirable. In this respect, neurotropic arboviruses have been shown to induce protective type I IFN-independent, IRF3-dependent responses (165).",

The intention of this review has been to highlight the substantial body of literature accumulating around IFN-independent innate responses to CMV. IFN-independent induction of ISGs is an important phenomenon and ISGs produced via this pathway appear to play both pro- and anti-viral roles during infection. This complicates direct interrogation of the IFN response during viral infection and necessitates careful consideration of kinetics, as particular ISG may be upregulated directly by the virus, independently of IFN, to play a proviral role early in infection but later on, when IFN-dependent expression dominates, may antagonize infection.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Induction and subversion of the innate IFN response by HCMV. (A) Sensing of HCMV by components of the innate immune response initiates production of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. HCMV is sensed by PRRs on the cell surface (TLR2) and in endosomes (TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9). Signaling from TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 is through MyD88 and results in the activation and nuclear translocation NF\u03baB, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-6. TLR9 and TLR4 signal through TRIF which causes activation by phosphorylation of IRF3 via TBK1/IKK\u03b5, activated IRF3 dimerizes and enters the nucleus to stimulate production of type I IFNs. HCMV infection can also be recognized by viral nucleic acid detectors in the cytoplasm; DNA sensors ZBP1, IFI16 and cGAS signal through ER-resident STING to activate TBK1/IKK\u03b5 whilst the viral RNA sensor RIG-I activates TBK1/IKK\u03b5 by signaling via MAVS located on the mitochondria or peroxisomes. The end result of both of these pathways is IRF3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation and production of type I IFNs. (B) IFN-dependent and IFN-independent pathways of ISG induction during HCMV infection. For IFN-dependent induction of ISGs to occur type I, type II and type III IFNs must bind to their cell surface receptors. Type I and III IFN receptors signal through various combinations of JAK proteins to phosphorylate STAT1 or STAT1 and STAT2 which form a complex referred to as ISGF3 with IRF9. ISGF3 then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the ISRE to induce ISG production. The type II IFN receptor utilizes both JAK1 and JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT1, leading to its dimerization and nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, activated STAT1 dimers bind to GAS and stimulate ISG production. The three key pathways of HCMV-mediated IFN-independent ISG induction are indicated in red. Firstly, HCMV can directly activate IRF3; additionally, HCMV can sequester STAT3 and redirect the activated JAK1, created by IL-6 receptor binding, to phosphorylate STAT1; and finally peroxisomal MAVS may be able to trigger IFN-independent ISG expression at early times following infection.
