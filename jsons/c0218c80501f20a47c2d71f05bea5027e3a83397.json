In fact, even for humans, it requires a subtle analysis and comprehensive knowledge of algorithms to predict time complexity with high fidelity, given any code. As per Turing's Halting problem proof, estimating code complexity is mathematically impossible. Nevertheless, an approximate solution to such a task can help developers to get real-time feedback for the efficiency of their code. In this work, we model this problem as a machine learning task and check its feasibility with thorough analysis. Due to the lack of any open source dataset for this task, we propose our own annotated dataset, (The complete dataset is available for use at https://github.com/midas-research/corcod-dataset/blob/master/ README.md) CoRCoD: Code Runtime Complexity Dataset, extracted from online coding platforms. We establish baselines using two different approaches: feature engineering and code embeddings, to achieve state of the art results and compare their performances. Such solutions can be highly useful in potential applications like automatically grading coding assignments, IDE-integrated tools for static code analysis, and others.",

It is a measure of the performance of a solution for a given problem. As a popular mistaken consideration, it is not the execution time of a code. Execution time depends upon a number of factors such as the operating system, hardware, processors etc. Since execution time is machine dependent, it is not used as a standard measure to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. Formally, Time Complexity quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to process as a function of the input. For a given algorithm, we consider its worst case complexity, which reflects the maximum time required to process it, given an input. Time complexity is represented in Big O notation, i.e., O(n) denotes the asymptotic linear upper bound of an algorithm as a function of the input size n. Typically, the complexity classes in Computer Science refer to P and NP classes of decision problems, however, for the entire length of this paper, complexity class refers to a category of time complexity. The commonly considered categories in computer science as well in our work are O (1) , O(logn) , O(n) , O(nlogn) and O(n 2 ).",

The large availability of contests having a wide variety of problems both in terms of data structures and algorithms as well as runtime complexity, made Codeforces a viable choice for our dataset. For the purpose of construction of our dataset, we collected Java source codes from Codeforces. We used the Codeforces API to retrieve problem and contest information, and further used web scraping to download the solution source codes. Sampling of source codes is done on the basis of data structure/algorithm tags associated with the problem, e.g., binary search, sorting etc. to ensure that the dataset contains source codes belonging to different complexity classes.",

For codes having TLE verdict, we ensured accuracy of solutions by only selecting codes that successfully passed at least four Test Cases. This criterion also allowed us to include multiple solutions for a single problem, different solutions having different runtime complexities. These codes were then manually annotated by a group of five experts, hailing from programming background each with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Each code was analyzed and annotated by two experts, in order to minimize the potential for error. Since calculating time complexity of a program comprises well-defined steps, interannotator agreement in our case was 100% (Cohen's kappa coefficient was 1). Only the order of complexity was recorded, for example, a solution having two variable inputs, n and m, and having a runtime complexity of O(n * m) is labeled as n square (O(n 2 )).",

We extracted these features from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of source codes. AST is a tree representation of syntax rules of a programming language. ASTs are used by compilers to check codes for accuracy. We used Eclipse JDT for feature extraction. A generic representation of AST as parsed by ASTParser in JDT is shown in Fig. 1 . An ASTParser object creates the AST, and the ASTVisitor object \"visits\" the nodes of the tree via visit and endVisit methods using Depth First Search. One of the features chosen was the maximum depth of nested loops. Code snippet (Listing 1) depicts how the value of depth of nested loops was calculated using ASTVisitor provided by JDT.

The same technique was also used while creating the AST for the next baseline. Figure 2 represents the density distribution of features across different classes. For nested loops, n square has peak at depth 2 as expected; similarly n and nlogn have peak at depth 1 loop depth (see Fig. 2(a) ). For number of loops (see Fig. 2(b) ), we find that the mean value of the number of loops in code increases with the increase in complexity. On qualitative analysis, we find out that in case of O(n) complexity, one loop is being used in code for processing the inputs and the other loop is being used for computing the solution to the problem. As we move towards O(n square) codes, there is often one nested loop in the code and one loop is being used for input processing. Hence, it has a peak centered at a frequency of 3. This confirms our intuition that number of loops and nested loops are important parameters in complexity computation.",

            "text": "The dataset presented and the baseline models established should serve as guidelines for the future work in this area. The dataset presented is balanced and wellcurated. Though both the baselines; Code Embeddings and Handcrafted features have comparable accuracy, we have established through data ablation tests that code embeddings learned from Abstract Syntax Tree of the code better capture relationships between different code constructs that are essential for predicting runtime complexity. Work can be done in future to increase the size of the dataset to verify our hypothesis that code embeddings will perform significantly better than hand crafted features. Moreover, we hope that the approaches discussed in this work, their usage becomes explicit for programmers and learners to bring into practice efficient and optimized codes.",
