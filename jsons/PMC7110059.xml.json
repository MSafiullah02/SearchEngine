Ball et al6 investigated 1035 children as part of the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study. Children with older siblings at home or who attended day care and, therefore, were more likely to be exposed to respiratory virus infections, were more likely to have frequent wheezing (more than 3 episodes in the preceding year) at age 2 years, but were less likely to have frequent wheezing from ages 6\u201313 years (Fig. 1).

Of course such infections are themselves associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and this has been dramatically reduced by preventive strategies such as improvements in public health and measles vaccination. It is possible that some infections help the immune system to mature from an early predominantly Th2-biased state19 towards a Th1-biased state and that in their absence, in individuals predisposed by genetic or additional environmental factors such as allergen exposure or maternal cigarette smoking, that this fails to happen. The consequence is atopic disease, including asthma, characterised by inflammation with a Th2 phenotype. The use of immunomodulatory drugs20 to inhibit Th2 cell function may help to deviate the immune system away from a state where atopic disease and asthma are likely to develop. Such a strategy would require the identification of individuals at high risk and treatment in early life. There are significant ethical problems in human trials of such drugs in infants and young children, and the possible harmful effects of immune deviation are unknown.",

Some 70% of wheezing episodes in the first year are associated with viral respiratory infection21. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus and influenza B are the most frequently cultured22.

A total of 1246 new-born babies were recruited and studied in the first 6 years of life. Those children who suffered wheezing early in life before age 3 years could be divided into two groups. Persistent wheezers (those who still had episodes of wheezing at age 6 years) had higher levels of IgE, higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and a higher prevalence of maternal asthma. Transient wheezers (those without wheezing by age 6 years) were more likely to have small airways and impaired lung function at birth rather than factors associated with atopy. Differences were observed between these two groups in the response at the time of the first infective wheezing episode, which occurred at around 1 year and which was due to RSV in two-thirds of episodes. Persistent wheezers showed an increase in serum IgE not seen in transient wheezers. Eosinopenia was observed in transient wheezers and in children with lower respiratory tract illness without wheezing; eosinophil counts were maintained in persistent wheezers. Such episodes were also observed to be more severe in persistent wheezers. It has been suggested that persistent wheezers will, therefore, be over-represented in studies of children hospitalised with RSV infection, and this may explain why such studies show such a strong association with subsequent asthma27.",

Infants and young children who wheeze with acute respiratory virus infection appear to be at risk of wheeze later in childhood. This may be because such children have other factors such as small airways or deficient type 1 immunity which predispose them to wheeze during virus infections in both early and late childhood and may also predispose them to develop subsequent asthma. Roman29 has shown low IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 responses and significantly lower IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratios in PBMC from children hospitalised with RSV relative to PBMC from control children.

The disease syndrome following infection by virus is a consequence both of direct harmful effects of the virus itself and of immunopathology resulting from the host immune response, some of which may be unavoidable if the virus is to be eliminated. In an asthmatic individual, exacerbation may occur because of functional interaction between viral pathology and asthmatic pathology (i.e. through different mechanisms with the same end effect on function), or by sharing the same pathogenetic mechanism in an additive or even in a synergistic fashion. Pre-existing asthmatic inflammation might interfere with an effective antiviral response and thus allow the virus itself to cause increased airway damage. Alternatively, virus infection might increase the sensitivity of the asthmatic airway to trigger factors such as allergen exposure.

There are 102 serotypes of rhinovirus and no effective vaccine has been introduced. The influenza viruses display antigenic shift and drift. New vaccines must be developed every 2\u20133 years to cover the strains prevalent at the time. When a new pandemic strain arises, there is a delay before sufficient quantities of vaccine can be made available. Vaccination against RSV experienced a major setback in the 1960s when the use of formalin inactivated virus in young babies resulted in increased disease severity following subsequent virus infection70. Of vaccinated children, 80% required hospitalisation when subsequently infected with RSV, as compared to 5% of controls. The lungs of two vaccinated children who died contained eosinophilic infiltrates. It has been suggested that formalin inactivation may have modified epitopes within the RSV G and F surface glycoproteins, resulting in a modified immune response to subsequent infection with enhanced immunopathology71. Vaccinated individuals demonstrate a number of differences from individuals who have suffered natural RSV infection including a lack of specific mucosal antibodies and deficient neutralising and fusion-inhibiting serum antibodies72. There are also differences in the cell-mediated immune response with some vaccinated individuals demonstrating peripheral eosinophilia and exaggerated lymphocytic proliferative responses to RSV73. To protect against RSV infection, a successful vaccine would need to provide more effective protection than natural infection, which is itself frequently followed by re-infection74, and would have to be administered early in infancy to have an effect on infant bronchiolitis.",

Further work is needed to elucidate the important sites of interaction between the immunological networks of asthma and of virus infection.

The effects of corticosteroids are the result of actions at many points in various inflammatory cascades75.
