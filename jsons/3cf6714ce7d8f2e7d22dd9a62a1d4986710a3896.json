            "text": "The nucleolus is a nuclear domain involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes, as well as in many other important cellular regulatory activities, such as cell cycle control and mRNA processing. Many viruses, including herpesviruses, are known to exploit the nucleolar compartment during their replication cycle. In a previous study, we demonstrated the preferential targeting and accumulation of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL83 phosphoprotein (pp65) to the nucleolar compartment and, in particular, to the nucleolar matrix of lytically infected fibroblasts; such targeting was already evident at very early times after infection. Here we have investigated the possible effects of rRNA synthesis inhibition upon the development of HCMV lytic infection, by using either actinomycin D or cisplatin at low concentrations, that are known to selectively inhibit RNA polymerase I activity, whilst leaving RNA polymerase II function unaffected. Following the inhibition of rRNA synthesis by either of the agents used, we observed a significant redistribution of nucleolar proteins within the nucleoplasm and a simultaneous depletion of viral pp65 from the nucleolus; this effect was highly evident in both unextracted cells and in nuclear matrices in situ. Of particular interest, even a brief suppression of rRNA synthesis resulted in a very strong inhibition of the progression of HCMV infection, as was concluded from the absence of accumulation of HCMV major immediate-early proteins within the nucleus of infected cells. These data suggest that a functional relationship might exist between rRNA synthesis, pp65 localization to the nucleolar matrix and the normal development of HCMV lytic infection.",

In order to verify that these inhibitors exhibit similar effects in both non-infected and HCMV (AD169)-infected MRC5 human embryo fibroblasts, preliminary experiments were performed (Fig. 1) . Total RNA was extracted from both uninfected and infected cells at 2 h 30 min and 4 h 30 min time points post-infection (p.i.), following their incubation in the presence and absence of each of the two inhibitors. The extracted RNAs were reverse transcribed and subjected to a semi-quantitative PCR amplification (RT-PCR) in order to reveal a 293 bp rRNA fragment, corresponding to the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) (Fig. 1A ,A 0 ), and a 242 bp sequence from the third intron of b-actin pre-mRNA (Fig. 1B,B 0 ) .

Already at 2 h 30 min p.i., an accumulation of IE proteins within the nuclei of untreated cells was clearly visible, while in the nucleoplasm of treated cells only a few, discrete, bright spots were detected (Fig. 2 , panels a,c,e). Similar patterns were observed at 4 h 30 min p.i. (Fig. 2, panels b ,d,f), although in some cases the fluorescence signal was slightly increased in act-D-treated cells (arrows in panel d). These results suggest that the suppression of nucleolar gene transcription somehow blocks the development of HCMV infection. Importantly, this short-term inhibition of rRNA transcription does not result in the depletion of ribosomes within the cytoplasm, as demonstrated by a comparison of quantities of rRNA present in equivalent aliquots (see the GAPDH signal) of RNA extracted from uninfected and HCMV-infected control cells versus cells treated with rRNA transcription inhibitors (Fig. 3) . The RNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, and the intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis; then, data obtained in four independent experiments were submitted to statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA) (not shown), demonstrating that there are no significant differences in the amount of 18S and 28S rRNA under the experimental conditions used to suppress rRNA transcription.",

Figure 4 shows confocal microscopy images of double-labeled (nucleolar proteins: green; pp65: red) MRC5 fibroblasts after 45 min, 1 h 30 min and 2 h 30 min p.i., in the absence of rRNA transcription inhibitors (Fig. 4 , panels a-c; a 0 -c 0 ) and following treatment with either act-D (Fig. 4 , panels d-f; d 0 -f 0 ) or with cis-DDP (Fig. 4 , panels g-i; g 0 -i 0 ). A druginduced redistribution of nucleolar proteins was observed (Fig. 4 , panels d-f; g-i). It was a gradual process and the consequences of cell treatment with either act-D or cis-DDP were not exactly the same. In cells treated with act-D, although a significant level of nucleoplasmic redistribution of nucleolar proteins was observed, the nucleoli were still detectable even at 2 h 30 min p.i. (i.e., after 4 h treatment with act-D, since the cells had been pre-treated with the drug for 1 h 30 min before infection [see Materials and Methods Section for details]) (Fig. 4, panel f) . Different kinetics was observed for viral pp65: in cells treated with act-D, the viral protein was already fully displaced from the nucleolar compartment at 45 min p.i. (i.e., 2 h 15 min after the start of act-D treatment). In cells pretreated for 7 h with cis-DDP, most of the nucleolar proteins were already distributed throughout the entire nuclear space or otherwise displaced to the perinucleolar compartment at 45 min p.i. (Fig. 4 , panel g). Viral pp65 was similarly distributed at 45 min p.i. (Fig. 4 , panel g 0 ).",

In this case the time course kinetics has been shortened compared to that of unestracted nuclei, in order to analyze events occurring at the initial stages of HCMV infection. The nucleolar matrix was still detectable in cells pre-treated with act-D or cis-DDP before the beginning of virus infection (Fig. 5, panels d,g) , although significant redistribution of nucleolar proteins into nucleoplasm was quite evident (compare panels a,d,g in Fig. 5) . A similar pattern of nucleolar proteins staining was observed at 30 min p.i. (Fig. 5 , panels e,h). At this time point, pp65 colocalized with remnant nucleoli only in some of the infected and treated cells (white arrows, in panels e,e 0 ; h,h 0 ). At 45 min p.i. remnant nucleoli were practically absent in nuclear matrices of treated cells (Fig. 5, panels f,i) . Nevertheless, in several cases, a perinucleolar ring was still detectable; a similar pattern was observed for pp65 (Fig. 5 , panels f 0 ,i 0 ). Based on these results, we concluded that the existence of the nucleolar matrix drastically depends on the ongoing transcription of ribosomal genes. Furthermore, our results show that pp65 is initially targeted to and then released from the nucleolar matrix, before its complete disassembly.",

One of the best characterized nuclear compartments is the nucleolus, which is presently considered not only as ''the ribosome factory,'' but also as a multifunctional area that is involved in several cellular processes, including mRNA maturation and shuttling to cytoplasmic sites, control of the cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis [Pederson, 1998; Verdun, 2006] . It is also worth mentioning that some important nucleolar proteins with known DNA and/or RNA binding properties and regulatory functions in rRNA synthesis and cell cycle control, like nucleophosmin (B23) and nucleolin (C23) [Grinstein et al., 2006; Ugrinova et al., 2007] , have also been found to associate with the nuclear matrix; thus, they might be able to affect the whole system of nuclear compartmentalization [Mittnacht Fig. 2 .

            "text": "In this article, we show that early nucleolar compartmentalization of the major tegument protein ppUL83 (pp65) of the infecting HCMV [as previously described by Arcangeletti et al., 2003 ] is rapidly lost, or does not even become established, following the blockade of rRNA synthesis and delocalization of nucleolar proteins. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that rRNA synthesis blockade interferes with the development of HCMV lytic infection and that the latter is likely to stop at a very early stage, when the new formed IEp72 immediate-early protein is targeted to PML-bodies [Ahn and Hayward, 1997; Ishov et al., 1997; Arcangeletti et al., 2003] . Indeed, in cells treated with inhibitors of rRNA transcription, IE proteins are visible in a few speckles, possibly concomitant to colocalization with PML-bodies (Fig. 2) , but further accumulation of this virusspecific protein is blocked. It is important to note that a similar effect was observed when act-D or cis-DDP, that is, agents affecting nucleolar gene transcription by different mechanisms were used (act-D preferentially intercalates with GC-rich DNA sequences; cis-DDP directly interferes with the Upstream-Binding Factor). Taking into account the different nature of these drugs, it is highly unlikely that the observed inhibitory effects are due to their direct action on HCMV. It is also worth mentioning that the lack of IE proteins accumulation cannot be due to the shortage of ribosomes necessary for the synthesis of virus-specific proteins as the effect is observed after a relatively brief time of cell cultivation under conditions of rRNA transcription suppression. Furthermore, we present evidence indicating that this short-time inhibition of rRNA transcription does not result in an overall decrease of mature rRNA present in the cells (Fig. 3) . Thus, it appears evident that a regulatory pathway exists that blocks the progression of HCMV infection following the inhibition of rRNA synthesis. To this end, it is worth mentioning that many viruses are able to affect the activity of nucleolar genes through different mechanisms. For example, it has been reported that the HIV Tat protein localizes to nucleoli and interacts with fibrillarin, leading to an impairment of rRNA maturation, as well as a significant decrease in the number of cytoplasmic ribosomes, and directs the cell toward apoptosis [Ponti et al., 2008] . In addition, poliovirus induces rRNA synthesis shut-off [Banerjee et al., 2005] , whereas adenovirus infection leads to nucleolar dysfunction and disruption of rRNA processing and transport to the cytoplasm [Lawrence et al., 2006] . As for herpesviruses, infection by Herpes simplex virus type 1 was shown to induce an early cellular protein synthesis shut-off, while the synthesis of rRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as ribosome assembly, proceeded until late time points after infection. Nevertheless, ribosomes show several virusinduced modifications, including unusual patterns of phosphorylation and association between cellular and viral proteins [Simonin et al., 1997; Diaz et al., 2002] .",

Therefore, it is likely that the presence of HCMV components within the nucleolar Fig. 4 . Confocal microscopy analysis of nuclear and nucleolar patterns of pp65 viral protein in the presence of rRNA synthesis inhibitors in HCMVinfected MRC5 cells. MRC5 fibroblasts were grown on coverslips and infected with HCMV in the absence (''untreated'') or presence (''act-D''; ''cis-DDP'') of rRNA inhibitors (see Materials and Methods Section). Cells were fixed at 45 min, 1 h 30 min, and 2 h 30 min p.i. and simultaneously labeled with a monoclonal antibody against the 65-68 kDa HCMV lower matrix structural phosphoprotein (pp65) of HCMV and a human antiserum raised against a nucleolar antigen pool. The anti-pp65 antibody was revealed by Alexa-568conjugated anti-mouse IgG (red) and nucleolar proteins were stained by Alexa-488-conjugated anti-human IgG (green). Two equatorial confocal sections of the same fields are shown in separate panels: a-i, nucleolar proteins; a 0 -i 0 , pp65.

Although the function(s) of pp65 remain(s) to be fully understood, there are many observations suggesting that this protein is involved in the regulation of the initial events of viral replication. First of all, this hypothesis is supported by the previous observations made by ourselves and other groups regarding the nucleolar and nuclear matrix localization of the incoming and the de novo synthesized pp65 [Sanchez et al., 1998; Arcangeletti et al., 2003] . Furthermore, it has been reported that pp65 has a kinase activity [Britt and Auger, 1986; Somogyi et al., 1990] and interacts with other viral and/or cellular kinases [Gallina et al., 1999; Kamil and Coen, 2007] . Finally, Dal Monte and collaborators found that HCMV replication in vitro is suppressed in the absence of a functional pp65 [Dal Monte et al., 1996] .",

In this respect it might be important that control of the cell cycle of mammalian cells is connected to the biogenesis of ribosomes at the nucleolar level [Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003; Pliss et al., 2005] . During G1, an increase in rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly are necessary to satisfy an increased need of newly synthesized proteins at the beginning of the S phase. On the other hand, it is known that HCMV is able to modify the normal progression of the cell cycle to its own benefit, by blocking cycling cells in G1 and G1/S [Bain and Sinclair, 2007] . Nucleolar components control the abovementioned phases, mostly by modulating phosphorylation levels of transcription factors that can influence their interaction with and activation of polymerase I transcription machinery [Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005] . Thus, it is likely that the targeting to the nucleolus of the incoming pp65, possessing a kinase activity, represents a crucial strategy adopted by HCMV to take over the regulatory systems controlling the cell cycle progression in order to ensure the correct development of the lytic program.",

Confocal microscopy analysis of the nuclear matrix-associated pp65 and nucleolar proteins at different times after HCMV infection in MRC5 cells untreated or treated with rRNA synthesis inhibitors. MRC5 fibroblasts grown on coverslips were untreated or pre-treated with act-D or cis-DDP, then leaved uninfected or infected with HCMV for 30 and 45 min in the absence or presence of the above-mentioned rRNA inhibitors. Uninfected and virus-infected cells were extracted to obtain in situ nuclear matrices, then fixed and simultaneously labeled with the antibodies described in the legend to Figure 4 . Uninfected cells: one representative confocal section is shown for panels a,d,g (nucleolar proteins). Infected cells: two equatorial confocal sections of the same fields are shown in separate panels; b,c,e,f,h,i, nucleolar proteins; b 0 ,c 0 ,e 0 ,f 0 ,h 0 ,i 0 , pp65.

Confocal microscopy analysis of the nuclear matrix-associated pp65 and nucleolar proteins at different times after HCMV infection in MRC5 cells untreated or treated with rRNA synthesis inhibitors. MRC5 fibroblasts grown on coverslips were untreated or pre-treated with act-D or cis-DDP, then leaved uninfected or infected with HCMV for 30 and 45 min in the absence or presence of the above-mentioned rRNA inhibitors. Uninfected and virus-infected cells were extracted to obtain in situ nuclear matrices, then fixed and simultaneously labeled with the antibodies described in the legend to Figure 4. Uninfected cells: one representative confocal section is shown for panels a,d,g (nucleolar proteins). Infected cells: two equatorial confocal sections of the same fields are shown in separate panels; b,c,e,f,h,i, nucleolar proteins; b 0 ,c 0 ,e 0 ,f 0 ,h 0 ,i 0 , pp65.
