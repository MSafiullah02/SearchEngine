Ten house flies were fed at each time point. The house flies that were fed on feces taken at 1 d p.i. were negative, but all flies that were fed on feces of the infected chickens at 2 and 3 d p.i. were REV-PCR positive. These results indicated that virus was shed on day 2 p.i., and it could be transferred to the flies that were in contact with these chickens.",

Positive insects were not found near REV antibody-positive flocks, indicating that the virus load or infection rates were too low to be transmitted mechanically by these insects. It seems, therefore, that under conditions of natural infection in commercial flocks, the insects may not be a major risk factor for infection with REV. However, in previous studies hematophagous arthropods have been implicated in the horizontal dissemination of REV in commercial flocks (Motha et al. 1984; Thompson et al. 1968, 1971) because REV was detected and monitored in Israel in previous years (Davidson and Malkinson 1997), we sought to study the possible involvement of insects in several controlled experiments.",

Rapid inactivation of REV in engorged mosquitoes seems to be related to digestion of the virus in the midgut, indicating probably that these insects lack receptors for viral attachment and midgut infection. Mosquitoes may harbor REV for short time periods and could transmit REV mechanically for short periods if a bloodmeal is shared between infected and uninfected birds. These data and that no REV was detected in the trapped insects indicate that mosquitoes in particular, and probably other insects, are not infected with REV, and certainly the virus is not replicating in the insects, but is transmitted mechanically.",

Because we showed the transmission of the virus from infected chicken to the house flies, the partial cycle was achieved, thus contributing to the knowledge on the avenues of REV horizontal spread in commercial flocks.",
