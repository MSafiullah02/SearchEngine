Although most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or develop mild to moderate symptoms, a subset of patients develop pneumonia and severe dyspnea, and require intensive care. Because acute respiratory syndrome is the hallmark feature of severe COVID-19, most initial studies on COVID-19 have focused on its impact on the respiratory system. However, accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 also infects other organs and can affect various body systems. As many scientists have already noted, these emerging findings call for investigations into the short-and long-term consequences of COVID-19 beyond the respiratory system. In the next sections we briefly discuss recent observations suggesting an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological complications. We place these findings in the context of previous studies demonstrating that various viruses, including CoVs, can have effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Lastly, we highlight the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infection could promote or enhance susceptibility to other forms of CNS insults that may lead to neurological syndromes. Given scope limitations, we offer only a sample of the substantial literature on the CNS impact of viral infection, with the purpose of underscoring some of the sequelae and mechanisms that may be involved in the context of COVID-19, and that require further investigation.",

For example, one study reported hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy in~20% of 113 deceased patients with COVID-19 [2] . A recent study evaluated 214 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from China and found that 36% had neurological manifestations, 46 including acute cerebrovascular disease and impaired consciousness [3] ; a case 48 of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing enceph-49 alopathy has also been reported [4] . . Of note, early preclinical 101 studies showed that intranasal/intraocular 102 inoculation in non-human primates [12] 103 led to detection of CoV RNA or antigen 104 in the brain, and post-mortem analyses 105 indicated the presence of brain pathology, 106 including inflammation and white matter 107 edema.

Large 140 numbers of young adults worldwide are 141 now infected, or will be infected in the 142 near future, by SARS-CoV-2. For some, the severity of the disease will require hospitalization, opening up the possibility of detailed medical examination which could be leveraged for longitudinal studies, as discussed later. Literature on previously studied viruses raises the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the CNS. The inflammatory response elicited in acute or chronic infection may trigger or accelerate early and subclinical mechanisms that underlie the earliest stages of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, because findings in neurodegenerative diseases and other viral infections suggest that systemic inflammatory mediators may access the CNS and trigger damage via impaired BBB function, systemic inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may further contribute to neuroinflammatory processes and increase susceptibility to neurological syndromes. CNS infections may thus promote the development of neurodegenerative disease in individuals already at risk. There is an urgent need for longitudinal studies to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to enhanced incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in infected individuals (Box 1).",
