Infected persons are most contagious during the period of peak symptoms. The attack rate in children is 14% to 40% yearly and more than 30% in preschool age children. Children frequently infect their families. In the United States, annual averages of 94 735 (range, 18 908-193 561) primary and 133 900 (30 757-271 529) \u201cany listed pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations\u201d were associated with influenza virus infections.

Significant numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States occur among the elderly, and the numbers of these hospitalizations have increased substantially over the last 2 decades due in part to the aging of the population. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates increased annually from 1979-1980 to 2000-2001 among persons aged 50 through 85 years and older.10 Influenza and pneumonia comprise the sixth leading cause of death in the United States overall and the fifth leading cause among adults 65 years and older. In the 1990s, influenza-related deaths increased to about 36 000 per year. The number of deaths can increase to 40 000 during epidemics.11\n",

A study analyzed monthly the mortality in the United States during the period 1959 to 1999 for 4 major disease classes. The authors isolated the seasonal component of mortality by removing trends and standardizing the time series. Peak months of mortality for ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus coincided appropriately with peaks in pneumonia and influenza. The magnitude of the seasonal component was highly correlated with traditional measures of excess mortality and was significantly larger in seasons dominated by influenza A(H2N2) and A(H3N2) viruses than in seasons dominated by A(H1N1) or B viruses. There was an age shift in mortality during and after the 1968 or 1969 pandemic in each disease class, with features specific to influenza A(H3N2). These findings suggest that the cause of the winter increase in US mortality is singular and probably influenza. Weather and other factors may determine the timing and modulate the magnitude of the winter-season increase in mortality, but the primary determinant appears to be the influenza virus.12\n",

A study by Simonsen et al13 could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group. They showed that for people aged 65 to 74 years, excess mortality rates in A(H3N2)-dominated seasons fell between 1968 and the early 1980s but remained approximately constant thereafter. For persons 85 years or older, the mortality rate remained flat throughout. Excess mortality in A(H1N1) and B seasons did not change. All-cause excess mortality for persons 65 years or older never exceeded 10% of all winter deaths. The authors attributed the decline in influenza-related mortality among people aged 65 to 74 years in the decade after the 1968 pandemic to the acquisition of immunity to the emerging A(H3N2) virus. They concluded that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit.13 The study has provoked starkly different reactions and certainly indicates that there is room for improvement of influenza vaccines.14 A statement by CDC and National Institutes of Health clarifies that the Simonsen study in no way implies that the elderly should not receive influenza vaccine. Rather, the study concludes that the vaccine may prevent fewer deaths among the elderly than previous studies would have suggested. Vaccination remains the best available protection from influenza for people 65 years and older. It may be beneficial to vaccinate larger numbers of healthy persons, including children, to prevent transmission of influenza viruses to high-risk persons such as the elderly (CDC.

Altogether, 18 cases (6 fatal) were reported in the first known instance of human infection with this virus (WHO. H5N1 avian influenza: timeline. Available at: www.who.int). Since 1997, there have been many incidents of transmission of avian influenza virus to humans.5 Increased surveillance may have increased the detection rate, but there is support for the notion that H9N2 influenza virus was not found in Asia in domestic chickens or in humans before the mid-1980s. The spread of H5N1 influenza virus throughout Asia in 2004 is undoubtedly a novel event. The H5N1 virus that infected humans in 1997 acquired all 8 gene segments from Eurasian avian sources. The virus was soon replaced by different genotypes that were highly pathogenic in chickens but not in ducks. These viruses were again replaced by additional genotypes in 2002. The most remarkable property of the H5N1 genotype from late 2002 was its high pathogenicity for ducks and other aquatic birds. In early February 2003, H5N1 virus reemerged in a family in Hong Kong. The strain was antigenically and molecularly similar to the antigenically drifted strain that was highly pathogenic for ducks and chickens.15 As of December 23, 2005, cumulative numbers of confirmed human cases and deaths from avian influenza A(H5N1) since 2003 are 93 and 42 from Vietnam, 22 and 14 from Thailand, 16 and 11 from Indonesia, 6 and 2 from China, and 4 and 4 from Cambodia (www.who.int).",

The molecular basis of influenza virus transmissibility remains unresolved.15 Like the 1918 virus, H5N1 influenza has unusually high virulence. Although the 2 viruses differ in their transmissibility among humans, there is concern that currently circulating H5N1 viruses will evolve into a pandemic strain by adapting to humans through genetic mutation or reassortment with human influenza strains. Fortunately, there has been no direct evidence of efficient poultry-to-human or human-to-human transmission to date.16 Nevertheless, probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A(H5N1) was reported. The index patient was an 11-year-old girl who lived with her aunt. She became ill 3 to 4 days after her last exposure to dying household chickens. Her mother came from a distant city to care for her in the hospital, had no recognized exposure to poultry, and died from pneumonia after providing 16 to 18 hours of unprotected nursing care. The aunt also provided unprotected nursing care; she had fever 5 days after the mother first had fever, followed by pneumonia 7 days later. Autopsy tissue from the mother and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from the aunt were positive for influenza A(H5N1) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. No additional chains of transmission were identified, and sequencing of the viral genes identified no change in the receptor-binding site of hemagglutinin or other key features of the virus. The sequences of all 8 viral gene segments clustered closely with other H5N1 sequences from recent avian isolates in Thailand. It was concluded that the disease in the mother and aunt probably resulted from person-to-person transmission of this lethal avian influenza virus during unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient.17, 18 However, a study from Vietnam showed a lack of H5N1 avian influenza transmission to hospital employees.19\n",

To evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures, a study quantified between-flock transmission characteristics of the virus in 2 affected areas. The control measures markedly reduced the transmission of the virus. The study suggests that the containment of the epidemic was probably due to the reduction in the number of susceptible flocks by complete depopulation of the infected areas rather than to the reduction of the transmission by the other control measures.21 A recent report described the occurrence of infection with the virus in household contacts of human index cases, in the absence of contact with infected poultry, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus during the 2003 poultry epidemic.22, 23 In 2004, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) occurred in poultry in British Columbia, Canada.

It mutates rapidly and has a known propensity to acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its ability to cause severe disease in humans has now been documented. In addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that isolates of this virus have a high pathogenicity and can cause severe disease in humans. Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days, orally and in feces, thus, facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds. H5N1 variants demonstrated a capacity to directly infect humans in 1997, and have done so again in Vietnam and other countries since 2003. The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans. If more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also increases that humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influenza strains, could serve as the \u201cmixing vessel\u201d for the emergence of a novel subtype with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic.2\n",

If this series of events over the last hundred years reflects a pattern, recycling of subtypes would be the norm in the human population, and the possibility for the emergence of new pandemics would be limited. On the other hand, if any subtype is able to thrive in the human population, a greater number of possibilities for novel pandemic strains would exist. Although H5N1 avian viruses were shown to cause death in humans, none of these strains were easily transmitted from human to human. Also, none of the H5N1 strains showed evidence of having acquired genes from circulating human influenza viruses. Whether this is a necessary requirement for a pandemic strain to be successful is not known. It would seem probable that such a reassortment event between an avian and a human influenza virus could have happened many times over, either in humans or in animals. It may be possible that infections of humans by avian influenza viruses have been ongoing for decades, and it is only the reporting that has improved in recent years. If this were the case, the present emphasis on the imminent pandemic outbreak would not be justified.25 However, the precursor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013associated coronavirus has been shown to have repeatedly crossed species barriers, probably for many years, before it finally acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission, and its pathogenicity to humans was not attenuated.26 Because the H5N1 virus continues to evolve and spread, with additional human infections occurring in many countries, we cannot afford simply to hope that human-to-human spread of the virus does not happen, and that if it does, the pathogenicity of the virus will attenuate.8 What is warranted and where there is little or no disagreement among scientists is a continued surveillance of influenza viruses. Stockpiling of antiviral drugs and the development of new vaccines are highly recommended to be better prepared for a potential pandemic outbreak.25\n",

Multiple viral antigens and multiple immune effector mechanisms can participate. Mucosal vaccination induces different immune responses than systemic vaccination and is more effective at inducing broad cross-protection to multiple influenza A subtypes in animals. Broad cross-protection in humans is of unclear potency and duration, but epidemiological data suggest that it may have an impact. A variety of vaccines may induce broad cross-protection if administered appropriately. Imperfect vaccine protection is worth having, especially for a virus causing an acute (not latent) infection. It could provide a first line of pandemic defense to be augmented by subtype- or strain-specific vaccines when available.28 More recent articles also reviewed and discussed the development of cross-protective vaccines.29, 30, 31, 32\n",

On April 1, 2005, the US government issued a directive allowing authorities to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza when arriving in the United States aboard an international flight.

Virus was recovered from the blood within 24 hours after challenge and with decreasing frequency thereafter for the 3 days tested. Viremia preceded virus shedding from the nose and the onset of illness. Symptoms of infection were mild in 3 of the subjects with viremia, and the fourth remained completely asymptomatic. Proof of the human origin of the viruses recovered was gained by repeated reisolation from the original specimens, and infection was confirmed serologically. The virus isolates were confirmed as influenza A2 with properties similar to those of the challenge strain. It was concluded that influenza virus infections may cause viremia during an asymptomatic incubation period, and that the course of viremic infection is not necessarily one of severe illness.37 However, in the discussion after the report, several other investigators indicated that they conducted similar experiments but were unable to obtain the same results.",

Moreover, SARS's severe symptoms helped identify patients, whereas influenza can be as mild as the sniffles. The only exception may be very early on. When the virus is still struggling to replicate among humans, surveillance and quarantine, perhaps helped by aggressive use of antiviral drugs, might nip a pandemic in the bud\u2014which is why WHO is exploring a plan to ship antivirals to the cradle of a potential pandemic.

A range of facility types and sizes were represented in the sample. Results indicate that HCWs were most able to report to work for a mass casualty incident (83%), environmental disaster (81%), and chemical event (71%), and least able to report during a smallpox epidemic (69%), radiologic event (64%), SARS outbreak (64%), or severe snowstorm (49%). In terms of willingness, HCWs were most willing to report during snowstorm (80%), mass casualty incident (86%), and environmental disaster (84%), and least willing during SARS outbreak (48%), radiologic event (57%), smallpox epidemic (61%), and chemical event (68%). Barriers to ability included transportation problems, childcare, eldercare, and pet care obligations. Barriers to willingness included fear and concern for family and self and personal health problems. The findings were consistent for all types of facilities.45\n",

Most of our blood donors and staff members are 20- to 64-year olds; illness with 0- to 19-year olds and 65 years or older may also impact on those of 20- to 64-year olds because they may need to care for those of 0 to 19 or 65 years or older in their families who are ill. Furthermore, what could be important but has not yet been fully assessed is the number of potential blood donors and even some staff members who would be afraid of coming out to blood centers to donate blood or perform blood collection or processing functions. Many people could be ordered to stay home because of potential exposure to the infection.",

During a pandemic, there could be reduced admissions to hospitals and therefore reduced number of patients who may need transfusion. Furthermore, there could be reduction in transfusion even for existing patients because of reduced hospital staff capacity or simply for contingency purposes. It will be important to know whether reduced demand in hospitals will out- or underperform reduced collection and delivery of blood products. Another important aspect of the potential impact of a pandemic on blood demand is the likely difference for different products such as whole blood vs platelets. Although the need for whole blood or plasma may decrease because of cancelled operations, the need for platelets may be unaffected or affected to a lesser extent.",
