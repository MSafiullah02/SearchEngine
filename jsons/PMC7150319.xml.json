Infection refers to the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues and may occur with or without apparent disease. Disease refers to interruption or deviation from normal structure and function of any tissue, organ or system. Many of the infections with which we are concerned may not cause discernable disease in many strains of mice. However, they may cause inapparent or subclinical changes that can interfere with research. Such interference often remains undetected, and therefore modified results may be obtained and published.",

There is no doubt that research complications due to overt infectious disease are significant and that animals with clinical signs of disease should not be used for scientific experiments. But clinically inapparent infections may also have severe effects on animal experiments. There are numerous examples of influences of microorganisms on host physiology and hence of the interference of inapparent infections with the results of animal experiments. Many microorganisms have the potential to induce activation or suppression of the immune system, or both at the same time but on different parts of the immune system, regardless of the level of pathogenicity. All infections, apparent or inapparent, are likely to increase interindividual variability and hence result in increased numbers of animals necessary to obtain reliable results. Microorganisms, in particular viruses, present in an animal may contaminate biological materials such as sera, cells or tumours [1], [2]. This may interfere with in vitro experiments conducted with such materials and may also lead to contamination of animals [3]. Mouse antibody production (MAP) testing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of biologics to be inoculated into mice is an important component of a disease prevention programme. Finally, latent infections may be activated by environmental factors, by experimental procedures, or by the combination and interaction between various microorganisms. For all these reasons, prevention of infection, not merely prevention of clinical disease, is essential.",

            "text": "Serology is the primary means of testing mouse colonies for exposure to viruses, largely because serological tests are sensitive and specific, are relatively inexpensive and allow screening for a multitude of agents with one serum sample. They are also employed to monitor biological materials for viral contamination using the MAP test. Serological tests detect specific antibodies, usually immunoglobulin G (IgG), produced by the host against the virus and do not actually test for the presence of the virus. An animal may have been infected, mounted an effective antibody response and cleared the virus, but remains seropositive for weeks or months or for ever, even though it is no longer infected or shedding the agent. Active infection can only be detected by using direct detection methods such as virus isolation, electron microscopy or PCR. Meanwhile, PCR assays have been established for the detection of almost every agent of interest. They are highly sensitive and, depending on the demands, they can be designed to broadly detect all members of a genus or only one species. However, good timing and selection of the appropriate specimen is critical for establishing the diagnosis. In practice, combinations of diagnostic tests are often necessary, including the use of sentinel animals or immunosuppression to get clear aetiological results or to avoid consequences from false-positive results.",

            "text": "Reports on the prevalence of viral infections in laboratory mice throughout the world have been published frequently. In general, the microbiological quality of laboratory mice has constantly improved during the last decades, and several agents (e.g. herpesviruses and polyomaviruses) have been essentially eliminated from contemporary colonies due to advances in diagnostic methodologies and modern husbandry and rederivation practices [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. They may, however, reappear, since most have been retained or are still being used experimentally. Furthermore, the general trend towards better microbiological quality is challenged by the increasing reliance of biomedical research on genetically modified and immunodeficient mice, whose responses to infection and disease can be unpredictable. Increasing numbers of scientists are creating genetically modified mice, with minimal or no awareness of infectious disease issues. As a consequence, these animals are more frequently infected than \u2018standard\u2019 strains of mice coming from commercial breeders, and available information on their health status is often insufficient. Frequently they are exchanged between laboratories, which amplifies the risk of introducing infections from a range of animal facilities. Breeding cessation strategies that have been reported to eliminate viruses from immunocompetent mouse colonies may prove to be costly and ineffective in genetically modified colonies of uncertain or incompetent immune status. It must also be expected that new agents will be detected, although only occasionally. Infections therefore remain a threat to biomedical research, and users of laboratory mice must be cognizant of infectious agents and the complications they can cause.",

It persists in the salivary glands (particularly in the submaxillary glands) and also in other organs [22], [23], [24]. The virus can be cultured in mouse fibroblast lines like 3T3 cells, but primary mouse embryo fibroblasts are more sensitive to infection and produce higher virus titres. However, passage in cell culture results in its attenuation. To maintain virulence, the virus is best propagated by salivary gland passages of sublethal virus doses in weanling mice of a susceptible strain (e.g. BALB/c) [25].",

These results are very difficult to summarize because the outcome of experimental infection in laboratory mice depends on various factors such as mouse strain and age, virus strain and passage history [26], virus dose and route of inoculation [24]. In general, newborn mice are most susceptible to clinical disease and to lethal infection and develop higher levels of resistance with increasing age. Infection of neonates leads to abnormal brain development [27], [28]. Virus replication is observed in newborn mice in many tissues and appears in the salivary glands towards the end of the first week of infection when virus concentrations in liver and spleen have already declined. Resistance develops rapidly after weaning between days 21 and 28 of age. Experimental infection of adult mice results in mortality only in susceptible strains and only if high doses are administered. Not even intravenous or intraperitoneal injections of adult mice usually produce signs of illness in resistant strains [29]. Mice of the H-2b (e.g. C57BL/6) and H-2d (e.g. BALB/c) haplotype are more sensitive to experimental infection than are mice of the H-2k haplotype (e.g. C3H), which are approximately 10-fold more resistant to mortality than those of the b or d haplotype [24].",

Immunodeficient mice lacking functional T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, such as Foxn1nu and Lystbg mice are more susceptible than are immunocompetent animals. Experimental infection in Prkdcscid mice causes severe disease or is lethal, with necrosis in spleen, liver and other organs, and multinucleate syncythia with inclusion bodies in the liver [32]. Similarly to AIDS patients infected with human cytomegalovirus, athymic Foxn1nu mice experimentally infected with MCMV-1 also develop adrenal necrosis [33]. The virus also replicates in the lungs, leading to pneumonitis, whereas replication and disease are not seen in heterozygous (Foxn1nu/\n+) littermates [34].

If neonatal infection is suspected, homogenates of salivary glands or other materials can be inoculated into pathogen-free newborn mice followed by gross and histological examination of thymus, lymph nodes and spleens for lymphoid necrosis [49].

Another recent and well-documented case of mousepox was published by Lipman et al. [3]. Few additional but unpublished cases of ectromelia have been observed since then; the latest report of an outbreak was published in 2009 [74].

Mousepox may occur as a rapidly spreading outbreak with acute disease and deaths, or may be inconspicuous with slow spreading and mild clinical signs and may therefore be very difficult to diagnose [81]. The mortality rate can be very low in populations in which the virus has been present for long periods. The infection usually takes one of three clinical courses: acute asymptomatic infection, acute lethal infection (systemic form) or subacute to chronic infection (cutaneous form) [8], [81], [82], [83]. The systemic or visceral form is characterized clinically by facial oedema, conjunctivitis, multisystemic necrosis and usually high mortality. This form is less contagious than the cutaneous form because the animals die before there is virus shedding. The cutaneous form is characterized by typical dermal lesions and variable mortality. The outcome of infection depends on many factors including strain and dose of virus; route of viral entry; strain, age, and sex of mouse; husbandry methods and duration of infection in the colony. While all mouse strains seem to be susceptible to infection with ECTV, clinical signs and mortality are strain-dependent [84], [85], [86]. Acute lethal (systemic) infection occurs in highly susceptible inbred strains such as DBA/1, DBA/2, BALB/c, A and C3H/HeJ. Immunodeficient mice may also be very susceptible [87]. Outbreaks among susceptible mice can be explosive, with variable morbidity and high mortality (>80%). Clinical disease may not be evident in resistant strains such as C57BL/6 and AKR, and the virus can be endemic in a population for long periods before being recognized. Furthermore, females seem to be more resistant to disease than males, at least in certain strains of mice [84], [85]. Killer cells are necessary to control mousepox infections [88]. Mice that are resistant to mousepox may lose their resistance with increasing age, most likely due to the decreased number and activity of NK cells [89].",

The genetic loci considered to be important include H2Db (termed Rmp3, resistance to mousepox), on chromosome 17 [90]; the C5 genes (Rmp2, on chromosome 2); Rmp1, localized to a region on chromosome 6 encoding the NK cell receptor NKR-P1 alloantigens [91]; the nitric oxide synthase 2 locus on chromosome 11 [92]; and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 locus on chromosome 10 [93]. Mousepox infections are controlled for several days during the initial course of infection by the complement system until the adaptive immune system can react. Loss of the complement system results in lethal infection [94]. Clearance of the virus by the immune system is dependent upon the effector functions of CD8+ T cells while NK cells, CD4+ T cells and macrophages are necessary for the generation of an optimal response [95], [96]. T- and B-cell interactions and antibodies play a central role during recovery from a secondary infection [97].",

This sequence takes approximately 1 week. Many animals die at the end of this stage without premonitory signs of illness; others develop varying clinical signs including ruffled fur, hunched posture, swelling of the face or extremities, conjunctivitis and skin lesions (papules, erosions or encrustations mainly on ears, feet and tail; Figure 3.2.1\n). Necrotic amputation of limbs and tails can sometimes be seen in mice that survive the acute phase, hence the original name of the disease: \u2018ectromelia\u2019 means absent or short limbs (Figure 3.2.2\n).",

            "text": "Various tests have been applied for the diagnosis of ectromelia. Previous epidemics were difficult to deal with because of limited published data and information on the biology of the virus and the lack of specific and sensitive assays [101]. In the 1950s, diagnosis relied on clinical signs, histopathology and animal passages of tissues from moribund and dead animals. Culture of the virus on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs was also used. Serology is currently the primary means of routine health surveillance for testing mouse colonies for exposure to ECTV. The methods of choice are MFIA, ELISA and IFA; they are more sensitive and specific than the previously used haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay [41], [102], [103]. Serological tests based on virus particles detect antibodies to orthopoxviruses and do not distinguish between ECTV and vaccinia virus or other orthopoxviruses, respectively. Vaccinia virus is commonly used as an antigen for serological testing to avoid the risk of infection for mice. Thus, false-positive serological reactions may be found after experimental administration of replication-competent vaccinia virus. It has been shown that even cage contact sentinels may develop antibodies, and vaccinia virus leading to seroconversion may even be transmitted by dirty bedding [104]. Confirmation of positive serological results is important before action is taken because vaccinia virus is increasingly prevalent in animal facilities as a research tool (e.g. for vaccination or gene therapy). As observed in different outbreaks, serological testing is of little value in the initial stages of the disease. For example, in the outbreak described by Dick et al. [81] depopulation was nearly completed before serological confirmation was possible. For this reason, negative serological results should be confirmed by direct detection methods (PCR, immunohistochemistry, virus isolation) or by histopathology, especially when clinical signs suggestive of mousepox are observed. PCR assays to detect different genes of poxviruses in infected tissues have been used [3], [81], [105]. Other PCR tests which were developed to detect smallpox virus have also been shown to detect ectromelia virus and can be used as well [106], [107].",

            "text": "The key to prevention and control of mousepox is early detection of infected mice and contaminated biological materials. All institutions that must introduce mice from other than commercial barrier facilities should have a health surveillance programme and test incoming mice. Perhaps even more important than living animals are samples from mice (tumours, sera, tissues). The virus replicates in lymphoma and hybridoma cell lines [108], and such cells or material derived from them may therefore be a vehicle for inadvertent transfer between laboratories. The last three published outbreaks of ectromelia were introduced into the facilities by mouse serum [3], [74], [81]. Lipman et al. [3] found that the contaminated serum originated from a pooled lot of 43 L that had been imported from China, but in both other cases, serum was obtained from animals in the USA. Because mouse serum is commonly sold to the end user in small aliquots (a few millilitres), it has to be expected that aliquots of the contaminated lot may still be stored in freezers. These published cases of ectromelia outbreaks provide excellent examples of why testing should be performed on all biological materials to be inoculated into mice. In the case of ectromelia virus it was shown that PCR is more sensitive, and MAP testing failed to detect contamination [74].",

While culling of entire mouse colonies is the safest method for eradication of mousepox, it is not a satisfactory method because of the uniqueness of numerous lines of genetically modified animals housed in many facilities. Several studies indicate that mousepox is not highly contagious [75], [84], [99] and that it may be self-limiting when adequate husbandry methods are applied. Therefore, strict quarantine procedures along with cessation of breeding (to permit resolution of infection) and frequent monitoring, with removal of clinically sick and seropositive animals, are a potential alternative. The period from the last births until the first matings after cessation of breeding should be at least 6 weeks [99]. Sequential testing of immunocompetent contact sentinels for seroconversion should be employed with this option.\n",

It has later been shown to be a frequent contaminant of transplantable tumours [1]. Natural infection of mice is subclinical, and gross lesions including tumours are usually not found. Tumour formation occurs when mice are experimentally infected at a young age or when inoculated with high virus doses. Development of tumours may be preceded by multifocal necrosis and mortality during the viraemic stage [36]. Parotid, salivary gland and mammary tumours are common, and sarcomas or carcinomas of kidney, subcutis, adrenal glands, bone, cartilage, teeth, blood vessels and thyroid also occur. Virus strains vary with regard to the tumour types or lesions that they induce, and mouse strains vary in their susceptibility to different tumour types. Those of C57BL and C57BR/cd lineage are considered to be the most resistant strains; athymic Foxn1nu mice are considered to be most susceptible; C3H mice are particularly susceptible to adrenal tumours and A mice tend to develop bone tumours. Immunosuppression or inoculation into immunodeficient strains (e.g. Foxn1nu) also supports the growth of tumours. On the other hand, experimental infection of adult immunocompetent mice does not result in tumour formation because the immune response suppresses tumour growth, and newborn immunocompetent mice develop runting only if inoculated with high virus doses [154].",

The virus is shed in faeces and in all body fluids, and transmission occurs rapidly by direct contact between animals, but also between cages in a room. Further, intrauterine transmission has been documented after experimental infection [156]. MPyV persists in all organs in Prkdcscid mice while viral DNA is detectable in immunocompetent mice after experimental infection for only a limited period of about 4 weeks [157]. However, virus may persist and can be reactivated by prolonged immunosuppression [158] or during pregnancy, at least in young mice [159]. It has been shown that interferon-gamma is an important factor of the host defence against tumour formation and MPyV infection [160]. Biological materials of mouse origin are likely to be the most common source of contamination of laboratory mice, emphasizing the importance of MAP or PCR screening of biological materials to be inoculated into mice.",

Neither the virion ELISA nor HI is a practical screening test for MPV because they require large quantities of purified MPV, which is difficult to obtain. Diagnosis of MPV infections has long been made on the basis of an MVM HI-negative result coupled with an MVM IFA-positive result. IFA provides the opportunity to detect both serogroup-specific VP proteins as well as NS proteins that are conserved among mouse parvoviruses. A generic rodent parvovirus ELISA using a recombinant NS-1 protein as antigen has been developed [184], but MPV IFA and MPV HI assays are more sensitive techniques than the NS-1 ELISA and the MVM IFA [181]. In contrast, ELISA tests that use recombinant VP-2 provide sensitive and serogroup-specific assays for the diagnosis of MPV infections in mice [176], [185], although considerable cross-reactivity with heterologous capsid antigens exists [173]. Nevertheless, when using the ELISA technique, one needs to consider that MPV-2 may not consistently be detected by MPV-1 VP-2 ELISA [168], [173], especially when antibody titres are low (own observations). Therefore, ELISAs using MPV-2 VP-2 and MPV-3 VP-2 antigens are also used for diagnostics. As parvovirus diagnostics using recombinant assays should be based on a combination of antigens, bead-based mulitplex assays are a convenient extension of traditional ELISA, allowing the use of multiple antigens simultaneously.",

Both variants have distinct cell tropisms in vivo and in vitro. MVMp infects fibroblast cell lines and does not cause clinical disease [195], [196]. MVMi grows lytically in T cells and inhibits various functions mediated by these cells in vitro. Both strains are apathogenic for adult mice, but the immunosuppressive variant is more pathogenic for neonatal mice than is MVMp. A third strain, the Cutter strain MVMc, was isolated from BHK-21 cells [172].

Kilham and Margolis [200] observed mild growth retardation a few days after experimental infection of neonatal mice with MVMp. Studies of transplacental infection yielded no pathological findings in mice [201]. The immunosuppressive variant, but not the prototype strain, is able to produce a runting syndrome after experimental infection of newborn mice [195]. Depending on the host genotype, experimental infections of fetal and neonatal mice with MVMi produce various clinical presentations and lesions. Infection in C57BL/6 mice is asymptomatic, but the virus causes lethal infections with intestinal haemorrhage in DBA/2 mice. Infection of strains such as BALB/c, CBA, C3H/He and SJL is also lethal and mice have renal papillary haemorrhage [196]. The MVMi also infects haematopoietic stem cells and mediates an acute myelosuppression [202], [203]. Because of its dependence on mitotically active tissues, the fetus is at particular risk for damage by parvoviruses. MVM and other parvoviruses may have severe teratogenic effects and cause fetal and neonatal abnormalities by destroying rapidly dividing cell populations, often resulting in fetal death. Adult Prkdcscid mice develop an acute leukopenia 1 month after experimental infection with MVMi and die within 3 months. The virus persists lifelong in the bone marrow of these mice [204]. During a natural concurrent outbreak of MVMm and MPV, a runting syndrome with lymphohistiocytic renal inflammation and inclusion bodies in cells resembling splenic haematopoietic progenitor cells was reported in B-cell (Ighm)-deficient mice [205].",

            "text": "Routine health surveillance is usually conducted by serological methods. Unlike MPV, MVM can easily be cultured in cell lines so that antigen production for HI and ELISA (using whole purified virions) is easy. HI is a highly specific diagnostic test whereas IFA always exhibits some degree of cross-reactivity with MPV and other closely related parvoviruses. ELISA is probably the most frequently used test, but depending on the purity of the antigen preparation, cross-reactions with MPV may occur due to contamination with non-structural proteins that are common to both viruses. This problem can be avoided by the use of recombinant VP-2 antigen [176]. By using serological methods, one needs to consider that the mouse strain has a considerable effect on seroconversion so that an antibody response might not be detectable despite infection; while C57BL/6J mice showed good antibody response, seroconversion was observed only in some BALB/c, AKR/N, DBA/2J, FVB/N and C3H/HeN, but not in NMRI and ICR mice upon contact exposure to MVMi-inoculated mice [206]. Viral detection is also possible by PCR in biological materials, organs (intestine, mesenteric lymph node, kidney, spleen) and faeces from infected animals [187], [189], [206], [207], [209]. Although MVM was not thought to cause persistent infection in immunocompetent mice, recent data show that it can be detected in spleens for up to 16 weeks after exposure in some mouse strains [207]. Therefore, PCR may be considered as a confirmatory method for serology.",

The genome organization and replication of LDV and other arteriviruses, their cell biology and other molecular aspects have been reviewed by Snijder and Meulenberg [214]. LDV has repeatedly been detected in wild mice (Mus musculus), which are considered to be a virus reservoir [215], [216]. After infection of mice, virus titres of 1010\u20131011 particles per ml serum are found within 12\u201314 h after infection. The virus titre drops to 105 particles per ml within 2\u20133 weeks and remains constant at this level for life. It persists in infected mice for the whole lifetime although it stimulates various immune mechanisms [216], [217], [218], [219]. The virus can be stored in undiluted mouse plasma at \u221270 \u00b0C without loss of infectivity, but it is not stable at room temperature and is very sensitive to environmental conditions. Only mice and primary mouse cells are susceptible to infection with LDV. It replicates in a subpopulation of macrophages in almost all tissues and persists in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and testes tissues [220]. As suitable cell systems have not been available for virus production, routine serology has not been easily possible so that testing for LDV was not included in serological health monitoring programs. The prevalence of LDV in contemporary colonies of laboratory rodents is likely to be very low but detailed information about its prevalence comparable to most other agents is not available.",

It produces a persistent infection with continuous virus production and a lifelong viraemia despite LDV-specific immune reactions of the host [217]. LDV has been found in numerous biological materials that are serially passaged in mice such as transplantable tumours including human tumours or matrigel prepared from such materials [1], [2], [222], [223], monoclonal antibodies or ascitic fluids [224], or infectious agents (e.g. haemoprotozoans, K virus, Clostridium piliforme). These materials are contaminated after serial passage in an infected and viraemic mouse. Contamination with LDV leads to the infection of each sequential host and to transmission of the virus by the next passage and remains associated with the specimen. It is therefore the most frequently detected contaminant in biological materials [1], [2].",

Maternal immunity protects fetuses from intrauterine infection. Immunodeficient Prkdcscid mice also transmit virus to their offspring during chronic infection [229].

            "text": "In principle, serological methods such as IFA may be used for detecting LDV infection [230] but they are not of practical importance. Circulating virus\u2013antibody complexes interfere with serological tests, and sufficient quantities of virus for serological tests are difficult to generate because LDV replicates only in specific subpopulations of primary cultures of murine macrophages and monocytes for one cell cycle [226]. However, it is meanwhile possible to use recombinant viral proteins of LDV as antigens [231] in ELISA and MFIA tests so that routine testing by serology is possible. In the past, diagnosis of LDV infection has primarily been based on increased LDH activity in serum or plasma of mice. LDV activity in serum or plasma can be measured directly, or samples (e.g. plasma, cell or organ homogenates) are inoculated into pathogen-free mice and the increase in LDH activity within 3\u20134 days is measured. An 8\u201310-fold increase is indicative of LDV infection. Detection of infectivity of a plasma sample by the induction of increased LDH activity in the recipient animal is the most reliable means of identifying an infected animal. However, it is important to use clear non-haemolysed samples because haemolysis will (falsely) elevate activities of multiple serum or plasma enzymes, including LDH. This assay was usually included in a \u2018MAP test\u2019, but antibody detection similar to other viruses was not involved for reasons mentioned earlier. Persistent infection makes LDV an ideal candidate for PCR detection in plasma or in organ homogenates [232], [233]. However, reports exist that PCR may produce false-negative results and should be used cautiously [234]. Just as important as detecting LDV in animals is its detection in biological materials. This may be done by assay for increased LDH activity after inoculation of suspect material into pathogen-free mice [1], [2] or by PCR [232], [233], [235], [236], [237].",

Therefore, LDV-negative breeding populations can easily be established by selecting animals with normal plasma LDH activity. Embryo transfer and hysterectomy derivation are also efficient. The presence of LDV in experimental populations may be indicative of contaminated biological materials. In such cases, it is essential that the virus is also eliminated from these samples. This is easily achieved by maintenance of cells by in vitro culture instead of by animal-to-animal passages [238]. Due to the extreme host specificity of the virus, contaminated tumour samples can also be sanitized by passages in nude rats [223] or other animal species. Another method to remove LDV from contaminated cells, which is based on cell sorting, has recently been described [239].",

It can easily be propagated in several commonly used cell lines like BHK-21 cells. However, cells are not lysed and a cytopathic effect (CPE) is not visible. The virus name refers to the condition that results from experimental intracerebral inoculation of the virus into adult mice and is not considered to be a feature of natural infections. Mice (Mus musculus) serve as the natural virus reservoir [246], but Syrian hamsters are also important hosts [247]. Additional species such as rabbits, guinea-pigs, squirrels, monkeys and humans are susceptible to natural or experimental infection [248]. Natural infection of callitrichid primates (marmosets and tamarins) leads to a progressive hepatic disease that is known as \u2018callitrichid hepatitis\u2019 [249], [250]. Antibodies to LCMV have been found in wild mice in Europe [251], [252], Africa [253], Asia [254], Australia [125] and America [255]. Thus, it is the only arenavirus with worldwide distribution. Infection with LCMV is rarely found in laboratory mice [248]. Seropositivity to LCMV in laboratory mice was reported to be low during the last decade [11], [15], [17], [124] or negative [12], [13], [14]. In addition to laboratory mice and other vertebrate hosts, the virus has frequently been found in transplantable tumours and tissue culture cell lines from mice and hamsters [2], [256].\n",

It has also been transmitted to humans by infected laboratory mice [262] and by pet and laboratory Syrian hamsters [263], [264], [265], [266]. In addition, contaminated biological materials are important sources of infections for humans, and several outbreaks of LCM among laboratory personnel have been traced to transplantable tumours [267], [268]. Transmission of LCMV to humans also occurred repeatedly by organ transplantation and was most likely transmitted to organ donors by close contact with infected pets [266], [269].

Two forms of natural LCMV infection are generally recognized: a persistent tolerant and an (acute) non-tolerant form. The persistent form results from infection of mice that are immunotolerant. This is the case if mice are infected in utero or during the first days after birth. This form is characterized by lifelong viraemia and viral shedding. Mice may show growth retardation, especially during the first 3\u20134 weeks, but they appear otherwise normal. Infectious virus is bound to specific antibodies and complement, and these complexes accumulate in the renal glomeruli, the choroid plexus, and sometimes also in synovial membranes and blood vessel walls. At 7\u201310 months of age, immune complex nephritis develops with ruffled fur, hunched posture, ascites and occasional deaths. This immunopathologic phenomenon is called \u2018late onset disease\u2019 or \u2018chronic immune complex disease\u2019. The incidence of this type of disease varies between mouse strains. Gross lesions include enlarged spleen and lymph nodes due to lymphoid hyperplasia. Kidneys affected with glomerulonephritis may be enlarged with a granular surface texture or may be shrunken in later stages of the disease process. Microscopically, there is generalized lymphoid hyperplasia and immune complex deposition in glomeruli and vessel walls, resulting in glomerulonephritis and plasmacytic, lymphocytic perivascular cuffs in all visceral organs [36].",

However, virus may persist at low levels in tissues (particularly spleen, lung and kidney) of mice for at least 12 weeks after infection as determined by sensitive assays such as nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR or immunohistochemistry [273]. Such non-lethal infection leads to protection against otherwise lethal intracerebral challenge.

Neurological signs usually appear on day 6 after inoculation, and animals die within 1\u20133 days after the onset of symptoms, or recover within several days. The classic histological picture is of dense perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes and plasma cells in meninges and choroid plexus. While infection following subcutaneous inoculation usually remains inapparent, reaction of mice to intraperitoneal or intravenous inoculation depends on the virus strain and on the mouse strain. Infection by these routes primarily causes multifocal hepatic necrosis and necrosis of lymphoid cells. Athymic Foxn1nu mice and other immunodeficient mice do not develop disease but become persistently viraemic and shed virus.",

Intrauterine transmission is very efficient, and with few exceptions all pups born from carrier mice are infected. Furthermore, persistently infected mice and hamsters can shed large numbers of infectious virions primarily in urine, but also in saliva and milk. The virus can replicate in the gastric mucosa after intragastric infection [278], [279]. Gastric inoculation elicits antibody responses of comparable magnitudes as intravenous inoculation and leads to active infection with LCMV, indicating that oral infection is possible, e.g. by ingestion of contaminated food or by cannibalism. A self-limiting infection frequently results from infection of adult mice. The virus does not spread rapidly after introduction in populations of adult mice, and the infectious chain usually ends. However, if the virus infects a pregnant dam or a newborn mouse, a lifelong infection results, and soon a whole breeding colony of mice may become infected if the mice live in close proximity (which is the case under laboratory conditions). The virus is not easily transmitted to dirty-bedding sentinels, and it is important that colony animals or animals having had direct contact with a population are tested to exclude LCMV infection [280].",

However, subclinical persistent infections may be difficult to detect because they may be associated with minimal or undetectable levels of circulating antibody. It is important that bleeding of mice is done carefully because of a potential risk due to viraemic animals. Historically, direct viral detection was performed by inoculating body fluids or tissue homogenates into the brain of LCMV-free mice or by subcutaneous injection into mice and subsequent serological testing (MAP test). More recently, PCR assays have been developed for the direct detection of viral RNA in clinical samples or animals [282], [283], [284]. Both MAP test and PCR can also be used to detect contamination of biological materials [235], [237]. Specifically for exclusion of contamination by LCMV, it was requested by different authorities that virus is inoculated intracerebrally at a lethal dose 3\u20134 weeks after administration of the material to be tested. In case of contamination by LCMV and subsequent seroconversion, animals survive the challenge infection.",

However, once LCMV has been detected in animals, or in biological materials, immediate destruction of all contaminated animals and materials is advisable to avoid risk of human infection. Foxn1nu and Prkdcscid mice may pose a special risk because infections are silent and chronic [268]. Cages and equipment should be autoclaved, and animal rooms should be fumigated with disinfectants such as formaldehyde, vaporized paraformaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide or other effective disinfectants. Prevention of introduction into an animal facility requires that wild mice cannot get access to the facility. Similarly important is screening of biological materials originating from mice and hamsters because these can be contaminated by LCMV. Finally, it has been shown that the virus can also be introduced into a population by mice with an undetected infection [280].",

They have a wide host range and are ubiquitous throughout the world. The designation reo stands for respiratory enteric orphan and reflects the original isolation of these viruses from human respiratory and intestinal tract without apparent disease. The term \u2018orphan\u2019 virus refers to a virus in search of a disease. Mammalian orthoreovirus can be grouped into three serotypes, numbered 1\u20133. Mammalian orthoreovirus-3 (synonyms: hepatoencephalomyelitis virus; ECHO 10 virus) infection remains prevalent in contemporary mouse colonies and has been reported in wild mice [20], [125], [290]. A study in France reported antibodies to MRV-3 in 9% of mouse colonies examined [10]. In more recent studies in North America and western Europe, such antibodies were detected in 0.01\u20130.2% of mice monitored [11], [14], [15]. Schoondermark-van de Ven et al. [12] found antibodies to MRV-3 in 0.6% of mouse samplings from western European institutions; and in a survey conducted by Carty [13], about 6% of responding institutions in the USA reported MRV-3 infection in their mouse colonies. In addition, contamination of mouse origin tumours and cell lines by MRV-3 has been reported many times [2], [8], [290]. Experimentally, MRV-3 infection of infant mice has been used to model human hepatobiliary disease, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus and lymphoma [8], [291].",

Following oral inoculation, reoviruses gain entry by infecting specialized epithelial cells (M cells) that overlie Peyer\u2019s patches. The virus then becomes accessible to leukocytes and spreads to other organs by way of the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. Neural spread to the CNS has also been well documented [293], [294].

The latter term has been used to describe the matted, unkempt appearance of the hair coat that results from steatorrhoea due to pancreatitis, maldigestion and biliary atresia. In addition, runting (attributed to immune-mediated destruction of cells in the pituitary gland that produce growth hormone), transient alopecia, jaundice (due to excessive bilirubin in the blood, which is attributed to the liver pathology, especially biliary atresia) and neurological signs such as incoordination, tremors or paralysis may develop. When present in natural infections, clinical signs and lesions are similar to but milder than in experimental neonatal infections. Early descriptions of naturally occurring disease may have been complicated by concurrent infections such as MHV (murine hepatitis virus) or murine rotavirus A (MuRV-A)/epizootic diarrhoea of infant mice (EDIM) virus that contributed to the severity of the lesions especially in liver, pancreas, CNS and intestine. The outcome of MRV-3 infection depends on age and immunological status of mouse, dose of virus and route of inoculation. Adult immunocompetent mice typically show no clinical signs and have no discernible lesions even in experimental infections. Mucosal and maternally conferred immunity are considered to be important in protection from or resolution of disease [297], [298]. Experimental infection of adult Prkdcscid mice is lethal [299]. Depending on the route of inoculation, experimental infection of adult Foxn1nu mice is subclinical or results in liver disease [299], [300].",

The HI test does not detect such cross-reacting antibodies but is prone to give false-positive results due to non-specific inhibitors of haemagglutination [301], [303]. RT-PCR methods for the detection of MRV-3 RNA [304], [305] or MRV RNA [302], [306] are also available. Reports on contamination of mouse origin tumours and cell lines by MRV-3 and its interference with transplantable tumour studies [307], [308] emphasize the importance of screening of biological materials to be inoculated into mice by MAP test or PCR.

They are surrounded by an envelope with a corona of surface projections (spikes). MHV is antigenically related to rat coronaviruses and other coronaviruses of pigs, cattle and humans. Numerous different strains or isolates of MHV have been described. They can be distinguished by neutralization tests that detect strain-specific spike (S) antigens, by use of monoclonal antibodies, or by sequencing [309]. The best-studied strains are the prototype strains MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, JHM (MHV-4), A59, and S, of which MHV-3 is regarded as the most virulent. Like other coronaviruses MHV mutates rapidly, and strains readily form recombinants, so that new (sub)strains are constantly evolving. Strains vary in their virulence, organotropism and cell tropism [310]. Based on their primary organotropism, MHV strains can be grouped into two biotypes: respiratory (or polytropic) and enterotropic. However, intermediate forms (enterotropic strains with tropism to other organs) also exist. Murine hepatitis virus is relatively resistant to repeated freezing and thawing, heating (56 \u00b0C for 30 min) and acid pH but is sensitive to drying and disinfectants, especially those with detergent activity [8]. Given the environmental conditions present in mouse rooms, MHV might remain infective for several days, at low humidity (20% relative humidity) or low temperatures (4 \u00b0C) even for weeks on surfaces [311].",

It can be found in wild and laboratory mice throughout the world and is one of the most common viral pathogens in contemporary mouse colonies. While polytropic strains have historically been considered more common, this situation is thought to have reversed. Monitoring results for research institutions across North America and Europe indicate that the prevalence of MHV has decreased in the past, though it seems to have remained quite stable since the 1990s [11], [12]. Recently 1.57% of North American laboratory mouse serum samples tested positive [15]. In Europe, prevalence rates ranged from 3.25% to 12% [12], [14], [15]. A retrospective study in France covering the period from 1988 to 1997 reported antibodies to MHV in 67% of mouse colonies examined [10], and a survey performed in 2006 revealed that almost half of North American research institutions detected MHV in their mouse populations [13]. Suckling rats inoculated experimentally with MHV had transient virus replication in the nasal mucosa and seroconversion but no clinical disease [312]. Similarly, deer mice seroconverted but showed no clinical disease after experimental infection [313]. MHV is also a common contaminant of transplantable tumours [1], [2] and cell lines [314], [315].",

MHV strains appear to possess a primary tropism for the upper respiratory or enteric mucosa. Those strains with respiratory tropism initiate infection in the nasal mucosa and then may disseminate via blood and lymphatics to a variety of other organs because of their polytropic nature. Respiratory (polytropic) strains include MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, A59, S and JHM. Infection of mice with virulent polytropic MHV strains, infection of mice less than 2 weeks of age, infection of genetically susceptible strains of mice or infection of immunocompromised mice favour virus dissemination. Virus then secondarily replicates in vascular endothelium and parenchymal tissues, causing disease of the brain, liver, lymphoid organs, bone marrow and other sites. Infection of the brain by viraemic dissemination occurs primarily in immunocompromised or neonatal mice. Additionally, infection of adult mouse brain can occur by extension of virus along olfactory neural pathways, even in the absence of dissemination to other organs. In contrast, enterotropic MHV strains (e.g. LIVIM, MHV-D, MHV-Y) tend to selectively infect intestinal mucosal epithelium, with no or minimal dissemination to other organs such as mesenteric lymph nodes or liver.",

            "text": "All ages and strains are susceptible to active infection, but disease is largely age related. Infection of neonatal mice results in severe necrotizing enterocolitis with high mortality within 48 h. Mortality and lesion severity diminish rapidly with advancing age at infection. Adult mice develop minimal lesions although replication of equal or higher titres of virus occurs compared with neonates. The age-dependent decrease in severity of enterotropic MHV disease is probably related to the higher mucosal epithelium turnover in older mice, allowing more rapid replacement of damaged mucosa. Another factor that is of considerable importance to the outcome of MHV infections is host genotype. For example, BALB/c mice are highly susceptible to enterotropic MHV disease while SJL mice, at the other end of the spectrum, are highly resistant [318]. Unlike in polytropic MHV infection where resistance is correlated with reduced virus replication in target cells [319], enterotropic MHV grows to comparable titres in SJL and BALB/c mice at all ages [318]. Therefore, the resistance of the SJL mouse to disease caused by enterotropic MHV seems to be mediated through an entirely different mechanism than resistance to polytropic MHV. Furthermore, mouse genotypes that are susceptible to disease caused by one MHV strain may be resistant to disease caused by another strain [316]. It is therefore not possible to strictly categorize mouse strains as susceptible or resistant. The genetic factors determining susceptibility versus resistance in MHV infections are as yet poorly understood. Both polytropic and enterotropic MHV infections are self-limiting in immunocompetent mice. Immune-mediated clearance of virus usually begins about a week after infection, and most mice eliminate the virus within 3\u20134 weeks [316], [318], [320]. Humoral and cellular immunity appear to participate in host defences to infection, and functional T cells are an absolute requirement [321], [322], [323], [324]. Therefore, immunodeficient mice such as Foxn1nu and Prkdcscid mice cannot clear the virus [317], [325]. Similarly, some genetically modified strains of mice may have deficits in antiviral responses or other alterations that allow the development of persistent MHV infection [326]. Recovered immune mice are resistant to reinfection with the same MHV strain but remain susceptible to repeated infections with different strains of MHV [327], [328], [329]. Similarly, maternal immunity protects suckling mice against homologous MHV strains but not necessarily against other strains [329], [330]. However, maternal immunity, even to homologous strains, depends on the presence of maternally acquired antibody in the lumen of the intestine [330]. Therefore, the susceptibility of young mice to infection significantly increases at weaning.",

            "text": "Most MHV infections are subclinical and follow one of two epidemiological patterns in immunocompetent mice [8], [310]. Enzootic (subclinical) infection, commonly seen in breeding colonies, occurs when a population has been in contact with the virus for a longer period (e.g. several weeks). Adults are immune (due to prior infection), sucklings are passively protected, and infection is perpetuated in weanlings. Epizootic (clinical) infection occurs when the virus is introduced into a naive population (housed in open cages). The infection rapidly spreads through the entire colony. Clinical signs depend upon the virus and mouse strains and are most evident in infant mice. Typically, they include diarrhoea, poor growth, lassitude, and death. In infections due to virulent enterotropic strains, mortality can reach 100% in infant mice. Some strains may also cause neurological signs such as flaccid paralysis of hindlimbs, convulsions and circling. Adult infections are again usually asymptomatic. As the infection becomes established in the colony, the epizootic pattern is replaced by the enzootic pattern. In immunodeficient (e.g. Foxn1nu and Prkdcscid) mice, infection with virulent polytropic MHV strains is often rapidly fatal while less virulent strains cause chronic wasting disease [317]. In contrast, adult immunodeficient mice can tolerate chronic infection by enterotropic MHV, with slow emaciation and diarrhoea, or minimal clinical disease [316], [325]. Subclinical MHV infections can be activated by a variety of experimental procedures (e.g. thymectomy, whole body irradiation, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, halothane anaesthesia) or by coinfections with other pathogens (e.g. Eperythrozoon coccoides, K virus; reviewed in [8], [309]).",

Recently, pulmonary inflammation has been observed in susceptible mouse strains (C3H/HeJ and A/J) after intranasal inoculation with polytropic MHV-1 [335], [336]. Neonatally infected mice can have vascular-oriented necrotizing (meningo)encephalitis with demyelination in the brainstem and periependymal areas. Lesions in peritoneum, bone marrow, thymus and other tissues can be variably present. Mice can develop nasoencephalitis due to extension of infection from the nasal mucosa along olfactory pathways to the brain, with meningoencephalitis and demyelination, the latter of which is thought to be largely T-cell mediated [324]. This pattern of infection regularly occurs after intranasal inoculation of many MHV strains but is a relatively rare event after natural exposure. Syncytium arising from endothelium, parenchyma or leukocytes is a hallmark of infection in many tissues including intestine, lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, brain and bone marrow. Lesions are transient and seldom fully developed in adult immunocompetent mice, but they are manifest in immunocompromised mice. Highly unusual presentations can occur in mice with specific gene defects. For example, granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis were found in interferon-gamma-deficient mice infected with MHV [337].",

The most common sites are terminal ileum, caecum and proximal colon. The severity of disease is primarily age-dependent, with neonatal mice being most severely affected. These mice show segmentally distributed areas of villus attenuation, enterocytic syncytia (balloon cells) and mucosal necrosis accompanied by leukocytic infiltration. Intracytoplasmic inclusions are present in enterocytes. Erosions, ulceration, and haemorrhage may be seen in more severe cases. Lesions can be fully developed within 24\u201348 h, but are usually more severe at 3\u20135 days after infection. Surviving mice may develop compensatory mucosal hyperplasia. Mesenteric lymph nodes usually contain lymphocytic syncytia, and mesenteric vessels may contain endothelial syncytia. Pathological changes in older mice are generally much more subtle and may only consist of transient syncytia. An occasional exception seems to occur in immunodeficient animals such as Foxn1nu mice, which can develop chronic hyperplastic typhlocolitis of varying severity [325], but other agents such as Helicobacter spp. may have been involved. In general, enterotropic MHV strains do not disseminate, but hepatitis and encephalitis can occur with some virus strains in certain mouse genotypes. In T-cell deficient mice, multisystemic lethal infection was observed after experimental infection with the enterotropic strain MHV-Y [338].",

            "text": "Diagnosis during the acute stage of infection can be made by histological demonstration of characteristic lesions with syncytia in target tissues, but clinical signs and lesions can be highly variable and may not be prominent. Suckling, genetically susceptible or immunocompromised mice are the best candidates for evaluation. Active infection can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry [343] or by virus isolation. Virus recovery from infected tissues is difficult but can be accomplished using primary macrophage cultures or a number of established cell lines such as NCTC 1469 or DBT [301]. These cells, however, may not be successful substrates for some enterotropic MHV strains. Virus in suspect tissue can also be confirmed by bioassays such as MAP testing or infant or Foxn1nu mouse inoculation [301], [344]. Amplification by passage in these mice increases the likelihood of detection of lesions and antigen, or virus recovery. Other direct diagnostic methods that have been successfully utilized to detect MHV in faeces or tissue of infected mice include monoclonal antibody solution hybridization assay [345] and a number of RT-PCR assays [346], [347], [348], [349]. Because of the transient nature of MHV infection in immunocompetent mice, serology is the most appropriate diagnostic tool for routine monitoring. Multiplex fluorescent immunoassay, ELISA and IFA are well established and sensitive, and all known MHV strains cross-react in these tests [301], [350], [351]. The magnitude of antibody response depends on MHV strain and mouse genotype [319], [352]. DBA/2 mice are poor antibody responders whereas C57BL/6 mice produce a high antibody titre and are therefore good sentinels. Antibody titres remain high over a period of at least 6 months [327], [329]. Infected mice may not develop detectable antibodies for up to 14 days after initial exposure [350]. In such cases, a direct diagnostic method, as discussed above, may be useful. Another drawback of serology is that mice weaned from immune dams can have maternal antibodies until they are 10 weeks of age [353]. This may impact serological monitoring because the possibility must be considered that low positive results are due to maternally derived passive immunity. Because the virus can be transmitted by transplantable tumours and other biological materials from mice, including hybridomas [354] and embryonic stem cells [355], [356] these materials should also be routinely screened for MHV contamination. Mouse inoculation bioassay, MAP test and RT-PCR can be used for this purpose. Therefore, surveillance programmes should combine careful evaluation of clinically ill animals, testing of biological materials and routine health monitoring. Soiled-bedding sentinel mice, which are frequently used for routine monitoring, are likely well suited for detecting enterotropic strains of MHV, but might not indicate the presence of less contagious respiratory strains of MHV [309] equally well. The mouse strain used as sentinel should be considered as a critical factor. Furthermore, duration of MHV shedding and stability of the virus, which seems to be lower in static microisolator cages than in IVC cages, might interfere with detection. The amount of bedding transferred seems not to be as critical as for, e.g. parvoviruses, at least for enterotropic strains [357]. Use of contact and exhaust air sentinels and testing of exhaust filters by PCR was also shown to be effective at detecting MHV [358].",

            "text": "The best means of MHV control is to prevent its entry into a facility. This can be accomplished by purchasing mice from virus-free sources and maintenance under effective barrier conditions monitored by a well-designed quality assurance programme. Control of wild mouse populations, proper husbandry and sanitation, and strict monitoring of biological materials that may harbour virus are also important measures to prevent infection. If infection occurs, the most effective elimination strategy is to cull the affected colony and obtain clean replacement stock. However, this is not always a feasible option when working with valuable mice (e.g. genetically modified lines, breeding stocks). Caesarean derivation or embryo transfer can be used to produce virus-free offspring, and foster-nursing has also been reported to be effective [359]. Quarantine of an affected colony with no breeding and no introduction of new animals for approximately 2 months has been effective in immunocompetent mice [360]. The infection is likely to be terminated because MHV requires a constant supply of susceptible animals. This method works best when working with small numbers of mice. Large populations favour the development of new MHV strains that may result in repeated infections with slightly different strains [361]. It may be practical to select a few future breeders from the infected population and quarantine them for approximately 3 weeks [317]. This can be achieved in isolators, or in individually ventilated cages if proper handling is guaranteed. After this interval, breeding can resume. The 3-week interval should permit recovery from active infection, and the additional 3-week gestation period effectively extends the total quarantine to 6 weeks. It is advisable to select seropositive breeders because the possibility of active infection is lower in such animals. The breeding cessation strategy may not be successful if immunodeficient mice are used because they are susceptible to chronic infection and viral excretion [325]. Genetically engineered mice of unclear, unknown or deficient immune status pose a special challenge because they may develop unusual manifestations of infection or may be unable to clear virus. Rederivation is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy in such situations. Along with the measures described, proper sanitation and disinfection of caging and animal quarters, as well as stringent personal sanitation, are essential to eliminate infection. Careful testing with sentinel mice should be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of rederivation. If transplantable tumours are contaminated with MHV, virus elimination can be achieved by passage of tumours in athymic Foxn1rnu rats [362].",

            "text": "The first norovirus to infect mice was described in 2003 [364]. Experimental inoculation studies with this murine norovirus (MNV-1) show that duration of infection and disease manifestation vary depending on the mouse strain [363], [364], [365]. In immunocompetent strains, MNV infection is variable in length (e.g. \u22657\u201314 days in 129S6 mice, \u22655 weeks in Hsd:ICR mice) and does not induce clinical signs. Infection is associated with mild histopathological alterations in the small intestine (increase in inflammatory cells) and spleen (red pulp hypertrophy and white pulp activation) of 129S6 mice. In certain immunodeficient strains, however, infection can cause lethal systemic disease (encephalitis, vasculitis, meningitis, hepatitis and pneumonia in interferon-alpha-beta-gamma-receptor-deficient and Stat1tm1 mice) or persist without symptoms (\u226590 days in Rag1\u2212/\u2212 and Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice). These findings indicate that components of the innate immune system are critical for resistance to MNV-1 induced disease. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was demonstrated that MNV-1 replicates in macrophages and dendritic cells [366]. Meanwhile, many additional strains of MNV with diverse biological properties were isolated [367], [368]. An analysis of 26 MNV isolates revealed 15 distinct MNV strains that comprise a single genogroup and serotype [368]. Experimental inoculation studies show that several MNV strains are able to persist in various tissues (small intestine, caecum, mesenteric lymph node, spleen) of immunocompetent (C57BL/6J, Hsd:ICR, Jcl:ICR) and immunodeficient (CB17-Prkdcscid) mice with viral shedding in faeces for the duration of at least 35\u201360 days [367], [368], [369]. Murine norovirus is transmitted via the faecal\u2013oral route and is efficiently transferred to sentinel mice by soiled bedding [370], [371].",

It is closely related to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). The virus name is officially abbreviated as \u2018MPV\u2019 according to the International Union of Microbiological Societies [9]; however, the former designation \u2018PVM\u2019 will be used in this chapter to avoid confusion with the official abbreviation of mouse parvovirus (MPV). PVM infection remains prevalent in contemporary colonies of mice and rats throughout the world. A serological survey in France demonstrated antibodies to PVM in 16% of mouse colonies examined [10]. In more recent studies in North America and western Europe, the prevalence of PVM-specific antibodies in mice ranged between 0% and 0.1% [11], [14], [15]. Schoondermark-van de Ven et al. [12] found antibodies to PVM in 0.2% of mouse samplings from western European institutions. Antibodies to PVM have also been detected in hamsters, gerbils, cotton rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits [8], [378], [379]. Experimentally, PVM infection of mice is used as a model for HRSV infection and has therefore been extensively studied (reviewed by Rosenberg and Domachowske [380]).",

It is antigenically classified as a group A rotavirus, similar to rotaviruses of many other species that cause neonatal and infantile gastroenteritis [291]. MuRV-A/EDIM infection remains prevalent in contemporary mouse colonies and appears to occur worldwide. Large commercial laboratories found 0.6% to 9% of mouse sera from North American and European facilities to be positive for antibodies against MuRV-A/EDIM [11], [12], [14], [15], and up to 30% of mouse colonies in the USA were identified as affected in a survey performed in 2006 [13].

They are most prominent at the apices of villi, where rotaviruses infect and replicate within epithelial cells; the large intestinal surface mucosa may also be affected. Though inflammation is minimal, the lamina propria may be oedematous, lymphatics may be dilated and mild leukocytic infiltration in the large intestinal mucosa and submucosa has been observed in a recent outbreak of disease [36], [393]. Hydropic change of villous epithelial cells is the hallmark finding of acute disease. The villi become shortened, and the cells that initially replace the damaged cells are less differentiated, typically cuboidal instead of columnar, and lack a full complement of enzymes for digestion and absorption, resulting in diarrhoea due to maldigestion and malabsorption. Undigested milk in the small intestine promotes bacterial growth and exerts an osmotic effect, exacerbating damage to the villi. Intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion is further enhanced by activation of the enteric nervous system [394] and through the effects of a viral enterotoxin called NSP4 (for non-structural protein 4) [395]. It is hypothesized that NSP4 is released from virus-infected cells and then triggers a signal transduction pathway that alters epithelial cell permeability and chloride secretion.",

Mice older than about 2 weeks can still be infected with MuRV-A/EDIM, but small numbers of enterocytes become infected, there is little replication of virus and diarrhoea does not occur. The exact reason for this age-related resistance to disease is unknown. Pups suckling from immune dams are protected against EDIM during their period of disease susceptibility [396]. In general, the infection is self-limiting and resolves within days. Successful viral control and clearance is promoted by an intact immune response [396], [397], [398], [399], and some immunodeficient mice (e.g. Prkdcscid and Rag2tm1Fwa mice) may shed virus for extended periods or become persistently infected [400], [401].

As MuRV-A/EDIM shares the VP6 protein determined group A antigen, for example, with human, simian or bovine rotavirus strains, commercially available ELISA assays utilizing polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies have been used to detect rotavirus antigen in mice; however, great care must be taken in interpreting the results because some feeds have been reported to cause false-positive reactions with certain ELISA kits [403]. Electron microscopy of faeces of diarrhoeic pups should reveal typical wheel-shaped rotavirus particles, 60\u201380 nm in diameter. RT-PCR also can be used to detect rotavirus RNA in faecal samples [404].

In addition, there is evidence that hamsters, guinea-pigs and rabbits are susceptible to infection with SeV [8], [301], [406], [407]; however, some apparently seropositive guinea-pigs may in fact be seropositive to other parainfluenza viruses instead of SeV. A study in France reported antibodies to SeV in 17% of mouse colonies examined [10]. A low rate of seropositive mice (0.2%) was found in a survey in North America [11]. Schoondermark-van de Ven et al. [12] also found antibodies to SeV in 0.2% of mouse samplings from western European institutions. In more recent surveys in North America and western Europe, SeV infection was not detected [13], [14], [15], indicating that SeV, like most viruses, has meanwhile been eliminated from the majority of mouse colonies. SeV can contaminate biological materials [1].",

            "text": "Two epidemiologic patterns of SeV infection have been recognized, an enzootic (subclinical) and epizootic (clinically apparent) type [8], [379], [409]. Enzootic infections commonly occur in breeding or open colonies, where the constant supply of susceptible animals perpetuates the infection. In breeding colonies, mice are infected shortly after weaning as maternal antibody levels wane. Normally, the infection is subclinical, with virus persisting for approximately 2 weeks, accompanied by seroconversion that persists for a year or longer. Epizootic infections occur upon first introduction of the virus to a colony and either die out (self-cure) after 2\u20137 months or become enzootic depending on colony conditions. The epizootic form is generally acute, and morbidity is very high, resulting in nearly all susceptible animals becoming infected within a short time. Clinical signs vary and include rough hair coat, hunched posture, chattering, respiratory distress, prolonged gestation, death of neonates and sucklings and runting in young mice. Breeding colonies may return to normal productivity within 2 months and thereafter maintain the enzootic pattern of infection. Factors such as strain susceptibility, age, husbandry, transport and copathogens are important in precipitating overt disease. DBA and 129 strains of mice are very susceptible to SeV pneumonia, whereas SJL/J and C57BL/6/J and several outbred stocks are relatively resistant. Resistance to SeV infection is under multigenic control with epistatic involvement [410]. There is no evidence for persistent infection in immunocompetent mice, but persistent or prolonged infection may occur in immunodeficient mice and can result in wasting and death due to progressive pneumonia [411], [412]. Clearance of a primary SeV infection is mediated by CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell mechanisms [413], [414].",

Lesions of the acute phase, which lasts 8\u201312 days, are primarily attributed to the cell-mediated immune response that destroys infected respiratory epithelial cells and include necrotizing rhinitis, tracheitis, bronch(iol)itis and alveolitis. Epithelial syncytiae and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in infected cells may be seen early in this phase. Alveoli contain sloughed necrotic epithelium, fibrin, neutrophils and mononuclear cells. Atelectasis, bronchiectasis and emphysema may occur as a result of damage and obstruction of airways. The reparative phase, which may overlap the acute phase but continues through about the third week after infection, is indicated by regeneration of airway lining epithelium. Adenomatous hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia (with multilayered flat epithelial cells instead of normal columnar cells) in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli are considered to be a hallmark of SeV pneumonia. Mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in this phase tend to be primarily interstitial, rather than alveolar, as they are in the acute phase. The resolution phase may be complete by the fourth week after infection and lesions may be difficult to subsequently identify. Residual, persistent lesions that may occur include organizing alveolitis and bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans. Alveoli and bronchioles are replaced by collagen and fibroblasts, foamy macrophages and lymphoid infiltrates, often with foci of emphysema, cholesterol crystals and other debris, which represent attempts to organize and wall off residual necrotic debris and fibrin. Lesions are more severe and variable when additional pathogens such as Mycoplasma pulmonis are present [8]. Otitis media has also been reported in natural infections with SeV although some of these studies have been complicated by the presence of other pathogens [415]. SeV has been detected in the inner ear after experimental intracerebral inoculation of neonatal mice [416].",

It is considered to be a primary pathogen of the CNS of mice and can cause clinical disease resembling that due to poliomyelitis virus infections in humans. Antibodies to TMEV have been identified in mouse colonies and feral populations worldwide, and Mus musculus is considered to be the natural host of TMEV [420]. The best-known and most frequently mentioned TMEV strain is GDVII, which is virulent for mice. Infant or young hamsters and laboratory rats are also susceptible to intracerebral infection. The original isolate is designated TO (Theiler\u2019s original) and represents a group of TMEV strains with low virulence for mice. Many additional virus strains have been isolated and studied, and they all fall in the broad grouping of TO and GDVII. A similar virus strain has also been isolated from rats, but in contrast to mouse isolates, this virus is not pathogenic for rats and mice after intracerebral inoculation [421]. Recently, another rat isolate has been characterized and shown to be most closely related to, but quite distinct from, other TMEV viruses [422]. Antibodies to TMEV (strain GDVII) have been detected in guinea-pigs and are considered to indicate infection with another closely related cardiovirus [423].",

            "text": "The severity and nature of disease depend on virus strain, route of inoculation, host genotype and age [8], [36], [427]. In general, virus isolates with low virulence produce persistent CNS infection in mice whereas virulent strains are unable to cause persistent infection. Intracerebral inoculation results in the most severe infections, but the intranasal route is also effective. Experimental intracerebral infections with virulent FA and GDVII strains of TMEV are more likely to cause acute encephalomyelitis and death in weanling mice 4\u20135 days after inoculation (\u2018early disease\u2019). Death may be preceded by neurological manifestations of encephalitis such as hyperexcitability, convulsions, tremors, circling, rolling and weakness. Animals may develop typical flaccid paralysis of hindlimbs, and locomotion is possible only by use of the forelimbs. Interestingly, the tail is not paralyzed. Experimental infections with low-virulence virus strains (e.g. TO, DA, WW) are more likely to cause persistent infection with development of mild encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease after a few months (\u2018late disease\u2019). These virus strains infect neurons in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord during the acute phase of viral growth, followed by virus persistence in macrophages and glial cells in the spinal cord white matter. SJL, SWR and DBA/2 strains are most susceptible to this chronic demyelinating disease. CBA and C3H/He are less susceptible strains, and strains A, C57BL/6, C57BL/10 and DBA/1 are relatively resistant [428]. Differences in humoral immune responses play a role in resistance to TMEV infection [429], but genetic factors are also important. Several genetic loci implicated in susceptibility to virus persistence, demyelination, or clinical disease have been identified, including the H-2D region of the major histocompatibility complex [430]. Furthermore, the age at infection influences the severity of clinical disease. In infant mice, intracerebral infection with low-virulence virus strains (e.g. TO) is often lethal. Young mice develop paralysis after an incubation period of 1\u20134 weeks while adult mice often show no clinical signs of infection.",

Demyelination in immunocompetent mice is considered to be immune-mediated. Susceptible strains develop a specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response which is the basis for inflammation and demyelination. This reaction is mediated by T cells that release cytokines leading to recruitment of monocytes and macrophages as a consequence of infection of macrophages and other CNS-resident cells [431], [432], [433]. Protection from chronic demyelinating disease is possible by vaccination with live virus given previously by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal inoculation [434], [435]. Early immunosuppression at the time of infection, e.g. by treatment with cyclophosphamide or antithymocyte serum, inhibits or diminishes demyelination. Immunosuppression in mice chronically infected with TMEV leads to remyelination of oligodendrocytes [436]. Further details related to the pathogenesis of TMEV infections and the role of immune mechanisms have been reviewed by Yamada et al. [437], Kim et al. [432] and Lipton et al. [433].",

The viral strain most commonly used as antigen for serological testing is GDVII. This strain agglutinates human type O erythrocytes at 4 \u00b0C, and HI has been the standard test for routine screening of mouse populations. Meanwhile, HI has been replaced by MFIA, ELISA or IFA, all of which are more sensitive and specific. Virus isolation is possible from brains or spinal cords of mice with clinical disease or from the intestinal contents of asymptomatic mice. PCR techniques are also available to test for virus-specific nucleotide sequences in biological samples [442].",
