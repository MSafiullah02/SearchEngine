Except for SARS CoV, MERS CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all human coronaviruses are of low epidemic importance outbreaks (Fouchier et al., 2004; Zumla et al., 2015). Human coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses. MERS CoV infects human through the dromedary camel while SARS CoV is hosted in palm civet cat before it is transmitted to humans. The newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 is suggested to be hosted by an unknown animal before jubing to humans as well. Infection can occur from animal to animal and from animal to human in the case of close contact with infected animals (Azhar et al., 2014; Han et al., 2016). Additionally human to human transmission was reported for human coronaviruses (Elfiky, 2020a, 2020b; Ibrahim et al., 2020; Yang, 2020). SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 caused diseases are characterized by a lower respiratory ailment like bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, which leads to death with different ratios (Bogoch et al., 2020; Graham et al., 2013; van den Brand et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020).",

Inside the host cell, the MERS CoV genome is translated to Spike, Nucleocapsid, Matrix, Envelope, and a punch of non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase (Li, 2015; Raj et al., 2014; Sharif-Yakan & Kanj, 2014; Zumla et al., 2016). RdRp is an essential enzyme in the viral replication life cycle (Doublie & Ellenberger, 1998). RdRp domain of the polymerase has a conserved fold, which is characterized by two consecutive aspartates that protrude from a beta-turn structure (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Grande et al., 2016; J\u00e1come et al., 2015). Targeting the active site of RdRp was successful in blocking the infections in many viruses and pathogens (Elfiky, 2019; Elfiky et al., 2013; Ferrer-Orta et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Grande et al., 2016).",

Computational methods such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations represent a powerful tool to mimic the properties of biological molecules (Ganesan & Barakat, 2017; Leach, 2001). In this study, three of the anti-polymerase drugs used as inhibitors for the HCV NS5B RdRp are tested against MERS CoV RdRp using a computational approach. The tested compounds include sofosbuvir (approved against HCV in 2013), ribavirin (wide acting antiviral), and IDX-184 (tested in clinical trials). Besides, four novel guanosine derivatives are also tested and compared to the three drugs and the parent guanosine nucleotide. All compounds have been tested against a MERS CoV RdRp model built in silico and equilibrated by Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS).",

The protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used to retrieve the sequences for the polymerases of all human coronaviruses (MERS, SARS, HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E) (NCBI, 2020). Multiple sequence alignment was done using CLUSTAL Omega web server (Sievers et al., 2011) to reveal the sequence conservations among the downloaded sequences for human coronaviruses and HCV polymerase sequences (PDB ID: 2XI3). ESPript 3.0 software is utilized to prepare the multiple sequence alignment (Robert & Gouet, 2014). Structural alignment of the MERS CoV RdRp model and HCV polymerase structure (PDB ID: 2XI3) was done by the aid of Chimera software (Pettersen et al., 2004) (Root Mean Square (RMS) difference of 2.7 \u00c5).",

Different protein modelling webservers were used to build the 3D structure of MERS HCoV RdRp, while the model built by I-I-TASSER was the best model based on structural validation servers (Elfiky et al., 2017). The structure was validated using the Ramachandran plot, ERRAT, PROVE, and verify-3D software from Structural Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) (Hooft et al., 1996; Laskowski et al., 1996; SAVES, 2020). Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), Uridine triphosphate (UTP), IDX-184 (GTP derivative), sofosbuvir (UTP derivative), ribavirin (wide acting antiviral drug), and four suggested guanosine derivatives (Elfiky & Elshemey, 2018) were sketched using SCIGRESS 3.0 tools (Summers et al., 2012). The structures were optimized classically using the MM3 force field (Lii & Allinger, 1989) then were further optimized using semi-empirical parameterization methods 6 (PM6) (Stewart, 1991). Finally, the quantum mechanical density functional theory (DFT) was used to optimize the ligands\u2019 structure (Becke, 1993). The quantum mechanical functional B3LYP was also used to calculate the infrared transition spectra of the optimized ligands to ensure reality (Saleh et al., 2014).",

This values are very good in terms of the low sequemce identity between the target protein and the best homologous solved structure. Additionally, we performed long MDS run to ensure its equilibration and the reliability of the binding affinity data. Dramatic changes in the dynamics of protein subdomains, even apart from the active site, can alter small molecule binding. It was reported that the finger domain can move close to the palm domain during nucleotide addition to the RNA primer and hence we have to simulate the dynamics for a longer time (Elfiky & Ismail, 2019). Figure 2A shows the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD in \u00c5) (blue line), Radius of Gyration (Rodrigues & Bonvin, 2014) (RoG in \u00c5) (orange line), Surface Accessible Surface Area (SASA in \u00c52) (gray line) and the number of H-bonds (yellow line) versus time in nanoseconds. The 260 nanoseconds were enough for the system to be equilibrated, as shown by the saturation of the RMSD curve, which reached after ~30 ns. Besides, RoG, SASA, and number of H-bonds are stable during the simulation period with distributed values, as shown in panel B of the figure (the same coloring scheme of Figure 2A). The RMSD values of the equilibrated system were around 7.75 \u00c5 while it was a little bit smaller at the beginning of the simulation (before 100 ns). On the other hand, RoG and SASA values were around 22 \u00c5 and 20000 \u00c52 at the beginning of the simulation but these values are reduced during the simulation to ~21 \u00c5 and 18000 \u00c52, respectively as shown in Figure 2B. This indicates a slight reduction of the surface accessible area and protein radius of gyration at the end of the simulation compared to the first 100 ns of the simulation.",

The four suggested compounds have similar average binding affinities compared to the physiological parent nucleotide (GTP).

Besides, these four compounds have slightly lower (better) average binding affinities compared to the antiviral drugs ribavirin and sofosbuvir.

Tables 1 and 2 show the number of H-bonds formed between the different ligands and the protein active site pocket after performing the docking at 64 ns and 154 ns conformations of MERS CoV polymerase. Also, the amino acids involved in H-bond formation are listed in the tables. The conformations are selected randomly to represent the protein at two different dynamics states, after the equilibration period. As we can conclude from the tables, the number of H-bonds formed is different (from 2 to 7). Additionally, the active site amino acids (D255 and D256) are found to be involved in the H-bonding interaction or the metal (two Mg+2) interactions in all the tested ligands. This is the same mode of interaction reported in other viral polymerases like Hepatitis C Virus and Zika virus (Elfiky, 2019; Elfiky & Elshemey, 2018; Elfiky & Ismail, 2018, 2019; J\u00e1come et al., 2015; Mayhoub, 2012). Other residues are lining the active site pocket also involved in H-bonding and metal interactions such as D113 and K301 in both conformations of the polymerase (64 and 154 ns conformations). On the other hand, R48 and K302 are slightly involved in the interactions in 64 ns and 154 ns conformations of MERS CoV polymerase, respectively. Metal interactions are reported in all the docking experiments (see Tables 1 and 2). These interactions facilitate the binding of the ligands to the polymerase active site as reported before for other polymerases (Elfiky et al., 2017; Elfiky & Elshemey, 2018).",
