A rapid, specific, and accurate diagnosis can often avoid the need for further unnecessary tests, limit unnecessary or continuing antibiotic use (e.g., in cases of meningitis), ensure quicker management of patients, allow a more informed prognosis, and save on costs. Furthermore, specific active management measures may be indicated. The management of needlestick injuries to medical staff, screening of donated organs before transplantation, and application of blood isolation precautions for particular surgical procedures, are all highly dependent on the testing for blood-borne viruses. Cesarean section may be advisable if a woman has primary genital herpes at the time of delivery. Special care and education are required for a baby with congenital defects attributable to rubella or cytomegalovirus. Pregnancy termination is recommended if rubella is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy.2.\nUse of antiviral agents usually requires accurate laboratory identification of the infecting virus. In some chronic diseases, for example, those caused by HIV and hepatitis B virus, decisions about when to initiate therapy require a full understanding of clinical and laboratory findings. Drug combinations appropriate for each patient are selected and later modified based on the drug resistance profile of the infecting virus strain. Results of virus load testing are used to monitor the response to therapy and guide changes to therapy.3.Infections may demand public health measures to prevent spread to others. For instance, blood banks routinely screen for HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses that may be present in blood donated by symptomless carriers. Since herpes simplex virus type 2 is readily transmissible to sexual partners, in some settings contact tracing helps protect sexual partners. Nosocomial infections (e.g., varicella, measles), often in epidemic form, may create havoc in a leukemia ward of a children\u2019s hospital, unless hyperimmune IgG is promptly administered to potential contacts following diagnosis of the sentinel case. Documentation of a novel strain of influenza virus may herald the start of a major epidemic against which vulnerable older members of the community should be immunized. Positive identification of a particular arbovirus in a case of encephalitis enables authorities to promulgate warnings and initiate appropriate mosquito control measures. Introduction of a dangerous exotic disease demands containment and surveillance, and so on.4.\nSurveillance of viral infections may shed light as to the significance, natural history, and prevalence of a virus in the community, allowing control measures to be designed, control priorities to be established, and immunization programs to be monitored and evaluated.5.Continuous surveillance of a community may provide evidence of new epidemics, new diseases, new viruses, or new virus\u2013disease associations. New viruses and new virus\u2013disease associations continue to be discovered every year. It should be stressed that over 90% of all the human viruses known today were completely unknown at the end of World War II. Opportunities are legion for astute clinicians as well as pathologists, virologists, and epidemiologists to be instrumental in such discoveries.\n",

In recent decades direct detection methods, capable of providing a definitive answer in less than 24 hours, have undergone major advancement, whereas virus serology has become restricted to particular purposes only.

Biopsy or autopsy specimens may be taken by needle or knife from any part of the body for virus isolation, or snap-frozen for immunofluorescence. Obviously, tissue taken at autopsy or biopsy for the purpose of virus isolation must not be placed in formalin or any other fixative. In the case of many generalized viral diseases it may not be obvious as to what specimen is required. As a rough working rule it can be said that at a sufficiently early stage in the disease, virus can usually be isolated from a throat swab, feces, or blood. In all cases, it is essential to capture sufficient patient material on the (preferably moistened) swab; negative diagnoses are to be expected if a medical attendant fails to collect enough material from the patient.",

After unbound antigen has been washed away, an enzyme-labeled antiviral antibody (the \u201cdetector\u201d antibody) is added. (Various enzymes can be linked to antibody; horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase are the most commonly used.) After a final washing step, readout is based on the color change that follows addition of an appropriate organic substrate for the particular enzyme. The colored product of the action of the enzyme on the substrate should be clearly seen by eye. The test can be made quantitative by serially diluting the antigen to obtain an endpoint, or by using spectrophotometry to measure the amount of enzyme-conjugated antibody bound to the captured antigen. Sensitivity can be enhanced using the high binding affinity of avidin for biotin; antibody is conjugated to biotin, a reagent of low Mr that gives reproducible labeling and does not alter the antigen-binding capacity of the detector antibody. The antigen\u2013antibody complex is identified by adding avidin-labeled enzyme, followed by enzyme substrate (Fig. 10.3, right). To further increase sensitivity, high-energy substrates are available which release fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or radioactive products that can be identified in very small amounts.",

Thus viral DNA extracted from a very small number of virions or infected cells can be amplified to the point where it can be readily identified. PCR can also be used to detect viral RNA by including a preliminary step in which reverse transcriptase is used to convert RNA to DNA. It is not necessary or usual to amplify the whole genome, but it is necessary to know at least sufficient nucleotide sequence in order to synthesize two oligonucleotide primers, usually about 20 residues in length, that hybridize to opposite strands of the target DNA and flank the region one chooses to amplify. The two primers (sometimes known as \u201cforward\u201d and \u201creverse\u201d primers) provide the DNA polymerase with an initiation point to which additional nucleotides can be attached, and also attach the reaction to the specific DNA target region. Primers can be synthesized containing attached ligands or molecular tags, thereby generating tagged DNA product molecules to facilitate further analysis. Computer programs can be used to design optimum primer sets and to predict optimal PCR reaction conditions, for example, time/temperature/ionic conditions.

The synthesis reaction is catalyzed by DNA polymerase added to the reaction. The primer extension products from the first cycle act as templates in a second reaction, and the cycle of melting, primer binding, and primer extension are repeated many times. The number of DNA copies increases exponentially. Thus after 30 cycles the number of DNA copies, beginning with a single copy of the target sequence, is theoretically 230 or 1 billion, and in practice over 1 million can be achieved. Forty cycles can be completed in less than an hour depending on reaction volumes and method, and by a suitable automated thermal cycling device. The amplified DNA may be detected either as a stained band of correct molecular weight on agarose gel electrophoresis, or by hybridization with labeled DNA or RNA probes culminating in any of a wide variety of readout systems.

These include:1.Use of the heat-stable DNA polymerase (Taq) of Thermus aquaticus, an organism naturally found in hot springs. Since this makes it no longer necessary to replenish the enzyme between cycles, the reaction tubes can remain sealed, and it also allows the use of higher annealing temperatures thereby increasing reaction specificity by reducing false-positive reactions due to mismatching;2.Use of \u201cnested\u201d PCR reactions, whereby a second amplification is carried out with primers internal to the initial target after the initial PCR amplification of a target sequence. This can greatly increase sensitivity, albeit at the potential cost of increasing the risk of false- positive reactions;3.Due to the detection of trace amounts of DNA sequence with extreme sensitivity, early PCR results suffered from regular problems of environmental contamination with DNA products leading to false-positive results. The procedure developed a reputation for unreliability, and laboratories went to heroic efforts to prevent reaction contamination, including stringent physical segregation of the different steps in the procedure. This has become far less of a problem with recent advances, in particular the use of real-time detection methods;4.Real-time PCR testing. This method for detecting PCR products required the development of a thermocycler with an inbuilt fluorimeter allowing measurement of newly synthesized PCR products in the reaction tube as were accumulating, that is, in real time. The reaction products can be detected by dyes that fluoresce when bound non-specifically to any double-stranded DNA, for example, SYBR Green; or by sequence-specific reporter probes (EgTaqMan) containing a fluorescent reporter at one end and a fluorescence quencher at the other, that bind specifically to newly synthesized target sequences leading to loss of quenching and emission of a quantitative fluorescence signal. As the reaction progresses, the intensity of the fluorescent signal is continually monitored and plotted, generating curves the position of which reflects the original concentration of target. This approach has largely replaced other methods for product detection because it does not require the reaction tube to be opened once the reaction has started, thereby minimizing contamination, it achieves excellent quantitative measurements, is more sensitive than earlier detection systems, and if a sequence-specific reporter probe is used it has improved specificity because only the target sequence and no other non-specific DNA molecules is detected;5.Development of more accurate quantitation. Real-time detection methods allow generation of standard curves the position of which corresponds to the original concentration of target, and an unrelated copy number control can be included in the reaction to detect any non-specific inhibition of the enzyme reaction. With a number of infections, the clinical interpretation and management are now dependent on regular quantitation of the patient\u2019s \u201cviral load\u201d;6.Use of multiplex PCR. Once different fluorescent probes became available for PCR product detection, it became possible to include different sets of primers bearing different fluorescent labels for different targets in the same reaction, and thereby to detect a number of different products simultaneously. This is exploited in a number of standard protocols for specific sites, for example, respiratory virus infections (Fig. 10.6\n).\n",

These oligonucleotides can represent conserved sequences from virtually all viruses represented in the various genetic databases, or can be customized to represent only viruses from a given specific disease syndrome, such as acute respiratory disease in children. The basis of the technology is the capture by these oligonucleotides of randomly amplified labeled nucleic acid sequences from clinical specimens. The binding of a labeled sequence is detected by laser scanning of the chip and software programs that assess the strength of the binding. From the map position of the reacting oligonucleotides, the software identifies the virus in the clinical sample. This type of test was used to initially determine that the virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a coronavirus. With knowledge of the oligonucleotide sequences that bind an unknown virus, primers can be made to eventually determine the entire nucleotide sequence of the virus.

Blood is collected in the absence of anticoagulants and given time to clot, and then the serum is separated. Acute and convalescent serum samples should be tested simultaneously. For certain tests that measure inhibition of some biological function of a virus, for example, virus neutralization or hemagglutination-inhibition, the sera must first be inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and sometimes treated by additional methods, in order to destroy various types of non-specific inhibitors of infectivity or hemagglutination, respectively. Prior treatment of the serum is not generally required for assays that simply measure antigen\u2013antibody binding, such as EIA, RIA, Western blot, latex agglutination, immunofluorescence, or immunodiffusion.\n",

In practice, there are many subtleties in the interpretation of results. For example, the timing of the collection of the paired sera in relation to the date of onset of illness must be carefully assessed to allow for inappropriate sample timing. Moreover, an individual with immunity due to prior infection or immunization may undergo a second or reinfection, often of a subclinical nature, but showing a rise in antibody titer. It is obvious that in reality, two well-timed paired sera to allow demonstration of a four-fold rise in titer, are often not available. Attempts are sometimes made to infer that a recent infection has occurred, on the basis of one serum sample containing a relatively high antibody titer; indeed laboratories may issue guidelines about what titer of antibody in a single serum may imply recent infection. In practice this is often unreliable, as the peak antibody titer seen in the convalescent stage of an infection can vary significantly from person to person.",

For example, infection with a dengue virus may produce IgM antibodies that cross-react with a number of related flaviviruses, and it may be necessary to titrate the serum against a panel of antigens, or test later IgG samples, to identify the particular flavivirus involved. False-negative IgM results are occasionally encountered in infants, in some respiratory infections, and during reactivation of latent herpesviruses. Despite these pitfalls, IgM antibody capture assays are an important first-line diagnostic approach for some infections, for example, hepatitis A.

Then, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called DNA melting.

In the presence of heat-resistant DNA polymerase and deoxynucleotide triphosphates, two new copies of the desired region of the DNA are produced. As PCR progresses through cycles of melting, annealing, and extension, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is exponentially amplified. After the first few cycles, virtually all the templates consist of just the short region chosen for amplification by the choice of primers. After 30 cycles, this region has been amplified many million fold. Many different variations of the PCR method have been developed to perform a wide array of genetic manipulations.",

            "text": "Figure 10.8: Virus neutralization, as exemplified by the interactions of neutralizing antibodies with human rhinovirus 14. (A) The normal route of infection. The virus attaches to the ICAM-1 receptor and enters by endocytosis. As the internal pH of the endosome decreases, the particle uncoats and releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm. (B) Possible mechanisms of neutralization of the virus by antibodies. At least five mechanisms of neutralization have been supported by experimental evidence: (1) blocked attachment\u2014binding of antibody molecules to virus results in steric interference with virus-receptor binding, (2) blocked endocytosis\u2014antibody molecules binding to the capsid can alter the capsid structure, affecting the process of endocytosis, (3) blocked uncoating\u2014antibodies bound to the incoming particle fix the capsid in a stable conformation so that pH-dependent uncoating is not possible, (4) blocked uncoating inside the cell\u2014antibodies themselves may be taken up by endocytosis and interact with virions inside the cell after infection starts, (5) aggregation\u2014because all antibodies are divalent, they can aggregate virus particles, facilitating their destruction by phagocytes. Any or all of these mechanisms may operate in quantitative neutralization assays. Virus neutralization assays may be used to measure the titer of neutralizing antibody in clinical samples, by reacting a standard virus inoculum with different dilutions of serum. There are many other variations, for example, known antisera to different virus serotypes may be used to identify the serotype of a new virus isolate; tests may be run in cell cultures with cytopathic effect or plaque endpoints, or in animals when necessary, and many steps may be automated.",

(B) Treated sera are serially diluted (twofold) in buffered saline in rows of wells of 96-well microtiter plates.

(D) A standard volume of turkey red blood cells (0.5% suspension) is added to each well. (E) The plates are incubated and read when control wells show complete red blood cell settling (button). Where virus agglutinates the erythrocytes, these form a shield pattern; however, where enough antibody is present to coat the viral HA, hemagglutination is inhibited, and the erythrocytes settle to form a button on the bottom of the cup.

In the alternative configuration (right), IgM antibody is captured from the test serum by immobilized anti-IgM, and any specific antiviral IgM is detected by progressive incubation with viral antigen and then labeled antiviral antibody.

(1) A virus-containing sample is digested with the anionic detergent sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide slab gel (PAGE), which separates the different viral proteins according to Mr. (2) The bands of viral protein are then transferred (\u201cblotted\u201d) onto a nitrocellulose membrane by capillary transfer or usually by electrophoresis in a different plane to immobilize the polypeptides. (3) The unoccupied areas of the membrane are blocked (\u201cquenched\u201d) by saturation with a suitable protein, then washed, dried, and cut into strips which can be used to test individual patient sera. Each test serum or plasma (\u201cprimary\u201d antibody) is then incubated with one strip to enable antibodies to bind to the individual viral proteins. Following rinsing, bound antibody is detected by the addition of enzyme-labeled anti-human immunoglobulin (\u201csecondary\u201d antibody). Following another wash, the bands are revealed by the addition of a substrate chosen to produce an insoluble colored product. This technique may be used with a preparation of known antigens, for example, an infected cell lysate, having been separated on a gel, to examine a serum sample containing unknown antibodies; alternatively, a known antiserum can be used to detect those antigens in an unknown sample that react after running on a gel.",
