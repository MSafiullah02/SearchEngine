            "text": "Background: Babesia spp. are hemoparasites which infect the red blood cells of a large variety of mammals. In bats, the only known species of the genus is Babesia vesperuginis. However, except a few old reports, the host range and geographical distribution of this bat parasite have been poorly studied. This study aimed to investigate the presence of piroplasms in tissues of bats collected in four different countries from eastern and central Europe: Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. Methods: A total of 461 bat carcasses (24 species) were collected between 2001 and 2016 from caves, mines and buildings. PCR was performed using specific primers targeting a portion of the 18S rDNA nuclear gene and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene, followed by sequencing. Results: The results of this study show for the first time the presence of B. vesperuginis in bats in central and eastern Europe. The phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rDNA nuclear gene revealed no variability between the sequences and the phylogenetic analysis of the cox1 mitochondrial gene proved that B. vesperuginis could be divided into two subclades. Conclusion: Our study showed a broad geographical distribution of B. vesperuginis in European bats, reporting its presence in five new host species (M. cf. alcathoe, M. bechsteinii, M. myotis, Pi. nathusii and V. murinus) and three new countries.",

Compared with other mammals, the role of bats in the transmission cycle of tick-borne protists [8, 9] and bacteria are less studied [10, 11] . The life-cycle of most of the Babesia spp. in domestic animals is well known and involves a hard tick as a definitive host [12] .

The species was later reported in the UK [15] in blood smears of bats, followed by experimental transmission studies [16] . Concannon et al. [17] identified the infection with B. vesperuginis by PCR targeting the 18S rDNA in six individuals from a total of 60 bats from Cornwall, UK, and they concluded that the parasite is different from other known Babesia. The only study outside Europe reports the presence of unidentified Babesia in Mormoops megalophylla from Colombia, with a low microscopic prevalence of 1.19% in blood smears [18] . In general, the diversity and ecology of bat piroplasmids remains unknown, and there is no data regarding how the parasite is transmitted. Hornok et al. [8] studied the presence of apicomplexan protozoans in bat faeces from Hungary and Romania. All samples were tested for the presence of piroplasms DNA with a conventional PCR and the positive samples (2.25%) have shown similarity with Babesia canis.",

All animals were found either as accidental kills of wind power generators, dead due to natural causes or euthanized because of progressive deterioration of general condition (in few captive specimens). A wind farm in Babadag, Romania, consisting of 20 turbines was monitored for a period of four years (2013-2016) using a weekly time frame with two consecutive days of carcass searches, from April to November. Bat carcases were found either fresh or desiccated. Samples were collected from carcasses which have been labelled fresh. These have been found on the second day of each weekly field visit and presented no signs of maggots or decomposition. All bats were identified according to morphological keys [19] and stored in 96% ethanol, at -80\u00b0C (samples from Austria) or in a freezer until their necropsy. Morphological identification of whiskered bats from the Myotis mystacinus group (M. alcathoe, M. brandtii and M. mystacinus) is not only problematic, but these species may show signs of hybridization [20] . Therefore, we distinguished these as the 'most likely' morphological species (e.g. Myotis cf. alcathoe in case of a bat identified morphologically as M. alcathoe). Genomic DNA was extracted from 25 mg of heart tissue using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instruction and stored at -20\u00b0C.",

All species usually form mixed colonies with congeneric species (e.g. M. bechsteinii with M. daubentonii). In other cases, roosts may contain mixed colonies, with species from different genera (e.g. M. myotis with Rhinolophus spp.). In hibernating sites, even species which roost in trees may encounter a wide variety of ectoparasites, including soft ticks. Some species are sedentary (M. alcathoe, M. bechsteinii, Pi. pipistrellus) [19] , others are adapted to migration over a few hundred kilometres (M. myotis) [19] and others migrate for long-distance, up to 2000 km (N. noctula, Pi. nathusii, V. murinus) [19, 34] . Long distance migrants feed on the go, fuelling their energy loss while migrating [34] . The range of species studied and their diverse ecology showed that B. vesperuginis has a wide geographical distribution among different bat populations; it can be spread over a long distance and has low bat host specificity. Most of the bat species that were negative for the presence of B. vesperuginis are sedentary, except Mi. schreibersii and N. leisleri. However, in most of the cases, the negativity of certain bat species for B. vesperuginis might have been a consequence of the small sample size.",

[15] suggested the involvement of Argas vespertilionis as a vector, as this soft tick was found on the majority of the Pi. pipistrellus bats infected with B. vesperuginis. Similarly, only soft ticks (Ornithodoros marinkellei and Antricola mexicanus) were found on Mormoops megalophylla bats infected with Babesia sp. in Colombia [19] . However, the presence of B. vesperuginis has never been tested in soft ticks of bats. Moreover, for nearly all the Babesia species with a known life-cycle, the vector is a hard tick [35] , suggesting a close co-evolution of piroplasms with the family Ixodidae. Nevertheless, Babesia meri is transmitted by Ornithodoros erraticus to the fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus) [36] . In addition, circumstantial evidence indicates the possible role of O. moubata (Argasidae) in the transmission of B. gibsoni in dogs after being artificially infected with this parasite [37] , showing that the involvement of a soft tick in the life-cycle of Babesia sp. is possible. All hard ticks identified (a few individuals) on the individual bats included in the present study were examined and proved negative for the presence of B. vesperuginis in a different study [9] .",
