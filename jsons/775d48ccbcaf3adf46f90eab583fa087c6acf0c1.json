In Lombardy, the most affected region in Italy by the CoViD-19 epidemic, Orthopaedic practice for elective patients was abruptly stopped in mid-February to preserve health-care resources, trying to gradually vacate hospital beds and prepare the departments for the increasing number of patients affected by the virus induced acute respiratory syndrome (called SARS-CoV2) who needed hospital care.

Gradually, since the beginning of March, available beds in Orthopaedics and Traumatology departments were reduced and often were merged with General Surgery departments. In this phase, the CoViD+ patients with traumatology or surgical urgent issues were hospitalized in single rooms in these hybrid departments, with dedicated healthcare workers and without the possibility to receive external visitors. During interdepartmental referrals for inpatients who required Orthopaedic consultations, whether in the emergency department, inpatient facilities, or in isolated wards, all personnel was instructed to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) and was taught to remove it safely. All patients with debilitating pain deriving from Orthopaedic degenerative disease were managed with conservative treatments for pain relief, yet inviting patients to go to the hospital only for unbearable pain. The clinical follow-up of operated or ER discharged patients was ensured, changing the method for the Orthopaedic surgeon to examine and deal with the patient. People with SARS-CoV2 infection, as described in literature, belong to all age groups; outpatients couldn't be screened for coronavirus, therefore all patients had to be treated as infected, even if young and apparently healthy. [5, 6] It was mandatory to avoid direct contact with the patients, to perform as little orthopaedic clinical examination as possible, and to carry out every kind of ambulatory procedure (stitch removal, wound dressing) wearing a complete surgical gown. Clinical practice was conducted in order to ensure that services could run without risks for both surgeons and patients: outpatients were encouraged to use home delivery services for medication prescriptions, clinicians were advised to prolong the time distance between non-urgent follow-ups, and the interval between consecutive scheduled visit in a single day was extended to avoid patient overcrowding in hospitals.",

The \"Hub and Spoke\" model has played, and is still playing right now, a central role in the management of SARS-COV2 pandemic in northern Italy. Orthopaedic surgeons and residents as well as MDs of other specialities are doing their part in order to overcome this heath emergency. All healthcare workers are doing their best to mitigate the CoViD-19 crisis, both assisting CoViD patients and maintaining a high standard in the treatment of other diseases.",
