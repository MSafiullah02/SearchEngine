Many patients with COVID-19 will be in critical condition and will need intubation. [1] [2] [3] [4] Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, 5 and the virus has spread across the world. Based on current real-time reports, there are 78,962 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 7,952 patients still in critical condition as of February 28, 2020. 6 Many have been intubated and many remain to be intubated. 5 The problem is that the viral load in the airway is probably very high and is very contagious. 3, 4 This poses significant risks for these who are performing intubation.",

Muscle relaxants are highly recommended. 5 The video laryngoscope should be placed as soon as muscle relaxation is achieved, and tracheal intubation should be accomplished and confirmed as soon as possible (less than 15 to 20 s). Confirming the depth of the endotracheal tube is extremely difficult using auscultation while wearing isolation suits. It is recommended instead to observe bilateral chest expansion, ventilator breathing waveform, and respiratory parameters. End-tidal CO 2 is a better indicator of successful tracheal intubation, as oxygen saturation is not always increased immediately after intubation in these patients, because the oxygen exchange is significantly impaired.",

Fogging of goggles is a serious problem during rapid intubation, which can make intubation CORRESPONDENCE and airway management a major challenge for the care provider. Poor visibility also increases the risk for potential injury and infection. One solution to the problem of fogging may be to cover the inner side of the goggles with a layer of antifogging agent, such as transparent hand sanitizer.",

Endotracheal intubation guided by a video laryngoscope with a disposable cover is recommended. Fiber optic intubation is feasible, but disinfection of the fibro bronchoscope system is inconvenient. The disposable cover should be removed and exchanged for a new disposable protective device after each intubation before moving to the next patient who needs intubation.
