In a ranking of health system performance, China ranked 144 out of 191 countries. Despite a relatively high ranking for level of population health (61), China\u2019s system was deemed to be weak in the distribution of health and responsiveness, as well as particularly unfair in distributing financial burdens of health coverage and illness expense. Although many might quibble with the WHO\u2019s performance metrics, few would disagree that China\u2019s health sector faces tremendous challenges, as the crisis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 brought into the international spotlight.",

The first section examines how several key health status indicators have changed over the past few decades, compared to other countries and relative to income per capita. China began the reform era as an international outlier, having achieving high population health status for its relatively low per capita income level. One might have hoped that China\u2019s above-average economic growth would have reinforced China\u2019s previously above-average health indicators. Instead, compared to unprecedented economic growth, health status measures have improved more slowly, or even stagnated at the aggregate level, with growing population disparities. By 2000, life expectancy, infant mortality and under-five mortality rates were all about average for countries of similar per capita income. Sections 2.1, 2.2 consider several alternative explanations for this \u201cregression to the mean,\u201d including the stresses of systemic transformation, reverse causality from health to subsequent growth, and changes in health care financing and delivery.",

Some developing Asian countries, such as Indonesia, experienced more balanced improvements in health along with GDP, but with similar overall results.2\nIndia, with a population also over one billion, has had lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality since 1980, with only a modest reduction in the gap by 2005; both China and India have had high out-of-pocket spending and large disparities between the rich and poor in terms of disease and financing burdens (Yip & Mahal, 2008). In developing Asia, as elsewhere in the world, systems of health care financing and delivery are closely shaped by historical and cultural context; although China might benefit from specific elements of many systems and from the \u201cadvantage of backwardness\u201d (Gerschenkron, 1962), no single health system model offers a panacea. For example, South Korea and Taiwan have established National Health Insurance (in 1989 and 1995, respectively), assuring their populations universal access to health care. Yet neither faces China\u2019s challenges in reaching a large rural population. China has borrowed from Singapore, implementing a system of individual Medical Savings Accounts combined with social risk-pooling funds. China has also built upon its own successful experience with subsidized rural community financing to extend NCMS to rural residents, and has largely followed a path similar to that of other transitional economies (in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union) of adopting social insurance rather than a National Health Service model. Future reforms may feature a mixture of models designed to fit China\u2019s wide geographic and socioeconomic variations across provinces and rural versus urban areas.",

China, in contrast, has grown continually throughout the past quarter century. Moreover, if systemic transformation \u2013 and its accompanying stress from unemployment, crime and drinking \u2013 played as important a role in shaping health in China as in Russia, the larger adverse health impact of transition would probably have been in urban areas, which are more similar to Russia and eastern Europe than are China\u2019s vast rural areas.

Numerous traditional healers and individual providers may be self-employed; but more \u201chigh-tech\u201d clinics and virtually all hospitals are usually government-owned. Lack of universal coverage frequently means that governments try to assure access through subsidized direct delivery, with administrative pricing of services as a mechanism for coverage. During reforms, most such economies are experimenting with privatization, competition and incentives in their health sectors, as in other sectors of their economies (Kornai & Eggleston, 2001).",

Public goods and externalities justify some government intervention. Canonical examples include control of communicable diseases like SARS and promotion of health activities with positive externalities, like immunizations. The developing country context reinforces other traditional arguments for a government role as well. For example, imperfect and asymmetric information (about how diseases are spread, the importance of sanitation and nutrition, the addictive effects of smoking, the quality of health care and pharmaceuticals, etc.) is more acute and problematic for a semi-literate population than for a well-educated populace. Furthermore, the lack of market institutions in many developing and transition economies, at least in the initial stages, seems to call for government to step in to fill the gap with market-promoting institutional development, if not direct command and control.",

In developing and transitional economies, contracts are even less likely to be comprehensive and enforceable, so that perverse incentives for providers to skimp on noncontractible quality are even more of a concern.

Arguably, by conventionally accepted methods of measuring affordability, China can afford to continue to have health spending increase at a rate slightly higher than GDP growth, and thus for the health sector to absorb an increasing share of GDP, for at least the next decade or two. Indeed, this will hold true if the experience of other developing and industrialized countries is any guide, because the elasticity of health spending with respect to per capita GDP appears to be greater than one (Gerdtham & Jonsson, 2000). An aging population, epidemiologic transition to more chronic diseases, increasing obesity and smoking-related illness, along with a significant burden from communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS\u2014all these factors make it difficult to envision health spending not growing as fast as, if not faster than, per capita income.",

In fact, expanding insurance coverage and promoting population health are intimately intertwined. Consider one example: addressing the needs of China\u2019s \u201cfloating population,\u201d the millions of workers who migrate from rural to urban areas in search of better employment and life opportunity. To date this population has been uninsured. Loss of productivity and poverty-induced illness for this population will adversely influence overall standards of living and economic growth, particularly since China\u2019s continued economic development will depend upon flows of labor out of agriculture and into urban industrial or service occupations. As labor mobility increases, epidemic diseases find an easy way to spread among the population. Expanding health coverage to the floating population will be critical for effective prevention and control of epidemic diseases and for closing the widening gaps in health status across subpopulations in China. Thus, the success of health reforms will be shaped to a large extent by how migrant workers are incorporated into the rural or urban insurance schemes and how effective population health initiatives are in reaching the migrant population.",
