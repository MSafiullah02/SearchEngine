            "text": "Fear of Swine Flu or other illnesses can be considered a specific type of anxiety called health-related anxiety. Taylor and Asmundson (2004) describe health anxiety as a useful function for humans to react to physical ailments with a certain level of concern. This normal level of anxiety often causes us to take the necessary measures to prevent and alleviate illness. Health anxiety becomes problematic when the anxiety is chronic and excessive, or when the anxiety is significantly greater than the severity of the health-related threat (Taylor, McKay, & Abramowitz, 2012). This kind of anxiety can be disabling, and is a common symptom in myriad psychological disorders, such as hypochondriasis, OCD, panic disorder, and specific phobias (Taylor et al., 2012).",

Additionally, a common OC belief includes overestimation of threat. In contamination-based OCD, this overestimation of threat may include health anxiety-based symptoms such as obsessions with becoming ill or contaminating others (Cisler, Brady, Olatunji, & Lohr, 2010). It is important to note that OC beliefs are not specific to OCD and are often experienced by individuals suffering from other anxiety disorders as well (Tolin, Worhunsky, & Maltby, 2006). Finally, those who are more likely to experience disgust may also endorse a greater number of pandemic-related fears. Disgust sensitivity is seen in anxiety disorders such as OCD and certain phobias, and has been shown to play a critical role in those suffering from OCD, especially when symptoms are contamination-based (Thorpe, Patel, & Simonds, 2003).",

In terms of anxiety regarding Swine Flu infection, about half of the participants reported being at least \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d by catching Swine Flu, and this percentage was significantly higher in the Malaysian sample (71% indicated they were at least \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d) (Goodwin et al., 2009). Interestingly, the researchers found that while participants in the European sample were more likely to discuss their fears with their friends when compared to the Malaysian sample, Malaysian participants were more likely to contemplate behavioral changes (i.e., not using public transportation, and purchasing masks and other goods in preparation of an outbreak) (Goodwin et al., 2009). These findings, plus the higher level of overall anxiety in the Malaysian population, shed light on some potential cultural differences when examining Swine Flu fears. This could be based on multiple factors, such as access to health care, access to information regarding Swine Flu, and cultural differences about emotional expression to friends and family.",

Therefore, it is possible that more Swine Flu fears and behaviors were reported when the threat of the flu was more immediate. Researchers may examine future health threats and determine the historical effect of when the data were collected. In this case, future research may compare Swine Flu anxiety during flu season to Swine Flu anxiety out of flu season. However, given the results of this study that an increase in symptoms of anxiety appear to predict an increase in Swine Flu fears, it would still be expected that this would be the case outside of flu season.

            "text": "Future areas of research with pandemic fears and health anxiety may also include examining other mediation models. For example, while the ASI-3 is a general measure of threat appraisals associated with panic, panic disorder is heterogeneous in terms of symptom presentation. Future mediation analyses might investigate these relationships by examining different subtypes of panic disorder, which include respiratory, nocturnal, nonfearful, cognitive, and vestibular (Kirchanski, Phil, Craske, Epstein, & Wittchen, 2009. Additionally, researchers may also consider examining environmental factors, such as media exposure to a pandemic, and their relationship to pandemic fears. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically-based treatment for health anxiety (Barsky and Ahern, 2004, Taylor et al., 2012). Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji (2012) note that exposure to media related to a pandemic may inhibit treatment effectiveness. In this vein, while the data collection extended past the primary pandemic period, this extended period was only at the New York site, where pandemic fears were especially pronounced given the severity of the outbreak in that region.",
