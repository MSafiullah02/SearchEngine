The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA estimates that restraint systems for children (positioning, age, and weight-appropriate car or booster seats, lap and shoulder harnesses, etc.) prevent 400-500 fatalities each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012e). These same initiatives also reduce childhood fatalities in other regions of the world. However, restraint systems may also cause injury and death, particularly when improperly used for the age, size, and development of the child, or when a child is seated in the front seat of a vehicle. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC have each produced guidelines and best practices for child passenger safety (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012e; American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention 2011). Children under the age of 13 years should always ride in the rear seats of vehicles. As a general guideline, rear-facing car seats should be used until the age of 2 years. After 2 years of age, forward-facing child seats should be used until the child is over 4 years of age or 40 lb (18 kg). Belt-positioning booster seats should be used after that point until adult lap-shoulder seat belts fit appropriately at upper thighs and chest when a child is over 8 years of age and 4 0 9 00 (1.4 m) tall. Disabled children have a similar incidence and distribution of injuries related to safety restraint use as compared to children without disabilities (Huang et al. 2009 ).",

In the majority of airbag injuries, a child was unrestrained or improperly restrained in the front seat, and all injured infants were in the front seat in rear-facing child restraint seats ( Fig. 27.1a, b) . The smaller stature of children and infants and the position of the head closer to the upward deploying airbag may account for the mechanism of these injuries. The relatively flat and horizontal character of the atlanto-occipital (AO) articulation in children also places them at greater risk of AO dislocation or separation (Saveika and Thorogood 2006) . Other large studies have confirmed passenger airbag injuries when children under 14 years of age occupy the front passenger seat (Newgard and Lewis 2005) .",

In a crash, the unrestrained forward motion of the child's upper body may cause the head to collide with knees or parts of the vehicle. Small children may also \"submarine\" completely out of an adult restraint system on impact, become airborne, collide with the interior of the vehicle and/or other occupants, or may be ejected from the vehicle (Tibbs et al. 1998 ).",

Current recommendations call for use of special child restraint systems until the child is over 4 0 9 00 (1.4 M) tall, and the lap restraint can be positioned on the upper thighs (not the abdomen) and the shoulder harness crosses the chest while not crossing directly over the neck (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention 2011). The immature pelvis of a child under the 4 0 9 00 (1.4 M) height requirement cannot be appropriately restrained with the lap-shoulder harness until the child is tall enough to position the harness in the correct areas (across the thighs and not the abdomen). Abdominal-wall contusions are infrequent in both optimally and suboptimally seat belt-restrained children, but when abdominal contusions are present, they often herald intra-abdominal injury (Lutz et al. 2004) . Intestinal injury, perforation, and shearing of the fixed ligaments and mesenteric structures are the most common abdominal manifestations of pediatric seat belt-related injuries (Davies 2004) . Because the small anterior pelvis of a child is not appropriately stabilized by the lap restraint system designed for adults, deceleration allows the seat belt to override the child's pelvis, producing hyperflexion of the child over the lap belt. This forces the abdominal organs against the vertebral column and momentarily increases the intraluminal pressure of the hollow organs, resulting in sudden compression. In addition to the abdominal injuries, the deceleration-induced compression and hyperflexion of the abdomen may also cause lumbar spine and sacral injuries (Hart et al. 2004; Papavasiliou et al. 2007) . Intestinal compromise may be immediate or may occur days to weeks after the injury (Hardacre et al. 1990; Lynch et al. 1996) . ",

In children under the age of 4 years, deaths from \"backover\" accidents in driveways peak in incidence, likely due to the small stature of children, their tendency to \"hide\" or play behind parked vehicles, and their lack of awareness of the dangers of moving vehicles. Crush injuries of young children, usually occurring from low-velocity impacts resulting from vehicles backing out of home driveways, are often fatal due to blunt-force injuries of the head (including closed-head injuries), skeleton, and torso (Partrick et al. 1998) . The most common vehicles involved in these accidents are sport utility vehicles (SUV), trucks, and minivans, as opposed to passenger cars (sedans, compact cars, etc.), perhaps due to the increased frequency of larger vehicle ownership by families with small children and the increased \"blind spot\" of vehicles with higher ground clearance behind the vehicle. In contrast to most other vehicular head injuries, these \"backover\" injuries are generally static; that is, they do not have significant rotational and accelerationdeceleration components.",

The point of vehicular impact (bumper) in a small child is at the head or chest level, both sites that are above the child's center of gravity. Because of this injury location, the initial impact usually results in a second impact, with the initial impact projecting the child away from the vehicle and against another fixed object, usually the ground. Consequently, the child may be run over by a subsequent vehicle. In contrast, the impact point in older children is below the child's center of gravity, resulting in impact patterns similar to that of adults. In older children, the impact point is at the legs with the body projected over or onto the hood of the car. Rotational motion is seen in these impacts with the legs rotating over the head on impact and with increasing speed, and the entire body may somersault over the vehicle following hood/windshield impact. The injury patterns seen in children reflect these different impact patterns, with head, neck, and chest injuries more common in pediatric pedestrian injury populations than in the adult population (Chakravarthy et al. 2007 ).",

Blunt trauma, fractures, and amputations may occur from impacts with trees, fences, or other obstacles. \"Clothesline\" injuries, including deep lacerations or cervical fracture, may occur to the face and neck when vehicles pass under horizontally strung fence lines. In some instances, multiple children are involved in an accident when an off-road vehicle is being driven with children riding on sleds or skateboards tied behind the vehicle (similar to waterskiing). If the vehicle makes a sudden turn, the increased rotational velocity may throw the child who is on the skateboard/sled away from the vehicle, resulting in blunt-force injuries due to the primary impact and/or a secondary impact with a subsequent structure (tree, vehicle, etc.). The majority of these accidents occur at lower velocities than traditional motor vehicle accidents, although some motorized off-road vehicles can reach speeds of 30 mph (50 km/h) or more, increasing the likelihood of fatal injuries and approaching patterns seen in traditional motor vehicle collisions.",

These and other regulations reflect efforts to reduce accidents and fatalities among adolescents until driving skills become more accomplished. Some jurisdictions may also limit or have additional requirements before licensing adolescents to operate motorcycles or may restrict operators less than 18 years of age to a smallersized motorcycle.

Rarely, defective motor vehicle exhaust systems may produce high levels of carbon monoxide within the interiors of moving or idling vehicles. \"Open-air\" carbon monoxide poisoning is a well-known hazard around combustion engine exhaust, even from vehicles in outdoor spaces. Asphyxia and positional asphyxia may occur with vehicle rollovers, entrapment within vehicle restraint systems, or in automatic window or door closure systems. Findings at autopsy are similar to other asphyxia deaths, with petechial hemorrhages often seen in eyes and intrathoracic cavity and hemorrhage within sinuses and sphenoid processes. Cyanosis, often intense, is present above the restraint area. Often the lividity patterns reflect the entrapment, clothing, and/or vehicular restraints ( Fig. 27 .3a-e).",

In these instances, investigative skill is required to correctly ascertain the initiating cause of injury. Chest impacts may produce cardiac contusions, including injury to ventricular free walls, papillary muscles, or the ventricular septum. These injured areas may rupture acutely, causing death ( Fig. 27.4) . Alternatively, the contusion may result in an aneurysm, infarction, or ventricular rupture days or weeks after the initial injury. Cardiac contusion results from blunt-traumatic impact to the chest with compression of the heart against the sternum and/or spine. The momentarily high intrathoracic pressure with deceleration may also contribute to this type of injury. Abdominal trauma may produce ileus or injury to hollow organs, particularly the small intestine, resulting in rupture and/or peritonitis several days following the injury. Vascular trauma does occur in children, but less commonly than in the adult population (Eddy et al. 1990; Riches et al. 2002; Choit et al. 2006) . These vascular injuries usually present acutely with hemorrhage or infarction, but may be delayed in discovery or presentation.

Usually these tragic deaths result from a caregiver forgetting that the infant is in the vehicle. The temperature in closed vehicles may rapidly rise well over the ambient temperature, and car interiors may reach 140 o F (60 o C) or more within 15 minutes (McLaren et al. 2005) . Infants are most at risk for this event since older children may be able to independently leave vehicles and/or alert adults to their presence. Autopsy findings are generally nonspecific in car hyperthermia deaths, although intrathoracic petechiae are often seen (Fig. 27.6) . Body temperature at time of discovery is important to confirm hyperthermia; however, this is often not available to the forensic investigator. Interior vehicle temperature is often not recorded and, if available, may not be reliable, as opening the car door will rapidly disperse heat, resulting in an erroneously low measurement. Due to the rapidity of heat exposure in a vehicle, vitreous electrolytes may not demonstrate a dehydration pattern, as is seen in slower exposure to high temperatures. If a victim survives, complications of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multisystem organ failure may be fatal hours-to-days after the hyperthermic event. There is considerable variation in the certification of the manner of death in these tragic events, with some practitioners certifying as accidents and others as homicides. ",

Pressure changes from compression may cause sphenoid and inner ear hemorrhages similar to those seen in barotrauma or drowning deaths dams, or streams within farms is another common cause of death in farm children. Asphyxial deaths can occur from hypoxic closed spaces or slipping into grain storage bins. Lacerations, skeletal fractures, amputations, and blunt-traumatic injuries result from falls occurring in farming activities or entrapment in farm equipment. Complex tools, firearms, and sharp implements are necessary for farming and ranching and pose a danger of injury and death in children. Falls from, or kicks by, large animals and a wide variety of animal bites also occur more commonly within rural settings. Off-road vehicles, such as ATVs and snowmobiles, are more common in rural settings, increasing the risk of injury and death from the use of these vehicles by children (Lim et al. 2004 ). ",

Inspection of the safety status of tractors in rural Kentucky (USA) revealed significant safety issues in the majority of examined vehicles (Cole et al. 2009 ). Similar conditions of tractors are likely present in most rural communities and explain the high incidence of injuries and fatalities related to children operating, or present around, this type of . Thymic petechiae were seen at autopsy. (b) Epicardial petechiae and hemorrhages were present. Petechiae were also present on the visceral pleural surface. Intrathoracic petechiae are consistently seen in hyperthermic deaths and are attributed to terminal gasping in an auto-resuscitation attempt farm vehicle and the diverse forensic findings that may occur in tractor deaths. Nearly half of the tractors examined in the study lacked rollover protection structures (ROPS). Most tractors did not have seat-belt and harness systems, or these systems were difficult to use, putting all operators, particularly young operators or youngsters riding with adults, at risk. Many tractors had a narrow front-wheel stance, creating stability issues and increasing the risk of rollover accidents. Many tractors had loose or damaged seats. Protective shields for starting were present on just over half the trailers examined, and nearly a third had the starting mechanism fully exposed. Rearwheel fenders exposed operators to moving tires in nearly 40 % of the tractors. Fully functional mounting and dismounting access steps and handrails were present in less than half of the operating tractors and, when present, were designed for an adult body. Many tractors had no functional lights, and nearly 70 % had no rear-view mirrors. Complicating these design and safety issues is the fact that all of these devices are designed for adult operators, not children. Ergonomic studies have demonstrated that even optimally functioning devices may have significant limitations for young operators who have not reached adult stature (Chang et al. 2010 ). Operation of tractors, equipment, and vehicles is common on family farms well before the age of normal driving licensing. In the USA and Canada, children from farms and ranches have an average of 6 years' experience in driving tractors and other farm equipment on family farms prior to formal licensing for motor vehicles (Marlenga et al. 2001) , indicating that many farm and ranch children routinely begin driving farm equipment at the age of 10 years or younger.",

Actual deaths may be higher, since world figures do not account for flooding, tsunamis, boating, and water-transport deaths. Drowning is more common in children under the age of 5 years, a fact likely associated with minimal swimming skills, lapses in supervision, impulsive child behavior, and attraction to water. Drowning is more common in males and often increased in lower socioeconomic classes and minority groups with children of African-American heritage at 1.3 times the rate of Caucasian agematched children and Native American/Alaskan Native children 1.7 times the rate of Caucasian age-matched children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012c). Infants and nonmobile children are at highest risk of death in home bathing situations or immersion in buckets containing water. Older children more commonly drown at swimming locations such as pools and natural water sites. Most of the drowning fatalities are related to the child's inability to swim; however, even children with proficient swimming skills acquired in pools or still water may drown with unexpected tidal and current flows present in some natural bodies of water. The contribution of trauma, natural disease, carbon monoxide, drugs, alcohol, hypothermia, or other risks must be investigated in drowning deaths. Many drownings occur when individuals have no intention of entering the water, that is, falling off docks or boats, water-transport accidents, or breaking through ice in a snowmobile or car. According to statistics of the International Life Saving Federation (ILSF), approximately 25 % of drownings occurs in individuals with swimming skills, or in water less than a meter deep, and 40 % within 2 m of the pool edge or shore (International Life Saving Federation 2012).",

Some use the term \"immersion syndrome\" when an individual has a catastrophic event, usually cardiovascular, while in the water and dies from the precipitating event or loses consciousness, resulting in drowning.

The pathophysiology of drownings involves lung and airway effects with resulting cerebral anoxia. In most drownings, the initial insult results from water within the airways and lungs causing inadequate oxygenation. Aspiration of mud, debris, sand, or vomit into the bronchial tree and alveoli may also occur and complicates the physiological response. This also increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chemical pneumonitis, and pneumonia if the individual is successfully resuscitated. Freshwater inactivates pulmonary surfactant on contact, resulting in atelectasis, further complicating oxygenation and increasing the pulmonary blood shunting physiological response. Osmotic forces may draw more fluid into alveoli from pulmonary intravascular spaces. The resulting anoxia and acidosis have the most immediate and consequential impact on central-nervous-system (CNS) function, although other organ systems may be involved in pathophysiological changes. These changes include cardiac dysrhythmias, blood-pressure changes from catecholamine release, carbon dioxide retention, and hypothermia. Metabolic acidosis is significant in \"near-drowning\" victims. Although initial experiments suggested that fluid and electrolyte imbalance and hemoglobin/hematocrit changes from osmolality differences played a major role in drowning, these changes may not be as common or as important as first thought. Deaths are reported in \"secondary\" or \"delayed drowning\" scenarios where acute lung injury and rapid pulmonary failure from inhaled water, debris, or chemicals within water produce death several hours after the event.",

Numerous tests have been proposed for establishing the diagnosis of drowning, including diatom presence and electrolytes or other substance differences in right versus left cardiac blood; however, none have proven sufficiently valid for forensic use. Tenacious froth, often with slight blood tingeing, may be present in the mouth and nares and is thought to result from an admixture of water, pulmonary surfactant, mucus, and blood plasma protein (Fig. 27.7) . This finding is supportive of drowning but is not present in all cases, and the absence should not be used as criteria for excluding drowning. Internally, froth and water are often present in the airway; the lungs are often heavy and edematous. During the process of drowning, individuals may swallow large quantities of water, distending the stomach. This constellation of heavy, waterlogged lungs often with water in the stomach is termed \"wet drowning\" and is present in the vast majority of drowning deaths; however, in a minority (about 10 %) of drownings, there is no water in lungs, airways, or stomach. Laryngospasm is postulated to occur in these cases closing the airway and resulting in \"dry drowning.\" In all drowning cases, the struggle to breathe or submersion below 2 m of water may also result in pressure changes reflected in hemorrhage in the inner ear and sinuses that may occasionally be seen at autopsy (Fig. 27.8) . Hemolysis of red blood cells may be present if copious quantities of freshwater are present. Often lividity patterns have a bright red tone when drowning has occurred in cold water (Fig. 27.9 ). All of these findings however are nonspecific and may occur in other deaths. Conversely, drowning may occur with none of these signs. Finally, in deaths from \"near drowning\" or \"secondary drowning,\" the findings at autopsy will more closely reflect the anoxic and secondary complications rather than the original drowning event.",

Although commonly seen in drowning, it is not specific; drownings may occur without this finding, and similar froth may be seen in other non-drowning deaths, such as acute drug overdoses/toxicities Fig. 27 .8 Hemorrhage in the mastoid sinuses in drowning. This is a common, but nonspecific, finding in drowning and is thought to be related to pressure changes lethal levels, in boats and around other internal combustion engines, and carbon monoxide quantitation should be performed in any water-or near-water-related death in which gas-powered engines were possibly present in the vicinity at the time of the incident (Jumbelic 1998) . Routine drug and alcohol screening should be performed to rule out incapacitating toxicities such as alcohol or opiate intoxication. Depending on potential medical and other case findings, additional toxicology or clinical testing, including vitreous electrolyte, ketone, and glucose levels, may be helpful (Byard and Summersides 2011) . Forensic investigations of drowning deaths should document water temperature to assess the potential role of hypothermia in the context of the case. If there is a possibility of diving contributing to the death, careful neck examination, including a posterior neck dissection and cervical spinal cord examination, should be performed to rule out contributions to neck and cervical injury.",

The skin in a scalding injury is markedly erythematous, blistered, or, with severe injury, completely denuded with intense underlying erythema. Sharp borders are invariably present between injured and uninjured areas. A characteristic of scalding injury is the distinctive injured/uninjured pattern created by different modalities of injury, including pouring, splattering, or immersion. In an accidental scalding injury, irregular patterns of splattering are often present on the face, hands, or upper body often from children pulling or tipping pans of hot liquids from stoves.

Electrical injury is challenging since often there are no distinguishing features. A high index of suspicion, through scene investigation and consultation with electricians, is critical to identifying and appropriately categorizing these deaths. Low-voltage (<1,000 V) electrocution is the most common type of electrocution in both children and adults. The classic \"Joule burn\" or electrical mark is present in approximately half of the cases. When present, it identifies the point of electrical current entering or exiting the body. The skin may be whitish (Fig. 27.20) surrounding a raised, oval, or round crater with hyperemic borders and a pale center (Fig. 27.21) . The shape of the burn may relate to the conductor shape in contact with the skin. Charring or edema is often present, and prolonged contact may result in deep burning of tissue. Microscopically, a \"streaming\" appearance of cells and nuclei is often present accompanied by thermal homogenization of the dermis, deep fascia, and underlying tissue Fig. 27.22 ). The epithelial basal layer of the skin is often detached. These changes are supportive, but not diagnostic of electrical injury. Occasionally, trace evidence of metal deposition from wires may be present at the site of electrical contact. The point where electric current exits the body is usually more difficult to identify and may be entirely absent. When present, it may have many of the characteristics of the site of current entry. Deaths from low-voltage electrocution are caused from electrical disturbances, primarily ventricular fibrillation of the cardiac conduction system or respiratory paralysis from interference with brainstem function, both autonomic disturbances that leave no physical trace to be identified at autopsy.",

The assessment of the degree of injury relative to the presenting story is a key component in distinguishing accidental and inflicted injury in the evaluation of a fall. In general, short-distance falls (less than 10 ft or 3 m) and falls down stairs rarely produce fatal injury to children (Chadwick and Salerno 1993; Chadwick et al. 1991; Chiaviello et al. 1994a) . The presence of an adult may complicate injury to the child as falls occurring with children being carried down stairs by an adult have a higher injury index and more frequent skull fractures than falls down stairs by children themselves (Joffe and Ludwig 1988) . The added mass of an adult and secondary impact(s) may be responsible for the increased severity of injury. Numerous studies of falls in specific situations exist in the literature including falls from buildings (Vish et al. 2005) , playgrounds (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012a; Petridou et al. 2002) , beds/couches (Belechri et al. 2002) , high chairs (Schalamon et al. 2006) , infant walkers (Shields and Smith 2006; Chiaviello et al. 1994b ), child-restraint seats (Desapriya et al. 2008) , infant slings/ carriers worn on adult bodies (Frisbee and Hennes 2000) , heights (Thompson et al. 2011; Murray et al. 2000) , and in hospital settings (Jamerson et al. 2009 ). Case reports of severe injury from accidental stairway and short-distance falls exist (Lantz and Couture 2011) , although the presence of severe head injury is more indicative of inflicted trauma.",

Careful and extensive photography of injuries, full radiological examination, fixation of the brain, and extensive histology are considered a baseline in the performance of the autopsy. Specialized dissections, such as removal of optic nerves, eyes, and posterior neck dissections including examination of cervical spinal roots (Matshes et al. 2011 ) may assist in interpretation. When there is a question of inflicted skeletal trauma, removal of the affected bone and the contralateral control bone may be important for evaluation. Careful review of all clinical records and police investigation is required for optimal interpretation. Correlation or identifying points of discordance with the given clinical history of how the event occurred is critical for case assessment. It may be helpful to have at least one meeting with all interested professionals, including clinicians providing care, radiologists (if appropriate), police and investigating agencies, child-protective services, and legal prosecutorial representation if jurisdictionally allowed. The adage \"We speak for the deceased as discoverers of truth, not makers of cases\" rings true in evaluation of the difficult area of pediatric deaths due to falls.",

This danger is amplified for young children where the injury rate for children in horseback riding is nearly twice that of adults from both falls and kicks from horses (Jagodzinski and DeMuri 2005) .

The use of \"break-free\" stirrups can decrease the risk of entrapment and dragging following a dismounting fall. In nearly a third of horse-related injuries, the child is not riding the horse, but is kicked while in the vicinity of the horse. Head injuries are the most common and the most serious type of injury, accounting for most fatalities in horserelated accidents (Ghosh et al. 2000) . In children, upper-extremity injury is more common than lower-extremity injury. Injuries to the back, pelvis, chest, and abdomen do occur, but with much less frequency in children as compared to adult horse enthusiasts. Horse-related injury is second in severity only to pedestrian versus motor vehicle injury, and horse-related injury has greater severity than injury from ATVs, bicycles, and passenger-related motor vehicle crashes (Bond et al. 1995) .

Large breed dogs may cause crushing injuries to the very young, including infants and toddlers, resulting in severe skull fractures and cerebral injuries. Several studies have examined the incidence and breed characteristics of fatal dog attacks, but may be confounded by the lack of accurate data into breed type actually present in a community as well as the effects of legislation restricting ownership of certain breeds (Raghavan 2008; Sacks et al. 2000) .

Crocodiles and alligators are territorial animals and may attack individuals within their home wetlands. Alligators are generally timid but may lose their fear of humans when fed or with repeated contact. In contrast, large crocodiles are more predatory by nature. Both species can move very fast on both land and in water, increasing the danger of attacks to small children. These species will occasionally drag victims underwater, preserving a portion of the body for later consumption. Their jaws exert the most pressure of any predator (Erickson et al. 2012) , with up to 3,700 lb per square inch pressure (25.5 MPa, 255 bar, 251 ATM), causing instantaneous massive trauma to victims. All these predators produce findings in child victims similar to those seen in adults, although children may be more susceptible due to their small size and inability to defend or flee from an attack. Rarely, smaller sea life may sting or envenomate victims, causing injury or death, by either venom or secondary drowning. In all these animal attacks, the findings at autopsy are similar to those in adults.

            "text": "Game-playing asphyxial deaths occur primarily in older children and young adolescents (Le and Macnab 2001; Andrew et al. 2009 ). Widely termed the \"choking Fig. 27 .28 Airway obstruction by a balloon. This was the autopsy finding in a 5-month-old infant who was found deceased by his caregiver. The father had lain down with the infant on a quilt and both fell asleep. On awakening, the father found the infant unresponsive a few feet off the quilt. Autopsy revealed an object in the upper trachea game\" within the literature and community, this activity usually involves a form of strangulation to achieve a brief period of euphoria. Strangulation may be achieved by use of hands, ligature, or noose and may be self-administered or done by others. Rarely, a variant of chest compression produces the asphyxial state. The resulting cerebral hypoxia is reported as a \"high\" with light-headedness or a few seconds of unconsciousness. With release of external neck compression, a \"rush\" or \"tingling\" is described among children experiencing this activity. This activity is commonly known among preadolescents and goes by over 75 local variations in both name and activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010; Macnab et al. 2009 ) and is seen throughout the world (Noirhomme-Renard and Gosset 2011). The cases presenting to a forensic service usually involve solo-game playing and are often initially thought to be suicidal hanging deaths (Andrew and Fallon 2007) . The physical findings at autopsy are similar to other strangulation or hanging deaths (Figs. 27.32 and 27.33) , and the key to recognition is within the scene and death Bean obstruction at the carina. This 8-month-old child was visiting his grandparents, crawling on the kitchen floor during a family gathering. He stopped moving and adults thought he was napping. A few minutes later, they noticed a darkening blue tone to his lips and tried to arouse him. He was unresponsive and EMS was called. He presented to the medical examiner's office as a sudden death in infancy during sleep. A sack of pinto beans had spilled in the kitchen the day before; adults thought all were cleaned up. The child had found a single bean in a floor crevice investigation ( Fig. 27.34 ). The activity is usually hidden from adults, but is widely acknowledged among peers, who usually regard the activity as a safe, drug-free \"high,\" a part of thrill-seeking activity and risk-taking behavior of early adolescence. There are no indications of suicide at the scene or by history, and there is no evidence of autoerotic activity. The incident usually occurs in a private location that the child regards as safe, often within a home or school. The children are often \"good kids,\" without behavioral, mental health, school, or drug/alcohol use problems. There are minimal gender differences in most studies, although some studies show a male predominance. In the USA, it is more common in Hispanic and Native American/Alaskan Native populations as compared to Caucasian populations (Toblin et al. 2008) . Key to recognition at the scene is the \"private yet safe\" location, the simplicity of the noose, absence of suspension, and facile ability to self-extricate from the compressing object (Fig. 27.34) , which usually is a simple loop against which youngsters lean. There are often wear marks on hooks or furniture from previous episodes or historical incidences of syncopal episodes, voice changes, new onset headaches, abrasions on the neck, disorientation after time alone, or accessing various electronic activities (websites, blogs, chat rooms) Fig. 27 .33 Layered neck dissection in ligature hanging. Careful neck dissection after removal of the CNS and body organs may reveal hemorrhage within strap muscles of the neck, corresponding to the site of constriction for asphyxial games. The absence of suicidal ideation, depression, or farewell messages is also important to ascertain. Invariably, peers will either acknowledge similar past group or individual \"game playing\" or confirm that the victim sought information about game-playing asphyxia. Although some describe this as a new risk, it may be a continuum of asphyxial games of past preadolescent generations, such as \"breath holding\" or hyperventilation to achieve momentary alterations of consciousness. The recent deadly inclusion of ligatures and nooses greatly increases the potential for death, especially when children engage in this activity alone.",
