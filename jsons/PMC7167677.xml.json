As of 24:00 on February 5th, the National Health Commission has received a total of 28 018 confirmed cases reported. The number of confirmed cases is far more than the total number of confirmed cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide, which indicates that the infectivity of SARSCoV\u20102 is higher than that of SARS coronavirus. There have been 3859 severe cases, 563 fatal cases, and more than 110 confirmed cases in children. The disease is still in progress.\n3\n SARSCoV\u20102 is the seventh coronavirus that can infect humans and belongs to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus group. Current research shows that SARSCoV\u20102 may come from wild animals, but its specific source needs further study. SARSCoV\u20102 is a new \u03b2\u2010coronavirus, and its gene sequence is most similar to that of viruses isolated from bats, but there is likely an unknown intermediate host. At present, it has been found that patients with SARSCoV\u20102 infection are the main source of infection, and the transmission effect of asymptomatic patients should not be underestimated. According to the current data, the main routes of transmission are respiratory droplet transmission and contact transmission. Close contact with patients with SARSCoV\u20102 infection and asymptomatic infection is the main way to cause children's infection. It has also been reported that SARSCoV\u20102 can also be transmitted through aerosols, the fecal\u2010oral route, and suspected mother\u2010to\u2010infant transmission.",

The clinical manifestations are asymptomatic or include fever, fatigue, and dry cough; a few patients have upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, and sore throat; and a few patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, stomachache, and diarrhea. From the current situation of pediatric cases, most of the clinical manifestations are relatively mild, with no fever or pneumonia, and have a good prognosis. Most children have recovered within 1 to 2 weeks, but some pediatric cases may progress to lower respiratory tract infection. The clinical classification of COVID\u20102019 is divided into four types. (a) Asymptomatic infection (recessive infection): the SARSCoV\u20102 etiology test is positive, but there are no corresponding clinical symptoms, and imaging examination is normal. (b) Acute upper respiratory tract infection: only fever, cough, pharyngeal pain, nasal obstruction, fatigue, headache, myalgia, or discomfort are observed. There is no pneumonia manifestation on imaging examination or pyemia. (c) Mild pneumonia: with or without fever and accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as cough; chest imaging examination shows pneumonia manifestations but does not reach the threshold of severe pneumonia. (d) Severe pneumonia: any of the following: (i) respiratory rate increase: RR \u2265 70 times/min under 1\u2010year old or RR \u2265 50 times/min over 1\u2010year old, excluding the effects of fever and crying; (ii) oxygen saturation <92%; (iii) manifestations of anoxia: auxiliary respiration (moaning, nasal flaring, and triretraction sign is positive), cyanosis, and intermittent apnea; (iv) disturbance of consciousness: drowsiness, coma, and convulsion; and (v) food refusal or feeding difficulty and dehydration signs. (e) Critically ill children: those who meet one of the following conditions and need ICU monitoring and treatment: (i) respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation; (ii) shock; and (iii) combination with other organ failures.\n4\n\n",

The condition of children is obviously milder, recovery faster, and have a better prognosis.\n5\n We observed that the SARSCoV\u20102 infection in the two children was characterized by familial aggregation, which further proved that SARSCoV\u20102 had the characteristics of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. And the conditions of the two cases were relatively mild, while the six adults who were in close contact with them all had symptoms such as high fever and dyspnea. Case 1 with SARSCoV\u20102 infection had only mild respiratory tract infection symptoms, the chest CT indicated pulmonary infection, and case 2 had no clinical manifestations of infection. The laboratory examination, including the blood test, CRP, liver, and kidney function and myocardial zymogram, and so forth of the two infected children were not significantly abnormal, which was different from the SARSCoV\u20102 infection in an adult. In addition to the symptoms of severe respiratory tract infection, most of the adult patients with different degrees of abnormal liver function. At present, there were no obvious manifestations of abnormal liver function among the children infected with infection in domestic reports.\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n Among the confirmed cases of the SARS, there were only 135 cases of infection in children, and there were no deaths in children under 12 years old. The MERS caused 2143 people infected and 750 fatal cases, while 11 children been confirmed to be infected with MERS, the symptoms were mild. The symptoms of children infected with SARSCoV\u20102 are mild or even asymptomatic, which may be its characteristic. With the wide application of pathogen detection, whether the number of cases in children will increase needs to be observed with more clinical data.",

            "text": "According to the current epidemiological data, the infection rate of SARSCoV\u20102 to children is low. Studies have demonstrated that SARSCoV\u20102 has a similar binding receptor and binding properties to SARS\u2010CoV, namely the S protein of coronavirus, which is mainly responsible for binding to the receptor protein of the infected host, enabling the virus to invade and infect host cells. Studies have shown that angiotensin\u2010converting\u2010enzyme\u20102 (ACE2) is the receptor protein of S protein, which provides evidence for human infection of SARSCoV\u20102.\n9\n, \n10\n The study\n11\n analyzed the mononuclear RNA sequencing data of more than 430 000 human lung cells (non\u2010SARSCoV\u20102 infection), and found that more than 80% of the ACE2 in the lung was distributed on the surface of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2). ACE2 is necessary for SARSCoV\u20102 to enter into cells and may be one of the receptors of SARSCoV\u20102. The reason for the low susceptibility of children to SARSCoV\u20102 may be related to the imperfect development and function of ACE2 protein, or the intracellular response induced by ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells of children is lower than that of adults. In addition, it may also be related to the imperfect innate immune development of children, and the subsequent low level of adaptive immune response.\n5\n The symptoms of COVID\u20102019 in children are mild which may be related to a reduce inflammatory response because the immune system in children is less well developed. Epidemiological studies show that 43 of 99 adults infected with SARSCoV\u20102 have different degrees of abnormal liver function. Further studies showed that the abnormal liver function of the patients infected with SARSCoV\u20102 may be caused by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons, but not related to the direct damage of hepatocytes.\n12\n, \n13\n In addition, children are susceptible to a variety of viruses, such as influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and rhinoviruses. Antibodies produced after infection may cross\u2010react with the coronaviruses to provide some protection. Further studies are needed to confirm whether these manifestations lead to differences in the clinical manifestations of children and adults were infected, whether there are still unexplored mechanisms.",

            "text": "The viral nucleic acid detection is still the only gold standard, but clinicians will cross verify according to clinical manifestations and CT images to improve the accuracy. Viral nucleic acid testing is high specificity, but low sensitivity and high technical requirements and the disease changes of pathogen carriers may limit the timeliness of nucleic acid testing. Studies have shown that infection can be limited to the lower respiratory tract. Diagnostic swab samples, which are obtained from the upper respiratory tract, can be negative in the context of typical chest CT findings. In addition, false\u2010negative results can be caused by the wrong collection method and the long storage time (degradation of viral nucleic acid). Early CT scanning may detect significant changes. The suspected diagnosis of children infected with SARSCoV\u20102 requires a clear epidemiological, including (a) travel or living history of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities with the patients within 14 days before the onset of the disease; (b) contact history with SARSCoV\u20102\u2010infected people (nucleic acid test is positive) within 14 days before the onset of the disease; (c) contacted the patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or from the community with the case report, have been within 14 days before the onset of the disease; (d) clustering occurrence. And two of the following three clinical manifestations can be diagnosed. The clinical manifestation: (a) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (b) early chest imaging examination showed multiple small patch shadows and interstitial changes, which were obvious in the peripheral lung, and then developed into multiple ground glass shadows and/or infiltrating shadows in both lungs. Lung consolidation and pleural effusion were rare in severe cases; (c) the total number of WBC in the early stage of the disease was normal or decreased, or the lymphocyte count was decreased. Confirmed cases need to have met one of the two conditions: (a) nucleic acid of SARSCoV\u20102 test in respiratory or blood samples is positive; (b) the viral gene sequencing of respiratory or blood samples is highly homologous with the SARSCoV\u20102.\n4\n This change clarifies the diagnosis of SARSCoV\u20102 infections in children, although a small number of cases need to be further assessed based on clinical dynamics.",
