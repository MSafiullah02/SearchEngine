Strategic work plans were then developed to guide the actions of the committee [12]. The European Commission worked on the adopted relevant Health Security Programme of co-operation on preparedness and response against biological and chemical threats, creating also mechanisms of communication during health security crises [3, 23]. The appearance of a global threat, such as the emergence of SARS in 2002, and the need of scientific coordination of complex assessment of threats affecting more than one country, elicited the decision of the EU in 2004 to create the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) with the mandate of strengthening the preparedness and response against health threats in the EU [21].",

Even though this is the most common model, this structure may vary between countries. At EU level, the European Commission is responsible for all management aspects of infectious diseases, whereas the ECDC is in charge of the assessment of public health threats and the provision of technical expertise to member states. In the area of crisis management, the European Commission and the specialised agencies of the EU maintain and support a number of monitoring and alert systems for threat detection, risk assessment, rapid alert and risk management (Table 7.1) and platforms for crisis management, all of which provide means for information exchange and dissemination, as well as coordination with member states and international organizations (Table 7.2).\n\n",

In their relationship with security sector and law enforcement authorities, public health services stress the importance of keeping public health high on the agenda in cases of a deliberate release of biological agents. However, in response to a health crisis resulting from a deliberate release of a biological agent, EU coordination is faced with two contradicting forces in the communication with the member states: on the one hand some member states would be requesting urgent advice, guidance and possibly assistance, while on the other hand there will be marked reluctance by the security sector to discuss sensitive information.",

These two autochthonous cases of dengue fever were clustered in space and time suggesting an on-going local transmission of dengue. In response to this event, the French authorities have strengthened entomological surveillance in the infested regions and vector control activities in the areas where the cases were reported. Active case finding was implemented in the neighbourhood where cases resided. Communication campaigns for the general public and health professionals also took place [14].",

The patient spent 2 weeks in the beginning of August in Podobuce/Orebi\u0107 on the Pelje\u0161ac peninsula, 60 km northwest from Dubrovnik, in the southern part of the country. Considering the onset of symptoms and the incubation period of the disease, the patient was most likely infected during his stay in Croatia [22]. The national health authorities of Croatia took adequate control measures, including raising awareness among health professionals, strengthening human and vector surveillance, implementation of control measures, and communication of personal protective measures to the public. On 22 October 2010 one more case with febrile illness was identified through active case finding in the same village where the infected tourist resided. In addition, 9 of 14 blood samples of healthy individuals living in close proximity suggested recent infection with dengue virus. Further evidence of autochthonous transmission was suggested following a sero-prevalence survey using a random sample of the population living in the area. Five per cent of tested individuals had laboratory indication of recent infection [8, 10].",

The conclusion was that the detection of two autochthonous cases of dengue fever in France and the first autochthonous case in Croatia were significant public health events, but not unexpected. The described events have been the first locally acquired dengue cases reported in continental Europe since 1927\u20131928, when large dengue outbreaks occurred in Greece. All cases in 2010 occurred in areas known to be infested by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Previous events, including the chikungunya outbreak in Italy in 2007 [1], the occurrence of vector-borne diseases around airports and other ports of entry, and a previous risk assessment on dengue introduction in the EU [15] indicate that autochthonous transmission of dengue in continental Europe is possible, as confirmed by these events. At the end of the period of mosquito activity, usually in October/November, the risk of establishment of sustained transmission of dengue in south-eastern France and in southern Croatia and further spread in Europe during 2010 appeared very limited. These two events highlighted the need to further strengthen vector monitoring, active surveillance for imported and autochthonous human cases, awareness of health care providers, and laboratory capacities, in countries where Aedes albopictus is present, and increase the effectiveness of rapid exchange of information among countries to identify threats and support the response.",

Samples of heroin were tested in Scotland in order to identify a possible contaminated batch, but did not yield any positive results. Considering the complex international distribution chain of heroin and the laboratory confirmed link between strains of Bacillus anthracis in Scotland and Germany, the exposure to a contaminated batch of heroin distributed in several EU member states seemed probable. However, the source could not be identified and additional cases occurred over the course of the year from the three initially affected areas. Even though skin and soft tissue infections in injecting drug users are common, anthrax as the cause of such infection, especially when fatal, is rare, and very few cases have been described so far [16, 19].",
