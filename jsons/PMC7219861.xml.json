This report provides a detailed account of the hybrid model adopted by the NYU Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and how they incorporated care of noncritically ill COVID-19 medical patients onto their own (still active) orthopaedic trauma service with oversight by Family Medicine.3 I commend the authors for their bravery and work on the front lines in what has become the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014New York City.",

Orthopaedic surgeons must be prepared to continue serving patients with urgent (and eventually nonurgent) musculoskeletal needs, but many may also be called upon to go back to their roots as medical doctors and help in ways that they may not have envisioned revisiting. Articles like this can help to inform us as we make our way through these challenging times.",
