The acute episode is characterized by deterioration in consciousness, often with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Additionally, symmetric multifocal brain lesions are seen in the bilateral thalami as well as other characteristic regions, involving both gray and white matter. Prognosis is variable, with a high mortality rate and most surviving patients having persistent neurologic deficits. Early treatment with high dose steroids is associated with a more favorable outcome, however the diagnosis is often overlooked resulting in delayed treatment. The RANBP2 mutation associated with ANE1 causes an incompletely penetrant predisposition to encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness through a mechanism that remains elusive. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses suggesting possible etiologies for this phenotype based on the many functions of RANBP2 within the cell. These include dysfunctions in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and intracellular metabolic regulation, as well as cytokine storm, and abnormal distribution of mitochondria. This narrative review explores these key concepts of the RANBP2 mutation and its clinical and therapeutic implications in pediatric populations.",

This phase includes deteriorating consciousness, with rapid progression to coma, and can be accompanied by seizures and focal neurologic deficits [2] [3] [4] . A summary of the clinical spectrum of the disorder from pooled studies is presented in Table 1 . The latter two findings are often dependent on the location and burden of lesions. These neurologic symptoms can be associated with systemic symptoms as well [5, 6] . Across two studies with a total of 18 children with ANE approximately 62% were found to have elevated transaminases and 12% with findings suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [7, 8] .

In fact, half of patients with ANE1 will have at least one additional episode [9] . Positive family history can include affected relatives beyond first-degree relatives. Often, prior episodes of encephalopathy with preceding illness in the patient or family members may not have been diagnosed as ANE. Specifically, other personal or familial episodes may be labeled as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), cerebellitis, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, aseptic meningitis, viral encephalitis, or 'non-classic' Leigh syndrome [10] . Interestingly, patients with ANE1 have not been reported to have transaminitis or DIC as is commonly observed in patients with ANE [1]. There have been no studies assessing the association of ANE1 episodes with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies although this could potentially be a close mimic as well, especially in young children [11] .",

A distinguishing neuroradiographic finding amongst patients with ANE1, as demonstrated in the figures, is that there is a higher predilection for lesions in the bilateral thalami and pons as opposed to more diffuse findings [12] [13] . Less frequently lesions can be found in the cervical spinal cord, cerebellum, medial temporal lobes or insular cortex, and other subcortical regions including mammillary bodies, hippocampus, amygdala, claustrum, and external capsule. These multifocal lesions are typically symmetric, but can be asymmetric [10, 12] . Further, lesions may evolve over the course of the disease, progressing from edema, to petechial hemorrhage, to necrosis.

Several larger studies investigating influenza infection have noted a small percentage of cases meet criteria for ANE (3) (4) (5) .7%) although detailed genetic testing for RANBP2 mutation is infrequent in these studies [16] [17] . This finding is notable in that influenza triggered encephalitides may have nearly identical neuroimaging findings but different clinical courses, highlighting the complexities of the geneenvironment interface. For this reason, even if influenza is identified as the causative agent for ANE, additional genetic testing for RANBP2 is warranted.",

Better outcome is associated with unilateral thalamic lesions and reversal of lesions on imaging [12, 25] .

            "text": "RANBP2 has many functions within a cell that could potentially be affected by the mutation, resulting in this disease, including interactions with mitochondria, metabolism, and nuclear signaling, with potential effects on viral invasion directly. Many functions of RANBP2 are exerted through its interaction with Ran GTPase, though mitochondrial trafficking is Ran GTPase-independent [41] . Unsurprisingly, in most cases of ANE1 evidence of infection and inflammatory cell infiltration are not found in the CSF, suggesting the symptoms in ANE1 are not a direct effect of the infectious process itself. However, cytokines such as TNF alpha and IL6 are found to be elevated in the serum and/or CSF of patients with ANE1 [42] [43] [44] . One prominent hypothesis of the etiology of ANE1 is that this encephalopathy is secondary to cytokine storm due to abnormal nuclear signaling, one of the important functions of RANBP2, with cytokines gaining access to the central nervous system as a result of disruption of the blood brain barrier [6] . Consistent with this theory, in a motor neuron disease model with loss of RANBP2 in motor neurons, loss of this protein disrupts movement of nuclear transport receptors by the Ran GTPase, impacting proteostasis and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, ultimately resulting in substrate accumulation and delocalization [45] . RANBP2 is also found to regulate chemokine signaling by controlling the generation and regulation of components of the signaling pathway including, Stat3, Cxcr4 and its ligands Cxcl14/Cxcl12, as well as Metalloproteinase 28 [45] . These are implicated in proinflammatory signaling, however there was no evidence of macroglia or microglia activation associated with this finding [45] . Notably in ANE1, elevated CSF cytokines are not accompanied by elevations in inflammatory cells and, on autopsy the parenchymal changes appreciated are out of proportion to observed inflammation [12] . Also important to note is that the same inflammatory cytokines are elevated in influenza-associated encephalopathy, resulting in a different phenotype, suggesting that this cannot be the only mechanism behind the pathogenesis of ANE1 [10] .",

Thus, severity and duration of fever, could potentially contribute to reduced penetrance although this has not been directly studied. One patient, who was not tested for RANBP2 gene mutation, was found to have a thermolabile phenotype of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II variants, resulting in vulnerability to temperature sensitive encephalopathy [48] . Although difficult to extrapolate to patients with genetically confirmed ANE1, individual variability of fever between patients could play a role in the incomplete penetrance seen in this disease but more study is needed. Additionally, individual differences in immune system components may contribute to this feature [1].",

Similarly, the use of immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis would not address the presumed pathologic disturbances reported in ANE1, underscoring why these therapies have not been found to have therapeutic impact in such cases. Based on the pathophysiology of the disease, there may be a role for targeted therapies such as IL6 or TNF alpha inhibition, but studies on these targeted biologics are limited, with only one pediatric case series being reported to have benefit from the use of tocilizumab when administered with corticosteroids [51] .
