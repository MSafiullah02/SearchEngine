In response to the situation, the Chinese government has marshalled the full resources and efforts of the country to reduce the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. As the number of confirmed cases decreases considerably every day, China's control approach for COVID-19 epidemic has been proven to be agile and productive (National Health Commission, 2020; WHO, 2020b) . Among all interventions, operating Chinese mobile cabin hospitals is considered one of the most effective measures because it holds many patients simultaneously at the outbreak stage; as such, this strategy quickly and effectively contains the spread of the virus (WHO, 2020b; Zhang, 2020b) .",

High structure space is the basic premise of the mobile cabin hospital because it can decrease the risk of virus spreading through the air. In China, large-span buildings, such as industrial plants and stadiums, were selected to be renovated into mobile cabin hospitals. At most, 3000 patients can be accommodated in the hospital, for which, effective measures should be considered to prevent cross infections. BIM tools were used to simulate instantaneous airflow and pollutant dispersion and optimize the space arrangement of mobile cabin hospitals to keep from the spread of infections. In addition, a distributed indoor environmental monitoring system was recommended to improve the operation of ventilation systems and purification equipment.",

In Chinese mobile cabin hospitals, each health care worker who manages an average of 50 patients bears a heavy psychological and physiologic burden (Zhang, 2020a) . Smart devices can become important alternatives of some manual workload. For instance, intelligent robots were used in some mobile cabin hospitals to perform some transportation activities, such as drug delivery and garbage disposal. Wristbands can also be applied to regularly and automatically collect physical indicators, such as temperature and blood oxygen, of each patient. Wearable technologies can trace patients' behavioral trajectories in real time. If a patient enters a prohibited area, such as a medical waste area, then the patient and management personnel can be warned or reminded in accordance with the activity information.",

Isolating and taking care of patients timely are still the most effective measures in the absence of a well-proven specific vaccine or drug for coronavirus. To overcome the shortage of medical resources and high risk of cross infection, intelligent technologies have taken irreplaceable role when operating the mobile cabin hospitals. In the past 10 days, COVID-19 has swept through more than 100 countries, causing dozens of increases in the number of confirmed cases outside China (WHO, 2020c). Experiences learned from the operation of mobile cabin hospitals can provide guidance for China in responding to other major public health emergencies in the future as well as valuable insights for coping with the COVID-19 epidemic in other affected countries.",
