            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has reached pandemic proportions, because most infected individuals remain asymptomatic and undocumented [1], which facilitates the rapid dissemination of the virus across borders [2]. Within few weeks, SARS-CoV-2 has infected hundred thousands people in over 200 countries, albeit the numbers increase at a different pace in certain countries (Fig. 1). Singapore, like other Asian countries, installed effective containment measures early, which turned out effective in keeping case numbers low from the start (Singapore) or helped to escape the exponential increase in new infections at some point, e.g. in South Korea and Wuhan, China (Fig. 1) [3, 4]. For the uncertainties about the pathogenicity of SARS-Cov-2 compared to influenza virus Europe did not install strict containment measures early, so that since February 21, the numbers of infected people closely keep following an exponential trend (R0 = 2\u20133, Figs. 1 and 2) [5]. Italy has been most affected and only gradually installed nation-wide containment measures up to a complete lockdown on March 9. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe kept hesitating and started to install drastic containment measures not before March 15 so the basic reproduction number (R0) has remained > 2 (Fig. 2). A persistent R0 of > 2 implies that each infected individual keeps infecting more than two others, i.e. an ongoing exponential increase in infection numbers enforcing the epidemic, with all its consequences on healthcare system overload and mortality.",

Assuming that the definition of full nationwide lockdown was reached in Denmark on March 11, in Germany, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Austria, Ireland, Poland, and Czech Republic on March 15, and in Switzerland on March 16, the different delays in the starting a complete lockdown compared to Wuhan/Hubei, China and what happens in Italy are shown in Fig. 1.
