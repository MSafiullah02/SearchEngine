A set of clinical and laboratory criteria necessary for an ideal diagnostic marker of infection have previously been proposed by Ng and his colleagues [1]. According these criteria, an ideal biomarker should possess at a minimum the following characteristics: (a) biochemically, a biomarker should be stable and remain significantly deregulated in the body fluid compartment for at least 12\u201324 h even after commencement of appropriate treatment that may allow an adequate time window for specimen collection or storage without significant decomposition of the active compound until laboratory processing; (b) its concentration should be determined quantitatively and the method of measurement should be automatic, rapid, easy, and inexpensive; (c) the collection of a specimen should be minimally invasive and require a small volume (e.g., <0.5 mL blood). Numerous biomarkers have been found and tested in clinical practice. Currently, microRNA (miRNA) molecules are without a doubt the biomarkers with the greatest potential capacities in the diagnostic microbiology field.",

In the nucleus, ribonuclease Drosha cleaves pri-miRNAs and releases 60\u201380-nt stem-loop intermediate structures named pre-miRNAs. The pre-miRNAs are transported to cytoplasm by exportin-5 protein, and then are cleaved by Dicer RNase III to form a mature double-stranded miRNA. One strand of the miRNA duplex is subsequently unwound and then incorporated into an effector protein complex termed RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is responsible for the gene silencing in a posttranscriptional manner [4\u20136]. Mature miRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 19\u201325 nucleotides in length. Through partial homology to the 3\u2032-untranscribed region (UTR) in target mRNAs, miRNAs control of gene expression via repression of translation as well as reducing mRNA levels directly.",

Recently, virus-encoded miRNAs have been discovered; these miRNAs may function as controls for viral replication and thus limit antiviral responses, inhibit apoptosis, and stimulate cellular growth [7]. Moreover, unique host cell miRNAs expression profiles have been revealed in response to various microbial infections [8, 9]. Host miRNA appears to play a role in viral replication and may be used by host cells to control viral infection.",

Some of these miRNAs appear to be enriched in specific fluids [10, 11]. These circulating miRNAs subsequently have become the focus of ongoing research. The properties, origin, function, and relationship with disease of circulating miRNAs have been intensively explored. A number of important observations have been noted. Circulating miRNAs are present in a stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity [12, 13]. Some groups also reported a higher stability of miRNAs compared to mRNA in samples obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues [14\u201316]. The expression level of miRNAs has been noted as consistent among individuals of the same species [12]. Expression alteration of circulating miRNAs has been reported to be associated with pathophysiological states including various cancers, heart disease, pregnancy, and diabetes [17, 18]. Needless to say, serum, plasma, and other body fluid specimens are generally available for clinical testing. Profiling hundreds of miRNA requires only 200 \u03bcL sera [13]. Thus, these unique and stable characteristics of circulating miRNAs potentially make them extremely useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.",

Bewilderingly, more than 95 % of the virus-encoded miRNAs known today are of herpesvirus origin. Moreover, almost all virus-encoded miRNAs are encoded by DNA viruses except those encoded by retroviruses (HIV-1), which reverse-transcribe and integrate their genetic material into host DNA.

Viral miRNAs modulate expression of host gene involved in cell proliferation and survival, stress responses, and antiviral defense pathways, which are pivotal for viral replication. Another primary function of virus miRNAs is to regulate the latent-lytic switch. During latency, the host cell maintains the viral genome and only a limited portion of virus genome is expressed. Viral gene expression is restricted, but virus miRNAs and their precursors are regularly detected [24]. There is an accumulating amount of evidence that has demonstrated that virus-encoded miRNAs mediate evolutionarily conserved functions (e.g., immune evasion, cell cycle control, and promotion of latency, etc.). The miRNAs themselves show poorly primary sequence conservation [25]. These phenomena raise an important question: can viral miRNAs be used as the detection maker for virus infection during the latent infection phase despite the fact that little or no viral protein is being produced? Further studies are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Northern blotting was the first technique used to detect miRNAs and is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for characterizing miRNA expression. The basic procedures of miRNA northern blotting are similar to traditional blotting and are done as follows: (a) the small RNA molecules are separated by using high percentage denaturing urea\u2013acrylamide gels rather than the usual agarose electrophoresis gels; (b) the small RNA molecules are transferred from the gel onto a membrane; (c) the miRNA molecules are fixed on the membrane through various cross-linking procedures; (d) the membrane is hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Northern blotting methods are able to determine the absolute amount of miRNA in a sample by blotting a dilution series of synthetic oligo miRNA molecules of known concentrations in parallel with the sample. The concentration of miRNA in the sample can be calculated by a standard curve obtained from the dilution series. However, short length as well as low prevalence of mature miRNA molecules can lead to poor sensitivity of such routine northern analysis. It requires a large amount of total RNA for each sample (generally, more than 5 \u03bcg). Other disadvantages of this method include low throughput and potential environment hazards of radiolabeling. Several technical modifications have been used to improve detection sensitivity. LNA (locked nucleic acid)-modified oligonucleotide probes increases the affinity between LNA probes and target miRNA which results at least tenfold increase of sensitivity [55]. Using soluble carbodiimide cross-linking method increases the efficiency of miRNA that are fixed on the membrane, which can increase by 25\u201350-fold miRNA detection sensitivity compared to the traditional UV cross-linking method [56].",

The small size of the mature miRNA sequences as well as sequence homology between the mature and precursor miRNA forms limits the direct application of conventional RT-PCR protocols to miRNA detection. To solve these problems, innovative solutions have been applied for each step of qRT-PCR used for the quantitative analysis of miRNAs. The first step in qRT-PCR of miRNAs is the accurate and complete conversion of miRNA into cDNA. Two different approaches for reverse transcription of miRNAs have been reported. In the first approach, miRNAs are reverse transcribed individually by using miRNAs-specific reverse transcription primers. Both stem-loop (Applied Biosystems Co, Fig. 46.1a) and a linear primer (Exiqon, Fig. 46.1b) containing partial complementary sequence of 3\u2032-end of miRNA can be annealed to miRNA in order to prime the reverse transcription. The double stranded structure of the stem-loop primer prevents its nonspecific binding to pre- and pri-miRNAs, thereby increasing the specificity of the assay. Unlike stem-loop primer, the design of the linear primer is simpler. But the linear primer cannot discriminate mature miRNA from their precursors.\n",

Then, a primer consisting of an oligo(dT) sequence with a universal primer-binding sequence at its 5\u2032-end or a universal primer complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the linker is used to prime reverse transcription [53]. The universal reverse primer sequence is introduced into the cDNA during reverse transcription.

LNA modification is a widely used method for increasing the Tm and the specificity of primer.

One approach uses SYBR Green dye whose fluorescence increases approximately 100-times upon intercalating into dsDNA chain; this property is used to monitor real time amplification products as they accumulate during the PCR reaction. One limitation of the SYBR Green-based method is that target PCR products and nonspecific products cannot be discriminated. Therefore, a melting point analysis usually required following the PCR amplification, which can be reached by using a dual-labeled hydrolysis TaqMan probe. The basis for this type of TaqMan probe detection has been reviewed by Benes and Castoldi [53]. The characteristics of TaqMan miRNA assays make them ideally suited for detection of mature miRNAs. Moreover, these TaqMan miRNA assays can discriminate related miRNAs that differ in only one nucleotide. However, the cost of the TaqMan probes is higher than the SYBR Green method, which limits its routine use in most laboratories.",

To solve this problem, two techniques, LNA utilization or adjusting the lengths of the probes, have been successfully used to normalize Tm value [61, 62].

Many methods have been developed to label miRNA, and these can be classified into two main categories: direct labeling and indirect labeling. Direct labeling with fluorescent dye can be accomplished enzymatically. Currently used methods including labeling through poly(A) polymerase, labeling though T4 RNA ligase, guanine labeling, and labeling microRNA through a RNA-primed array-based Klenow enzyme assay (RAKE). Fluorescent dye also can conjugate with adjacent 3\u2032-OH of mature miRNAs using a chemical reagent [63, 64]. Indirect labeling methods including labeling through miRNA reverse transcript, the RT-PCR product of miRNA or the in vitro transcript of miRNA. The advantages of indirect labeling are obvious, since the reverse transcription product of miRNAs are more stable and easy to preserve. In addition, miRNA can be amplified and labeled synchronously through PCR or in vitro transcription, which is very useful for low-abundance miRNAs. Although direct labeling is simple, this method has inherent problems including the fact that guanine labeling is not suitable for miRNAs lacking G residues, that T4 ligase labeling can introduce base bias, and that the procedure of chemical labeling is somewhat complicated. Though indirect labeling is more sensitive, this method may introduce artificial errors during the ligation and PCR amplification procedures.",

The principle of NGS has been described in other chapter of this book and elsewhere [66, 67]. Currently, three main platforms are in widespread use for miRNA profiling and discovery: the Roche (454) GS FLX sequencer, the Illumina Genome Analyzer and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencer.

One disadvantage of NGS to comprehensively profile mRNA expression is that this technique is rather expensive compared to microArray though its cost has significantly decreased with the development of commercial platforms. Another limitation of NGS is that the read length is relatively short (35\u2013500 bp) compared to traditional capillary sequencing (1,000\u20131,200 bp).

Marquez et al. measured miR-122 and miR-21 levels in HCV-infected human liver biopsies relative to uninfected human livers and correlated these with clinical patient data [76]. They found that miR-21 expression correlated with viral load, fibrosis and serum liver transaminase levels. miR-122 expression inversely correlated with fibrosis, liver transaminase levels and patient age. While Morita et al. described hepatic miR-122 expression was weakly and positively correlated with the serum HCV load but was not correlated with HCV load in the human liver [77].",

Serum miR-122 levels correlated well with markers of liver inflammatory activity, that is, the serum levels of alanine leucine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase, and the histologic activity index (HAI) score. In patients with persistently normal ALT levels, serum miR-122 levels did not differ from healthy controls. There was no correlation of serum miR-122 levels with serum albumin, international normalized ratio, liver fibrosis, or serum HCV RNA. Thus, serum miR-122 appears to act as a biomarker of necroinflammation in patients with chronic Hepatitis C infection.",

A total of 64 miRNAs were found whose expression levels changed for more than twofold in response to EV71 infection [78]. Ho et al. found upregulation of miR-141 upon enterovirus infection can facilitate viral propagation by expediting the translational switch [79]. We recently compared host serum miRNA levels in patients with hand-foot-and-mouth disease caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CVA16) as well as in other microbial infections and in healthy individuals. Among 664 different miRNAs analyzed using a miRNA array, 102 were upregulated and 26 were downregulated in sera of patients with enteroviral infections. Expression levels of ten candidate miRNAs were further evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR assays. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that six miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-143, miR-324-3p, miR-628-3p, miR-140-5p, and miR-362-3p) were able to discriminate patients with enterovirus infections from healthy controls with area under curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.828 to 0.934. The combined six miRNA using multiple logistic regression analysis provided not only a sensitivity of 97.1 % and a specificity of 92.7 % but also a unique profile that differentiated enteroviral infections from other microbial infections. Expression levels of five miRNAs (miR-148a, miR-143, miR-324-3p, miR-545, and miR-140-5p) were significantly increased in patients with CVA16 versus those with EV71 (p  <  0.05). Combination of miR-545, miR-324-3p, and miR-143 possessed a moderate ability to discrimination between CVA16 and EV71 with an AUC value of 0.761. These data indicate that sera from patients with different subtypes of enteroviral infection express unique miRNA profiles. Serum miRNA expression profiles may provide supplemental biomarkers for diagnosing and subtyping enteroviral hand-foot-and-mouth disease infections [80].",

There have a considerable way to go before being used in clinical practice. Several issues should be refined in this field. (a) Source material should be fixed. Plasma, serum, whole blood, and isolated exosomes or microvesicles have been used as the source for miRNA profiling. Advantages and disadvantages of each approach should be considered ahead. (b) Though differences in circulating miRNAs between males and females have not been found with the exception of differences associated with pregnancy [81, 82], miRNA levels in plasma and serum from a large number of normal individuals of both genders and various ages, even same individual over time should be extensively studied. (c) No acknowledged reference genes have been found in serum/plasma. Frequently used endogenous controls, such as miR-16, dysregulated in some diseases and RNU6B degraded in serum. Spiking into RNA isolation process with synthetic exogenous miRNA only act as normalizers for differences in recovery between samples. (d) The methods of miRNA quantification including RNA isolation should be standardized, since interplatform reproducibility among different platforms is low. (e) There seems to be a lack of specificity when using single miRNA as biomarker, since the miRNA is commonly regulated in various diseases. A panel of miRNAs should be a best choice.",
