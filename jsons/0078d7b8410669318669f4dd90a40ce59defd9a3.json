Social distance, isolation or quarantine are essential measures to help prevent coronavirus transmission -however, these strategies, and the pandemic outbreak itself, have been associated with negative emotions, such as irritability, anxiety, fear, sadness, anger or boredom (Ornell et al., 2020) . These conditions are known to trigger relapse, even in those long-term abstainers, or intensify drug consumption (Serafini et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2009) . Withdrawal symptoms elicited during lockdown could also jeopardize these preventive strategies, as it could drive individuals to go outside for drugs. In addition, medical assistance for these symptoms will be limited, since the major medical efforts are geared towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in the case of hospitalization, it may be difficult to maintain voluntary stay, generating more stress to healthcare workers, already overburdened because of the pandemic. Homelessness can also compromise preventive strategies, as individuals tend to wander during the day and sleep in crowded places during the night, making them potential vectors of transmission. Social distancing is also challenged during incarceration, permanence in therapeutic communities or other addiction treatment facilities, many of which philanthropic institutions without complying to health security standards. These are conditions highly prevalent among substance users, and may require specific strategies that encompass the individual's needs for prevention of COVID-19, SUD treatment and the protection of healthcare workers (Volkow, 2020) . In all these scenarios, drug seeking behaviors could increase exposure to infection for addicts, their families and healthcare professionals.",
