These changes are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. Due to either limited fidelity of the replication apparatus copying the genome or physico-chemical activity of the environment, nucleotides may be changed, inserted, or deleted. Genomes of other origin may also be a source of innovation for a genome through the use of specially evolved mechanisms of genetic exchange (recombination). Accepted changes, known as mutations, may be neutral, advantageous, or deleterious, and depending on the population size and environment, the mutant lineage may proliferate or go extinct. Overall, advantageous mutations and large population size increase the chances for a lineage to succeed. The fitness of a lineage is constantly re-assessed in the ever-changing environment and lineages that, due to mutation, became a success in the past could be unfit in the new environment. Due to the growing number of mutations accumulating in the genomes, lineages diverge over time, although occasionally, due to stochastic reasons or under similar selection pressure, they may converge.",

Phylogeny deals with past events and, therefore, it is reconstructed by quantification of differences accumulated between lineages. Due to the lack of fossils and (relatively) high mutation rates, viruses were not considered to provide a recoverable part of phylogeny until the advent of molecular data proved otherwise. Comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and, occasionally, other quantitative characteristics such as distances between three-dimensional structures of biopolymers, have been used to reconstruct virus phylogenies. Results of phylogenetic analysis are typically depicted in the form of a tree that may be used as a synonym for phylogeny. For instance, the all-inclusive phylogeny of cellular species is known as the Tree of Life (ToL) (Fig. 1A\n). More recently, two techniques, networks and forests of trees, are used to depict the complexity of phylogenetic relations and the uncertainty of phylogenetic inference, respectively.",

For inferring phylogeny, differences between the sequences of species members, assumed to be of a discernable common origin, are analyzed. If species in all lineages evolve at a uniform constant rate, like clocks tick, their evolution conforms to a molecular clock model. The utility of this model in relation to viruses may be very limited. Rather, related virus lineages may evolve at different and fluctuating rates and some sites may mutate repeatedly, including reverse substitutions. As a result, reconstruction of a full record of change at all sites is associated with ever increasing uncertainty with each new mutation. Furthermore, the accumulation of inter-species residue differences may progress nonlinearly with the time elapsed. At present, our understanding of these parameters of virus evolution is poor and this limits our ability to assess the fit between a reconstructed phylogeny and the true phylogeny, with the latter practically remaining unknown for most virus isolates. This gap in our knowledge does not undermine the conceptual strength and utility of phylogenetic analysis for reconstructing the relationships between biological species including viruses.",

For instance, cellular species form three (or two) compact domains (kingdoms) and their origin can be traced back to a common ancestor in the ToL, using either ribosomal RNA or a common set of single-copy genes. Such inference is not feasible for viruses due to their diversity and the lack of a universal molecular denominator (trait). Thus, reconstructing the comprehensive virus phylogeny may require comparisons that involve genomes of viral and cellular origins. This formidable task remains largely \u2018work in progress\u2019. In fact, most efforts in virus phylogeny are invested in reconstructing the relationships at the micro, rather than grand, scale and they focus on well-sampled lineages that have practical (e.g., medical) relevance. Most recently, due to the advent of high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) and metagenomics, phylogeny of distant relations to characterize diverse viromes and the entire Virosphere has become an active area of research.

The entire process of generating contemporary species diversity from a common ancestor is believed to proceed through a chain of intermediate ancestors specific for different subsets of the analyzed species (Fig. 2\n). Typically, these ancestral sequences are estimated internally during the tree building process or are not required at all, depending on the method used. The relationship between the common ancestor, intermediate ancestors, and contemporary species may be likened to the relationship between, respectively, root, internal nodes, and terminal nodes (leaves) of a tree, an abstraction that is widely used for the visualization of this relationship (Fig. 2). Alignment of the contemporary sequences with the reconstructed tree side by side, like shown for the toy example in Fig. 2, may reveal the full chain of sequence changes that have happened during evolution which, however, is rarely the case for real data sets due to repeated substitutions and incomplete species sampling. Trees are also part of graph theory, a branch of mathematics, whose apparatus is used in phylogeny. Formally and due to a strong link between phylogeny and taxonomy, leaves may be called operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and internal nodes and roots, since they have not been directly observed, are known as hypothetical taxonomy units (HTUs).

The topology is determined by relative positions of internal and terminal nodes; it defines branching events leading to contemporary species diversity. If two or more trees obtained for different data sets feature a common topology, these trees are called congruent. The branch length of a tree may define either the amount of change fixed or the time passed between two nodes connected in a tree, and is known as \u2018additive\u2019 or \u2018ultrametric\u2019, respectively (Fig. 3B and C). The tree shape may be linked to particulars of the evolutionary process and reflect changes in population size and diversity due to genetic drift and natural selection. The position of the root at the tree defines the direction of evolution. Species that descend from an internal node in a rooted tree form a lineage (cluster) and the node is called most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the lineage that thus has a monophyletic origin (Fig. 2).

The quality of alignment is among the most significant factors affecting the quality of phylogenetic inference. Due to the redundancy of the genetic code, changes in polynucleotide sequences are accumulated at a higher rate than those in amino acid sequences. In viruses, including RNA viruses, this difference is not counterbalanced by other local or global constraints on variation of genomes that are linked to e.g. di-nucleotide frequency or RNA secondary (tertiary) structure. Because of these differences, polynucleotide sequences are commonly used for phylogeny reconstruction of only those species that are closely related, while protein sequences, preserving better phylogenetic signal, may be used to infer phylogeny of distantly related species.",

The respective methods dealing with these quantitative characteristics are known as distance and discrete (character state). The distance methods are praised for their speed and are considered a technique of choice for analysis of very large data sets, although character state methods caught up in this respect due to recent algorithmic advancements (see also below). Distance methods are often designed to converge on a unique phylogeny by clustering, with none others being even considered. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) in which a constantly recalculated distance matrix is used to define the hierarchy of similarities through systematic and stepwise merging of most similar pairs at a time was the first technique introduced for clustering. The neighbor-joining (NJ) method uses a more sophisticated algorithm of clustering that minimizes branch lengths, and is the most popular among distance methods.",

Due to the calculation time involved, assessing all possible phylogenies is found to be impractical for data sets including more than 10 sequences; for larger data sets different heuristic approximations are used that may not guarantee a recovered phylogeny to be the best overall. There are two major criteria for selecting the best phylogeny using character-state based information through either maximum parsimony (MP) or maximum likelihood (ML). In MP analysis, a phylogeny with a minimal number of substitutions separating the analyzed species is sought. The ML analysis offers a statistical framework for comparing the likelihood of fitting different trees to the data under competing models of evolution with parameters including population size change and rate of mutation in search for one with the best fit. The latter approach is mathematically robust and its statistical power may also be used in combination with other techniques of tree generation. Recently, a Bayesian variant of the ML approach has gained popularity. It can utilize prior knowledge about the evolutionary process, like known substitution rates or clustering of species subsets or dates of species isolation, in combination with repeated sampling from subsequently derived hypotheses. The result of a Bayesian analysis is thus a forest of trees that reflects the uncertainty associated with the reconstructed phylogeny and which forms the basis to derive a consensus tree and statistic support for its branches. In phylogenetic analysis of viruses the dates of species isolation are often used to date the MRCA of the analyzed viruses under a Bayesian framework, while fossil information is routinely used to time-calibrate trees of cellular organisms. Bayesian methods have the highest computational cost due to their sampling approach and thus show the lowest speed, while realization of the similarly advanced ML algorithm may be largely comparable in speed to distance methods, allowing for the phylogenetic analysis of very large data sets like genome-wide tree reconstructions of cellular organisms or thousands of viruses.",

None of the methods is considered superior to the other methods with respect to all aspects of phylogeny reconstruction, and which method to use under what circumstances is often a point of debate.

Each internal node in the original tree is characterized by a so-called bootstrap value that is equal to the number of times a node appears in all tested trees.

Commonly, this knowledge comes in the form of a single or more species which are assumed (or known) to have emerged before the \u2018birth\u2019 of the analyzed cluster. These early diverged species are collectively defined as \u2018outgroup\u2019, while the analyzed species may be called \u2018in group\u2019 (Fig. 3B, C). Also, a tree may be generated unrooted, a common practice in phylogenetic analysis of viruses for which the applicability of the molecular clock model remains largely untested and reliable outgroups may not be routinely available (Fig. 4). In an unrooted tree, grouping of species in separate clusters may be apparent, although these clusters may not be treated as monophyletic as long as the direction of evolution has not been defined.

For viruses with small genomes or for a diverse set of viruses, it is common practice to use a single gene to infer virus phylogeny.

In phylogenetic terms, this violation may be revealed through incongruency of trees built for different genome regions (Fig. 3F). Trees may also become incongruent due to various technical reasons related to the size and diversity of a virus data set. These characteristics complicate interpretation of the congruency test, which is widely used in different programs to identify recombination in viruses. Other pitfalls of phylogenetic reconstruction include the inability to resolve basal branching patterns of highly divergent lineages (Fig. 3D) and the relatively close clustering of lineages that are only distantly related and do not form a monophyletic group in the true (unknown) phylogeny (Fig. 3E).

For instance, recombination was found to be extremely uncommon in the evolution of HCV, but not for poliovirus lineages that recombine promiscuously, also with closely related human coxsackie A viruses, both of which belong to the same virus species of human enteroviruses known as Enterovirus C.",

This was the case with many emerging infections including those caused by Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), ebolavirus, and Zika virus. In the case of SARS-CoV, poor sampling of the coronavirus diversity in the lineage at the time, some uncertainty over the relationship between phylogeny and taxonomy of coronaviruses, and the complexity of phylogenetic analysis of a virus data set including isolated distant lineages led to considerable controversy over the exact evolutionary position of SARS-CoV among coronaviruses. Since then, the matter has fully been resolved but this experience illustrates some challenges in inferring virus phylogeny.",

In this quest, phylogenetic analysis canalizes the effort and provides crucial information for reconstructing parameters of major evolutionary events that promoted the virus origin and spread. For instance, intertwining HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) lineages in the primate lentivirus tree led to the postulation that the existing diversity of HIV in the human population originated from several ancestral viruses independently introduced from primates over a number of years. Similar phylogenetic reasoning was used to trace the origin of a local HIV outbreak to a common source of HIV introduction through dental practice (known as \u2018HIV dentist\u2019 case). These are typical examples illustrating the utility of phylogenetic analysis for epidemiological and forensic studies.",

Identification of West Nile virus in the USA illustrates a geographical expansion of an Old World virus into the New World. Analysis of phylogenies of field isolates of rabies virus of the family Rhabdoviridae sampled from different animals across Europe led to the recognition that interspecies virus expansion occurs faster when compared to geographical expansion.",

            "text": "Phylogenies can also reveal information about the relative strength of the virus\u2013host association over time. In some virus families (e.g., the Coronaviridae) host-jumping events may be relatively frequent in establishing new species, including the emergence of at least three human viruses, dead-end SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and successfully circulating human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). At the other end of the spectrum one finds the family Herpesviridae. Extensive phylogenetic analysis of herpesviruses and their hosts showed a remarkable congruency of topologies of trees indicating that this virus family may have emerged some 400 million years ago and that herpesviruses largely cospeciate with their hosts. Moreover, through phylogenetic analysis one can show that most viruses, and in particular RNA viruses, evolve at rates that are orders of magnitude faster than those of cellular organisms. For instance, even the most conserved enzymes encoded by nidoviruses, that comprise just four RNA virus families, accumulated more than twice as many substitutions during evolution than their counterparts across the ToL, as estimated through branch lengths of the respective phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1). Taking into account that the MRCA of all cellular organisms predates that of nidoviruses, this reveals that most residues of viral proteins changed repeatedly and more frequently than cellular protein residues during long-term evolution. In fact, this high evolutionary rate seems to be a prerequisite for RNA viruses to stay fit in the ever-changing environment considering their tiny genomes that would otherwise not be able to produce enough genetic variation.",

For viruses united in high-rank taxa above the genus level, phylogenetic clustering for most conserved replicative genes is commonly observed and used in the decision making process. For instance, human hepatitis E virus, originally classified as a calicivirus using largely virion properties, was eventually expelled from the family due to poor fit of genome characteristics, including results of phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic considerations also played an important role in establishing new families, for example, the Marnaviridae and Dicistroviridae. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis has been of relatively little use in the taxonomy of large DNA phages which has been developed in such a way that existing families may unite phages with different gene layouts and phylogenies. The relationship between phylogeny and taxonomy is evolving and efforts were made in extracting taxa structure from monophyletic clusters in trees using analysis of pairwise evolutionary distances. In future one might hope for important advancements of virus taxonomy that improve cross-family consistency in relation to phylogeny.",
