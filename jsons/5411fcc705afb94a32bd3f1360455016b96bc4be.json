Indeed, the processing of big and heterogeneous data collected by biomedical sensors along with the need of patients' classification and disease diagnosis become major challenges for several health-based sensing applications. Thus, the combination between remote sensing devices and the big data technologies have been proven as an efficient and low cost solution for healthcare applications. In this paper, we propose a robust big data analytics platform for real time patient monitoring and decision making to help both hospital and medical staff. The proposed platform relies on big data technologies and data analysis techniques and consists of four layers: real time patient monitoring, real time decision and data storage, patient classification and disease diagnosis, and data retrieval and visualization. To evaluate the performance of our platform, we implemented our platform based on the Hadoop ecosystem and we applied the proposed algorithms over real health data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our platform in terms of efficiently performing patient classification and disease diagnosis in healthcare applications.",

In addition, wars, pollution, food-related illness, and human-animal relationships cause the emergence and propagation of new types of diseases and viruses. Subsequently, with the emergence of an unknown disease, the governments face two major challenges: first, medical centers require more and more qualified staff in order to periodically monitor each patient and quickly act when an emergency state is detected. Second, the correct diagnosis of the patient's state and the progress of his situation are critical for medical staff. Recently, the \"Coronavirus\" propagated in China has threatened millions of people and the government was obliged to quickly build hospitals and increase the number of medical workers. Furthermore, integrating new technologies in healthcare has became an essential task in order to make hospitals more efficient in terms of monitoring and analyzing patient data, thus enhancing medical processes.",

This type of data has three characteristics: (1) massive data collection; (2) high speed generation; and (3) heterogeneous nature. Unfortunately, the relational database management systems and the traditional data storage technologies cannot handle such type and amount of data. \u2022 Rapid emergency detection: Usually, a normal health range is defined for each vital sign. Records outside this range lead to an abnormal situation which should be quickly detected and reported to the medical staff in order to take suitable actions. Hence, rapid emergency detection is a crucial event that can be a threat to patient safety or even life. \u2022 Disease diagnosis and patients' classification: In health applications, several diseases may generate similar symptoms. Hence, disease diagnosis is susceptible to human error which may provoke disabilities or death. Therefore, developing new techniques and algorithms in order to study, on the one hand, the correlation between symptoms and, on the other hand, classify patients according to their situations can help in making the right decision.",

The authors of [6] proposed the Priority-based Compressed Data Aggregation (PCDA) technique to reduce the amount of heath data transmitted. PCDA uses a compressed sensing approach followed by a cryptographic hash algorithm to save information accuracy before sending data for any diagnosis. The authors of [7] proposed a data reduction technique dedicated to wireless seizure systems. In addition to local compressive sensing, the proposed technique selects a set of features, specifically those with nonlinear autocorrelation, to reduce the seizure signals sent to the data server. In [8] , a cloud-based connected healthcare system, called BigReduce, is proposed. The objective of BigReduce is to minimize the data processing cost at the base station according to two schemes applied locally at the IoT sensors: reduction and decision schemes. Finally, the authors of [9] proposed a fault tolerance and data recovery algorithm in order to ensure the integrity of heath information and save the network energy. The proposed algorithm works in a distributed manner and it maintains a set of active nodes where each one copies its data to its neighbors according to several assumptions.",

The authors of [13] proposed a storage and processing architecture based on MapReduce and HBase, respectively. First, data generated by health sensors are inserted into HBase using a mass insertion script, and then a data analysis algorithm is proposed in order to retrieve valuable data and help in predicting disease. In [14] , the authors proposed a Hadoop-based framework in order to secure the transmitted data from biosensors to the server. The proposed framework relies on three main pillars: The Hadoop clusters for storing, backing up, and recovering data; a digital signature method, called ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), which is implemented in Sunspot nodes in order to secure communication; and the Sqoop tool, which is used to import and export data between Mysql and Hadoop HDFS. In [15] , a modern platform for healthcare information systems consisting of three layers is proposed. The first layer is composed of various data health sources such as sensors, clinical report, medication, etc. The second layer aims to process and store data and it uses various Hadoop tools including Sqoop, HDFS, HBase, MapReduce. and Hive. The last layer is responsible for applying business intelligence (BI) solutions over the stored data and it uses SpagoBI tools as an open source BI suite. Lastly, the authors of [16] proposed a correlation-based outlier detection platform, relying on Hadoop, to handle streaming of data generated in health applications. The objective of the platform is to search statistical relationships among biosensors, and then, in a later step, to predict contextual anomalies using an aggregated outlier checker.",

In [19] , a framework for stress detection and evaluation is proposed. The framework works by detecting first stress signals according to skin conductance parameter, and then the stress level is evaluated through fuzzy inference system based on patient vital signs, particularly heart rate, respiration rate, and average blood pressure. In a later work [20] , the authors proposed a data management framework for data collection and decision making in sensing-based healthcare. The framework relies on three algorithms: first, an emergency detection algorithm aims to send critical records directly to the coordinator; second, an adaptive sampling rate algorithm based on ANOVA (ANalysis of Variance) and Fisher test allows each sensor to adapt its sampling to the variation of patient situation; and third, a data fusion and decision making model is proposed to the coordinator based on decision matrix and fuzzy set theory. Despite its great advantages for patient monitoring and assessment, the proposed framework suffers from several disadvantages: (1) sensors only send critical records to the coordinator, thus medical staff cannot avoid patients entering dangerous situations before this happens; (2) in case of low critical patients, none of the data would be archived in the hospital, thus revising patient archives to check patient progress from doctors is not possible; and (3) integrating new data technologies, such as Hadoop, in order to handle big data collected by biosensors is not considered in the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed platform is still the only complete system that integrates both data analytics and Hadoop ecosystems. In addition, it consists of a sequence of layers aiming to tackle other problems related to patient classification and disease diagnosis. Finally, it combines several approaches such as machine learning, data mining, clustering, classification, etc.",

On the other hand, the parallel computing ensures a rapid data processing and analysis, especially when the volume of data becomes huge. Furthermore, the architecture of our platform consists of four layers, which allow an entire data analysis process for patients in hospitals, starting from patient data collection and ending with patients' classification and decision making. Subsequently, each layer performs batch and/or real-time processing. In batch mode, data are first stored in cluster nodes and then processed, while, in real-time mode, data are processed upon collection and before storing. These two processing modes provide a high efficiency in terms of applying any desired techniques (machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, etc.) over the collected data.

Hence, a set of record scores t S p V = [s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s T ] is calculated for t R p V . In Figure 2 , we show one of the most used EWS guides that is developed in UK and distributed around all the world, called National EWS (NEWS) [30] . Once the score set at each period is calculated, we propose to directly analyze the collected records and alert, ideally using phone device, the medical staff by the appropriate response. In our platform, we are interested in the clinical responses guide proposed in [30] as one of the most used guides around the world. In this guide, the coordinator calculates the aggregated score of records received at each period and then sends the corresponding response to the medical staff according to Figure 3 . For instance, if the score set calculated during a period is t S p V = [0, 2, 1, 2], then the aggregated score equals 5 (i.e., 0 + 2 + 1 + 2) and the coordinator sends an alert to medical staff informing that the frequency of patient monitoring should be increased to at least once per hour. Algorithm 1 describes the emergency detection and clinical response process, which is applied at the coordinator level. The algorithm takes as input the vector of records collected by all biosensors during a period time t. Then, it calculates the score for each record followed by the aggregate score (Lines 2-5). Finally, the coordinator sends an alert to the medical team indicating the clinical response that should be taken according to the situation of the patient (Lines 6 and 7).

Then, we created a four-node Hadoop cluster on four virtual machines with Ubuntu 18.04 as an operating system. In addition, a virtual machine was configured to act as the master node and the three other machines were configured to act as slave nodes. We installed all layer tools (ingestion, processing, and visualization) on the master node while the slave nodes were responsible for storing patient data. On the other hand, we used real health data collected from MultipleIntelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) database of PhysioNet [32] . MIMIC contains data for about 72 patients where records about vital signs include Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Respiration Rate (RR), and Oxygen Saturation (OS). Every second, the biosensor collects new reading for each vital sign, and then it sends toward the Hadoop cluster for processing and archiving purposes. In our simulation, we used a file that includes a log of about 100,000 readings for each patient. To make our simulation more realistic, patient records are stored separately in a file in the main directory of the master node. Then, we created Java and Python scripts that allow reading data for each patient while applying one of the proposed algorithms.

Figure 5 shows the distribution of patients over clusters after applying SKmeans algorithm when varying K from 2 to 6. We can notice several observations according to the obtained results: First, the patients are not equally distributed into clusters, which confirms the behavior of SKmeans of classifying patients based on their stability level and not in an equal way. Second, clusters approximately have the same number of patients regardless of the monitored vital sign (Figure 5a-d) . This confirms the existence of a correlation between the variation of vital signs of the same patient. Third, we obtain similar patients' classification when applying SKmeans on one vital sign (Figure 5a -d) and all vital signs (Figure 5e ). Fourth, we notice that the number of clusters converges to 5 with RR and OS biosensors. According to Figure 5 , Figure 6 shows a distribution map for the patient IDs classification over the clusters after applying SKmeans. The objective of this figure is to verify if patients with similar stability are always assigned to the same cluster for various vital signs or not. The number of clusters is fixed to 4. As expected, the obtained results show a significant correlation between vital signs where patients with same records' variation are grouped together. Therefore, we consider SKmeans as an efficient clustering algorithm for sensing-based healthcare application in terms of classifying patients according to their stability level and their situation progress.

Indeed, this factor becomes important to study in sensing-based healthcare since it affects the latency of decision making which is a critical factor in the study of emergency situations. The iteration number is mostly related to initial centroids which are randomly selected in both SKmeans and Kmeans. The obtained results show that SKmeans outperforms Kmeans in terms of minimizing the number of iterations with all vital sign conditions. Subsequently, the number of iterations in SKmeans varies from 2, in the worst case, to 9, in the best case, and from 8 to 14 using Kmeans. Therefore, SKmeans ensures a fast computation process to the medical staff. Figure 8 shows the processing speed, or the execution time, required to apply SKmeans and Kmeans algorithms for the various vital signs. Mostly, the processing speed is an indicator to the robustness of any system. In our platform, the processing speed is highly dependent on the iteration numbers shown in Figure 7 ; the greater is the iteration number, the longer is the processing time required and the lower is the robustness. Since SKmeans algorithm highly reduces the number of iterations, it simultaneously reduces the execution time compared to the traditional Kmeans. Subsequently, SKmeans can optimize the processing time speed up to three times compared to Kmeans. ",

Indeed, these rules allow finding correlations between vital signs and thus help the medical staff to understand the disease behavior.
