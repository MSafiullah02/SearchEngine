RSV infects nearly all children in the first two years of life [2] and is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in this population [3]. As a result, RSV infection is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the Western world [4]. To date, limited treatments exist for severe RSV infection and no safe effective RSV vaccine has been developed. Indeed, current prophylactic treatment is limited to the monthly administration of humanized mouse anti-RSV antibody preparations (Synagis) that reduce the incidence of severe disease by \u223c50% [5], [6]. However, due to expense, these preparations are only administered to infants at high risk for severe RSV infection [7].",

Furthermore, grafting of mPEG to T cells prevents allorecognition and T cell activation demonstrating that mPEG grafting inhibits receptor\u2013ligand interaction of cell surface proteins [11], [12]. Analogous to these allogenic receptor\u2013ligand interactions, we have shown that direct mPEG-modification of simian virus 40 (SV40) prevents host cell infection [13]. Furthermore, mPEG-modification of host cell surface proteins protected cells from viral challenge with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse adenovirus (MAV), rat coronavirus (RCV), and SV40 [13]. Thus, we sought to evaluate mPEG grafting directly to either RSV or its host cell as the initial phase in developing a prophylactic anti-RSV nasal spray [13], [14], [15].",

As noted, both SCmPEG and SVAmPEG resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the number of syncytia. However, relative to Cm- and SCmPEG, SVAmPEG resulted in significantly greater inhibition of RSV infection at all grafting concentrations (p < 0.026) with the exception of 15 mm where all linker chemistries yielded nearly complete protection.

Comparing the two polymer lengths containing the SC linker chemistry, the 2 kDa mPEG was superior to the 5 kDa chain at grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 12.5 mm (p\n < 0.012). Importantly, at both 7.5, 12.5 and 15 mm grafting concentrations, the 2 kDa SCmPEG virtually abolished RSV infection while the 5 kDa SCmPEG did not. The SVA-linker chemistry provided superior protection at the lower grafting concentrations at all three molecular weights (2, 5, and 20 kDa; Fig. 1B). While some statistical advantage (p\n < 0.025) was seen with the 2 and 5 kDa polymers over the 20 kDa SVAmPEG at the 5 mm grafting concentration, this was not thought to be of biologic significance.

Virus MOI ranging from 0.5 to 0.01 were modified with 2 or 20 kDa SVAmPEG for HeLa cell challenge (Fig. 2\n). As shown, at the very high MOI of 0.5, low grafting concentrations of SVAmPEG (2 mm) of either the 2 or 20 kDa polymers were ineffective at preventing viral invasion. However, as grafting concentration increased (\u22655 mm) a dose-dependent decrease in viral infection was noted with a near complete abrogation of infection at \u226512.5 mm. Interestingly, at the 7.5 mm grafting concentration at an MOI of 0.5, the 2 kDa mPEG polymer was significantly (p\n < 0.006) more effective at preventing viral infection than the 20 kDa chain (Fig. 2A). As the MOI decreased, the relative dose-dependent efficacy of mPEG grafting increased due to a greater polymer to virus ratio (i.e., more chains per viral particle). An interesting finding was that, as a general trend, RSV modification with short chain polymers (2 kDa) provided improved anti-viral efficacy over long (20 kDa) chain polymers, especially at lower grafting concentrations (e.g., MOI 0.05 and 0.01 at 2 mm grafting concentration; p\n < 0.007). At higher RSV grafting concentrations (\u226512.5 mm), both polymer lengths yielded nearly complete protection against viral infection at all MOI.

However, similar to our findings, modification of adenovirus with high levels (or for prolonged periods) with CmPEG or succinimidyl propionate mPEG (SPAmPEG) dramatically decreased host cell infection [23], [24]. Further studies indicated that the decrease in infection observed with CmPEG resulted from the cross-linking of several virions by bifunctional CmPEG molecules [24]. However, in our TEM studies with SVAmPEG, little or no virus aggregates were observed. Additional studies with mPEG-modified adenovirus have also shown that modification of the virus with treysl mPEG (TmPEG) did not dramatically blunt infection both in vitro and in vivo [24], [25], [26]. These findings are not surprising as TmPEG grafted at a lower density relative to CmPEG and SCmPEG [24], and previous studies in our laboratory have shown that TmPEG is relatively poor at camouflaging cell surface epitopes on white blood cells [12]. Thus, it appears that with the TmPEG linker chemistry, high levels of protein modification are not readily achieved.

Again, as noted in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, for both SCmPEG and SVAmPEG, shorter polymers showed a trend towards enhanced protection over the long chain polymers at lower grafting concentrations; i.e., when the virus particle to polymer ratio is low. At these low virus:mPEG ratios the improved efficacy of the 2 kDa polymer may be partially due to the distribution of virus specific proteins within the viral envelope. On the RSV virion the G (attachment) and F (fusion) proteins form glycoprotein spikes that are 6\u201310 nm apart and extent 11\u201320 nm from the virion surface [20]. Previous studies on mPEG polymers grafted to artificial surfaces have shown that 2 kDa mPEG extends \u223c6 nm from the surface [27], while 20 kDa mPEG extends \u223c50 nm from the surface (estimated length based on [27]). As mPEG is a highly flexible molecule, each grafted mPEG chain inhibits large molecules or particles (i.e. other mPEG chain, antibodies, cells) from interacting with the cell surface within the radius of the polymer. Thus given the distance between glycoprotein spikes on the RSV virion, grafting of 2 kDa mPEG will likely result in the direct modification of a greater number of glycoprotein spikes. Grafting of 20 kDa mPEG will likely result in fewer spikes being modified as the initially bound mPEG will exclude other polymer chains from grafting to spikes in close proximity. At higher grafting concentrations, the self-exclusion effect of grafted mPEG is partially overcome resulting in high levels of surface modification. This effect is further enhanced with the SVAmPEG due to its longer half-life.",

However, the ability to produce an anti-viral barrier by the direct PEGylation of the target cells (e.g., nasal epithelial cell) of the virus would be of significant clinical utility. As noted in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, direct grafting of the 20 kDa mPEG polymer to mammalian cells resulted in a potent anti-RSV barrier. Indeed, at higher grafting concentrations (\u22657.5 mm) very significant protection was observed at all MOI. However, polymer size was a crucial determinant of this anti-viral effect. In contrast to direct modification of RSV, the 2 kDa polymer demonstrated no efficacy when modifying target cells. These findings were somewhat surprising as previous studies with mPEG-modified host cells in other viruses models demonstrated some efficacy with smaller polymers although large polymers were clearly superior [13]. Furthermore, our previous studies on surface charge camouflage and antigenic masking of cell surface epitopes also showed that both short and long chain polymers conferred protection, although large polymers were similarly more effective [9], [12].",

Because of the dramatic difference in host cell protection seen between the 2 and 20 kDa mPEG polymers, our findings may provide some insight as to the size of the RSV receptor. When 2 kDa mPEG is grafted to the cell surface it will produce an mPEG zone of exclusion that extends approximately 6 nm above the surface [27]. In contrast, 20 kDa mPEG will project \u223c50 nm from the surface (theoretical estimate based on [27]), therefore, a much deeper mPEG zone of exclusion is created. Given the differing efficacies of the two polymer lengths, it is likely that the RSV receptor extends more than 6 nm above the cell surface, but does not extend past 50 nm. Thus, the RSV receptor would be effectively hidden by the 20 kDa polymer, but remain unprotected by the 2 kDa polymer.",

Interestingly, while 2\u201320 kDa polymers demonstrated efficacy when modifying the RSV particle itself, only long chain polymers conferred protection against RSV when derivatizing the target cells. This polymer size effect was not due to a size difference between RSV (150\u2013300 nm) and HeLa cells (11\u201324 \u03bcm in diameter), but potentially reflects the size of the currently unknown RSV receptor as short chain polymers were effective against other viruses [20], [28]. Hence, our findings suggest that activated mPEG-based anti-viral therapies must take into consideration both the known and unknown interactions between the virus and host cell. This may be most readily accomplished using long chain polymers only, or by using a combination of long and short chain polymer species. Thus, this study further supports the potential clinical utility of mPEG grafting to host cells as a new broad spectrum, anti-viral prophylactic therapy.",
