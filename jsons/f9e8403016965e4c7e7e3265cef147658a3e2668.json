G and F proteins are responsible for the initial phases of viral infection through attachment with the infecting cell. 26 The cell fusion is mediated by F, G, and SH proteins and the latter is believed to change membrane permeability. 27 Based on the structural features of the matrix protein (M) and ribonucleoprotein (RNP), there are three morphological forms (a, b, and c) of RSV particles (\u25baFig. 2). 28 Transmission of RSV occurs mainly via the nose through infected aerosols. RSV remains infectious on many environmental surfaces suggesting that transmission can occur through contact with hands or inanimate surfaces contaminated with infected nasal secretions. 29 Most of the RSV-associated ARTI are community-acquired, but there have also been reports of hospital-acquired RSV infections. 8, 30 The likelihood of hospital-acquired RSV infection increases with the duration of hospital stay and gaps in the infections control practices. 31 Based on a previous study, RSV detection in children at the time of admission was 39%, which increased to 62% during the hospital stay. 32 RSV alters host cells by initially infecting the epithelial lining of the respiratory airway and nasal passage. The virus influences the expression of genes controlling protein metabolism, inflammation, cell growth, proliferation, nucleic acid regulation, and synthesis. 33 RSV infection causes pneumonia through damaging the respiratory epithelium and bronchociliary apparatus; this results in the collection of fluid in bronchioles and alveoli causing obstruction and collapse of the affected area of the lung. Replication of RSV starts from nasopharynx primarily in the superficial layer of the respiratory epithelium and the virus then descends from the nasopharynx to lower respiratory tract via the respiratory epithelium or inhalation of secretions. 34 RSV-associated bronchiolitis is the most important cause of admission to the hospital during the first year of infancy. 8 Around 50 and 25% hospitalizations of infants are due to RSVassociated bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 34 RSV is responsible for precipitating recurrent wheezes and asthma in susceptible children. 35 Recurrent RSV infections also cause residual parenchymal or airway damage leading to minor abnormalities in lung function in the longer term. The mechanisms involved in RSV-associated recurrent wheeze and asthma are not clear, and whether RSV is directly responsible for asthma or infects children with preexisting broncho-obstructive disease remains unresolved. 36 Recent studies suggest that RSV causes asthma in some infants, but is also capable of attacking infants with a predisposition for wheezing. 36,37 Hospitalized infants aged < 1 year with RSV-associated bronchitis have a tendency to develop asthma and recurrent wheeze for a few years. 38 Here, we review the impact of RSV-associated ARTI on children in Asia including epidemiology, laboratory diagnosis, therapies, and future research priorities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 44, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 134, "end": 136, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 230, "end": 232, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 328, "end": 330, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 465, "end": 467, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 780, "end": 782, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1067, "text": "28", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1331, "text": "29", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1460, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1463, "text": "30", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1746, "text": "32", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2506, "text": "34", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2627, "end": 2628, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2823, "end": 2825, "text": "35", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3189, "end": 3191, "text": "36", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3476, "end": 3478, "text": "38", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Since the discovery of RSV 61 years ago, the virus has been identified as a major cause of ARTI in infants and the single most common cause of childhood hospitalization. 39 During the past 31 years, RSV has been identified as the cause of severe LRTI in infants and children in developing countries. 39 RSV-associated morbidity and mortality appear to be high in infants < 3 months and children with known risk factors compared with other viral LRTI. Known risk factors for acquiring RSV-associated LRTI include prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, down syndrome, compromised immunity, crowded living conditions, and exposure to tobacco or industrial smoke. 9,40 Moreover, RSV-associated ARTI appears to be common in boys than girls; 41 the reason for the male preponderance is believed to be due to immunomodulatory effects of the sex hormones during the early stages of life. 42 Severe RSV-associated respiratory disease has also been recognized as a significant health issue in adult populations, and epidemiological data suggest that the impact of RSV in adults is largely similar to nonpandemic influenza. ARTI due to RSV have been reported in the institutionalized elderly, the immunocompromised, and adults with cardiopulmonary diseases. 43 The Impact of RSV on Global Child Health Globally, RSV is commonly associated with childhood ALRI and related hospital admissions, which results with a substantial burden to the health care systems and economy. Approximately 45% of the hospitalizations and deaths are caused by RSV-associated ARTI in infants < 6 months. In 2015, 33.1 million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children less than 5 years, with at least 3.2 million hospitalizations and 59,600 in-hospital deaths. 44 Moreover, RSV-associated ALRI caused 1.4 million hospitalizations with 27,300 in-hospital deaths in infants < 6 months. 44 Alaskan native infants have the highest rates of RSV hospitalizations in the world. 42 RSV-associated hospitalization rates for Alaskan native infants, in the rural Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) region of Alaska were five times higher than that for the overall United States infant population. 45 From 1993 to 2004 is considered to be the period when the worst RSV outbreaks occurred in the YKD region, and RSV-associated hospitalization rates rose to 38 to 248 per 1,000 during that period. Infants from indigenous Canadian populations, Germany, the United States, New Zealand, and Europe also have high hospitalization rates with RSVassociated ARTI. 46 The Impact of RSV on Child Health in Asia Based on studies conducted in Asia, the most common cause of LRTI in children is RSV (\u25baTable 2). In Hong Kong, RSV-associated hospitalization has been described in children < 5 years. 64 In Japan, RSV-associated LRTI occurred in 31.4% of a sample of 535 children aged < 3 years. 47 In Lanzhou, China, RSV was detected in 40.71% of the children with ARTI. 50 In another study, RSV accounted for 25.0% of the LRTI cases in Harbin, China. 51 In Hong Kong, RSV has been detected in young infants with chronic lung disease, neurodevelopmental conditions, and congenital heart disease; these risk factors significantly increased the risk of RSV infection. 65 Information on the impact of RSV in childhood ARTI in South East Asian countries is scanty. In Malaysia, RSV is the most common respiratory virus identified in children 6 months, accounting for 81.3% of the LRTI cases. 53 Data from Lombok, Indonesia, suggest that 16% of LRTI deaths are caused by RSV. 66 In Vietnam, RSV, influenza A, and rhinoviruses contribute to pneumonia along with multiple viral and coinfections with bacteria. 67 In Bhaktapur, Nepal, RSV infections were detected in 15.1% of the study sample, 58 and in India RSV accounted for 57% of ARTI cases. 64 In Bangladesh, RSV has been identified as the predominant (81%) viral pathogen causing pneumonia in children in rural areas. 60 In urban areas of Bangladesh, the overall incidence of RSVassociated pneumonia is 40/100 child years. 61 In temperate regions of Asia RSV causes outbreaks mostly during the fall or winter; in tropical regions of Asia RSV outbreaks usually peak in hot or rainy seasons, but can occur at any time of the year with genotype shifting. 68 Based on the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in China, RSV has been mostly detected in infants year around with peaks from autumn to winter. 49 In contrast to these findings reported from the mainland China, 58 RSV seasonality has not been noted in winter in Hong Kong. 65 In Japan, cocirculation of different RSV genotypes has been observed every year with shifts in genotypes within a season. 48 In Nepal, the largest peaks of pneumonia occur during RSV peak seasons in rainy and winter periods from July to April. 58, 69 In India, RSV outbreaks occur in the rainy season from August to November. 59 The Impact of RSV on Childhood ARTI in Sri Lanka", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 172, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 300, "end": 302, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 947, "end": 949, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1316, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1822, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1945, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2032, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2240, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2598, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2825, "end": 2827, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2920, "end": 2922, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2996, "end": 2998, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3077, "end": 3079, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3291, "end": 3293, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3513, "end": 3515, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3596, "end": 3598, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3728, "end": 3730, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3811, "end": 3813, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3864, "end": 3866, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3992, "end": 3994, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 4097, "end": 4099, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 4326, "end": 4328, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 4493, "end": 4495, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4622, "end": 4624, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 4747, "end": 4749, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4869, "end": 4872, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4873, "end": 4875, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 4951, "end": 4953, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RSV-Associated Disease Burden"}, {"text": "Childhood hospitalization due to RSV-associated ARTI is common in Sri Lanka. 70 RSV is recognized as the most common cause of viral ARTI among children in Sri Lanka, as in many other countries.

RSV-associated respiratory disease epidemics tend to occur in clusters during a particular season. Although the occurrence of RSV outbreaks varies among continents, the general pattern is that they start in coastal areas and spread to inland areas. 39 In countries experiencing tropical and semitropical climates and located far from the equator, RSV outbreaks occur in cool dry and cool wet seasons. In regions closer to the equator, RSV outbreaks occur throughout the year with periods of peak activity. 39 RSV outbreaks have been reported year around with a slight increase in the rainy seasons in equatorial islands like Singapore, Fiji, Taiwan, and Hawaii. 40 In countries north of the equator like India, outbreaks have been reported predominantly during the rainy season. 40 RSV peaks have been reported in the winter months in most of the European countries although the infections remain relatively consistent throughout the year. 40 Although there are predictions made on RSV seasonality patterns, the predictions are not reviewed systematically at a global level, in parallel with surveillance data for many other respiratory viruses like influenza in the last decade.
