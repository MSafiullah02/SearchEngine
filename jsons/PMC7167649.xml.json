Among these viruses, NDV is a member of the Avulavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family and is prevalent worldwide and infects almost all avian species. In fact, highly contagious respiratory, enteric, and neurological diseases in chickens are often caused by a variety of infectious NDV strains 1, 2. AIV is an enveloped virus with a segmented, single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA genome belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family and can cause clinical diseases in a wide range of mammalian and avian species. Low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H9 circulates worldwide in multiple avian species thereby posing a potential threat to not only the poultry industry, but also to public health 3, 4. IBV is a gammacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales\n5, and primarily replicates in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and causes lower respiratory tract infections in chickens (Gallus domesticus). In addition, emerging IBV isolates that vary in their replicative abilities in nonrespiratory tissues have been associated with proventriculus and kidney lesions 6, 7.",

To date, various proteomic strategies have been applied to elucidate protein dynamics during influenza infections, such as differential expression of brain proteins in response to the neurovirulent AIV H5N1 infection 8, host responses of murine lung tissues infected with AIV H5N1 9, and cellular protein changes in H1N1\u2010infected human lung A549 cells 10; while cellular responses to AIV H9N2 subtype infections has only been reported by Liu et al. in human cells 11. For IBV, proteomic changes have been reported in the cytoplasm, nuclei, and nucleoli in mammalian Vero cells and nucleolar proteomes in avian cells (DF\u20101) infected with IBV (Beaudette strain) 12, 13. We previously reported alterations in the proteome of tracheal and kidney cells during IBV strain H120 infection in vitro, and IBV strain ck/CH/LDL/97I and its attenuated strain ck/CH/LDL/97I P115 infection in vivo 14, 15. However, alterations of cellular protein expression profiles, whether in NDV\u2010infected cell lines or tissues, and the differences in induced protein expression changes between different avian respiratory viruses (IBV, NDV, and AIV H9) have not yet been reported.",

The avian respiratory viruses, including IBV, NDV and AIV H9, can infect tracheal epithelial cells and induce damage to tracheal epithelium resulting in respiratory disease. However, the severity and outcome of the clinical illness caused by these different viruses are different 16, 17, 18. To better understand the molecular basis of pathogenesis and specific virus\u2013host interactions, herein, we described the alterations of protein expression profiles in chicken tracheal tissues caused by IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I and H120, NDV La Sota, and AIV H9 infection by using 2D\u2010DIGE analyses. A series of differentially expressed proteins associated with viral life cycle and host response to IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 infections were identified. The present proteome results using the same virus of different strains (IBV virulent ck/CH/LDL/97I and H120 vaccine) and different viruses (IBV, NDV and AIV H9) might provide more significant information on specific aspects of molecular pathogenesis and virus\u2013host interactions of these different viruses. Furthermore, these findings might also provide useful clues for the development of novel prevention or therapeutics strategies against these viruses.",

The virus stock for this study was produced by inoculating the virus into embryonated specific pathogen\u2010free (SPF) chicken eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 72 h postinoculation. The allantoic fluid was clarified by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and filtered with a Teflon membrane and the presence of IBV was confirmed by negative contrast electron microscopy (JEM\u20101200, EX; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and RT\u2010PCR as previously described 21. NDV and subtype H9 AIV viral particles in the allantoic fluids of inoculated eggs were confirmed using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) analysis with specific antibodies, respectively 22.

This difference may indicate that pathogenic IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I and AIV H9 trigger more severe inflammatory responses and immune suppression than IBV H120 and NDV La Sota vaccine strains that associate with their different pathogenetic processes. In addition, PPIA can facilitate replication of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV\u20101) 34 and coronaviruses including IBV 35.

In our previous work, the abundance of ANXA2 was only increased following attenuated IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P115 infection, no significantly abundance changes of ANXA2 were observed during virulent IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I P5 infection, suggesting that the ANXA2 may be specific host response to avirulent IBV strains (ck/CH/LDL/97I P115 and H120). The function of ANXA2 in life cycle of NDV needs further investigation.",

Phosphorylated HSPB1 has been shown to participate in the replication of adenovirus 60, HCV 61, and herpes simplex virus type 1 62. In this study, the upregulation of phosphorylated HSPB1 during IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 infections was confirmed by Western bolt (Fig. 3). It was reported that RSV\u2010induced phosphorylation of HSPB1 in human bronchial epithelial cells ultimately results in epithelial membrane permeability 63. Avian respiratory viruses infections can result in tracheal epithelium lesion, but the severity and persistence of the lesions differed among different viruses 16, 17, 18. Therefore, phosphorylated HSPB1 that mainly upregulated in IBV H120 and NDV La Sota infected groups at 7 dpi and in IBV ck/CH/LDL/97I and AIV H9 infected groups at 12 dpi may be responsible for the tracheal epithelium lesions at different stages of avian respiratory viruses infections. Further studies should focus on the exact roles of phosphorylated HSPB1 in the replication and pathogenesis of IBV, NDV, and AIV H9.",

In this study, antioxidant stress proteins including PRDX1, 3, 4, 6; GST; and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (Table 2 and Supporting Information Table 2), were universally altered in all viruses\u2010infected groups. Most of altered proteins were upregulated, which may be related to relief of cellular oxidative stress induced by IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 infections. Moreover, more extensive changes were observed in AIV H9 infected group, suggesting that AIV H9 may activate more intense oxidative stress. Among these antioxidant stress proteins, PRDX1 and PRDX4 have been reported to protect RSV\u2010induced oxidative damage to the nuclear cytoskeletal proteins in epithelial cells 65, while downregulation of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GST, and PRDX) induced by RSV contributes to RSV pathogenesis 66. In addition, PRDX1 can activate secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by interacting with TLR4 67. PRDX4 plays critical protective roles in inflammatory diseases 38. Similarly, we considered that the upregulation of PRDX1 and PRDX4 during IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 infections may activate host antiviral immunity to eliminate viral infection and provide protective cellular mechanisms to reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory damage. However, the potential roles of downregulated oxidative stress\u2010associated proteins in the pathogenesis of IBV, NDV, and AIV needed to be investigated further.",

The comparative analysis of changes in tracheal protein profile induced by IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 in vivo provides insight into mechanisms of global host response to different avian respiratory virus infections. However, the sites of IBV, NDV, and AIV infection are actually not completely consistent, IBV replicates in the epithelium of lower respiratory tract of chicken 68, NDV and AIV H9 subtypes induce lesions in the upper respiratory tract 18, 69. The roles of different sites of respiratory tract in this study had not been effectively measured. Moreover, infections of IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 subtype viruses can elicit inflammatory responses characterized by recruitment of myeloid or lymphoid cells. Consequently, the cellular types of tracheal tissues harvested from mock and virus\u2010infected chickens for proteomics analysis may differ due to immune cell infiltration. As a result, the changes revealed by proteomic analysis of some proteins, such as LGALS1, PPIA, and PRDX1, that could also be expressed in immune cells in the course of viral infection may be caused or partly caused by cellular heterogeneity occurred during the inflammatory response to viral infection (including infiltration by innate and adaptive immune cells). This needed to be further investigated. In addition, though a number of differentially expressed proteins that have potential roles in revealing the common or specific aspects of viral pathogenesis and virus\u2013host interactions were identified, the precise roles of these proteins during viral infection had not proved in this study. Nevertheless, the similar and different protein expression profiles induced by different avian respiratory viruses after infection might be indicators of the essential response of infected target cells, provide insights into viral pathogenesis and host antiviral defense, and supply useful clues for the development of novel prevention or therapeutics strategies against these viruses.",
