This is in accordance with results suggested by the Bajaj et al. [39], who stated that the reliability of the QSAR model lies in its predictive ability even though the activity data are in the narrow range. Further, recent literature reveals that the QSAR have been applied to describe the relationship between narrow range of biological activity and physicochemical properties of the molecules [24], [40], [41], [42]. When biological activity data lies in the narrow range, the presence of minimum standard deviation of the biological activity justifies its use in QSAR studies [24], [25]. The minimum standard deviation (Table 2) observed in the antimicrobial activity data justifies its use in QSAR studies. Some of the other statistically important ot-QSAR models are given in Table 8\n.",

In these cases we have to develop one ot-QSAR for each target. However, very recently the interest has been increased in development of multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) models. In opposition to ot-QSAR, the mt-QSAR model is a single equation that considers the nature of molecular descriptors which are common and essential for describing the antibacterial and antifungal activity [43], [44], [45], [46], [47].",

This observation reveals the fact that presence of chloro substituent at ortho position increases the antibacterial and antifungal potential of the compounds. This fact is supported by the observations of Guven et al. [49].3.It can also be seen from the results of antibacterial and antifungal activity that the activity increases with increase in chain length of acid portion of synthesized compounds (1\u20134, 11\u201314). This is similar to one of our previous reports [23].4.Compounds 6 and 16 derived from cinnamic acid have shown better activity as compared to other synthesized compounds. This may be due to the presence of extended conjugation in cinnamic acid portion and aromatic nucleus of aldehydes, which may be involved in binding of synthesized compound with the target site. This fact is supported by one of our earlier studies [24].5.The presence of electron withdrawing group (NO2) in compounds 10 and 20 makes them highly active antibacterial and antifungal agents. The role of electron withdrawing group in increasing the antibacterial and antifungal activity is similar to the results of P. Sharma et al. [50]. The SAR results are summarized in Fig. 1\n.\n",

The antiviral evaluation depicted that compounds 9 and 19 were active against Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in HeLa cell cultures. To understand the relationship between physicochemical parameters and antibacterial and antifungal activity of substituted benzylidene hydrazide derivatives, QSAR investigation was performed by development of one-target and multi-target models. The multi-target model was found to be effective in describing the antimicrobial activity of substituted hydrazides in comparison to the one-target models. Further it indicated the importance of the topological parameters, second order molecular connectivity index (2\n\u03c7) and third order Kier's alpha shape index (\u03ba\u03b1\n3) in describing the antimicrobial activity of substituted hydrazides.",
