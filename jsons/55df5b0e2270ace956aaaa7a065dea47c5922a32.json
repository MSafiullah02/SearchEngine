Although cultures of 3-day-old ceils contained some senescent cells, the symptoms of cell aging were very conspicuous at 10 days and were most pronounced at 17 days. The amount of cytoplasm decreased as the number of lyric areas, myelin figures and vesicle bodies increased. Other noticeable subcellular changes observed were ultrastructural modifications of mitochondria, proplastids, amyloplasts, and nuclei. Such changes were associated with a general deterioration of the lipoprotein complex of the cell during its growth. A fibrous structure without an external membrane was observed and its reported for the first time for cells grown in suspension culture.",

Age-related changes in cellular systems often are not readily identifiable, although at the ultrastructural level sites in certain organelles (lysosomes, microbodies, cytoplasmic vacuoles, plasma membranes and other membrane systems) may reflect such changes.

Cell suspensions were cultured in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml autoclaved medium to which 10 ml of a 4-to 5-day-old suspension was added. They were placed on a rotary horizontal shaker at 100 cycles per minute at 26 ~ in the dark. Growth was monitored by changes in ovendry weight at 70 ~ At least 3 flasks were harvested per sampling time. Cells were filtered onto Miracloth, rinsed with water and dried. For studies with the electron microscope, cells were fixed at 3, 10, and 17 days after inoculation with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 1.5 hours, rinsed and suspended in 2.50/o agar in buffer, post fixed into 20/o OsO4 in the same buffer for 2 hours at room temperature, dehydrated with acetone and embedded in Spurt resin (S~ut~R 1969) . Thin sections were cut with glass knives on a Tessla ultramicrotome, mounted on uncoated 300 mesh copper grids, poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed with a JEM 7 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. At least 12 to 15 capsules were made from each sample and at least 200 micrographs were observed for each harvest time. No samples were taken for electron microscopy at 0 days because the cells had been transferred to fresh medium 5 days before the beginning of the experiments (0 days). Therefore, cells sampled at 0 days would be representative of 5-day-old cells. Presumably, the most actively dividing cells are those most likely to survive and divide for subsequent growth.",

At 3 days the diversity of cell types was limited and most resembled meristematic cells (Fig. 2 A) . They were rich in cytoplasm with a large and round (occasionally irregularly-shaped) nucleus that was generally centrally located. Most had a single large nucleolus with a compact inner structure. Some nucleoli were ring-shaped (in two dimensions) with fine granular fibrillar areas (Fig. 2 B) . At this stage some of the most numerous and prominent organelles were relatively undifferentiated proplastids (Fig. 3 A) . Many were similar in size and morphology to mitochondria, so it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between them. The plastids were oval or round with a finely granular stroma and surrounded by a double envelope that was typically more electron dense than that of the mitochondria. Osmiophilic droplets (plastoglobuli) were common. The granular stroma contained small vesicles or thin tubules and cisternae of low electron density that could be interpreted as At 10 days after inoculation, the cell types were more diverse than at 3 days. Most cells contained fewer and relatively larger vacuoles with relatively less cytoplasm and fewer organdies than at 3 days. These cells resembled storage parenchyma ceils of intact plants (Fig. 4 A) . Some cells were in incipient stages of senescence. The number of ribosomes in the cytoplasm appeared to have decreased. Polysomes were frequent and were not membrane bound but others were bound mainly to the ER. Nuclei were oval and nucleoli had distinct fibrillar and granular zones (Fig. 4 B) . This is in contrast to the more rounded, electron dense nucleoli of younger cells at 3 days.",

Amyloplasts increased in size in older cells and large starch grains occupied almost the entire amyloplast (Fig. 6 A) . In the more advarLce stages of senescence, plastid stroma was very much reduced and less dense than in young cells. Plastid envelopes were broken in some places. Also, the starch grains were dispersed in the cytoplasm in an unorganized manner. The plasma membrane had secondary vacuoles of variable sizes and shapes that often contained membranous configurations or fibrous materials. These structures appeared less frequently in young cells but were extremely abundant in old cells. Secondary vacuoles protruded into the primary vacuole but were delimited from the tonoplast by an intermembranous zone of variable width. In many cases secondary vacuoles were detached from the plasma membrane and formed a single membrane-bound compartment; usually possessing membranous inclusions. Many myelinic figures were present, with irregular and vesicular shapes (Fig. 5 B) . Most of the cell organelles were modified. The nucleus was usually present until the most advance stages of senescence and, in some cases, was normal. However, in many cells it was altered seriously. The perinuclear space increased and contained some osmiophilic material (Figs. 6 B and D) . Also, the nuclear envelope was limited by numerous small vesicles that were of electron dense material near the ER (Figs. 6 B and D) .

            "text": "Cells of varying ages are found in suspensions grown asynchronously. These cells range from those actively dividing to those totally degraded by the normal senescence process as the nutrients of the medium are depleted and its composition is changed. Proper sampling is a major problem when asynchronous cell suspensions are used. Sampling must be adequate to determine which anatomical features are most representative of individual cells at each particular age. This, of course, would be unnecessary in synchronous cultures. On the other hand, cell suspensions are uniquely adapted to studies of senescence because differentiation does not occur or sometimes can be controlled by chemical manipulation. Therefore, the aspects of senescence can be separated from those of differentiation. An important phenomenon of aging in rice cells was the reduction in quantity of cytoplasm relative to the cell size. Lytic areas within the cytoplasm, myelin figures, multivesicular bodies and residual bodies all occurred more frequently in older ceils than in younger cells. The appearance of myelin figures and other membranous arrays are evidence of intracellular digestion of lipoprotein complexes, with resultant accumulation of undigested residues. A greater mitochondrial population was not observed with age as reported LEE and CHASSON (1966) for potato tuber tissue. However, we observed modifications in mitochondrial inner structure (i.e., atypical cristae that were swollen or arranged in a circular pattern) similar to those in root tips of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (NEwcOMB, STEER, HEVLER, and WEROIN 1968) or Acer pseudoplatanus L. cells cultured in suspension (DAvEY and STREET 1971) . SUTTON-JoNES and STREET (1968) also described the circular pattern of cristae as a characteristic modification in older A. pseudoplatanus cells. These morphologic anomalies occurred simultaneously with the loss of structural organization and probably are associated with mitochondrial protein hydrolysis. Proplastids and amyloplasts had numerous modifications that might have resulted from inhibition of lamellae system differentiation and hydrolysis of their structural proteins. The synthesis of thylakoid structural proteins is under the control of chloroplast DNA so the inhibition of differentiation of the lamellae system in the senescent cells could have resulted from changes in the transcription of plastid DNA. The amount of ER and numbers of ribosomes attached to the ER increased with age. FOWKE and SETTERFIELD (1968) described the same phenomenon during aging of Jerusalem artichoke tuber slices and suggested that this was due to gene repression and establishment of an organized protein synthesizing complex. Microbodies were seldom observed in O. sativa although CRONSHAW (1964) , DAVEY and STREET (1971) , SUTTON-JoNEs and STREET (1968 ), and MATStXSHIMA (1971 b) described crystal-containing bodies corresponding in detail to microbodies in other cell cultures. FOWKE and SETTERFIELD (1968) indicated that the crystal containing bodies in Jerusalem artichoke tuber slices lost their crystalline core, and the amorphous bodies practically disappeared after 2,4-D was added as a growth factor. These bodies were thought to disappear during auxin-stimulated expansion. The O. sativa culture medium contained 2,4-D as a growth regulator which may account for the lack of microbodies or their presence only as amorphous bodies. The 2,4-D may have inhibited microbody differentiation or catalase accumulation. The elongated fibrous structures in O. sativa cells resembled the crystalline p-protein components previously described in sieve elements and companion cells by WER6IN and NEWCOMB (1970) and by PALEVITS and N~WCOMB (1971) . The appearance of fibrous proteinaceous structures and their association with ER and ribosomes suggested that such structures may be involved in protein synthesis that may be extremely active at 3 days when a substantial increase in cytoplasm occurs. These inclusions have no known role. They resemble structures that WILSON, ISRAEL, and STEWARD (1974) observed in carrot (Daucus carota L.) cultures. These workers indicated that the \"pinwheel\" and fibrous structures in their cultures were not virus particles, although they do resemble somewhat structures reported to be induced by viruses (MARTELH and Rt; sso 1977) or even virus particles themselves (CHRISTIE and EDWARDSON 1977) . We have no evidence to suggest the fibrous structures in O. sativa cell suspensions are viral inclusions.",

These structures have been called \"'lomasomes'\" (SuTTON-JONES and STREET 1968) , \"multivesicular bodies\" (HALPERIN and JENSEN 1967) or \"plasmalemmasomes\" (ROBARDS and KIDWAi 1969) . MARCl-IANT and ROB ARDS (1968) suggested that membranes external to the plasma membrane may be classified as either lomasomes or plasmalemmasomes, both of which they interpreted as having exocytotic functions. MAHLBERG, TURNER, WALKINSHAW, and VENKETESWARAN (1974) studied these structures in aging cultures of Euglena gracilis. Their results suggested that the diverse membranous contents may become integrated and thus no longer represent separate structures. They indicated that secondary vacuoles may detach from the plasma membrane to form a single membrane-bound compartment, usually possessing membranous inclusions. Endocytosis may complement reported exocytosis and contribute to a cycling process of membranes within cells. The vacuoles that appeared at incipient stages of senescence may form from the cytoplasm, with ribosome, ER profiles and Golgi bodies protruding into the vacuoles, followed by the start of the digestion process. Alternately, the smooth ER membrane may surround portions of the cytoplasm, followed by digestion or autolysis. This is representative of the processes in senescing cells found in cell suspensions of all ages. Senescence is accompanied by all of the different phenomena described. They apparently are part of the general biological process of deterioration of the cellular lipoprotein complex and characteristic for each species. In the growth and development of the cell, numerous metabolites, such as proteins, glycoproteins, amino acids and their breakdown products, nucleic acids and their breakdown products, lipids, and other substances, are released within the cytoplasm. Some of the metabolites are degraded by autolysis and recycled in the metabolic pool, but others may remain sequestered inside the cell and become toxic.",

            "text": "The growth of Oryza sativa cell suspensions in R-2 medium. Data points represent the averages of 3 or more flasks. The entire contents of the flasks were oven dried and weighed. Vertical lines represent standard deviations thylakoid percursors or prolamellar bodies. Since the cells were grown in the dark, the grana did not differentiate. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was abundant and the cisternae contained ribosomes(Fig. 3 B). Ribosomes generally were associated preferentially with the ER membranes (RER). Golgi bodies were common and had straight saccules with few vesicles(Fig. 3 C). Amyloplasts contained one or more starch grains(Fig. 3 C)and were usually elongated, oval or cup-shaped, with a thin parietal layer of granular stroma surrounding the starch. Amyloplasts rarely contained membrane inclusions and osmiophilic droplets. Some had a clear cavity around the starch grain (Fig. 3 C). Proplastids and amyloplasts were in different stages of division. A few vacuoles apparently were autolytic in incipient stages of differentiation(Fig. 3 D). Mitochondria were rounded and contained few internal membranes(Fig. 3 E). Fibrous structures were present in cytoplasm of some young cells; sometimes crossing the length of the cell(Fig. 2 A). These structures were unbounded by any membrane, and of linear substructure in longitudinal sections(Fig. 3 E). They were composed of fibers oriented approximately parallel to one another and were not associated with the ER or ribosomes. Their function is unknown and we are unaware of any previous reports describing similar structures in cells grown in suspension.11\"Fig. 2A.
