Within NME cases, the effect of variables on the duration of survival was assessed by the Cox proportional hazards analysis. Investigated factors included age and weight at onset of clinical signs, sex, month of onset of clinical signs, geographic location of primary residence, seasonal information, vaccination history, CSF characteristics, and administered treatments. Month of onset was categorized as winter (January\u2010March), spring (April\u2010June), summer (July\u2010September), or fall (October\u2010December). Client zip code information was used to determine the average temperature during the month of diagnosis.\na\n Primary location was first categorized into 7 regions based on states within the northeastern, mid\u2010Atlantic, southeastern, midwestern, southwestern, mountain plains, and western regions. Location was subsequently dichotomized as east or west of the Mississippi River and originating from a location north of 40\u00b0 latitude. Classification of client residence as urban, suburban, and rural was performed based on the reported client zip code.\nb\n Vaccine administration at any time before onset of clinical signs was recorded as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) for each of the following: rabies, distemper combination products, leptospirosis, bordetella, Lyme disease, giardia, coronavirus, and parvovirus. Additionally, the time (in days) between most recent vaccination and onset of clinical signs was determined. Bivariable Cox proportion hazards analysis was used to evaluate each variable individually with survival time, and P \u2264 .2 was considered significant for these screening models. Vaccination history was simply evaluated as a dichotomous variable in all Cox models. Multivariable modeling of survival time included those variables that were found to be statistically significant based on the bivariable analysis as a starting point for model building. Within NME cases, survival time was compared between treatment modalities by Mann\u2010Whitney U\u2010tests. One statistical package was used for calculating mid\u2010P\u2013adjusted exact binomial confidence intervals for proportions, and \u03c72 (Fisher exact) tests\nc\n and other analyses were performed using commercially available software.\nd\n Results were considered significant at P\u2264 .05.",

The proportion of females in the NME group, however, was significantly higher than a null assumption of a 50:50 male to female population (P= .01). The high proportion of females in the NME group is interesting, because autoimmune encephalopathies seem to be more common in females across several species. Several studies have shown that females are affected more commonly with GME than are males, with 1 large report indicating that 68% of cases were intact or spayed female dogs.\n23\n, \n27\n Females also are predisposed to developing multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), which are autoimmune demyelinating diseases of humans and rodents, respectively.\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n The mechanisms for female overrepresentation in EAE and MS are unclear, but may relate to sex steroid\u2010associated alterations in T\u2010helper 1 cytokines, suppression of T\u2010regulatory cells, X\u2010chromosome susceptibility alleles, or other factors.\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n Interestingly, local dysregulation of T\u2010cell behavior also is believed to be important in the development of GME.\n34\n Although the lesion distribution and histopathology of NME are distinct from GME, MS, and EAE, the similar sex bias associated with all 4 diseases may indicate a degree of overlap in etiopathogenesis. The high proportion of female Pugs in the NME group lends further support to the hypothesis that immune system dysfunction plays a role in lesion development.",

Immune\u2010mediated encephalitides in other species may have a seasonal bias in onset.

The high proportion of both cases and controls that resided in urbanized areas may simply be reflective of the number of Pugs in these regions, differences in client values between rural and urbanized areas, or a difference in environmental factors that influence the development of intracranial disease in general.",

Most dogs (8/14) had lymphocytic pleocytosis, with the remainder having mixed cell or large mononuclear pleocytosis. These data are similar to what has been described in 12 Pugs with NME, where pleocytosis was detected in all dogs (mean, 374 cells/\u03bcL; range, 71\u2013630) and inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic.\n1\n The CSF results in this report also resembled what has been reported in Yorkshire Terriers and Maltese with NME.

Because only Pugs with necropsy\u2010confirmed NME were included in our analysis, survival data may be biased toward Pugs with more severe disease and therefore falsely shortened. When treatments were divided into antimicrobials, ACDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs, only the administration of an ACD was significantly associated with prolonged survival. The administration of ACDs may be directly neuroprotective and enhance owner perceptions of quality of life. Prolonged seizure activity induces neuronal apoptosis via the activation of both extrinsic (eg, cell\u2010surface receptors) and intrinsic (eg, organelle) triggers.\n46\n Seizures also may damage neurons through glutamate\u2010mediated excitotoxicity and the induction of proinflammatory cytokines.\n47\n, \n48\n Although providing ACDs may help prevent development of these lesions, decreasing seizure frequency also will improve perceived quality of life and hence survival. In a recent report on idiopathic epilepsy, inadequate seizure control was recognized as a reason for decreased quality of life in 5/12 dogs.\n49\n The inclusion of dogs that did not receive treatments in comparison groups may have skewed results toward certain treatments having a favorable effect on survival. If dogs were not treated because euthanasia was deemed most appropriate, then short survival in this group may have confounded the comparison because untreated dogs had a worse prognosis (ie, confounding by indication to treat).",
