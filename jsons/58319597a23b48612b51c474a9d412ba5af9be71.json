Malignancy is one of the most common causes of exudative pleural effusions. In postmortem examinations of patients who died of cancer, the incidence of malignant effusion was 16% [1] . Carcinoma of any organ can metastasize to the pleura. However, lung cancer is the most common cause of malignant effusions with an incidence of 40%. When first evaluated, approximately 15% of that group of patients exhibited pleural effusion and up to 50% of the patients with an advanced disease may acquire a pleural effusion during the course of their disease [2\u00b14] . Breast cancer is the second cause with an incidence of 25%. Lymphomas account for 10% of all malignant effusions and are the most common cause of chylothorax. Other solid tumors, such as ovarian and gastric cancer, represent the 5% or less of malignant pleural effusions while in 3\u00b110% of patients the effusion is due to malignancy of unknown origin [5] . The incidence of mesothelioma varies according to the geographic location.",

Any interference in its path can result in a pleural effusion. Nevertheless, the latter mechanism cannot solely explain the formation of all malignant effusions. Firstly, these effusions are exudates and the normal pleural fluid has low protein concentration that makes its accumulation a transudate. Secondly, the rate of fluid formation is much higher than normal. The normal rate of pleural fluid formation is 0.01 mL/kg per hour. In many patients with malignant pleural effusions it is common for the fluid egress to exceed the 100 mL/ 24 h as measured through chest tube drainage. Thirdly, malignant cells are found in more than 90% of these effusions and in addition, many of them are bloody which can be justified only by the invasion of parietal pleura from the tumor as it obstructs the lacunae of the lymphatics.",

The presence of pleural metastases may increase the permeability of the capillaries in the visceral and/or parietal pleura. This also explains how malignant effusions are exudates.

The term \u00aaparamalignant effusions\u00ba refers to those effusions that are not a direct result of the pleura invasion from the tumor but are still related to the primary malignancy [2, 3] . Not all \u00aaparamalignant effusions\u00ba exclude operability in lung cancer. Important examples are the parapneumonic effusions due to postobstructive pneumonia and the transudate effusions secondary to postobstructive atelectasis. Other local effects (Table 49 .1) of the tumor causing \u00aaparamalignant effusions\u00ba are: (1) lymphatic obstruction, as mentioned before, (2) obstruction of the thoracic duct with the development of chylothorax, and (3) the trapped lung caused by extensive tumor involvement of visceral pleura. Systemic effects of the tumor can result in effusions with pulmonary embolism, hypoalbuminemia, and cachexia. In addition, adverse events of the therapy can also result in effusions. This category includes radiation therapy and antineoplastic drugs such as bleomycin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes.",

Decrease of the compliance of the chest wall, contralateral shift of the mediastinum, depression of the ipsilateral diaphragm, decrease in ipsilateral lung volume, and neurogenic reflexes from lung and chest wall may be considered as probable mechanisms. Obstructive pneumonitis, atelectasis, and malignant infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma may provoke additional causes of dyspnea.

            "text": "Diagnostic thoracentesis must be performed in any patient where a pleural effusion of more than 1 cm thick is detected in the lateral decubitus position. Almost all malignant pleural effusions are exudates with a protein concentration of about 4 g/dL. In some cases, such as the pleural fluid accumulation secondary to atelectasis or to lymph node involvement, they can be transudates. The differential cell count is useful to determine the etiology of the fluid. The malignant effusions are characteristically lymphocytic with a range of 50\u00b175% but certainly less than that which can be seen in tuberculous pleurisy (> 90%). The reason for this lymphocytosis is unclear. The lymphocytes are predominantly Ttype and appear to play a key role in local defense against tumor invasion. Pleural fluid eosinophilia (eosinophils > 10%) usually signifies a benign self-limited disease but it cannot exclude malignancy. The frequency of eosinophilia in malignant effusions varies from 10% to 40%. In some populations, eosinophilic effusions are as likely to be malignant as non-eosinophilic ones [2, 13, 14] . Polymorphonuclear leukocytes usually represent less than 25% of the cell population. Although malignancy is the most common cause of bloody effusions, at least half of them are not grossly hemorrhagic (RBC count < ;10,000 cells/mL). A bloody malignant pleural effusion can result from either direct invasion of blood vessels, increased capillary permeability caused by vasoactive substances produced from tumor cells, occlusion of venules, or tumor-induced angiogenesis [2] . Although the pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is used to distinguish transudative from exudative pleural effusions, it is not useful in the differential diagnosis of malignancy [15] . At the time of the diagnosis, approximately one third of malignant effusions are acidotic with a pH value less than 7. This low pH is associated with low glucose concentrations (< 60 mg/dL). The possible mechanism involves the spreading of the tumor within the pleural space. The abnormal thickening of the pleura prevents the glucose transport from blood to pleural fluid. The glucose that does enter the pleura is metabolized by normal and malignant cells to CO 2 and lactate. Additionally, the abnormal pleural barrier impairs the efflux of these end products of glucose metabolism from the pleural space, resulting in the fluid acidosis. Malignant effusions with low pH and glucose concentration are considered to have a higher initial diagnostic yield on cytological examination and a worse survival and response to pleurodesis than those with normal values. Pleural fluid pH correlates with survival [3, 16] . The amylase salivary isoenzyme of the fluid is elevated in 10\u00b114% of malignant effusions. In the absence of esophageal rupture, elevated values of fluid amylase establish the diagnosis of malignancy, especially lung adenocarcinoma.",

Cytological examination of pleural fluid is a fast, efficient, non-invasive, and more sensitive technique than the closed pleural biopsy. The percentage of malignant effusions which is diagnosed with cytology varies from 40% to 87% [3, 15] . The frequency of positive cytological results, if the effusion is not \u00aaparamalignant\u00ba, depends on the tumor type. Squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and sarcomas are less commonly positive. Obviously the frequency also depends on the skills of the cytologist. Overall, if three separate pleural fluid specimens are submitted to an experienced cytologist, the positive diagnosis is about 70\u00b180%. Some clinicians suggest that when the first suspicion is malignancy, several hundred milliliters of fluid should be removed at the initial diagnostic thoracentesis. This procedure, in the case of a negative initial cytological examination, involves the sucking of fluid with fewer degenerative mesothelial cells as well as freshly exfoliated malignant cells in a repeated thoracentesis [2] . In the decade since 1995, the use of other procedures, such as flow cytometry with DNA analysis and immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies to tumor markers, have been proposed in order to increase the diagnostic accuracy of cytology. Because of their low sensitivity and specificity of these techniques, they can only be used to assist in the diagnosis and not confirm it. Identification of DNA aneuploidy by flow cytometry may add to routine cytology by detecting false-negatives in the initial screening and warrant additional samples for further review. Flow cytometry with immunocytometry can identify the cell lineage (T or B cells) and the clonality of the population of lymphocytes. Therefore, it is useful when lymphoma is suspected. Immunohistochemical staining for tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Leu-M1, mucine, and B72.3 can be used in the differential diagnosis between adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma. If the specimen is positive for at least two of these antibodies, this is a likely indication for adenocarcinoma.",

The low sensitivity of this blind biopsy of the parietal pleura is mostly due to the distribution of tumor in unexamined areas and early stage of disease with minimal pleural involvement. Many physicians suggest that if malignancy is suspected and the cytology of thoracentesis is negative, thoracoscopy is then preferred over closed needle pleural biopsy reaching a diagnosis in more than 90% of cases. Medical thoracoscopy compared to surgical thoracoscopy, also known as \u00aavideo-assisted thoracic surgery\u00ba or \u00aaVATS,\u00ba can be performed under local anesthesia or conscious sedation and it is considerably less invasive and less expensive than VATS [22] . Medical thoracoscopy is primarily a diagnostic procedure but it can also be used for staging and in the treatment of malignant effusions. By thoracoscopy, we can achieve direct visualization of the pleural cavity and can obtain biopsies of the chest wall, the parietal or visceral pleura, the lung, the mediastinum, and the diaphragm. Thoracoscopy can also result in the complete evacuation of the pleural fluid, elimination of adhesions hindering lung expandability, and pleurodesis by talc poudrage. The diagnostic sensitivity of medical thoracoscopy is higher than that of both cytology and closed pleural biopsy (96% versus 74%, p < 0.001). The combination of all of these methods can result in a 97% diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions. The sensitivity of cytology compared to that of thoracoscopy did not vary among lung carcinomas (67% versus 96%), extrathoracic primary tumors (62% versus 96%), and diffuse malignant mesothelioma (58% versus 92%) [23] . The false-negative thoracoscopic results can be due to a physician's inexperience along with the presence of adhesions that prevent access to the neoplastic tissue. Adhesions can result from multiple attempts of therapeutic thoracentesis. Despite the great usefulness of the procedure, thoracic surgery backup should be available. VATS requires general anesthesia and single-lung ventilation. It usually combines diagnosis and treatment but it is a more extensive procedure than the medical one because several ports have to be used. VATS is not indicated when the patient cannot tolerate single-lung ventilation or if the pleural ad-hesions prevent the safe insertion of the thoracoscope. In those cases and if diagnosis remains elusive despite a successful exploratory thoracoscopy, thoracotomy is indicated when the patient has a good performance status.",

Clinical data and pleural fluid parameters are investigated. Pleural fluid pH and glucose concentration seems to have the best correlation with overall survival [23\u00b125]. Uncertainty remains for the thresholds of their values. A meta-analysis of 400 patients indicated that patients with pH values less than 7.28 had a 3-month survival rate of 38.9% compared to 61.6% for patients with values over this cutoff point. Although pH is a significant predictor of the duration of survival, accuracy is low and only 54.4% of the patients predicted by pH to die within 3 months were classified correctly. Decreasing the cutoff points of pH did not increase accuracy. This study also showed that the primary origin of malignancy influences survival. Patients with neoplasms of the lung, soft tissues, kidney, ovary, gastrointestinal tract, and oropharynx had a worse median survival. It is confirmed that pH correlates with the duration of survival but it cannot be clinically used for the selection of patients who should not undergo pleurodesis based on an estimated survival [26] . In the majority of studies, as well as in the meta-analysis, clinical data such as weight loss and Karnofsky performance status scores (KPS) were not taken into consideration. Performance status measured with Karnofsky's scale has a strong correlation with the survival of patients with lung cancer, other solid tumors, and lymphomas. In recurrent malignant effusions, performance status seems to be a significant predictor of survival. Patients with KPS of more than 70 have a median survival of 395 days, compared with only 34 days for those with KPS less than 30 [27] .",

Ideally, the chest tube must be directed posteriorly toward the diaphragm. Confirmation of lung re-expansion with X-ray shortly precedes pleurodesis [3] . A number of antineoplastic and non-antineoplastic agents are used for pleurodesis (Table 49.2). Sterilized asbestos-free talc (3 MgO, 4 SiO 2 , and H 2 O) consistently produces the highest success rates (> 90%) regardless of how it is implemented. It can be insufflated into the pleural space via medical or surgical thoracoscopy or administered in the form of slurry through a chest tube followed by tetracyclines (minocycline and doxycycline) and bleomycin. Minocycline and doxycycline have overall success rates of 73% but the unfortunate requirement of repeated doses and heavy local analgesia is thought to be the main drawback. Corynebacterium parvum has limited success while quinacrine can provoke serious toxicity in the central nervous system [2, 3, 32] . Bleomycin is an effective sclerosing agent with similar success rates to tetracycline. With bleomycin, however, there is less chest pain and fever. Generally, talc slurry appears to be more preferred due to its cost. The criticism over the use of bleomycin is that it is relatively more expensive compared with other agents. However, studies of its remarkable success rates have made bleomycin through small-bore chest tubes a more attractive, less invasive option as it reduces hospitalization time [2, 3, 30\u00b133] . Additionally, the use of a standard dose of 60 mg bleomycin mixed with 50\u00b1100 cm 3 of sterile saline can be replaced effectively with a lower dose of 30 mg when careful selection is made of patients with no evidence of trapped lung [30] .",

After the pleural cavity has been drained, no more than 5 g talc must be instilled into pleural space as slurry or poudrage. The tube should be closed for 1\u00b1 2 h after instillation. With slurry, the patient must be repositioned. Slow progressive suction can be applied if trapped lung is suspected. The chest tube can be safely removed when drainage is less than 150 mL/day, usually within 48 h. If after 48 h and up until 72 h the chest tube drainage is still large (> 250 mL/day), re-instillation of the same dose of talc can be performed [3] . Talc is an inexpensive and highly effective agent. The most common complications seen in talc administration are pain and fever. Pain is ranged from non-existing to severe and can be easily controlled by the administration of local anesthesia and parenteral analgesia before the procedure. Fever is mild, probably related to the inflammatory process, and characteristically occurs 4\u00b112 h after instillation. More serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute pneumonitis, and respiratory failure have been reported. They are mostly related to dose and particle size [3, 34, 35] . Long-term complications, such as an increasing incidence of lung cancer, have not been documented with asbestos-free products [3] .",

For years, scientists believed that inflammatory cells were responsible for the fibrosis but this hypothesis can not explain the rapidness of the fibrotic procedure. The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) appears to be the cornerstone of the fibrotic cascade. bFGF is a strong mitogen for fibroblasts and, as seen in in vitro studies, pleural mesothelial cells release high levels of biologically active bFGF after talc stimulation. Additionally, it has been proven that normal mesothelial cells synthesize higher amounts of bFGF than malignant ones, indicating that the presence of normal mesothelium is important for the rapid release of bFGF and, also, for a successful pleurodesis. This can support the use of talc pleurodesis by clinicians at an early stage, rather than a later one, and even for asymptomatic patients, it can be implemented before the pleura is diffusely covered with malignant deposits [32, 36] .",

The most common is shunt occlusion (12%) and in this case, a replacement is mandatory.

All histological types can metastasize in the pleura but the most frequent is adenocarcinoma, probably because of its peripheral location. For patients with malignant effusion from non-small cell lung cancer, chemotherapy is not the first treatment strategy. Palliative local therapy includes careful drainage of the pleural cavity. If the patient is a candidate for pleurodesis, intrapleural application of a sclerotic agent (talc slurry or poudrage, bleomycin, or doxycycline) is performed.

It has been accepted that 46% of patients with disseminating breast cancer will develop pleural metastases. The median time from the initial diagnosis until the development of pleural effusion is 41.5 months with a range of 0 to 246 months [3] . In a retrospective study of 3,856 women with a history of invasive breast carcinoma, Pokieser et al. analyzed the correlation between the site of the primary tumor and the probability to develop a malignant effusion. When the primary tumor was located in the inner quadrants, the probability of malignant pleural or pericardial effusion was 4 times higher [47] . The clinical usefulness of this observation is that a more aggressive adjuvant therapy can be administered to a particular subset of patients with breast cancer. The survival after the onset of effusion is better for breast cancer patients compared to lung cancer ones. It is related to the presence of metastatic sites of the disease in other organs. The median survival is 48 months if pleural effusion is the only evidence of recurrence and 12 months when disseminating disease is present. The diagnosis of malignant effusion due to breast cancer is relatively uncomplicated (by cytological examination of pleural fluid) and more invasive procedures are rarely demanded [48] . The expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in primary breast tumors is undoubtedly related to the prognosis. The expression of these receptors from metastatic pleural tissue can interfere with the survival of the patient but this hypothesis remains to be confirmed since there is a lack of data [49] . Other prognostic factors such as chromosomal changes, as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are under investigation but a greater number of prospective studies need to be conducted [50] . The mechanisms of pleural metastases are either through lymphatic spread, which results in an ipsilateral effusion, or through hematogenous spread, which is usually accompanied by hepatic metastases and is associated with bilateral or contralateral effusion. A less common mechanism is the direct invasion through the chest wall. Ipsilateral localization is detected in 50% of patients while contralateral localization is in 40%. Bilateral is seen in 10% of these patients [3, 51] . Systemic chemotherapy and hormone therapy are the recommended first-line therapies for recurrent breast cancer and malignant effusion. If chemotherapy is ineffective or contraindicated, local therapy must be considered. Talc pleurodesis remains the best choice with a tendency to talc insufflation through thoracostomy rather than talc slurry [44] . Distinguishing between pleural effusions due to metastases and those due to post-radiation therapy is important. The latter can occur after adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with breast tumor after segmentectomy. Post-radiation effusions are usually presented within 6 months after radiation and are resolved spontaneously.",

Fluid characteristics are mostly in accordance with exudate criteria than transudate criteria. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common cause of chylothorax [5, 52] . The mechanism of fluid accumulation is blockage of the lymphatic drainage either from mediastinal nodal invasion (Hodgkin's disease) or direct infiltration of the pleura (non-Hodgkin disease). Although the diagnostic usefulness of fluid cytological examinations varies from 30% to 55% (the lowest sensitivity seen in Hodgkin's disease), chromosomal analysis has a higher sensitivity of up to 85%. The application of flow cytometry by using immunocytometry can identify cell lineage (T or B cells) as well as the clonality of the population of lymphocytes [15] . The average overall survival time is usually short and positive fluid cytology is associated with a poor prognosis. Systemic chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for malignant effusions due to lymphomas. Palliative local treatments with sclerosing agents can be provided to achieve relief of symptoms. Mediastinal radiation can help in the resolution of symptomatic pleural effusion when mediastinal node enlargement is the cause of impaired lymphatic drainage. Pleuroperitoneal shunt is a fair approach for patients with chylothorax and chemotherapy failure as chyle is recirculated [3, 53] .",

            "text": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has an incidence which varies according to the geographic location. The disease is related to asbestos exposure with predominance in the population of males between 50 and 70 years of age. A long latency period is observed between time of exposure and the development of the disease with a mean time of 40 years (range of 14\u00b172 years). Three histological types of MPM are identified: epithelial, mixed, and sarcomatous. Sarcomatous and mixed types are associated with poor prognosis as well as poor performance status, chest pain, and weight loss. They have a platelet count greater than 400,000/ L, a serum lactate dehydrogenase of more than 500 IU/lL, low hemoglobin levels, high white blood cell count, and are usually greater than 75 years of age [55, 56] . The most recent retrospective studies imply that the simian virus 40 (SV40) correlates with the development of MPM that has a poor prognosis [57] . The importance of molecular biology in cancer research must demonstrate some revolutionary deductions. The analysis of pretherapeutic gene expression in mesothelioma biopsies can predict the clinical outcome of the patient, independently of the histological type [58] , and the resistance to treatment [59] . Today, with the use of histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques, along with electron microscopic analysis, it is possible to obtain a diagnosis of MPM from pleural effusion in 84% of cases, starkly contrasting the once low diagnostic accuracy of only 33% derived from the cytological examination of pleural fluid associated with mesothelioma. Thoracoscopy (medical or surgical) remains the gold standard for diagnosis and staging. In reviewing the literature, there is no clearly identifiable therapeutic strategy for resectable pleural mesothelioma. Patients who are candidates for surgery are those who theoretically can achieve a complete resection of tumor (stage I\u00b1III). The percentage of 2-and 5-year survival time for stage I is 65% and 30%, respectively [60] but a long-term survival for all \u00aaresectable\u00ba stages is disappointing with a median survival ranging from 9 to 17.3 months [56] . The strategy of a multimodal treatment approach, despite the lack of large phase III trials, appears to be a justifiable choice. Large, but not randomized, reports indicate an improved median survival (13\u00b117 months) for patients with multimodal treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy) compared to the best supportive care (median survival of 7 months) [60, 61] . It is of great importance to notice that these trials were conducted before the arrival of the new antifolates (pemetrexed and raltitrexed) which have changed the course of chemotherapy in MPM. Based on good results of induction/neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, Weder et al. [62] conducted a neoadjuvant trial for patients with potential operable MPM. They used an acceptable doubled combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine (response rates of 16\u00b148% [63] ) for 3 cycles followed by surgery and radiotherapy. Their promising results of median survival of 23 months need further confirmation by larger randomized trials.",

Many chemotherapeutic agents have been tested as single agents in MPM with disappointing results.

In 2003, the results from a large phase III trial by Vogelzang et al. [65] have changed the role of chemotherapy in MPM. The investigators concluded that the use of a cisplatin plus pemetrexed regimen, compared to a single regimen of cisplatin, improves median survival, pulmonary function tests, and any disease-related symptoms. Another phase III study conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) that also used a double regimen of a new antifolate raltitrexed and cisplatin, resulted in equally encouraging data with median survival of approximately 12 months. The novel antifolate pemetrexed is a multitargeted inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The main toxicities of the double regimen are hematological, with neutropenia grade 3\u00b14 (28%) and leukocytopenia (18%) being the predominant ones. The data of this phase III international study provided level 1 evidence for the treatment of mesothelioma patients with a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin.",

The novel technology of gene therapy can be the answer to many malignancies and to malignant effusions, if problems such as therapeutic gene transfer are resolved in the years to come [67, 68] . l Malignancy is one of the most common causes of exudative pleural effusions, since in postmortem examinations of patients who died of cancer, the incidence of malignant effusion was 16%. l Lung cancer is the most common cause of malignant effusions with an incidence of 40%. When first evaluated, approximately 15% of lung cancer patients exhibit pleural effusion and up to 50% of the patients with an advanced disease may acquire a pleural effusion during the course of their disease. l Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common histological type associated with malignant pleural infusion; it spreads by contiguity due to its peripheral location and has the propensity to invade the vessels. l The term \u00aaparamalignant effusions\u00ba refers to those effusions that are not a direct result of the pleura invasion from the tumor but are still related to the primary malignancy.
