Inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in water by LED treatment has been studied extensively. LED technology has also shown antimicrobial efficacy in food systems. This review provides an overview of recent studies of LED decontamination of water and food. LEDs produce an antibacterial effect by photodynamic inactivation due to photosensitization of light absorbing compounds in the presence of oxygen and DNA damage; however, such inactivation is dependent on the wavelength of light energy used. Commercial applications of LED treatment include air ventilation systems in office spaces, curing, medical applications, water treatment, and algaculture. As low penetration depth and high-intensity usage can challenge optimal LED treatment, optimization studies are required to select the right light wavelength for the application and to standardize measurements of light energy dosage.",

Conventional approaches, such as UV light emitted by mercury vapor lamps or pulsed light produced in xenon lamps, have been used to inactivate microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and fungi. Disadvantages of these treatments include the possibility of contamination by mercury residues, and a short life span of equipment. Lightemitting diodes (LED) made of semiconductor materials and producing monochromatic light have been used in agriculture and the food industry, as they have several advantages over conventional sources. For example, harmful microorganisms in food and water can be eliminated by light with specific wavelengths and pulsed or continuous modes of operation, making LEDs effective. LEDs are nonhazardous (no mercury), and their compact size makes them easy to incorporate into existing food processing applications. LEDs offer high performance, robustness, a long lifetime (> 10,000 h), low power use, and cost effectiveness, making them a promising option for effective disinfection and for plant growth applications [119] . This review explains the fundamentals of LED applications to microbial inactivation in different food products and water. It describes the potential quality changes in recipients of LED treatment, the mechanisms of microbial inactivation during treatments using light of different wavelengths, and the challenges and future opportunities for LED technology in the food processing sector.",

LEDs work on the principle of electroluminescence, that is, they produce light upon application of an electric or a magnetic field. In an electric or a magnetic field, excited electrons reach lower energy states by emitting light and releasing energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. LED is a semiconductor material doped with impurities that create a boundary or interface (known as a p-n junction) between two types of semiconductor materials, one type (the positive or p-type) having an excess of holes and the other type (the negative or n-type) having an excess of electrons. The color and the wavelength of the light emitted depends on the semiconductors and the impurities used in the LED formation (Table 1) . LEDs are similar to conventional diodes, with the p-side called the anode and the n-side called the cathode. Additionally, the diode consists of a nonconducting region between the p and n sides, known as the depletion region [41] .",

            "text": "LEDs consist of a chip of semiconductor material doped with certain impurities that enable it to emit light of a particular color and wavelength. A p-type semiconductor can be formed by impregnating a group II element such as magnesium (Mg) into a group III element substrate to provide extra holes in the substrate. An n-type semiconductor is formed by doping a group IVelement into a group III element substrate to provide extra free electrons in the substrate. The extra holes on the p-side and the free electrons on the n-side fuse together at the p-n junction to form a nonconducting, depletion region [12] . A radiative recombination of free electrons and holes is an important event in the LED system. On the passage of electric current through the LED, the higher energy electrons in the conduction band (the n-side) combine with the holes in the p-side forming electron-hole pairs, and move to the valence band of the p-type semiconductor where the energy is lower (compared to the n band with its free electrons) (Fig. 1 ). This bandgap can either be direct, where momentum is conserved, or indirect, where momentum is not conserved and the transition is lower. The transition can be improved by the addition of isoelectronic traps [25] . The difference between the energy of the free electrons and the energy of the electron-hole pairs (i.e., the band gap energy) is emitted as photons, carriers of electromagnetic radiation of certain color and wavelength (Fig. 1) . Highly efficient LEDs are based on group III-V semiconductors and are formed by direct band gap alloys. Varying the chemical compositions of these alloys can vary the band gap energy and hence the wavelength of the light emitted. On applying the law of conservation of energy with an assumption that the thermal energy produced is much less than photon energy produced, the energy produced in the form of light will be equal to the bandgap of the diodes [117] :",

Equations 1 and 2 clearly satisfy the fact that material with the higher conduction band is needed to emit a smaller wavelength of light and vice versa. For instance, AlGaN has a larger bandgap than GaN and InGaN, so it is preferred over the others to produce deep UV light (wavelengths shorter than 365 nm) or near UV light (320-400 nm) [6, 16] . Packaging of a LED chip can affect the efficiency of a LED system. For example, if the packaging film absorbs most of the light emitted by a LED source due to total internal reflection, the amount of light perceived by the human eye is affected, thus varying the overall luminous efficiency. Overall luminous efficiency provides the efficiency of a light source to convert the electrical energy into the optical power perceived by a human eye in standard conditions. The voltage and current requirements of a LED varies based on the semiconductor material used in the diode and the wavelength of the light emitted; usually the voltage ranges from 1.5 to 3 V and the current ranges from 10 to 30 mA [41] . Regulation of the electric current and the duty ratio (proportion of time operated) helps to regulate the light intensity and the spectral output of the LED.",

            "text": "The efficacy of LED treatments of solid foods depends on the type and nature of the food products and components, the water activity (a w ), and the food surface morphology. Parameters such as light wavelength, treatment duration, dose, illumination temperature, relative humidity, and microbiological parameters are also important. Ready-to-eat fresh cut fruits have a high market demand. These products are stored in refrigerators, but they are susceptible to resistant microorganisms, although the growth of such organisms is limited at low temperatures. LEDs have shown promising antibacterial effectiveness in such products, although their antibacterial efficacy is affected by many product and process parameters, including type of product, composition, treatment temperature, and environmental conditions. LEDs emitting light at 405 nm induced a reduction of 1-1.2 log CFU/cm 2 (colony forming units per cm 2 ) in fresh-cut papaya inoculated with Salmonella. The papaya was treated with a total dose of 1.7 kJ/cm 2 at a set temperature of 4\u00b0C for 48 h [58] . The antibacterial effectiveness of 405 nm LEDs was supported by another study on fresh-cut mango by Kim et al. [59] , where the cell counts in a three strain cocktail of E. coli O157:H7, three serotypes of L. monocytogenes, and five serotypes of Salmonella spp. were reduced to less than 1.6 log CFU/cm 2 with a total dose of 2.6-3.5 kJ/cm 2 for 36-48 h. The E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in the cocktail culture were reduced to below the detection limit with 36 h of treatment at 4\u00b0C and at 10\u00b0C, indicating that the antibacterial efficacy of the LED is dependent on the type of bacteria. The sterilization effects of visible light LED treatment on fresh-cut fruits has also been studied. Ghate et al. [36] tested the antibacterial effects of a 460 nm LED at different illumination temperatures and irradiances on fresh-cut pineapples infected with a cocktail of S. enterica. A maximum reduction of 1.72 log CFU/g was achieved with 92 mW/cm 2 irradiance at 16\u00b0C illumination temperature. Varying the irradiances had insignificant effects on the inactivation. High energy doses used for long times with small reductions in target pathogens may limit the practical applications of LED treatment unless the antimicrobial efficacy is improved.",

LEDs, an emerging nonthermal antibacterial technology, have been tested on contaminated seafoods. In a study by Josewin et al. [47] , the efficacy of a blue LED (460 nm) with a riboflavin photosensitizer was studied on smoked salmon inoculated with a 4-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes. The synergistic effects of an LED (15 mW/cm 2 ) and riboflavin (100 \u03bcM) produced reductions of 1.2 and 1.1 log CFU/cm 2 at surrounding temperatures of 4\u00b0C and 12\u00b0C, respectively. The LED treatment of seafoods might render it susceptible to a subsequent acidic condition. This was reported in a study of ready-to-eat salmon inoculated with L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. cocktail. A 405 nm LED treatment for 8 h with a total dose of 460.8 J/ cm 2 , produced a reduction of 0.4 and 0.3 log CFU/cm 2 in cell counts of L. monocytogenes and a 0.5 log reduction of Salmonella spp. at 4\u00b0C and at 12\u00b0C. Although the inactivation was low, both bacteria had a reduced D-values (time required to reduce 90% of the population in simulated gastric fluid) compared to untreated samples, and the treated samples were more sensitive to simulated gastric fluid. However, this effect varied for both strains, as Salmonella spp. (gramnegative) showed more susceptibility than L. monocytogenes (gram-positive), indicating that the treatment inactivated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria differentially [73] .",

As cooking meat kills pathogens but also decreases the meat's nutritional value, it is a challenge to choose an optimal cooking time and an optimal cooking temperature. Kim et al. [57] measured the effect on S. Enteritidis inoculated on cooked with a pulsed LED emitting light at 405 nm. A total dose of 3.8 kJ/cm 2 at 4\u00b0C produced a reduction of 0.8-0.9 log CFU/cm 2 . A similar experiment at room temperature produced a smaller reduction in S. Enteritidis. LED systems can be designed to produce either continuous or pulsed treatments, according to the objective requirements, but treatment efficiencies can vary based on the design. This aspect was reported in recent research conducted on white mushrooms and commercial ready-to-eat sausages. Pulsed UV-C LED treatment with 20 Hz frequency and a duty ratio of 50% showed better antibacterial efficacy than continuous UV-C LED treatment against three-strain cocktails containing E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes. Continuous treatment resulted in 2, 1.5, and 2 log reductions, whereas pulsed LED at a 5 J/cm 2 dosage resulted in 3, 4, and 4 log reductions in E. coli, Salmonella, and Listeria, respectively, in ready-to-eat sausage.

Compared to water, liquid foods are complex systems containing pigments, fibers, and insoluble particles, and the turbidity and color of liquid foods can affect the antimicrobial efficacy of LED treatments. Lian et al. [74] used a UVA-LED to evaluate its disinfection activity in both colored solutions and orange juice inoculated with E. coli DH5\u03b1. Different food colors, carotenoids, the flavonoid carthamus yellow, and mixed food colorants of melon color-L, and grape color RCG were prepared at different concentrations from 0.001 to 0.1% with E. coli DH5\u03b1, and UVA-LED light of 126 J/cm 2 was used to treat the solutions [74] . This amount of energy used was huge however, technically possible, especially with 365, 395 and 455 nm LEDs. The authors used UV-A LEDs with 70 mW/cm 2 intensity for 30 min. There are a number of studies reported, showing huge energy dose of UV-A and blue light pulses emitted from LEDs, used for microbial inactivation in various solid/liquid food matrices [57] [58] [59] 73] . However, the reported energy doses of UV-C LEDs were significantly lower as mentioned in this and previous sections, compared to other wavelengths. Lower antimicrobial activity after LED treatment was obtained at higher concentrations of colored solutions and the log reductions in cell counts in different colored solutions were diverse. A maximum log reduction of 1.75 log CFU/ml was achieved in the 0.001% \u03b2carotene colored solution which was still far lower than the 2.5 log reduction in the control phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Similar results were obtained in orange juice, in which the log reduction was much lower than that of the transparent control solution after treatment. Pigments and other suspended particles in liquid foods may reflect and scatter the light, reducing the LED efficiency of bacteria elimination. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm) light are central to the bactericidal effect, the antioxidant activity of food colors such as carotenoids in liquid foods can be reduced, resulting in oxidation and quality change. LEDs emitting blue light (400 nm-480 nm) were tested for their ability to destroy pathogens in orange juice and milk [35, 120] . A 2 to 5 log reduction of Salmonella was observed in pasteurized orange juice inoculated with a cocktail of Salmonella and treated with a 460 nm LED at different irradiance and temperature combinations [35] . Conditions that produced the highest Salmonella inactivation were 92 mW/cm 2 with very long treatment time of 13.6 h at a huge energy dosage of 4500 J/cm 2 at 12\u00b0C. Authors maintained the irradiance of 92, 147.7 and 254.7 mW/cm 2 by adjusting the distance of the sample from the 460 nm LED and used a total dosage of 4500 J/ cm 2 for the treatment by regulating the treatment times corresponding to 13.6, 8.46 and 4.91 h, respectively. The long treatment time and the enormous energy used on products during LED treatments need to be justified if this technology using UV-A and blue light pulses should be developed for commercial disinfection of food products. One approach would be exploring the use of this technology for other applications (e.g., heating or drying, as huge energy used will heat and remove water from products) along with microbial inactivation, simultaneously. Srimagal et al. [120] compared the inactivation of E. coli in milk using blue LEDs at 405, 433, and 460 nm at 5, 10, and 15\u00b0C and treatment times of 0 to 90 min. Microbial inactivation was highest at elevated temperatures and lower wavelengths, with a maximum of 5.27 log CFU/ml reduction of E. coli O157:H7 after 60 min irradiation at 405 nm. The 460 nm LED resulted in a 2 to 5 log reduction, with a stronger effect on bacterial inactivation at higher temperatures, similar to the findings reported in Ghate et al. [35] . Both these studies noticed significant changes in food product colors (orange juice and milk) after exposure to blue LEDs, suggesting that the blue LED altered the quality of the liquid foods. LED lights in the blue range lower bacterial activity mainly through photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of the microorganisms. The photons produced with the LED light can be absorbed by endogenous photosensitizers (e.g., porphyrins, cytochromes, flavins) and NADH in bacteria, which are sensitized after being illuminated [29, 77] as described in the \"LED Fundamentals\" section. Srimagal et al. [120] reported an optimum condition (405 nm, 13.8\u00b0C, for 37.83 min) under which treated milk was pasteurized with no change in physicochemical properties in comparison to untreated milk. Also, when refrigerated, the shelf-life of the treated milk increased significantly to almost twice of that of untreated milk.",

The combinations of emission wavelengths included 280 nm/365 nm, 280 nm/405 nm, 254 nm/365 nm, 254 nm/405 nm, and 254 nm/280 nm/365 nm/405 nm. The highest antimicrobial activity was achieved when the cloudy apple juice was treated with 280 nm alone and a 280 nm/365 nm combination, with log reductions of 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 and 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 log CFU/mL, respectively, on LED treatment of 40 min. A significantly greater inactivation was observed in the clear apple juice than in the cloudy apple juice. The highest log reduction was obtained at 4.4 log CFU/mL in the clear apple juice treated solely with 280 nm (771.6 mJ/cm 2 , 40 min). The hybrid system treated with 280 and 365 nm UV-LEDs resulted in log reductions of 3.9 \u00b1 0.2 log CFU/mL, similar to the 280 nm treatment of cloudy apple juice for the same treatment time (40 min) . It was also demonstrated that these hybrid LED treatments showed better inactivation effects on polyphenol oxidase. Even though the fully pasteurized state (~5 log reductions) could not be accomplished in apple juice by the combined UVA and UVC LEDs, this study suggests that UVA and UVC LEDs have a synergistic potential for disinfection, with a potential to preserve food colors. An additional disinfection effect might be obtained by increasing the dosage of the UVA and UVC LEDs. The higher efficiency of the UV LED combination and their low energy consumption make them more advantageous than traditional mercury lamps for polyphenol oxidase inactivation. Studies on the inactivation effect of LEDs on liquid systems are listed in Table 3 .",

[119] reported the inactivation of microorganisms such as E. coli and coliphage MS2 in laboratory water, and E. coli and total coliform in wastewater, with continuous and pulsed 265 nm LED treatments. The inactivation levels of Lian et al. [74] all microorganisms were similar for both continuous and pulsed LED treatments at different pulse patterns under equivalent UV energy dosage. The pulsed LED treatments inactivated microorganisms as effectively as pulses produced by conventional xenon lamps, providing high output thermal management for water disinfection. Li et al. [70] evaluated the inactivation of E. coli with 265 and 280 nm LED treatments, individually and in 265, 280 (50%) nm and 265, 280 (75%) nm combinations. A comparative study of E. coli photoreactivation and dark repair was also quantitatively conducted with LEDs and LPUV. The results showed that a 265, 280 nm LED combination did not have any synergistic effect on E. coli inactivation. Reactivation of the 265 nm LED treated bacteria was comparable to the LPUV-treated bacteria. E. coli treated with 280 nm LEDs at 6.9 mJ/cm 2 showed the lowest percentage of photoreactivation and dark repair. This study concluded that, in water, the 280 nm LED inactivated E. coli more efficiently than the 265 nm LED due to the additional output power of the former and its better inhibition of bacterial reactivation. The synergistic antimicrobial efficacy of 260 nm and the 280 nm LEDs was evaluated against E. coli, B. pumilus spores, MS2 coliphage, and human adenovirus type 2 (HAdV2), and its efficacy was compared with mercury vapor lamps at low and medium pressures. The 260 nm LED was the most suitable for the inactivation of MS2 coliphage, whereas a medium pressure UV lamp inactivated HAdV2 and B. pumilus more efficiently than other UV sources [8] . Similar observations were made in a study by Sholtes et al. [114] , where the inactivation of E. coli B, B. atrophaeus, and MS2 were subjected to a 260 nm LED and low pressure UV lamps. E. coli B and MS-2 inactivation kinetics were similar with LED and LPUV treatments. For all UV radiation sources, the doses required for a 4 log reduction in microorganisms were higher for B. atrophaeus and MS2 than for E. coli B. Chatterley and Linden [17] treated E. coli in water with a 265 nm LED and conventional LPUV. The LED provided a higher antimicrobial efficacy than LPUV lamps but resulted in a higher disinfection cost. Gross et al. [37] reported water disinfection using a 280 nm LED to inactivate E. coli and B. subtilis with two different glass (soda lime and quartz) guided lights to increase the disinfection efficiency. Almost all the radiated light was guided to the samples due to total reflection. The rate and efficiency of disinfection of B. subtilis and E. coli were improved by this light-guided method.",

Light wavelength combinations (265/310, 265/280/310, 280/310, and 265/ 280 nm) were tested for their inactivation efficacy [92] . The time-dependent inactivation efficacy was a maximum with 280 nm LEDs, while 265 nm LEDs exhibited the highest fluence dependent efficiency. In the batch system, 265 and 280 nm LEDs required a dose of 10.8 and 13.8 mJ/cm 2 for achieving 4 log reduction in E. coli. The 310 nm LED required Ghate et al. [35] 56.9 mJ/cm 2 dose for just 0.6 log inactivation. Lower inactivation efficacy and decreased output power were observed with combined emissions at 265/280, 265/310, 280/310, and 265/280/310 nm in a flow-through reactor. The 265 nm LED treatment efficiency in water disinfection was also time dependent [91] . The results indicated that the sample turbidity influenced the bacterial inactivation, and better efficiency was achieved in less turbid water samples. These results suggest that particle accumulation in liquids can protect microorganisms from UV light exposure. Hamamoto et al. [38] disinfected water with UV-A LEDs (365 nm) and a low pressure UV-C lamp (254 nm). Inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, enteropathogenic E. coli, and E. coli DH5\u03b1 was greater than 3 log CFU/ml after 80 min of high energy UV-A LED treatment. This observation was supported in a study by Mori et al. [85] , in which a 365 nm (UV-A) LED showed antimicrobial effects against E. coli DH5\u03b1, Enteropathogenic E. coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Enteritidis. Vilhunen et al. [126] observed the effect of 269 and 276 nm on E. coli inactivation in two photolytic batch reactors differing in the wavelength emitted with different test mediums, including ultrapure water, nutrient and water, and nutrient and water with humic acids. The LEDs were efficient for E. coli destruction even at low optical power. The study showed that the LED wavelengths were effective for E. coli inactivation, but the test medium did not have much impact on the inactivation.",

Water disinfection with a single wavelength was compared with water disinfection using a combination of two wavelengths. However, the data were not consistent, so there was no conclusion made. The fact that different microorganisms respond differently to light energy of same wavelength can be ascribed to the UV light source, the fluence rate, the UV dose, and the exposure time. There is a need to develop a standard operating method to determine the dosage required for microbial inactivation in water [118] , and to determine the mechanism of LED microbial inactivation.",

            "text": "Light energy in the 320-400 nm range can produce oxidative stress, protein damage, and inhibition or delay of growth without killing the microorganisms irradiated [136] . For instance, a 405 nm LED showed antibacterial activity against the gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus, damaging the bacterial membrane, although the bacterial DNA was not damaged by the oxidative stress [54] . Kim et al. [55] also reported no DNA degradation in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria after treatment of L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei with a 405 nm LED. However, DNA oxidation and damages to efflux pump activity and the glucose uptake system due to ROS production were observed after LED treatment of Salmonella spp. with 405 nm LED at refrigerated conditions. In similar studies, refrigerated bacteria showed membrane damage, apart from the damage caused by the LED treatment [52] . ROS produced by LED illumination is believed to oxidize the guanine bases in DNA and peroxidate lipids in the cell membrane. However, no significant lipid peroxidation was observed, whereas DNA oxidation was observed, when fresh-cut papaya infected with Salmonella was subjected to a 405 nm LED; in the same experiment, the LED did not produce any significant effect on the organoleptic properties of fruit at refrigeration temperature [58] . Kim and Kang [50] observed no significant loss in the membrane integrity of gram-negative bacteria E. coli O157:H7 and gram-positive bacteria L. monocytogenes pulsed with a UV-C LED emitting light of wavelength 280 nm, whereas the membrane potential values were significantly changed. Moreover, a high membrane lipid peroxidation was observed in both the strains, but it was higher in L. monocytogenes. The LED treatments might reduce the activity of succinate-coenzyme Q, an electron transport chain enzyme involved in the production of energy and cell proliferation in bacterial cells [50] . This possibility was supported by LED illumination of Pseudomonas aerugenosa with wavelengths of 464 nm (blue), 528 nm (green), and 636 nm (red). The red and green LEDs did not inactivate the bacteria. A catalase A (enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide) mutant strain showed more sensitivity than the wild strain to the blue LED treatment, and overexpression of catalase A increased the sensitivity of the wild strain to the irradiation, indicating that hydrogen peroxide was a major ROS during the LED treatment [96] . Addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger mannitol did not affect the inactivation of E. coli DH5\u03b1 when treated with UV-A followed by UV-C LED, indicating that the hydroxyl radical might not have any role in the inactivation. On the contrary, it was observed that production of the hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide had a major role in UV-A LED inactivation, as the reduction of E. coli DH\u03b1 decreased with the addition of mannitol [39] . The cytotoxic response of bacteria to 405 nm LED treatment was further studied in S. epidermidis, where the antimicrobial effect of the LED was significantly decreased in the presence of sodium pyruvate (hydrogen peroxide scavenger), but a decrease was not observed in the presence of dimethyl thiourea (hydroxyl . This suggests that hydrogen peroxide played a greater role than the hydroxyl radical in the microbial inactivation [106] . HPLC analysis by reversed-phase chromatography of P. aeruginosa samples showed expressed coproporphyrin III, suggesting the production of endogenous porphyrins in the bacteria, which would explain the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) effect of blue light [3] .",

For instance, cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation was enhanced in E. coli ATCC15597 due to a 265 and 280 nm LED hybrid irradiation. Also, the recA protein, a core protein in the repair of the cell after an SOS response, was overexpressed [131] . CPD generation in E. coli DH\u03b1 was more pronounced with UV-C irradiation than with UV-A irradiation, which produced minimal E. coli DH\u03b1 CPD, indicating that UV-A treatment induced less damage than UV-C treatment to E. coli DH\u03b1 DNA [39] . LED treatment with 280 nm light inhibited the photoreactivation and dark repair compared to the more germicidal 265 nm light in normal conditions and these LED treatments further resisted the compromised DNA repair mechanisms in the bacteria [70] . These results are supported by an earlier study on the oxidative stress by NUV light on S. Typhimurium, where long exposure to low-intensity NUV light resulted in bacterial demise, probably due to oxidative stress and inhibition of the oxyR regulon, which plays a major role in triggering bacteria defense against stress. Long exposure to low-intensity NUV light also rendered the cells sensitive to further sterilization techniques [64] .",

Gram-negative bacteria are encased in a thin peptidoglycan layer sandwiched between an inner and relatively impermeable outer membrane, which maintains the rigidity of the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas a thick peptidoglycan layer and a single membrane encase gram-positive bacteria [88, 113] . At high pH, the cytoplasmic membranes of gramnegative bacteria leaked, while gram-positive bacteria were resistant [83] . Ghate et al. [34] found that the gram-negative bacteria Salmonella and E. coli were sensitive to 461 nm LED treatment in alkaline pH, while the gram-positive bacteria L. monocytogenes were sensitive to 461 nm LED treatment in acidic conditions. E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei were sensitive to bile salts after 405 nm LED treatment due to the loss of membrane integrity. The lack of an outer membrane probably made the gram-positive bacteria sensitive to acidic conditions and the solubilization of the outer membrane of the gram-negative bacteria made it more sensitive to the alkaline pH [34, 55] . S. enterica Enteritidis that contaminated cooked chicken were subjected to 405 nm LED on agar plates supplemented with antibiotics specific to cell wall, protein, DNA, and RNA. The 405 nm LED made these sites more sensitive to the antibiotics and the S. enterica Enteritidis were metabolically inhibited by 32.5, 24.2, 30.1, 44. 1%, suggesting that the antibacterial efficacy was linked to cellular damage [57] . The inactivation of E. coli and the production of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) after UV-A (365 nm) LED treatment indicated that the presence of oxygen played a major role in the DNA damage, as the DNA damage was reduced significantly when the same experiment was performed under anaerobic conditions [39] .",

In methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 460 nm LED treatment induced upregulation of phage-related genes, activating prophages into phages and thus causing cell lysis [133] . Adenovirus, a resistant waterborne pathogen residing in both treated and wastewater systems, consists of core proteins that play a major role in the adenovirus infection of a host [110] . Possibly, UV light produces its antimicrobial effects by damaging viral proteins. This hypothesis was supported when UV light of less than 240 nm from a germicidal UV spectrum lamp damaged viral proteins, inducing protein aggregation in adenovirus 2 [9] . The maximum reductions were observed in hexon and penton proteins. Proteins tend to absorb light of lower wavelengths, whereas nucleic acids tend to absorb light of higher wavelengths. Bacteriophage MS2 was more sensitive than Adenovirus type 41 to UV treatment. Adenovirus type 41 was resistant to UV light at 254 nm and its inactivation required a much higher dose, 225 mJ/cm 2 [61] . The addition of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) as a photocatalyst to UV-A light increased its antimicrobial efficacy against the murine norovirus, a surrogate of the human norovirus, while UV-B alone was effective in inactivating murine norovirus activity. Although a reduction in infectious viral particles was observed, there were no significant changes observed in viral nucleic acids, indicating that the effect on other components, including proteins, in such viruses [67] . Although UV-LEDs emitting 285 nm light showed promising viral inactivation [93] more extensive research at different wavelengths is needed.",

Isochrysis galbana is food for several bivalve larvae and has been studied for biomass and lipid production in a two-phase system by Che et al. [18] . The authors used a 50:50 ratio of blue (465 nm) and red (640 nm) LEDs in the first phase for biomass culture and a green (520 nm) LED in the second phase for lipid production. Maximum biomass and lipid content were obtained at a light intensity of 400 \u03bcmol/m 2 /s and a photoperiod of 18.6 h L/D (light/dark) cycle. Hun et al. [44] also observed that a combination of blue and red LEDs improved biomass production and photosynthetic pigments and that a green LED improved lipid production in four microalgae (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Isochrysis galbana, Nannochloropsis salina, and Nannochloropsis oceanica). In a three phase culture study of Nannochloropsis oceanica, a blue LED (465 nm) was used in the first phase to study the microalgal growth parameters, a green LED (550 nm) was used in the second phase for lipid production, and temperature stress was used in the third phase to increase the production of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids [116] . The synergistic effects of combined blue and red LEDs for biomass production, and combined blue, red, and green LEDs for lipid production have been established. However, the antimicrobial efficacy of combining multiple wavelengths in areas other than food and water disinfection needs more attention. LEDs emitting light in the UV range are replacing mercury lamps in curing applications, while red, blue, and green LEDs are frequently applied in biodiesel production and algaculture.",

Therefore, the experimental design must consider the LED antimicrobial efficacy, particularly when targeting solid/liquid foods.

The use of a combination of LEDs emitting light at different wavelengths can improve the antimicrobial effect. For instance, UV-C induces pyrimidine dimer formation and UV-A delays the DNA repair mechanism of microorganisms, and can also kill microorganisms by inflicting oxidative damage [21, 74] . The use of chlorine with a UV-LED improved the inactivation rate of B. subtilis spores by approximately two-fold compared to the use of the UV-LED alone [71] .

UV-C LEDs are the most commonly utilized to disinfect water, but their low power output, low energy conversion efficiency, and high cost has hindered a largescale adoption of UV-C LEDs. In the conversion of electrical energy to light energy, a high proportion of UV-C LED electrical energy is converted to heat, which must be immediately removed to cool down the LED junction. The heat production of LEDs during operation wears out system components and subjects the targets to damaging heat. Therefore, durable, heat resistant, cost effective LED components need to be carefully selected, and the LED system must be designed to release heat efficiently to avoid operational failure.",

Water depth plays a major role in decontamination. Longer wavelengths can penetrate deeper to achieve microbial inactivation. The turbidity of the targeted sample plays a major role in the overall efficiency of the LED treatment. Inorganic matter in a water sample absorbs the light, reducing the light available for disinfection. The particles that constitute the turbidity also shield the microorganism targets of the LED. Such factors are familiar to LED researchers and optimization studies are ongoing. The light wavelength used must provide enough energy to eliminate the LED target in spite of being inhibited by turbidity and the absorption of light by nontargeted components in the medium.",

UV-C LEDs are mainly used to kill microorganisms in water, and UV-C LED units for portable applications such as water sterilization bottles, disinfection of medical equipment, are available in the marketplace. The selection of LEDs for economical water disinfection is based on microorganism inactivation efficacy and low electrical energy consumption. Simultaneous and sequential LED treatments, utilizing different combinations of LEDs, are used to achieve maximum disinfection levels in water and foods. Microorganism species respond differently to light at different wavelengths, and more research is needed to understand this differential response, and to select the LED treatment that fits the conditions at hand. Changes in food macromolecules during LED treatments are also under continued investigation. While, LEDs could be added as an additional treatment for microbial inactivation in food products and water in the future, the important factors influencing the disinfection efficacy of LEDs emitting light with different wavelengths and the mechanisms involved need further investigation.",

The kinetics of microorganism inactivation were determined mathematically with the help of LED energy response curves at different wavelengths using a multitarget model. The inactivation profile of each species showed either a linear or sigmoidal survival curve. LED treatments were more efficient than LPUV treatment for the inactivation of P. aeruginosa, L. pneumophila, and surrogate microorganisms in water. The 265 nm LED exhibited the most effective energy efficacy based on the inactivation rate constant of all the tested microorganisms except for E. coli. The 280 nm LED treatment consumed the least electrical energy to obtain a 3 log reduction of the microorganisms tested (0.15-1.11 kWh/m 3 ) compared to 265 and 300 nm LEDs (0.24-17.4 kWh/m 3 )[107].",
