All vaccines can be classified into different types, such as vaccines against infectious diseases, anticancer vaccines and vaccines against autoimmune diseases. In recent decades, recombinant technologies have enabled the design of experimental vaccines against a wide range of diseases using plant viruses and virus-like particles as central elements to stimulate protective and long-lasting immune responses. The analysis of recent publications shows that at least 97 experimental vaccines have been constructed based on plant viruses, including 71 vaccines against infectious agents, 16 anticancer vaccines and 10 therapeutic vaccines against autoimmune disorders. Several plant viruses have already been used for the development of vaccine platforms and have been tested in human and veterinary studies, suggesting that plant virus-based vaccines will be introduced into clinical and veterinary practice in the near future.",

The application of increased temperatures viruses are assembled from single or a few CP molecules and demonstrate remarkable structural flexibility, allowing different manipulations, such as disassembly/reassembly, as well as chemical and genetic modifications. This enables the rational design of vaccines and the introduction of different antigens derived from infectious agents, allergens and self-molecules. Additionally, plant VLPs and other artificially generated VLPs do not contain replicating nucleic acids. This prevents the reversion of vaccines into infectious viruses, which is a serious risk factor for attenuated viral vaccines. From a technological viewpoint, plant viruses and VLPs can be produced in different recombinant hosts (bacteria, yeasts, plants, and eukaryotic cells) under cGMP conditions; the mentioned structural flexibility of plant viruses allows the construction of universal vaccine platforms [25, 26] .

Peptide vaccines can stimulate the formation of neutralizing antibodies and ensure protection against the corresponding pathogen in animal models (Suppl. Table S2 ). The advantages of this approach include the reduced influence of short peptides on the structural integrity of viral carriers and the easy production of experimental vaccines. However, the antigen is frequently not a linear AA sequence but a spatially complex structure involving different parts of the antigenic protein. For such antigens, peptide-based vaccines are not suitable for stimulating protection via the immune response. Therefore, several authors have suggested the usage of whole proteins as antigens, which can result in epitope structures closely related to native ones and elicit neutralizing antibodies after immunizations. Genetic fusions of whole antigenic proteins with viral CPs negatively influence VLP formation in most cases. However, sometimes plant viral coats are able to accommodate even very long antigenic sequences on their surfaces [40, 41] . As alternatives to genetic fusions, other approaches can result in antigen presentation, such as chemical coupling or physical binding of the antigen to the VLP surface using binding partner molecules. Successful examples of the generation of vaccines using the chemical or enzymatic coupling of whole antigens include studies of experimental vaccines against Francisella tularensis [42] , influenza [43] , Yersinia pestis [44] , Plasmodium vivax [45] , and Zika virus [46] .",

Introduction of the chimeric gene into the TMV-based plant vector and transient expression in spinach leaves resulted in AlMV-like particles exposing rabies epitopes. The inclusion of raw spinach leaves containing these VLPs in the diet of human volunteers led to significant antibody responses to rabies virus and plant virus carriers [48, 49] .

The vaccine was designed based on Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) VLPs with chemically coupled TRAP antigen that were formulated with microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT) as an adjuvant. Vaccine formulations containing VLPs increased antibody production against TRAP compared to that produced by the antigen alone. The VLP-based vaccine formulated with MCT conferred significant protection in the challenge test with recombinant P. berghei, suggesting that MCT can be used as an advantageous adjuvant alternative for prophylactic VLP vaccines [45] .",

Today, there are 26 licensed inactivated vaccines, some of which are produced routinely. However, existing vaccines do not ensure complete protection against the circulating influenza strains [54] . The reasons for low vaccine efficacy are the low levels of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and influenza strain variations in the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence. For the improvement of flu vaccines, the use of stronger adjuvants and increased amounts of HA as well as the addition of new antigens (neuraminidase and matrix protein M2e) to influenza vaccines should increase efficacy [39] . Supplementary  Table S2 ). One experimental vaccine is currently being tested in a human trial that aims to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) VLPs as adjuvants for use in a seasonal flu trivalent vaccine in 48 healthy volunteers [55] . The efficacy of the plant VLP-adjuvanted flu vaccine has not yet been reported. Earlier publications suggest that filamentous PapMV VLPs containing a consensus peptide of the influenza matrix M2e protein increase the survival of immunized mice if used as an adjuvant together with a trivalent inactivated flu vaccine. These results demonstrate the strong adjuvanting properties of filamentous plant VLPs for influenza vaccines [56] .",

His therapy method resulted in the cure of more than 1000 patients. However, the method was later replaced with radiation and chemotherapy due to dangerous infection risks and the absence of reproducible results. The next important milestone in the development of cancer immunotherapy was the finding of Old et al. in 1959, which demonstrated the antitumor activity of the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG) in a mouse model.

Sequential use of these vaccines reduced the immune responses against VLP carriers and improved the formation of antibodies against the HER2 peptide. This suggested prime-boost strategy considerably reduced tumor development and enhanced the survival rate in a mouse tumor model. The study clearly demonstrated that the Th1-type immune response, including the formation of IgG2a antibodies, the secretion of IFNg and the activation of CD4+/CD8+ T-cells, is the most important factor for immunotherapy. Interestingly, plant VLPs derived from CPMV demonstrated better immunotherapeutic properties than those derived from Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV).

The results suggest the superior immune-stimulating properties of CPMV compared with those of other structural variants of TMV and confirm that antigen multiplicity is one of the most important factors involved in eliciting a strong immune response. One possible explanation for the enhanced immune-stimulating properties of CPMV in a mouse melanoma model is the ability of VLPs to recruit monocytes into the tumor microenvironment, leading to the infiltration of neutrophils and natural killer cells and resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Authors suggest that the intrinsic properties of some plant viruses allow them to be developed as cancer vaccines for clinical use; however, the detailed mechanisms of immune stimulation remain to be elucidated [71] .",

One of them is the time required to bring a new vaccine from the development phase to the market, which can exceed 15 years, including 7 years on average for the design, construction, validation and commencement of industrial manufacture. The next factor is the significant human and financial resources necessary for the development and sustainable on-demand production of vaccines. The vaccine industry has to continuously solve problems, such as long life cycles of vaccines, high facility costs and the complexity of global vaccine demand [92, 93] . Long vaccine development periods are an additional challenge negatively influencing the availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, Zika virus, Chickungunja virus and others [94] . Moreover, the chosen antigen structure used for vaccine manufacturing can be different from the corresponding native antigen, reducing or even preventing the neutralizing ability of the generated antibodies. This aspect critically influences the development process of vaccines against pathogens, especially against infectious agents with high genetic variation. HIV is an example of such a pathogen, against which there is no effective vaccine despite many years of effort by academic scientists and the vaccine industry [95] . One other challenging aspect that should be mentioned here as a factor that is possibly important for vaccine development in the future is the fact that the latest studies suggest that the microbiome in the digestive track of recipients can influence the efficacy of vaccines. The effect is observed both in humans and in laboratory mice, suggesting the need for further investigation [96] .",

When compared with other VLPs, plant VLP-based vaccines have additional advantages, such as flexibility in vaccine construction, the ease of VLP production and purification, stability and the low risk of preexisting immunity. All these properties make plant viruses an attractive alternative to animal and human VLPs.",

However, several vaccine platforms have been developed that allow the construction of new vaccines in a comparably short period of time. Some experimental vaccine platforms tolerate the incorporation of large antigens and even full-sized proteins in viral structures without influencing the particle morphology and immune-stimulating properties. As the native spatial structures of recombinant antigens are highly important for eliciting antibodies with neutralizing activity and long-lasting immunity [97, 98] , future recombinant VLP vaccines must contain multiple copies of correctly folded antigens as well as different immunostimulating components, including T-cell epitopes and nucleic acids.",
