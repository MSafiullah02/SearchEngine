The novel coronavirus was identified on January 6, 2020 and was termed as 2019-nCoV (3); the virus was speculated to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan. As of February 25, 2020, widespread human-to-human transmission has resulted in 80239 cases in 26 countries, with 2701 deaths (4). To date, there have been few reports on chest computed tomography (CT) findings of complications arising from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. We reviewed a case of COVID-19 pneumonia with mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax.",

The most common CT finding in COVID-19 pneumonia is GGO in the subpleural regions of the lower lobes (5). These findings are mainly seen in the early stages of COVID-19 pneumonia and may be attributed to alveolar swelling, a small amount of exudation in the alveolar space, and alveolar septal inflammation caused by infection (6). Some cases respond poorly to treatment, and localized lung lesions progress to multiple and diffuse lesions.",

Serial follow-up chest CT showed the progression of the pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with a lower lung predominance. The patient did not have a history of pneumothorax or any underlying pulmonary disease; no abnormalities, such as a small bulla or emphysema, were observed in the initial CT scan. The patient had no history of smoking. As a result of diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the alveoli may be prone to rupturing. Furthermore, the patient developed a pronounced cough, which may also induce alveolar rupture. Mediastinal emphysema results from a sudden increase in the alveolar pressure, causing alveolar rupture and air leakage with interstitial emphysema (7); this can be observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (8). In addition to the giant bulla, chest CT also revealed multiple bullae in the subpleural lung zones (arrowheads; Fig. 2C, E), where pneumonic consolidation was more prominent than in the contralateral areas, which could easily rupture and cause pneumothorax. While mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax are well-known complications of mechanical ventilation, the patient only received HFNC oxygen therapy before the emphysema occurred. Therefore, in this particular case, we speculate that the mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax may be related to COVID-19 pneumonia.",
