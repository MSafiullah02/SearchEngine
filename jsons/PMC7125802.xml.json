Diagnostic reasoning is the process of reconstructing the past facts from the observed evidence. Treatment planning is reasoning about the effects of actions treated on patients [1]. Usually, the practice of medicine requires both kinds of reasoning to work simultaneously. However, few current reasoning methods can conduct the two reasoning tasks successfully at one time. Besides, the reasoning systems become more complex when considering the complexity of human bodies and its relationships with the environmental factors.",

Therefore, the site-by-site factors and clinicians\u2019 knowledge, which may be expressed as extra constraints in the reasoning systems, need to be integrated into the medical decision support systems. At the same time, owing to the difficulties to estimate the causal effects between possible pathogens and the diseases, the parameters of the knowledge base can be expressed as fuzzy numbers.",

First, the conditional probabilities between a node and its parent or children nodes could be fuzzy instead of a crisp numbers, due to the difficulties of learning accurately the cause\u2013effect relationships among the nodes [14]. Second, as a common fact, the experts may have some professional speculations in the form of constraints when reasoning from a Bayesian network or an influence diagram. These constraints could be boundary, dependency, or disjunctive conditions. Third, the investigators of influence diagrams used to maximize the utility functions by node removal processes [11], [12], [13] and ignore diagnostic reasoning tasks. Oppositely, Bayesian networks have been used widely in probabilistic reasoning but lacked the capability to suggest the optimal decision [2], [3], [8], [9], [10].",

The input information of the reasoning system are conditional probability distributions of the network model, the costs of the candidate antibiotic treatments, the expected effects of the treatments, and extra constraints regarding belief propagation. Since the prevalence of the pathogens and infections are determined by many site-by-site factors, the decisions involve uncertainty not compliant with conventional approaches. So, we allow the decisions to be made under fuzzy contexts, at which some of the parameters could be fuzzy parameters [14], and some constraints regarding diagnosis are introduced. When a patient is received, this reasoning system can, based on the present symptoms or bacteriological tests, help the clinician make precise diagnosis at the first decision point, and also supply the suggestions of optimal treatment for the infection. The outputs of the reasoning model are the likelihood of a bacterial infection, the most likely pathogen(s), the suggestion for the optimal treatment, the gain of life expectancy of the patient related to the optimal treatment, the probability of coverage associated with the antibiotic treatment, and the cost-effect analysis of the treatment prescribed.

As depicted in Fig. 2\n, this example uses an influence diagram as the knowledge and decision model where the conditional probability distributions for the relevant random and decision variables are calculated. For the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality, all random nodes are assumed binary. The conditional probability distributions of the variables are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3. The nodes and their states in Fig. 2 are described as follows.\u2022\nPathogen (Pathoi): A microorganism capable of causing urinary tract infection. For the convenience of illustration, only 3 of 12 pathogens are presented: Patho1 (Klebsiella pneumoniae), Patho2 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Patho3 (Escherichia coli). The states of this kind of nodes are severity: severe (Pathoi\n = 1) and not severe (Pathoi\n = 0).\u2022\nUrinary tract infection (UTI): The states of this node are infected (UTI = 1) and not infected (UTI = 0).\u2022\nSigns and symptoms of urinary tract infection (Signi): The manifestations that might cause from UTI. There are six possible signs presented in Fig. 2: Sign1 (suprapubic pain), Sign2 (frequent micturition), Sign3 (flank pain), Sign4 (urinary symptoms), Sign5 (serum albumin) and Sign6 (fever). The states of these nodes are present (Signi\n = 1) and absent (Signi\n = 0).\u2022\nBacteriological tests (Testi): Test1 (growth of microorganisms in the blood), Test2 (growth of microorganisms in the urine) and Test3 (nitrite test). The states of these nodes are positive (Testi\n = 1) and negative (Testi\n = 0).\u2022\nCoverage of UTI (Coverage): The percent of pathogens of UTI susceptible to an antibiotic drug. The states of this node are covered (Coverage = 1) and not covered (Coverage = 0).\u2022\nResistance to antibiotic drugs (Resist): The states of this node are resistant (Resist = 1) and not resistant (Resist = 0).\u2022\nAntibiotic treatment (Tr): The treatment will be appropriate if it matches the in-vitro susceptibility of the pathogens. For simplicity of demonstration, we consider 5 of 26 antibiotic drugs and one additional state for no treatment. Thus, we have six alternatives, that is Tr = {tr0, tr1, tr2, tr3, tr4, tr5}, where tr0 stands for no treatment and tri\n = 0 or 1. When tri\n = 1, it means that tri is prescribed; oppositely, tri\n = 0 means that tri is not prescribed. For the efficiency of computation, we allow only one antibiotic drug at one time, which let it possible to formulate this decision problem as a mixed 0\u20131 integer program. If more than one drug is mixed in the therapy, the mixed treatment will be regarded as another treatment. Notably, this node is a decision node that has effects on the coverage from urinary tract infection.\u2022\nUnderlying (Underlying): The underlying disorder of the patient, which will be represented by an equivalent base years of the remaining life in this illustrative example.\u2022\nCost (Cost(tri)): A utility node associated with antibiotic treatments.\u2022\nGain (Gain): The gain in life expectancy obtained by prescribing an antibiotic drug, which is a function of the coverage (Coverage) and the underlying disorder of the patient (Underlying).\n",

First, as the clinical problems grow larger and more complex, it may be a burden for the clinicians to formulate the model. In some diseases, there may be tens or hundreds of nodes in the networks. The clinicians will have difficulties to estimate the parameters or specify the conditions of their diagnosis and prescription. Therefore, the system needs some experts in knowledge engineering or information management to participate in, which consequently increases the costs to implement. Second, as the scales of network grow larger, belief propagation will be more complicated and time-consuming. Some special techniques for belief propagation may be considered, such as clustering, joint tree decomposition, stochastic simulation, and so on [2], [3], [7], [8], [9], [10]. How to integrate these propagation methods and the optimization model will be a critical issue in implementing the reasoning system. Third, as network structures become huge, implementing the optimization model with LINGO will be fairly challenging. LINGO provides several interfaces with other applications, such as Visual C++, Visual Java, Visual Basic, etc. The system developers can bundle LINGO's functionality into their applications, or call functions from within the LINGO models that were written in an external programming language [21]. It will facilitate generating the codes for LINGO models and importing the input data from other applications.",
