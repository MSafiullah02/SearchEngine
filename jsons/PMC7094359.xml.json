The individual clinical diagnosis was based on the clinical diagnosis standard for SARS patients issued by Ministry of Chinese Public Health. All patients studied met the specified criteria for discharge.3 The first follow-up visits for these patients were from July 1, 2003, to August 10, 2003. Although most of these rehabilitating SARS patients were well enough to perform their daily activities in the follow-up study, they complained of limited physical ability from general weakness and/or shortness of breath during the clinical follow-up. Being an entirely new entity, there was no literature to reference for guidance about the course of SARS; therefore, we relied only on performing follow-up pulmonary function testing, frontal chest radiography (CXR), and/or high-resolution CT, and serum SARS-CoV IgG antibody examination in Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing.",

Three nonblinded radiologists with a viewing console assessed all CXR and CT images, with the final conclusions established by consensus. Each segment of the lung was reviewed for ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion. Abnormalities were magnified by using a zoom function and were examined for intralobular interstitial, interlobular septal, or peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. The presence or absence of nodules or masses, cavitation or calcification, and emphysema was also noted. The presence of parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces (bronchovascular, pleural, or mediastinal), thickened interstitium, and traction bronchiectasis were evidence of fibrotic changes.4\n",

The wells with polystyrene microplate strips were coated with two recombinant SARS-CoV antigens that are well characterized. The serum was diluted in diluent buffer (1:10), incubated in the coated wells for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and the wells were washed five times with washing buffer. The enzyme-labeled antihuman IgG working dilution (100 \u03bcL) was added, incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, and washed five times with washing buffer. A tetramethyl-benzidine substrate was then added to each well. The presence of specific antibodies was indicated by the presence of a yellow color after substrate addition. Reaction was terminated by addition of hydrochloric acid. The intensity of the color was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in proportion to the amount of antibodies in the specimen. The optical density (OD) obtained on the y-axis was plotted against the lot-specific standard concentrations on the x-axis, resulting in a linear calibration curve. The OD values of the positive control and negative control were calculated. The cut-off value for IgG was 0.18, which was calculated as the mean + 2 SD of the readings given by 1,000 blood donor control sera. If the OD value was above the cut-off value, it indicated a positive result for SARS-CoV IgG.5\n",

            "text": "During follow-up visits, we found that the rehabilitating SARS patients did not express persistence of SARS virus infection, as detected by SARS-CoV RNA examination, and the results showed that the rehabilitating patients did not have infectivity. In our study, 50 of 258 patients (19.4%) showed negative SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in at least two examinations, hinting that they might have been misdiagnosed. Both the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard (2003)3 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS case definition (2003)9 emphasize the importance of epidemiologic history, clinical manifestation, and CXR changes on clinically diagnosed SARS disease. In the laboratory test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS case definition especially emphasizes the importance on confirming SARS through detecting the dynamic changes of titrations of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV and positive detection of SARS-CoV RNA by PCR, but the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard does not mentioned the importance of laboratory SARS-CoV testing in SARS case confirmation. This might cause the existence of misdiagnosed SARS cases. Therefore, in the retrospective and follow-up study, we excluded these cases to ensure data accuracy. In our study, we found that there were 53 of 208 patients (25.5%) whose SARS-CoV IgG antibody results positive and also had a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco < 80% predicted). Analyzing the results of the second pulmonary function examination and comparing them to the results of the first showed that most of these patients (41 of 51 patients, 80.4%) had improved pulmonary diffusion function (p = 0.0003). Of the rehabilitating patients with pulmonary radiologic residue caused by SARS disease presenting as pulmonary fibrotic changes, 22 of 40 patients (55%) showed improvement on the HRCT scan in a month. This suggests that the mechanism of lung injury and lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS-CoV might have a different pathophysiologic process as compared to other diseases in the lung. SARS patients with lung fibrotic changes seem to have the ability of self-rehabilitation, and a pulmonary diffusion test might be more sensitive than HRCT on evaluating lung fibrotic changes (80.4% vs 55%). We think that the radiologic resolution of pneumonic process may lag behind the clinical picture. Although this study was limited to only approximately a 2-month follow-up, the lung function test reflected an earlier resolution of diffusion impairments compared with HRCT.",

The duration of fever, dosage of glucocorticoid usage, fraction of inspired oxygen, and number of NIPPV treatments in the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco < 80% predicted were also longer. This may explain why older SARS patients had more severe symptoms than the younger patients. In spite of more aggressive therapy methods, the sequelae rates in the older rehabilitating SARS patients presented higher rates of lung fibrotic changes.10\n11\n",
