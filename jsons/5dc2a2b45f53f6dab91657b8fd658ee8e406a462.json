            "text": "COVID-19 has become a serious health problem all around the world. It is confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19 cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network can achieve in real circumstances. The average accuracy of the proposed network for detecting COVID-19 cases is 99.56%, and the overall average accuracy for all classes is 91.4%.",

So far, the coronavirus has infected at least 1.9 million people and killed around 126,607 patients [14] . Due to the high transmissibility of coronavirus, the detection of coronavirus disease-19 plays an essential role in how to control and plan to prevent COVID- 19 [24] . On the other hand, the lack of detective tools and the limitations in medical equipment and experts has slowed down the disease detection. As a result, it increases the number of patients and casualties. If the disease is detected quickly, its prevalence and the number of casualties due to COVID-19 disease will decrease.",

It can be understood from the confusion matrixes and the tables that the concatenated network performs better in detecting COVID-19 and not detecting false cases of COVID-19 and outputs better accuracy overall. The reason the precision of COVID-19 class is low is that in our work, despite some other researches that worked on detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images, we tested our neural nets on a massive number of images. Our test images were much more than our train images. As it is explained above, because we had only 31 cases of COVID-19 and 11271 cases from other two classes, the false positives of the COVID-19 class would become more than true positives, e.g., the concatenated network in the first fold, detected 26 cases correctly out of 31 COVID-19 cases and from 11271 other cases, only mistakenly detects 68 cases as COVID-19. If we had equal samples from COVID-19 class as the other classes, the precision would become a high value, but because having few COVID-19 cases and lots of other cases for validation, the precision would become a low value. We could have tested our network on a few cases like some of the other researches done recently, but we wanted to show the real performance of our network with few COVID-19 cases. As mentioned, mistakenly detecting 68 cases from 11271 cases to be infected to COVID-19 is not very much but not very well also, and we hope that by using much-provided data from patients infected, COVID-19, the detection accuracy will rise much more.",

We used two open-source datasets that contained 180 and 6054 images from patients infected to COVID-19 and pneumonia, respectively, and 8851 images from normal people. Although we had a few images of COVID-19 class, we selected 633 images for training in each phase, so that our network learn COVID-19 class characteristics better, not only the other two classes. We considered eight phases for the training process, which in every phase the images from normal and pneumonia classes were different so that the network can distinguish COVID-19 from other classes better. In total out training set included 3783 images, and The rest of the images were chosen for evaluating the network. We tried to test our model on a large number of images so that our real achieved accuracy be clear to everyone. We achieved an average accuracy of 99.56%, and 80.53% recall for the COVID-19 class, and the overall accuracy equal to 91.4% between five folds. We hope that our trained network that is available for the public comes with the help of medical diagnosis. We also hope that in the future, larger datasets from COVID-19 patients become available, and by using them, the accuracy of our network increases for good.
