            "text": "To determine if the SARS-CoV S protein could be expressed from a VSV recombinant, we first generated a cDNA clone of the SARS S gene by reverse transcription and PCR amplification of RNA purified from SARS-CoV-infected cells. We next constructed a plasmid with the SARS-CoV S coding sequence inserted between the VSV G and VSV L genes (Fig. 1A). Appropriate VSV transcription start and stop sites flanked the S gene. We recovered a recombinant VSV (designated VSV-S) from this plasmid using published methods (Lawson et al., 1995). To determine if the recombinant virus expressed the SARS S protein, we infected BHK cells with the recovered virus or with wt VSV and metabolically labeled cells for 1 h with [35S]-methionine. Lysates of radiolabeled cells were then analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE. Since VSV shuts off host protein synthesis, wt VSV-infected cells express predominantly the five viral proteins L, G, N, P, and M. VSV-S-infected cells expressed the five VSV proteins (Fig. 1B), and also a protein of the expected size for S (calculated as \u223c197 kDa assuming N-glycosylation at all 23 potential sites). To verify the identity of the S protein, S was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the S cytoplasmic domain. The immunoprecipitated protein appeared as two bands (Fig. 1C, lane 1), potentially representing two different glycosylation states of S. To examine this possibility we treated the protein with PNGase F (Fig. 1C, lane 2), which cleaves all N-linked glycans. PNGase F-digestion yielded a single band of approximately 156 kDa, confirming that variable glycosylation states of the S protein were responsible for the observed size heterogeneity. Digestion of immunoprecipitated S protein with Endo H, an endoglycosidase that cleaves only unprocessed or partially processed glycans from proteins, yielded two bands (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The Endo-H-resistant band of original size accounted for \u223c15% of total S protein. The lower band, representing protein which had not yet undergone processing of its carbohydrate side chains, accounted for \u223c85% of total S protein. In a pulse-chase experiment with a 20-min pulse labeling, we observed that 50% of S expressed by VSV was Endo H resistant within 30 min after the chase was begun (data not shown). From these experiments, we concluded that the S protein is transported through the exocytic pathway at least as far as the Golgi apparatus where Endo H resistance is acquired.",

Viral titers in the nasal turbinates were slightly above the limit of detection for both VSV-S (3 of 4 mice)- and SARS-CoV (2 of 4 mice)-immunized mice.

Mice were bled 24 h after administration of antisera and SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody titers were measured. Mice were subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV, and 2 days later lungs were collected and SARS-CoV titers were determined. SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody titers were detectable in the groups of mice that received VSV-S antisera and SARS-CoV antisera (diluted 1:10). Only these mice were able to protect against SARS-CoV infection upon challenge.

Although passive transfer of immune sera demonstrated that antibody induced by either VSV-S or SARS-CoV inoculations is sufficient to prevent SARS-CoV infection, cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection. Similarly, it has been shown with other coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus type 3, that antibody-mediated immunity is sufficient for protection (Pope et al., 1996). Furthermore, the complete protection from SARS viral replication in the lower respiratory tissues of VSV-S-immunized mice observed when challenge was administered 4 months post-immunization suggests that prolonged protection may be provided from a single immunization with VSV-S. Ours is the first study to show such long-term protection after immunization with an experimental SARS-CoV vaccine. In previous studies on vaccination of mice with VSV expressing an influenza hemagglutinin, we found that protective influenza-neutralizing antibody titers were very long-lived, declining only 2- to 4-fold over the course of more than one year (Roberts and Rose, unpublished data).",

Pre-existing immunity to VSV is rare in the human population. Effectiveness of other vaccine candidates based on adenovirus or parainfluenza virus could be limited by a high prevalence of pre-existing immunity to the vectors in the human population. Vaccines based on modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) could face the same problem because the parental vaccinia virus has been used worldwide as the smallpox vaccine, and there is extensive immunity to vaccinia, especially in the older population most susceptible to SARS (Crotty et al., 2003). DNA vaccines have been effective, especially in small animal models; however, efficacy in humans has yet to be demonstrated. VSV has the additional advantages of growing to very high titers in cell lines such as Vero that are approved for human vaccine production. VSV is also effective at very low doses (Roberts et al., 1998, Roberts et al., 1999) and is effective as an intranasal vaccine (Egan et al., 2004).",

Based on this calculation, we estimate that at least 17 of the 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites are used (assuming 2.5 kDa per N-linked glycan). We also demonstrated that S expressed from the VSV recombinant moves to the Golgi apparatus where it acquires Endo H resistance. About 15% of S expressed during a 1-h labeling period contained Endo-H-resistant glycans. In a pulse-chase experiment with a 20-min pulse labeling, we observed that 50% of S expressed by VSV was Endo H resistant within 30 min after the chase was begun (data not shown). Finally, we readily observed S protein on the cell surface. Our results indicate that S protein moves efficiently through the exocytic pathway when it is expressed in the absence of other SARS virus proteins. Exposure of S protein on the cell surface of infected cells is likely to be important in the induction of a neutralizing antibody response.",

In contrast, vaccine against feline infectious peritonitis virus using the S protein of that virus as an antigen enhanced disease in cats (Vennema et al., 1990). No such enhancement of infection was observed in the present mouse model in this and previous studies. However, since SARS-CoV does not cause a disease in mice, this model may not reveal such effects. Mild to moderate hepatic lesions have been observed in a single set of experiments where ferrets were vaccinated with MVA, MVA-SAR-S, or MVA-SARS-N and challenged with SARS-CoV (Czub et al., 2005, Weingartl et al., 2004). The significance of these lesions is unclear since they occur in MVA vaccinated, SARS-CoV-challenged animals, as well as unvaccinated (PBS controls) SARS-CoV challenged animals. Although two of three ferrets receiving MVA-SAR-S vaccine have slightly larger lesions following SARS-CoV challenge, it is difficult to ascertain whether hepatic disease is enhanced or just variable. Furthermore, SARS-CoV disease is primarily a respiratory disease, and the lesions in the liver may have little or no relevance to SARS-CoV disease. These observations may therefore be isolated to the use of this vector or this animal model or the specific combination. The potential for SARS-CoV-enhanced disease in previously vaccinated or SARS-exposed animals requires further studies in models that more closely mimic the human disease.",
