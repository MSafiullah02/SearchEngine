Recently these methods have been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic to determine the basic reproduction number [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , the incubation period [12] [13] [14] and to describe the dynamics of the pandemic [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In this framework there is no natural and transparent way to account for the delay occurring due to the incubation period of the disease. Even after refinements to try to account for some aspects of this delay [15] [16] [17] 23] , these models are still plagued by uncontrolled approximations. We suggest that models based on differential equations should not be used, they should be replaced with ones based on an integral equation, which provides a natural setting to implement the time delay. The approach we present is not new, it was already implicit in the original Kermack-McKendric theory proposed in 1927 [24] . Even though several variants of that model with various degrees of precision circulate in the current literature [25] [26] [27] [28] , their superiority over the differential equation based method has not been widely recognized.",

We demonstrate this by comparing how the two types of approach describe the New York City data [29] , taken from the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, we show that even in the initial simple exponential phase of the epidemic, the correct, integral equation based model can give a vastly larger estimate for R 0 , the basic reproduction rate. Secondly, we show that the oscillations in the graph of the number of newly infected people after restrictive public interaction measures were introduced, is well described by the integral equation model. This is a generic feature of COVID-19 data, seen in several countries, and there is no simple way the differential equation based models could explain it.",

We cannot take on the task of performing a similar comparison for all the models currently accepted by the community, but we urge everyone to test how different their results are between the two approaches in the case of the particular models they use.

The generalization to include S as a dynamical parameter, to consider births and deaths or other parameters is straightforward. With this approximation the two functions describing the dynamics are E(t) and I(t). At this point it is instructive to introduce t e and and t i , the average people who were exposed between today and t e = 4 days ago. The red area represents those that are infectious, i.e. people who were exposed more than t e days ago, but not more than t e + t i = 7 days ago. In the SEIR model the number of people who cease to be infectious from day 11 to day 12 is equal to the daily average of the red area in the top panel. In reality, however, only people in the leftmost red histogram, here a much smaller number, cease to be infectious. Similarly, in the SEIR model the number of people who become infectious is the daily average of the blue area, when in reality it is only people in the leftmost bar of the blue area who become infectious from day 11 to day 12. Clearly the only case when the SEIR model correctly represents the situation is when the number of newly infected people per day is constant in time.",

The most important goal of the first restrictive measures was to decrease the value of R 0 as fast as possible and bring it below the critical value of 1. In the following we study how the different models react to a sudden decrease of R 0 and compare them qualitatively to the daily reported new cases in New York City [29] . To simplify our discussion we will assume that all cases are reported exactly after the incubation period, i.e. The value of R 0 was instantaneously decreased to 0.95 in both cases on day 73. The difference between the two models is quite dramatic. The SEIR solution reacts immediately and turns smoothly to a decreasing exponential function. The solution of the integral equation is qualitatively different. There is a delay of t e + t i after which the effect of the lockdown becomes visible, then an oscillation follows. The characteristic scales of this oscillation are indicated in the figure. Right: time evolution of the new reported cases after a gradual lockdown from day 71 to day 74 confronted with the data of New York City. The initial parameters are the same as for the left panel. R 0 is now decreased to 0.95 linearly in time during this four day period in both models. The main features of the curves are similar to the left panel but the amplitude of the oscillation is reduced, making it similar to the real data. Note that we did not fit our model to the data. This plot is an illustration that the main features (delay and oscillation) of the data are well captured by the integral equation and neither of these is reproduced by SEIR. t e + t i time after first exposure. In the case of the SEIR model the rate of people leaving the incubation phase is dR/dt = \u03b3I while in the case of the integral equation it is \u03c1(t \u2212 t e \u2212 t i ). These two functions will be referred to as \"reported new cases\" in the following. If we assume that the majority of cases are reported when symptoms emerge, it follows that any change in the parameters will only show up t e + t i days later in the data. Any reasonable model should be able to naturally account for this delay. Quantities in differential equations react immediately to any change of the parameters, thus no differential equation based model (such as SEIR or its simple extensions) is expected to explain such a delay. The integral equation (4), on the other hand, naturally provides a delay.",

Correcting the data for this effect later would weaken but not eliminate the observed oscillation, it seems to be a real effect.
