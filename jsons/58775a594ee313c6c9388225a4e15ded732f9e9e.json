A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus. (IPVYQVNNLEEICQLIIQAF).

The existence of such epitopes makes a range of preclinical vaccine experiments possible without having to rely on non-human pri- 35 mates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson et al. showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) [73] . Wilson We set out to see if we could drive CTL expansion directed against NP43-53 to occur after vaccinating C57BL/6 mice with Ebola Zaire NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC), and to subsequently conduct an in-vivo EBOV challenge study to see if this pep-50 tide was protective.",

Microspheres 85 containing NP43-53 and CpG were prepared as a dry powder formulation and suspended before use in a PBS injectate solution containing MPLA, and administered intradermally via injection at the base of the tail into mice as described in a previous publication [48] . As illustrated in Figure 1c , there was no statistically significant difference between the ELISPOT data for the vaccinated mice 90 versus the response seen in the negative ELISPOT controls.",

We hypothesized that the NP43-53 epitope was inefficiently processed into MHC binding sub-sequences during antigen presentation. In order to explore possible H2-D b matches for peptide sequences 95 contained within Ebola Zaire NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC), we prepared three peptide vaccine formulations, each containing one of the three possible 9mer sub-sequences within NP43-53. These sequences are shown in Table 1 . We then vaccinated, via intradermal (tail) injection, three groups of mice with microspheres containing one of the three 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53 (6 per 100 group). ELISPOT analysis was performed, stimulating harvested splenocytes with the three possible 9mer sub-sequences. Splenocytes from mice receiving the NP44-52 sub-sequence had a statistically higher ELISPOT response than mice vaccinated with the other two possible sub-sequence 9mers (P < 0.0001) as shown in Figure 1a . This is consistent with the predicted H2-D b binding 105 affinity of YQVNNLEEI as shown in Supplementary Material . This peptide has a predicted favorable H2-I b binding affinity as shown in Supplementary Material Table 5 .",

It has been suggested that EBOV can mediate an innate immunity response through stimulation of TLR-4 [33] . Because the adjuvanted microsphere vaccine used in this experiment incorporates a TLR-4 agonist, we dosed 10 mice with adjuvanted microspheres without peptides and found the level of protection after exposure to 100 PFU EBOV to be statistically no different from that seen in PBS buffer controls (Supplementary Material Figure   1 ).

Although vaccine development has been almost exclusively focused on eliciting a humoral immune response in the host through inoculation with whole protein antigen [51][69][59][29], CTL peptide 5 vaccines producing a T-cell response may offer an important alternative approach [23]. For HIV and EBOV and influenza in particular, the potential of CTL vaccines has been discussed [21][7][56]. Although computational prediction alone has been used for T-cell vaccine design [2][14], we saw a unique opportunity to see if a preventative EBOV T-cell vaccine could be successfully 10 designed based on the specific epitopes targeted by survivors of documented EBOV infection. The notion of HLA restricted HIV control has been described [58]. Pereyra-Heckerman conducted an analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in individuals living with HIV [43]. They reported that HIV controllers, individuals 15 living with HIV not undergoing treatment who do not progress to AIDS, have CD8+ cells targeting different HLA restricted class I epitopes on HIV compared with progressors, individuals with HIV who progress to AIDS in the absence of therapy. Pereyra-Heckerman suggested that this observation could guide the in-silico development of a CTL vaccine for HIV and other diseases.",

            "text": "CoV-1 infection survivors have been found to have a persistent CTL response to SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid two years after infection. [42] This suggests that the same approach could be applied to SARS-CoV-2 which has conserved regions in nucleocapsid which is located within the virus (see multiple sequence alignment in Supplementary Material Figure 7 and Supplementary 305 Material Figure 8). Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite an immune response to vaccination [20]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine targeting is an important part of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coron-310 avirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection. [74] A recent paper conducted a population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes showing that the virus has evolved into two major types: L and S, with changes in their relative frequency after the outbreak possibly due to human intervention resulting in selection pressure [62]. 315 We took all possible 424 9mer peptide sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein sequences available and evaluated each peptide for HLA restriction using NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 [65][30][1]. We analyzed 9mer peptide sequences because these are often associated with superior MHC binding properties than class I peptides of other lengths [63][18]. We found 320 53 unique peptides with predicted binding below 500nM from NetMHC 4.0 and/or NetMHCpan 4.0. These results are shown in Supplementary Material",

If researchers act now during the COVID-19 outbreak, perhaps controller and progressor blood samples could be collected375    and prospectively analyzed, quickly creating a database of optimal candidate class I peptides for inclusion into a CTL vaccine with potentially broad HLA coverage for subsequent rapid manufacture and deployment. It would be interesting to see the extent to which the peptides favored by controllers appear on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, making SARS-CoV-2 a second example, across 380 two different viruses, of controllers exhibiting CTL attack preferentially on the nucleocapsid protein.",

            "text": "typically via the administration of whole protein from a pathogen. Antibody vaccines typically do not produce a robust T-cell response.[72] A T-cell vaccine is meant to elicit a cellular immune response directing CD8+ cells to expand and attack cells presenting the HLA Class I restricted pathogen-derived peptide antigen.[47] Difficulty in obtaining a reliable immune response from peptide antigens and the HLA restricted nature of CTL vaccines have limited their utility to protect individuals from infectious disease[77]. However, observations derived from individuals able to control HIV infection[43]  and EBOV infection[50]  demonstrating that control may be associated with specific CTL targeting behavior, suggest that there may be an important role for HLA-restricted peptide vaccines for protection against infectious disease for which development of an effective traditional whole protein vaccine has proved to be difficult. Theadjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform described here incorporates unmodified peptides making possible rapid manufacture and deployment to respond to a new viral threat. NP44-52 is located within one of the EBOV nucleocapsid proteins considered essential for virus replication. This epitope resides in a sequence conserved across multiple EBOV strains as shown in Supplementary Material Figure 6. A 7.3 A structure for NP and VP24 is shown for context in Figure 6a [67]. A 1.8 A resolution structure rendering for EBOV NP shown in Figure 6b illustrates that NP44-52 is a buried structural loop, which is likely to be important to the structural integrity of the EBOV NP protein [16]. This structural role of NP44-52 likely explains its conservation across EBOV strains. CTL targeting of the EBOV NP protein has been described [42][64][28] [49][24]. Nucleocapisid proteins are essential for EBOV replication [61]. Recent advances in T-cell based vaccines have focused on avoiding all variable viral epitopes and incorporating only conserved regions [7][25]. EBOV NP may be more conserved than nucleocapsid proteins VP35 and VP24 making it more suitable as a CTL vaccine target [9][73]. The nucleocapsid proteins in SARS-CoV-1 are also essential for that virus to function normally [10]. This suggests that a CTL vaccine targeting coronavirus nucleocapsid could be effective against SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. We have shown that an H2-D b restricted Class I peptide exists within the NP41-60 epitope identified by Sakebe et al. as the most commonly favored NP epitope for CD8+ attack by survivors of the 2013-1016 EBOV outbreak in WestAfrica. We have demonstrated, when delivered in conjunction with a predicted-matched Class II epitope using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform, NP44-52 protection against mortality and morbidity for the maEBOV challenge doses tested in a C57BL/6 mouse model. We accomplished this with an adjuvanted, microsphere-based, synthetic CTL peptide vaccine platform producing a protective immune response 14 days after a single administration.EBOV can cause severe pulmonary problems in exposed subjects[39]. These problems can be especially severe when the virus is delivered by aerosol[15][31].Interaction of EBOV specific antibody, NHP lung tissue and EBOV delivered to NHPs via aerosol can produce a more lethal effect than in NHPs without circulating anti-EBOV antibody exposed to aerosolized EBOV (unpublished conference presentation). This suggests that a CTL vaccine may be more effective for prophylaxis against filovirus protection than an antibody vaccine if the anticipated route of EBOV exposure is via aerosol.Sakebe et al. identified A*30:01:01 as the only HLA type common to all four survivors in their study with CD8+ targeting of NP41-60. The A*30 su-Class I peptides from epitopes targeted by controllers to broaden the HLA coverage of the vaccine. MHC binding algorithms hosted by the IEDB predict that",
