Given clinical suspicion for CAD, an exercise stress single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) with low-energy (120 kV, 30 mA) CT attenuation correction study was performed. Stress ECG and myocardial perfusion imaging were normal and CT for attenuation correction (CTAC) showed no coronary calcifications. However, the CTAC demonstrated abnormal pulmonary patchy ground glass opacities (GGOs) in the bilateral lower lobes that have been described in patients infected with novel COVID-19 infection (Figure 1).",
