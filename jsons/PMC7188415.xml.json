What they are suggesting, however, forces us to confront a long-standing tenet of our medical tradition. Namely, the primacy of the bedside clinical relationship. The relationship between clinicians and patients has long been understood to involve close contact, sometimes social, sometimes emotional, but often physical. As Osler admonished his students, \u201cMedicine is learned by the bedside and not in the classroom \u2026 See, and then reason and compare and control. But see first.\u201d (2)",

We propose that this dynamic situation calls for a parallel \u201cClinical Distancing\u201d in which we as a medical culture go against many of our fundamental instincts and, at least in the short term, begin to reduce unnecessary patient-care contacts for the benefit of our patients and our ability to continue to provide care to those who need it most.",

It is quite clear, however, that this is not the last time our health system will be threatened by large-scale epidemic or pandemic infection. It is also unclear what longer-term effects this current crisis will have on patient-clinician interactions and modes of care delivery. Emergency approval of billing for telemedicine services (13) may foreshadow a normalization of telemedicine as medicine. The longer-term impacts of the current crisis on clinical norms, which are social norms, will not be clear anytime soon (14). In the meantime, we advocate the use of clinical distancing not as a new model for care delivery, but as a targeted and extendable measure that should be escalated, and just as importantly, de-escalated when appropriate.",
