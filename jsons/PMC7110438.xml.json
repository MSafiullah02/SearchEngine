Expanding human populations and subsequent encroachment on habitats of reservoir species of zoonoses, increased trade in and ownership of \u201cexotic\u201d pets, and changes in climate will likely lead to increased exposure to zoonotic agents. Veterinarians could be held legally responsible for the transmission of zoonoses to staff or clients. Education and preventive medicine practices can be applied to reduce the risk of contracting a zoonotic disease by veterinarians, their staff, or owners of exotic pets. The health of humans, animals, and the environment are linked and must be treated as a whole to prevent the transmission of zoonoses and increase our understanding of the concept of \u201cOne Health.\u201d",

No deaths were reported, but numerous people required hospitalization. An investigation determined that exposure to African dwarf frogs (Hymenochyrus spp) was associated with infection, and the organism was isolated from animals, samples from tanks where pet frogs were housed, and breeder facilities. Similar to reptiles, amphibians can be asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella. The CDC concluded that educational material addressing Salmonella exposure from reptiles should also include amphibians as possible sources of the organism.15\n",

Zooanthroponotic pathogen (those passed from humans to animals) exposure to animals may also increase with these interactions.22 Additionally, as humans move into previously uninhabited areas, consumption of native wildlife may increase leading to increased exposure to zoonotic agents. Historically, tularemia was associated with rabbit hunting, and now Ebola virus outbreaks are associated with the bush meat trade in Africa.23 Larger human populations will require increasingly larger amounts of protein for sustenance, and some of this protein will undoubtedly come from wildlife. Finally, because of increased ease of international travel and globalization of cultures, humans, animals, and pathogens can travel the globe quickly allowing diseases to spread rapidly worldwide.24\n",

One recent study predicts that the range of Ixodes scapularis, the primary tick that transmits the etiologic agent of Lyme disease in the US, will noticeably expand in the next two decades with the predicted rate of climate change; this change in range of the vector species will also affect the geographic distribution of the disease in humans and animals, such as dogs.27 Another paper suggests that the current ranges of plague and tularemia are likely to shift north due to changes in range of host rodent species, although the changes will likely be subtle.28 Prevalence, intensity, and geographic distribution of disease due to some helminths are also expected to change with changes in climate.29 Finally, milder winters and earlier springs may lead to alterations in the typical transmission period of some vector borne diseases. For example, West Nile virus, which typically peaks in late summer, could be transmitted earlier in the year leading to a higher incidence of disease in humans earlier in the year.26 The total effects of climate change on zoonotic disease transmission and distribution is still unknown, and there are many factors that complicate predictions.26 Regardless of the specifics, alterations in disease distribution and transmission are expected as a result of changes in climate.",
