Case Presentation: Four neonatal piglets, with a history of diarrhoea were referred to the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Backweston for necropsy. They were from a fully integrated, commercial pig farm with approximately 1000 sows. Three piglets had acute, superficial, erosive and suppurative typhlocolitis and the other had mild suppurative mesocolitis. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxins A/B were detected using ELISA in the colonic contents from each piglet. C. difficile isolates from two of the piglets were PCR-ribotyped as 078 and an isolate from a third pig was ribotyped as 110.",

It has recently emerged as a major cause of porcine neonatal diarrhoea in America [1] . It has also been reported in association with neonatal diarrhoea in Europe although one study found no clear association between C. difficile isolation and diarrhoea [2, 3] . Porcine Clostridium difficile -associated disease (CDAD) typically manifests itself as early-onset diarrhoea and sudden death in piglets 1-7 days of age. Gross lesions may include mesocolonic oedema and large intestines may be filled with pasty to watery yellowish contents. Histopathological mucosal lesions are limited to the caecum and colon. They are typically mild, but vary from grossly inapparent, multifocal necrosis of surface epithelial cells to transmural necrosis. The classic lesions are segmental erosions of the epithelium with effusion of fibrin and neutrophils into the lumen, so-called \"volcano ulcers\" [4] .",

C. difficile produces two major toxins, Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB) that act synergistically to cause apoptosis of mucosal epithelial cells and disruption of intracellular actin filaments responsible for cell to cell adhesion. Consequently, there is increased permeability of mucosal surfaces. Toxins A and B also initiate an inflammatory cascade that can result in increased damage to host tissues and fluid exudation [6] . The requirements for development of CDAD are disruption of normal intestinal or colonic flora, presence of the organism in the environment, and the production of toxins [5] .",

C. difficile infection in the four piglets here appeared to be acting only as one component in a multifactorial diarrhoea that also involved Group B rotaviruses and possibly Clostridium perfringens Type A. Ongoing surveillance is required to determine the relative significance of C. difficile in porcine neonatal diarrhoea in Ireland. This is also the first report of PCR-ribotyping of C. difficile isolates from clinically affected Irish pigs. There are a number of different molecular methods available for strain typing, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based ribotyping, multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) [13, 14] . PCR ribotype 078 is the most commonly reported isolate from pigs in most studies, including a recent Irish study in pigs of different ages [2, [14] [15] [16] . In one study in humans this strain was shown to have increased by at least 6-fold from 2000 to 2008 [17] . Moreover, genetically indistinguishable C. difficile 078 stains have been found in pigs and farmers, indicating interspecies transmission but the route of transmission has not been determined [18] . Therefore there is increasing interest in C. difficile as a 'One Health' issue. Our findings of two ribotypes in this one herd are consistent with previous reports of diversity of C. difficile ribotypes amongst pigs in an international study of animal associated strains, and a previous report from Germany [19, 20] .",
