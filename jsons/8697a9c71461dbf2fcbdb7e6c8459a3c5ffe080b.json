The plan is a coordination framework that identifies key actors, their roles and responsibilities. These plans are supplemented with operational guidelines with specific actions that need to be conducted along the continuum of a legal death enquiry/ investigation. The MFRP should describe a multi-agency communication and coordination strategy for all actors involved in the process. This will allow the different actors to understand their responsibilities with full knowledge of an agreed upon set of standardized and complementary activities and practices that respect the interests of all actors and the public. A MFRP describes the activation criteria and mechanism for mass fatality management. This includes the legislation on response by the different authorities, the hierarchy of delivery and command and control structure for the response. It facilitates reporting conduits that are followed at all levels and by all actors to meet all complementary mandates. Routine death enquiries/investigations should confirm the identity and where, when, how and by what means the person died. These investigations are for all sudden, unexpected or unexplained deaths, including unexpected deaths from infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19. Not all deaths from COVID-19 will occur in a medical facility. Therefore, proper training and supervision must be provided to first or emergency responders attending a reported death to ensure safe management of the death scene. Basic management of the dead practices should be followed and are essential in all cases. These procedures are particularly important when the volume of deaths increases sharply, exerting stress on both human resource and facility capacity. Adequate attention to families of the deceased is also part of the response. A public communication and media strategy, delivered through designated communication centres and/or broadly accessible networks, should provide regular, reliable and transparent public communication. This conduit should represent the plans and operational aspects of the consortium of actors participating in the response and offer regular updates and progress reports. Protection of personal information legislation must be complied and SOPs must be implemented to ensure protection. The MFRP does not merely provide direction for the adequate mass handling and/or disposal of bodies. On the contrary, the plan describes operational practices, the supporting financial, administrative and logistical systems that allows for the professional and dignified search for, recovery, examination, identification, storage and return of bodies to the families for burial. All these steps should be generating standardized documentation which contains important information that should be protected and centralized to support not only investigative aspects of case management, but it is also required for planning, operations, logistics, administration and finance, and reporting. It also describes policies and procedures in relation to managing unclaimed and unidentified bodies, documentation of identification features for future comparison, and their temporary disposition. All these phases require a thorough understanding of existing capacities, capabilities, and prior acknowledgement of the gaps where solutions are needed. A MFRP describes occupational health, safety requirements that protect responders and practitioners. It lays out risk assessment criteria and establishes a dissemination mechanism to educate responders about reducing their risk of infection during infectious disease outbreaks. Equally, it addresses the need for skills training on safety control mechanisms, safety tools and equipment to first responders, mortuary personnel, laboratory technicians, and other individuals involved with body and human remains handling. This would also include the importance of safety bulletins communicated to families and communities where COVID-19 infected bodies were recovered to reduce their further contamination. Mass graves are highly discouraged. They are often a demonstration of poor planning by authorities, shows a disregard for the wishes, cultural/religious rites of families and communities. Single graves are respectful and dignified, they promote the traceability of human remains. This can only be accomplished, however, by collaborative planning between authorities and other relevant industries, such as funeral homes, crematoriums and cemeteries and most importantly the families. Mass fatality events often include deaths of both nationals and foreigners. Internationally accepted best practices and procedures that promote the dignified and professional management of the dead and respectful engagement with people of different backgrounds, cultures and religions must be upheld. This will facilitate the sometimes complex administrative and legal procedures of foreign governments when seeking repatriation of bodies to the country of residence or requesting assistance with notifications of death to relatives living abroad.

Establish a coordination group with a multiagency approach. It is important to include hospital administrators, religious authorities, municipal services, cemeteries and crematoriums for a truly integrated response.

Ensure a proper response is in place to cover all those aspects of the management of the dead process, including consider the investigative needs of law enforcement agencies in cases that apply. Local authorities should also ensure that any participation by volunteers or private businesses follow the same procedures. A good understanding of the local capacities for MotD, mainly in relation to transportation, storage and body disposal is a baseline to determine further steps in the multiagency approach. Ensure there is sufficient capacity in terms of infrastructure, human resources, materials and self-protective equipment to respond to the increased number of deaths.

Ensure management level or coordination staff at the different entities provide clear procedures and recommendations in relation to the handling of bodies to all those concerned.

Body storage differs from temporary mortuaries that entail the capacity to conduct post-mortem examinations/ autopsies. Establish a mechanism to coordinate the procurement, staffing and storage of all bodies, identify potential facilities/premises suitable for body storage. The coordination group should be informed about the existing body storage capacity. Existing facilities may be found within hospitals, public and private funeral homes and forensic services. Consider military assets. In some cases, universities may have additional storage capacities for bodies. Some limitations exist in towns and cities where there is only the public mortuary capacity available. Even if the decision is to bury bodies as soon as possible, or to cremate identified bodies in certain contexts, the body will undoubtedly remain in storage for a period of time before burial while administrative and logistical requirements are satisfied (i.e. while the death certificate is issued, the authorization for cremation or burial, ongoing investigations, awaiting family notification, etc.). Therefore, additional body storage must be addressed in advanced. All phases of the MotD, even when capacities are increased, may incur additional challenges during a pandemic as handling bodies believed to be infectious require additional precautionary measures. A proper storage area allows for continuity of other stages of the process. Be aware of the minimum standards for setting up temporary body storage facilities such as single level facility or establishment with suitable access for loading/unloading, secured premises, permanent access for big capacity vehicles, entrances, exits and windows obscured from media and the public, electricity and plumbing, appropriate height for stacked shelves, identification and body viewing facilities, office spaces, staff amenities, and welfare facilities. Other considerations such as sealed floors, impervious concrete or covered in non-slip waterproof rubber flooring, cleaning of surfaces, appropriate disposal of waste, etc. should be revised considering also local regulations, environmental risk assessments, environmental permits, etc. Prepare a list of equipment to consider for temporary body storage. During the MotD it is especially important in the storage and transportation phases that body identification and labelling is carried out with at least three identifiers including one unique identifier (i.e. body number, date, place of recovery).
