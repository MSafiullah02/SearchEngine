This mobility can be pendular (transhumance) or random (nomadism) based on short or long distance. For example, the mobility of Afar tribes across the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti is based on short distance (Faye 1994). In reverse, the movement of camel herds in Chad can be of a large amplitude from North Chad up to beyond RCA (Central African Republic) border (Aubague et al. 2011). Thus, the transboundary camel herd moving is not necessary linked to the distance of the cameleers\u2019 camp to the border. However, the potential risk for disease spread increases with the covered distance, the cohabitation between animals of different origins (and different species) occurring mainly around water point (Photo 6.1) throughout the transhumance route.\n",

            "text": "Contrary to camel milk, essentially limited to local or national market, camel meat is the object of transboundary trade based on living animals. The camel population in the world estimated to 35 million heads (FAOstat 2019) is probably underestimated (Faye and Bonnet 2012) due to the difficulties of census for a mobile species and the absence of official vaccination. So, it is difficult to assess the exact percentage of camels involved in such transboundary trade. The camel flow in relation to the living camel export is consequently also underestimated. In Sahelian region, the camel flow for export is mainly from South to North. Camels in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Ethiopia are the main exporting countries of living camels to North Africa (Morocco but overall Libya, Egypt, and Algeria to a lesser extent) and to the Arabian peninsula (Faye et al. 2013). For example, the slaughtering rate which is around 7% at world level reaches 95% in Egypt, 75% in Saudi Arabia, 50% in Emirates, and 31% in Morocco and Libya which shows the importance of imports for the national camel meat markets. In reverse, less than 5% of the camels are slaughtered in Sahelian countries for their local demand. Probably, this percentage is also underestimated due to a large part of slaughtering occurring in the remote pastoral area, not included in the official data (Aklilu 2002). Along the Red Sea, some ports (Port-Sudan, Djibouti, Hargeisa, Mogadishu) are hubs for camel export by boat to Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, and Emirates. In Western and Central Africa, the export is achieved by land, sometimes using trucks but overall by foot as the \u201cforty-days road\u201d from El-Obeid (Sudan) to Aswan (Egypt) through the Nubian Desert. If the main flow is South-North (Africa) or South-South (Horn of Africa), recently new flows occurred from the same Sahelian countries to coastal countries like Senegal (coming from Mauritania) or Nigeria (coming from Niger and Chad). Indeed, the recent demand for camel meat for dietetic reason (camel meat is poor in cholesterol and has a high protein value) or even for supposed virtues (it is believed that camel meat is aphrodisiac and cures hypertension) is increasing significantly in these countries (Kurtu 2004; Kadim et al. 2008; Raiymbek et al. 2015).",

            "text": "In a recent analysis of the camel flow in the Horn of Africa, using different sources of data to assess the importance of the camel chain in the economy, a gap was observed between official data (41,000 camels should be exported every year on average from Ethiopia) and the true potential of export. Such a gap is because only a part of the camel flow is passing through official way (Belachew 2005; Alary and Faye 2016). In Somalia, for example, only 10% of the exported animals would use formal trade. This low part could be explained partly by insecurity along the export routes, especially since the Somalo-Ethiopian war in 1977 and the civil war in Somalia since the 1990s. Indeed, Somalia was the most important camel exporting country all along the twentieth century, and the Horn of Africa represents more than 60% of the estimated camel world population. The pivotal role of Somalia in this regional camel trade started at the end of the nineteenth century; the Somali pastoral area (that covered the eastern part of Ethiopia, northern part of Kenya, and central and northern part of Somalia) established a well-functioning market chain to supply the Brittany garnison established at Aden in 1839. The international trade was extended to include the Persian areas and the boarders of the Indian continent (Djama 1999). The economic boom of the Arabian peninsula with the development of \u201coil era\u201d stimulated the demand for camel meat and the transboundary camel trade in the region.",

            "text": "The Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic arboviral disease caused by a Phlebovirus transmitted by mosquitoes. This disease can affect dromedaries. In camels, RVF provokes abortion and over-mortality among the young animals. It is not a specific disease to camels. In addition, the disease can be transmitted to humans and could be lethal. Thus, several outbreaks in Africa largely affected human population in Egypt in 1977 and in West Africa in 1987. In Mauritania, the first severe outbreak occurred in 1987 in Senegal Valley causing the deaths of 28 people. This first outbreak was attributed to some changes in the pluviometry regime marked by late and intensive rains. Later, other outbreaks occurred, in 1998, 2002\u20132003, and 2010 (in the North of the country) and in 2012, all over the country (El-Mamy et al. 2011, 2014). The last outbreak was probably started by a sick dromedary camel, slaughtered by the owner before it died, but causing the deaths of several contaminated people with intestinal and hemorrhagic symptoms (El-Mamy et al. 2014). The virus being probably introduced through affected camels transported by truck in grazing areas, the risk of spreading all along the export routes could be high. However, thanks to the rapid appropriate control measures (restriction of livestock movement, re-allocation of locust control teams for mass insecticide spraying, risk communication, and public awareness campaigns) by the veterinary and public health authorities, the spread of the virus was limited, although the fall of the livestock\u2019s price (up to 40% decrease) created an attractive opportunity for the traders. Yet, the risk of transboundary dissemination to North African countries having similar ecosystem and rainfall conditions is high. Such epidemiological risk encouraged, since 2000, the creation of the Mauritanian Network for the Epidemio-surveillance of Animal Diseases (REMEMA) under the OIE rules and supported by FAO. This network, based on \u201csentinel herds,\u201d has made it possible to control the international exchanges of camels during the outbreaks.",

This disease was characterized by febrile attacks, highly contagious respiratory syndrome with high morbidity (up to 90%), and mortality varying from 5 to 70% depending on the herd and treatment administered (Roger et al. 2000). The high prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in the zone as well as symptoms like those of rinderpest suggested the presence of morbillivirus (Roger et al. 2001). Similar observations were published in Sudan (Khalafalla et al. 2005) where several mortal epizooties have been reported in the early 2000s, as well as in Kenya, without clearly identifying the causal agent although PPR virus was suspected. The pastoralists of these countries considered those diseases as new ones and attributed to them vernacular names, e.g., Firaanfir, Laaba, or Yudleye (Khalafalla et al. 2010). The outbreak, however, was apparently confined in the Horn of Africa and has moved throughout the borders of the region in relation to herd mobility, but probably not exported to camel importing countries.",

MERS-Cov seropositivity and percentages of MERS-Cov RNA-positive camels were not more important in the two major Saudi camel import entrance ports of Jeddah and Gizan where an increased likelihood of contacts between imported dromedary camels from the Horn of Africa and local Saudi Arabian dromedary camels was expected. Finally, MERS-Cov prevalence appeared higher in local Saudi camels compared to those imported from Somalia or Sudan (Sabir et al. 2016). Recent investigations revealed the presence of two lineages of sub-Saharan MERS-Cov, genetically distinct from virus found in Saudi camels. Moreover, it is stated that the MERS-Cov is poorly transmissible from camels to humans, and clinical human MERS disease is not proportional to potential exposure of humans to virus circulation in camels (Hemida et al. 2014). According to certain authors (Younan et al. 2016), the control measures of Saudi camels should be a priority to those imported from the Horn of Africa. Indeed, the control of an endemic coronavirus infection among nomadic tribes in Africa appears unrealistic. Moreover, the lack of human cases in Egypt or Libya who also import many camels from Sudan or Somalia seems to indicate that control system of the disease based only on the trade restriction is not necessarily efficient in the case of Saudi Arabia. However, it is probably different in camel countries \u201cMERS-Cov free\u201d as in Central Asia or Australia (Miguel et al. 2016).

The BSE outbreak started in 1996 in the United Kingdom has provoked an important crisis for both public health and cattle meat economy. Since this crisis, scientific community, stakeholders of the meat sector, and public health authorities were highly sensitive to the risks linked to animal prions, especially because of their potential passage to humans. Moreover, the presence of BSE conducted to ban live animals\u2019 export in many countries, impacting the livestock economy. It is interesting to note that such a ban imposed by Egypt for European bovines after BSE outbreak is responsible for the high increasing demand for camel meat in the country.",

The camels showed symptoms comparable to that of \u201cmad cow disease.\u201d The animals found in the desert had difficulty in getting up. At the abattoir, they showed aggressiveness and became nervous when forced to cross an obstacle and showed down- and upwards movements of the head and teeth grinding. These symptoms occurred in 3.1% of dromedaries brought at Ouargla abattoir in 2015\u20132016. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting prion protein in brain tissues from three symptomatic animals. Prion detection in lymphoid tissues is suggestive of the infectious nature of the disease. The potential risks for human and animal health are not yet assessed. Obviously, Algeria is not an important camel export country, but the exchanges with the Middle East and Maghreb represent a potential risk of transboundary spreading of the disease, especially because the true occurrence of the disease in Algeria and neighboring regions is unknown. However, a recent case was reported in Tunisia.",

But, because its breeding is concentrated in southern countries (notably in Sahelian ones) where the disease surveillance systems often lack means, where the frontiers in desert areas are often \u201cporous,\u201d and where the importance of herd movements is difficult to assess, the risk of disease spreading through the borders is high, especially since the informal trade can be dominant and achieved by foot. For the moment, the challenge of TADs control is limited to Rift Valley fever, but special attention must be paid to emerging diseases, including the recent discovery of prion disease.",
