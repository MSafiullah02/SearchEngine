            "text": "In the cytosol of bacteria, the degradation of proteins and polypeptides is performed by LON and CLPP (caseinolytic peptidase P), among other proteases (1). These two enzymes show high phylogenetic conservation, but their complementary roles are not understood. Mitochondrial LONP1 contains domains with protease and ATPase activity on the same polypeptide, and is considered as the main factor for proteolysis of soluble substrates in the matrix compartment. Furthermore, mutant LON/PIM1 yeast strains also exhibit defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (2). In contrast, mitochondrial CLPP lacks ATPase activity and each subunit contains only the domain for digestion of small peptides without ATP requirement. Through association with the ATPase and chaperone CLPX, activation of CLPP as serine protease occurs for the ATP-dependent digestion of larger proteins (2). Both CLPP and CLPX have been studied intensively in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and other prokaryotes (3). Purification and structural biology studies showed that hexameric rings of the ATPase CLPX or specific other AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) proteins of the HSP100 family (CLPA, CLPC) (4,5) depend on ATP in order to bind two heptameric CLPP rings at either end, thus forming a barrel-shaped CLPP proteolytic chamber. Unfolded substrates are translocated by CLPX into this cylinder to be cleaved in fragments with an average product length of 10 residues. These products are further degraded to free amino acids by exopeptidases (3). CLPX determines substrate specificity of the complex. CLPX was found to recognize specific unstructured peptide sequences and usually unfold the corresponding proteins. The unstructured domains are named degrons, such as the C-motif 1/ssrA tag (6). Degrons are thought to be exposed, e.g. in nascent peptides on stalled ribosomes, as well as in unassembled subunits of ribosomes and other macromolecular complexes (3). Several specific degrons were characterized in detail. Individual repair proteins like RecN are synthesized at high levels during cell stress, but efficiently removed by the CLPXP protein complex upon return to the unstressed state, to avoid deleterious effects (7,8). Similarly, a degron in sigmaS, the master regulator of general stress response in E. coli, is responsible for CLPXP recognition and degradation in growing cells (9). With a slightly different mechanism, the degron in RseA ensures its degradation by CLPXP in times of cell stress, thus derepressing the sigmaE factor to induce genes responsible for the envelope stress response (10). Interestingly, CLPXP-mediated degradation of the bacteriophage repressor and of the O protein as an initiator of phage DNA replication (11,12) vary with growth conditions and thus modulate the bacteriophage lysis-versus-lysogenization decisions, i.e. bacterial immunity.",

Contrary to the vast knowledge about CLPP structure and biochemistry in prokaryotes, relatively little is known about the biological role of CLPP in eukaryotes. In good agreement with a CLPP role in cell stress and protein quality control, its expression is induced by stressors in eukaryotes as in prokaryotes (13\u201315). Recent data showed a surprising increase in healthy lifespan due to a deletion of the gene encoding CLPP in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina (16). In Caenorhabditis elegans, the loss of CLPP modulates mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (17,18). Mammalian studies reported the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix to induce the expression of CLPP in parallel to mitochondrial chaperones such as mtHSP60, mtHSP10 and mtDNAJ, and in dependence on the transcription factors CHOP and C/EBPbeta (13,19,20). Human CLPXP was found to constitute a bona fide ATP-dependent protease and assemble similarly as E. coli CLPXP, but to differ in substrate selection (21).",

An additional role of CLPP in neurodegenerative diseases is suggested by several observations. CLPP mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in response to a dominant negative mutation of mtHSP60 that results in a clinical manifestation as spastic paraplegia (23,24). A progressive increase of CLPP protein levels due to the disturbed assembly of mitochondrial iron\u2013sulfur clusters results from frataxin deficiency in Friedreich's ataxia (25). CLPXP or other mitochondrial proteases, as HTRA2, PARL, the SPG7/AFG3L2 subunits of the m-AAA complex, as well as OPA1, were also implicated in age-associated neurodegeneration syndromes (26) such as Parkinson's disease (27\u201329), spinocerebellar ataxia (30,31), spastic ataxia\u2014neuropathy syndrome (32), spastic paraplegia (33) and optic atrophy (34), multiple diseases with established pathology regarding respiration, lipid organelles, protein aggregates and neuroinflammation. Thus, the mitochondrial protein quality control system and in particular CLPXP has an important impact on fertility, survival and neural aging (35\u201337).",

Early, severe and tissue-specific pathologies were observed, which represent a quite faithful model of the human Perrault syndrome. Ovarian dysgenesis was explained by follicular differentiation failure, and in addition testis pathology due to spermatic differentiation failure was documented, resulting in complete female and male infertility in mice. Severe tissue-specific pathology was also observed for auditory responses in analogy to Perrault syndrome. The underlying chain of molecular events was assessed by hypothesis-driven and unbiased expression studies, demonstrating ubiquitous effects for the transcriptional up-regulation of other mitochondrial chaperones, the CLPX accumulation in spite of mRNA down-regulation, the mtDNA accumulation, the induction of an inflammatory transcriptome signature and the growth impairment. In contrast, the respiratory dysfunction was marginal. Thus, the absence of CLPP is compensated well by most tissues although light inflammatory stress is triggered by the mitochondrial quality control failure. Profound early pathology occurs in gonad cells that are characterized by physiological dramatic reductions of mitochondrial numbers, underscoring the importance of CLPP for the degradation of mitochondrial components.",

The murine Clpp gene was already characterized and shown to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart and liver, encoding a mature protein of 34 kDa in size (39). Mouse embryonal stem cells with insertions of the gene-trap construct within the Clpp gene were commercially available from the Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine (TIGM). Embryonal stem cell lines IST11134F10 (line F) and IST13563G11 (line G) with GeneTrap insertions in heterozygous state at Clpp intron 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 1A), were obtained and a reduction in Clpp transcript levels to \u223c50% was demonstrated by real-time RT\u2013PCR (data not shown). Heterozygous breeders from each founder line were purchased and mated to study the Clpp\u2212/\u2212 mutant and the littermate control offspring in comparison. Almost complete absence of Clpp transcripts due to the GeneTrap insertion was observed in all tissues studied from Clpp\u2212/\u2212 animals (Fig. 1B). The absence of CLPP protein was also confirmed in four representative tissues, i.e. liver (chosen for high mitochondrial content), testis (maximal mitochondrial fusion within sperm midpiece), ovary (progressive failure in Perrault syndrome), brain (neural tissue with high respiration and complex mitochondrial distribution) and heart (high respiration and mitochondria surrounding muscular contractile apparatus) (Fig. 1C).\n",

The relevance of additional bands with CLPX immunoreactivity cannot be interpreted in absence of a CLPX-knock-out tissue, but it is important to note that two isoforms of Clpx mRNA were previously described in testis (40). Similar amounts and parallel regulation of CLPP and CLPX would be expected in view of their cooperative functions and of previous proteomic data reporting similar intermediate levels in 14 mouse tissues (41), but previous reports on Clpp mRNA showed the levels to vary between tissues (39,40,42). In conclusion, we observed an inverse correlation between CLPP and CLPX levels in the null mouse, suggesting that CLPX turnover depends directly on CLPP, while indirect effects or an up-regulation of CLPX translation in response to the CLPP deletion cannot be excluded.",

In the subsarcolemmal space an increased number of enlarged mitochondria, which displayed also irregular cristae membrane organization, was detected upon negative stain electron microscopy. Electron dense granules or paracrystalline structures were not observed (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4B). Thus, only mild signs of mitochondrial dysfunction and compensatory effects were observed.

In total, this transcriptome study revealed 4266 down- and 7985 significant up-regulations in testis, in comparison with 340 down- and 344 up-regulations in the heart, 418 down- and 310 up-regulations in the liver, 155 down- and 125 up-regulations in the brain at the medium adult age of 9\u201310 months. Only very few transcript dys-regulations affected all tissues consistently. Ubiquitous transcript inductions were observed for the protease Mmp14, for the antioxidants glutathione S-transferase alpha enzymes Gsta1/Gsta2 and for the iron-binding transcriptional coregulator Pir (Supplementary Material, Table S2). Specifically in the testis, a high proportion of subunits of the extra-mitochondrial proteasome and of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways showed dys-regulation (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5), providing evidence that nuclear-encoded factors of the cytosolic protein degradation machinery change their expression levels in response to the impaired mitochondrial degradation. Interestingly, several subunits of the immunoproteasome were induced there (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5). These testis expression data jointly suggest that the degradation pathology in the mitochondrial matrix is perceived by the eukaryotic cell, which triggers compensatory degradation efforts with induction of cytosolic proteases/proteasome subunits.",

Furthermore, the accumulation of CLPX levels in Clpp\u2212/\u2212 tissues is also linked to mtDNA, since CLPX was recently shown to control the condensation and maintenance of mtDNA (56). In this context, it was remarkable that our systematic expression analyses had uncovered a ubiquitous significant up-regulation of the transcript levels for the mitochondrially encoded Cox1, but not for other nuclear encoded subunits of the respiratory chain (Table 1, Supplementary Material, Table S2). To test the hypothesis that abnormal amounts of mtDNA underlie the elevation of Cox1 transcripts, we quantified the DNA levels of another mitochondrially encoded complex IV subunit, Cox3, in comparison with the DNA levels of the nuclear encoded complex I subunit Ndufv1. The quantitative real\u2013time PCR (qPCR) results demonstrated several-fold accumulation of mtDNA in Clpp\u2212/\u2212 compared to Clpp+/+ tissues, with high significance for the testis, ovary, heart and brain (Fig. 5), and in excellent agreement with the fold-changes of Cox1 transcript levels in these Clpp\u2212/\u2212 tissues (Table 2). Thus, the absence of CLPP affects not only the degradation of proteins, but also the maintenance of mtDNA in the mitochondrial matrix in different tissues, with effects on transcript levels of mitochondrially encoded genes.\n",

Similarly, mouse mutants of several other mitochondrial factors have manifested phenotypes of growth retardation and reduced survival, in particular due to light respiratory impairment, oxidative stress and mtDNA damage (59\u201375). Prominently, Clpp deletion caused selective profound vulnerability of specific cells in testes and ovaries.

A recent publication reported CLPP missense and splice site mutations (22) in Perrault syndrome, but CLPP mutations were not yet linked to male infertility and lack of sperm. Possibly the phenotype in mice varies from human, but it is also conceivable that the murine CLPP null mutation has a stronger fertility phenotype than the human CLPP missense/splice site mutations, which may cause only partial CLPP activity loss. Thus, it will be important to screen male patients with a syndrome of azoospermia, short stature and neural dysfunction for CLPP mutations. Conversely, it will be important to conduct systematic screening of the auditory deficit in Clpp\u2212/\u2212 mice assessing the affected tissue also with histology and molecular profiling.

First, the accumulation of CLPX; second, the up-regulation of mitochondrial matrix chaperones; third, the elevated levels of mtDNA; fourth, the induction of an inflammatory signature and finally, the growth retardation affecting all tissues. Therefore, it is important to consider what the likely causal chain of events between these findings could be. Our data show that the absence of CLPP leads to CLPX accumulation in spite of down-regulated Clpx transcript levels. The likeliest explanation is that CLPX degradation is reduced and depends on CLPP, and that the pathologically increased CLPX protein levels are insufficiently compensated by decreased transcript levels. In contrast, the elevated levels of other mitochondrial matrix chaperones through transcriptional up-regulation might constitute the crucial compensatory effort which prevents earlier pathology in tissues like the brain. The elevated CLPX levels may be responsible for mtDNA accumulation, since a recent report showed CLPX to act not only as chaperone for unfolded proteins, but to be also important for the condensation of mtDNA, similar to TFAM (56). It is well established that the elimination of mitochondrial number as well as mtDNA reaches its physiological maximum during the maturation of germ cells. During spermatogenesis, the number of mtDNA nucleoids should be reduced from 10 000 or 1000 copies per cell to \u223c100 copies per spermatozoon. During oogenesis, mitochondrial number would decrease while going through a quality control bottleneck, before expanding to \u223c100 000 copies per oocyte (90,91). Therefore the selective and strong testis and ovary pathology in the CLPP null mice might be due to the pathological accumulation of CLPX and mtDNA. While depletion of mtDNA has been described as a consequence of mutations in numerous genes (92), a strong accumulation as in CLPP null tissue has not been documented previously. Our data establish CLPP as a modifier factor for the reduction of mtDNA levels.",

            "text": "The CLPP effect on inflammation and infection defense factors could be interpreted in the light of two observations made in prokaryotes. First, in E. coli CLPP was observed to influence the lysis-lysogeny decision during bacteriophage mu infections (11,93) and second, a report in Staphylococcus aureus showed Clpp deletion to result in poor growth accompanied by prophage proteome accumulation and increased prophage release in some strains (94). Also in mammals the antiviral defense system and interferon induction are modulated crucially by mitochondria, through four known factors, namely matrix-localized NLRX1 and outer membrane-associated MAVS, ECSIT and STING (52,53). Thus, in spite of the vast differences the bacterial and eukaryotic immune defense systems, CLPP deficiency might modulate antiviral defense. In this case, a novel functional parallel between the mitochondrial CLPXP machinery and the cytosolic proteasome would become apparent, since the latter is well known to respond to infections and inflammations via interferon-gamma exposure by adapting its composition and proteolysis pattern, thus serving as immunoproteasome (95). Thus, although our mice were bred and aged in individually ventilated cages, with the absence of pathogenic infections being documented in regular health screens, we cannot exclude an undetected viral exposure of some mice that might explain our data partially. However, the transcriptome analyses documented a genotype-dependent elevation of immunity factors in every one of several mice and tissues, and the cellular analyses of splenocytes in independent animals confirmed this genotype-dependent effect. Furthermore, almost all mice in both Clpp\u2212/\u2212 lines across their lifespan showed resistance against ulcerative dermatitis. This skin condition is typical of murine C57BL/6 substrains during aging, does not respond to antibiotic or corticosteroid treatment, and is thought to arise from pruritus due to follicular dystrophy, with later bacterial superinfections by skin commensals (44,96). This general reduction of vulnerability of Clpp\u2212/\u2212 animals toward an inflammatory disease is a strong argument that the CLPP effect on immunity occurs irrespective of infections.",

Our data demonstrate that Clpp\u2212/\u2212 deletion leads not only to the induction of mitochondrial chaperones, but also to transcriptional up-regulation of proteasome subunits and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis factors, suggesting that non-degraded CLPP substrates are released from mitochondria to the eukaryotic cytosol. This appears possible, since C. elegans CLPP was shown to modulate the peptide efflux from isolated mitochondria (18) and since retrograde export even of entire proteins across the mitochondrial membrane pore is possible (97). Eukaryotic cells recognize the appearance of microbial fragments by specific receptors for the typical formylated amino acids and hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides, eliciting responses of innate immunity against such PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) (52\u201355). Similarly, LC3B-deficient mice with impaired autophagic degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria and subsequent accumulation of mtDNA in the cytosol were recently demonstrated to have significantly higher secretion of interleukins IL-1beta and IL-18 (98). Thus, we speculate that eukaryotic tolerance to mitochondria is challenged intrinsically in Clpp\u2212/\u2212 animals by exposure to accumulating mtDNA and to the release of formylated amino acids.

            "text": "Thus, CLPP is a strong suppressor of CLPX levels in different mouse tissues and plays a role in mtDNA turnover. Resulting mitochondrial dysfunction leads only to light bioenergetic deficits, is particularly well compensated for in brain, but is detectable in the muscle and the liver. In contrast, Clpp deletion leads to marked ubiquitous up-regulations in the levels of several mitochondrial matrix chaperones and of various inflammatory factors. At the cellular level, T-cell activation is observed in the spleen, while selective apoptosis occurs among spermatids and follicular granulosa cells. Histological findings were massive in the testis and the ovary with macroscopic tissue shrinkage. At the organism level, the presence of CLPP is a prerequisite for female and male fertility, corroborating the recent implication of CLPP in human Perrault syndrome. Additional age-associated phenotypes are apparent with severe growth retardation, as well as reductions of spontaneous activity and survival, contrasting with resistance to ulcerative dermatitis. Overall, we speculate that the degradation impairment in Clpp deletion constitutes a challenge to eukaryotic tolerance versus mitochondria and that sustained inflammation underlies the growth impairment. The deficit in reduction of mtDNA and mitochondrial numbers may underlie the infertility in the CLPP-variant of the recessive Perrault syndrome. We are convinced that the CLPP null mouse constitutes a reasonably faithful disease model and a valuable tool.",

Owing to the design of the experiment, two parameters (strain and tissue) have an impact on gene expression. Thus, a combined factor from both parameters was used to design a linear model that captures the influence on gene expression levels. Comparisons of CLPP homozygous null (\u2212/\u2212) and corresponding WT samples were defined as contrasts and the linear model coefficients were estimated. A non-specific filter based on overall variance was applied to remove non-informative features before the fitting of the linear model was performed. Empirical Bayes shrinkage of the standard errors was used to calculate the moderated F-statistic (107). The resulting P-values were established and corrected for multiple testing with \u2018Benjamini-Hochberg\u2019 (108). To attribute significant regulations to individual contrasts, a decision matrix was generated based on the function \u2018decide tests\u2019 within the limma package, where significant up- or down-regulations are represented by values of 1 or \u22121, respectively.

The dissected muscle tissue was dissolved in 10 ml washing buffer and stirred for 15 min in the presence of 1.25 mg trypsin (dissolved in 1 mm HCl). During incubation, the tissue was homogenized twice in a glass/teflon potter at 500 rpm for 1 min. Trypsinization was finally stopped by the addition of 6.5 mg trypsin inhibitor (from soy beans). The solution was filtered through polyamide filter cloth (pore size 210 \u00b5m, A. Hartenstein, W\u00fcrzburg) and the remnants of this filtration were transferred into 20 ml isolation buffer (100 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris\u2013HCl, 9 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 46 mm KCl, pH 7.4 + 1 mg/ml BSA fatty acid free) and homogenized once more at 500 rpm for 1 min. This solution was also filtered through the polyamide filter cloth and the two filtrates were combined. The combined solution was centrifuged for 15 min at 600g, and the supernatant was transferred into a new centrifugation tube. Mitochondria were collected by a high-speed centrifugation step (10 min at 5.700g) and re-dissolved in 20 ml isolation buffer. After a second round of low-speed (15 min at 600g) and high-speed centrifugation (10 min at 5700g) the mitochondrial pellet was finally dissolved in 1 ml isolation buffer.",

The respiratory control factor was determined as the ratio between state 3 and state 2 [following the revised nomenclature of (113)] respiration after the addition of 2 mm ADP. Subsequently, complex I was inhibited by adding rotenone (5 \u00b5M) and the complex II-dependent respiration was measured after adding succinate (5 mm). Finally, KCN (2 mm) was added to determine the mitochondria-independent oxygen consumption that was (if present) subtracted from all rates of the respective measurement.",

In short, after organ collection, the complete organ was stored at 4\u00b0C in 2\u20133 ml of RPMI/2% FCS. For further preparation, a part of each spleen was transferred into a cocktail of collagenase II (Serlabo Technologies SARL, Entraigues sur la Sorgue, France) and DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) within RPMI/2% FCS and dissociated using GentleMACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and the GentleMACS tissue dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Collagenase digestion at room temperature over 20 min was stopped with a 0.1 m EDTA-PBS solution. Then red blood cell lysis was performed with RBC lysis solution (eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, USA), cells were washed in PBS buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.45), then incubated with Fc block (anti-mouse CD16/32), fluorescence-conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) and washed. Cells had been plated on a 96-well plate, and the cells were acquired with a HyperCyt plate loader in combination with a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Germany, Krefeld). Analysis was done with FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Oregon USA); dead cells were eliminated on the basis of their propidium iodide signal and subpopulations gated for corresponding leukocyte markers.",
