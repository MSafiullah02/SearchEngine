Since the announcement of COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic, elimination of this disease has turned into a global health priority (2). However, without optimizing our knowledge about the efficient diagnosis and treatment of this disease, increase in infection and mortality rates is inevitable.",

Thus, it was essential to find a complementary strategy for time-efficient detection of this disease. Imaging quickly found its place as a critical tool, aiding in the diagnosis of patients suspicious for COVID-19 infection. So far, the literature has mainly emphasized on the role of chest computed tomography (CT) scan for screening and identifying COVID-19 patients, as well as evaluating severity and disease progression. In comparison to radiography, chest CT scan imaging is a more reliable and sensitive method to diagnose and assess COVID-19, especially in epidemic regions (4). Evaluating chest CT findings in combination with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests aids in the medical decision making for COVID-19 disease. In many regions of Iran, CT scan is more available than RT-PCR, the current standard confirmatory test of COVID-19. In these regions, chest CT is used as one of the first modalities for initial evaluation of suspected cases, aiding in prompt management before confirmation of diagnosis by PCR (5, 6). ",

This observation was previously reported by several other studies (10, 12, 13). However, one study has reported peripheral distribution in only 33% of investigated patients (14). Although various CT findings were observed in our cases, almost all cases had bilateral GGO in sub-pleural areas. It seems that exudative fluid accumulation within the alveolar space is the cause of this multi-lobar appearance. Since the predominant pattern is GGO, the superiority of CT scan over chest radiography is justified due to its higher resolution. It is assumed that low-dose CT scan might also be helpful; not only for diagnosis, but also for reducing radiation exposure, although further studies are needed (5). The majority of studies published so-far have also mentioned GGO, consolidation, and bronchial dilation as the main characteristic findings (4, 5, 14-19). This pattern of involvement is not pathognomonic and resembles that of other viral pneumonia, in particular, influenza. Other pathologies such as aspiration pneumonia also present with bibasilar consolidation similar to COVID-19 infection. Similar radiologic patterns are also found in interstitial lung diseases, such as organizing pneumonia or non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), in which predominant peripheral GGO or diffuse GGO is observed. Bilateral patchy areas of GGO are also found in conditions such as lung contusion in the setting of severe chest trauma (18, 20, 21). Thus, decision making based on appropriate clinical findings is crucial for correct diagnosis.",

Interestingly, the absence of these imaging features in COVID-19 has also been demonstrated by several other studies (4, 13, 14, 18). However, it is probable that these features develop in long-term, and thus, it is not possible to reach a conclusion through investigation of early imaging. Reversed halo sign is usually present in invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis, vasculitis and even tumor metastasis; however, viral infection is also another cause of this appearance. Although this sign has been seen in some COVID-19 cases, it is considered a late finding (5, 18).",

            "text": "Our results revealed that less than one-fifth of patients demonstrate severe GGO on admission. It has been shown that after two weeks from initial symptoms, as consolidation begins to resolve, GGO becomes more extensive (15). This might explain the low rate of severe GGO observed in this study, as our patients were investigated within one week of symptom onset. We observed a significant association between elevated GGO score and presence of dyspnea at presentation, although it did not correlate with other symptoms such as cough and fever. Also, severity of GGO was not affected by patients\u2019 age and sex. Notably, Zhou and colleagues also reported that dyspnea on admission was associated with increased odds of death, while fever and cough were not (22). Previous studies have stated that increase in the extent and density of GGO on CT can be used as a prognostic marker (13, 14). Several studies have displayed a significant association between higher CT score (based on extent of lung opacification) and a more severe course of COVID-19 disease (11, 23-25). In a recent study by Song et al., patients were classified into severe and non-severe groups based on clinical and imaging criteria. In this study, a self-designed CT scoring system was used as a marker for assessing the severity of the disease, showing a markedly higher CT score among patients with severe disease. Consistent with our study, they did not find a significant association between sex and disease severity; however, older cases were more likely to develop severe illness (23). Thus, although we were not able to measure the relationship between GGO severity and disease outcome, the significant association of dyspnea with a higher GGO score might indicate that the existence of this symptom at presentation indicates worse prognosis.",

Moreover, we only investigated the initial CT-scans obtained on admission and findings were not controlled in terms of the exact number of days after symptom onset (15, 26). The retrospective nature of the study might have also introduced selection bias. Another major flaw was that in the majority of cases, lab tests and patient outcome were not available. In addition, evaluation of features such as cavitation and pleural effusion requires follow-up. Thus, larger multi-center cohorts along with follow-up and complete data are necessary to validate the results.",

Our study also confirmed that ground-glass opacities and consolidation in the lung periphery is the imaging hallmark in COVID-19 infection. Bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance, discrete pulmonary nodules, cavitation, calcifications, reversed halo-sign and pleural effusions were uncommon findings. Conclusively, recognition of this pattern of chest involvement, in the proper clinical setting, is highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the association observed between dyspnea and extensive GGO on imaging might indicate that presentation with dyspnea is associated with worse prognosis compared to cough and fever. This finding could help medical staff with limited healthcare resources to predict cases with a possible worse outcome when triaging patients. Overall, imaging is valuable not only for early suspicion of the disease, but also for follow-up and evaluation of disease severity; however, further investigations are needed to shed light on the radio-clinical correlation of this disease.",
