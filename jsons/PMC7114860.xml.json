            "text": "The nature of the cellular receptor mediating HBV infection remained elusive long time after the discovery the virus [1], [2], [3]. Although some candidate molecules were found to bind to the envelope proteins of HBV, none of them ever demonstrated a virus receptor activity upon expression in non-susceptible cells, which is accepted as a strong criteria regarding whether a candidate is truly a functional virus receptor. Studies of the infection biology of HBV and its satellite virus hepatitis D virus (HDV), an RNA virus using HBV envelope proteins for its packaging and cellular entry, was hampered by the lack of a convenient cell culture system. Primary cultures of human hepatocytes (PHH) [4], [5], primary tupaia hepatocytes (PTH) [6], [7], [8], and a hepatoma cell line, HepaRG, after differentiation with DMSO [9], were the only cells susceptible to HBV and HDV. PHH and PTH are scarce and their susceptibility to the virus varies depending on the source as well as isolation and culture procedures. HepaRG cells require a 2-week differentiation period before cells become susceptible. Nonetheless, elegant work using these cell culture systems over the past decades has revealed some critical aspects of HBV entry [10]: (1) Infection of HBV exhibits extraordinary species and organ specificity, indicating existence of a highly specific interaction between the virus and the hepatocytes; (2) two of HBV three envelope proteins, namely the small (S) and large (L) envelope protein, but not the middle (M) protein are responsible for HBV entry [11], [12]; (3) the antigenic loop (AGL) of S protein [13] and the preS1 domain of L-protein are essential for HBV infection [14]; (4) the N-terminal region of preS1 domain requiring an uninterrupted sequence of 75 amino acids (genotype D) [15] with a myristoylation modification at the N-terminus [16], [17] critically contributes to infectivity, among which amino acid residues 9\u201316 are of vital importance [18], [19], [20]. The corresponding lipopeptide of this domain blocks viral infection in vitro and in vivo\n[19], [20], [21], [22].",

However, it was not an easy task to find its binding partner on hepatocytes and several non-functional molecules have been described [10]. Successful discovery of the bona fide receptor sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) was achieved using an innovative preS1 peptide ligand combined with proteome analysis of PTH and highly efficient tracing and purification processes [23]. Biochemical studies confirmed the interaction between preS1 and the liver specific bile acids transporter. Remarkably, transfection of HepG2 cells with NTCP expression DNA vector confers susceptibility to this otherwise non-susceptible cell [23]. This finding was quickly confirmed by several important studies, including a study demonstrating that human NTCP can confer susceptibility to HDV pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of bat hepadnavirus [24], woolly monkey HBV (WMHBV) also exploits NTCP for viral entry in tupaia hepatocytes [25] and HBV/HDV exploit NTCP for species-specific entry into hepatocytes [26]. Discovery of the receptor has also engendered new perspectives on HBV and its associated diseases [27].Key pointhNTCP expressing hepatoma cell lines are important tools to study HBV and HDV replication.\n",

            "text": "NTCP is coded by the SLC10A1 gene. It is a bile acid transporter, responsible for hepatic uptake of the majority of conjugated bile acids from blood, and plays a critical role in bile acids homeostasis and enterohepatic circulation [28]. The expression of NTCP and its subcellular distribution is subjected to precise regulation at multiple levels. NTCP contains up to nine transmembrane segments embedded in the cell membrane; its structure remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, although the NTCP gene is conserved in mammals, disrupting NTCP in mice in short term (ca. 2 months) did not result in significant abnormalities in the animals but led to elevated serum bile acids, in particular conjugated ones [29]. A single point mutation of R252H of human NTCP interferes with its surface expression on hepatocytes. Recently, a five-year old girl bearing this mutation was identified and she exhibited mild hypotonia, growth retardation, delayed motor milestones but no severe health problem [30]. Therefore, although the long-term consequence of disrupting NTCP needs more studies, the physiological role of NTCP can probably be compensated by other, yet not defined mechanism(s), and redundant pathways may operate in the absence of NTCP. Whether there is another receptor(s) for HBV entry is not known at present, however several lines of evidence support that NTCP is well suited as a key receptor for HBV (Fig. 1\n). It is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes [31], as also shown by the hepatotropism of its preS-ligand in vivo\n[32]. This is consistent with the high liver specificity of HBV. Furthermore NTCP resides on the sinusoidal side of hepatocytes [33], [34], [35], which is in line with the blood transmission of the virus. There is only very low or no expression of NTCP in hepatocarcinoma cell lines like HepG2 or HuH7 and the expression of NTCP rapidly decreases after isolation of primary hepatocytes from animals [23], [36], [37], [38]. These two features at least partially explain why normal liver cancer cells are resistant to HBV infection and why the susceptibility of primary hepatocytes persists for only a few days after isolation.",

The S267F is a mutation found mainly in Asian populations, with a minor frequency of ca. 10 % [40], [41], [42]. In cell cultures the mutation abolished taurocholate (TC) transport and over expression of S267F NTCP in HepG2 cells failed to support genotype D HBV and HDV infection [41]. The marked protection of this mutation against HBV infection at population level strongly argues that NTCP is a major viral receptor in human. A more recent genetic association study based on 3801 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients from Taiwan confirmed that the same mutation confers resistance to HBV infection and is independently associated with decreased risk of cirrhosis and HCC [42]. It is currently unclear how the mutation would reduce the risk of cirrhosis and HCC.",

There are several possibilities: first, cell surface molecules other than NTCP could mediate the viral infection; second, the virus was adapted to S267F-NTCP; third, the patients were genetically mosaic meaning some of their hepatocytes might still have wildtype NTCP. Clearly more work is needed to clarify these possibilities and related studies would help to deepen our understandings of HBV infection.",

            "text": "HBV only infects human, chimpanzees and northern treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri). It cannot infect non-human primates, mouse, rat and other experimental animals. However, once the HBV genome is delivered to the monkey hepatocytes, the virus can robustly replicate indicating that these cells are able to form cccDNA and replicate the virus [43]. Mouse hepatocytes bearing an HBV transgene can produce infectious virions but are unable to form cccDNA [44]. These observations support the hypothesis that the species restriction of HBV is largely at the entry level. Entry restriction is common in cross-species transmission of many viruses, for example: the infection of influenza virus among mammals and birds heavily depends on the existence of sialic acids (SA)-\u03b1-2,6-Gal\u2013terminated saccharides or (SA)-\u03b1-2,3-Gal\u2013terminated saccharides receptor [45]; and animal transmission of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is controlled by their receptors [46]. Whether NTCP is responsible for the species specificity at entry level was first examined by assessing HBV infection mediated by NTCP chimeras from crab-eating monkey (Macaca fascicularis) and human [23]. A small motif covering residues 157\u2013165 of NTCP was identified to be critical for preS1-binding and HBV infection, highlighting the critical role of NTCP in mediating HBV infection [23], [26]. The observation that cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes cannot bind the preS1-lipopeptide in vitro and in vivo strongly supported this finding [32], [34]. The key role of residues 157\u2013165 for HBV infection in humans has also been supported by the recent CHB population study in Taiwan, in which no mutation was found in this region in all CHB patients [42]. Interestingly, naturally occurring transmissible HBV infection (genotype D) was reported among M. fascicularis from Mauritius Island, however, the viral titre was very low and more evidence is needed to support that HBV undergoes a full life cycle in these monkeys [47].",

            "text": "The receptor-addressing preS1-lipopeptide can bind to primary hepatocytes from HBV non-susceptible animals, such as mouse, rat and dog [32], [34]. This finding was surprising and indicated the resistance of these animals to HBV at entry level was less likely due to the lack of a specific binding partner of the virus on the hepatocytes. Accordingly, either the binding could not lead to a productive infection, or there is difference between the isolated preS1 peptide versus the same region residing on the virions. Extensive mapping studies revealed that amino acid residues 84\u201387 in the first extracellular loop of NTCP restricted mice from infection of HBV at the entry level. Replacing three of these four amino acids with their human counterpart effectively render mouse NTCP a functional receptor for HBV in HepG2 cells [26], [48]. Consistent with the notion that NTCP poses the major barrier for viral infection of mice, suckling C57BL/6 mice bearing human NTCP are susceptible for HDV infection and the virus successfully undergoes most of its life cycles in the animal [49]. However, although mouse liver cells like Hepa1-6, Hep56.1D, mH274#26 supplemented with human NTCP support HDV infection, they failed to support HBV infection. These studies indicate that factors other than NTCP may be also involved in HBV infection. Although the nature of the factor(s) is still unknown, HBV infection studies based on cell fusion assays of HepG2 and mouse cells indicated that infection in mouse cells is limited by the lack of a host cell dependency factor [50]. Interestingly, a study recently indicated that the stability of viral nucleocapsids may be a determinant for cccDNA formation in murine hepatocytes (AML12) [51a]. Interestingly, this cell line, when supplemented with hNTCP supports infection with HBV [51b]. It will be important to further identify cellular factors to successfully establish a small animal model for HBV infection. On the other hand, one also has to be aware that viral infection in tissue culture can be influenced by the variables among different cell clones, the dosage of the inoculating virus and others factors that are different from the physiological conditions, therefore only viral infection of animals with defined gene alternations can provide definitive answer to the question.",

Targeted screening with HepG2-NTCP cells has identified glypican 5 (GPC5) as an entry factor for HBV/HDV [52]; viral infection based assay has found some promising drug candidates in blocking HBV/HDV infection [53], [54]. HBV can undergo its whole life cycle in HepG2-NTCP cells, from entry to establishment of the infection, and at a low efficiency of releasing of progeny virions. The covalent closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of HBV is the reservoir of chronic infection and is widely believed to be the major obstacle for eliminating the infection [55], [56]. HepG2-NTCP cells support cccDNA formation from incoming virions and are less efficient for the replenishment of cccDNA via intracellular recycling. Interestingly, although the carcinomatous nature of HepG2 cell is a concern for studies using HepG2-NTCP cells, a recent study indicates the epigenetic regulations of cccDNA in the cells are similar to those observed in PHH [57].",

Entry inhibition in persistently infected patients is presumably most efficient when virus spread requires entry of progeny virus into na\u00efve cells via a receptor-mediated pathway. In addition, a fast replenishment of infected cells by na\u00efve cells would limit the time of treatment to clear the infection. For HIV it has been shown that a direct spread from one cell-to-another can occur which might explain the therapeutic limitation of entry inhibitors [59], [60]. Nevertheless, Fuzeon\u00ae and maraviroc, two approved entry inhibitors, show antiviral activity in patients [60], [61], [62]. For HBV it has been demonstrated that spread in PHH-transplanted uPA severe combined immunodefficient (SCID) mice was completely blocked by the NTCP-specific entry inhibitor Myrcludex B. This indicates that intrahepatic spread greatly depends on an NTCP-mediated entry of progeny virus into na\u00efve hepatocytes [63]. Moreover, cccDNA-dissemination in the liver of these animals is abrogated by cell proliferation [64], indicating that HBV depends on an extracellular virus cycle and works poorly by transferring the cccDNA template via an intercellular pathway into progeny cells. Thus, entry inhibition for HBV may become clinically important in order to block cccDNA reformation during either natural or immune-mediated/induced hepatocyte turnover.",

Although they are not curative in HIV infected patients, they theoretically bear this potential even without the involvement of adaptive immune responses. This has been recently demonstrated in an immune-deficient animal model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [69]. However, the duration of treatment to gain virus elimination depends on the natural turnover rate of infected cells, the half-life time of the virus and the presence of possible viral reservoirs, which have been established in the host. Importantly, immune responses that are directed against infected cells may dramatically enhance the clearance of infected cells.

This hepatotropism is related to specific interactions of the viral envelope proteins with host factors, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) [71], [72], [73] and NTCP (see above). It has been shown that known substrates of NTCP as well as HSPGs interfere with HBV and HDV infection. These substances can be subdivided in different groups: firstly, natural or artificial substrates of HSPG like heparin, highly sulphated dextrans, suramin or negatively charged polymers [71], [72], [73]. They shall not be further discussed here. Secondly, substrates of NTCP, like the conjugated bile acid TC or glycocholic acid [26], [48], [74], [75]. These substrates but also bile salt homologues are transported by NTCP in a sodium dependent manner [28]. They bind into a pocket of the outward conformation of NTCP and are released (together with two sodium ions) after a substantial structural change to the inward conformation into the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte [53]. At high concentrations, conjugated bile salts inhibit HBV and HDV infection [41], [76]. The concentrations needed for infection inhibition are above the normal bile salt levels in healthy and HBV infected individuals, which probably explains the lack of therapeutic effects of bile salts in HBV/HDV infected patients [76].",

One example is ezetimibe, which is used as an inhibitor of the primary cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 in the intestinal lumen. It is also a substrate of NTCP [28] and has been later shown to interfere with HBV and HDV entry [78]. These substances have in common that the mechanism of HBV receptor inhibition is coupled to their ability to bind the substrate in the bile salt pocket and thereby block the receptor to interact with the virus. Evidence for that comes from the finding that determinants for viral entry and bile salt transport functionally overlap [41]. Accordingly, the reported KDs of transporter activity and HBV inhibition activity are comparable. In the future, it will be interesting to see whether small molecules that bind NTCP in its substrate pocket (e.g. bile salt analogues that might covalently bind to the transporter), could act as irreversible dead-end inhibitors.",

Its antiviral activity is not restricted to the natural product cyclosporine A, but also holds up for other derivatives including non-immunosupressive variants like alisporivir [74], [80]. Like for Myrcludex B (see below), the IC50s of cyclosporin A to inhibit HBV and HDV infection is significantly lower compared to its inhibitory effect on taurocholate (TC) uptake, indicating that a therapeutic effect against HBV might be achieved at non-NTCP-saturating concentrations [74].

            "text": "Due to the high sequence homologies in their receptor binding site, the N-terminal preS1-domains of primate HBVs, like WMHBV or Gorilla HBV and even the recently discovered Bat-hepatitis B viruses are assumed to specifically bind their respective host Ntcps. This interaction only occurs after a preceding interaction to and possibly activation by HSPGs. Remarkably, virions do not expose the N-terminal preS-1 NTCP binding site 9-NPLGFFP-15 on their surface [53]. Accordingly, HBV may hardly be recognized and inhibited by monoclonal antibodies recognizing this motif [82]. Moreover, chronically infected patients with high loads of preS-containing virions and subviral particles do not show elevated serum bile salt levels indicating that the NTCP may not or only partially blocked by the presence of these particles [83]. In contrast, synthetic preS1-derived lipopeptides that contain the NPLGFFP-motif are potent NTCP-binders and block the bile salt transporter function [26], [41], [75]. Such peptides have been characterized extensively with regard to their specific activities and the role of the fatty acid moiety which is required for anchoring the peptide in the membrane close to the NTCP binding site [9], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [84], [85], [86]. A lead substance of these peptides, which is presently in clinical development, is Myrcludex B. It efficiently inhibits HBV and HDV infection of hepatocytes at already picomolar concentrations [18]. Notably, Myrcludex B as a peptidic drug of 47 amino acids contains preS-specific epitopes including the essential receptor binding motif 9-NPLGFFP-15. It also contains C-terminally located epitopes (e.g. 19-DPAF-22), which may induce highly neutralising antibodies [87]. Accordingly, Myrcludex B therapy may induce anti-preS-specific antibodies that might help to eliminate HBV or HDV from the liver.",

These peptides also inhibit the bile acid transporter function, but only at ca. 500-fold higher concentrations [26], [75]. Functional recovery of NTCP is slow and probably only possible when the preS/receptor complex is dissociated after endocytic turnover or replacement by de novo synthesis [21]. Whether functional recycling of NTCP after formation of a preS-complex can occur is presently unknown. The reason for the remarkable differences in the IC50s of e.g. Myrcludex B between bile salt transporter (IC50 ca. 47 nM) activity and HBV/HDV infection inhibition (ca. 0.1 nM) is still unclear. However, a plausible assumption is that the HBV L-protein forms multimeric (e.g. trimeric) complexes with NTCP (as it has been shown for many other enveloped viruses). Such a complex could be functionally inactivated, if only one out of three binding sites is occupied by the peptidic fragment. In fact, NTCP has been shown to form multimeric complexes [88]. From a therapeutic point of view, this allows to inactivate the receptor function of NTCP at doses that do not significantly affect its natural function as a bile salt transporter.",

Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that doses of >10 mg subcutaneously resulted in NTCP saturation >80% for at least 15 h (Blank et al., under revision). The proof of clinical efficacy of Myrcludex B in chronically HBV infected patients has been achieved in a phase IIa clinical trial (Bogolomov et al., AASLD meeting 2014). A sub study of this trial was performed in HBV/HDV co-infected individuals (Bogolomov et al., under revision). The trial performed in HBeAg-negative HBV monoinfected patients shows a reduction in HBV serum levels by a mean of 101.45 within 12 weeks of treatment in the 10 mg arm. Assuming that Myrcludex B only interferes with de novo infection of cells and that the rate of virus production per infected cells remains unchanged, this indicates a substantial reduction of the number of infected cells during treatment. However, this has to be proven directly in future studies by immunohistochemistry of liver biopsies. In the sub study of 24 HDV co-infected HBV patients (Bogolomov et al., under revision) Myrcludex B was applied either alone at 2 mg daily, or in combination with PegIFN for 24 weeks. Myrcludex B was well tolerated in all patients, with only slightly increased conjugated bile salt levels. Within 24 weeks HDV RNA declined by >1 log in all cohorts and even became negative in two patients each in the Myrcludex B and PegIFN control arm. Remarkably, negativation was observed in five of seven evaluable patients of the Myrcludex B/PegIFN combination arm, indicating a synergistic effect both drugs.",
