After N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the most frequent species are N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and O-acetylated derivatives. Evidence is accumulating that esterified Sia are more ubiquitous than Neu5Gc. In contrast to Neu5Gc, they also occur in microorganisms. Figure 28 .1 shows the Sia family. One Sia molecule may carry one or several, up to three, O-acetyl groups. N-Acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) is most common. Acetyl ester groups are often a combined neuraminic acid with other residues such as N-glycolyl, O-lactyl, or O-methyl groups, and they may also be linked to 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (KDN) [1, 2] .",

            "text": "When studying the roles of O-acetylated Sia, exact analysis of their nature in biological materials is indispensable. The fundaments of these topics were described in this book's previous edition and elsewhere [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Here, only recent developments or considerations relevant to the following will be presented. Acquiring a better understanding of O-acetylated Sia was hampered since the ester groups are labile and easily hydrolyzed, in particular under acidic or alkaline conditions, possibly during isolation of glycoconjugates or by liberation of Sia from their glycosidic linkages. In addition, esterases, de-O-acetylating Sia, are abundant in tissues [15] and may also reduce the quantity of these Sia in biological materials when released during the tissue extraction process. In spite of these problems, the nature of Sia and the position and number of O-acetyl groups can best be identified in a free state after their liberation from glycosidic linkage and possibly by purification through ion-exchange chromatography. Hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds is carried out by sialidase or mild acids. The latter method has the advantage that all Sia linkages are opened at similar rates, in contrast to enzymatic hydrolysis. The use of propionic acid (2 M, 4 h, 80\u00b0C) gives an excellent yield of O-acetylated Sia without significant isomerization of the ester groups. During concentration of the hydrolyzate, propionic acid evaporates azeotropically, i.e., without concentration, which preserves ester groups; this is in contrast to the hydrochloric or sulfuric acid used earlier, which can damage the Sia. Now, better and more handy analytical techniques are available: direct application, i.e., without prior purification by ion-exchange chromatography, of Sia hydrolytically released; and chromatography on cellulose or silica gel thin layers, unless the sample contains too many impurities. Recently, it could be shown [16] that ion-exchange purification on strong alkaline resin, as carried out routinely for a long time [14] , leads to isomerization of Neu5,7Ac 2 to Neu5,9Ac 2 . Analysis of such a crude Sia sample is also possible by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the fluorescence-labeled Sia [14, 16] . The accuracy of the assay can be increased by de-esterification with mild alkali or influenza C virus esterase and sialate-pyruvate lyase treatment of the sample. Mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses of free and glycosidically linked O-acetylated Sia are described in [2, 14, 16] .",

For example, in fresh bovine submandibular gland mucin (BSM), most Sia residues are esterified with one or two, and rarely three, acetyls at the Sia glycerol side chain.

            "text": "Three O-acetyltransferases (SOATs) that specifically esterify Sia in different positions have been discovered: sialate-4-O-acetyltransferase, sialate-7-O-acetyltransferase, and sialate-9-O-acetyltransferase ( Fig. 28 .2, Table 28 .1). The SOAT from bovine submandibular gland was solubilized from its subcellular membrane location [32] by detergents and partially purified [4] . The enzyme has a molecular mass of 150-160 kDa, requires an (unknown) activator for full activity, and shows optimum activity at pH 6.5. CMP-Neu5Ac revealed to be the best substrate. It primarily incorporates the O-acetyl group at C-7 of Neu5Ac and can thus be defined as acetyl-CoA:sialate-7-Oacetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.45). Before, it was not clear whether it could also esterify the hydroxyl residue at C-9. 9-O-Acetylated Sia exist in high amounts in BSM beside the 7-O-acetylated Sia and always coexist with Neu5,7Ac 2 in other cells and tissues where Sia O-acetylation takes place at the side chain. This may be the result of one of two hypotheses: either 9-O-acetyltransferase activity is present additionally in these biological sources, or isomerization of Neu5,7Ac 2 to Neu5,9Ac 2 occurs. We favor the second hypothesis since it was shown that the O-acetyl group can migrate The O-acetyl group at the Sia glycerol side chain can migrate between C-7 and C-9, whereas the 4-O-acetyl group seems to be immobile. For further details, see the text (from [23] with permission of the publishers) spontaneously to C-9, yielding Neu5,9Ac 2 [33] . The frequent occurrence of small amounts of Neu5,8Ac 2 may be another product of this isomerization process. Since the migration speed is relatively slow at physiological pH, the existence of an isomerase (migrase) is still under discussion; however, firm evidence is lacking [4] . After the arrival of the acetyl at C-9, another acetylation at C-7 is possible, and after migration of this group to O-8, a third acetyl group may be attached to C-7, leading to a fully esterified side chain of Sia. Such Neu5,7,8,9Ac 4 was detected in small quantities in BSM, which have high O-acetylation potential. Furthermore, Neu5Ac is primarily O-acetylated at C-7 in starfish gonads (unpublished data) and in normal human lymphocytes (unpublished data) as well as in lymphoblasts of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [25] . The ganglioside GD3 was the best substrate in these experiments. The exact identification of the SOAT specificity was possible by using improved analytical tools, i.e., direct thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or HPLC analysis of the enzyme reaction products by which O-acetyl migration is avoided [23] .",

            "text": "Another SOAT, so far found only in mammals, is sialate-4-O-acetyltransferase (4-SOAT; EC 2.3.1.44). This enzyme was intensively studied in Golgi membranes from guinea pig liver [29] . It exhibits a broad substrate specificity ranging from free Sia, sialylated oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and gangliosides. This 4-SOAT has neither been isolated nor cloned. Corresponding activity was demonstrated also in the microsomal fraction from submandibular gland of horse. The tissues of this animal are rich in 4-O-acetylated Sia (unpublished data). The firm attachment of eukaryotic SOATs to subcellular membranes [32] , the difficulty in solubilizing these, and the failure to isolate the labile SOAT from BSM in pure form indicate that they are part of a protein complex. This possibly has functional significance. A cooperation of various proteins during SOAT reaction using AcCoA was already discussed by Varki's group, when studying the enzyme in rat liver microsomes [27] . Based on this and as a result of our studies with BSM, a model is shown in Fig. 28 .3. Accordingly, relying on in vitro studies, O-acetylation occurs before the transfer of Sia onto nascent mucin glycoproteins, since CMP-Neu5Ac is an excellent substrate for bovine [4] and human colon [24] 7-SOAT. [4] . It may be differrent in, for example, human lymphocytes, where GD3 was found to be the most suitable substrate for the O-acetyltransferase in vitro (unpublished data) That this may also occur in vivo is demonstrated by the isolation of CMP-glycoside of O-acetylated Sia from BSM [3] . O-Acetyl migration is believed to take place after glycoprotein sialylation. Carriers for CMP-Neu5Ac and AcCoA, as well as sialyltransferase, may be part of this complex. This model may be typical for mucin-producing cells, in contrast to lymphocyte homogenates, for example, where GD3 is O-acetylated at the best rate (unpublished data).",

In this way, the penultimate sugars of epithelia or mucins are unmasked by Sia removal, mostly galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine, which are distinct constituents of ligands for bacterial colonization other than Sia. Thus, O-acetyl groups on Sia hinder degradation of the mucinous defense barrier on epithelia by bacteria and colonization and thus eventual destruction of epithelia. This may be valid for human intestine, where the amount and O-acetylation of Sia increase from small intestine to colon [38] .",

Interestingly, they can only hydrolyze 4-or 9-O-acetyl groups at different rates, but not 7-O-acetyl residues. The reason for this hydrolytic resistance of 7-O-acetyl may be found in the three-dimensional structure of the O-acetylated glycans, as demonstrated by computer-aided modeling ( Fig. 28.4) . The statistically most frequent position of the 7-O-acetyl group is adjacent to the terminal Sia, while the 9-O-acetyl group is protruding. Correspondingly, the 7-O-acetyl group cannot bind to the catalytic center of the esterases, which is in contrast to the protruding 9-O-acetyl residue. Before hydrolysis, the 7-O-acetyl group has to migrate to C-9. In horse liver, two esterases were found that can hydrolyze only 4-O-acetyl esters and both 4-and 9-acetyls, respectively [15] .",

It was shown in human colon mucosa cells that the degree of O-acetylation depends on the ratio of the activities of both O-acetyltransferase and esterase and not on the activity of O-acetyltransferase alone [24] . Sialidases continue the degradation of sialylated glycoconjugates mainly in lysosomes (Neu1).

Also, many bacteria and viruses often produce large amounts of this enzyme [1, 2, [40] [41] [42] . Bacteria can use secreted sialidase to unmask penultimate sugars for binding to the host cells, or/and they consume liberated Sia for nutritional purposes.

Trypanosoma cruzi in South America and Trypanosoma brucei in Africa, the latter causing sleeping sickness transmitted by tsetse flies, express trans-sialidase, which has both sialidase and transferase activity [46] . Trypanosomes are coated with Sia by direct transfer of Sia from host glycoconjugates to Gal or GalNAc residues forming only a2,3-linkages, which protect the parasites from being well recognized by the host's immune system. O-Acetylation appreciably hinders this enzymatic transfer [47] , thus representing a defense system against trypanosomiasis. Indeed, N'dama cattle expressing O-acetylated Sia on erythrocytes are less prone to trypanosomal infection than Zebu cattle [48] .",

Tanaka et al. [61] reported desialylation of human low-density lipoproteins by radical reactions, although the mechanism was not explained. Since O-acetylation at C-9 strongly hinders oxidation with mild periodate concentrations of the Sia side chain when compared with the unsubstituted monosaccharide in vitro [18] , O-acetylation of this part of the Sia molecule may hinder premature destruction of the cell-protecting Sia layer by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo and thus the development of atherosclerosis. Sia lining the lumen of blood vessels were shown by histological means to be O-acetylated in rats [17, 37, 62] and thus support this assumption. The O-acetyl groups on endothelial cells could also influence receptor interactions. An unusually high concentration of Sia was observed on the surface of vascular endothelia of human, rabbit, and guinea pig, which was decided to be required for the repulsion of blood components [63] . On the other hand, unsubstituted or 4-or 7-O-acetylated Sia may serve as a scavenger of ROS.",

For example, by means of monoclonal antibodies, carbohydrate structures can now be analyzed in the steric context of intact cell surfaces. Some of these antibodies recognize even subtle differences in carbohydrate structures, e.g., O-acetylation at various positions. Since it became obvious that carbohydrate-specific monoclonal antibodies are not only useful for basic cell biological research but also for clinical use, some of them have been integrated into the cluster of differentiation (CD) system of monoclonal antibodies detecting cell surface molecules of leukocytes and cells involved in immune reactions [66] . Most of these CD antibody-defined carbohydrates can be subsumed under the term \"histo-blood group antigens.\" Monoclonal antibodies that are able to distinguish between GD3 and its 7-and 9-O-acetylated variants have been designated as CD60a (GD3), CD60b (9-O-acetyl GD3), and CD60c (7-O-acetyl-GD3) [67] . These antibodies became valuable tools for investigating their expression on lymphocytes. Interestingly, some of these structures are also often expressed on tumor cells.",

            "text": "In this section, we focus on the expression and functional impact of O-acetylated carbohydrates on leukocytes and immunity-related cells. Although O-acetylation can occur at various sites of the Sia molecule, from our observations, carbons 7 and 9 are prevalent for this modification in leukocytes. In most studies, it was found that the disialoganglioside GD3 is the major carrier of terminal O-acetylated Sia. Interestingly, GD3 itself has been described as a ganglioside involved in several reactions relevant for the immune system. In earlier in vitro studies, it was shown that gangliosides shed by tumors, such as GD3, inhibit activity of natural killer (NK) cells [68, 69] . In particular, it was speculated that the antitumor cytotoxicity of NK cells was blocked, thereby alleviating undisturbed tumor growth. This idea was later followed up when the new family of Sia-binding lectins, the siglecs, was established. Nicoll et al. [70] described that GD3 expressed on target cells can negatively modulate NK cell cytotoxicity by interacting with siglec-7 on NK cells, which has a preference for binding a2,8-linked disialic acids and seems to be one of the inhibitory NK cell receptors. This observation may have provided a straightforward explanation for a possible protective function of strong GD3 expression in melanoma [71] . However, on the other hand, GD3 expressed on melanoma cells can induce another class of cytotoxic cells, the NKT cells [72] . The fine specificity of GD3-reactive NKT cells is mediated by binding to CD1d, a molecule with a structure like the major histocompatibility antigens on T cells, and with a preference for carbohydrate antigens. This new result has to be compared with the in vivo situation of antimelanoma NK and NKT cell-mediated immunity. Possibly the balance between these two types of cytotoxic cells decides on the outcome of effective immune surveillance in patients with melanoma. Another mechanism to explain the immune escape of melanoma cells may be that GD3 seems able to impair dendritic cell differentiation from monocytes and may induce their apoptosis [73] . Thus, dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells for efficient T-cell cytotoxicity are missing. Moreover, the GD3-related maturating dendritic cells produced large amounts of the inhibitory cytokine interleukin IL-10 [73] . An open question is how O-acetylation of sialoglycans on tumor cells influences these immune responses. Unfortunately, our knowledge of this aspect is rather scant. Recently, Ravindranath et al. [74] found that, in one patient with melanoma, only metastatic lesions expressed the O-acetylated forms of GD2 and GD3, whereas the primary tumor expressed exclusively the non-O-acetylated gangliosides. In a profound study using a microtiter plate assay with influenza C viruses [71] , it was shown that primary melanoma from human skin in most cases expresses elevated levels of 9-O-acetylated GD3, at variable degrees. The same was observed in basalioma, where the expression of this antigen was up to 60-fold higher than in surrounding normal skin [75] . In breast carcinomas, the situation looks somehow more complex. In normal ducts and in benign lesions, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans were present in Golgi regions and at the plasma membrane as detected by reaction with a CD60b antibody; while in carcinomas of the breast, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans were distributed in the cytoplasm in a disorderly fashion [76] . Cell surface expression of CD60b structures was only observed in well-differentiated carcinomas, and overall expression decreased with progression of malignancy.",

In regards to carcinoma, the O-acetylation decreased from the primary colon carcinomas to their liver metastases, as was observed in mammary carcinomas. Similarly, in colon carcinoma, Sia esterification decreases during increase of malignancy [21] . It may be speculated that O-acetylation of sialyl Lewis x is a negative regulator of the metastasis process, considering that sialyl Lewis x is recognized by selectins of vascular endothelial cells.

That Sia-Oacetylation plays a protective role in bacterial colonization of the rumen can be delineated from the observation that bovine fetal submandibular gland expresses almost no O-acetylated Sia [79] .

Agonistic effects of CD60b and -c monoclonal antibodies on lymphocytic proliferation are in favor of involvement in activation processes [90, 93, 95 ]. An interesting observation was that T and B lymphocytes react to stimulation with CD60b and -c antibodies in a different way. In T lymphocytes, CD60c antibodies alone can stimulate proliferation. In B cells, additional signals such as IL-4 and triggering of the B-cell receptor are required. For stimulation with antibodies against CD60b, additional signals are needed in both lymphocyte classes [93] . This differential behavior may have a basis in different surface distribution of the antigens. While CD60b structures are found in dot-like formations, possibly as components of rafts in T and B cells, CD60c on T cells showed a more homogenous distribution on the cell surface [93] . It is most likely that CD60b is a costimulatory signal for raft-concentrated receptors, while CD60c in T cells acts as a mitogen. However, most types of leukocytes express raft-like cell surface structures that contain varying extents of either CD60b or -c or both O-acetylated glycans.",

            "text": "It has been known for some time that intracellular GD3 is involved in CD95-and ceramide-mediated apoptosis. Upon receptor triggering de novo, increased activity of GD3 synthase by synthesized GD3 accumulates intracellularly. GD3 normally restricted in its presence to the Golgi network and plasma membrane is transferred to mitochondria via endosomal transport [97] . Here, it is found in raft-like mitochondrial membrane domains [98] . The mechanisms of GD3-induced apoptosis can be traced back to a GD3-mediated increase of the production of ROS and a change in the mitochondrial membrane potential [99, 100] . O-Acetylation of GD3 suppresses this proapoptotic function of nonacetylated GD3 and does not have the deleterious effects on mitochondria membranes [101] . Cells that are resistant to overexpression of GD3 convert existing GD3 more readily to 9-O-acetylated GD3 [101] . Also, exogenous O-acetylated GD3 given to cells in vitro is internalized U5 ++ \u2212 +++ ++ Bone marrow cells were obtained from bone marrow aspirates and were isolated as described [93] . Biopsies were taken after having received patients' informed consent. The study was approved by the ethical board of the University of Heidelberg, Germany. CD34+ cells were identified by a CD34-specific monoclonal antibody in flow cytometry, and analysis of CD60 expression on CD34+ cells was further performed in multicolor flow cytometric analysis. Prior to cell surface staining, live cells were pretreated with enzymes as described below to define structural characteristics and possible protein carriers of the respective CD60 epitopes on cell surface-expressed glycoconjugates The results shown here are representative for several independent measurements on CD34+ cells of healthy donors as well as of patients suffering from CD34+ acute myeloblastic leukemia (Schwartz-Albiez; unpublished data) a Pretreatment of cells with sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (VCN) as described earlier [93] b Pretreatment of cells with recombinant sialate-9-O-acetylesterase (SOAE) of influenza C virus [96] ; this enzyme does not attack 7-O-acetylated Neu5Ac c Pretreatment of cells with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (OSGE), which degrades sialoglycoproteins of the mucin type, as positive control; successful degradation of surface-expressed CD45 on CD34+ cells was shown in flow cytometry d For evaluation of expression, both percentage of positive cells as well as fluorescent intensity per cell were considered and can prevent apoptosis [102] . It was also observed that an apoptosis-resistant variant of the T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat transferred GD3 into 9-O-acetyl GD3 [102] . Thus, it is most likely that high intracellular expression of 9-O-acetyl GD3 protects tumor cells from apoptosis. While data have been gathered on the antiapoptotic effect of 9-O-acetyl GD3, no data are available on possible effects of 7-O-acetyl GD3. We have observed that in T-and B-cell lines, 7-O-acetyl followed by 9-O-acetyl GD3 is present in an intracellular pool (unpublished data). Given that intracellular 9-O-acetyl GD3 confers antiapoptotic potential, can this protective effect possibly be accelerated by rapid conversion of 7-O-acetyl into 9-O-acetyl GD3? (It was described above that the primary insertion site of O-acetyls catalyzed by mammalian, including lymphocyte, Sia O-acetyltransferases is at C-7, from where it can isomerize to C-9.) We also have no knowledge of the mechanisms for transporting both acetylated forms of GD3 to the cell surface or of those with regard to the balance between the intracellular pool and cell surface expression of CD60b and -c, and what is decisive for regulation of either antiapoptotic or proliferative effects. First experiments showed that human tonsillar B lymphocytes undergoing either spontaneous or staurosporine-induced apoptosis, in vitro, are characterized by expression of CD60b on their surface, but not expression of CD60c [93] . It may be that O-acetylated gangliosides fulfill different tasks at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments.",
