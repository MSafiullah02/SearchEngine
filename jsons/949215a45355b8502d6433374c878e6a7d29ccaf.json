The incidence of serious infection in neutropenic patients increases with the depth, rapidity of onset, and duration of neutropenia. The risk of infection increases with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1,000 cells/mm 3 , and is significantly higher with an ANC < 500 cells/mm 3 . A rapid decline in ANC and duration of neutropenia > 7 -10 days are associated with an increase in serious, life-threatening infection. Likewise, morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with profound neutropenia (ANC < 100/mm 3 ) [1] [2] [3] .",

For example, the incidence of bacteremia due to Gram-negative bacilli in Japan decreased (40 % to 64 %) and infections due to Gram-positive bacteria increased (51 % to 24 %) in 1991 to 1996 compared to the prior 15 years [6] .
