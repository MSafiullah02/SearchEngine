Droplet inhalation into the respiratory tract and contact transmission through infected secretions are thought to be the chief routes of person to person transmission [2] . The potential for airborne transmission is still being studied [3] [4] [5] [6] , and if proven, will have a major impact on measures to reduce transmission as well as the need and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) [7] [8] [9] [10] . Patient respiratory activity and medical procedures such as intubation, bronchoscopy or respiratory tract suctioning are thought to generate aerosols that may remain airborne for some time and place healthcare workers at risk of infection. Otolaryngologists and anaesthetists in particular, perform these high risk aerosol generating procedures (AGP) which expose them to potential droplet, contact and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] , whether the patient is in a symptomatic or asymptomatic phase of the disease process.",

This requires actively taking time to pause and contemplate instances when respiratory secretions could be aerosolised and the area where they might linger, the surfaces that may be contaminated by droplets, and how to minimise these routes of transmission to healthcare workers.

Three AGP were undertaken prior to the formulation of the operative team checklist. Simulation was performed with a mannequin in the operating theatre using the example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for retrieval of an airway foreign body. Amendments to the checklist were made after performing 14 various high risk Otolaryngology AGP on paediatric and adult patients with unknown COVID-19 status (presumed positive). One of these cases was the emergency removal of a pistachio nut from a distal left main bronchus on a 16-month old child weighing 10.7kg that had been inhaled 6 days prior to presentation ( Figure 1 ). The child was COVID negative but managed as status unknown with full high risk AGP precautions to allow real life simulation and identification of areas for improvement.",

However, it is advisable that the surgeon and anaesthetist in charge confirm what they anticipate will be required for that specific procedure and not just rely on a pre-prepared list, to limit having to search for things outside the room once the procedure has commenced and to reduce wastage of unused items that will be deemed contaminated. Detailing the need not only for surgical hardware but other specific items such as size and types of syringes (e.g. luer lock), sizes of flexible forceps, topical medications, microbiology swabs, sputum traps and specimen containers with patient labels available can be helpful beforehand to streamline the execution of AGP and allow the focus to be maintained on minimising aerosolisation.",

Bluetooth headsets worn under PAPR may be an option if they are able to be inclusive for enough critical staff and be cleaned appropriately. Theatre phones, intercoms and walkie talkie devices if being used should be checked to be functional beforehand.

If a face mask is used, excessive positive pressure is avoided however gentle support may be required to avoid atelectasis and alveolar derecruitment. The best airway seal will be obtained by inflating the cuff of an endotracheal tube but this may not always be appropriate or available depending on the size of the child or the condition being treated (e.g. child with croup, subglottic stenosis or proximal airway foreign body). Flexible bronchoscopy can be useful for a diagnostic assessment, however, it is generally a less familiar approach, ventilation can be obstructed by the presence of the scope in an endotracheal tube, the scope may be too big for a small child, the working channel is smaller and longer limiting therapeutic instrumentation available, it may be harder to manipulate and maintain coverage under the plastic drapes and the image quality may be inferior to the rigid telescope. Final smooth withdrawal of an airway foreign body using flexible forceps may be hampered by the size of the material and the holding strength of the forceps. Flexible endoscopy forceps that are small enough to fit through working channels are usually designed for taking biopsies and may break an organic foreign body into smaller pieces necessitating multiple passes for complete retrieval.",

To avoid close direct visualisation and suction through a rigid bronchoscope, the use of a glass window plug, flexible suction catheter and endoscopy forceps through the working channel can help if other endoscopic equipment is not available or suitable but may have its limitations. There will however, be circumstances where having an open airway is unavoidable such as retrieval of a laryngeal foreign body. Suction in this situation should be minimised as much as possible. With all airway manipulation, nursing staff and/or surgical assistants need to occlude suction tubing and only release it when signalled. Similarly, the anaesthetic team should communicate with each other when to stop gas flows during periods when the rigid bronchoscope or other airway devices are being inserted or withdrawn.Alternatively, flexible bronchoscopy can be employed via a LMA or endotracheal tube via selfsealing adaptors to reduce aerosol exposure for staff. The LMA does not provide a complete seal but may be a better alternative to an open airway in situations where avoiding intubation is preferable.",
