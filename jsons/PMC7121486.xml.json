By state capacity, this book means the willingness of member states to utilise their , , and institutional power resources in terms of governance capacity to lead regional initiatives. This involves the state\u2019s utilisation of tangible, intangible, and institutional power resources in order for a state or a combination of states to be able to effectively lead regional initiatives. This book argues that tangible resources such as economic advantage, size of a country, administrative machinery, and military capabilities, as well as intangible resources such as foreign policy, political system, and culture provide advantages for a particular state to play leadership roles in regional community-building efforts. Furthermore, institutional power resources can also provide more leverage for a state to exert influence in the development of regional community-building. Therefore, this book argues that state capacity is crucial in the provision of regional political leadership as it helps to sustain the benefits of regional integration and to continuously build and strengthen regional community-building through policy implementation and policy continuity. Conversely, the lack of such capacity can impede the progress of regional community-building efforts.",

The first section surveys the scholarly literature on state capacity, which includes tangible, intangible, and institutional power resources, and its importance for exercising leadership role. The second section examines the degree to which state capacity (or the lack thereof) offers advantages or challenges for a particular ASEAN member state to provide leadership and how this affects the development of the ASEAN Community. The final section assesses the relationship between state capacity and leadership in the EU context, and the degree to which state capacity has influenced its member states\u2019 behaviour to exert more influence in the EU.",

Scholars such as Fawcett (2005, 2013) and Zwartjes et al. (2012) explain the importance of state capacity for a particular state to be considered as, and to act in the manner of, a leader. For Fawcett (2005), regional community-building is about accomplishing regional integration objectives. For potential leaders to be able to make decisions, provide solutions to overcome deadlocks, or to act as the driver for other member states, access to state resources is advantageous.",

These material resources include economic strength, population size, territory, military capabilities, political stability, and administrative capacity. A state with a large economy will be able to lead smaller states by bearing the cost of regional integration disproportionately, a role that Mattli (1999a, p. 16) describes as the \u2018regional paymaster\u2019\u2014a role that has been performed by Germany in the European context, for example. Additionally, a state\u2019s economic strength acts as an advantage for the state to be a core provider of collective goods to other member states, such as through the creation of regional institutions to help states cooperate with each other (Genna and Hiroi 2007, p. 54).",

The number of civil servants, or, in the external context, the size of diplomatic corps, is one indicator of this capacity. The human capital of the bureaucracy, which includes the practical skills of the administrative staff required to manage the states efficiently, is also vital (Thorhallsson 2006, p. 19). The presence of administrative capacity with well-trained bureaucrats is advantageous for a state to exercise leadership in a regional body, especially within the areas of policymaking and the implementation process (Archer and Nugent 2006, p. 3). For example, the commitment and the willingness of the larger states in Europe, such as France and Germany, to utilise their administrative capacity have enabled them to promote new policies and ensure the implementation of their proposed agenda (Tallberg 2008).",

In this regard, Emmers (2011) argued that \u2018being the largest country obviously has a lot of influence\u2019. However, many scholars have also recognised the leadership roles of small states in region-building (Acharya 2008; Bunse 2009; Lee 2006; Nugent 2010). For instance, Singapore\u2014the smallest state in ASEAN\u2014champions ASEAN\u2019s economic integration through various economic policies and initiatives to help reduce the gaps among ASEAN member states (Severino 2006, p. 29). Thus, while the size of the state might be important to be perceived as the \u2018natural leader\u2019, such as in the case of Indonesia in ASEAN, the correlation between a state\u2019s size and the extent to which it can play a leadership role in region-building is difficult to establish. This is because the size of a state is not a sufficient condition for leadership. Rather, leadership requires more elements of state capacity, such as strong administrative capacity with quality bureaucrats and technocrats.",

In a regional organisational context, the manner in which a state acts to achieve its foreign policy goals, to a large extent, impacts substantially on its capacity to be a leader in the development of regional integration projects. For example, Indonesia\u2019s proactive foreign policy in the promotion of human rights and democracy, as a reflection of its post-Suharto political values, has increased its leadership capacity as the leader of ASEAN (Emmers 2014; Laksamana 2011).",

These coalitions can shift, depending on the issue at hand, as seen in the EU. It can also be in the form of sectoral leadership, where a particular state champions the promotion and implementation of a specific issue in regional community-building, as seen in ASEAN, with Indonesia championing regional integration on political and security issues and Singapore promoting and facilitating economic integration in ASEAN. Therefore, it is the behaviour of states that are able and willing to lead that will be examined in this chapter.

Indonesia, however, decided to reject the invitation (Berita Harian\n1966). According to Chaidir Anwar Sani, an assistant to Indonesia\u2019s then foreign minister Adam Malik, and a member of the official delegation to Bangkok in 1967, one of the reasons for its rejection was because of its size (Anwar 1994, p. 50). As the largest and the most populous state in the region,1 Indonesia, according to Chaidir Anwar Sani, was too proud to become a junior member of the Association (Anwar 1994, p. 50). What Indonesia did instead was propose a new regional association in which all members would have equal status and rights, to be known as Southeast Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SEAARC) in 1966 (Anwar 1994, p. 50; Murphy 2002, p. 320). It was a modest proposal, without a clearly formulated conceptual framework, as Indonesian officials feared that an ambitious proposal would be seen as an indication of Indonesian hegemony (Anwar 1994, p. 51). Indonesia\u2019s inclination to propose a new regional organisation illustrated Indonesia\u2019s ability and willingness to participate in and lead the new regional organisation in the 1960s.",

Furthermore, as a founder of ASA, Tunku Abdul Rahman was reluctant to see the ASA scrapped for a new regional body in order to incorporate Indonesia (The Straits Times\n1967b). Singapore\u2019s major concern was with the broad framework of the proposal, as it did not offer any \u2018concrete benefits\u2019 for the members. It thus felt that meetings to further discuss this endeavour \u2018would be wasting our time\u2019 (Phanit 1980, p. 35). The Philippines opposed the SEAARC, especially relating to the extent to which great power influences should be excluded, and how that might be accomplished.2 Thailand, however, was the only country that supported Indonesia without any major reservations for two main reasons. First, Thailand felt vulnerable to the conflicts of its neighbours: Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia (Severino 2006, p. 2). Second, Thailand realised that it should never become too dependent on any single large power\u2014especially the US, as a result of the growing military relationships between Thailand and the US from early 1960 up to 1970 (Phanit 1980, p. 34). Therefore, regional cooperation was seen by Thailand as a potential alternative to reduce its dependence on any single major power.",

Thanat believed that the most important issue in the search for a regional organisation in Southeast Asia was to secure Indonesian participation in the new organisation (Murphy 2002, p. 317). Likewise, in contrast to Tunku Abdul Rahman, Abdul Razak, the then foreign minister of Malaysia, shared Thanat\u2019s view that the key to a successful regional organisation was the participation of the biggest state in the region\u2014Indonesia (Murphy 2002, p. 326).

To cement the intra-ASEAN relationship, Indonesia made several confidence-building gestures through closer regional cooperation in areas of mutual concern, such as the threat of communism and the reduction of great power competition in the region (Antolik 1990, p. 20). Indonesia focused on attempts to control the communist threat in Borneo and to strengthen its relationship with Malaysia (Antolik 1990, p. 20). In March 1968, Malik assured Lee Kuan Yew that Indonesia was ready to protect Singapore against the communists after the British withdrew in 1971, stating that \u2018[w]e shall protect them (200 million of ASEAN) even if the threat comes from Genghis Khan\u2019 (Adam Malik cited in Lee Kuan Yew 2000, p. 297). This helped to improve relations and mitigate suspicions among Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.",

In November 1985, Indonesia offered to host an informal \u2018cocktail party\u2019 for all warring Cambodian factions. Consequently, on 29 July 1987, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Tach convened an informal meeting in which they agreed that all Cambodian factions should be brought together to find a peaceful solution. This led to the First and Second Jakarta Informal Meetings on Cambodia in July 1988 and February 1989, respectively. Indonesia, co-chairing with France, convened the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which was held in two sessions: the first from 30 July to 30 August 1989, and the second from 21 to 23 October 1991 (United Nations 1991). Although the conference did not have any substantial outcome (Caballero-Anthony 2005), it displayed Indonesia\u2019s capacity to coordinate the peace negotiation process.",

Indonesia\u2019s limited national capacity, such as a low level of economic growth, and the past inability of Suharto and his top ministers to project the ideas of economic integration hindered Indonesia\u2019s leadership on economic integration since the early days of ASEAN, even if \u2018Indonesia wanted to do so\u2019 (Anwar 1994, p. 49). Lee Kuan Yew (2000, p. 371) wrote in his memoir that Suharto \u2018spoke only Bahasa Indonesia and could not engage in a free exchange in English. He preferred bilateral meetings. Then he would speak with animation and vigour in Bahasa Indonesia and, in the late 1980s use English words and phrases to get his ideas across\u2019. Lee Kuan Yew (2000, p. 329) further added that \u2018[t]he Dutch had not left many trained Indonesian administrators and professionals; there were few institutions that could carry the country forward, and three and half years of Japanese occupation had wrecked whatever administration there was\u2019. To date, the Indonesian bureaucracy is still staffed by incompetent civil servants and at the same time suffers from corruption (Parlina 2015; Prasojo 2012). The problems of Indonesia\u2019s bureaucracy and bureaucrats, according to the former President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (cited in Lukito 2012), \u2018provide obstacles to Indonesian economic growth\u2019. (cited in Lukito 2012). The lack of state capacity in this regard has prevented Indonesia from playing a leadership role in the economic sphere, forcing it to focus on its areas of strength\u2014political and security areas.",

Due to its economic disadvantages, Indonesia opted to be a \u2018non-decision\u2019 leader in matters concerning economic integration. Indonesia took the position of either not doing anything or purposely delaying the economic integration process (Narjoko 2014). For example, because of Indonesia\u2019s economic weaknesses, the government long resisted proposals for intra-ASEAN trade liberalisation, as it was perceived that this would disadvantage Indonesia. The absence of any substantial moves towards trade liberalisation until the early 1990s is evidence of this (Anwar 2006, p. 26).",

Singapore lobbied for the establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) as early as 1970s (Rau 1981, p. 108). This proposal was, however, rejected by other ASEAN member states due to their \u2018inward-looking\u2019 economies. Singapore, at this stage, had to compromise with other ASEAN colleagues who preferred \u2018inward-looking\u2019 economies, which focused on meeting the needs of their rural population (Rau 1981, p. 105). Nonetheless, with Singapore continuing to advance an agenda for closer economic integration, the ASEAN Preferential Trading Agreement (PTA) was signed at the 2nd ASEAN Summit in 1977 in Kuala Lumpur, whereby each ASEAN country agreed to tariff reductions on imports tariff from other member countries.",

Since then, almost all major economic initiatives in ASEAN have come from Singapore, through utilising its state capacity. Singapore\u2019s strategic relationship with major powers such as the US, China, and the EU, and its close trade relationship with major economies such as Australia, China, Japan, and Korea through Free Trade Agreements (FTA), encouraged it to initiate the ASEAN-India Summit, the Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation, and a proposal for a free trade area between ASEAN and China. The close relationship between Singapore and France, as well as Germany, also led to the establishment of Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) (Camroux 2006, p. 5; Robles 2007, p. 1). Furthermore, as Singapore has been playing an increasingly active role in multilateral groupings such as ASEM, its Foreign Affairs Ministry has recruited better-qualified officials to join it ranks to enhance the capacity of its officials. The candidates, among other requirements, must have at least five-years of working experience, be intellectually able and resourceful, and have management skills and integrity (Mien 1996). Indeed, based on a survey conducted in 2012, entitled \u2018Bureaucracy: Asia\u2019s Best and Worst\u2019, Singapore\u2019s civil service ranked top among 12 Asian economies, being least encumbered by red tape and the concentration of power of its administration (Rahman 2013). In this regard, excellent foreign ministry officers and diplomats have provided insightful recommendations and assist the foreign minister and his cabinet colleagues in order for Singapore to be able to discern future trends in the international political, security, and economic environment (Lee 2009). This allows Singapore to provide \u2018intellectual leadership\u2019 (Young 1991) in promoting new agendas and sustaining the benefits of an ASEAN Community.",

Although Singapore does not play the role of a \u2018regional paymaster\u2019, it has demonstrated a full commitment to reduce the apparent gap in the level of economic development among ASEAN members by utilising its strong economy. Singapore, under a five-year technical assistance programme of the IAI, offered several training institutes in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, providing IT \u2018Train-the-Trainers\u2019 courses, for instance. Singapore also increased the number of existing Singaporean scholarships given to ASEAN nationals (ASEAN Secretariat 2000). In 2004, Singapore contributed an additional $SGD28.9 million ($US17.6 million) to support the implementation of the IAI as an important symbol of its commitment to foster closer economic integration and enhance ASEAN\u2019s competitiveness as a region (Singapore Cooperation Programme 2011). At the 13th ASEAN Summit in 2007, Singapore reaffirmed its continued commitment to the IAI by pledging another $SGD30 million to cover technical assistance projects from 2009 to 2011 (ASEAN Secretariat 2007). At the 19th ASEAN Summit in Bali in November 2011, Singapore allocated a further contribution of $SGD50 million from 2012 to 2015, bringing Singapore\u2019s total commitment to the IAI to S$168.4 million (Singapore Cooperation Programme 2011). Singapore\u2019s contribution exceeds the other ASEAN member states\u2019 contribution in this regard. For example, in 2008, Singapore contributed approximately $US84 million, while Thailand and Malaysia contributed approximately $US12 million and $US57 million, respectively (McGillivray and Carpenter 2013, p. 145). In addition, Singapore is also a major contributor to numerous IAI projects in accordance with ASEAN Community Blueprint (see Table 4.1).",

The study, which was undertaken by McKinsey & Co, found that ASEAN had lost its competitive edge in terms of labour costs to China. Furthermore, China had overtaken ASEAN as the world\u2019s prime location for Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) (Hew 2007, p. 2). Following the report\u2019s findings, Singapore proposed an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) as the next stage of ASEAN\u2019s regional economic integration. The proposal was adopted by the Summit in 2003 and incorporated in the Bali Concord II. Singapore continues to play a leading role in promoting the economic integration of ASEAN. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his speech at the 25th ASEAN Summit in Myanmar, expressed his optimism on the AEC and the benefits it will bring to the region when he stated that \u2018[a]n ASEAN that is economically integrated, strong and united can better attract investments, create jobs, manage regional challenges, as well as be an effective platform to engage larger powers\u2019 (Loh 2014).",

This is why Singapore actively builds coalition with other member states, especially Thailand, to exert influence in the region (Dent 2006). It has been able to convince Indonesia to assume a leading role in ASEAN (Priyambodo 2012). Of course, Singapore has developed bilateral relationships with other ASEAN member countries including the Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV) states, which are the beneficiaries of Singapore\u2019s capability-sharing programmes such as technology transfer programme (Wong et al. 2009, pp. 55\u201356). However, the Singapore-Thailand relationship is unique in the sense that the two states have been able to influence and determine the progress of ASEAN economic integration through, first, a shared vision on the establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community, and, second, through a convergence of economic interests.",

Goh paid a visit to Prime Minister Anand in 1991, and the seed of AFTA was sown after that (Tang 1997). As expected, Anand (who had been a successful businessman and therefore understood the importance of an integrated economy and trade in the region in facing the challenges of globalisation and regionalism) took the leading role successfully (Lee 2000, p. 382).

Shanmugam raised the need for Indonesia and Singapore to lead the push for the ASEAN member countries to negotiate and support a Code of Conduct (COC)4 on the long-running South China Sea dispute (Priyambodo 2012).",

Singapore has attempted to convince Indonesia of the benefits of having greater cooperation in the economic sphere since the 1970s. As Lee Kuan Yew (2000, p. 370) recalled, \u2018at bilateral meeting with Suharto in Bali in September in 1975, I tried to persuade him to agree to set economic targets for ASEAN at its first summit, which Indonesia should host\u2019. However, Ali Mortopo, Suharto\u2019s close aide, later told K. C. Lee (then Singapore\u2019s ambassador) that after the meeting between Suharto and Lee Kuan Yew, Suharto\u2019s technocrats had advised him against free trade because of their fears that Indonesia would become a dumping ground for the goods of other ASEAN countries (Lee 2000, p. 370). Although Singapore remains very keen to promote an open and integrated regional economy, Indonesia remains rather reluctant to open its market. Hence, this helps explain the reliance on the Singapore-Thailand coalition for setting the pace of ASEAN economic integration rather than the Singapore-Indonesia coalition, where divergence of visions and interest between the two on this issue exists.",

France, even though relatively weaker than Germany in terms of economic power, was, for a long time, a leading EU economy, only second to Germany. With Germany defeated, divided, and occupied, it was natural to assume a Franco-British coalition at the core of European integration (O\u2019Donnell 2011; Valant and Curie 2012). However, France and the UK were in very different positions at the end of the Second World War. Britain showed a lack of enthusiasm for the idea of European integration given its political culture that emphasised national sovereignty, its history of only occasional direct involvement in continental European affairs, and its special wartime experience of having escaped invasion (Dinan 2010, p. 25). France, in contrast, opted for regional integration through reconciliation with its closest neighbour and biggest enemy, West Germany, for two main reasons. First, to avoid a repetition of the disastrous war, and, second, to sustain France\u2019s survivability and being able to co-exist with its closest neighbour\u2014Germany (Dinan 2010, p. 25). The different positions between France and Britain at the end of the Second World War impeded the two countries in taking the lead of European integration.",

French and German willingness to commit to the vision of European integration was manifested in the signing of the Treaty of Paris. Britain, in contrast, excluded itself from the discussions, leading to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), as it was unwilling to sign prior to the start of negotiations, a communiqu\u00e9 with other governments agreeing in advance to the \u2018pooling of coal and steel production\u2019 and accepting the transfer of national control to a High Authority (Dedman 1996, p. 64).",

After Second World War, France was a \u2018political giant and economic dwarf\u2019, while Germany was an \u2018economic giant and political dwarf\u2019 (Guerot and Leonard 2011). Germany was (and remains) the biggest economy in the EU since the initiation of European integration. Indeed, in the first half of 2013, Germany reported a budget surplus of 16.1 billion euros (12.76 billion pounds) or 1.1 per cent of the GDP (The Wall Street Journal\n2014). This provided advantage for Germany to exert influence on European integration together with France, which had political advantage at that time. Germany cooperated closely with France to push forward initiatives, finance the EU eastern enlargement, support small member states, strengthen the European Commission and the European Parliament (EP), and pay for compromises without demanding political representation to reflect its disproportionate financial contributions (Guerot 2003, pp. 46\u201347; Janning 2005, p. 829).",

Germany is the biggest net contributor to the EU, followed by France, with Britain ranking third (Haas and Rubio 2017). With the Britain\u2019s decision to exit the Union, request for Germany to contribute more to the EU\u2019s budget is expressed publicly. For example, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, European Union Budget Commissioner, requested Germany to contribute about \u20ac3 billion to 3.5 billion ($3.76 billion to 4.4 billion) more to the EU than it does now to help meet new challenges facing the Union (Reuters\n2017). This is to cover the Britain\u2019s net contribution valued approximately \u20ac9 billion ($10.12 billion). In response to the demand, Germany has signalled its willingness to contribute more than it has in the past (Coalition Agreement 2018, p. 13). German Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Martin Schulz reinstated Germany\u2019s commitment to European integration as stated in their Coalition Agreement (2018, p. 13): \u2018We are prepared for Germany to make higher contributions to the EU budget.

The notions of the concours and the cabinets in the EU, for examples, are from France\u2019s influence (Drake 2006, p. 92). The term concours means a public contest or competition, and in the EU context, it refers to a recruitment competition and examination to select staff of all institutions of the EU. The term Cabinets literally means offices, and in the EU context, the term refers to a group of important advisors to a president, a minister, or a commissioner.",

Although the establishment of both the supranational and intergovernmental institutions was seen as a means to guarantee a fair balance between big and small states (Bunse and Nicolaidis 2012, p. 251), in some institutions such as the Commission and the Council of the EU, a larger state often, although not always the case, has more leverage to influence the decision-making processes of the EU. Nugent (1999, p. 472) argues that there are many channels in which the government can try to persuade, influence, or bring pressure to the Commission. In so doing, the government can utilise \u2018formal channels such as the group of experts who advise the Commission on all sorts of matters, the management and regulatory committees through which the Commission exercises many of its executive functions, and the numerous decision-making meetings that take place within the Council system from working party levels upward\u2014meetings which the Commission always attends\u2019 (Nugent 1999, p. 472). The utilisation of these channels, however, depends upon the domestic policies, administrative capacity, as well as the qualities of the diplomats, officials, and negotiators of a particular government. Also, well-staffed administrative infrastructure with expertise, clear responsibilities, and coordination procedures, which are enjoyed by larger states such as France and Germany, allows these countries to produce effective bargaining, especially at supranational level of the EU\u2019s institution such as the European Commission (Kutys 2009, p. 7). Further, larger member states have the financial capacity to engage in additional negotiation strategies and therefore to be overall more active than smaller member-states. This gives advantage to large member states such as France and Germany, as they are able to draw on their financial strength and large administrative machinery when preparing proposals, developing and offering EU training, and creating expert groups.",

In this regard, where a vote is needed, the larger member states, especially France and Germany, are always likely to carry more voting weightage than smaller countries such as Portugal and Luxembourg (McCormick 2011, p. 195). Under this Qualified Majority Vote (QMV) arrangement, \u2018each member state representative has a certain number of votes, as set out in the EU treaties. The weighting votes roughly reflect the size of population of each member states\u2019 (Consilium 2015) (see Table 4.2). What\u2019s more, from 1 November 2014, a QMV will require a double majority to adopt proposals: decisions in the Council will need the support of 55 per cent of member states, and these member states at the same time represent 65 per cent of the EU population (Article 9(c) Treaty of Lisbon). The new system of QMV focuses on the demographic weightage of the member states. Therefore, the strength of the three largest member states of the EU\u2014France and Germany along with Italy\u2014in the shaping of agenda, brokering compromises, and building coalition either to support or blocking particular agenda is reinforced (Poptcheva and Devaney 2014) (Fig. 4.2).",

For example, throughout the 1990s, there were some serious divisions between France and Germany. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty almost failed to be ratified due to the French public\u2019s dissatisfaction with European integration (Wunderlich 2007, p. 98). Moreover, France became a difficult partner with regard to the 2004 eastern enlargement\u2014a project that France viewed as a German goal, and for which it was not willing to commit (Cole 2008, p. 152). There were also disagreements on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), budgetary provisions, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay round, and structural funds, among others (Cole 2008, p. 154). It was during the Treaty of Nice in 2000 that the Franco-German tandem was shaken to the core (Cole 2008; Janning 2005). This marked the first time when there was no joint letter preceding the Summit. The basis for this was the different positions that France and Germany had on the role of the Council. Germany requested more votes in the Council to take into consideration its larger population. France and other member states, including the UK, rejected the request based on the grounds that Germany had already received more seats in the European Parliament in 1992 to compensate for its larger population (Cole 2008, p. 154). These instances demonstrate that without strong Franco-German mutual commitment, the development of the EU and the process of regional community-building are weakened.",

In late June 2015, Athens submitted a revised reform plan to the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF). This was because Greece\u2019s previous arrangement with European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), namely, the Greek Master Financial Assistance Agreement (MFAA), expired on 30 June 2015\u2014the very same day that Greece defaulted on a $1.7 billion IMF repayment (de Finance et al. 2015). France and Germany, however, had divergent views on whether or not Greece was entitled to a third bailout. Germany demanded stringent reform and austerity measures from Athens, while France was supportive of Greece\u2019s request for further aid. The diverging views meant that a compromise between the Eurozone leaders, France and Germany, was hard to achieve, and therefore had the potential to lead to the break-up of European Monetary Union, the EU\u2019s most ambitious project (Taylor 2015). After long and tough negotiations, including the threat from European leaders together with the European Commission of the likelihood of the withdrawal of the Greek from the Eurozone, Donald Tusk, the Chair of the Euro Summit and President of the European Council, announced on 12 July 2015 that \u2018[l]eaders have agreed in principle that they are ready to start negotiations on an ESM [European Stability Mechanism] programme, which in other words means continued support for Greece\u2019 (cited in General Secretariat of the Council 2015). Thanks to Merkel\u2019s assertiveness and her firm stance, Greece was allowed to negotiate a new deal to prevent its exit (Grexit) from the Euro\u2014a recommendation that was also supported by her former Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. As Merkel believed that the so-called Grexit might undermine the entire currency union, she stated that \u2018[w]e would be grossly negligent, and act irresponsibly, if we didn\u2019t at least attempt this way [to negotiate with Greece]\u2019 (cited in ABC\n2015).",

As a result, Europe has struggled to respond to worsening migrant crisis (Tessa 2015).

Second, there is a growing divergence in approaches to respond to prevailing challenges as aforementioned issues. One of the main reasons for this is related to France\u2019s weakening economy, and, in comparison, to Germany\u2019s economy. While Germany continues to hold more bargaining chips due to its larger economic and more robust finances, the French economy is weakening. France\u2019s current debt, deficit and growth, and lack of a clear strategy under both Sarkozy and Hollande, undermine its capacity for European (joint) leadership (Clift and Ryner 2014, p. 150; Matthijs 2016, p. 137). This has changed the dynamics between France, which once was perceived to lead in political terms, and Germany, which was stronger in the economic sphere, which worked as a stabilising feature of the duo (The Economist\n2013).",

Smaller member states, in contrast, do not have the budgetary or personnel resources that are available to larger states (Nugent 2006, pp. 58\u201359). Furthermore, they do not have the resources to cover all policy areas under EU competence\u2014from agriculture to fishing, from working directives to food colouring and food preparation\u2014and therefore have to decide on priority areas (Archer and Nugent 2006, p. 4).

In so doing, Belgium invested substantially in a good working relationship with the European Commission and European President by utilising the trialogues\u2014the informal negotiations between the Council of Ministers, represented by the rotating president, the EU Commission, and the EP (Van Hecke and Bursens 2011, p. 5).

            "text": "The formation of coalitions is another strategy, which smaller states have used to influence EU decision-making, both at pre- and post-Lisbon. In the EU, there are shifting coalitions among member states, depending on the issues. In this setting, it is important to take into account that all member states are equal, but some are more important than others (Rood 2009, p. 67). This applies in particular to the big member states, specifically France and Germany, whose support is crucial for the formation of a winning coalition (Rood 2009, p. 68). Furthermore, the success of the coalition depends on the issue around which the coalition is formed. The Netherlands, for example, has devoted time and effort to champion efforts to influence economic and monetary union (Maes and Verdun 2005). The Netherlands, as a trading nation with a very open and outward-looking economy, has always been a supporter of European economic integration (Rood 2009, p. 68). It has close working relations with the Commission, the EU\u2019s bigger member states (France, German, and the UK), and member states that have taken a leading role in economic cooperation such as Belgium (Maes and Verdun 2005, p. 342). The Netherlands was an important ally of Germany in its push for ensuring that macro-economic integration was well developed before moving towards deeper monetary integration (Maes and Verdun 2005, p. 330). The Netherlands collaborated with Belgium in the area of monetary policymaking, and contributed to the European integration process, although their strategies differed6 (Maes and Verdun 2005, p. 343). The Netherlands, in the 1970s and the 1980s, played the role of a \u2018gate-keeper\u2019 in seeking consensus, especially between the Dutch and the British, with more restrictive view on the conditions under which EMU was possible (Maes and Verdun 2005, p. 344). Likewise, once the EMU was accepted, the Netherlands was firm on the interpretation of the criteria for entry, which can be seen in its attitude to the inclusion of countries such as Italy in the third stage of EMU (Maes and Verdun 2005, p. 26). This shows that coalitions based on the specific issues represent an alternative strategy for smaller member states to punch above their weight.",

However, there are sectoral leaderships and coalition leaderships among ASEAN members that have influenced the development of ASEAN\u2019s regional community-building efforts. In this regard, Singapore has been an active coalition-builder, seeking to form coalitions with other member states such as Thailand and Indonesia in search of more influence in ASEAN agenda-setting. With regard to sectoral leadership, Singapore has been the champion of ASEAN economic integration, along with Malaysia and Thailand, while Indonesia has led in security and political integration. This chapter found that sectoral leadership and coalition leadership are strategies, which ASEAN member states use to play more influential roles in ASEAN through maximising their state resources. Likewise, such coalition leadership is also evident in the EU. It is a strategy that smaller member states such as the Nordic and Benelux countries have used to influence the policymaking of the EU. Due to their relative size, a coalition with other states enables these member states to punch above their weight within the EU. Nevertheless, the findings of this research suggest that the main reason for ASEAN and EU member states to exert influence on specific issues is not primarily to maintain the benefits of regional integration. Rather, their active roles are driven by the necessity to protect their national interests.",

            "text": "Institutional power resources also constitute sources of state capacity in leadership roles. ASEAN has very few resources in this regard because of its heavy emphasis on intergovernmental cooperation. As such, ASEAN does not have supranational power resources, but the ASEAN Summit has been utilised by ASEAN member states for setting the agenda of ASEAN for at least the year in which they hold the Chairmanship. Chapter 10.1007/978-981-13-7976-5_6 will further examine ASEAN Summit and leadership in ASEAN. Likewise, institutional power resources of the EU such as the Commission, the Council, and the Presidency of the Council provide advantage for its members to exert increased influence. This is particularly evident when a state holds the Presidency of the Council. In this sense, the Presidency can exercise influence by contributing its own preferences to the agenda, attributing varying weights to agenda items, and keeping certain issues away from the agenda.",

            "text": "The important point that this chapter makes is that there is a correlation between state capacity and the function of leadership in ASEAN and the EU contexts. In this regard, major initiatives and agenda-settings are promoted and decided by the member states that are capable of doing so. Nevertheless, this chapter has also found that state capacity is necessary, but not a sufficient condition for playing a leadership role, both in ASEAN and the EU. Indeed, it is mainly based on the mutual commitment of the Franco-German alliance in the EU, and Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand in ASEAN, that the benefits of the EU and ASEAN regional community-building can be maintained by maximising their state capacity. Additionally, this conclusion is also influenced by Britain\u2019s reticence to promote the European regional project, despite its advantage in terms of its economic size (Guerot 2003). In 2013, Britain had considered leaving the Union (Cameron 2013). On 23 June 2016, Britain opted to exit the Union. Similarly, there has been an expectation from a number of ASEAN leaders, including Singapore\u2019s former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, that due to Indonesia\u2019s size, it should play a more assertive leadership role in the AEC. Indonesia, however, has considered not supporting the AEC if its economic interests are threatened (Parameswaran 2014; Kosasih 2015). Ultimately, the functions of leadership can only be demonstrated if the member states are willing to marshal their state capacity to support regional community-building projects.",

What is the basis for the acceptance of their leadership by other member states? Why is Indonesia recognised as the de facto leader in ASEAN? Under what conditions has Indonesia been, and might be, expected by other member states to play a more assertive leadership roles in ASEAN?
