However, both essential oils and monoterpenes exhibited high anti-HSV-1 activity by direct inactivation of free virus particles. All tested drugs interacted in a dose-dependent manner with herpesvirus particles thereby inactivating viral infection. Among the analysed compounds, monoterpene hydrocarbons were slightly superior to monoterpene alcohols in their antiviral activity, a-pinene and a-terpineol revealed the highest selectivity index.

HSV infects and replicates in cells at the site of entry, the mucocutaneous surface. After the acute ganglionic infection subsides, HSV establishes latency and persists in the neurons for the life-time. The latent virus is reactivated spontaneously causing frequent recurrent infections in some patients, while most people experience few recurrences. HSV-1 infections are very common and reactivations mostly affect adult people (Whitley and Roizman, 2001) . The primary symptoms of herpes infection include a prodromal fl u-like syndrome with fever, headache, malaise, diffuse myalgias, followed by local symptoms consisting of itching and painful papules. Gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis are the most frequent clinical manifestations of the fi rst episodes of HSV-1 infection.

Cell monolayers were grown in medium containing different concentrations of these drugs. After 3 days of incubation, the cell viability of RC-37 cells was determined with the neutral red assay (Table 1 ). The maximum noncytotoxic concentrations of these drugs were determined between 20 \u03bcg/mL for citral and 1250 \u03bcg/mL for 1,8-cineole, the least toxic compound tested. Essential oils and monoterpenes revealed low cytotoxicity. The potential antiviral effect of different essential oils and some selected components was determined against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in vitro. HSV-1 was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with various concentrations of eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, thyme oil, \u03b1-terpinene, \u03b3-terpinene, \u03b1-pinene, p-cymene, terpinen-4-ol, \u03b1-terpineol, thymol, citral and 1.8-cineole.

The results are presented as virus reduction and represent the average of three independent experiments. In plaque reduction assays, all essential oils and monoterpenes exhibited a concentration-dependent antiviral effect, tea tree oil was the most effective drug. All essential oils were able to suppress viral multiplication by >96% (Table 2) , all monoterpenes inhibited HSV by >80%, with the exception of the less active 1,8-cineole. In Table 2 , the results for up to 100 \u03bcg/mL are shown, for some monoterpenes with maximum noncytotoxic concentrations beyond 100 \u03bcg/mL the data are not shown. Selectivity indices for oils and different monoterpenes were calculated as the TC 50 /IC 50 ratio (Table 3) , the highest selectivity index of 60 was determined for tea tree oil. Low selectivity indices were found for eucalyptus oil, thyme oil and most monoterpenes. Herpesvirus replication is characterized by a complex sequence of different steps at which antiviral agents might interfere. In order to investigate the inhibitory effects on herpes simplex virus in detail, all drugs were added at different stages during viral infection. For comparison, all untreated controls contained the same concentration of ethanol as the drug-treated viruses, in order to exclude any infl uence of ethanol. When the host cells were pretreated with drugs prior to infection, some of the tested drugs showed minor effects on viral infection, e.g. eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil and \u03b1-pinene (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, pretreatment of HSV-1 with the oils or monoterpenic compounds for 1 h prior to infection caused a signifi cant reduction in plaque formation. At maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations of the tested drugs, infectivity was reduced by >96% for all essential oils as well as for three of the monoterpenes, \u03b1terpinene, \u03b3-terpinene and \u03b1-pinene (Fig. 3) . With the exception of 1,8-cineole, all other constituents revealed a plaque reduction of herpes simplex virus between about 80% and 90%. Acyclovir showed the highest antiviral activity when added during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 98.6%. This drug inhibits specifi cally the viral DNA polymerase during the replication cycle when new viral DNA is synthesized. However, only minor effects on viral infection were detected when cells or viruses were pretreated with acyclovir (data not shown). In contrast, when the oils or compounds were added to the overlay medium after penetration of the viruses into the host cells, plaque formation was not signifi cantly reduced, only \u03b1-pinene and 1,8-cineole being moderately effective (Fig. 4) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 89, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 524, "end": 532, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1547, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1894, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1998, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2255, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 3026, "end": 3034, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3401, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 4168, "end": 4176, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly targeting medicinal plants with the aim of identifying lead compounds, focusing particularly on suitable alternative antiviral agents.

All tested essential oils and most monoterpenes exhibited high levels of antiviral activity against HSV-1 in viral suspension tests. At maximum noncytotoxic concentrations plaque formation was signifi cantly reduced by >96% by eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil and thyme oil, most monoterpenic constituents were able to suppress viral infection by >80%. High antiviral activity was observed for essential oils and isolated monoterpenes when herpesvirus was incubated with these drugs prior to host cell infection. These results suggest that the investigated drugs directly inactivate herpes virus and might interfere with virion envelope structures or mask viral structures which are necessary for adsorption or entry into host cells. A virucidal activity of Melaleuca armillaris essential oil has been reported recently (Farag et al., 2004) and dissolution of the HSV envelope by treatment with oregano essential oil has been described (Siddiqui et al., 1996) . Thus different mechanisms of antiviral activity of different essential oils seem to be present. The inhibition of HSV by the tested essential oils and monoterpenes appears to occur before adsorption but not after penetration of the virus into the cell. It remains to be determined whether the inhibitory effect of essential oils is due to binding of the essential oil to viral proteins involved in host cell adsorption and penetration. De Logu et al., (2000) reported an inactivation of herpesviruses and prevention of cell to cell spread by Santolina insularis essential oil. However, no antiviral effect was observed during the intracellular replication phase, which is in accordance with our results for essential oils and monoterpenes. Adenovirus, a virus without envelope, was not affected by eucalyptus essential oil due to the lack of a viral envelope (Cermelli et al., 2008) . Sesquiterpenes, e.g. triptofordin C-2 and sesquiterpene coumarins inhibit cytomegalovirus, (Hayashi et al., 1996) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Wen et al., 2007) and rhinovirus (Rollinger et al., 2008) . Pusztai et al. (2008) reported a specifi c inhibition of the CMV immediate early gene expression, whereas other sesquiterpenes are moderately virucidal against different enveloped viruses, e.g. herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, measles virus and infl uenza virus (Hayashi et al., 1996) . Isoborneol, a monoterpene and a component of several plant essential oils, showed virucidal activity against HSV-1 and specifi cally inhibited glycosylation of viral proteins (Armaka et al., 1999) . The application of cineole protects mice against infection with HSV-2 (Bourne et al., 1999) . Since essential oils are able to inhibit acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 isolates (Schnitzler et al., 2007) , the mechanism of interaction between these compounds and acyclovir with HSV must be different. Acyclovir inhibits virus replication by interference with the DNA polymerase inside the cell, whereas essential oils and monoterpenes probably inactivate HSV before it enters the cell. Viral resistance to acyclovir represents a particular problem, the prevalence of resistance in acyclovir-treated immunocompromised individuals is approximately 4% to 7% (Christoph et al., 1998; Stranska et al., 2005) . Therefore other antiherpetic agents which are effective for viral mutants resistant to current antiviral agents are of great interest for topical treatment.

These fi ndings are in contrast to results of antiviral activity, where the complex mixture of the essential oil revealed a higher antiviral activity and selectivity index of 60, whereas single major monoterpenes \u03b1-terpinene, \u03b3-terpinene and terpinen-4-ol revealed low selectivity indices of 6.5, 5.4 and 10.8, respectively. These rather low selectivity indices of monoterpenes will not permit topical application on mucous membranes. The tested monoterpenes dominate the toxicity of essential oils, e.g. eucalyptus oil consists of about 80% 1,8-cineole, both revealed very low toxicity but also low selectivity indices. For thyme oil, the TC 50 of 70 \u03bcg/mL corresponds well to its major compounds p-cymene and thymol, with TC 50 values in the same range of 65 \u03bcg/mL and 85 \u03bcg/mL. The same is true for tea tree oil, the main constituents \u03b1-terpinene, \u03b3-terpinene and terpinen-4-ol contribute equally to a fi nal TC 50 of 120 \u03bcg/mL for the mixture in this essential oil. Taken together, the composition of monoterpenes in these essential oils dominates their toxic activity. However, the antiviral activity of single monoterpenes does not contribute equally to the antiviral activity of the essential oil. Tea tree oil is composed of about 10% \u03b1-terpinene, 20% \u03b3-terpinene and 40% terpinen-4-ol. Although terpinen-4-ol is the major compound in tea tree oil and revealed a much lower antiviral activity than \u03b1-terpinene and \u03b3-terpinene, the complex oil demonstrated a high antiviral activity. Cos et al. (2006 Cos et al. ( , 2008 recommended IC 50 values for promising natural products against infectious diseases, e.g. for extracts below 100 \u03bcg/mL and below 25 \u03bcm for pure compounds. The essential oils in our study revealed IC 50 values of 55 \u03bcg/mL, 2 \u03bcg/mL and 11 \u03bcg/mL for eucalyptus, tea tree and thyme, respectively, and are far below the recommended cut off. However, only the monoterpene citral revealed an IC 50 value below the suggested cut off with 23 \u03bcm, all other monoterpenes displayed higher IC 50 values and do not present promising antiinfective agents according to this suggestion. However the most important predictive value for future application of these drugs is their selectivity index, Amoros et al. (1992) recommended a selectivity index of at least 4 as appropriate. According to this suggestion, all essential oils and monoterpenes, with the exception of thymol and 1,8-cineole might be suitable agents. However, drugs with a higher selectivity are preferable (Vanden Berghe et al., 1986) , e.g. tea tree oil which had already been successfully applied in labial herpes infections. Other compounds of essential oils need to be screened but a mixture of different compounds in essential oils seems to be superior and preferable to single compounds. Considering the lipophilic nature of tea tree oil which enables penetration of the skin, it is a promising topical therapeutic agent in the treatment of recurrent herpes infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 189, "text": "(Cox et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1699, "text": "Cos et al.
