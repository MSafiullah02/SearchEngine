            "text": "Coronaviruses possess the largest genome among any RNA viruses. The genome contains several essential genes that encode the viral proteins necessary for replication, transcription and infectious virus assembly. The essential genes comprise the open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1ab) that are translated to produce polyproteins that are involved in viral RNA replication and transcription. In addition to these genes, the other essential genes encode the common viral structural proteins, S, E, M and N, which are involved in infectious virus assembly (Fig. 1\n). Interspersed between these genes in the coronavirus genome are several other genes called \u201cgroup-specific or accessory genes\u201d and their gene products are called \u201caccessory proteins\u201d because many studies using reverse genetics and targeted mutagenesis analysis have shown that these genes and their products are dispensable for virus growth in vitro (Curtis et al., 2002, de Haan et al., 2002, Haijema et al., 2004, Sims et al., 2005, Wesley et al., 1991, Yount et al., 2005). Nevertheless, many of these genes are still maintained in the virus genome suggesting that they might play a very important role in the survival of the virus under the natural environment of the infected host.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV genome has an unusually high number of accessory genes in the 3\u2032-end of the genome (Fig. 1). The genome contains eight accessory genes, two between S and E genes (ORFs 3a and 3b), five are located between the M and N genes (6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b) and one within the N gene (9b) (Fig. 1) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The sequences of most of these genes are conserved among different human and animal isolates of SARS-CoV. However, as expected, these group-specific genes have no similarity with accessory genes of coronaviruses belonging to other groups (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). In addition, there is no significant amino-acid sequence similarity between the accessory proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV accessory genes and any known viral or cellular proteins. The field of coronavirus accessory proteins has gained considerable attention with the advent of SARS epidemic. Several studies, primarily using expression systems in cell culture, have resulted in the discovery of novel functions for the SARS-CoV accessory proteins (Table 1\n). The establishment of reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV has greatly facilitated the studies to determine the biological functions of these proteins in infected cells and/or animals (Almazan et al., 2006, Yount et al., 2003).",

As a 274 amino-acid long protein, it is the largest of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins. Hydrophobicity analysis and topology studies have shown that 3a protein is an O-glycosylated protein with three transmembrane domains and has an N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal endodomain (Ito et al., 2005, Oostra et al., 2006, Song et al., 2005, Tan et al., 2004c, Yuan et al., 2005a). Expression studies have shown that the C-terminus of 3a protein has two intracellular protein sorting and trafficking signals, the Yxx\u03a6 and di-acidic motifs, which are important for the transport of 3a protein to the cell surface, where it subsequently undergoes endocytosis (Tan et al., 2004c). Lu et al. showed that 3a protein forms a homotetramer complex through intermolecular disulfide bridges and functions as a potassium-permeable channel-like structure (Lu et al., 2006). The biological role of the ion channel activity of 3a protein in the virus life cycle remains to be established.",

In infected cells, 3a protein is localized in both intracellular and plasma membranes (Ito et al., 2005, Oostra et al., 2006, Song et al., 2005, Tan et al., 2004c, Yuan et al., 2005a). Analysis of 3a protein in infected cells and SARS patients suggested that 3a protein might be incorporated into virus particles as a result of its association with S protein (Zeng et al., 2004). Biochemical studies examining the interaction of 3a protein with other viral proteins revealed that 3a protein interacts with the structural proteins, S and M, in the Golgi apparatus proximal to the site of virus assembly and budding (Tan et al., 2004c, Yuan et al., 2005a). 3a protein also interacts with the structural protein, E, and another viral accessory protein, 7a (Tan et al., 2004c). A recent study showed that 3a protein binds to the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of SARS genomic RNA in vitro (Sharma et al., 2007). As expected from its multiple interactions with other viral structural proteins, studies have shown clearly that 3a is a novel viral structural protein (Ito et al., 2005, Shen et al., 2005). Several studies have also demonstrated the incorporation of 3a protein into virus-like particles (VLPs), which are produced by co-expression of the virus structural proteins, S, E, M and N (Huang et al., 2006b, Shen et al., 2005). However, 3a protein is not necessary for VLP formation and SARS-CoV assembly. The production of VLPs in the absence of 3a protein expression clearly demonstrates that 3a protein is not necessary for VLP production; (Hsieh et al., 2005, Huang et al., 2006a, Huang et al., 2004, Mortola and Roy, 2004). Furthermore, the generation of a viable SARS-CoV deletion mutant lacking the 3a gene that replicates efficiently in cell culture also highlights the non-essential function of 3a protein for SARS-CoV assembly in cell culture (Yount et al., 2005).",

The sorting domains, Yxx\u03a6 and di-acidic motifs, are not required for its efficient release (Huang et al., 2006b). Although the biological role of the released 3a protein in SARS-CoV life cycle remains unclear, some clues into its potential function could be obtained from observations about the highly antigenic nature of 3a protein in SARS patients. In convalescent SARS patients, antibodies against 3a protein are readily detected (Tan et al., 2004b). A strong and potentially protective humoral response is directed against the amino terminus of 3a protein in SARS patients (Zhong et al., 2006). Furthermore, immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acids 15\u201328 from the amino terminal ectodomain of 3a protein results in the induction of neutralizing antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV infection in VeroE6 cells (Akerstrom et al., 2006). It is worth speculating the contribution of the released 3a protein as an immune decoy in countering the host humoral response to 3a protein in SARS patients, although any such biological role of 3a protein needs experimental evidence.",

The consensus opinion, from several published studies, is that virus-induced immune pathology and the disease outcome is most probably determined by a dysregulated immune response with an intense up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Law et al., 2005a, Reghunathan et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2004). The role of accessory proteins in the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in SARS-CoV infected cells has received some attention in some recent studies. 3a protein up-regulates the expression and secretion of fibrinogen in human lung epithelial cell line, A549 (Tan et al., 2005). This study also showed the up-regulation of fibrinogen in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and the authors conclude that excessive production of fibrinogen might contribute to SARS pathogenesis by enhancing cytokine production (Tan et al., 2005). A recent report showed that the expression of SARS-CoV 3a protein in A549 cells activates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), a critical transcription factor involved in the activation of pro-inflammatory genes, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Kanzawa et al., 2006). This study also showed that 3a protein expression enhances the activation of the NF-\u03baB-responsive chemokines, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and RANTES (CCL5), which are known to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV infection (Kanzawa et al., 2006, Law et al., 2005a).",

            "text": "We have similar data for the role of 3a protein in the induction of NF-\u03baB-promoter activity in vitro. 3a protein expression in HEK 293 cells significantly augmented the activation of NF-\u03baB and RANTES-promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression in the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), an intracellular intermediate of viral RNA replication (Fig. 2A and B). The enhancement of NF-\u03baB promoter activation in the presence of 3a protein involves an intracellular sensor of dsRNA because transfection of dsRNA into cells is required for the activity of 3a protein (Fig. 3\n). Similarly, SARS-CoV infection in 293/ACE2 cells, stably expressing the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), induces the activation of NF-\u03baB and RANTES promoters, albeit with delayed kinetics compared to the control virus, Sendai virus, which induces a robust activation of NF-\u03baB promoter at earlier times post-infection (Fig. 4\n). In contrast to our finding that showed a significant induction of NF-\u03baB-dependent promoters in SARS-CoV-infected 293/ACE2 cells compared to mock-infected cells, other studies have reported that SARS-CoV infection does not significantly induce NF-\u03baB-promoter-driven gene expression in 293 cells (Frieman et al., 2007a, Spiegel et al., 2005). In addition, SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells also up-regulates the expression of NFKBIA, an inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB complex (Leong et al., 2005). The discrepancy between these studies and our observation could be attributed to differences in the cell type (highly permissive 293/ACE2 cells; \u223c 80 to 90% infected) and the timing of the assay as we observed a delayed kinetics of NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter activation compared to other studies that examined the induction at earlier times post-infection (Frieman et al., 2007a, Spiegel et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2005).",

A recent report has assigned a very important function for 3b protein in modulating the host innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). This study showed that 3b protein expression inhibits both interferon production and signaling, which are key components of the antiviral innate immune response (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007).

In contrast, expression of each of the other SARS-CoV accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, 7a, 7b, and 8 using recombinant MHV did not affect virus replication and virulence, suggesting that ORF 6 protein might play a role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Subsequent studies using recombinant MHV also demonstrated that ORF 6 protein associated with viral RNA, co-localized with replicating viral RNA on cytoplasmic vesicles and enhanced MHV viral RNA and protein synthesis (Tangudu et al., 2007). Furthermore, studies showing the interaction of ORF 6 protein with SARS-CoV non-structural protein (nsp) 8, one of the replicase proteins encoded in ORF 1a, using a yeast two-hybrid screen and in SARS-CoV-infected cells supports the notion that ORF 6 protein could play a role in virus replication (Kumar et al., 2007). While nsp12 protein is the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for SARS-CoV, nsp8 is a second, newly identified sequence-specific RdRp (Imbert et al., 2006). It is proposed that nsp8 protein is a low-fidelity primase producing short RNA primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 for initiation of viral RNA replication. Although the biological significance of the reported interaction between ORF 6 protein and nsp8 protein is still unclear, it is reasonable to speculate that ORF 6 protein probably regulates SARS-CoV RNA replication.",

ORF 6 protein expression blocks the nuclear translocation of STAT1 after IFN treatment indirectly by disrupting the nuclear import complex formation through interaction of ORF 6 protein, via its C-terminus, with karyopherin alpha 2 (Frieman et al., 2007b). Karyopherin alpha 2 is a member of a complex of nuclear localization signal receptors that includes karyopherin alpha 1 and karyopherin beta 1 (Frieman et al., 2007b). The authors conclude that ORF 6 protein-mediated inhibition of the expression of STAT1-transcribed, IFN response genes, which is critical for the host to establish the antiviral state, could contribute to the immune evasion by SARS-CoV (Frieman et al., 2007b).",

The crystal structure of the lumenal domain of 7a protein shows a compact seven-stranded beta sandwich, which is similar in folding and topology to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Nelson et al., 2005). 7a protein was shown to be present in the perinuclear region in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fielding et al., 2006, Fielding et al., 2004, Nelson et al., 2005).

During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, most human isolates of SARS-CoV had a naturally occurring 29-nt deletion in ORF 8, resulting in two discrete ORFs 8a and 8b (Guan et al., 2003). These observations suggested that the deletion of 29-nt could have some correlation with the adaptation of SARS-CoV to humans during the outbreak. However, insertion of this 29-nt sequence into human isolates using reverse genetics, which merges ORF 8a and 8b into a continuous ORF 8, had little impact on virus growth and RNA replication in cell culture (Yount et al., 2005). This data suggested the 29-nt deletion might not be responsible for the increased pathogenicity during the adaptation of SARS-CoV to humans.",

            "text": "The accumulation of novel information about the diverse biological functions of SARS-CoV accessory proteins has raised some interesting ideas and questions about their role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. As most of the studies are performed using protein expressions in cell culture systems, it is imperative to validate these biological functions in the context of virus replication and pathogenesis in relevant animal models. As a first step in this direction, Yount et al. examined the role of SARS-CoV accessory proteins in virus replication in mice (Yount et al., 2005). Yount et al. showed that infection of six-week-old female BALB/c mice with the Urbani strain-derived infectious clone of SARS-CoV or its accessory gene deletion mutants resulted in no difference in virus titers in the lung at 2 days post-infection (Yount et al., 2005). However, it must be noted that this is not an ideal animal model for SARS disease because intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV into mice results in SARS-CoV replication in the lung with no clinical signs and symptoms of SARS (Subbarao et al., 2004, Subbarao and Roberts, 2006). A recent study showed that infection of BALB/c mice with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) resulted in a lethal infection that reproduces the clinical signs and pulmonary pathology observed in severe human cases of SARS (Roberts et al., 2007). Furthermore, two groups have independently developed an animal model for lethal infection of SARS-CoV using transgenic mice that express the functional SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2 (McCray et al., 2007, Tseng et al., 2007). Progress in this area was bolstered by the publication of a report by Rockx et al. that showed the development of two novel lethal SARS-CoV infection models in aged mice using recombinant SARS-CoV that express the spike (S) glycoprotein variants from an early human isolate and palm civet isolate (Rockx et al., 2007). Mice infected with these lethal S glycoprotein variants of SARS-CoV developed ARDS and the pathological symptoms were very similar to the pathology observed in acute human cases of SARS (Rockx et al., 2007). These exciting advances in the field combined with the availability of the reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV (Almazan et al., 2006, Yount et al., 2003) provide us the tools to investigate the role of accessory proteins in the SARS-CoV life cycle and address some key questions:1.What is the importance of virion-associated SARS-CoV accessory proteins, 3a, ORF 6, 7a and 7b, in the virus life cycle?2.What is the role of the individual accessory proteins in determining the outcome of lethal SARS-CoV infection in animal models? Are the SARS-CoV accessory gene deletion mutants less virulent and if so, which accessory gene(s) is responsible for attenuation?3.Are the deletion mutants of ORF 3b and ORF 6 more sensitive to IFN-induced inhibition of SARS-CoV infection in vitro? What is the mechanism of IFN signaling inhibition by 3b protein?4.Does the IFN antagonizing activity of 3b and ORF 6 proteins play a significant role in modulating SARS-CoV replication and/or pathogenesis in animal models? Has SARS-CoV evolved with multiple IFN antagonizing proteins for its survival and propagation in different susceptible hosts?5.What is the contribution of accessory genes in the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in infected cells and animals? Are the deletion mutants of SARS-CoV ORFs 3a and 7a significantly impaired in inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in infected cells and/or animals and if so, how does it alter the disease progression in infected animals?\n",
