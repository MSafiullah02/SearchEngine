            "text": "Whole\u2010transcriptome amplification (WTA) is an emerging technology designed to representatively amplify entire transcriptomes from limited quantities of starting RNA. WTA increases the total amount of RNA so that greater quantities of nucleic acids are available for downstream applications. This may be particularly useful for technologies limited by insufficient quantities of quality target RNA, such as microarray\u2010based gene expression studies and RT\u2010PCR. Several WTA methods (both PCR\u2010based amplification and non\u2010PCR\u2010based linear amplification methods) have been described (Lauss et al. 2007) including in vitro transcription (IVT)\u2010based amplification (Van Gelder et al. 1990), multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and universally primed PCR. Recently, a novel approach to WTA was developed which avoids primer and template biases associated with PCR and alleviates the need for a poly\u2010A tail (which is absent in bacterial mRNA). The TransPlex\u2122 WTA kit (Sigma\u2010Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) relies on an initial round of MDA, followed by PCR\u2010based amplification using universal primers to create WTA product. In TransPlex\u2122 WTA, RNA is first incubated with reverse transcriptase and nonself\u2010complementary primers with a quasi\u2010random 3\u2032 end and a universal 5\u2032 end. As the annealed primers extend, they displace single strands that serve as new template. The resulting collection of random, overlapping fragments, each containing a universal end sequence, is then amplified using universal primers to produce WTA product. TransPlex\u2122 WTA may be superior to IVT because it does not require the presence of a poly\u2010A tail, which would necessitate oligo(dT) priming to generate cDNA, leading to 3\u2032 bias (Tomlins et al. 2006). It may also be more successful in amplifying small quantities of RNA because of the combination of techniques.",

            "text": "To date, application of WTA to detection or characterization of microbial RNA has been limited because of the relative novelty of WTA technologies and difficulty of adapting existing methods to microbial RNA. IVT was successfully adapted to artificial and environmental mixed bacterial community samples by attaching random hexamers to the T7 RNA promoter sequence in lieu of oligo(dT) (Gao et al. 2007). However, microarray analysis of WTA product from these mixed bacterial communities showed representative detection was dependent upon the amount of starting RNA. In another study, Rift Valley fever virus from brain biopsies was successfully amplified by WTA in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus DNA (Berthet et al. 2008), but starting amounts of RNA were high, ranging from 104 to 106 copies. More recently, TransPlex\u2122 WTA has been used on cultures of coronavirus to generate sufficient nucleic acid for sequencing new human viruses when propagation in cell culture is inefficient (Banach et al. 2009).",

            "text": "A potential new application of WTA is to improve detection of RNA viruses in environmental media where they may pose a risk to human health. RNA viruses may occur in very small concentrations in drinking water and other environmental media, making them difficult to detect with molecular methods. Additionally, there are numerous types of RNA viruses (e.g. enteroviruses, noroviruses, astroviruses) that may be present in environmental media, further complicating detection because they do not share a common gene, analogous to the conserved 16S gene in bacteria, which may be targeted for detection by a singleplex or easily multiplexed PCR. To determine whether WTA can improve molecular detection by amplifying viral RNA from environmental media, this study assessed the ability of WTA to maintain log\u2010linear amplification over a range of initial RNA concentrations, to efficiently amplify RNA from environmental matrices and to overcome inhibition by substances in these matrices.",

Although echovirus is not often associated with known outbreaks, it is a putative agent of waterborne disease (Leclerc et al. 2002). One concern with the application of WTA to low numbers of pathogens is the requirement for a specific amount of starting RNA, as quantities suggested for WTA are higher than the amount of target RNA which would be anticipated in a typical environmental sample. This study is one of the first to assess the ability of WTA to improve the detection of environmentally relevant quantities of human pathogens in environmental media and to test TransPlex\u2122 WTA on environmental pathogens.",

In this study, increases in EV target copy number of c. 2\u20134 logs after application of WTA resulted in significant improvements in detection by qRT\u2010PCR, as evidenced by the statistically significant increase in the total number of positively detected low copy number (at or near the LOD) samples. However, it is difficult to accurately quantify improvements in sensitivity from application of WTA (other than positive/negative detection), because consistently obtaining an aliquot positive for virus when the sample concentration is below a certain limit is improbable (Chen et al. 2007). In this study, when target concentrations are at or below the estimated LOD, the probability of successful WTA is decreased because of decreased probability of target being added to the WTA reaction. Additionally, as formation of WTA template is a random process, metatranscriptomes produced from replicate amplifications can differ, particularly for low copy number samples. Although WTA of low copy number samples may result in infrequent amplification because of these factors, when a target is successfully amplified, improvements in concentration are significant, as demonstrated by pre\u2010WTA:WTA ratios that are higher for averages than medians (Table 1).",

Although SYBR Green qRT\u2010PCR detection of pre\u2010WTA samples with the Schwab et al. (1995) EV primer set was effective, it was not effective for analysis of WTA product. Detection of multiple product peaks in melting curve analyses of SYBR Green\u2013based qRT\u2010PCR indicates that multiple products were formed during WTA, a by\u2010product of template shearing during the nonspecific, nonprimer\u2010directed amplification. The multiple nontarget products ultimately interfered with detection of the target EV amplicon. Also, TransPlex\u2122 WTA creates both single\u2010stranded and double\u2010stranded cDNA product. Because SYBR Green is an intercalating dye, which indiscriminately binds between all dsDNA molecules, the high background fluorescence can probably be attributed to the large quantities of nontarget dsDNA produced during WTA. TaqMan probes increase the specificity of qRT\u2010PCR by binding only with the target amplicon. However, product information from Sigma\u2010Aldrich now states that cDNA from WTA should be purified prior to use because some components may interfere with downstream applications.
