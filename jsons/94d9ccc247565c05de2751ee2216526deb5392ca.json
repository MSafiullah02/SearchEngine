Some of the more commonly encountered drug interactions to be considered in patients taking antibiotics for the treatment of LRTIs aetiology, and the differentiation of pneumonia caused by 'typical' and 'atypical' pathogens on clinical grounds alone has been shown to be unreliable. A chest X-ray is not considered necessary for most patients managed in the community, but should be considered if it would help in the differential diagnosis and management of the acute illness, if progress is not satisfactor y at review, and/or if underlying pathology such as lung cancer is considered. 4 Point-of-care tests are available for influenza (A and B). Specificity is generally excellent but sensitivity may be as low as 50-74 per cent. These rapid tests allow a diagnosis of influenza to be made within 10-30 min-utes, such that timely prescription of antivirals can be made and/or the clinician may feel more confident about not prescribing antibiotics. 5 Causative agents Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major cause of CAP, accounting for over a third of cases in the community. Mycoplasma pneumoniae exhibits periodicity, with epidemics every four to five years, has a low morbidity and mainly affects younger individuals. Influenza virus, along with a number of other viruses, contributes a sizeable proportion of cases (currently around 13 per cent, but potentially much higher in an influenza pandemic). Other causes of CAP More unusual forms of pneumonia to consider are Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously known as Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia in patients with HIV and other forms of immunosuppression (seen much less frequently these days because of the use of prophylactic co-trimoxazole), TB in those with a more chronic pneumonia, and rare fungal and bacterial forms of pneumonia in those who have travelled.",

            "text": "Pneumonia in children has a slightly different epidemiological pattern. Neonates may develop pneumonia from organisms acquired from the mother's genital tract such as Group B Streptococcus, Gram-negative organisms and Chlamydia trachomatis. These children will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment. In one-month to four-year-old children most cases of CAP are viral in origin, eg respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus and the newly recognised metapneumovirus. 8 These are generally self-limiting and do not require antibiotics. Bacterial pneumonias in this age group are predominantly due to Strep. pneumoniae, whereas in the over-fours Strep. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are the most frequently isolated organisms. 9 Resistance Concerns exist over the growing number of resistant bacteria, in particular Strep. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Penicillin-resistant Strep. pneumoniae is of concern, especially as resistance is frequently linked to macrolide resistance. Penicillin resistance in Strep. pneumoniae varies widely between countries, communities and groups of patients within those communities. Currently approximately 6-8 per cent of clinical isolates of Strep. pneumoniae are resistant to penicillin, and 12-15 per cent resistant to macrolides. Resistance of Strep. pneumoniae to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones is low. Resistance of H. influenzae to ampicillin -mainly due to beta-lactamase production -varies geographically, but is around 15 per cent in the UK. Treatment Empirical treatment in the community is based on the fact that Strep. pneumoniae remains the leading cause of CAP. Prudent use of antibiotics is important in order to treat infections appropriately, to curb the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, and to minimise side-effects and maximise compliance. Once a decision is made to treat, local resistance patterns must be taken into account. BTS recommendations are based on current practice and experience and take into account the cost, tolerability, safety and side-effect profile of the drugs currently available. As yet, the incidence of highly penicillin-resistant strains of Strep. pneumoniae in most areas of the UK is sufficiently low to allow amoxicillin (in adequate doses) to remain the first-line therapy for adults and for children over five years of age -provided that the patient has not just returned from an area where the incidence is much greater. Note, however, that the latest BTS guidelines recommend adequate dosing with amoxicillin (500mg-1g three times daily) to cover intermediate-resistant strains. 4, 10 Macrolides such as erythromycin are the secondline agents of choice if there are contraindications to amoxicillin or the patient fails to tolerate it. They are also the first-line agents in children over five years in whom M. pneumoniae is common. 11 Many people favour clarithromycin over erythro mycin because of its better GI tolerance. Azithro mycin is another alternative to erythromycin.",
