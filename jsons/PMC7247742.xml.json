As in similar periods in the past, there is bound to be considerable instability and uncertainty before the new society and economy take shape. In the meantime, we can identify actions that will shape change for the better, and help to build resilience to the inevitable shocks inherent in, and generated by, the complex system of systems constituted by the economy, society, and the environment. These challenges require updating the way governments devise and implement policies. This in turn will require more realistic tools and techniques to design these policies than those that failed to anticipate previous crises or to help design sustainable solutions to them.",

The systems approach can promote cross-sectoral, multidisciplinary collaboration in the process of policy formulation by taking proper account of the crucial linkages between issues generally treated separately within different specializations and scientific and institutional \u201csilos.\u201d In order to promote positive social and economic change, a range of policies has to be integrated, including educational, demographic, employment, well-being, and technology and innovation policies.

Serious disease outbreaks such as Covid-19 are the result of systemic properties, and in this case, emergence in particular. Emergence describes a process whereby a situation arises through the interaction of a number of actors and influences, without any intention to create that situation. A recent paper published by the UK Royal Society (Johnson et al. 2020) shows that emerging infectious diseases in humans are frequently caused by pathogens originating from animal hosts, and that virus transmission risk is highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions because of exploitation and loss of habitat share more viruses with humans. In other words, impacts on ecosystems due to changes to socioeconomic systems, such as the introduction of intensive agriculture, play a role in creating or aggravating epidemic risk. One study looking at the emergence of infectious diseases calculated that since 1940, intensive agriculture has been associated with more than 25% of all infectious diseases that emerged in humans and more than half of all infectious diseases that spilled over from animals to humans (Rohr et al. 2019).",

More specifically, the concentration of industrial capacities and economic activity into smaller and more efficient sectors, up to the international level, has produced highly lucrative yet fragile supply chains, and economic exchanges whose disruptions could have sweeping effects in unexpected areas. While this has provided considerable opportunities, it has also made the systems we rely on in our daily lives (e.g., international supply chains) vulnerable to sudden and unexpected disruption, as the result of either an external shock, the way the system has self-organised, or a combination of both (Juttner and Maklan 2011; OECD and FAO 2019). The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, for example, exposed the limits of just-in-time supply chain organization, and highlighted the importance of flexibility, diversification, and adaptability (Fujimoto 2011; Golan et al. 2020).",

A key question, therefore, is focused not upon whether systemic risk would cause substantial cascading losses to the international economy, but rather on what type of disruption would trigger such a chain of events in the first place. The Covid-19 outbreak has led to a crisis with considerable cascading losses for health but also for much of the global economy, with concordant high social costs. At the moment, national governments are struggling to absorb the shock generated by the pandemic, but in time the international community will overcome the crisis and begin the recovery phase.",

The disastrous consequences of recent bush fires in Australia and extensive flooding in many parts of the world, both attributable to climate change, show that resilience must become a core philosophy within system management and operations to ensure we are able to continue to function in the midst of these disruptions, and particularly those aggravated by disruptions from Covid-19.",

In the short term, that means identifying the people and activities most affected, assessing how measures to help them will impact others, and underlining that difficult trade-offs between health, economic, social, and other goals are inevitable. In the longer term, an approach that reacts to the systemic origins and impacts of major shocks is needed if policies are to be effective. The Covid-19 crisis also shows how important it is to keep resources in reserve for times when unexpected upheavals in the system prevent it from functioning normally (and the argument can be made for not depleting natural resources). Furthermore, given the interdependence of our economies and social systems, the pandemic also highlights the need for strengthened international cooperation (building on existing frameworks for emergency preparedness) based on evidence to tackle systemic threats and help avert systemic collapse.1 Helbing (2012) and others have noted that the consequences of failing to appreciate and manage the characteristics of complex global systems and problems can be immense.",

The elderly disproportionality experience more negative health outcomes, but the effects on them result from more than just the medical conditions common to other at-risk groups, such as obesity, smoking, heart disease, and diabetes. A number of additional factors contribute to the total impact. The elderly are exceptionally exposed to death from the disease, but also risks arising from isolation and weak social ties, compounded by the fragmentation of health and social care services. School closures are the main impact on children and young people, but the capacity to compensate for the projected loss in learning varies according to socioeconomic status, with those from low-income and/or single-parent families likely to be the most affected by the closure of schools and childcare facilities. The PISA 2015 surveys (OECD 2016) reveal that nearly a quarter of 15-year-olds of low socioeconomic status do not have an office or a quiet place to study; just over 1 in 5 teenagers in the same families have no access to a computer for school work or an internet connection.

The OECD Interim Economic Outlook, released on March 2, 2020, shows how restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services, in combination with containment measures such as business closures, have cut manufacturing and domestic demand sharply in China, while also affecting the rest of the world through business travel and tourism, global supply chains, commodities, and loss of confidence. The initial direct impact of the shutdowns could be a decline in the level of output of between one-fifth to one-quarter in many economies, with consumer expenditure potentially dropping by around one-third. This is far greater than anything experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. And this estimate only covers the initial direct impact in the sectors involved and does not take into account any additional indirect impacts that may arise. Nonetheless, it is clear that the impact of the shutdowns imposed on many economies will weaken short-term growth prospects substantially, equivalent to a decline in annual GDP growth of up to 2 percentage points for each month that strict containment measures are imposed. If the shutdown continued uninterrupted for 3 months, with no offsetting factors, annual GDP growth could be between 4 and 6 percentage points lower than it otherwise might have been. However, the worst potential impacts may be offset by measures such as the USD$5 trillion in fiscal spending the G20 countries agreed to inject into the global economy at their summit on March 26, 2020.",

The poor will be hardest hit in countries such as Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, with up to 50% or higher of the population employed in the informal sector and few channels through which any aid could reach such people. Oxfam estimates that the economic crisis caused by Covid-19 could push half a billion people into poverty (Oxfam 2020). However, conditional cash transfers were scaled up very effectively following the 2008 global financial crisis; even in the Least Developed Countries, food for work programs and other forms of social protection can provide some relief. As to the supply side of the economy, firms that have had to reduce their activities will take time to restart production and to contribute to global supply chains.",

The global average debt-to-GDP ratio (weighted by each country\u2019s GDP) edged up to 226% in 2018, 1\u00bd percentage points above the previous year (IMF 2020). Despite efforts to reduce fiscal deficits, many governments still have high levels of debt following their interventions to deal with the financial crisis and its aftermath, and sovereign spreads for some countries are starting to widen. Private debt, encouraged by low interest rates, is even more worrying. In advanced economies, IMF data show that the corporate debt ratio has gradually increased since 2010 and it is now at the same level as in 2008, the previous peak. In several major economies debt is, or was, increasingly used for financial risk-taking (to fund distribution of dividends, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions). Much of the debt is high speculative-grade debt, and a significant fraction of corporate debt is now rated BBB, the lowest investment grade rating. Almost half of all US corporate bonds maturing in the next 5 years are below investment grade. Global household debt is over USD$47 trillion, compared to USD$35 trillion going into the 2008 crisis.",

This extends the boundaries of what is modeled and allows for broader ranges of interactions to assess policy interventions. Going beyond the integration of existing tools may involve pioneering applications and innovative methodologies and tools in several areas, including explicit accounting for uncertainty, multiple agents with strategic interactions, bounded rationality, including consumption preferences and consumer choices, and network effects linked to complex interconnectedness and systemic risks.",

This principle is evident in global supply chains, surely one of the most efficient components of the international economy.

One lesson from Covid-19 is that crises do not repeat themselves. The fact that we were able to contain previous coronavirus crises such as SARS led to a sense of complacency in some instances about our ability to contain any future crisis. We cannot afford to be complacent about the other grave crisis we are facing: the climate emergency. In systemic terms, this is not a shock, with all that implies of a sudden, unexpected occurrence, but more like a stress. Systems analysis teaches us that stresses such as global warming are non-linear. The system may continue to function more or less normally for a long period and only degrade slowly, but it can then reach a tipping point from which it cannot recover, and collapse can then be extremely rapid. Covid-19 shows that we have to act now, because we simply don\u2019t know how changes in one system may evolve and impact other systems, or in this case how a mutation in a virus could cripple the world economy. We can anticipate, however, that serious damage to a natural system, such as biodiversity loss, or significant changes, such as sea level rise or increased occurrence of extreme weather, will have serious impacts on economic and social systems too. Further, as we recover and reconfigure systems for a brighter future, we must be cognizant of the fact that future systemic shocks may arise from any number of origins or industries, with no reasonable way to anticipate and prepare for the broad universe of threats. Instead, our systems must be designed for resilience, providing them with the capacity for recovery and adaptation regardless of the challenges they may face.",
