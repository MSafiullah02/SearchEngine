Once the virus infects the nasal mucosa, it is propelled to the nasopharynx through mucociliary action of the respiratory epithelium lining the nasal cavities. The virus then binds to epithelial cell receptors, which allow it to gain entrance into these cells. Within the epithelial cells rapid viral replication occurs.",

As a result, there is an influx of neutrophils, vasodilation, and an increase in vascular permeability that results in the leakage of plasma proteins into the nasal cavity. Additionally, parasympathetic stimulation occurs, which causes production of excess mucous.4 This process translates into nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing.4, 5\n",

Only randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included in their review. Their analysis indicated that nasal decongestants offer modest but significant relief of nasal congestion with a low incidence of adverse effects. Symptomatic relief was supported by a physiologic response of a significant reduction in nasal airway resistance. The evidence supports recommending a single dose trial of decongestants for patients with a URI. Those who experience improvement in symptoms of nasal congestion should be encouraged to continue treatment for 3 to 5 days. It is important to inform patients to discontinue use of topical decongestants after this period because of the risk of a rebound increase in congestion, as is seen with rhinitis medicamentosa. Patients with hypertension and/or benign prostatic hypertrophy should be closely monitored if using oral decongestants because the \u03b1-adrenergic properties may exacerbate these conditions.",

However, the pressed juice of the aerial parts of the species Echinacea purpurea may be effective in decreasing the severity and duration of cold symptoms if initiated early in the disease course.29 This is an area that warrants further study.",

Additionally, when considering all subjects, an affect on URI rates, symptom severity, or symptom duration was not appreciated.30\n",
