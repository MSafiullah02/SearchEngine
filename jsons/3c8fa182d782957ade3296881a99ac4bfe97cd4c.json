Actually, airborne transmission only has been considered as a possible route in historical disease outbreaks in livestock production when the outbreaks could not be attributed to other known routes such as direct contact transmission or fecal-oral transmission (Elbers et al., 2001; Gloster et al., 2003) .

Sources of dust in livestock production systems have been identified and assessed qualitatively and quantitatively (Aarnink et al., 1999; Donham and Gustafson, 1982) . It is generally accepted that all dust sources are also sources of airborne microorganisms because these source materials somehow contain certain microbial species that may be generated together with dust. However, the source identification of airborne microorganisms has not yet been extensively investigated, and it is thought to be more complicated than the source identification of dust in at least two ways. The first way is associated with the complexity of microbial species in a source. A source material always contains a microbial flora composed of many different microbial species. The second way is associated with the dynamic viability of microorganisms in the generation process (Milne et al., 1989) ; microorganisms may either decay or multiply in the source material. Thus, the source identification for microorganisms should also be dynamic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 550, "end": 569, "text": "(Bull et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 570, "end": 589, "text": "Cambra-Lopez, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 707, "end": 729, "text": "(Aarnink et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 730, "end": 757, "text": "Donham and Gustafson, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1473, "text": "(Milne et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Animals shed microorganisms mainly by means of fecal excretion, which may contain large amount of microorganisms (Letellier et al., 1999; Pell, 1997) . Consider two common zoonotic bacterial species, Salmonella and Escherichia, both have been found in feces: Salmonella at a concentration of 2-7 log CFU g \u22121 feces (Gray and Fedorka-Cray, 2001; Himathongkham et al., 1999) and E. coli at 2-6 log CFU g \u22121 feces (McGee et al., 2001; Omisakin et al., 2003) . Feces are also an important pathway for virus shedding from infected animals (Fouchier et al., 2003) . A list of viral species that may be excreted by cattle was proposed by Pell (1997) , including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. Many other viruses have been recovered from feces of other animal species, such as avian influenza A virus (Webster et al., 1978) and Newcastle disease virus (Spradbrow et al., 1988) in poultry, and swine fever virus (Van Oirschot, 1979) , hepatitis E virus (de Deus et al., 2007) , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Yoon et al., 1993) in pigs. The microorganisms in feces can become airborne when dried fecal particles are disturbed by air flow or animal activity. Some studies have managed to identify feces as the source of airborne microorganisms. A study by Duan et al. (2009) found the airborne E. coli strains inside and downwind from the pig houses were closely associated with those isolated from pig feces. Water content binds particles in feces and prevents their suspension, so, the microorganisms in dry feces that have low water content become airborne more easily than microorganisms in fresh feces. The water content of fresh feces (or manure, when urine is not separated) is the range of 60-90% (Derikx et al., 1994) , depending on the animal species. Under typical livestock housing environmental conditions, it may take hours or days to dry the feces to a water content less than 20%-the water content of airborne dust in livestock production systems (Aarnink et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2013) . This means the microorganisms must undergo a latent period between the moment they are excreted in the feces and the moment they become airborne.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 137, "text": "(Letellier et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 138, "end": 149, "text": "Pell, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 315, "end": 344, "text": "(Gray and Fedorka-Cray, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 345, "end": 372, "text": "Himathongkham et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 411, "end": 431, "text": "(McGee et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 432, "end": 454, "text": "Omisakin et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 534, "end": 557, "text": "(Fouchier et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 631, "end": 642, "text": "Pell (1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF209"}, {"start": 836, "end": 858, "text": "(Webster et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 887, "end": 911, "text": "(Spradbrow et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 946, "end": 966, "text": "(Van Oirschot, 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}, {"start": 987, "end": 1009, "text": "(de Deus et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1095, "text": "(Yoon et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF292"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1341, "text": "Duan et al.

This can result in mucus's microorganisms to become airborne and expelled from the body via breathing, coughing, and sneezing. This source of airborne microorganisms is widely accepted in the human model of disease transmission, and pathogenic microorganisms have been frequently recovered from the exhaled aerosols (Fabian et al., 2008; Weber and Stilianakis, 2008) . Only a few studies have been carried out to directly detect the microorganisms in exhaled air of animals. By sampling exhaled air in masks placed over the heads of infected pigs, Cho et al. (2006) recovered PRRSV and Hermann et al. (2008) recovered Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica. In contrast, Hermann et al. (2008) failed in recovering PRRSV, Porcine circovirus 2, swine influenza virus, and Porcine respiratory coronavirus in the exhaled air of infected pigs, although they were found in the oral and nasal swabs. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2013) could not recover infectious brusal disease virus in the exhaled air of infected broilers. These results indicate that some microorganisms in animal respiratory tracts might not readily become suspended in the air or be expelled out of the body, which implies that this is perhaps not an major source of airborne microorganisms as compared to animal feces (Zhao et al., 2013) . However, the reason the microorganisms may not be detected could be because the quantities of exhaled microorganisms were below the detection limit of the sampling devices. Therefore, animal respiratory tracts can only be excluded as a source of airborne microorganisms until it has been incontrovertibly established that every single microorganism is detectable.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 185, "text": "(Edwards et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 504, "end": 525, "text": "(Fabian et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 526, "end": 554, "text": "Weber and Stilianakis, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 736, "end": 773, "text": "Cho et al.

For concerns in occupational health, particle sizes are categorized into three categories: inhalable (<100 \u03bcm), thoracic (<10 \u03bcm), and respirable (<4 \u03bcm or 5 \u03bcm; Cambra-Lopez et al., 2010; Curtis et al., 1975; Madelin and Wathes, 1989; Zhang, 2004) . In environmental science, recent research is increasingly focusing on dust with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 \u03bcm (PM 10 ) and 2.5 \u03bcm (PM 2.5 ). The size distribution of airborne dust has been expressed either in mass or in counts. Zhao et al. (2011a) found that in three pig houses about 73-95% of the airborne bacteria were in the nonrespirable range ( Figure 1) . A similar result was reported by Curtis et al. (1975) : nonrespirable bacteria accounted for approximately 78-89% of the airborne bacteria in pig houses. The size distribution of microorganisms in poultry houses depends on the type of housing system. In broiler rooms with wood-shaving litter, most of the bacteria were nonrespirable in the full life cycle of broilers (eight weeks); a similar distribution pattern was found in broiler rooms with raised netting floor only after the birds were older than six weeks. When the birds were two to five weeks old, the proportions of airborne respirable and nonrespirable bacteria were similar (Madelin and Wathes, 1989) . Heber et al. (1988a) reported that nonrespirable particles (>4 \u03bcm) in pig houses accounted for more than 80% in mass, but less than 30% in terms of count. Expressed as percentage of total dust, Lai et al.

The equivalent figures for PM 2.5 mass were 1-3% in pig houses, 2-8% in poultry houses (2009), and 5% in cattle houses. For PM 25 counts the figures were 90-99% in pig houses, 88-92% in poultry houses and 99% in cattle houses.

The wavelength of UV between 10 nm and 120 nm has the highest energy, but this type of UV is blocked by normal dioxygen in air and cannot reach the ground. The rest of UV radiation, from low to high energy, is categorized as UV-A (320-400 nm), UV-B (280-320 nm), and UV-C (100-280 nm), of which UV-C is considered to be the most germicidal. The UV-C wavelength between 250-270 nm can be effectively absorbed by microbial genetic material, and is the UV wavelength most lethal to microorganisms (Keyser et al., 2008) . The germicidal effect of UV-C light on bacteria and viruses is primarily due to the formation of pyrimidine (thymine and cytosine) dimers that inhibit the replication and function of genetic material (Giese and Darby, 2000; Prescott et al., 2005) . Bacteria decay more readily under UV radiation than RNA viruses (Harris et al., 1987; Hijnen et al., 2006) . The probable reason for this is that the thymine of bacterial DNA is more vulnerable to dimerization induced by UV than the uracil of viral RNA. The mechanism whereby UV-A and UV-B (also called near-UV) inactivates microorganisms is suspected to be the breaks in strands of genetic materials that are induced by the UV itself and toxic tryptophan photoproducts (Prescott et al., 2005) . Visible light may also damage microorganisms. Microbial pigments become excited when they absorb light energy, and are transferred to O 2 , generating singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), which is a highly reactive oxidant (Valduga et al., 1993) .

Therefore, particle deposition (in the respiratory tract) refers to the \"mean probability\" of an inspired particle being collected on airway surfaces. Particle deposition in the respiratory tract depends on particle characteristics (e.g., size, shape, density) and breathing pattern (e.g., nasal/oral breath, respiratory flow rate, cycle period), and is commonly expressed as a function of particle size. Particle deposition in the human respiratory tract has been well documented (Brown et al., 2002; James et al., 1991; Lippmann et al., 1980) . In principle, the deposition of particles is governed by the mechanisms of diffusion for particles <0.1 \u03bcm, or by diffusion and sedimentation for 0.1-1 \u03bcm particles, or by sedimentation and impaction for particles >1 \u03bcm (Heyder, 2004) . On the basis of previous experimental studies, Heyder et al. (1986) developed a semiempirical deposition model for particles ranging from 0.005 \u03bcm to 15 \u03bcm. The model-simulated deposition pattern for slow inspiration over a long period for both oral and nasal breathing is shown in Figure 2 . The deposition has been shown for three regions of the respiratory tract-extra-thoracic, bronchial, and alveolar-based on how far down the tract particles may be deposited. In addition, total deposition is given (the sum of the deposition in the three regions). It can be seen that the total deposition is least for particles of 0.1-1 \u03bcm, and that the deposition increases as the size of small particles (<0.1 \u03bcm) decreases, and the size of the larger particles (>1 \u03bcm) increases.

However, this model was compromised by several assumptions that were made by the authors (e.g., laminar airflow in the respiratory tract, equal expansion of all lobes and alveoli, and complete mixing of the particles in the alveoli.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 186, "text": "(Corbanie et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 268, "end": 292, "text": "Harper and Morton (1953)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 760, "end": 789, "text": "Schreider and Hutchens (1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 919, "end": 928, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Particle Deposition in Respiratory Tract of Humans and Animals"}, {"text": "Hayter and Besch (1974) investigated the regional deposition of five particle sizes (0.091, 0.176, 0.312, 1.1, and 3.7 to 7 \u03bcm) in chicken.

These early data of particle deposition in chicken airways are suspected to be compromised by the use of anesthetized chickens, because anesthesia alters the animals' breathing pattern. Corbanie et al. (2006) investigated the deposition of particles in a wider range (1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcm) in unanaesthetized chickens of three ages.

Infection is likely to fit a single-hit model, which means that one pathogenic microorganism may trigger an infection in a recipient. From this point of view, the infective dose (ID; or occurrence of infection) is therefore related to the probability that a recipient becomes infected after taking in a certain dose of pathogenic microorganisms, following a Poisson distribution. The ID of pathogenic microorganisms to human and animals has generally been expressed in two ways. In one way, ID is expressed as the number of infected recipients out of a population after a dose of microorganisms has been administered. The other way is to determine the microbial concentrations required to infect 50% of a population (ID 50 ). Table 6 lists the ID of several pathogenic microorganisms. The ID of the same microorganism varies, depending on the recipient animal species. For instance, a lower ID of FMD virus is needed to infect sheep and cattle than to infect a pigs (Alexandersen and Donaldson, 2002; Donaldson et al., 1987; Gibson and Donaldson, 1986) . It can be also seen that a certain dose of a microorganism is not always capable of infecting all recipients, probably because of a difference in the resistance of individual recipients (due to e.g., age, breed; Roy, 1980) . Furthermore, the route by which the microorganisms are administered may also be responsible for variation in ID (Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988; Zimmerman et al., 1993) . In previous studies, the administration routes were either nasally or orally, or via aerosols, and these reflect different deposition situations and regions for microorganisms in the respiratory tract. Nasal administration simulates infection because larger microbial particles are deposited in the upper airways, the oral ministration may simulate oral breathing, and the aerosol administration simulates infection because smaller microbial particles are deposited in deeper airways. It was reported that the microorganisms had preferential sites for multiplication and infection because of the complex vulnerability of regions in respiratory tracts (Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988; Druett et al., 1953; Druett et al., 1956) . This being so, infection occurs more readily when the microorganisms are administered to the more vulnerable region.

These different sampling principles have their advantages and disadvantages. Samplers using the impaction principle (e.g., Andersen Six Stage Impactor) can be used to distinguish the microorganisms according to their sizes (Andersen, 1958) . In addition, the bacteria impacted on agar plates may be directly incubated for viable counts. However, its susceptibility to overloading limits its sampling in livestock houses to short periods, which may result in nonrepresentative samples. The problem of overloading can be overcome by using samplers with the impingement principle, because the liquid samples may be decimally diluted and analyzed after sampling. A disadvantage of this sampler is that it may not be able to sample for a long time due to evaporation of the collection liquid (Lin et al., 1997) . Filtration is a user-friendly method in a practical situation, but not suitable for sampling microorganisms that are vulnerable to dehydration stress. A sampler with known efficiency is a prerequisite for a reliable evaluation of the microbial concentration. The efficiency of a bioaerosol sampler includes physical and biological efficiency. The physical efficiency describes how well nonviable airborne particles are aspirated by the device's inlet and transported to the collection medium, referred to as inlet sampling efficiency, and how well the bioaerosol sampler retains these particles in its medium, referred to as collection efficiency (Griffiths and Stewart, 1999; Nevalainen et al., 1992) . For particles in the range from 1 to 10 \u03bcm and an airflow rate between 0 and 500 cm s \u22121 , the inlet sampling efficiency of the Andersen Six Stage Impactor is 90-150% when the opening faces in direction of the air flow and 8-100% when it is oriented perpendicularly to the horizontal aerosol flow (Grinshpun et al., 1994) . The inlet efficiency of the AGI-30 for particles of 1 \u03bcm is close to 100%, but it is reduced to 70-90% for 5 \u03bcm particles and to 20-30% for 10 \u03bcm particles (Grinshpun et al., 1994) .

(2006) reported that spraying 60 ml m \u22122 of tap water, salt water, treated manure, microbial additive, soybean oil, artificial spice, and essential oil may all reduce particles in pig houses. These authors found an average reduction of 53% for airborne bacteria, 51% for fungi, and 30% for total dust. The substance for spraying found to be the most effective additive for reducing dust was soybean oil. In broiler rooms, Aarnink et al. (2009) reported that PM 10 reduction increased linearly from 55 to 85% when daily rapeseed oil application rates increased from 6 to 24 ml m \u22122 . The PM 2.5 reduction was not related to application rate and was about 80%. In aviary systems for layers, a 34% reduction for PM 10 and 50% reduction for PM 2.5 were achieved by daily spraying with 20 ml m \u22122 . Although a high oil application rate achieves high PM 10 reduction in broiler rooms, it may adversely affect animal health . When spraying 24 ml m \u22122 daily, there was a tendency for statistically higher footpad lesion in broilers. Aarnink et al. (2009) recommended limiting oil application to 16 ml m \u22122 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 175, "text": "(Pearson and Sharples, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 178, "end": 196, "text": "Gore et al.

Cambra-Lopez et al. (2009) reported that the technique produced average reductions of 36% for PM 10 and 10% for PM 2.5 . The disparity is probably caused by the different charging mechanisms to particles. The small particles (<0.1 \u03bcm) are charged by the thermal charging mechanism, which is proportional to the diameter; large particles (>0.5 \u03bcm) are charged by field charging mechanism, which is proportional to the square of the diameter (Bundy, 1984) .

Because dedusters are based on the centrifuge principle, they are more effective at removing larger particles than smaller ones. The deduster studied by Zhang et al.

An acid scrubber that uses sulfuric acid may achieve a 70% reduction of total bacteria . In a lab-scale experiment, Aarnink et al.

Because these factors play an interrelated role on the concentrations of microorganisms and dust, integrated research on the effects is required. \u2022 The microorganisms transmitted in the air suffer physical and biological decay. The physical decay largely depends on their size, and the biological decay is mainly determined by environmental factors, such as humidity, temperature, radiation, and toxic gases. In airborne transmission, microorganisms may be carried by dust particles that may protect microorganisms from biological decay. Knowledge of the role of dust in the transportation of microorganisms is still lacking, and needs to be expanded. \u2022 Microorganisms are deposited on different regions in the respiratory tract, mainly depending on their size. They have different preferred infection regions in the respiratory tract. The amount of microorganisms needed to induce an infection varies with microorganism species and animal species. \u2022 Reference methods for microorganism and dust sampling in animal houses need to be legislated.
