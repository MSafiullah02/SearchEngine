It was recognized that contraction of influenza sometimes produced beneficial effects in leukemic patients. These early observations predate the formal demonstration that influenza was, in fact, caused by a virus. In the 1950s clinical studies were initiated in which a range of human viruses was administered to cancer patients, including HBV, West Nile virus, adenovirus, and mumps virus. The clinical experience with this approach has been discussed in several excellent and extensive historic reviews 1, 2, 3.",

In an effort to reduce the side effects and to circumvent the inhibitory effects brought about by neutralizing immunity, several non\u2010human viruses entered the stage, including Newcastle disease virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. However, after the advent of new cytostatic drugs and the problematic attenuation of some candidate viruses, the oncolytic virus approach was largely abandoned.",

            "text": "The rise of gene therapy as a clinically feasible approach for treating human diseases led to a revival of the oncolytic virus therapy approach. The hope of the safe and efficacious use of viruses as anticancer agents has been fuelled by the (largely) incidental evidence of antitumor efficacy as well as by the history of safe use of several live virus vaccines. Moreover the recombinant DNA technology offers effective systems for reverse genetics in many virus families. This has allowed the design of new and potentially more efficacious oncolytic viruses, and even arming the replicative oncolytic viruses with therapeutic transgenes. In parallel, there has been a continued and expanding interest in the use of non\u2010human viruses for oncolytic virus therapy. There are two main reasons for this interest. The first is the absence of immunity against non\u2010human viruses in the human population. This may provide the viral oncolytic agent a head start by allowing the therapeutic virus to be administered without the risk that the pre\u2010existing neutralizing immunity inactivates the vector and frustrates transduction of tumor cells. The other reason is that many non\u2010human viruses have not been associated with diseases in humans. In addition, recombinant DNA technology offers the prospect of overcoming limitations imposed by viral pathogenicity in humans.",

Firstly, during the preclinical phase, there are the hazards associated with handling the viruses in the preclinical evaluation program. The level of containment required for such activities is dependent on the biosafety classification of the virus that is handled. The guidelines that currently exist for such \u201ccontained use\u201d activities require the use of dedicated laboratories. Such guidelines are standardized and widely adopted.",

            "text": "In clinical applications, there are two distinct categories of risks. The first and most visible is the category of risk associated with the (potential) hazard to the patient who receives the viruses as (part of the) therapy. Here the procedure for a proper assessment of the risks and (potential) benefits should not differ greatly from more conventional medical interventions. However, in addition to the patient's risk, the fact that the therapeutic agent is infectious and can potentially be shed from the patient bears the possibility of horizontal transfer of the viral therapeutic agent 4, 5. The latter risk category in the clinical use of viruses is summarized by the term \u201cenvironmental risk\u201d. For the use of oncolytic viruses, the environmental risk encompasses the chance and severity of undesirable effects that result from the clinical use of the therapeutic viruses on humans other than the patient (viz. any person not willfully exposed to the viral therapeutic agent, such as medical personnel, the patient's relatives, or other patients), or on susceptible animals (e.g. pet animals, livestock, poultry, or wildlife). The variety of potential environmental hazards and undesirable consequences is wide, and ranges from pathological effects (e.g. outbreaks of infectious disease on a short time scale to tumor\u2010formation upon exposure to murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) on a long\u2010time scale) to economic consequences (e.g. the risk of a country losing its Aujeszky's disease\u2010free status if suid herpesvirus 1 would be shed from a patient.) The use of oncolytic viruses therefore requires containment procedures to reduce such transfer and minimize the risks associated with it. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no general guidance exists for estimating and evaluating the environmental risks associated with the clinical use of non\u2010human viruses as therapeutic agent, for example in cancer therapy. The absence of guidelines for assessing the environmental risks seems at odds with the specific regulation that is in place for instance in xenotransplantation 6.",

The use of non\u2010human primates is constrained by ethical considerations, their small anatomical size, and their limited availability. Pigs are considered the most suitable alternative source.

If the virus would have, or would acquire, the capacity to spread horizontally from the patient to health care workers or the patients' relatives, it could become established in the human population. Although the authors are not aware of any examples of outbreaks of viruses as a consequence of intentional exposure of humans, recent history has provided several examples of spontaneous cross\u2010species transfer and establishment in a new host. Examples are discussed in detail elsewhere 5 and include, for example, the recent H1N1 \u201cSwine Flu\u201d influenza A virus 9, the SARS\u2010corona virus 10 and in the more distant past, the HIV lentiviruses 11, 12.",

Although there is a wide consensus on a moratorium on xenotransplantation, there seems to be no specific guidance for developing clinical strategies involving the deliberate administration of non\u2010human viruses with a therapeutic intent. The formulation of guidelines to ensure appropriate assessment of risk to the patient and the environment may be suitable to date. Such guidelines could come either as \u201cpoints to consider\u201d for the investigators or as more formal regulation. In this regard it is relevant to recognize that many of the viruses that are being developed are not by definition \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d (GMOs). Hence their use may not demand the environmental risk assessments that are part of the formal national or international (e.g. European) GMO regulations. Also, the EMEA ICH Considerations document \u201cOncolytic viruses\u201d (EMEA/CHMP/ICH/607698/2008) does not provide guidance relating the management of environmental risks: while it advises to consider barrier contraception for the duration of the clinical trial as a standard precaution to prevent person\u2010to\u2010person transmission, it does not address other environmental risks.

This vector replicates and efficiently expresses a transgene in culture and in solid tumor models in vivo. Analyses of high molecular weight DNA harvested from the tumor, spleen, lung, kidney, liver, and heart revealed the presence of the full\u2010length GFP transgene only in the tumor samples, and not in any of the non\u2010tumor tissues. These data show that spread of the RCR vector appears confined to the tumor tissue.

A single dose of RCR vector expressing the CD prodrug\u2010activating gene, followed by a single cycle of a 5\u2010FC, inhibited growth of pre\u2010established primary gliomas in mice without apparent damage to adjacent normal brain tissue.
