Individuals that have been in contact with an infected person are identified, asked to remain in quarantine and are being tested. However, manually following contact histories is labor-intensive, slow and incomplete, as chance encounters, e.g. in the public transport, can not be fully reconstructed. The emergence of digital solutions, which automatically reconstruct the duration and proximity of encounters, is highly promising to enhance established manual procedures with speed, efficiency, precision and full coverage of relevant contact history. Ultimately, such proximity tracing technologies have the potential to \"reduce transmission enough to achieve R 0 < 1 and sustained epidemic suppression, stopping the virus from spreading further\" [Ferretti et al., 2020] .",

Since a large percentage of the world's population carries smartphones, these approaches make use of the BLE technology. Contact advertisements regularly emitted from these devices are used to assess the proximity of encounters. For effectively containing the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is necessary to reliably translate the BLE signal strength measurements into risk estimates of infection transmission. In this letter, we propose a novel approach for this conversion task. Figure 1A illustrates a typical infection scenario, which is difficult to manage with manual contact tracing procedures. Here, an infected person enters a public place (e.g. a supermarket) and spends an extended amount of time in close proximity (< 2m) to the contact person. Both factors, namely the contact distance and the contact duration, influence the risk for the contact person of being infected.",

A: Typical infection scenario in a public space (e.g. a supermarket), where close contact (< 2m) between an infected and a contact person is established over a long enough period of time. B: An epidemiological model translates a time series of contact distances into infectiousness scores, which are then used to label the encounters in the training dataset. C: Example of a raw RSS time series of the BLE signal, as well a corresponding contact distances. D: We train a linear regression model to predict the infectiousness scores obtained from a given risk model. The linear regression receives as input a list of features, which were derived from the raw rss data. E: The predictions of the linear regression model correlate strongly with the ground truth risk (up to 0.95 for the linear risk model). For a fixed critical risk threshold \u03b7 the approach achieves high true positive rates with very few false classifications. F: To this day only little is known about spreading behaviour of SARS-Cov-2. In this work, we calibrated our epidemiological models according to the latest recommendations of epidemiologists [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020].

Note that these ROC curves depend on the data labeling procedure, i.e., the epidemiological model and the threshold \u03b7. Here we used the assumed parameters for COVID-19, namely distance < 2 m and exposure time > 15 min [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020]. We provide mean and maximum RSS value as well as the number of received Bluetooth beacons as features to the linear regression model; results with other features derived from the RSS time series can be found in the supplementary materials. The AUC (area under the ROC curve) value of the predictor is found to be larger than 0.9 for all investigated epidemiological models. For the linear model AUCs of up to 0.96 were obtained. The prediction task becomes slightly more difficult for the box and sigmoid models, which assign only negligible risk to encounters above a certain distance. The repetition of this analysis on data recorded on another day led to very similar performance results, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed approach (see supplementary materials). Figure 1F displays RSS sequence data 3 along with the classification decisions of linear classifiers, which were trained to match the predictions of three different epidemiological models. These classification decisions also depend on the corresponding thresholds \u03b7. Clearly, once proximity tracing technologies will be rolled out for the broad population, the true infection events will be observed (given data donations and consent of all users involved). Comparing the observed infections with the predicted ones 4 will provide evidence for the true (and currently unknown) epidemiological modeling assumptions.",

Note that while we have assumed the standard modeling of viral spread with the currently agreed on parameters (distance < 2 m and exposure time > 15 min, see [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020]), it may in fact be conceivable that these parameters are not chosen conservatively enough in the light of recent results on contagious droplet spreading across larger distances rsp. in aerosols (see e.g. [Bourouiba, 2020] ) and moreover the improved binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 [Wrapp et al., 2020]. Clearly, once proximity tracing technologies will be rolled out for the broad population, then data transmission events will become available that will provide evidence for the true epidemiological modeling assumptions.
