            "text": "A new coronavirus was discovered due to detection of an unfamiliar pneumonia in a group of patients in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 7 January. Researchers sequenced the genome of new virus and figured out 86.9% of the genome is the same as SARS-CoV genome [1] . Afterwards the name was changed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . According to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report -71 (Data as reported by 10:00 CET 31 March 2020) 750 890 cases were globally confirmed and 36 405 persons died [3] . International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recently classified 28 unique species into 4 genera: alpha-CoVs, beta-CoVs, gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs. Mammals can be infected by alpha and beta whereas, gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs are able to afflict birds and also humans [1, 4] . 7 corona viruses responsible for respiratory complications in humans have been discovered so far (HCoVs). The new corona virus recently spread world-wide is considered a beta-CoVs genus. Before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, coronaviruses weren't regarded as highly pathogenic for human [1] . Phenotypic methods like culture, electron microscopy and serological studies are employed to recognize the virus, so coronaviruses were identified as pleomorphic, enveloped viruses containing crown-shaped peplomers with 80-160 nM in size and 27-32 kb positive polarity [4, 5] . As a result of many researches carried out, the structure of coronavirus genome is properly known. There are four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). These proteins beside other helper proteins account for One-third of the genome, the other twothird encodes viral polymerase (RdRp), RNA synthesis materials and ORF1a-ORF1b (two types of huge nonstructural proteins) [4] . S protein is on the surface of the virus and shape the virus as a crown. S protein's function is making an interaction between the sensitized cell and the virus then the genome can enter the cell. In cytoplasm, genomic RNA encodes various structural and non-structural polypeptide genes. Shape of the virus is reforming along with alterations in S-proteincoding genes. The E and M types function as small transmembrane proteins. Nucleocapsid (N) is used for cloning and generation of recombinant proteins. CoVs extremely recombine which is the outcome of repetitively developing transcription errors and RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) jumps [4, 5] .",

It appears that the infection was first transmitted through zoonotic agents (from animal to human). Despite the sea food market being closed, rates of infected patients increased, which indicated human-to-human transmission.",

At first people may complain of diarrhea and nausea. A few days later, they develop fever. Fever is usually detected in patients but it is not the main symptom. Headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are some of the less common symptoms. ICU care is required for aged patients or patients likely to have comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular disorders. Subsequent problems during hospitalization are mostly acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia, and shock. According to scientific observations, as the status of patient gets worse, urea and creatinine blood levels gradually rised [9, 10] . Another common symptom in patients is lymphopenia that possibly is a serious issue during hospitalization so there may be correlation between lymphopenia and severity or mortality of the disease [11] .",
