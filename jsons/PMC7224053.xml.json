Countries with a rapid development, as China, are displaying a remarkable increase in childhood obesity, with the number of overweight and obese Chinese children aged 7\u201318 years increasing by 28 times from 1985 to 2000 [3]. In the United States, the prevalence of obesity in the pediatric population reaches 18.5%, affecting almost 14 million of children and adolescents [4]. In Italy, about 21% of children are overweight and 10% are obese, with obesity trends expected to increase further [5]. A similar trend emerged in a previous ultrasonographic study in children and adolescents in southern Italy [6]. Obese children have a fivefold increased risk to stay obese during adulthood, as compared to normal-weight children [7, 8]. Infancy and childhood are critical moments in which key metabolic changes occur with health effects later in life. Both the children born large for gestational age or small for gestational age have the risk to develop obesity and metabolic consequences (Fig. 1). Genetic factors play only a minor role whilst social, economic, and environmental factors drive the increase of the obesity prevalence. The role of epigenetic factors at an early age is also important in determining adulthood metabolic abnormalities [9\u201313]. Table 1 depicts the potential weight-related comorbidities in obese children. Obese children are more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [14\u201317], metabolic alterations [18, 19], orthopedic complications, and psychosocial disorders, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, social isolation, and poor academic performance [20]. In addition, obese children may show abnormalities in the liver, reproductive system, brain, as well as increased blood pressure, impaired gluco-lipid metabolism, and sleep apnea. Thus, the priority is to design preventive measures to halt the number of obese children becoming unhealthy during adulthood [21].",

For children over 2 years, the diagnosis is based on the use of BMI using the WHO 2006 reference curves up to 5 years, and the WHO 2007 reference curves thereafter. The diagnosis of overweight is made for BMI values \u2265 85th percentile and < 95th percentile, while obesity is defined by BMI values \u2265 95th percentile [22, 23]. The 99th percentile is the cut-off used to define severe obesity since this value corresponds to a higher prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors and persistence of obesity later in life, as compared with lower percentiles [14]. However, the WHO terminology used to define severe obesity differs from younger (up to 5 years of age) compared to older children and adolescents. Indeed, the 99th percentile identifies obesity in the former group, and severe obesity in the latter. The different cut-off used to define these conditions is justified by the differences in growth process at different ages [24, 25].",

Twig et al. examined BMI in a cohort of 2,300,000 Israeli aged 16 and 19 years, in the search for a correlation between death and CVD later in life. In the 40-year follow-up, a correlation existed between increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in adults whose BMI increased during adolescence [33]. Baker et al. found similar results in a cohort of 276,853 Danish children. In particular, the increase of 1 unit in BMI Z score in 13-year-old children almost doubled the risk of adulthood CVD [34]. Bjorge et al. found a correlation of obesity with premature death, even if the critical age range associated with such increased risk remained uncertain [35]. Concerning the critical BMI threshold, Aune et al. conducted a meta-analysis of the available studies investigating the correlations of BMI with all-cause mortality. The nadir existed at BMI 23\u201324 kg/m2 among non-smokers, 22\u201323 kg/m2 among healthy non-smokers, and 20\u201322 kg/m2 when the analysis was limited to studies with longer durations of follow-up [36].",

            "text": "Due to the strong correlation between childhood obesity and the CVD risk during adulthood, several studies aimed to identify early markers of CVD. McGill et al. demonstrated the presence of early atherosclerotic lesions [37], which appear first in the distal aorta and then in the carotid arteries. Carotid intima\u2013media thickness (cIMT) is considered a valid marker of pre-clinical atherosclerosis, and several studies support its role as independent predictor of CVD even in asymptomatic subjects [38]. In addition, cIMT may be a good marker of cardiovascular alterations in children, although studies show some discrepancies [39]. Freedman et al. analyzed a cohort of 513 subjects and detected a positive correlation between BMI measured throughout life and cIMT at age of 35 years. These associations, however, were restricted to adults who continued to be obese. In particular, they found the BMI-CVD correlation to be weak before the age of 11 years, but it progressively increased with age, reaching the strongest correlation among adolescents aged 15\u201318 years [40]. Juonala et al. found no significant association between BMI measured at 3, 6, 9 or 15 years and cIMT 21 years later, even though a positive correlation existed with BMI at ages 12 and 18 [41]. In a longer follow-up, Wright et al. did not find any significant correlations between childhood BMI and cIMT at the age of 50 [42].",

            "text": "The raising prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome together with insulin resistance [43], worldwide is associated with liver abnormalities encompassing the clinical spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD occurs in the absence of other triggering factors such as hepatitis C, alcohol consumption, parenteral nutrition, or steatogenic drugs. Whereas nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)\u2014a relatively benign condition [44]\u2014implies more than 5% of fatty hepatocytes without hepatocellular injury, the term nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with fatty liver and hepatocellular injury revealed by the histological findings of hepatocyte ballooning, with or without fibrosis [45]. A third category is NASH cirrhosis, showing current or previous evidence of histologic NASH or NAFL. Ethnicity, age, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance [46, 47], dyslipidemia [48], high intake of dietary fructose [49\u201351], all influence the development of NAFLD [52], with males showing higher risk than females [53]. In children, NAFLD is now the most common cause of liver disease [54\u201356], and this trend is somewhat worrisome because even in children NASH may evolve to fibrosis, cirrhosis (as early as 8 years) [57, 58], and even liver failure [59\u201361]. This correlation NAFLD/NASH, however, seems weaker in children than adults, suggesting a milder phenotype of NAFLD [62]. Since adults with NAFLD have high risk to die from cardiovascular disease, clinicians and the public should be aware that children with NAFLD must receive a full evaluation to detect or prevent important comorbidities listed in Table 1, and including type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Based on elevated serum aminotransferases, imaging or liver biopsy, the prevalence of NAFLD in children and adolescents and in obese children ranges between 6 and 38%, depending on the context, the population studied, and the ethnicity (Table 2).",

Thus, physical examination should look for comorbidities, splenomegaly, and end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis). Serum abnormalities include elevated liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [8, 56, 58, 66, 67] which tend to improve upon adoption of healthy lifestyles (see below) [66, 68]. Notably, even in children with NASH the levels of aminotransferases may remain normal [69], and this possibility is intrinsic to the limited sensitivity and specificity of serum aminotransferase levels for clinically significant NAFLD. Due to the high and further raising prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in children, recent guidelines recommend the screening of obese children as the primary screening for NAFLD. Steps vary according to the existence of concomitant comorbidities and levels of serum transaminases (i.e., normal, moderate, and > 2 upper normal limit persistent elevation) [15]. At least in children, imaging techniques for the screening diagnosis of NAFLD are not routinely recommended [15, 70], due to poor sensitivity and specificity (ultrasonography) [71, 72], poor correlation with steatohepatitis, fibrosis (magnetic resonance) [73\u201375], or detection of only advanced fibrosis, costs, lack of definitive cut-off values and need validation (magnetic resonance elastography) [76]. The role of liver biopsy (which ultimately confirms the diagnosis of NAFLD and determines the severity of the fatty liver disease with the presence and extent of inflammation and fibrosis [15, 56]) needs to be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Cases should include forms of more progressive NAFLD, possibility of other liver diseases, and morbidly obese scheduled for bariatric surgery.",

            "text": "Physical inactivity affects a vast majority of children and adolescents who become prone to high obesity rates and related diseases, including CVD and NAFLD. Promotion of programs involving physical activity has, therefore, become a relevant topic in health policy. Messing et al. conclude that \u201cmulti-component interventions in childcare facilities and schools stand out prominently\u201d [79]. Molina\u2013Molina et al. have recently discussed several mechanisms for which physical inactivity might affect CVD [80]. Between ages 5\u20136 and 8\u20139, there are similar increases in physical inactivity for both boys and girls, as reflected in a British cohort of 57 primary schools [81]. Already during adolescence, physical activity starts to decrease, contrarily to body weight [82]. A series of factors such as dietary intake and sedentary behaviors contribute to childhood obesity [83]. The phenotype of obesity could differ depending on the children\u2019s age, gender, and family characteristics. Studies on television viewing and total recreational screen time in youth might be associated with adverse CVD risk factors, such as adiposity, increased triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome [84]. Other authors have linked sedentary time with diabetes and high blood pressure in obese and overweight adolescents [85, 86]. Several hours of television viewing by adolescents doubles the odds for metabolic syndrome later in adulthood, as observed in a study by Wennberg et al. [87]. Not only sedentary behaviors, but above 10 hours of night time sleep in primary school children from Germany was also associated with obesity [88].",
