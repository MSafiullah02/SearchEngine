Here, we report gene expression changes related to intestinal absorption or transport, the immune system and angiogenesis in response to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . Vitamin D deficient rats were intrajugularly given vehicle or vehicle containing 730 ng of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 /kg of body weight. Intestinal mRNA was harvested from duodenal mucosa at 15 min, 1, 3, and 6 h post-injection and studied by Affymetrix microarrays. Genes significantly affected by 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR with remarkable agreement. The most strongly affected gene in intestine was CYP24 with 97-fold increase at 6 h post-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 treatment. Intestinal calcium absorption genes: TRPV5, TRPV6, calbindin D 9k , and Ca 2+ dependent ATPase all were upregulated in response to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 , supporting the currently accepted mechanism of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 induced transcellular calcium transport. However, a 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 suppression of several intra-/intercellular matrix modeling proteins such as sodium/potassium ATPase, claudin 3, aquaporin 8, cadherin 17, and RhoA suggests a vitamin D regulation of tight junction permeability and paracellular calcium transport. Several other genes related to the immune system and angiogenesis whose expression was changed in response to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 provided evidence for an immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic role of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The active form of vitamin D 3 , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 or calcitriol (1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 ), 1 is a seco-steroid hormone that in association with high affinity vitamin D 3 receptor (VDR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, transactivates or transrepresses a variety of genes [1] [2] [3] [4] . For decades the major physiologic function of vitamin D 3 was believed to be a stimulation of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption [1] . However, the detailed mechanism of vitamin D-induced intestinal cal- cium absorption is still not fully delineated. The current model of vitamin D-induced transcellular calcium absorption in intestine is the induction of (1) calcium channel proteins, TRPV5 and TRPV6 (transient receptor potential channels vaniloid subfamily, former names ECaC1 and ECaC2 [5] [6] [7] [8] ); (2) cellular calcium transfer protein, calbindin-D 9K [1, 4, 9] ; and (3) a calcium extrusion protein, calcium ATPase (PMCA 1b ) [10] . PMCA 1b has been implicated in the regulation of calcium absorption by vitamin D, but its expression is not as tightly regulated by 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 as that of TRPV5 and TRPV6 and calbindin-D 9K .
