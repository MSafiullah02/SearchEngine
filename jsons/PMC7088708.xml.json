On January 7, 2020, researchers rapidly isolated a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as 2019-nCoV) from confirmed infected pneumonia patients. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and next-generation sequencing were used to characterize it.2 On January 23, 2020, owing to the large flow of people during the Chinese Spring Festival, public transport was suspended in Wuhan and, eventually, in all the cities in Hubei Province to reduce the risk of further transmission.",

Other coronaviruses have been shown to persist for days on uncleaned surfaces.10 Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the stool specimen in a person who had symptoms while the serum specimen tested negative.13 Recently, SARS-Cov-2 was isolated from a swab sample of a confirmed patient\u2019s feces by Chinese researchers,14 indicating the potential for fecal-oral transmission. Studies have shown effective person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV even in the presence of isolation efforts in medical facilities.15, 16 A case series of nine infected pregnant women did not reveal evidence of third trimester vertical transmission after cesarian section.17 Transmission in health settings is a very serious threat.

Supportive treatment for complicated patients has included continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), invasive mechanical ventilation, and even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). No specific antiviral drugs have been confirmed effective. The first reported patient with 2019-nCoV infection in the USA was treated with remdesivir,13 and others have used antiretrovirals like ritonavir, with trials of both in progress.22 A recent study conducted by the \u201cfront-line\u201d health care providers combating COVID-19 in Wuhan indicated that systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefit.23 Baricitinib has been suggested as a potential drug for the treatment in the hope that it might reduce the process of both virus invasion and inflammation.24",
