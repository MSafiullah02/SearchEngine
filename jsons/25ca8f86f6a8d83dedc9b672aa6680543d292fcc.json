In this study, we proposed a comparative analysis approach and built a model to simulate outbreaks of 3 different in-flight infections in a similar cabin environment, that is, influenza A H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), and norovirus. The simulation results seemed to suggest that the close contact route was probably the most significant route (contributes 70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%-72%) in the inflight transmission of influenza A H1N1 transmission; as a result, passengers within 2 rows of the index case had a significantly higher infection risk than others in the outbreak (relative risk [RR]: 13.4, 95% CI: 1.5-121.2, P = .019). For SARS CoV, the airborne, close contact, and fomite routes contributed 21% (95% CI: 19%-23%), 29% (95% CI: 27%-31%), and 50% (95% CI: 48%-53%), respectively.

The surface contamination network in air cabin has a community structure.

Firstly, many major assumptions were made for the model parameters, and some are judgment-based and not well supported by evidence or data. For example, the SARS CoV dose-response rate obtained in the mice experiments was applied to humans. In addition, the surface-touching behavior, which is necessary when building a surface contamination network, is expected to vary very significantly, but we assumed that the same behavior is applied uniformly both in time and for individuals during the entire flight. The surface contamination network may be improved as more behavior data become available.Furthermore, the distribution and the constraints for each parameter set that were used might also not be realistic. These assumptions may challenge the conclusion that the fomite route is the dominant one for norovirus. Secondly, only one outbreak was available for our analysis for each virus. Generalization of findings due to one outbreak is questionable. Lastly, we have not considered the possibility of infection before and after the flight, such as during check-in and in the lounge, which suggests that our analysis might have overestimated the overall in-flight risk.Our comparative analysis approach for multiple outbreaks and viruses differs from the traditional individual analysis of an outbreak.1 The same mechanisms of fomites (eg, surface or object contamination network) and bioaerosol transport (ie, close contact and airborne) are applied to all 3 pathogens in the cabin, with the only differences in the pathogen-specific parameters (inactivation rate, surface transfer efficiency, etc.).

Our simulation results have some aspects that are similar to the outbreak data in terms of the spatial distribution of secondary cases. Although with uncertainties, the simulation results suggested that for in-flight influenza A H1N1 transmission, the airborne and close contact routes may be much more important than the fomite route; for SARS CoV, although the fomite route is slightly more important than the other routes, it is not dominant and all 3 transmission routes are found to be important; for norovirus transmission, the fomite route may be dominant.

But due to the high ventilation rate (25 per hour) and HEPA filter efficiency of ventilation system in the aircraft, and the close contact route is shown to be probably the most significant in in-flight influenza transmission, the infection risk for passengers sitting close to the index case(s) is significantly high than others. In addition, a review study on human influenza transmission of Brankston et al 31 concluded that transmission of influenza occurs at close range rather than over a long distance. Of the 5 in-flight influenza A H1N1 outbreaks reviewed, with detailed distribution of the secondary cases included, 4 showed that the passenger sitting within the first 2 rows of the ill passenger(s) had a higher infection risk than others. The 2009 WHO guidance recommends the contact tracing of passengers seated within 2 rows of an infectious case of influenza during air travel.29 The air change rate and efficiency of the HEPA filter are relatively high in the aircraft ventilation system than other typical indoor environments, so that the airborne pathogens can be removed effectively. In most reported in-flight influenza A H1N1 outbreaks, the attack rate is low (1%-5%), but in the seasonal influenza A outbreak in March 1977, when the air conditioning system of a commercial airliner was shut down due to a malfunctioning engine, the attack rate reached 72%.32 Compared with the influenza A H1N1 virus, the SARS CoV has a much lower inactivation rate on environmental surfaces and skin, which is probably why the fomite route is more important in SARS CoV transmission than that in influenza A H1N1 transmission.
