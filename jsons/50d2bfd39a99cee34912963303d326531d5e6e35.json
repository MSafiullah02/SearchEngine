            "text": "L\u00e9vy walks (LWs) are spatiotemporally coupled random-walk processes describing superdiffusive heat conduction in solids, propagation of light in disordered optical materials, motion of molecular motors in living cells, or motion of animals, humans, robots, and viruses. We here investigate a key feature of LWs, their response to an external harmonic potential. In this generic setting for confined motion we demonstrate that LWs equilibrate exponentially and may assume a bimodal stationary distribution. We also show that the stationary distribution has a horizontal slope next to a reflecting boundary placed at the origin, in contrast to correlated superdiffusive processes. Our results generalize LWs to confining forces and settle some long-standing puzzles around LWs. 05.30.Pr, 02.50.Ng, 05.10.Gg Anomalous diffusion with mean squared displacement (MSD) x 2 (t) \u2243 t \u03b1 , whose anomalous diffusion exponent differs from the value \u03b1 = 1 of Brownian motion, are ubiquitously observed in a wide range of systems [1][2][3]. Subdiffusion with 0 < \u03b1 < 1 occurs in amorphous semiconductors [4] , artificially crowded liquids [5] , lipid bilayer membranes [6] [7] [8] , cytoplasm of biological cells [9, 10] , or in hydrology [11] . Superdiffusion with \u03b1 > 1 is observed in active systems such as molecular motor transport in cells [12] [13] [14] or in turbulence [15] . One of the central stochastic models for both regimes of anomalous diffusion is the continuous time random walk (CTRW), based on the two identically distributed random variables of the waiting times \u03c4 in between any two jumps and the single jump lengths x [1, 4, 16, 17] . In the hydrodynamic limit uncoupled CTRW processes in an external potential can be conveniently described in terms of time-and/or space-fractional Fokker-Planck equations [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

The scale-free nature of \u03bb(x) translates into a diverging MSD, but transport can be characterized in terms of fractional order moments |x| \u03ba 2/\u03ba \u2243 t 2/\u00b5 [17] . Due to their fractal, clustering motion pattern LFs are often used as efficient random search mechanisms, e.g., for foraging animals [21, 22] . In harmonic external potentials LFs have a stationary state yet diverging MSD [20] . In steeper than harmonic potentials LFs assume multimodal stationary PDFs with finite MSD but diverging higher-order moments [23] . A physically more pleasing CTRW concept for superdiffusion are L\u00e9vy walks (LWs), based on a spatiotemporal coupling of jump lengths and waiting times with a finite propagation speed and finite MSD [24, 25] . This property makes them ideal candidates for the description of anomalous heat transport [26] , transport in Lorentzlike gases [27] , and light propagation in disordered optical media [28] . LWs were shown to be efficient search strategies [29, 30] , consistent with their first-hitting time prop-erties [31], and may emerge from deterministic nonlinear systems near a critical point [32]. Indeed, LWs are observed in molecular-motor motion [33], spreading of cancer cells [34], human hunter-gatherer foraging [35], pedestrian movement [36], and in optimized robotic search [37]. LWs underly human movement patterns [38] and were identified in the COVID-19 pandemic propagation [39].",

For constant external drift LWs are described by a fractional material derivative [43], for arbitrary external potentials LWs follow a generalized Kramers-Fokker-Planck equations [44] . The latter is hard to solve for concrete problems, as the Fourier-Laplace technique cannot be applied due to the spatiotemporal coupling. Here we report an explicit solution of LWs in a physically important harmonic potential. Answering some puzzles in LW theory, we demonstrate that the PDF relaxes exponentially to a stationary limit with a plateau value of the MSD that is independent of the exact formulation of the LW. We moreover demonstrate that the stationary PDF is bimodal in a wide parameter range. When the process approaches a regular random walk a monomodal stationary PDF is restored. The PDF is also shown to have a horizontal asymptote in the presence of a reflecting boundary placed at the origin.",

For the last step (n, such that t n + \u03c4 > t), we also need the absolute value |x t | as the end point of the walk. In order to solve this problem, we first construct an auxiliary process, whose last step is x t instead of |x t |.",

Apart from being experimentally relevant, our results answer the conceptual question whether and how LWs equilibrate in soft confinement. Our analysis shows that LWs under harmonic confinement equilibrate to a stationary PDF, that, surprisingly, may be bimodal with peak locations x = \u00b1v 0 /\u03c9. However, the bimodality delicately depends on the model parameters. When the LW approaches a regular random walk, monomodality is restored. For exponential and uniform \u03c6(\u03c4 ) we also demonstrated that the stationary PDF in these limits becomes Gaussian. While the stationary value of the MSD is independent of the chosen form of \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and thus in all cases the tails of the stationary PDF always decay sufficiently fast, higher order moments depend on \u03c6(\u03c4 ). This was discussed for the fourth-order moment entering the kurtosis K. Our results for K show that the stationary PDF is always platykurtic.",

We here investigate a key feature of LWs, their response to an external harmonic potential. In this generic setting for confined motion we demonstrate that LWs equilibrate exponentially and may assume a bimodal stationary distribution. We also show that the stationary distribution has a horizontal slope next to a reflecting boundary placed at the origin, in contrast to correlated superdiffusive processes. Our results generalize LWs to confining forces and settle some long-standing puzzles around LWs. Anomalous diffusion with mean squared displacement (MSD) x 2 (t) \u2243 t \u03b1 , whose anomalous diffusion exponent differs from the value \u03b1 = 1 of Brownian motion, are ubiquitously observed in a wide range of systems [1] [2] [3] . Subdiffusion with 0 < \u03b1 < 1 occurs in amorphous semiconductors [4] , artificially crowded liquids [5] , lipid bilayer membranes [6] [7] [8] , cytoplasm of biological cells [9, 10] , or in hydrology [11] . Superdiffusion with \u03b1 > 1 is observed in active systems such as molecular motor transport in cells [12] [13] [14] or in turbulence [15] . One of the central stochastic models for both regimes of anomalous diffusion is the continuous time random walk (CTRW), based on the two identically distributed random variables of the waiting times \u03c4 in between any two jumps and the single jump lengths x [1, 4, 16, 17] . In the hydrodynamic limit uncoupled CTRW processes in an external potential can be conveniently described in terms of time-and/or space-fractional Fokker-Planck equations [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

For constant external drift LWs are described by a fractional material derivative [43] , for arbitrary external potentials LWs follow a generalized Kramers-Fokker-Planck equations [44] . The latter is hard to solve for concrete problems, as the Fourier-Laplace technique cannot be applied due to the spatiotemporal coupling. Here we report an explicit solution of LWs in a physically important harmonic potential. Answering some puzzles in LW theory, we demonstrate that the PDF relaxes exponentially to a stationary limit with a plateau value of the MSD that is independent of the exact formulation of the LW. We moreover demonstrate that the stationary PDF is bimodal in a wide parameter range. When the process approaches a regular random walk a monomodal stationary PDF is restored. The PDF is also shown to have a horizontal asymptote in the presence of a reflecting boundary placed at the origin.",

Apart from being experimentally relevant, our results answer the conceptual question whether and how LWs equilibrate in soft confinement. Our analysis shows that LWs under harmonic confinement equilibrate to a stationary PDF, that, surprisingly, may be bimodal with peak locations x = \u00b1v 0 /\u03c9. However, the bimodality delicately depends on the model parameters. When the LW approaches a regular random walk, monomodality is restored. For exponential and uniform \u03c6(\u03c4 ) we also demonstrated that the stationary PDF in these limits becomes Gaussian. While the stationary value of the MSD is independent of the chosen form of \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and thus in all cases the tails of the stationary PDF always decay sufficiently fast, higher order moments depend on \u03c6(\u03c4 ). This was discussed for the fourth-order moment entering the kurtosis K. Our results for K show that the stationary PDF is always platykurtic.",
