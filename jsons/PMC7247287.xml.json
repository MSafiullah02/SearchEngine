            "text": "Key considerations in this risk assessment include:\nVehicle availability. Preparing and decontaminating vehicles compromises vehicle availability, and alternatives to aeromedical transport (or transporting the retrieval team to the patient by helicopter and returning by ambulance) should be considered.Increased risk of occupational transmission in an enclosed aircraft cabin. Aerosolizing procedures like Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and nebulization may pose high risks particularly in confined cabins [8]. Particular concern has been raised that NIV might raise the risk of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV2 [9]. Patients requiring these therapies may require alternative management during transport, and a low threshold for intubation is advocated [8].Management of asymptomatic patients. Personal correspondence with other retrieval services has suggested that HEMS crew members have inadvertently been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by patients in whom the initial tasking seemed unrelated to respiratory disease. Some retrieval services have therefore suggested that all patients transported during this pandemic should wear a surgical mask if spontaneously breathing, due to their proximity with the crew and the potential for a mask to limit droplet spread [10]. In areas with community transmission, if patients require NIV or High-Flow Nasal Oxygen, transport by road rather than helicopter should be considered, even if the patient is deemed low risk for COVID-19. Turnaround times for testing for COVID-19 may be delayed in rural areas: in this context all patients with respiratory compromise should be treated as potential COVID-19 patients. Aeromedical services may have a role in expediting testing for COVID-19 by delivering and collecting sample kits from rural areas.Service continuity. The pandemic will inevitably result in staff infections or isolations. Almost 9% of COVID-19 cases in Italy have been in healthcare workers [11]. This may disproportionately impact HEMS services, which are reliant on a small group of highly trained individuals who are not easily replaceable.",

However, it is of utmost importance that those involved accept and understand the steps required to safely transport COVID-19 patients. Frequent liaison between prehospital and hospital services is important. In some circumstances, roles and responsibilities may change from daily practice, with prehospital and hospital staff assisting one another to ensure appropriate management of their patients.",

We strongly advocate the use of simulation to help identify such oversights, as well as in preparing staff and systems for treating such patients [6].",

Further evaluation and research should be conducted as the pandemic evolves so that we can learn more about how to safely move critically unwell patients by air.",
