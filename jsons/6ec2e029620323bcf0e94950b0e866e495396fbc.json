From faeces, there are three primary routes for the virus: to water, to surfaces or to places where insect vectors are present.

This route may be of interest for a possible faecal-inhalation route of SARS-CoV-2, since researches have been raising the possibility of virus spread via wastewater plumbing systems, such as the spread of SARS coronavirus in sewage aerosols in a 50-storey residential building in Hong Kong (WHO 2003) and later on controlled experiments in a full-scale plumbing test-rig (Gormley et al. 2020). However, these more recent developments in associating water to respiratory diseases have not fully captured the complex routes possibly involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person.",
