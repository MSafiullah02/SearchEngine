All subjects were seen in a refractory obstructive lung disease clinic by an asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease expert. Subjects were consented at the time of preoperative clinic visits. Pulmonary function tests were performed with methacholine (MCh) challenge before surgery. All surgeries were elective and for noninfectious or noninflammatory reasons: most of the surgeries were performed on obese patients and were bariatric in nature. One of the surgeries was for a thyroid nodule. Most of the donors showed no symptoms of comorbidities, except asthmatic patient 4, who was given a diagnosis of kyphoscoliosis. All bronchoscopies were done for research purposes only. Detailed clinical characteristics of the donors have been provided in Tables I and II\n. Details of healthy control subjects are provided in Table III\n. BALF was concentrated 10 times with Ultracel 10K cutoff concentrating centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Temecula, Calif).",

We first determined influx of inflammatory cells in the airway lumen. There was a significant infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways of Ptx3\n+/+ and Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice after OVA challenge; however, Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a greater number of total inflammatory cells (n = 12; P < .01; Fig 2\n, A, and Table IV\n). Although both genotypes showed an eosinophil-dominant response on OVA challenge, Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited greater BALF eosinophil counts (Fig 2, B, and Table IV) and lung tissue eosinophilia (Siglec Fhigh/Gr-1low/\u2212; Fig 2, E and F) compared with their Ptx3\n+/+ counterparts. Greater neutrophil counts in the airways and lungs (CD11b+/Gr-1+) were also detected in Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with their Ptx3+/+ counterparts (Fig 2, B, G, and H, respectively).12 Enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding the airways and blood vessels in Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with Ptx3\n+/+ mice was further supported by an examination of H&E-stained lung sections (Fig 2, I).",

A key conclusion that has emerged from these findings is that PTX3 provides protection against specific infections, including SARS, P aeruginosa, CMV, pneumonia, and aspergillosis.9 The role of PTX3 has not been previously studied in the mucosal adaptive immune response, particularly in asthmatic patients. In this report we revealed an association between PTX3 and allergic inflammation, as observed in asthmatic patients. Consistent with our BALF data from patients with severe allergic asthma, the lungs of allergen-exposed mice displayed a highly significant increase in the level of PTX3 compared with those of saline-treated control mice. These findings are in agreement with our previously reported data in bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from patients with severe asthma.10 For the first time, we demonstrate that features of allergic asthma, such as AHR, airway remodeling, and inflammation, were heightened in the absence of PTX3 in a murine model of OVA-induced experimental asthma. Moreover, absence of PTX3 promotes a TH17-dominant CD4 T-cell response in the lungs combined with enhanced survival of CD4 T cells, suggesting a critical function of PTX3 in preferential maintenance of the specific CD4 T-cell population, at least in OVA-induced inflammation. Enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-23 by DCs from mice deficient in PTX3, a TH17-inducing proinflammatory cytokine, provides a mechanistic explanation accounting for an IL-17A\u2013dominant allergic inflammation in these mice. Collectively, our data suggest a hitherto unrecognized function of PTX3 in regulation of events involved in the pathogenesis of asthma-associated allergic inflammation.",

It is likely that a unique phenotype of CD4 T cells from Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, as observed in inflammation, can result from alteration of other cell types. DCs constitute major antigen (allergen)\u2013presenting cells to T cells in allergic inflammation. Besides presenting allergen epitopes and providing costimulatory signals, they regulate the phenotype and functions of CD4 T cells through cytokine production. DCs produce IL-6 and IL-23, through which these cells dictate differentiation of naive CD4 T cells to TH17 CD4 T cells through activation of STAT3-dependent pathway.25, 58 Increased numbers of IL-6\u2013 and IL-23\u2013producing DCs in the lungs of Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice on OVA exposure explain the enhanced differentiation of TH17 cells in OVA-exposed Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with that seen in wild-type control mice.

The IL-17A\u2013dominant immune response has previously been associated with steroid-resistant severe asthma in human subjects.60 Therefore our study might provide some novel insight into understanding the mechanisms involved in regulation of the IL-17A\u2013dominant immune response in patients with severe asthma. Based on our current data, it is difficult to infer whether PTX3 treatment would provide protection against unwarranted allergen-induced activation of immune system. However, our data clearly show that deletion of PTX3 plays a critical role in regulating functional capacity of immune system, thereby affecting immunologic metrics in response to an allergen in a murine model of experimental asthma.Key messages\n\u2022PTX3 levels increase in the airways of patients with severe asthma and OVA-exposed mice.\u2022Deletion of PTX3 results in enhanced inflammation, AHR, and mucus production on OVA sensitization and challenge.\u2022OVA exposure induces a TH17-dominant immune response in Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with Ptx3\n+/+ mice.\u2022On OVA exposure, CD4 T cells from Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit an enhanced survival in contrast to Ptx3\n+/+ mice.\u2022DCs from Ptx3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice produce greater levels of the TH17-polarizing cytokines IL-6 and IL-23, plausibly promoting TH17-dominant inflammation in the PTX3-depleted condition.\n\n",
