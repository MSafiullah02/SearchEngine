In particular, we focused on 48 infections and pulmonary toxicities observed across the different FDA-approved JAKi for their FDA-49 approved indications. When available, data from phase II or III clinical trials for dermatological 50 indications was included. Table 1 shows the rates of various infections, including upper respiratory 51 infections, nasopharyngitis and influenza, for JAKi-treated groups versus placebo groups. Overall, rates 52 of infectious events are only mildly increased in JAKi-treated patients. We also collated pulmonary 53 toxicities of JAKi to identify potential risks of worsening severe respiratory disease from SARS-CoV-2, and 54 such toxicities are all but absent. 55 56 In order to understand the infection data, it is helpful to understand the mechanism and 57 pharmacokinetics of JAKi. Cytokines can drive autoimmunity when their activity is exaggerated ( Figure 3 1A). JAKi, which are taken orally 1-2 times per day, largely impact pathogenically elevated cytokine 59 activity, with relative sparing of normal cytokine activity because drug concentrations are sub-60 therapeutic for part of the day ( Figure 1B In this time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we must be as informed as possible regarding the risks of the 75 treatments we prescribe our patients. Of course, shared decision-making reigns supreme, but without 76 data we, as physicians, will be unable to provide our patients the guidance they rely on us for. ",
