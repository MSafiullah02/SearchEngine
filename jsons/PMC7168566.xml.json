The time from onset to dyspnea is 5 days, 7 days to hospital admission, and 10 days to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Fever, cough, and fatigue are the most common clinical manifestations. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, myalgia, sore throat, and headache. About 10% of patients initially present with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) 1 to 2 days prior to development of fever, cough, and dyspnea. Abnormal findings in chest X-ray and CT scan can be seen in 60% and > 90% of patients, respectively. The most common patterns on chest CT are ground-glass opacity and local or bilateral patchy shadowing [4\u20137]. Diagnosis can be confirmed by sequencing or reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 nucleic acid of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Notably, in a report from China on over 1000 patients to assess the diagnostic accuracy of different tests, chest CT scan had sensitivity of 98% compared with RT-PCR sensitivity of only 71% [8]. Major complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Overall, most cases are classified as mild (81%; i.e., nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia). However, 14% are severe and 5% are critical [4\u20137].",
