Proteins do not act alone; instead, they rely on complex interactions with other proteins and molecules to propagate signals leading to specific cellular responses. Given the breadth of protein species, high\u2010throughput methods are essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the proteome. A popular, high\u2010throughput technology for studying the proteome is the protein microarray. Simply defined, protein microarrays are microscopic tools that display hundreds to thousands of different proteins on a fixed substrate in a high\u2010density array format, which can then be queried and analyzed simultaneously 3, 4, 5, 6. Protein microarrays can be distinguished from other protein display methods, such as yeast and phage display, because the identity of the protein and its associated array address are known in advance. Protein microarrays have helped tackle routine challenges in other proteomics technologies, including low protein abundance, complicated assay procedures, difficulty in modulating assay environment, low sensitivity, and low\u2010throughput analysis of proteins 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.",

Translational research often includes the use of clinical samples with the intent to discover or validate potential biomarkers that will aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, stratification, and treatment of patients. In order to achieve adequate statistical power during biomarker discovery and validation, the analyses of tens to hundreds of different clinical samples are often required due to high biological variation among patients. The expense associated with analyzing so many samples was, in part, responsible for the modest adoption of protein microarrays in translational research. For example, the production and purification of thousands of different proteins is much more complex than producing DNA oligonucleotides for a gene microarray. In addition, protein microarrays must achieve very tight tolerances and high reproducibility both within and between batches in order to discern subtle differences across clinical samples. New strategies and improved manufacturing techniques have led to a rapid increase in the application of protein microarrays in translational research 16, 17, 18, 19.",

A recent hybrid system used bacteriophage to display barcoded peptides from human viruses to screen for antibodies that target these viral peptidomes and indicate the history of infection 23. Compared to standard protein microarrays that employ purified full\u2010length proteins, protein fragment and peptide microarrays are easier to produce due to their smaller sizes and simpler structures. Protein fragment arrays can also use antibody fragments lacking the Fc domain to probe for specific antigens in patient samples 6. The flexibility of the peptide microarray allows the incorporation of non\u2010natural amino acids and PTMs at specific sites or the use of unnatural peptide sequences 24. However, binding epitopes, especially conformational ones, may be lost with protein fragment and peptide microarrays.

These arrays have been referred to as purified, natural, and cell\u2010free expression protein microarrays (Fig. 1, Table 1). The most popular microarray format is the \u201cpurified protein microarray\u201d in which proteins are expressed in heterologous systems, such as insect cells, Escherichia coli, or yeast. The proteins are purified in a 96\u2010well plate format via a fusion tag, and subsequently printed on the slide. The purified protein microarray was originally used to build the yeast proteome microarray containing 5800 ORFs, and has since been employed in various protein function and antibody biomarker discovery studies 12. Currently, the most comprehensive purified protein array is the HuProt\u2122 human proteome microarray v2.0 manufactured by Arrayit Corporation and CDI Laboratories. The array has 19 394 proteins with 15 275 different genes, covering \u223c75% of the human genome and representing different splicing isoforms. However, there are some disadvantages to the purified protein microarray approach; these include: (i) the expense and time requirement for the expression and purification of thousands of proteins, (ii) the challenge of expressing and purifying large proteins (>50 kDa) and membrane proteins, (iii) the short shelf life 25, and (iv) the possibility of incorrect protein folding and activity if the proteins are expressed in a different host milieu (e.g. human proteins expressed in E. coli) or dried following array production.",

The proteins can be printed as a complete lysate, fractionated using multidimensional liquid\u2010based separation techniques, or captured to the array surface with specific antibodies. The translational applications differ depending on the fractionation state of the lysate and how the proteins are captured to slide. NPMs with fractionated samples are often probed with serum, and have been used to study the immune response to various cancers and their altered antigens (i.e. phosphorylated and glycosylated proteins) 26. The antibody target must then be subsequently identified, which is often done with mass spectrometry. Sample fractionation can also assist in the analyses of specific protein classes, for example, membrane or glycosylated proteins 26.",

Therefore, cell\u2010free protein microarrays use PCR\u2010generated DNA fragments or plasmid cDNA to express proteins in a cell\u2010free expression system that transcribes and translates the genes\u2010of\u2010interest 28. Various expression systems are commercially available, including lysate from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, rabbit reticulocyte, and human cells. Cell\u2010free protein microarrays include the protein in situ array 29, DNA array to protein array 30, nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) 13, 31, 32, in situ puromycin\u2010capture array 33, and the \u201cunpurified\u201d protein array developed by Davies et al. 34. Following in vitro transcription and translation that typically require 2\u20135 h, the expressed proteins are captured in situ by a capture antibody or molecule. The \u201cunpurified\u201d cell\u2010free microarray does not use any capturing agent; instead, the lysate containing the expressed protein\u2010of\u2010interest is spotted directly onto a nitrocellulose substrate, with the assumption that the coprinted lysate will have a similar background from feature to feature. Unpurified cell\u2010free protein microarrays have been successfully applied in immune profiling and antibody biomarker discovery for infectious diseases 9, 34, 35, 36, 37. In addition to the aforementioned applications, NAPPA has also been used to study protein\u2013protein interactions and PTMs 13, 19, 38, 39.",

The cell lysate, which includes chaperone proteins, also allows the proteins\u2010of\u2010interest to be expressed, folded, and maintained in physiologically compatible buffers from the time of translation through the experiment, thus significantly reducing the likelihood of unfolding, denaturing, or drying. Cell\u2010free expression arrays are cost\u2010effective because they do not require protein purification, and the printing of DNA (i.e. DNA array to protein array, NAPPA) results in a more stable array with a longer shelf life than protein\u2010based microarrays. These arrays can be easily made high throughput, with thousands of different proteins displayed on a standard\u2010sized microscope slide (i.e. 75 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 1.2 mm3). For example, NAPPA uses a routine density of \u223c2300 proteins per slide, which has been increased to 8000 with the use of nanowells 40, 41. Finally, immune responses in disease may recognize both linear and conformation epitopes. Thus, biomarker screening using proteins that are both folded and denatured is likely to have the value of displaying both types of epitopes. NAPPA is amenable to studying both folded and denatured proteins, making it possible to identify autoantibody biomarkers to epitopes that would otherwise be buried during healthy homeostasis 42, 43, 44.",

For the other types of cell\u2010free microarrays, nonspecific binding of components in the cell\u2010free expression system to the array matrix may occur; however, these nonspecific interactions are largely removed during several washing steps, leaving behind lysate components that are at a level much lower than that of the protein\u2010of\u2010interest and are consistent across features. A bigger theoretical concern is that lysate proteins, which are also human, may interact specifically with some captured proteins\u2010of\u2010interest and be displayed as protein complexes. Therefore, all findings should be confirmed with subsequent studies. It is also worth noting that some degree of known PTM can occur to the protein\u2010of\u2010interest when expressed in some cell lysates, most notably phosphorylation with the human cell\u2010free expression system 45.",

However, bead\u2010based arrays offer an alternative approach, and have been frequently used in biomarker validation and the development of IVD tests. They are particularly useful when the number of proteins\u2010of\u2010interest is modest and the number of clinical specimens is high (Fig. 2) 14, 46; however, more recent advances in this approach are enabling the analyses of greater numbers of proteins 47. In bead\u2010based microarrays, the address of the target protein is embedded in the colors of their specifically bound beads. With Luminex xMAP\u00ae technology, each bead is barcoded using two fluorescent dyes that are mixed in an appropriate ratio; up to 500 different color beads are available. More colored beads (n = 1725) with a combination of four fluorescent dyes have also been developed for higher throughput analyses 47. As an example, antigens\u2010of\u2010interest on different color\u2010coated beads are incubated with serological samples. Captured antibodies from the serological samples are then bound by a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Two readings will take place during analyses: (i) the bead color will identify its associated antigen and (ii) the fluorescence from the secondary antibody will indicate the abundance of serological antibodies specifically bound to the antigen. The merits of the bead\u2010based assay include high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, excellent reproducibility, and ease of automation. Moreover, some bead\u2010based assays have been approved for clinical use, including the LIFECODES\u00ae LifeScreen Deluxe, an HLA antibody assay, (Immucor GTI Diagnostics, Inc.) 48 and BioPlex\u00ae 2200 HIV Ag\u2010Ab (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories) 49.

Since 30 to 40% of children diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma will not respond to the standard chemotherapy treatment, Petricoin et al. 54 applied RPPAs to map the phosphoproteomic network within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with the objective of identifying better treatment options for nonresponders. Lysed microdissected tumor cells from 59 patients were printed directly onto a planar surface and then probed with antibodies specific to 16 proteins and 17 phosphoproteins in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Higher levels of phosphorylated proteins that reflect PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation were significantly associated with poor overall and disease\u2010free survival of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. Further, mTOR inhibitors (i.e. rapamycin analogues) were able to profoundly reduce tumor growth in mouse xenografts, which suggests that administration of mTOR inhibitors to patients with high mTOR pathway activation may result in a more favorable chemotherapy response with improved cancer prognosis.

Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disorder affecting the CNS, causing symptoms that include fatigue, dizziness, pain, spasticity, depression, cognitive impairment, and bladder/bowel problems. As reported in 2008, 2\u20132.5 million people worldwide have multiple sclerosis 57. The development of new biomarkers would be helpful in diagnosing and predicting the onset of multiple sclerosis. To address this need, Ayoglu et al. 7 screened the sera of 90 multiple sclerosis patients using a purified protein microarray containing 11 520 protein fragments (\u223c7500 unique proteins) generated by the Human Protein Atlas project. Among the 2000 reactive autoantibodies that were initially identified, 384 priority targets were further verified in a large sample cohort (n = 376) using a bead\u2010based assay. Fifty one autoantibodies showed differential responses to eight subtypes of multiple sclerosis. This work demonstrates the value of protein microarrays in finding potential multiple sclerosis biomarkers and supports validating these biomarkers in a larger population. It also highlights the complementing roles of planar and bead\u2010based protein arrays in the proteomic biomarker discovery and validation pipeline (Fig. 2).",

In the United States alone, over 1 million people are living with T1D, resulting in $14.9 billion of associated healthcare costs per year (CDC Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014; Economic Cost of Diabetes in the United States in 2012). Therefore, it is clear that biomarkers for the early prediction and diagnosis of T1D are urgently needed. Miersch et al. 59 performed a proteome\u2010wide screen for T1D serological autoantibody biomarkers using NAPPA protein microarrays containing \u223c6000 human proteins. Ten potential autoantibody biomarkers identified in cohort 1 (50 cases and 20 controls) were validated in cohort 2 (75 cases and 74 controls) and cohort 3 (46 cases and 46 controls). Among them, the autoantibody to dual\u2010specificity tyrosine phosphorylation\u2010regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) was further validated using the Luciferase Immuno Precipitation System assay with a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 98%. The combination of DYRK2A with the known T1D antigen, IA\u20102A, generated a higher AUC of 0.90, compared to AUCs of 0.72 and 0.64 for DYRK2A and IA\u20102A alone, respectively. As a recent follow\u2010up to better understand the environmental triggers of T1D, Bian et al. 18, 41 fabricated a viral proteome microarray containing 761 viral proteins from 25 different viruses using NAPPA technology and then analyzed the antibody responses of 42 patients with T1D and 42 age\u2010gender matched patients without T1D. This approach appeared to provide a reliable measure of historical infection because the antiviral antibody response to common viruses correlated well with known viral infection rates from epidemiological studies. Interestingly, the viral infection that was closely associated with T1D (OR 6.6; 95% CI: 2.0\u201325.7) was the Epstein\u2013Barr virus, particularly in younger patients. This study demonstrates the potential value of immunoproteomics in better understanding the role of viral infections in chronic disease 18.",
