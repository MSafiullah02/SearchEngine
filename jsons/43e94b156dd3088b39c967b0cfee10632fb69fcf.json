Objectives: To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. Study design: Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). Results: Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years ( \u00b1 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2-14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients Conclusions: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.",

Two epidemiological studies [6, 7] of familial aggregation cases infected with SARS-CoV showed that the spread of SARS-CoV does not occur during the incubation period, but rather in the diseased period, mostly in the population with a history of living together or having close contact with confirmed patients. Meanwhile, retrospective studies [5] from various provinces and cities found very strong transmissibility in the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, which is in line with the results our study. Here, only case C and A had been living together; the rest were all exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients through dinner parties or via transportation, which also proved the strong infectivity and communicability of this virus during the incubation period.",

One study [4] on 41 patients from the early stage of this epidemic outbreak (until January 2) found that 63% patients had lymphocytopenia, whereas all had pneumonia. Zhao [9] et al analyzed the clinical characteristics of 28 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (from diagnosis date up to February 5) and found the ordinary starting symptoms to be fever and cough (mainly dry cough) as well, in addition to other symptoms like chill, throat irritation, and fatigue. Radiographic tests showed that the lesions occurred in each part of the bilateral lungs; chest CT showed ground-glass shadow, edge fuzzy shadow, and spot or patchy shadow. The aforementioned results were consistent with the clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and chest images of the cluster cases in our district. Further, an analysis [10] of 4021 confirmed patients in China suggested that the proportion of mild, severe, and ordinary patients is 4.5%, 25.5%, and 69.9%, respectively. The same trend could be seen among the 10 patients in our district. It is possible that the majority of patients with COVID-19 are ordinary-type cases [11] .",

            "text": "One patient was characterized by diarrhea, with no fever or respiratory symptom, and another case had nausea caused by SARS-CoV-2 involvement in the. gastrointestinal tract, which was observed. with other coronavirus infections such as SARS in 2003. Cheng [12] reported that 10.6% (15/142) of patients with SARS present with symptoms of diarrhea at admission, whereas this occurs in 48.6% (69/142) of patients within 7.6 \u00b1 2.6 days after this; the mechanism might be related to viral replication in the gut. Additionally, one study [13] on 298 young children with febrile urinary tract infection revealed NLR as a practical biomarker capable of predicting acute pyelonephritis; there is also an important association between NLR and bacterial infection such as pneumonia, sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response. Increased NLR outperforms conventional markers, such as WBCs, neutrophil counts, and CRP, as a useful biomarker to detect bacteremia. In this study, the NLR in severe cases was significantly higher than that in ordinary-type cases, indicating that NLR might be related to the severity of COVID-19. NLR is a simple, cheap, and easy parameter of inflammation, because it can be measured in almost all laboratories. This indicator can be used for routine analysis to further explore the role of NLR in predicting the severity of COVID-19. Notably, it can be seen that CRP increased in most patients here, but PCT values were normal for all [14, 15] showed that PCT is normal during virus infection and that the specificity of predicting bacterial infection is higher than that of CRP. Therefore, the routine use of antibacterials is not recommended for COVID-19 patients in the absence of PCT elevation. As is well known, viral infection is closely related to the human immune system [16, 17] ; good immune function can help the body to eliminate foreign microorganisms, control infection, and eventually restore health. Wang [17] analyzed the correlation between changes in lymphocytes in 252 SARS cases and the disease itself and reported that CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells are significantly diminished in the first week of the disease. The patients' conditions improved as CD4 T lymphocytes became normal; in contrast, it indicates the deterioration of diseases related to cellular immunity damage. Recently, Guo et al [18] analyzed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia and found that the absolute counts of CD3 + T cells, CD3+CD4 + T cells, and CD3+CD8+T cells in the group that died was significantly lower than those in the surviving group, indicating the impairment of cellular immunity as well. In the severe-type in our study, the CD4 count for Case A was 61 cells/uL, for Case G was 180 cells/uL, and for Case I was 348 cells/uL, whereas the CD4 counts were all above 399 cells/uL for other patients, with both ordinary-and mild-types, suggesting decreased cellular immunity at the onset of disease in severe patients.",
