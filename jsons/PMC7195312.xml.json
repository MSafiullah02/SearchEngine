After he observed seven suspicious cases of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like symptoms, he sounded the alarm of a possible epidemic of a new virus, but was accused of making false alerts that disturbed the public order [1]. It is not clear who else recognized the accumulating cases with suspicious symptoms and it is likely that other specialists besides the ophthalmologist realized the start of an infectious disease outbreak. By now, the whole world knows about the highly contagious virus SARS-CoV-2 which has rapidly emerged as a global health threat.",

This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can cause an inflammation of conjunctiva that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye, causing redness and itchiness in the eye. However, correlations between conjunctivitis and COVID-19 could also be confounded by co-correlation with unobserved factors. The pathomechanistic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and conjunctivitis is not clear yet either. Nevertheless, further studies highlighted the importance of recognizing possible early ocular manifestations and suggested to stay highly vigilant to recognize the early manifestation of COVID-19 including consideration of viral conjunctivitis as a possible presentation [4]. We suspect that the conjunctivitis cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are underestimated for several reasons: (i) not necessarily all patients with conjunctivitis but without typical COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, respiratory symptoms) will be clinically evaluated. Though irritating, conjunctivitis rarely affects vision and many will opt for self-treatment of symptoms. We also have to take into account that often patients with symptoms of conjunctivitis associated with mild systemic symptoms (mild fever or cough) take measures to quarantine and will never be medically evaluated. (ii) To date, we have no data regarding how many patients with conjunctivitis (who did or did not attend the eye emergency department) developed COVID-19 in the following days. (iii) During the COVID-19 epidemic, ophthalmologists may have to deal with patients affected by conjunctivitis of other nature and have no guidelines on how to make a differential diagnosis.",

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival sac of affected patients is also reported by a non-peer-reviewed retrospective cohort study [7]. Anecdotal reports further suggested that when no eye protection was worn, the virus could also possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva and cause infectionii [7]. However, the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by conjunctiva is controversial. Nevertheless, the WHO and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)iii recommend wearing eye protection (e.g., goggles or shield) when treating patients (potentially) infected with COVID-19 to prevent droplet transmission.",
