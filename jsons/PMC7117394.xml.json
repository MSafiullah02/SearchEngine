A new method called PRC was developed to identify the direct-binding site of MS2 CP on the ribozyme RNA. Interestingly, all the RNA sequences bound by MS2 CP were located in the P5ab\u2013P5 structure (Fig. 3\nA). The shortest sequence was mapped to 135A to 151C, while the longest one was from sites 131A to 200C of the ribozyme RNA. It is particularly interesting to notice that the unpaired A139\u2013A140 in J5/5a was protected from RNase A cleavage in all six clones. Because RNase A specifically cleaves the single-stranded RNA, the exclusive protection of J5/5a and P5ab harboring a number of unpaired nucleotides readily suggests that MS2 primarily binds to J5/5a\u2013P5ab structure and protects it from RNase A digestion.",

Strikingly, G286/287 in the J8/7 junction, G256/G257 in the P3 helix, and G245\u2013247 in the P7 helix became strongly resistant to T1 cleavage in the presence of MS2 CP (Fig. 4A).

The cross-link signals at C135\u2013G138 of the base-paired region of P5 might not be attributable to a direct binding by MS2 CP; they may instead reflect an increased tertiary interaction with L9, because the GAAAA sequence in L9 also displayed strong cross-link signals (Fig. 4B and C). The L9 GNRA tetraloop are expected to interact with the minor groove of P5 [8], [22] and this tertiary interaction is subjected to cross-linking by UV irradiation [20], [21]. The increase of L9/P5 tertiary interaction by MS2 CP binding is further supported by T1 footprinting data showing a moderate protection at region around G308 (Fig. 4A and B).",

To circumvent this problem, direct hydroxyl-radical cleavage assay has been used to map the protein-binding sites on some group I introns [24], in which series of protein mutants containing a single cysteine at different positions needed to be constructed, expressed, and purified. In this study, the protein-protected RNA cloning (PRC) method has been developed to successfully identify the MS2-binding site on the Candida group I ribozyme RNA. In principle, the RNA bound by MS2 CP is protected from nuclease digestion and can be successfully cloned after RT-PCR amplification. This method is cost-effective and easy to be performed, which provides an attractive alternative to identify RNA sequences bound by RNA-binding proteins in vitro.",

MS2 interacts with the cognate RNA hairpin asymmetrically. The adenine at the \u22124 position in the terminal loop and the bulged purine at \u221210 in the paired region establish four and three hydrogen bonds with some threonine and serine residues in the MS2 protein (Fig. 3D) [26]. In the Candida P5ab structure, two symmetrically bulged Gs are present in P5a, and one recovered sequence contains only G141\u2013C152 in P5a, indicating that this side of P5a may directly contact MS2 protein and that G144 might represent the \u221210 purine, resembling the base-paired structure in the F6 aptamer (Fig. 3B). We also noted that P5a could form an alternative structure, with one bulged G144 pairing with U185 and the other bulged G184 pairing with U145. This alternative pairing ending up with a single bulged A143 after the first two base pairs in P5a represents a conserved paired structure for the MS2 protein targets (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, previous research has shown that A-4 is essential for MS2 recognition, and base substitution at this position reduces the dissociation constant of the protein binding to 670 nM [13], consistent with the lack of a conserved A(-4) in the P5ab\u2013P5 structure and a similar low binding affinity.",

And La, hnRNP K, and hnRNP I are reported to possess RNA chaperone activity [4]. This study shows that MS2 CP, a bacteriophage protein, can bind to a peripheral structure of a group I ribozyme, which in turn stabilizes the core structure and promotes the activity of the ribozyme. The action mechanism of this protein is strikingly similar to that of the CYT-18 protein on its cognate and non-cognate group I ribozymes.
