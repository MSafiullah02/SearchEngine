Stock prices are commonly known to react to economic news. A vast amount of research has focused on the impact of macroeconomic variables on stock returns (Fama, 1981; Chen et al. 1986; Fama and French, 1988; Wasserfallen, 1989; Asprem, 1989; Bulmash and Trivoli, 1991; Abdullah and Hayworth, 1993). However, studies regarding the exploratory power of non-macroeconomic variables in predicting stock returns are rare and a recent trend. Chen et al. (1986) asserted that stock prices are affected by a variety of national and international events and some, such as political and sports events, have an even more dramatic impact on stock prices than others do.",

In general, international tourist hotels are much more upscale than general tourist hotels and general hotels, providing high-quality service. The first hotel company that made an appearance in the Taiwan stock market was Hotel Holiday Garden (international tourist hotel) in the year 1965. Since then, more numbers of hotel companies have been publicly held and their stocks have been traded in the market.",

(1986), three macroeconomic variables, interest rates, inflation, and industrial production, should be systematic predictors of stock market returns. Wasserfallen (1989) investigated the effects of macroeconomic variables on stock price indices for the UK, Germany, and Switzerland. Evidence was found that stock returns were positively related to real activity. A higher economic activity increases the expected profits of firms, thereby boosting stock price movements positively. Gross national product, industrial production, real consumption, real investment, the unemployment rate, and real wages are widely used to measure economic activity. On the other hand, inflation was inversely related to stock returns. Consumer price index and nominal wage index are generally used to measure inflation. The negative effect of interest rates on stock returns was expected and his regression result confirmed the inverse relationship. Although he found the significant effects of inflation and interest rates on stock returns, the overall explanatory power of these macroeconomic variables in the model was small.",

Real economic activity (industrial production and exports), money, and the US yield curve were positively correlated to stock prices, whereas employment, imports, inflation, and interest rates had a negative relationship with changes in stock prices. The relationships between stock returns and real activity, inflation, and the money supply are well documented by Fama (1981). He asserted that a negative association between stock returns and inflation and a positive association between stocks and real activity are natural consequences of an inverse relationship between inflation and real economic activity. He added that an increase in real activity, which drives stock returns, stimulates the demand for money through the simple quantity theory model; this creates a positive relationship between money supply and stock returns.",

They found that interest rates influenced stock prices negatively because higher interest rates attracted another investment option, causing stock prices to decrease.

Five macroeconomic variables were hypothesized to have relationships with stock returns: expected inflation rate, money supply, domestic consumption, term structure of the interest rate, and industrial production. Three of the five variables were significant: inflation, money supply, and domestic consumption. Stock returns had a negative relationship with inflation rate, but a positive relationship with money supply and domestic consumption.",

Originated from the expansionary monetary policy, which is designed to stimulate the economy, an increase in money growth (\u0394M2) causes an unexpected boost in the public's cash balance, which results in the wealth effect. The wealth effect tends to stimulate consumption and production and increase investment. A significant share of increased wealth would shift to stocks and bonds and increase investment in securities, thereby resulting in higher securities prices. An increase in the money supply would also reduce interest rates and encourage investment, consumption, and production. The result of this study regarding the positive effect of increase in the money supply is consistent with the findings of Bulmash and Trivoli (1991) and Barrows and Naka (1994). The hotel stocks in the Taiwan stock market did not behave much differently from its counterpart in the United States (Barrows and Naka, 1994).",

Tourism organizations and marketers in Taiwan should put heads together to take advantage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics in China.

The Asian financial crisis had a minimum negative impact on the Taiwan hotel stock returns compared to other non-macroeconomic variables (see Table 5). Our speculation is Taiwan was not one of the major Asian countries that initiated and seriously experienced the financial crisis. Goldstein (1998) pointed out that the overall economy and the stock market in Taiwan were least hit by the financial crisis among five Asian countries, including Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan. Secondly, although the economic downturn discourages public travel in general, business travelers would still travel around within a limited budget and some of the leisure travelers could take it as an opportunity to travel domestically or internationally at a lower price. The above grounds may explain the reason why the negative effect of the Asian financial crisis was relatively weaker than other factors.",
