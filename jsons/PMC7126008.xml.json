            "text": "Lassa virus belongs to the family Arenaviridae and is the etiologic agent of Lassa fever in humans. Transmission of the virus from its natural host \u2013 the African rodent Mastomys natalensis \u2013 to humans causes a systemic disease with bleeding and organ failure. Lassa fever is endemic in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. A variety of compounds have shown antiviral activity against arenaviruses in cell culture (Huggins et al., 1984, Rodriguez et al., 1986, Burns et al., 1988; Andrei and De Clercq, 1990, Andrei and De Clercq, 1993; De Clercq et al., 1991, Nair and Ussery, 1992, Smee et al., 1992, Candurra et al., 1996, Garcia et al., 2000, Wachsman et al., 2000, Bartolotta et al., 2001). The only drug with a proven therapeutic effect in humans with Lassa fever is the broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue ribavirin (McCormick et al., 1986), which inhibits replication of related arenaviruses in cell culture (Huggins et al., 1984, Rodriguez et al., 1986, Andrei and De Clercq, 1990) and has beneficial effects in experimental animal models of Lassa fever (Stephen and Jahrling, 1979, Jahrling et al., 1980, Dvoretskaia et al., 1991). However, the drug is effective only if administered early after infection (McCormick et al., 1986). Several cases of Lassa fever recently imported into Europe have demonstrated that even state-of-the-art intensive care cannot prevent a fatal outcome if ribavirin treatment is initiated too late (Schmitz et al., 2002). This report describes assays for testing potential antiviral compounds against Lassa virus and other highly pathogenic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003) and Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus (Feldmann et al., 2003). The test combines classical cell culture with real-time PCR. A class of imidazole nucleoside/nucleotide analogues was identified which showed inhibitory activity against Lassa virus and, to a lesser extent, against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus.",

Twenty-four hours later, the cells were infected in the biosafety level 4 laboratory with Lassa virus strain AV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01, or Ebola virus subtype Zaire at an MOI of 0.1 in 100 \u03bcl. The inoculum was removed after 1 h and replaced by fresh medium complemented with different concentrations of compound. None of the three viruses showed cytopathic effect under our culture conditions. Virus RNA concentration in supernatant was measured by real-time PCR during the exponential growth phase of the viruses (Fig. 1B), i.e. after 2 days for Lassa virus and SARS-CoV, and after 3 days for Ebola virus. During this time, the viruses were growing by several orders of magnitudes if no inhibitor was added. For RNA preparation, a simple and inexpensive method (Boom et al., 1990) was adopted. A 140-\u03bcl aliquot of supernatant was mixed with 560 \u03bcl chaotropic lysis buffer AVL (Qiagen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The lysate was added to 100 mg diatomaceous silica (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) suspended in 560 \u03bcl ethanol and incubated with agitation for 30 min at room temperature. The diatomaceous silica were pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet was washed with 500 \u03bcl AW1 buffer (Qiagen), subsequently with 500 \u03bcl AW2 buffer (Qiagen), and finally with 400 \u03bcl acetone. The pellet was dried at 56 \u00b0C and the RNA eluted with 100 \u03bcl water. Quantitative real-time PCR assays for Lassa virus, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus Zaire were performed with the purified RNA based on previously published protocols (Gibb et al., 2001, Drosten et al., 2003, Asper et al., 2004). The detailed reaction conditions are given in Table 1\n. In vitro transcripts of the PCR target regions were amplified in the PCR to generate standard curves for quantification of the virus RNA in supernatant.",

In agreement with published data on related arenaviruses (Huggins et al., 1984, Rodriguez et al., 1986, Andrei and De Clercq, 1990), ribavirin inhibited Lassa virus replication with an IC50 of 9 \u03bcg/ml and an IC90 of 14 \u03bcg/ml. Furthermore, the inhibition kinetics measured with real-time PCR perfectly corresponded to the kinetics measured with the immunofocus assay (Fig. 1C), indicating that real-time PCR can be used to measure the effect of compounds on Lassa virus replication. About 100 nucleoside analogues of different chemical classes available at the Institute were tested using this assay. For screening, three different concentrations in the range between 10 and 50 \u03bcg/ml were tested. A class of imidazole nucleoside/nucleotide analogues was identified that showed inhibitory effects on Lassa virus without severely affecting cell growth and viability. Eighteen compounds of this class were tested (Fig. 2\nand Table 2\n). Particularly active compounds (3, 8, 23, 24, 34, 35, 56, and 64) were analysed in detail using real-time PCR and immunofocus assay as a read-out (Fig. 3A\n). Each of these compounds showed a similar effect on Lassa virus RNA and infectious particles, again demonstrating the validity of the PCR-based assay. IC50 values as determined with the RNA concentration data ranged from 5 to 21 \u03bcg/ml and IC90 values ranged from 27 to 58 \u03bcg/ml (Table 2). In the 48-h assay, compounds 8, 23, 24, 35, and 56 showed no significant influence on the rapidly growing Vero cells in concentrations up to 100 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 3A). In order to test whether this class of nucleoside analogues shows broad-spectrum activity, the complete set of 18 compounds was also tested against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus (Table 2). Virus-specific effects were observed with the less toxic compounds 8, 10, 13, 23, 24, and 35 (Fig. 3B and C). However, the inhibiting effects against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus were considerably lower than observed for Lassa virus and overlapped with cell toxicity at higher concentrations. There was no evidence for a SARS-CoV- or Ebola virus-specific effect with compound 3 due to its toxicity.",

A number of nucleoside analogues containing 5-membered heterocyclic rings, such as imidazole, pyrazole, and triazole, have since long been documented as potent antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumor agents (De Clercq and Luczak, 1975, Srivastava et al., 1976, Korbukh et al., 1978, Smith and Kirkpatrick, 1980, Revankar et al., 1981). These include, but are not limited to, bredinin (Gerber et al., 1998), a potent nucleoside antibiotic containing an imidazole ring, and ribavirin (Sidwell et al., 1972, Witkowski et al., 1972, Smith and Kirkpatrick, 1980, Tam et al., 2001, Crotty et al., 2002, Lau et al., 2002), a broad-spectrum antiviral agent containing a triazole nucleus. In addition to possessing a 5-membered heterocyclic ring, the target compounds also contain acyclic sugar or sugar phosphonate groups attached to the heterocyclic ring, and thus mimic part or whole of the natural sugar or sugar phosphate of nucleosides and nucleotides. In this context, they are analogues of the widely known potent, broad-spectrum antivirals, namely acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine] (Schaeffer et al., 1978, Kaplan and Bain, 1999, Emmert, 2000, De Clercq et al., 2001) and PMEA/PMEG [9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine/guanine] (Balzarini et al., 1997, Naesens and De Clercq, 1997, Naesens et al., 1997, Kramata et al., 1998, Compton et al., 1999, Noble and Goa, 1999). The observation that SARS-CoV and Ebola virus were also inhibited to a certain extent suggests that this class of analogues potentially has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The mode of action is completely speculative and may be different depending on the chemical characteristics of a given compound. One possibility is direct inhibition of the virus replication machinery. Alternatively, the analogues might affect cellular pathways of nucleotide metabolism. The RNA synthesis of a highly replicating virus like Lassa virus probably is more susceptible to inhibition of nucleotide metabolism than the corresponding cellular processes. Inhibition of nucleotide metabolism could also account for the toxicity associated with some of the compounds.",
