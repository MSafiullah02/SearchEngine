The nature of the interaction may vary depending on the structures and medium conditions. Even being non\u2010covalent, the strength is enough for allowing its determination based on the proportionality between biopolymer and ligand molecules. Electroactive molecules have been widely used as indicators in the analysis of these biopolymers. Commonly, the molecule remains electroactive after interaction. Then, separation between the free ligand and the complex ligand\u2013biopolymer is necessary. This is the reason why this methodology has been specially developed in the field of biosensing with heterogeneous assays 1. Once the interaction took place, washing or medium exchange allows measurement of the bound fraction. Other possibility is the use of a separation technique, such as CE. Microchips are ideal for a fast separation between both fractions. Differences in charge/radius ratio are usually notorious between the free ligand and the biomolecule.",

Thus, MCE\u2010ED was applied to ssDNA detection for the first time using this electroactive dye based on the electrostatic interaction between cationic MB and anionic ssDNA obtaining reproducible calibration curves. The next step, that is the goal of this work, is the study of the interaction between MB and dsDNA. As in the case of ssDNA, bibliography related to the use of indicators with the aim of detecting DNA in MCE, especially with ED is scarce.

Final fixation with epoxy resin (Araldit) and adhesive tape is made. In this way, only the gold disk in front of the outlet of the channel is in contact with the solution meanwhile the rest of the gold wire, since it is covered with the epoxy resin and adhesive tape, is not in contact with the solution decreasing the capacitive current and noise.",

A microchip made of Topas, a polymeric material with promising characteristics, was employed. Easy integration of ED is made through the inclusion of a gold wire (100 \u03bcm diameter) at the end of the separation channel 26. Among several indicators checked, MB was chosen because it presents a well\u2010defined reversible redox process with a potential of \u22120.171 V versus Ag/AgCl in TBE (50 mM Tris\u2010boric acid pH=7.0, 1 mM EDTA). The amperometric detection of MB implies a cathodic process. Thus, after performing the corresponding hydrodynamic voltammogram, an optimal potential of \u22120.3 V has been chosen. The solution is introduced in the sample reservoir and an unpinched injection at +1500 V for 5 s and a separation at +2000 V are performed for recording electropherograms. When MB interacts with ssDNA in solution and the mixture is injected in a MCE\u2010ED device, two different signals are obtained, one for free MB and other (less reproducible) for the complex MB\u2010ssDNA, around 35 and 90 s respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 2B. Determination of ssDNA is based on the decrease of the free MB signal (Fig. 2A). Interaction is now checked with dsDNA through hybridization assays. A 30\u2010mer single strand (ssDNA, with a sequence that is specific from the SARS virus) reacts with the complementary one (cDNA) producing a double strand. Two different methodologies for the hybridization were checked. In the first case (Fig. 3A) both strands are mixed together with the electroactive intercalator. The mixture is performed off\u2010chip in an Eppendorf tube by adding the single strands on an MB solution. After mixing, the solution is deposited on the sample reservoir for performing successive injections in the separation channel. Electropherograms are recorded with time in order to follow hybridization and MB interactions at real time. In the second methodology (Fig. 3B) time is given for previous hybridization (15\u201330 min) and then the solution is added to a MB solution. The final mixture is deposited on the sample reservoir for recording the electropherogram corresponding to the MB interaction. ",

In all the cases two peaks were obtained in the electropherograms, one corresponding to free MB (approximately at a migration time of 35 s) and other that stands for the complex MB\u2010DNA (at around 90s).

A decrease for MB\u2010ssDNA and MB\u2010cDNA of a 16 and 24%, respectively, is obtained. The higher value obtained after adding cDNA is attributed to the higher number of guanines (6 instead of the 4 that are present in ssDNA). It has been reported that MB interacts preferently with guanines from single strands of DNA 28. Therefore, the higher the number of this base, the higher the amount of MB that associates with strands of DNA and in turn, the higher the decrease in the signal of free MB. In the case of the hybridization between single strands (5 ng/\u03bcL ssDNA and 5 ng/\u03bcL cDNA), the decrease is slightly higher, indicating that more MB is involved. It seems that there is no difference between both modes of hybridization methodology (29.6 and 28.6% when hybridization occurs before or simultaneously to MB interaction, respectively). After injecting a DNA solution (ssDNA, cDNA or dsDNA) MB was injected and the signal increases again. The relative standard deviation between MB signals recorded after DNA injections is 4.9%. ",

An expression vector involved in the transitory or stable expression in mammals cells, pFLAG\u2010CMV4, is employed as a model. A 50 \u03bcM solution of MB is situated in the injection reservoir, and after applying the injection voltage and introduced in the separation channel, the corresponding electropherogram is recorded. Then, a 5 ng/\u03bcL of dsDNA is added and let to react. The ligand\u2010biomolecule occurs then off\u2010channel by adding DNA to the dye. This mixing order, employed before, was determined to affect the distribution of dye molecules on DNA fragments 29. Moreover, in this way, a signal of MB before interaction with dsDNA can be obtained. The resulting mixture of dsDNA, MB and dsDNA\u2013MB complex was injected on the separation channel at different times until 120 min. Similar to what happens for a ssDNA, there is a slight decrease in the signal for free MB and a second signal, supposedly caused by the complex MB\u2010dsDNA appears. However, clear differences between ssDNA and dsDNA can be observed in Fig. 5 where electropherograms recorded for interactions at different times (up to 120 min) are shown. In Fig. 5A(MB\u2010ssDNA) it can be seen that there is not an observable change in the migration time with time, for either the first or the second signal. The current of the first peak maintains similar and can decrease slightly for the second. However, in the case of MB\u2013dsDNA (Fig. 5B), the second signal increases with time and there is a significant decrease on the migration time. The interaction of MB with ssDNA is supposedly electrostatic in nature and an interaction of the dye with guanine bases is reported as well 28. In the case of dsDNA, intercalation of the aromatic ring of MB between bases can occur apart from electrostatic\u2010binding. In fact, MB intercalation is employed in several applications, resulting better than ruthenium complexes 30. Therefore, in the variation of the process corresponding to MB\u2013dsDNA, two different phenomena can be observed. The first relating to a decrease in the migration time can be due to electrophoretic causes (charge/size ratio or channel modification). On the other hand, an odd shape appears with interaction time. This can be due to capacitive phenomena in the electrodic double layer. DNA can be adsorbed on the electrode surface, and MB can be adsorbed as well when DNA is present. In this way, the electrode area decreases. Thus, the capacitive current, that is proportional to this area, decreases too. This is more marked when MB\u2013dsDNA arrives to the electrode producing a positive peak. When reduction of MB associated with dsDNA occurs, a cleaning of the electrode occurs and the base line (and then the capacitive current) returns to its original value (Fig. 5B). ",

Similarly the peak current increases up to 90 min. Both effects are shown in the graphs of Fig. 6. However, both parameters remain constant for the first signal that corresponds to free MB. This can be indicative of a primary interaction between MB and DNA that stands for the decrease in the first signal and a reorganization with time for the complex MB\u2013dsDNA. ",

Hybridization between a single stranded 30\u2010mer sequence (ssDNA) corresponding to the SARS virus and the complementary (cDNA) is performed. Two different signals, one corresponding to free MB and the second for the complex MB\u2010DNA appears in the electropherograms. A decrease in the signal of free MB is always obtained after adding ssDNA and seems to be related to the number of guanines. Interaction with MB has been checked when it occurred simultaneously or after hybridization. No significant differences were found and then the interaction between MB and a dsDNA, pFLAG\u2010CMV4, was checked. In this case, the second signal increases with interaction time and there is a significant decrease on the migration time, which can be due to a reorganization of MB\u2013dsDNA complex. Work is in progress for sensitivity enhancement of the ED and achievement of the separation between ss and dsDNA. The integration of the hybridization reactions on microchip as well as real sample analysis is going to be also studied.",
