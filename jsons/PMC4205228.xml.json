For those weeks, the flood was their everyday life and became what they tweeted about most, whether about sandbagging efforts, shelter locations, or the needs of displaced families. As the situation subsided and water levels fell, residents returned to tweeting about other aspects of their lives and did not focus exclusively on the flood.5 This is the type of local reporting of the current situation that could provide essential situational awareness to emergency workers responding to the flooding. Listening to residents living within the impacted community can result in an understanding of the most urgent needs of the community, and an indication of when the community may be moving towards recovery after the immediate impact of a disaster.",

The first way is by following long-term trends to identify spikes in Twitter conversation that might indicate an emerging public health concern. This form of monitoring is primarily used for long term epidemiological surveillance of diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or H7N9 influenza, and requires the use of a Twitter analytics tool that can access historical Twitter data. The second way ASPR monitors Twitter, which is the focus of this article, is event-specific real-time monitoring. In contrast to the long term trend analysis which focuses on identifying deviations from the historical baseline, event-specific real-time monitoring focuses on finding reports on Twitter that provide situational awareness during an emergency response. The search techniques employed by ASPR for monitoring Twitter are meant to filter down to the most relevant information shared in the midst of a disaster. This article will outline the strategy ASPR employed for event-specific real-time Twitter monitoring during the HHS response to Superstorm Sandy in 2012.",

In addition, because the social media dashboard used by ASPR analysts searched for keywords within hashtags the use of #Sandy or other hashtags was not needed within any of the subject specific Boolean searches. These EEI searches were intentionally broad at the beginning of the monitoring process. Analysts would look for key issues within the results of each EEI search.

As such, every disaster is different and the same search techniques and strategies may not be applicable and relevant for every response. However, having a starting point of pre-established Boolean search strategies based on existing information needs and priorities, a process for verifying Twitter accounts immediately before and during response, and documenting changes made along the way are crucial to making Twitter work for augmenting situational awareness.",

            "text": "The most important lesson learned from Superstorm Sandy was the need for a dynamic and flexible monitoring process and strategy to understand and respond quickly to health needs in the areas impacted by Superstorm Sandy. Search strategies should change as frequently as the unfolding event. The inability to adapt to a changing situation ensures stale and stagnant terminology and search results. Twitter lists and Boolean searches should be used together to maximize situational awareness. The most important information comes from the impacted population, whether news, local government or local citizens. These are the people who care the most about the information being disseminated. The low number of geo-located tweets and inability to filter tweets based on location in many tools can present a problem in locating tweets from directly impacted areas. Therefore, the use of a targeted Twitter list can help to overcome this hurdle while simultaneously providing more trustworthy content. This information can often be used to guide what additional Boolean searches should be created to fish for individual tweets that provide additional details.",

An understanding of the impacted populations and communities will allow for the development of a more thoughtful and complete Twitter monitoring strategy. This includes taking into account the demographics of the impacted area, whether the area is urban or rural, and how active local government is on Twitter. Each of these will have a major impact on the amount and type of information that is available via Twitter throughout the course of the response.",

The strategy used accounted for known (i.e., EEI Boolean searches) and unknown informational needs (i.e., Twitter list). Yet, it is not enough to create a Twitter list and some Boolean searches at the beginning of an event and expect a consistent return of useful information. Twitter monitoring during an event involves constantly reacting to trends in the conversation and changing informational needs, and must remain fluid and flexible to prevent the retrieval of irrelevant information resulting from stagnating searches and lists. Investing in the technology, personnel, and training needed to effectively and efficiently monitor Twitter during a response has the potential to result in a high return on investment and inform on the needs of impacted communities.",
