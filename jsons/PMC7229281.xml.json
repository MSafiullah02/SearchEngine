By the 7th January, the 2019-novel Coronavirus had already been isolated by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. The WHO subsequently renamed the 2019-novel Coronavirus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease resulting from the referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

These spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domains in the SARS-CoV-2 virus appear to have a greater affinity to ACE-2 receptors than the SARS-CoV virus and given the high conservation of the S2 subunit, these receptor-binding domains have been identified as possible targets for antiviral compounds [12]. ACE2 receptors have higher expression in the lungs, heart, oesophagus, kidneys, bladder and ileum and thus these organs are considered more vulnerable to SARS-CoV2 infection [6].",

Isolated lymphopaenia has been noted in multiple studies with incidence ranging from 43 to 83% [14,20,21,45]. Elevations in acute phase reactants have been noted, with elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin [19,26], consistent with systemic inflammatory response. Other common biomarker derangements noted in the literature include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated liver enzymes (notably without derangements of liver synthetic function), and elevated D-dimer levels [[19], [20], [21],26]. These derangements have been studied for their utility as biomarker predictors of severity of COVID-19 infection. Evidence of correlation between severity and biomarker derangement has been demonstrated for lymphopaenia, CRP, LDH, liver enzymes, d-dimer, and ferritin [20,[27], [28], [29]]. Elevated d-dimer (>1000 ng/ml) was found to significantly predict in-hospital death, alongside age and SOFA score, with an odds ratio of 18.42 [30]. There is evidence that procalcitonin is commonly normal in patients and elevated levels may indicate secondary super-added bacterial infection, however the test is not widely available in the UK [31].",

Analysis of a large cross-sectional study suggests a sensitivity of RT-PCR of 66\u201380% with 23% of initial negative tests becoming positive following repeat with 67% of these having initial CT images consistent with COVID-19 [34]. Repeat testing has been found to improve sensitivity from 71% on initial testing to 94% on second swab taken 1\u20132 days later [35]. Typical CT changes in patients with initially negative RT-PCR swabs have been reported, suggesting importance of repeat samples in those with CT changes consistent with COVID infection [35,36].",

A cohort of patients with asymptomatic and mild infection had abnormal CT findings in 57% of cases [37]. There is a relative paucity in the literature of simple radiograph findings as compared to CT. A recent study aiming to address this demonstrated chest x-ray to have a sensitivity of 69% with bilateral, lower zone consolidation and ground glass opacities predominating [38]. This fits with the authors anecdotal experience (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). In a large cross-sectional study, CXR changes (patchy or ground glass opacities) were noted in 59% of patients with the same cohort having CT abnormalities in 86% [21]. Commonly noted CT features include bilateral or multi-lobar changes, peripheral distribution, ground glass or patchy opacities, and consolidation [21,25,39,40]. Septal thickening, linear opacities, and air bronchograms have been described, with lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and cavitations notably absent as features of COVID-19 [39,[41], [42], [43]]. CT changes have been linked to severity with progression of ground-glass opacities and presence of consolidation being associated with more severe infection (Fig. 3) [[44], [45], [46], [47]].",

ARDS lung protection ventilation guidelines are likely to minimise risk of ventilator-induced lung injury [52]. Prone positioning improves lung mechanics and has been shown to improve 90-day mortality in severe ARDS [53]. Fluid management and vasopressors are important in managing septic shock. Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is available at some centres and may be used as a last resort. A retrospective study of six COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO showed a mortality rate of 83.3% [50] Evidence suggests ECMO may be beneficial in severe ARDS [54].",
