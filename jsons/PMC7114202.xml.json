            "text": "Dengue virus (DEN) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae comprised of four distinct serotypes (DEN-1, 2, 3, 4) within the flavivirus genus. Infection with any of the four serotypes of dengue virus can result in an asymptomatic infection, a self-limited febrile disease (dengue fever, DF) or a severe, life-threatening illness (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) (Halstead, 1988). DEN infections are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world (Gubler, 1998, Gibbons and Vaughn, 2002). If untreated, the mortality rate of DHF is around 30% but can be reduced to 0.2\u20135% by fluid replacement.",

            "text": "Even though previous study suggested that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) take part in the pathogenesis of DHF, the pathogenesis of DHF cannot entirely be explained by antibody, however. Currently, many studies suggested that dengue-specific T-cell immune response are hypothesized to play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of DHF during a secondary DEN virus infection, and induction of immunopathology by T lymphocytes may occur by various mechanisms, including cell-mediated cytotoxicity and/or cytokine production (Miskovsky et al., 1994, Vergelli et al., 1997). In addition, other study showed that DHF is associated with high levels of T-cell cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and evidence of marked T-cell activation (Libraty et al., 2002). Recently, immunopathogenesis in DHF has been proposed. The evidence is that both dengue-specific CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes have been implicated in pathogenesis and natural immunity to dengue viruses (Rothman and Ennis, 1999, Lei et al., 2001). How T cells contribute to this process is incompletely defined, however, since only a few studies have directly examined T-cell responses during acute disease and few DEN-specific T-cell epitopes have been identified (Green et al., 1999, Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003). Therefore, the establishment of a library of defined T-cell epitopes from dengue viruses will help to explore the role of T cells in immunity and disease pathogenesis.",

A total of 1 \u00d7 105 PBMC were added in 100 \u03bcl RPMI-1640 medium per well, and individual peptides were subsequently added to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml. Unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 10 \u03bcg/ml) stimulated cells served as negative and positive controls, respectively. In addition, SARS-CoV peptide (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronary virus, SHVPLATSRTLA) used as irrelevant peptide control. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in air, plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Next, the biotinylated anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody was added. After an overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, plates were washed, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the diluted streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. After four final washes, plates were developed with 100 \u03bcl/well of alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium substrates (BCIP/NBT) Chromogen for 1 h at room temperature (protecting from light). Color development was monitored and stopped by washing with water. After dried overnight at room temperature, SFC (spots forming cells) per well were counted using an ELISPOT reader (Beijing SageCreation Science Co., Ltd., China).

We identified individual epitopes that producibly evoked IFN-\u03b3+ CD4+ T cells in the ICS assay that exceeded 0.01% (IFN-\u03b3+ cells less than or equal to 0.01% of CD4+ T cells were considered as negative). The positive response of PBMC showed that the percentages of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4+ T cells ranged from 0.03 to 0.27% (see Fig. 2\n) while the percentages of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells were 0 (data not shown). In addition, no responses to these peptides were seen in PBMC of the flavivirus-na\u00efve donor (data not shown). As a result, C45-57, E396-408, NS323-35 and NS3141-155 are DEN-specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes (see Fig. 2).",

However, these two methods have their shortcomings. The former is cumbersome and needs sophisticated equipments (such as mass spectrometer or peptide sequencer). The latter needs synthesis of a series of the overlapping peptides and massive experiments to identify which peptide is epitope, making it an extensive and time-consuming process (Drabner et al., 2002). At present, a novel strategies that utilize computer-based T-cell epitopes prediction methods combined with in vitro/in vivo studies was established to predict potential T-cell epitopes and are becoming increasingly popular as the amino acid sequences of pathogenic proteins are available in database (Huang et al., 2004, Turcanov\u00e1 and H\u00f6llsberg, 2004).",

Among epitopes-prediction programs, RANKpep prediction algorithm has higher sensitivity and specificity and represents a quick and effective way to identify T-cell epitopes (Drabner et al., 2002, Gomez-Nunez et al., 2006, Reche et al., 2002, Reche et al., 2004). Recently, ELISPOT assay and ICS assay were extensively used to measure the frequencies of memory T cells. Compared with other in vitro methods, ELISPOT assay and ICS assay own the higher sensitivity and the latter have the advantage of defining the phenotype of the cytokine secreting cells (Waldrop et al., 1997, Butz and Bevan, 1998, Pala et al., 2000). Therefore, the combination of ELISPOT assay and ICS assay is necessary to identify T-cell epitopes.",

            "text": "Up to date, studies identified some DEN-specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes, which are mainly located in NS3 protein or C protein (Kurane et al., 1995, Kurane et al., 1998, Gagnon et al., 1996, Mangada et al., 2004). However, most of these epitopes are only conserved in DEN-4 or DEN-3 or DEN-2, 3, 4 and the epitope which is highly conserved in DEN-1 had not been identified. Furthermore, the low sensitive methods/technologies (the limiting dilution method and cytotoxic assay) limited general laboratories to identify T-cell epitopes. In this study, we measured a higher frequencies of DEN peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3 responding CD4+ T cells by using ELISPOT assay and ICS assay and then identified four DEN-specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes. More importantly, among the 10 DF convalescent patients, as for each peptide, the breadth of the positive response ranged from 7 to 8 subjects. This suggested that these epitopes could be the immunodominant epitopes and restricted by the high-frequency HLA alleles of human population. Of course, future experiments would be performed to determine the HLA restriction of these epitopes. Among these four epitopes, C45-57 and NS3141-155 contains the sequence that was previously characterized as DEN-specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes (C47-55 and NS3146-154, respectively) (Kurane et al., 1995, Gagnon et al., 1996). Therefore, our results indicated that C47-55 and NS3146-154 could be the minimal sequence recognized by MHC-II molecule. Interestingly, NS3146-154 was previously identified as HLA-DR15-restricted epitope (Kurane et al., 1995) while the putative HLA allele of NS3141-155 by RANKpep is HLA-DR15. In addition, C47-55 was HLA-DPw4-restricted epitope (Gagnon et al., 1996) while the restricting HLA alleles of C45-57 by RANKpep include DPw4. Therefore, these information suggested that the restricting HLA alleles of C45-57 and NS3141-155 could be closely related with DPw4 and DR15, respectively. In this study, E396-408 and NS323-35 are two novel identified CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Since E protein is the important structural protein in DEN infection and immunity, more researchers aimed to identified T-cell epitopes located in this protein and defined some T-cell epitopes (Rothman et al., 1996, Simmons et al., 2005, Bashyam et al., 2006). However, to our knowledge, E396-408 is the first CD4+ T-cell epitopes identified in human population. Importantly, E396-408 is only highly conserved in DEN-1 strains. Therefore, the identification of E396-408 would help to explore the role of T-cell immune response induced by E protein in DEN infection or immunity. Previous study shown that NS3 protein appears to be the most immunogenic antigen for cellular responses to DEN and there exist many T-cell epitopes in NS3200-324 (Mathew et al., 1996). Consequently, most research focused on identifying T-cell epitopes located in this region (Kurane et al., 1995, Kurane et al., 1998). In this study, the identification of NS323-35 suggested that the other region of NS3 could also contribute to T-cell immune response.",
