Regionally, nationally, and internationally, leaders in SCI have been working collaboratively to address both immediate concerns, such as basic guidance on hand washing, to longer term planning for issues including access to consumable resources (gloves, catheters), caregiver shortages, and implications for discharge planning for inhospital patients with SCI. A rapid pulse survey to generate a global scan of providers on SCI-related issues and cases has been conducted, which will assist in providing information on the current and projected needs. In Canada, a community of SCI stakeholders including clinicians, researchers, and people with lived experience of SCI, rapidly crowdsourced an SCI-specific hand hygiene guide, and through international networks, have moved towards global access with multiple translations available. Globally, the move to incorporation of telehealth/telemedicine for patient care and consultation is an increasingly relevant and viable option, the positive effects of which we might realize long term post pandemic in improving patient access to services.",

Italy has been one of the countries worldwide confronted with the COVID-19 outbreak. The Italian PMR Society (SIFMER) has published recommendations to ensure appropriate interventions to persons in need of rehabilitation in acute care, inpatient rehabilitation care and outpatient and home-based rehabilitation services [4] . Koh and Hoenig recently published a paper on interventions to prevent spreading of the virus in the rehabilitation community [5] .",
