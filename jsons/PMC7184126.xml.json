It is the leading cause of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Newly emerged anti-HCV viral agents have recently become available on the market but with serious complications, high cost, and possible development of resistance. This has encouraged scientists to search for alternative, safer antiviral approaches. Nanoparticles offer unique physical properties that have associated benefits for antimicrobial activity or as drug carrier that can improve antiviral therapy. The significance of our research is in establishment of a natural nanoparticle drug carrier system that we screened with computer simulation studies and in cells against HCV-4a replication into human hepatoblastoma cell line. This may serve as a model for the screening of newly developed antiviral agents targeting HCV-4a to help in controlling this chronic disease.",

In addition, the high mutation rate of viral RNA and development of mutant resistant strains has slowed development of innovative anti-HCV drugs.

The FTIR spectra of chitosan, curcumin, and CuCs nanocomposite are shown in Figure 2C. Characteristic bands at 1511 cm\u22121 and 1062 cm\u22121 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of the C=C vibrations, and C-O-C stretching modes, respectively, in curcumin. For CsNPs, the characteristic band at 3450 cm\u22121 was assigned to stretching vibration mode of N-H overlapped with O-H stretching vibration mode, the band at 2880 cm\u22121 was due to C-H stretching vibration mode, the band at 1653 cm\u22121 was assigned to the C=O, and the band at 1428 cm\u22121 was assigned to bending vibration of N-H stretching vibration. In comparison with curcumin, a different spectrum was observed for CuCs nanocomposite as new bands appeared at 1070 cm\u22121 and the N-H group of CsNPs disappeared (Table 2). It can be assumed that the ammonium groups of chitosan were linked with OH groups of curcumin to form the nanocomposite.

Therefore, discovery of more effective and less toxic antiviral agents is still needed. Computational screening of large chemical libraries using molecular docking and the establishment of HCV culture model has led to numerous studies and the discovery of many anti-HCV agents. Accordingly, we started working on CsNPs,19 and the in silico results demonstrated high binding affinity towards HCV-4a target proteins (NS3 protease, NS5B polymerase, and NS5A helicase) and this encouraged us to continue our research on CsNPs as a drug delivery system for antiviral agents, hoping to increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease therapeutic dose. In the current research, curcumin was encapsulated into CsNPs and evaluated for its antiviral activity against HCV-4a first with in silico analysis and subsequently with in vitro studies, with the hope to discover new candidates for use as HCV-4a inhibitors. Our in silico analysis gave promising results by showing an increase in the affinity of our designed nanocomposite against HCV-4a NS5B compared to curcumin alone, suggesting its potential role against viral replication, first with in silico analysis and subsequently with in vitro studies, to discover new candidates for use as HCV-4a inhibitors.

In addition, its physicochemical properties are unstable in several conditions like neutral pH or alkaline pH \u22657.0, and ambient temperature.36 Therefore, we conjugated curcumin into CsNPs to improve its properties, control its release, and enhance its antiviral activity. Our preparation was performed at acidic pH with certain modifications,26 using ascorbic acid as solvent for CsNPs instead of acetic acid, where positive charges of amino groups on chitosan can interact with negative charges on OH of curcumin through electrostatic interactions, leading to formation of CuCs nanocomposite. This binding property was found to be much less at neutral or alkaline pH due to the higher tendency of CsNPs to aggregate because of neutralization of the amino groups on CsNPs.17 Our HPLC experiment demonstrated 4% entrapment of curcumin into CsNPs after 6 minutes of polymeric digestion; this time needs to be lengthened in the future preparations. Drug release profile showed that 50% of loaded curcumin was released during the first 11 minutes\u2014the release time known as \u201cburst release\u201d meaning the amount of curcumin deposited on the outer surface of the CsNPs\u2014and 34% of curcumin was released at 120 minutes. This means that the total release of curcumin (84%) was obtained after 2 hours. Afterward, a relatively constant release of curcumin was observed for the next 4 hours (ie 240 minutes). This is supported by results of Akhtar et al who reported pharmacokinetic analysis for chitosan bound to curcumin in parasite Plasmodium yoelii infected mice.17 They found that the curcumin concentration detected in the blood was significantly higher in mice fed with curcumin loaded onto CsNPs compared to blood from mice administered an equimolar concentration of curcumin alone. Results showed that administration of CsNPs orally ensured a sustained release of curcumin over 8 hours post-feeding, whereas, in the case of curcumin alone, the levels declined significantly after 3 hours and were not detectable beyond 6 hours.",

This might be due to the small amount of DNA content and admission into programmed cell death, as previously illustrated by Kumar et al.42 The results of molecular apoptotic gene expression level of cells treated with an IC50 concentration of curcumin and its composite showed high expression levels in caspase 3 and lowered expression of Bcl2 in Huh7 cells treated with curcumin and its nanocomposite. This indicates that the apoptosis was induced via a caspase-dependent pathway. Such cytotoxic effect could be due to the production of reactive oxygen species in response to the toxic dose of curcumin, resulting in DNA breakage, which in turn causes activation of p53 that can recruit other molecules like Bax, Bak. This, in turn, causes pores in the mitochondria membrane, disrupting its membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c, which stimulates a cascade of death compounds and ultimately cell death.43 Finally, protein expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 8, p53, and Bcl2 were detected using ELISA assay. Cells treated with paclitaxel, a standard anticancer drug served as a control. Our results matched that of mRNA transcriptional level, which showed an increase in the expression levels of caspase 3, caspase 8, and p53 proteins and a decrease in the expression levels of Bcl2 protein compared to untreated Huh7. These results confirmed the designated roles of the nanocomposite in mediation in the apoptotic process through cell death receptors and induction of apoptosis through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.44,45",

Moreover, our data match those of Anggakusuma et al who reported that curcumin nanoformulation increased its antiviral activity with no toxic effect; they demonstrated that the antiviral mechanism occurred by affecting virion membrane fluidity without disrupting virion integrity.10 In the present study, the same observations were obtained upon analyzing antiviral activity against replication of HCV-4a; these results confirm the in silico analysis and demonstrate the dual roles of CsNPs and its composite to inhibit both viral entry and replication. These results were confirmed with HCV core protein expression using Western blot assay, which demonstrated a remarkable decrease in the expression level after the treatment of cells with CsNPs, curcumin, and nanocomposite. Nevertheless, the nanocomposite exhibited the lowest decrease in the HCV core protein expression, which indicates that the nanocomposite has the highest antiviral activity whether against viral entry or replication. Further investigations are still required to study the anti-HCV activity of nanocomposite in the replicating system, which is underway in our laboratory.",
