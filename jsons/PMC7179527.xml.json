For example, substitution of U-5 with C (C-variant, fig. 1b) yields a significantly higher affinity for coat protein than wild-type pac site in vitro [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. It has also been confirmed that the presence of a second pac site permits the cooperative binding of the coat protein dimer to the RNA and results in a higher affinity compared with a single pac site [17, 18]. Recently, Wei et al. [19] successfully used armored RNA technology to package 2,248 bases exogenous RNA sequences by a two-plasmid coexpression system with the C-variant pac site.",

The primers described above were shown in table 1. The purified PCR products and the pET-MS2-pac plasmid were then digested with the Not I restriction enzyme, respectively.
