Furthermore, respiratory failure requiring arti fi cal ventialtion is a well recognised reason for intensive care support but it can be dif fi cult to determine if this is due to an underlying non-infectious condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infection or a combination of both. The early diagnosis and management of respiratory infection combined with appropriate ventilatory support aids prognosis and the ef fi cient use of intensive care facilities given the number of patients affected.",

Patients with underlying COPD are most likely to bene fi t from NIV [ 8 ] . Patients with CAP who were randomized to receive NIV had more than a 25 % absolute risk reduction for intubation [ 9 ] . Inability to cough may limit the use of NIV, but intermittent application of NIV may allow for its use in patients with productive cough without excessive sputum production. Prompt recognition of a failed NIV trial is important, as patients who require intubation after a prolonged NIV trial have a worse outcome. Within the fi rst 1-2 h of NIV, failure to improve respiratory rate and oxygenation or failure to decrease carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2 ) in patients with initial hypercarbia predicts NIV failure and warrants prompt intubation. NIV provides no bene fi t for patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be indistinguishable from CAP among patients with bilateral alveolar in fi ltrates.
