Although T\u00e9g\u00e9line is obtained from plasma donors in continental France, where CHIKV is absent, after the outbreak in La R\u00e9union, the Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang implemented measures to prevent CHIKV transmission by transfusion in continental France, and all symptomatic travelers returning from areas where CHIKV circulates are excluded from donation for 2 weeks. T\u00e9g\u00e9line exhibits no immunoreactivity against CHIKV, both in IgG-ELISA and neutralization assays. CHIKVIg was purified after the T\u00e9g\u00e9line manufacturing process from a pool of 583 plasma samples from donors vaccinated against CHIKV and from plasma for fractionation that was used by the Laboratoire Fran\u00e7ais du Fractionnement et des Biotechnologies to manufacture plasma-derived therapeutic products, including human Ig and coagulation factors. In brief, T\u00e9g\u00e9line and CHIKVIg were prepared from plasma by fractionation and purification steps, including filtrations.

For passive transfer of human immune plasma A, B, and C or CHIKVIg, adult mice and mouse neonates were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 mL and 0.2 mL, respectively, of the indicated doses immediately or at different times after CHIKV inoculation.

Plasma samples were collected from September through October 2006. The delay between the clinical episode and donation was at least 6 months. In addition to mandatory viral screenings (see Methods), all plasma samples were controlled negative for CHIKV RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In a subgroup of 80 donors, 71 (88.7%) had anti-CHIKVIg detected by sandwich ELISA at the time of plasma sample obtainment. Of the 71 plasma samples positive by ELISA, 85.9% displayed an in vitro neutralization activity, with titers of 20\u2013160, whereas 4.2% displayed high neutralization titers (>320), and 9.9% exhibited no neutralization activity (<20) (figure 1A). To determine whether ELISA and neutralization titers correlated, 27 randomly selected samples were assayed. ELISA titers in plasma samples were 500\u20132000 and did not correlate with neutralization titers (figure 1B)",

The fear for a pandemic of CHIKV infection arises from its possible dissemination by rapid long-distance travels and its transmissibility by urban mosquito vectors [32]. In humans, CHIKV produces a sudden debilitating disease because of its incapacitating joint symptoms. Moreover, CHIKV infection is a cause of neuropathology, particularly in elderly persons and neonates and can be fatal in these patients. There is currently neither specific treatment nor vaccine available for CHIKV infection.

Follow-up of healthy volunteers vaccinated with an attenuated CHIKV strain has provided evidence of persistence of significant antibodies with in vitro neutralizing activity after 12 months [33, 34]. In the present study, we provide evidence that, similar to what was observed in individuals vaccinated with an attenuated CHIKV strain, naturally infected individuals still have circulating neutralizing antibodies up to 12 months after acute CHIKV infection. In our study, the detection rate of anti-CHIKV antibodies by ELISA in 80% of donors results from the clinical criteria used for selecting the donors of the immunoreactivity study. Thus, in the context of a high prevalence of CHIKV infection (e.g., \u223c33% of the R\u00e9unionese population) and a selection of plasma donors in the early postepidemic period, purified anti-CHIKVIg (exhibiting in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activities) can be obtained by applying the classical procedure used to produce the purified polyvalent Ig T\u00e9g\u00e9line to plasma samples from donors selected only on the basis of clinical criteria. This approach demonstrates the possibility to easily recruit donors and produce massive amounts of CHIKVIg in the context of a vast epidemic",

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of pre- and postexposure protection conferred by CHIKVIg in immunocompromised adult mice and immunocompetent mouse neonates. These mouse models of CHIKV infection exhibit the features characterizing severe human CHIKV infection [19]: in both models, a single dose of CHIKV immune human plasma or CHIKVIg inhibited viral dissemination and abrogated lethality associated with CHIKV when administered at least 8 h after infection, and the level of protection correlates with the amount of antibodies transferred. The fact that the dose of CHIKVIg that protected 100% of animals was higher for adult mice (830 mg/kg) than for mouse neonates (100 mg/kg) likely results from the higher susceptibility of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 mouse model. Indeed, the LD100 in WT mouse neonates is 106 PFU, and it is only 10 PFU in adult IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 mice; the mean survival time is shorter for adult IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 mice than for infected mouse neonates [19]. Nevertheless, total protection can be obtained regardless of the mouse IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 status and the age of animals. Moreover, CHIKVIg administration completely abolishes viral dissemination into serum and the brain and strongly alleviates liver and muscle infection. It is noteworthy that the 100-mg/kg dose of CHIKVIg did not completely inhibit viral replication in muscle of mouse neonates by day 6 after infection, although the 830-mg/kg dose abolished muscle infection in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 mice. Indeed, we have previously shown that after intradermal injection, CHIKV is detectable first in liver and then in blood before reaching its peripheral target tissues: the muscles, joints, and skin [19]. In the present study, we found that CHIKVIg strongly restricts liver infection and viremia and totally blocks CHIKV dissemination to the CNS. These data suggest that liver infection and viremia precedes virus spreading to the CNS and that control of liver infection and viremia by anti-CHIKV antibodies is sufficient to prevent CNS infection. Similarly, it has been shown that administration of anti\u2013West Nile virus antibodies in mice infected with West Nile virus prevents CNS infection [37, 38]",

Numerous studies have shown the importance of neutralizing antibodies in recovery and protection from viral infections. In addition to the neutralization of virus-host interactions in vivo, protective antibodies can exert their beneficial effect via other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent and complement-mediated cellular cytoxicity attributed to Fc\u03b3R engagement. In this study, antibodies from plasma B samples, which had low neutralizing activity, conferred protection against CHIKV, as was previously shown for Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, for which Fc\u03b3R engagement is thought to be essential [39]",

In particular, hyperimmune human IgG is used as a standard prevention therapy of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and varicella-zoster viruses. Polyclonal Ig therapy has also been used with success for parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and West Nile virus infections [23\u201325]. Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections were treated with convalescent patient plasma containing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus polyclonal antibodies [40, 41], and purification of severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus hyperimmune Ig from pooled convalescent plasma has also been reported [42].

Nondiluted CHIKVIg (25 mg; 830 mg/kg) or diluted CHIKVIg (from 1:2 [12.5 mg; 415 mg/kg] to 1:128 [0.195 mg; 6.5 mg/kg]) were administered as a single dose via intraperitoneal route immediately after CHIKV injection. Data correspond to at least 10 mice per condition. Statistical differences in the comparison with PBS controls were as follows: CHIKVIg (25 mg) and CHIKVIg 1:2\u20131:32, P<.001; CHIKVIg 1:64 and 1:128, P>.9. D Viral titers in tissue and serum samples from mice inoculated with 106 PFU of CHIKV via the intradermal route and injected with PBS, normal IgG, or CHIKVIg. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated times, and the amount of infectious virus in serum and tissue samples was quantified by tissue cytopathic infectious dose 50 (TCID50). Each data point represents the arithmetic mean\u00b1standard deviation for at least 4 mice. A broken line indicates the detection threshold",
