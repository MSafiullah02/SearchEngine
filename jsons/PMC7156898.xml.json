The best NT-proBNP cut-off was that of the highest product of sensitivity and specificity for in-hospital death prediction. Cumulative survival curves of in-hospital death were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation method with the log-rank test. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the coefficients of NT-proBNP with selected covariates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to screening out the potential risk factors and analyzing the independent effect of NT-proBNP for in-hospital death. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Severe COVID-19 patients with high NT-proBNP levels tended to be older with increased cardiac injury markers and higher levels of systematic inflammation markers. Patients with high NT-proBNP (> 88.64 pg/mL) level had lower cumulative survival rate. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.",

The elevated NT-proBNP in these cases was believed owing to the cardiac complications resulted from complex interactions among preexisting conditions, relative ischemia, up-regulation of the sympathetic system, systemic inflammation and direct pathogen-mediated damage to the cardiovascular system [11].",
