Like so many other disasters in the past, such as war, famine, social unrest and economic calamities, this too shall pass, but it will undoubtedly leave the world changed. Some of the changes are already evident, but some are inevitable once we get over this pandemic. In this perspective, I provide examples of how the virus is already inducing change in the practice of medicine at large and for nephrology in particular. As is true for many changes, some persist after the emergency is over, so I speculate on how nephrology may change once we surmount this predicament (Figure 1).\n",

Within days after the epidemic unfolded in North America, two young physicians, Matthew Sparks and Swapnil Hiremath, curated an annotated resource for use by nephrologists [1]. With a group of colleagues, they were among the first to address the question of whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped in patients who are taking these drugs. Their answer\u2014which was to continue to take these medications\u2014was later supported both by a statement from the European Society of Cardiology [2] and a scholarly review in the New England Journal of Medicine [3]. In the context of the epidemic, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization, a large randomized worldwide trial was launched to evaluate outcomes of various drug regimens [4]. Medical journals collaborated with their readers. For example, JAMA sent out a call for ideas to conserve personal protective equipment, which was in short supply [5]. Engineers and physicians collaborated both at Oxford, UK [6] and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA [7] to innovate low-cost ventilators that they made open source. The fight against the virus made humans unite, collaborate and forget their differences\u2014it was a demonstration of global solidarity.",

The virus brought the most innovative ideas to the forefront. The first set of tests required to detect COVID-19 required hours and sometimes days to be reported. This was impeding the fight against the virus. Abbott Diagnostics, a Chicago-based company, established a rapid test that could be performed using a point-of-care device, most units of which were already in use in urgent care facilities, where they were used to diagnose influenza A and B, Strep A and respiratory syncytial virus [8]. A positive test could be available in 5 min and a negative test in 13 min. A low-cost COVID-19 test was developed in India and the team was led by a woman in late-stage pregnancy; she delivered a baby soon after submitting the test for approval [9]. The cost of this test was one-third of what was being paid from tests coming from outside the country.",

Each 1% increase in quarterly influenza-like illness associates with a 1.5\u20132.0% increase in all-cause mortality among dialysis patients. These mortality rates are similar to mortality estimates for COVID-19 in the general population. Accordingly, such surveillance efforts may be particularly valuable to institute measures similar to those implemented in the COVID-19 pandemic [11]. Sharing of such data will need a national plan and should cross boundaries of data ownership for societal good. Extending this further, longitudinal data for individual patients using the algorithms of artificial intelligence may even provide diagnostic information for patients and serve as an early sign of infection or a cardiovascular event.",

COVID-19 was pushing all other diseases by the wayside, and telemedicine rapidly emerged. Many of the rules that would have taken years to be approved were passed almost overnight. Visits to patients using cameras next to the dialysis machine or by phone were rapidly adopted. Many practices started seeing patients by telehealth visits.",

If insurance companies pay for these services at a lower rate, but this lower rate is offset by an increase in volume, it may drive more telemedicine in the future.
