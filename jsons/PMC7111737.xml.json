In the original Barton\u2013McCombie method,8 thionocarbonates or xanthates are efficiently reduced using tributyltin hydride (n-Bu3SnH) which is the hydrogen atom source, and the corresponding tin radical (n-Bu3Sn\u2022) is the radical chain carrier.

Hence, we needed a universal glycosyl donor, namely, the \u03b1,\u03b2-1,2-di-O-acetyl-5-O-benzoyl-3-deoxyribofuranose 6. This compound can be readily obtained after the radical reduction of the suitably activated analogue of the 3-hydroxy-xylofuranose 3.

However, we wished to concentrate on the use of thiocarbonylimidazolyl activated compounds, as they are more easily and efficiently prepared from a simple reaction of the corresponding hydroxyl analogue with 1,1\u2032-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (TCDI).18, 19, 20 To our knowledge, only one case of a free radical reduction of a thiocarbonylimidazolyl nucleoside by a P\u2013H bond containing reagent was ever reported using 10 M equiv of it and the reaction yield was rather low.17 Thus, we decided to investigate the free radical deoxygenation of 5-O-benzoyl-1,2-isopropylidene-3-O-imidazolylthiocarbonyl-\u03b1-d-xylofuranose 4 by dimethyl phosphite as a key step reaction in a multi gram scale synthesis towards the glycosyl precursor for 3\u2032-deoxynucleosides 6 (Scheme 1\n).",

Efficient \u2018dehomologation\u2019 of the di-O-isopropylidenehexofuranose was carried out by a sequential selective acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the terminal acetal and oxidative cleavage of the corresponding diol, followed by reduction of the resulting aldehyde, as previously reported by Robins et al.21 The resulting xylofuranose 2\n21 was selectively benzoylated on the primary hydroxyl giving 3\n22 and after work-up the crude was directly treated with 1.2 M equiv of TCDI which reacted with the sole remaining hydroxyl providing the desired 3-O-imidazolylthiocarbonyl derivative 4 in good yield (58% from d-glucose) after silica gel chromatography.23 This compound was then reacted with dimethyl phosphite and portion-added benzoyl peroxide in boiling dioxane, following Barton\u2019s protocol.13 Reduction proceeded smoothly and the desired deoxy sugar 5\n22 was obtained after evaporation, under vacuum, of the solvents and the dimethyl phosphite excess and eventually chromatography purification.24 It is worth noting that using only 10 M equiv of dimethyl phosphite gave low yields, and best results were obtained when 30\u201350 M equiv was used, as yields rose from good to excellent (80\u201393%). Finally, a two-step \u2018one-pot\u2019 procedure of acidic hydrolysis of the 1,2-O-isopropylidene protection followed by 1,2-O-acetylation, provided the expected 3-deoxy glycosyl donor 6.25 As an example for glycosylation, we successfully coupled 6 with either N\n4-benzoyl- or N\n4-acetyl-cytosine using Vorbr\u00fcggen\u2019s conditions,26 providing 3\u2032-deoxycytidine5, 27 with a 90% yield after ammonia deprotection (Scheme 2\n).",

Reaction proceeds smoothly and with good yields. The present method is useful for the preparation of a common 3-deoxy glycosyl donor for 3\u2032-deoxynucleosides. We believe that good reaction yields and safety and cost advantages of this method would make it more applicable on laboratory or industrial scale.",
