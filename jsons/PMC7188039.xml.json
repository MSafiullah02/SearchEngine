For example, as the nearest hospital to the Huanan Seafood Market, the hospital designated as H4 in our study had the highest infection rate of 20.7% and was among the very first hospitals in Wuhan that admitted patients with COVID-19.

During the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan, because of the serious shortage in virus test kits, testing for the pathogen could be performed only in suspected cases with symptoms that were severe or not self-limited. The real situation regarding how many patients in the orthopaedic wards had the comorbidity of COVID-19 was unknown. One surgeon consulted in the intensive care unit, where there was a patient with traumatic injury and fever of an unknown origin, which was later diagnosed as due to COVID-19. Three surgeons were exposed during operations on patients who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 several days after the surgical procedures. Thus, it is wise to minimize, postpone, or cancel elective operations during the pandemic. Family members of the patients and visitors also could be the source of virus in the wards. Public places at hospitals (e.g., elevators) could be contaminated and the virus could be transmitted from there by contact or droplet.",

This limited knowledge may be due to little or no experience of these orthopaedic surgeons to cope with the highly contagious diseases in their routine practices, insufficient training in higher levels of infection prevention and control measures, and, in some cases, even a lack of awareness of the importance of such measures. The effect of real-time training could not be well defined in the current study because some of the surgeons were exposed before such training became available in the middle to late January.",

The vigilance could help doctors to ensure compliance with infection prevention and control procedures, as shown in our results that a higher ratio of orthopaedic surgeons in the control group wore the respirators and/or masks all of the time than orthopaedic surgeons in the case group did.",

The case-control study design was useful to test the possible link between the exposures and the outcome, but not to confirm the causal relationship, and recall bias could have occurred because of its nature. Nevertheless, because the recall period in the study was less than about 1 month, we assumed that the recall bias, if any, would have been minor. The number of surgeons infected could have be higher than reported, as we could have missed the infected orthopaedic surgeons in some small hospitals, but we assume that the number will be very small.",

Have the patients tested for COVID-19 before the operation if resources allow. Place face masks on patients.For the orthopaedic surgeons who still work in hospital settings, it is wise to adhere to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for infection prevention and control and to wear N95 respirators all of the time when necessary during the pandemic.After being exposed in environments contaminated by patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, orthopaedic surgeons should manage to avoid close contact with family members at home and maintain social distancing in other situations.Orthopaedic surgeons should try to avoid long-term overwork and fatigue, which could compromise immunity against COVID-19.",
