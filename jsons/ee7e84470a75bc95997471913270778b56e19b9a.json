The major disadvantage of this technique is that mechanical disturbances to the electrodes are in the same frequency and magnitude range as the desired signal. In this work we propose an approach and a realized measurement system to combine EMG and bioimpedance measurements for higher reliabilities of muscle contraction detections. Methods: We propose the development of a modular four-channel measurement system, whereat each channel is capable of acquiring EMG, the bioimpedance magnitude and phase, simultaneously. The modules are synchronized by an additional interface board, which communicates with a PC. A graphical user interface enables to control the bioimpedance excitation current in a range from 100 \u00b5A to 1 mA in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 333 kHz. Results: A system characterization demonstrated that bioimpedance magnitude changes of less than 250 ppm and phase changes below 0.05\u00b0 can be detected reliably.",

            "text": "N the past several years the detection of muscle contractions has become an important technique in biomedical engineering. It can either be acquired at a single position of the body to analyze the state of a single muscle (group) or it is acquired at different positions simultaneously. The gathered information is commonly used to control computer systems, Manuscript robots, exoskeletons or prostheses [1] , [2] , [3] . Especially for the last example, a high reliability is important to avoid misinterpretations of the signals, which could cause dangerous situations to the user. The commonly used measurement technique to detect muscle contractions is the Electromyography (EMG) [4] . This method is based on acquiring the action potentials of the contracted muscles [5] . Typically, these signals result in differential voltages in millivolt ranges at the body surface and can be acquired using surface electrodes [6] . Since the most dominant signal frequency range is from 10 Hz up to 100 Hz [7] , the electrical measurement instrumentation can be very elementary. Further methods to detect muscle contractions are the mechanomyography (MMG) [8] and optical setups [9] . Algorithms to combine a set of several signals to get information about movements are often machine-learning based [10] . One of the most challenging problems are motion artifacts, since the fixation of optical, ultrasound or acceleration sensors to the human body is problematic. But also the most commonly acquired EMG signal is very sensitive to motion artifacts [11] . Especially, forces to the electrode-skin interfaces result in significant signal disturbances [12] . Since these disturbances are in a similar frequency range like the actual EMG signal, it is difficult to differentiate between both of them. A promising measurement technique which might be more robust towards these disturbances is the electrical impedance myography (EIM). This technique is based on measuring the changes of the muscles' electrical bioimpedance, which occur during muscle contractions, caused by geometrical changes [13] , [14] . The major advantage of this measurement method is that muscle contraction information is modulated onto an excitation current of much higher frequency than that of motion artifacts. Therefore, the subsequent filtering of motion artifacts is very simple. Obviously, it is also advantageous to extend the EMG information by the two additional dimensions of information, the magnitude and the phase of the bioimpedance (BioZ). In this work, we propose a measurement method to acquire EMG signals as well as bioimpedance signals simultaneously from the human body to increase the reliability of muscle contraction detections. After explaining the measurement approach, we describe the development of a four-channel measurement system, capable of acquiring the EMG signal and the magnitude as well as the phase of the bioimpedance at four different positions of the human body. The developed system is focused, but not limited to the usage in combination with upper limb prostheses. After a system characterization, measurements from a human subject demonstrate the behavior of EIM signals in comparison to EMG signals. Additionally, the robustness towards motion artifacts of both the methods is shown. Finally, all four channels are used to measure five common hand gestures and to compare the resulting signals. For comparison purposes, this measurement is repeated for two isometric hand gestures.",

Two additional electrodes (E3 and E4) are used do acquire the occurring voltage drop. Because of the significant influence of the electrode-skin interfaces [16] , the electrodes are modelled as serial circuits consisting of electrode-skin impedances (ZESI) and DC voltage sources (VHC), representing the occurring half-cell voltages.

It can be seen that the EMG behavior of CH1 (blue) during both the movements has a similar behavior. In contrast, the corresponding impedance magnitude signals of CH1 differ completely from each other. The same effect can be found when comparing the EMG data with the impedance phase signal. For example, the EMG signals of CH4 look similar during the WE and the HO motion, whereas the behavior of the corresponding impedance phases is opposite during both the muscle contractions.

The information of both kinds of signals can be combined by applying machine learning algorithms.
