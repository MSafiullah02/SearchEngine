While it is difficult to estimate the total number of disease causing viral infections, the mortality caused by some specific viral pathogens is well described. Today, antiviral drugs are only available for the treatment of infections with (i) HIV, (ii) some DNA viruses (herpes viruses, hepatitis B virus, poxviruses) and (iii) a small number of RNA viruses (HCV, RSV, and influenza virus). Decades of rigorous effort were needed to develop these drugs and specific therapy is still lacking for the treatment of infections by all other RNA viruses, leaving supportive care as the only option.",

As in other disease areas the contribution of phenotypic screening to the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs exceeds that of target-based approaches (Swinney and Anthony, 2011). The main phenotype used in antiviral assays is the development of a virus induced cythopathic effect (CPE). If a virus infection renders sufficient CPE in cell culture then standard viability assays (ex. MTS reduction) are feasible to detect viral and antiviral activity. However if the CPE is limited than more complicated and expensive tools are needed (ex ATP quantitation).",

This method uses a \u201cdead-cell protease substrate\u201d, which contains a fluorophore (R110) quenched by the covalent linkage of two Ala-Ala-Phe peptides (bis-AAF-R110). The method can be used to detect cell death since proteolytic-cleavage by proteases, released from dead cells, restores the fluorophore (Niles et al., 2007) (Fig. 1\n). This method was developed further for the quantitation of limited CPE. The read-out is homogeneous and rather inexpensive and therefore amendable to medium- or high-throughput screening campaigns. In this paper the method is described as a solution to screen for inhibitors of human coronavirus. The human Coronavirus NL63 is used as a model system since it uses the same cellular receptor as the SARS-virus (ACE2). HCoV-NL63 causes only limited CPE on different cell lines (Schildgen et al., 2006) making CPE quantitation troublesome with classical viability staining (ex MTS reduction).",

This CytoTox-Fluor\u2122 assay has been developed to quantitate cell-death based on the cleavage of the bis-AAF-R110 peptide by proteases released from dead cells (Niles et al., 2007). In this experiment the assay was used according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Results are presented in Fig. 2\n. For both virusstocks a very good correlation between the observed levels of CPE and the increased levels of fluorescence are observed. This indicates that the release of proteases by cultures that develop CPE and the subsequent cleavage of the bis-AAF-R110 peptide to its fluorescent substrate can be used to quantitate CPE. When a similar experiment was carried out using other methods to detect cell viability such as the MTS reduction method (Fig. 3\n) or the quantitation of LDH release (data not shown), no significant difference between infected and non-infected cell cultures could be observed.",

The amount of peptide used under these conditions is 3x lower than proposed by the manufacturer of the Cytotox-Fluor\u2122 assay. Using lower levels of peptide results in a decreased signal but the signal-to-noise ratio remains sufficient high to be used under screening conditions (see below). The main reason to lower the amount of peptide is to make a screening campaign affordable.",

In addition the antiviral activity of a known SARS inhibitor, that is, Anti-ACE2 IgG was evaluated. This antibody inhibits SARS virus replication by binding ACE2 and preventing the virus to enter the cell (Li et al., 2003, Ivens et al., 2005). The experiment was set-up as a standard antiviral experiment in which the antibody was diluted in medium at different concentrations in duplicate after which virus and cells were added. In the same way a polyclonal goat IgG was used as a control. Untreated infected (virus controls), and treated uninfected (cell controls) cultures were included on each plate (6 wells each). On day 5 p.i. one plate was analyzed using the CytoTox-Fluor\u2122 kit according to manufacturers\u2019 protocol (except that the peptide was used at a 3\u00d7 lower concentration). In brief the peptide solution was diluted 1/600 in assay buffer (as supplied with the kit) and 20 \u03bcL/well was added to the 96-well plate. The other plate was analyzed in parallel using the custom made peptide. To this end a 100 mM DMSO stock of the peptide was diluted 1/600 in assay medium and 20 \u03bcL/well was added (final peptide concentration 16 \u03bcM). Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 90\u2032 and following thorough shaking the plates were read. Results are presented in Fig. 4\n. The performance of the custom prepared peptide batch was comparable to that of the CytoTox-Fluor\u2122 kit. A Z\u2019 factor of 0.73 and 0.70 was calculated in this experiment for the custom prepared and commercial peptide respectively. A Z\u2019 > 0.5 indicates sufficient quality for screening (Zhang et al., 1999). In addition the results show that the Anti-ACE2 IgG inhibits in vitro HCoV-NL63 replication with an EC50\n \u223c 0.3 \u03bcg/mL. The polyclonal goat IgG, used as a negative control, showed an EC50\n > 10 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 4). It has been reported previously that the anti-ACE2 IgG is not toxic at concentrations up to 125 \u03bcg/mL (Li et al., 2003, Ivens et al., 2005). Also in the experiment above no effect of the anti-ACE2 IgG on cellular morphology could be observed microscopically (data not shown). The antiviral activity found is \u223c3\u00d7 more pronounced than the activity against the SARS coronavirus (Li et al., 2003, Ivens et al., 2005). This is not unexpected since both viruses are known to bind the ACE2 receptor differently and have evolved independently in their ability to use it for cellular entry (Wu et al., 2011).",

The assay principle relies on the detection of proteases released from dead cells by using the bis-AAF-R110 peptide, which upon cleavage, turns fluorescent. The main advantage of this method, in comparison to cell viability measurements such as the MTS reduction or LDH release methods, is the sensitive detection of limited virus induced CPE. This allows its use in antiviral screening campaigns with viruses that cause only limited levels of CPE. In addition the assay is highly homogenous (no washing steps) and affordable. In our hands the cost of substrate is \u223c\u20ac0.03/well. Another advantage is the non-destructive nature of the method, allowing microscopic inspection and simultaneous or sequential use of other assay methods in the same well (for example to evaluate toxic or anti-proliferative effects of the compounds). Because the method is non-destructive the samples remain infectious. In general this is not a limitation as fluorescence can be measured in most plate readers with the plate lid covering the plate.",
