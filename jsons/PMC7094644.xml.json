            "text": "\nCryptosporidium spp. are ubiquitous protozoan parasites of vertebrates. Globally, the zoonotic species, Cryptosporidium parvum, is a common species in, and a cause of diarrhoea in, preweaned calves. Infection is most prevalent between 1and 3 weeks of age (Nydam et al., 2001, Sant\u00edn and Trout, 2008) and related symptoms are watery diarrhoea, inappetence, depression and sometimes death (Sant\u00edn and Trout, 2008). Calf diarrhoea is a multifactorial disease and co-infection with other pathogens or the presence of non-infectious diarrhoeal causes can lead to more severe disease and higher mortality rates. Traditionally, C. parvum has been diagnosed by microscopy of faecal smears or concentrated samples, with or without staining. However, two other species, Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium ryanae, with an oocystmorphology which is similar to C. parvum, can be identified in cattle using DNA analysis. Differentiation between these three species cannot be made by microscopy. Cryptosporidium bovis and C. ryanae are considered to be a pathogenic and are most prevalent after 1\u20132 months of age (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004, Fayer et al., 2006, Fayer et al., 2007, Langkjaer et al., 2006), but possible pathogenic effects of C. bovis on Cryptosporidium na\u00efve calves have not been investigated. Cryptosporidium parvum has been identified as the main species in young calves, responsible for >80% of Cryptosporidium infections (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004, Trotz-Williams et al., 2006, Fayer et al., 2007, Plutzer and Karanis, 2007, Broglia et al., 2008, Brook et al., 2009). However, in Sweden and some other countries, C. bovis is the most prevalent species in preweaned calves (Silverl\u00e5s, 2010; Wang et al., 2011, Budu-Amoako et al., 2012, Silverl\u00e5s and Blanco-Penedo, 2012). In Sweden, C. bovis constituted 50% of the infections during the second week of life and was the most common species from 2 weeks of age. The species was also detected in a number of diarrhoeal calf samples (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010a, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010b). Cryptosporidium analysis has been offered as a part of routine diagnostic services of diarrhoeal calf faecal samples at the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) for many years, but diagnostic procedures do not include species determination. If the Cryptosporidium spp. distribution in diarrhoeal calves is the same as in Swedish dairy calves in general, i.e. there is a high C. bovis prevalence, species determination should be included in routine diagnostic procedures in order to make it possible to estimate the clinical relevance of Cryptosporidium infection.",

A total of 27 C. parvum subtypes were identified (Table 1). Sixteen new subtypes were identified and submitted to GenBank (Accession Numbers JX183796\u2013JX183811) (Table 1). Six subtypes had a unique number of TCA/TCG repeats, whereas 10 had the same number of repeats as previously reported subtypes but shifts in the TCG position within the repetitive region and/or one or two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the post-repetitive region compared with reported sequences. IIa subtypes were most common, with a dominance of subtype IIaA16G1R1 (Table 1).

In one of those three herds, only C. parvum was detected and samples with different subtypes were sent on the same occasion. In the other two herds, subtypes were identified in both C. parvum and mixed C. bovis/C. parvum samples. In one herd, samples were taken 8 months apart and subtypes differed in the C. parvum and mixed C. bovis/C. parvum samples. In the other herd, all samples were sent on the same occasion and two different subtypes were identified in the C. bovis/C. parvum sample, one of those being identical to the C. parvum subtype of that herd.

The dominance of C. parvum in Cryptosporidium-positive samples found here is in contrast to the results of our previous studies, where this species was only identified in 20% of samples from preweaned calves (Silverl\u00e5s, 2010). However, that study material was based on a random selection of dairy herds in Sweden, giving an estimate of species distribution in the average dairy herd and calf. In the current material, only diarrhoeal samples from herds with diarrhoeal problems were included, and species distribution was similar to what has been reported from other countries (Sant\u00edn et al., 2004, Langkjaer et al., 2006, Trotz-Williams et al., 2006, Plutzer and Karanis, 2007, Thompson et al., 2007). The fact that C. parvum-infected calves were younger than C. bovis-infected calves indicates that in herds harbouring C. parvum this is the primary species infecting newborn calves, or that if infection occurs at approximately the same time in Cryptosporidium na\u00efve calves, C. parvum will conquer C. bovis. Cryptosporidium parvum was not identified by ssrRNA sequencing after 42 days of age, and could only be detected as a minor species in older calves (up to 75 days of age) by ssrRNA-RFLP or GP60 analysis of C. bovis positive-samples. Age can thus be used to estimate clinical relevance and it seems that Cryptosporidium analysis is not relevant in diarrhoeal calves older than 6 weeks. The cut-off currently used is 2 months of age. In epidemiological studies, species determination is still an important tool, because species cannot be determined by microscopy and species distribution obviously differs with each study population.",

The identification of up to four other pathogens in most herds with Cryptosporidium infections confirms the complex aetiology of diarrhoeal disease, and this has to be taken into consideration when dealing with diarrhoeal problems. Calves with a TP of \u2a7e55 g/L are considered to have sufficient passive transfer (Radostits, O.M., 2000. The principles of control of infectious diseases of calves under 30 days of age. In: Proceedings from the XXI World Buiatrics Congress in Punta del Este, Uruguay, 4\u20138 December). Our results thus indicate that failure of passive transfer could be a part of the herds\u2019 problems, because half of the calves and herds fell below that level.",

In this study we identified 27 subtypes, of which 16 have not been reported previously. With three exceptions, only one subtype was present per herd. This indicates a stable within herd clonal pattern in the C. parvum population. Similar patterns have been identified in areas with closed herd management (Misic et al., 2006, Thompson et al., 2007, Brook et al., 2008, Soba and Logar, 2008). In areas with animal exchange between herds, fewer subtypes but two or more subtypes per herd is a common pattern (Peng et al., 2003, Trotz-Williams et al., 2006, Brook et al., 2008). Sweden generally has closed herd management, with the exception of fattening herds where calves are bought from different herds from about 2 weeks of age. It is thus not surprising that one of the herds with two subtypes was a fattening herd. The identification of two subtypes in a dairy herd is, however, unexpected. If animal exchange occurs in dairy herds, moved animals are usually heifers or cows, where C. parvum infection is not likely to be present (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010a, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010b). However, dairy herd size is increasing in Sweden, and thus animal exchange is likely to increase, which could affect the subtype clonality of C. parvum in the future.",
