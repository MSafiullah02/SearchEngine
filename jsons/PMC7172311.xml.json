            "text": "Due to the complexity of protein synthesis, viruses cannot encode all the components necessary for translation; therefore, they are dependent upon the availability and activity of cellular translation factors. During eukaryotic cap-dependent translation, initiation factors (eIF4F, the cap-binding complex), mediated by the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, recognize an m7GpppN-cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs (Gingras et al., 1999). The eIF4F cap-binding complex consists of eIF4E, an adaptor protein (eIF4G), and a helicase (eIF4A) that functions in complex with the co-factor eIF4B (Fig. 1A). In the cell, the 40S ribosome associates with the initiator methionyl-tRNA/eIF2-GTP ternary complex, eIF3, and eIF1A to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (Pestova et al., 2001). Only when bound to the RNA cap structure can the eIF4F complex, mediated by eIF3, recruit the 43S ribosomal complex to the mRNA (Gingras et al., 1999). This forms the 48S complex, which scans the RNA until the AUG initiation codon is encountered, at which point GTP is hydrolyzed, the initiation factors are released, the 60S ribosomal subunit binds the pre-initiation complex to form the 80S ribosome, and translation elongation begins (Pestova et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Two general mechanisms exist by which viruses initiate translation: cap-dependent and cap-independent. For the purpose of this review, the focus will be on mammalian positive-sense RNA viruses, with a particular emphasis on flaviviruses. Genomes of members of the viral families Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, and Togaviridae contain an m7GpppN-cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of mRNA and are presumed to initiate translation in a cap-dependent manner. In contrast, RNAs from a diverse group of viruses, which include members of the Caliciviridae, Flaviviridae, and Picornaviridae families, are able to bypass dependency upon an m7G cap structure for translation initiation via various mechanisms. Initiation of protein synthesis through the use of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is one such mechanism. The IRES element directs translation in the absence or with a reduced number of cellular translation factors, thus avoiding competition for scarce initiation factors, especially eIF4E, whose availability is among the most highly regulated within the cell (Gingras et al., 1999). Once cellular translation factors have bound to IRES RNA secondary and tertiary structure, they are used to direct ribosomal subunits to the translational start site in the absence of scanning.",

These functionally disparate viral IRES elements associate with different groups of translation factors. Most of the picornavirus IRES elements require the same translation initiation factors as capped mRNAs except for eIF4E, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and the N-terminal fragment of eIF4G (Lomakin et al., 2000, Ohlmann et al., 2002, Pestova et al., 1996). The HCV and pestivirus IRESes, on the other hand, can bind and position the 40S subunit specifically and stably in the absence of any eIF, such that the ribosomal P site is placed immediately upstream of the initiator AUG (Pestova et al., 1998). They do, however, require eIF3 for efficient translation initiation (Kieft et al., 2001, Sizova et al., 1998).",

Translation of mRNAs is most efficient when there is an interaction between the 5\u2032 cap structure and the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (Sachs et al., 1997, Tarun and Sachs, 1995). It has been shown that both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation are stimulated by factors that bind the poly(A) tail, presumably circularizing the mRNA (Bergamini et al., 2000, Michel et al., 2001). For many mRNAs, this 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 linkage is mediated by the interaction of the 5\u2032-bound eIF4G and the 3\u2032-bound poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), either directly (Otero et al., 1999, Tarun and Sachs, 1996) or via the bridging protein, PABP-interacting protein (PAIP-1) (Fig. 1A) (Craig et al., 1998). PABP may also interact specifically with ribosomal subunits through the use of RNA recognition motifs (RRM) within PABP, which allow it to bind directly to ribosomal RNA (Imataka et al., 1998).",

Despite the absence of a cap structure at the 5\u2032-end of the picornavirus genome, the presence of PABP has been shown to enhance initiation of translation from picornavirus IRES elements (Fig. 1C) (De Benedetti et al., 1991, Michel et al., 2001, Paulous et al., 2003). However, poly(A)-mediated stimulation of picornaviral IRES activity depends on the integrity of eIF4G and the interaction of intact eIF4G with PABP (Michel et al., 2001). Thus, since eIF4G is cleaved over the course of picornaviral infection, it is likely that this interaction is important only early in infection. Despite recent advances in understanding the role of the viral 3\u2032UTR in the regulation of translation, the function of mRNA circularization for IRES-dependent translation is not yet fully characterized.",

For example, sequences upstream of the poly(A) tail in the picornavirus 3\u2032UTR seem to be involved in the replication of the virus specifically in neuronal cells (Brown et al., 2004, Dobrikova et al., 2003). In addition to stimulating translation via a poly(A)/PABP interaction, sequences in the picornavirus 3\u2032UTR upstream of the poly(A) tail are able to enhance IRES-driven translation in the absence of the poly(A) (Lopez de Quinto et al., 2002). Various cellular proteins may play a role in this process. For example, the cellular proteins eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEFIA), La autoantigen (La), murine proliferation-associated protein-1 (Mppl), poly-r(C)-binding protein (PCBP), and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) have been shown to bind the 5\u2032UTR of picornaviruses and to enhance translation from picornavirus IRES elements (Blyn et al., 1996, Blyn et al., 1997, Borman et al., 1993, Florez et al., 2005, Hellen et al., 1993, Kolupaeva et al., 1996, Meerovitch et al., 1993, Pilipenko et al., 2000, Svitkin et al., 1994), and some of these cellular proteins have also been observed to bind to the 3\u2032UTR of the Norwalk calicivirus (La, PTB, and PABP) (Gutierrez-Escolano et al., 2003) and the HCV genomic RNA (PTB) (Fig. 1D) (Ito and Lai, 1999). Taken together, these observations suggest a potential means of communication between the viral UTRs wherein these cellular proteins interact with the viral RNA to functionally replace certain canonical translation factors.",

For example, circularization and translational enhancement of the m7G-capped rotavirus genome are mediated by the virally encoded protein NSP3, which binds to a conserved sequence in the viral 3\u2032UTR (UGUGACC) that functionally substitutes for the poly(A) tail. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of each segment of the rotavirus genome (six RNAs in total) are brought together through the direct interaction of the NSP3 protein and eIF4G (Fig. 1E) (Piron et al., 1998, Vende et al., 2000). An additional translation enhancer located only in the 3\u2032UTR of the rotavirus gene 6 mRNA has been shown to augment expression of the major capsid protein VP6 (Yang et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Finally, although flaviviruses, such as the dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) viruses, are not polyadenylated, the viral 3\u2032UTR contains conserved regions including: the terminal 100 nucleotides (nt), which form a conserved stem loop termed the 3\u2032SL (Brinton et al., 1986); structures that are predicted to form pseudoknots (Shi et al., 1996); and a 3\u2032 cyclization sequence (CS) that is complementary to a CS at the 5\u2032 end of the genome (Hahn et al., 1987). The DENV 3\u2032UTR has been shown to stimulate translation of reporter constructs (Edgil et al., 2003, Holden and Harris, 2004), and half of this stimulation can been attributed to the action of the 3\u2032SL (Fig. 1F) (Holden and Harris, 2004). This has been confirmed by other investigators who have found that the 3\u2032SL contributes significantly to translational enhancement by the 3\u2032UTR in DENV reporter constructs (Chiu et al., 2005). Consistent with these results, recent studies using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) directed to the top of the DENV 3\u2032SL demonstrated an approximately 50% reduction in translation using DENV reporter constructs and DENV replicons containing the nonstructural protein genes in addition to a luciferase reporter (Holden et al., in press). DENV replicons containing mutations in the loops at the top of the 3\u2032SL also reduced translation by approximately 50% compared to the wildtype replicon (K. Clyde, K.L. Holden, E. Harris, unpublished results). Furthermore, similar PMOs targeting the 3\u2032SL of WNV have recently been shown to reduce replication of WNV replicons (Deas et al., 2005), and mutations in the 3\u2032SL of infectious viral RNA negatively impact flavivirus RNA synthesis, host-range and viability (Markoff et al., 2002, Zeng et al., 1998). Conversely, an earlier study using WNV reporter constructs suggested that the WNV 3\u2032SL in the absence of the rest of the viral 3\u2032UTR may inhibit translation of reporter RNAs (Li and Brinton, 2001). While it is clear that the flavivirus 3\u2032UTR plays a role in the modulation of translation efficiency, the mechanism of action is likely regulated by many factors, including the genomic context of the 3\u2032SL.",

While the functional consequence of the interaction of these proteins with the 3\u2032UTR has not yet been demonstrated, it may serve to more effectively recruit and/or stabilize critical translation factors at the 5\u2032UTR. These ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes may mediate the interaction of the viral UTRs as well as play a role in the switch between translation and replication of the viral genome (see below).",

In the \u2018closed-loop\u2019 model of mRNA translation, it is thought that cyclization may serve to stabilize the mRNA and the translation complex. Furthermore, the interaction of the UTRs may ensure translation only of full-length RNAs that contain both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. However, under certain conditions, stimulation of translation of cellular mRNAs can be mediated by the poly(A) in trans in a cell-free system, suggesting that it is not circularization of mRNAs, but the interaction of the ends with the translational machinery that prompts maximal translation efficiency (Borman et al., 2002). Alternatively, circularization may promote efficient recycling of ribosomes and rapid re-initiation of translation on the same strand of RNA (Sachs, 2000). This strategy would be particularly advantageous for viral RNAs that need to compete effectively with cellular messages for limited translation factors and ribosomes.",

To investigate this phenomenon, several approaches were used to inhibit cap-dependent translation. Initially, the compounds rapamycin, wortmannin and LY294002 were used to suppress cellular translation initiation through the sequestration of eIF4E. The downstream effect of the interaction of rapamycin with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the hypo-phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP). Similarly, wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway, which also results in the hypo-phosphorylation of 4E-BP (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001). In its hypo-phosphorylated form, 4E-BP binds to and sequesters eIF4E from the eIF4F translation initiation complex, thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation. The impact of treatment with these drugs on translation of cellular cap-dependent mRNAs was compared to their effect on DENV reporter constructs and on replication of infectious viral RNA. When cells were incubated with DENV in the presence of rapamycin, LY294002 or wortmannin, viral titers remained unchanged at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with recent studies that have shown both DENV and JEV infection to be resistant to treatment with LY294002 (Lee et al., 2005). Furthermore, whereas metabolic labeling of total cellular protein in inhibitor-treated cells revealed an inhibition of cellular protein synthesis 12 h post-infection, translation of DENV proteins, represented by the DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5), was relatively unaffected (Fig. 2B).",

Luc activity was measured from RNA transcripts that were generated from the constructs above and transfected into cells in the presence of rapamycin, wortmannin, or LY294002.

Equal amounts of these RNAs were then transfected into cells treated with inhibitors of cap-dependent translation. When supernatants were analyzed by plaque assay 48 h post-transfection, cells containing the ApppA-capped viral RNA released no infectious progeny, compared with titers of \u223c103\n pfu/ml released by cells that had been transfected with the m7G-capped viral RNA (Table 1\n, column 1). These results suggest that, in cells competent for cap-dependent translation, DENV translates exclusively via its 5\u2032 m7G-cap structure. Replication of the m7G-capped viral RNAs was resistant to the presence of the inhibitors of cap-dependent translation (Table 1, row 1), similar to results obtained with the virus itself (Fig. 2A). Moreover, replication of the nonfunctionally capped viral genomes was increased to \u223c102\n pfu/ml (Table 1, row 2), indicating that the DENV viral genome can be induced to replicate independently of the cap structure under conditions of reduced eIF4E. This data is also consistent with increased levels of translation observed with ApppA-capped DENV reporter RNAs in inhibitor-treated cells relative to ApppN-capped reporter RNAs containing the beta-globin 3\u2032UTR, the poly(A) tail, or both (data not shown).",

It is clear that the interaction of the DENV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs stimulates translation; when eIF4E is present, translation initiation presumably occurs through a classical cap-dependent scanning mechanism. However, under conditions in which eIF4E or other cellular translation factors are limiting, such as in differentiated cell types with low levels of eIF4E (Grolleau et al., 1999, Krichevsky et al., 1999) or as a result of the IFN antiviral response (Gil et al., 1999), efficient viral translation requires both the DENV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs. This data suggests a model in which viral RNA that is translated in cellular conditions where eIF4E is limiting undergoes a reorganization of viral RNP complexes such that RNA structures or sequences in the 3\u2032UTR interact with higher affinity with protein complexes containing eIF4G and eIF4A. This would result in effective delivery by the DENV 3\u2032UTR of key translation initiation factors to the DENV 5\u2032UTR, similar to the mechanism proposed for cap-independent translation of Luteovirus RNAs, such as the barley yellow dwarf virus genome (Guo et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Adding to the complexity of translational control, the 3\u2032UTRs of cellular and viral messages often contain regulatory elements that negatively modulate expression. Whereas the poly(A) tail is thought to stimulate translation, regulatory elements upstream of the poly(A) tail in the 3\u2032UTR may maintain viral RNA in an inactive state via binding of repressor proteins (Fu et al., 1999, Tadauchi et al., 2001). One reason for this level of control may involve the switch from translation to RNA synthesis that must occur in positive-stranded RNA viruses, which are unable to replicate RNA templates undergoing translation due to the collision of translation and replication complexes proceeding in opposite directions. For picornaviruses, the alternate binding of the cellular factor PCBP or the viral protein 3CD to certain viral RNA structures has been shown to control the function of the genomic RNA in translation versus RNA synthesis (Barton et al., 1999, Gamarnik and Andino, 1997, Gamarnik and Andino, 1998). Additionally, both the 5\u2032 and the 3\u2032 termini of the pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) RNA genome have been shown to associate specifically with the \u2018NFAR\u2019 protein group (Isken et al., 2003). This interaction appears to be important for efficient translation termination and RNA replication and may function to regulate the switch between the two viral states (Isken et al., 2004).",

The 5\u2032CS, which comprises an 11-nt region \u223c35 nt downstream of the 5\u2032 end of the capsid gene, and its complementary 3\u2032CS sequence located \u223c100 nt from the end of the 3\u2032UTR are the most conserved linear sequences in the flavivirus genome. Recently, additional regions of complementarity between the DENV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs have been identified and named UAR (for upstream AUG region); the 5\u2032 sequence is 16 nt long and is located immediately upstream of the initiation codon while the 17 nt 3\u2032UAR is found in the stem of the 3\u2032SL (Alvarez et al., 2005b). Similar to the model for alphaviruses and bunyaviruses (Hsu et al., 1974, Talmon et al., 1987), it is hypothesized that base-pairing between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, which circularizes the genome, ensures the synthesis of full-length genomic RNAs (Hahn et al., 1987). In fact, visualization of individual DENV viral RNA molecules by atomic force microscopy confirmed that cyclization of the viral genome is a direct result of the physical interaction of the CS and UARs (Alvarez et al., 2005b). Moreover, this circularization appears to be necessary for flavivirus replication; mutation of the CS or UAR sequences in infectious DENV RNA resulted in a lethal phenotype in mammalian cells (Alvarez et al., 2005b, Men et al., 1996). Similarly, PMOs targeted to the 3\u2032CS of a DENV or WNV replicon suppressed RNA replication specifically (Deas et al., 2005, Holden et al., in press). The flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) also appears to require CS base-pairing for RNA synthesis both in vitro and in vivo (Khromykh et al., 2001, You and Padmanabhan, 1999), whereas the precise role of the UAR sequences in RNA synthesis remains to be determined. Together, these data underscore the importance of the interaction between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs in the viral lifecycle.",

To measure the influence of the CS on DENV translation, reporter constructs containing the DENV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs in the presence or absence of the first 72 nt of the capsid protein, which includes the 5\u2032CS, were generated (Fig. 2A). Luc activity measured from cells transfected with either of these RNA constructs demonstrated similar translation efficiencies (Fig. 5\n), indicating that DENV was translated independently of the interaction of the CS. These results are consistent with recent reports demonstrating that hybridization of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032CS in the context of either DENV reporter constructs or DENV replicons is not necessary for translation, and may even inhibit translation (Alvarez et al., 2005a, Chiu et al., 2005). However, the role of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 end interaction in enhancing viral translation combined with the requirement for CS base-pairing for RNA synthesis suggests the existence of alternative conformations of the flavivirus CS and UTRs for distinct viral functions. Like the picornavirus genome, the flavivirus genomic RNA is the template for multiple stages of the viral lifecycle that cannot occur simultaneously on the same RNA. Regulation of these stages depends on the communication of the viral UTRs. During replication, base-pairing of the CS appears to be necessary for viral RNA synthesis. However, this same interaction may inhibit translation of the RNA. We speculate that the switch between translation and replication of the flavivirus genome is mediated by the architectural remodeling of portions of the genome from that of an RNA\u2013protein bridge between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs to RNA\u2013RNA interactions between the CS and possibly the UARs at the extreme ends of the viral genome (Fig. 6\n). In this model, the switch between translation and replication is presumably mediated by viral and/or cellular factors that facilitate communication between the viral UTRs.",
