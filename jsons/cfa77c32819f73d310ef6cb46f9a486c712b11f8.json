The organism was described in the early 1900s by Chagas, who suggested that it was a trypanosome [6] . After World War II, P. carinii was recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in malnourished children. With the advent of organ transplantation and the attendant use of immunosuppressive agents, the pathogen again emerged as a significant problem. Drugs were developed to treat P. carinii pneumonia in the 1970s, but these agents have proved to be less effective in managing the disease in patients with AIDS, and most eventually perish from a P.carinii infection [33] .",

In the absence of solid biochemical and genetic data, many basic questions remained unanswered. One such question was the delineation of the proper phylogenetic associations of P. carinii. Prior to 1988, classification of P. carinii was based primarily on morphology, ultrastructure, growth requirements and susceptibility or resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Based on these fairly weak criteria, P. carinii was widely considered to be a protozoan, although some investigators had argued that P. carinii was more similar to the fungi than to the protozoa [31]. The first molecular genetic evidence bearing on the taxonomy of P. carinii was at odds with the prevailing notion. Three groups found that the sequences of P. carinii ribosomal RNAs and ribosomal RNA genes were much more similar to those of fungi than to those of any known protozoan [16, 29, 34] . Over the last 3 years, data have accumulated that support the idea that Pneumocystis is a fungus. However, it is clear that this parasitic fungus is not typical of the fungi most often isolated and studied in either the basic or clinical laboratory.",

The conservation of this bifunctional protein in these two protozoa is striking because Leishmania and Plasmodium are not close relatives.

P-type cation-translocation ATPases are enzymes that serve to pump cations across cellular membranes. The genes that encode P-type cation-translocation ATPases are found in diverse eucaryotes as well as in selected prokaryotes. All P-type ATPases share certain structural characteristics, but fungal proton-pumping ATPases appear to share at least one domain not found in other P-type ATPases. A P-type ATPase gene isolated from P. carinii has been found to contain this fungal-protonpump domain (Stringer et al., Abstract $22.3, 11th Congress of ISHAM, Montreal, Canada, June [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] 1991) .

It is not possible to resolve this paradox at this point. On the one hand, the 16s-like data are attractive because these RNA species are large enough to include regions that are highly conserved, regions that are highly divergent and regions that are moderately divergent. This range of variation facilitates detection of distant relatives as well as discrimination between very close relatives. Unfortunately, relatively few fungal 16s-like rRNAs have been sequenced and we know of no published data on species from the Rhizopoda, Myxomycota and Zygomycota. By contrast, the 5s rRNA sequence data base is very large, including many fungal species. However, 5s rRNAs are quite short and are very highly conserved, and this limits their utility as a phylogenetic index.",

P. carinii was originally defined by the histopathology of Pneumocystis pneumonia, and parasites displaying these histopathological characteristics, although from diverse mammalian hosts, are currently all classed under this rubric. Antigenic variability has been observed among Pneumocystis, but the basis for these differences is not clear. Recently, genetic variability among organisms classified as P. carinii on the basis of histopathology has been detected by pulsed field electrophoresis. Several laboratories have applied pulsed field electrophoresis to derive electrophoretic karyotypes for Pneumocystis isolated from experimentally infected rats [18, 21, 35] . A common finding was that P. carinii populations isolated from different colonies of infected rats each displayed a distinct electrophoretic karyotype. In one study [18] , electrophoretic karyotypes were found to be stable for over a year. While each karyotype was different, the number and size range of the chromosomes was usually similar. From the electrophoretic band patterns, the genome of Pneumocystis has been estimated to contain approximately 1 \u00d7 107 basepairs. The genome is not comprised entirely of unique sequences.

Although the trophic form may form a tight interdigitation with the Type I pneumocyte, the precise mechanism of this attachment is as yet unknown.

To assess reactivation of latent organisms as a cause of infection, viral-antibody-positive rats were received into facilities in filtered containers and placed immediately under barrier. Immunosuppression began after 7-10 days of acclimatization. After 8-10 weeks of immunosuppression, all rats had Pneumocystis pneumonia. Thus, reactivation of latent organisms can cause infection. Electrophoretic karyotypes obtained from these rats showed patterns specific to each rat strain. Whether this is a function of strain specificity, or infection by an isolate that has established itself within a given room is not yet known.",

T. Cushion et al., unpublished data). The presence or absence of antibodies to the organism did not appear to influence the infection in any way. Rat corona virus was positively associated with the infection in one rat strain, but its absence in other rat strains did not appear to affect the occurrence or severity of infection. However, when an attempt was made to establish a mixed infection by exposure of two different viral-antibody-positive rat strains harboring two distinct Pneumocystis karyotypes, the majority of the rats which were antibody positive to a single virus died as a result of exposure to the other rat strain which was reactive to several viruses. Death was independent of Pneumocystis infection.",

We do not know how many species of P. carinii exist in humans, or in animals, or whether animals harbor P. carinii that can infect humans. Airborne forms of the organism seem to exist, at least in rooms containing colonies of infected rats, but it is not clear whether or not people are exposed to the pathogen under ordinary circumstances. We know little about how P. carinii infections are transmitted and established, nor do we know the extent to which P. carinii maintains itself in asymptomatic subjects or about the factors needed to convert from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections. Host defenses against P. carinii are thought to involve macrophages and T-cells, but the role of other arms of the immune system has not been well studied. Both animal models of P. carinii infection and in vitro propagation will need to be improved in order to increase the pace of research into this important pathogen. Having gained the understanding that we are dealing with a fungus should help shape the direction of future investigations.",
