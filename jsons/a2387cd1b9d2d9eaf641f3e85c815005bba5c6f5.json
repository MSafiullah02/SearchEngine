Aim: To describe two consecutive yearly outbreaks of RSV in our haemato-oncology ward. Methods: Haematology patients presenting with respiratory symptoms were screened by polymerase chain reaction for viral respiratory pathogens using a saline gargle. Findings: None of our patients had undergone bone marrow transplant but all had underlying haematological malignancies. Eight patients were affected in the first outbreak (mortality rate: 37.5%) and 12 patients were affected in the second (mortality rate: 8.3%). Extensive infection control measures were implemented in both outbreaks and were successful in preventing further cross-transmission. Conclusion: There was significant learning from both outbreaks and actions implemented with the aim of reducing the likelihood and impact of future outbreaks.",

All patients in both outbreaks had underlying haematological malignancies but none had had autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplants. The outbreaks coincided with seasonal outbreaks of RSV in the community and increased admissions in the paediatric setting. From timelines that were created, and particularly during the December 2016 outbreak, there were opportunities for crosstransmission between patients in the same bed bays. However, this did not explain the full picture, as some RSVpositive patients had no contact with other positive cases (Figures 1 and 2 ). Our hypothesis for both outbreaks is that RSV was introduced from the community by a patient, a staff member or a relative and cross-transmission then occurred in the ward setting between patients themselves, and staff members with mild symptoms. This appeared to be the case in the first outbreak where the index case was admitted symptomatic from the community. This pattern has been demonstrated in other RSV outbreaks. Jensen et al. described an RSV outbreak in haematology patients involving 12 patients and one staff member. Sequencing of the isolates was consistent with transmission occurring on the ward and introduction of RSV from the community [5] . In a 2011e12 outbreak involving 57 haematology patients, investigations showed single introduction of the outbreak strain from the community; this strain subsequent spread among patients into the unit [6] .",

Viral shedding in this patient group is known to occur for several weeks after the resolution of symptoms, and has been reported to be seven to 84 days in one study [7] . In both outbreaks we detected asymptomatic patients on screening. We also noted patients who continued to be PCR positive following resolution of symptoms and who became positive again after having negative PCR results. Both outbreaks were relatively short, so it was not possible to determine for how long patients were continuing to excrete the virus. Whether these patients could shed virus in sufficient amounts to contribute to further transmission is unknown. Outbreak investigators in the paediatric setting have detected asymptomatic patients and have postulated that these patients may shed RSV and cause onward transmission [8, 9] . Due to our high-risk population we employed patient screening to detect those who were asymptomatic in both outbreaks. Further research investigating the efficacy of this measure is required. During a large outbreak of RSV in a German haematology unit, 20% of RSV patients had recurrent positive tests even after two consecutive negative PCR tests. This led the authors to conclude that it might be appropriate to treat patients as positive for their duration of stay [2] .",

Average age in this outbreak was also higher at 64 years, which might have been a factor in the mortality rate. A retrospective cohort study of 227 adult patients attending the emergency department with RSV identified lower respiratory infection, chronic lung disease and bacterial co-infection as independent predictors of life-threatening infection [10] . Risk factor analysis specific to haematology patients is difficult due to small numbers but sharing a room with a positive patient was identified as a risk factor from one study [2] . One of the larger studies examining risk factors involved 56 haematology patients. Hypogammaglobulinaemia was identified as a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality and was not reversible by treatment with polyvalent immunoglobulin [11] . Preexisting lung disease was also thought to be a factor but the finding was not statistically significant [11] . In 181 haematopoietic cell transplant recipients with RSV, lymphopenia was associated with progression to lower respiratory disease [12] . The majority of our patients in both outbreaks were noted to be lymphopenic (Table I) although this is not a rare finding in this patient population.",

The implementation of broad precautions applicable to the entire unit is recommended during RSV outbreaks in preference to those focusing only on specific patients [1] . A recent systematic review of control measures implemented in 40 RSV outbreaks supported the use of multi-component measures. These measures reduced the transmission risk by 50%.

Two were positive, both of whom were displaying symptoms. Staff screening was not performed in the second outbreak. Fewer staff were symptomatic and our experience from the outbreak the preceding year was that only the symptomatic staff tested positive. Similarly, in an outbreak of RSV in adult stem cell recipients 99 asymptomatic healthcare workers were screened and all tested negative [1] . Had the outbreak control measures failed we would have proceeded with staff screening in 2016. During both outbreaks healthcare workers with mild symptoms remained at work and this has been described by others [1] . Human resource policies in relation to sickness absence and concerns about ward staffing may mean that staff are reluctant to take time off when symptoms are mild. When caring for RSVpositive patients our staff wore surgical masks. Implementation of a universal surgical mask policy, whereby all staff in direct contact with patients wore a mask, led to a significant reduction in respiratory viral illness in a haemopoeitic stem cell unit [14] .",

Prophylactic administration of palivizumab was administered during a nosocomial outbreak involving five stem cell transplant patients in 2010. Sixteen patient contacts were designated high risk and administered prophylaxis with intravenous palivizumab, none of whom went on to develop RSV [15] . Further studies into the benefits of prophylaxis in this patient group are needed. Given that the last outbreak of RSV in haematology patients in our health board was in 1999 we were surprised to experience two significant outbreaks two years in succession. Although both outbreaks were relatively short-lived there was significant morbidity, mortality and disruption to our haematology service. A review of both outbreaks has been undertaken and a number of measures implemented as a result. RSV is highly transmissible and rapid detection in this susceptible patient group is essential. We are limited by accommodation with only five single rooms; in addition our virology laboratory is situated off site. Near-patient testing done at ward level for RSV and other respiratory viruses has now been implemented. This will enable prompt detection and isolation or cohorting, depending on results. Human resources have agreed that staff members who are excluded during a confirmed outbreak will not have the sickness absence recorded e it is hoped that this will encourage staff members to refrain from duty when symptomatic. An early warning trigger has been implemented to inform the ward and infection control team when RSV cases in the community start to increase. Consideration is to be given to admitting haematology patients to other areas when presenting with respiratory symptoms, provided specialist haematology care is not required. Our board RSV policy was reviewed and now includes specific information relevant to RSV outbreaks in adults; the previous emphasis had been on the paediatric setting where outbreaks are more frequent. A report was produced following each outbreak and provided summary information as well as recommendations including: staff education, local audits of hand hygiene, and standard infection control precautions. A full staff debrief was undertaken after the first outbreak as there was naturally staff anxiety both in relation to patient outcomes and as to whether staff had been implicated in the outbreak.",
