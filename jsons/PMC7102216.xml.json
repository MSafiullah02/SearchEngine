Immunologically, B lymphocytes generate auto-reactive antibodies to nuclear antigens, and modulate the T-cell repertoire through cytokine production and antigen presentation [1]. Pathologically, inflammation and immune complex deposition results in end-organ damage. Thus, targeting aberrant B cells is a promising approach in a disease where new treatments are long-awaited (none have been validated in the last 30\u201340 years); current therapeutic options can carry serious adverse effects (e.g. ovarian failure and opportunistic infections with cyclophosphamide), and significant numbers of patients fail to respond [2].",

Regarding antibody levels following rituximab, studies are divided. For example, Looney et al found no change in double-stranded DNA antibodies, levels at baseline being 2.40 \u00b1 0.74 and at 3 months 2.35 \u00b10.67 (mean \u00b1 SD log titre) [13]. In contrast, Lu et al found ds-DNA antibodies fell from a median of 106 to 42 IU/ml at 6 months (p < 0.001) [24]. This might be explained by variable measurement techniques or the time-point at which levels are measured post-rituximab, with assessments at less than 6 months generally demonstrating no significant change. This is supported by papers with repeat measurements, Lindholm found ds-DNA antibodies at baseline of 34.5 \u00b1 4.9 U/ml, to 27.3 \u00b1 5.3 at 6 months (p = 0.038), and 16.3 \u00b1 3.9 after 12 months (p = 0.0049) [25].",

One possible explanation of the negative findings lies in the methodology, with considerable background immunosuppression clouding any measurable difference between the rituximab and placebo groups. Another potential design feature of the EXPLORER trial which may have negated the effects of rituximab was the timing of retreatment. As mentioned previously, there is evidence that B cell repopulation contributes to the immune system changes; removing the reconstituted B cell pool with a 6-month re-treatment may diminish the benefit.",

Two issues transpire with the development of HACA; firstly, they are a potential barrier to continued drug effectiveness, although successful B cell depletion and induction of remission occur despite HACA; secondly, they increase the risk of infusion reactions or serum-sickness, which occur more commonly with both repeat rituximab dosing and HACA development [31, 32].

Interestingly, a recent RCT found that the addition of cyclophosphamide to rituximab conferred no additional clinical, histological or laboratory benefit in lupus nephritis [46].

Breaking response down by disease manifestations suggests that some show better response rates to rituximab than others, for example cutaneous lesions/discoid lupus shows less improvement than neuropsychiatric or renal, and multi-system disease is more responsive than single organ [32]. Off-license, studies have inevitably included patients with severe refractory lupus, so any positive outcomes should be viewed favourably; however, the degree of severity and refractoriness is variable between the studies (e.g. baseline mean SLEDAI score varying from 8 to 24) [35, 49], and this will effect response rates. Similarly, variable regimens of rituximab and concurrent immunosuppressives complicate validation of efficacy.",

For example, in lupus nephritis, abridging the outcome response to strictly defined \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cpartial remission\u201d is too reductionist an approach, and too few studies have assessed the histological changes.

If evidence continues to accumulate in favour of rituximab, future consideration may be given to a combination approach with belimumab or epratuzumab, as the mechanisms of action of each are dissimilar. Furthermore, BLyS levels are inversely proportional to B-cell load, suggesting anti-BLyS may improve clinical response [52].
