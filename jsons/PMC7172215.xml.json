            "text": "Acute viral respiratory infections (VRIs) encompass a range of illnesses that together constitute the most frequent infections of humans. The most prevalent syndrome is that characterized by signs and symptoms of the common cold, or acute viral rhinosinusitis. These illnesses are typically acute, self-limiting events associated primarily with upper respiratory symptoms, but they also cause symptoms that are indicative of lower respiratory involvement, particularly in the very young, the elderly, and those with preexisting airways disease.1, 2, 3 Rhinoviruses are the most common pathogen causing VRIs and account for approximately 50% of colds on an annual basis. Not surprisingly, the recent development of antiviral compounds with activity targeted against rhinoviruses has intensified interest in these infections. This supplement contains a series of articles based on presentations by internationally regarded experts who met on April 3 and 4, 2001 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to discuss current knowledge and recent advances regarding the epidemiology, clinical impact, pathogenesis, and management of rhinoviral VRIs.",

These studies have confirmed rhinoviruses as the cause of a majority of common colds, particularly when advanced techniques have been applied, such as viral RNA detection by reverse-transcription PCR testing. They also have reported the year-round occurrence of rhinovirus illness, with peaks in the fall and spring in temperate climates, and have highlighted the importance of children in introducing infections into the household.

Rhinovirus infection is efficient, and the infectious dose is quite small in the immunologically susceptible host. Furthermore, symptoms develop rapidly, within 16 hours of infection under experimental conditions, and are related to virally induced host responses, including the release of inflammatory mediators and neurogenic reflexes. Knowledge of the pathogenesis is important in the timing of any therapeutic approach. These findings highlight the importance of antiviral therapy to address the primary cause of illness and of early intervention, within the first day of symptom onset, in order to reduce viral replication promptly.",

Dr. Gern reviews several studies demonstrating the contribution of the host immune response to rhinovirus illness and the association between rhinovirus infection and exacerbations in individuals with established asthma. In the experimental setting, increased colds severity is associated with increased airway reactivity as measured by objective tests. The mechanisms by which a mucosal viral infection elicits systemic immune responses and contributes to exacerbations are areas of active investigation. This complex interaction is incompletely understood at present; important questions must be answered regarding the frequency and extent of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, and the host inflammatory responses to infection need to be more completely characterized.",

Greenberg reviews this topic in the fourth article and discusses the findings of a prospective observational study in older ambulatory adults with or without COPD who were monitored over several years. The impact of rhinovirus infection in these populations was substantial. Dr. Greenberg\u2019s study found that picornaviruses, 75% of which were identified as rhinoviruses, were the most common pathogen found, followed by parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses. Influenza was less common because of the high immunization rate in the populations studied. VRIs in the patients with COPD were associated with 2-fold higher health-care utilization rates including hospitalizations. Furthermore, as the population of the United States ages, the burden of disease will increase with respect to medical care resource utilization. One approach to decreasing the disease burden is development of a vaccine. Because more than 100 rhinovirus serotypes exist, however, this task is impractical. Given the low likelihood of an effective vaccine for rhinovirus infections, effective antiviral medications might prove beneficial in reducing this burden. Intervention studies targeting these populations are needed.",

Although all of the candidate antirhinoviral agents are currently investigational, the studies to date have established the potential for prevention and early treatment of rhinovirus infections by selective antiviral agents.23\n",
