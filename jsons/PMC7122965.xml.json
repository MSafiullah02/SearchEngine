The communications among humans and machines in the eyes of Norbert Wiener in 1950s were generally assumed as point-to-point or neglected as regularly structured in the scope of classic graph theory [2, 3]. Afterwards, Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi extended the graph description with uncertainty and randomness, and proposed the random graph theory in 1960s [4]. In the following decades the flourishing information and communication techniques have pushed the whole human society to a networking village of today, while the understanding of dominant yet hidden connectivity patterns of the communications among humans and machines were not revisited until recently.",

Typically, from the viewpoint of system and control, the precise mathematic description and appropriate models of a complex network play a significant role to achieve the desirable performance in return.

Academia has witnessed that prediction and control of epidemic dynamics in networks as a flourishing research topic with interdisciplinary approaches [17\u201320]. However, more challenging problems arising from the epidemic prevalence on a meta-population network have not received adequate attentions, such as identifying the parameters of epidemic network systems and the epidemic invasion pathways on a meta-population network, which, ignored previously, certainly play important roles in evaluating the intensity of outbreak of epidemics among human patches/populations.",

Maeno [26] inferred the epidemic network between eleven countries and areas during SARS in 2003 by analysing the epidemic time series. Reference [27] extracted the most likely epidemic transmission trees of the 1918 influenza pandemic in England, Wales and the United States. Some methods based on machine learning were also proposed to infer the epidemic networks from surveillance data [28\u201330]. Gautreau et al. presented a measure of the average arrival time to characterize the minimum-distance path from subpopulation i to subpopulation j over all possible paths [31], and the average arrival time-based shortest path tree is constructed by assembling all the shortest paths from the seed subpopulation to any other subpopulation in a networked meta-population. Balcan et al. proposed a Monte Carlo maximum likelihood method to produce a most likely infection tree [32]. They constructed the minimum spanning tree from the seed subpopulation to minimize the distance. Recently, Brockmann and Helbing [15] proposed a new concept called \u201ceffective distance\u201d to predict the disease arrival time. From node/location i to node/location j, the effective distance D\nij is defined as the minimum sum of effective lengths over all reachable branches along this path. The set of shortest paths to all other nodes from seed node i constitutes a shortest path tree, illustrating the most probable paths from the root to other nodes. On the other hand, approaches based on machine learning such as genetic algorithm [28\u201330] has been used to extract epidemic transmission networks.",

In fact, these two concepts are a bit different, and very few work has discussed the parameter identification of a meta-population network system. Here a natural problem poses itself that whether the parameters and epidemic invasion process can be identified from the infection data of populations and network topology? To get a better understanding of how the contagion diffuses via an invasion process on network, more topics deserve further efforts: (i) So far, there are few works on identification of parameters of a meta-population network which an epidemic is occurring on. New questions such as the following ones are raised: How to use the data from the limited epidemic realizations to infer the system parameters as accurate as possible? Does a more appropriate model of individual mobility exist? (ii) Identification of spatial invasion pathways is to uncover the channels by which the hosts transmit viruses in a spatially structured population with the infection data. In a large-scale meta-population network, the complex pattern of pathways challenges the methodology to identify the epidemic invasion pathways in a meta-population network.",

The remainder of this chapter is arranged as follows. Section 6.2 gives the detailed description of preliminaries. Section 6.3 introduces the parameter identification of epidemic models on a meta-population network. Section 6.4 contributes the inference of epidemic invasion pathways in a meta-population network with both methodologically and example verifications. In Sect. 6.5, extending the steps of the previous sections, the prediction of spatial epidemic transmission comes with several feasible methods.

In such a population, the states of individuals are stratified into two compartments (classes): susceptible to the infection of the pathogen; and infected by the pathogen. Generally, we assume that all individuals are homogenously mixing in the population. The state transition of an individual between two compartments is governed by the following reaction process: When a susceptible individual meets (i.e., has the contacts) with an infected individual in a unit time, the susceptible individual will be infected with an infection rate \u03b2.\n",

Besides, we also make the comparison of the identification accuracy at the early stage of epidemic dynamics, which is defined as the period when the first 50 subpopulation have been infected. In the top and middle panels of Fig. 6.8, we observe the whole identification accuracy and the early-stage identification accuracy, while the bottom panel of Fig. 6.8 presents the early and whole accumulative identification accuracy of mI \u21a6 S and mI \u21a6 nS through 20 independent realizations on the AAN, respectively. Here the whole identification accuracy means the identification accuracy of whole meta-population network has been infected. The seed subpopulation in all such independent realizations is set as the Sun Valley Airport in Bullhead City, Arizona. We clearly observe that the IPI algorithm is more accurate at identifying the invasion pathways than other benchmark methods.\n",

Figure 6.10 shows the entropy and identifiability of wrongly identified mI \u21a6 S of 20 independent realizations on the AAN. The smaller the identifiability of an invasion case is, the more prone it is to be wrongly identified. The identifiability depicts the wrongly identified mI \u21a6 S more reasonably than the likelihoods entropy. The frequency of identifiability of INCs descends obviously, but that of the likelihood entropy of INCs does not clearly ascend. This statistical result indicates that the identifiability \u03a0 has a better performance to distinguish whether an invasion case is difficult to identify or not than the distinction performance of the likelihood entropy, and also tells that why some invasion cases are easy to identify, whose \u03a0 are more than 0.5, and why some invasion cases are difficult to identify, whose \u03a0 are much less than 0.5. Here 0.5 is an empirical value.\n\n",

The future steps along this line may involve the following aspects: (1) The adaptiveness of humans deserves sufficient respect when facing the modelling, analyses and prediction of a large-scale spatial pandemic situation, and an appropriately designed role with the feedback-loop of human adaptiveness into such a complex networking system will be much appreciated. (2) The power of Big Data and cloud computing may help embed high-resolution records of human behavioural dynamics (including mobility, interaction and other non-private profiles) into the study. Nevertheless, abuse of data should be carefully avoided. (3) The verification even for the prediction of an infectious process requires the precise control means and public strategy in the viewpoints of not only mathematical results but also implementations in practice. Finally comes the end of this chapter, which may still stands at the beginning of the long journey in this exciting and challenging direction.",
