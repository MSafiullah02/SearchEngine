It is highly virulent, having spread to Iran, Europe, and eventually North America, causing an unprecedented global crisis. Hospitals have filled rapidly with patients with COVID-19 requiring treatment, thereby imposing a strain on healthcare staffing needs and the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). The strain on resources has forced hospitals to implement unprecedented changes, such as cancellation of elective operations and non-essential clinic visits. Surgical training has also been significantly impacted by these changes in healthcare, and surgery residents have been deployed to other services and units to provide much needed care. In addition to changes to daily life, such as social distancing, surgeons and surgical trainees have been forced to evaluate many elements of their clinical practice and surgical training, respectively.",

Other modes of spread for viruses include aerosols, membrane-to-membrane, fecal-oral, and fomite spread; the relative role of each of those modes as related to COVID-19 is still being determined. SARS-CoV-2 viral aerosols generated using a nebulizer have been found to be viable for up to 3 h. On surfaces, the virus is viable for 4 h on copper, 24 h on cardboard, and 72 h on stainless steel and plastic.1 Clinically, upon contracting COVID-19, it takes on average 3 days before a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is able to detect the virus, at which point an infected person is contagious. The average time is 5 days of infection before an individual begins to become mildly symptomatic, although it can be as long as 14 days. The symptoms include fevers in 83\u201398% of patients, cough in 46\u201382% of patients, and myalgias in 11\u201344% of patients.2 Of all patients in \u201cmild\u201d symptom phase, up to 20% will progress to requiring hospitalization at an average of 8\u20139 days after symptom onset. Of hospitalized patients, 20\u201330% will eventually develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and further intensive care unit support. Approximately 1\u20138% of patients eventually succumb to their disease, primarily from oxygen deprivation or cardiomyopathy, approximately 3 weeks following infection (Fig. 1).",

There is no current or prior experience with COVID-19, but if it behaves like the previously known coronavirus strains that cause common cold symptoms, there may be an abatement in disease prevalence during spring and summer seasons.3 As such, a second peak in the fall, as was previously observed with Spanish influenza, is possible. After the current pandemic, it is still unknown if COVID-19 will become endemic (persist at a lower level), will become a seasonal virus (likely spreading between hemispheres), or will be controlled and eliminated by medicines and/or a vaccine.",

An operational challenge is the variation in degree of shortages by region and present inability to pair supply with demand. This challenge subsequently led to a strain on healthcare personnel, who are now being redeployed to new specialties and departments beyond their expertise for critical shortage cover, all while battling anxiety from poorly defined exposure to patients with COVID-19 and subsequent transmission to themselves and their families and friends.",

While undetectable in blood and urine, viral particles can be detected in sputum, upper airway tracts, and feces for at least 14 days after onset of symptoms. Surgeons have to constantly balance patient needs against contagion risk from aerosol-generating procedures such as endoscopy, bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, bowel resection, and lung resections, among others. This balance may be accentuated with laparoscopic surgery if additional measures that prevent further aerosolization of viral particles are not taken. The concern originally stems from historic data with hepatitis where active virus could be detected in smoke plumes from electrocautery within evacuated carbon dioxide.4, 5 While surgeons should take every precaution to minimize any potential risk of transmission to themselves or staff, it is important to recognize that there is no COVID-19-specific data that aerosolized virus in cauterized plumes or laparoscopic gases is present let alone viable or transmissible. Among best practices for laparoscopy that should be implemented in COVID-19 unknown patients include:Low pressure pneumoperitoneum\u2014use the minimum pressure that allows safe conduct of the operation, 10\u201312 mm/Hg is usually sufficientSealing all trocar/port valves except those used for insufflation and smoke evacuation.Use of an active smoke evacuation system with in line or receptacle filter.Evacuating carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum through a 0.1-\u03bcm filtered filter prior to trocar removal/specimen extraction.",

In keeping with recommendations provided by the American College of Surgeons (ACS), a decision has been made at many institutions to postpone elective operations. The primary drivers for this policy include a need to manage PPE supply, but most importantly, to manage staff and resource supply. There is also some preliminary evidence from experience in other countries that active COVID-19 infection may be associated with increased risk of postoperative complications. In order to account for urgent, emergent, and even cancer and transplant operations, a definition of \u201celective\u201d that has been proposed includes any operation that can be deferred for up to 3 months without compromising outcomes \u2013 although definitions have varied considerably.6 Additional guidelines have been provided on a national level by numerous societies to better aid surgeons in triaging operations in months to come.6\u20139",

The Academy will be evaluating and posting helpful materials and documents on the Academy\u2019s website in the coming weeks and disseminating these resources through regular communications. The second area of focus is the spectrum of novel teaching and assessment methods and innovative educational approaches that are being used successfully across various institutions. Review of these resources should help foster even greater innovation in surgical training. Use of new technologies has permitted institutions to conduct major teaching conferences virtually. The early successes with these virtual methods may result in the adoption of such methods in the long term, even after the COVID-19 pandemic comes under control. The ACS Division of Education is also pursuing new and innovative simulation-based training methods to support the efforts of surgical educators and surgical trainees. Dialogue is underway with simulation and technology companies to share emerging training needs so that these companies may help in addressing these needs through development of new tools. The Academy will continue to collect vital resources and share them with the larger surgical community and will support the development and implementation of new training methods. The third area of focus is to administer scientifically validated surveys to various institutions, surgery departments, surgical trainees, and constituent groups involved with surgery residency training to collect, analyze, and disseminate information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the short and the longer term. All three areas of focus will address residents\u2019 well-being and propose strategies to support surgery residents during this difficult period. The Academy will also focus on the phase beyond the current pandemic to harness opportunities involved with the reassimilation of residents into the surgical environments. The experiences with surgery residency training during the COVID-19 pandemic should help in preparing surgery departments and institutions for future crises and emergencies and chart a new course for surgery residency training.",
