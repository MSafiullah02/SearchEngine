There are often interesting changes, developments, controversies and problems that occur in the Region that go unappreciated\u2014and often unnoticed\u2014by others in this region. The Editors\u2010in\u2010Chief felt that this presented an opportunity to get to know more about our Region whilst providing some entertaining reading.Alistair Cooke was a journalist who wrote a regular letter to the BBC called \u2018Letter from America\u2019. In the letter, he outlined events, developments, foibles, problems and opportunities that characterized the era, much as we would write to a family member telling them the news of the day. The \u2018Letter\u2019 was very popular and many of us would have been informed and entertained by this broadcast in years gone by. The model illustrates the intent of a new section in Respirology called \u2018Letter from Asia\u2010Pacific Region\u2019. Our invited authors will cover stimulating topics of current importance in their country, whether it be clinical problems, research initiatives, medical\u2010political developments, disease trends or simply unusual anecdotal experiences or observations.It is our hope that our readers will enjoy the \u2018Letter\u2019, look forward to reading it and ultimately offer to contribute and help to inform us of what is happening in their \u2018backyard\u2019. Correspondence and opinions about the \u2018Letter\u2019 are welcomed.\n",

Several aspects pertinent to the field of respiratory medicine, and the prospects for respiratory research are highlighted here.2, 3\n",

            "text": "Despite the falling rates of tobacco smoking (~10%), lung cancer remains the top cancer killer in HK. In particular, about 60% of newly diagnosed non\u2010small lung cancer cases are driven by targetable mutations in oncogenes such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Molecular profiling requiring tissue samples is increasingly pivotal to allow for a personalized approach in treatment, which helps to drive the momentum for advances in respiratory diagnostic and interventional pulmonology. The large proportion of EGFR\u2010mutated or ALK\u2010rearranged lung cancers makes HK one of the pioneers in the clinical utilization of cutting\u2010edge targeted therapies, providing a leading role in many landmark studies in this area. Investigations of mechanisms in carcinogenesis and alternations in genetic expression and intracellular proteomics, involving in vitro and mice xenograft models, have shed light on the potential clinical effects of novel targeted therapy. The detection of plasma EGFR mutation in lung cancer implies worse prognosis. Clinical studies on outcomes of lung cancer in the elderly, and therapeutics of lymphoepithelioma\u2010like carcinoma (LELC) peculiar to Asians have contributed to the knowledge and thus improved care. Increasing attention is made to the early detection of lung cancer, pre\u2010cancerous conditions and cancer prevention. Symptom palliation has also been the focus of cancer research, including the use of indwelling pleural catheters. The urgent need for data informing the optimal approach to malignant pleural effusion will pave the way for research in pleural diseases.",

OSA has also been found to be common among children, elderly, occupational drivers and diabetic subjects. Various strategies have then been investigated to facilitate the diagnosis of OSA, including craniofacial features, questionnaires and portable sleep diagnostics. A decade of effort has uncovered a number of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic complications associated with OSA, which could be amenable to positive airway pressure treatment. Mechanistic links pivotal to these cardiometabolic consequences and the associated alterations in various serum biomarkers are also studied extensively, both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, various modalities of treatment effective for control of OSA, other than fixed pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), are also investigated and compared to strive for better patient compliance and outcomes. With the solid foundation established so far, it is expected that OSA research will continue to prosper in coming decades.",

Asthma has been the focus of many collaborative works which inform on the clinical assessment, natural course and risk factors, with the aim to detect suboptimal asthma control and early intervention. In addition to air pollution, various infectious and non\u2010infectious aetiologies are also recognized as causing acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Surrogate markers in exhaled breath condensate in COPD correlate with disease activity and severity, while BODE index (a composite index for COPD including Body\u2010mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise) is useful in predicting mortality and readmission. The role of early rehabilitation programmes in improving quality of life in AECOPD, as well as the adoption of comprehensive care programmes, would reduce hospitalizations. The effects of non\u2010invasive ventilation (NIV) in acute hypercapnic AECOPD, continuation at home after discharge and the weaning strategy for NIV in acute hypercapnic AECOPD have been investigated thoroughly. Non\u2010cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis, frequently the late sequela of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), dominates the microcosm of chronic suppurative airway diseases in HK. The clinical effects of inhaled fluticasone and low\u2010dose erythromycin in non\u2010CF bronchiectasis were explored early in the millennium.",

The accreditation of our TB laboratory by WHO and recognition by Center for disease control and prevention (CDC) as a potential worldwide chemotherapy research centre in 2006 has fuelled the research programme. The TB infection rate showed a clear downward trend in the last century; nevertheless, the slope levels off in recent years. In spite of the drastic improvement in all aspects of management of TB, we are still faced with the challenge of multidrug resistance, human immunodeficiency virus infection, widespread use of immunosuppressants and immigration. The high incidence rates of diabetes mellitus, renal impairment and chronic hepatitis B infection locally also put patients at risk of side effects from anti\u2010tuberculous regimens. TB as an important public health problem will continue to be loaded with research effort and resources, with the ultimate aim of TB eradication.4\n",
