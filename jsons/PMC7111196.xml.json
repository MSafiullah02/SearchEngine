The DNA sequences coding the S, E, and M proteins of SARS CoV were obtained from the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University (GenBank Accession No. AY291451). The coding sequences for the three structural proteins were cloned into a modified transfer plasmid derived from pBacPAK8 (Clontech), under the control of a strong viral promoter, polyhedrin promoter. This transfer plasmid also contains a red fluorescent reporter gene, DsRed2 (Clontech), driven by a heat-shock promoter. To generate recombinant baculoviruses using Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) viral genome, the individual plasmids containing S, E, and M proteins were co-transfected with linearized viral DNA (BaculoGold, BD Biosciences) by using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) into insect cells, successful recombinants were isolated by the indication of red fluorescence. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding the S, E, and M proteins, assigned as vABhRpS, vABhRpE, and vABhRpM, respectively, were obtained by two- or three-round serial dilutions, and all viral stocks were prepared and manipulated according to the standard protocol described by O\u2019Reilly et al.

The VLPs were observed in a large lightly stained vesicle (solid arrow). A higher magnification showed that several heavily stained smaller vesicles with VLPs were also found (open arrows) near the lightly stained vesicle. These lightly and darkly stained structures are similar to the electron microscopic studies of a specimen from SARS patient [21]. The distribution of VLPs in the baculovirus-insect cell system was also consistent with a previous study demonstrating the assembly of hepatitis C virus-like particles in insect cells [22]. In Figs. 1C and D, the cytoplasm of a cell is covered with VLPs, some of which are arbitrarily indicated by arrowheads. This result suggested that VLP-containing vesicles (open arrow in (B)) were disrupted and VLPs were released all over in the cytoplasm in some cells.",

Another possible application is to define the possible packaging signal of SARS CoV. The packaging signal of coronavirus RNA was previously identified by using defective interfering viral particles [26], since the SARS-CoV is a highly infectious virus, it would be much more feasible to identify this signal by using VLPs. Moreover, S protein-containing VLPs should be able to specifically target to the host cell of the SARS CoV and serve as a safe and efficient tool to deliver potential therapeutic agents (e.g., siRNA) for effective treatment of SARS in the future.",

After sucrose gradient centrifugation, 28 fractions were collected and their chromatograph was shown in (A). Fractionation was monitored with a wavelength of 280 nm; the dotted line represents weight percentage of sucrose. (B) Equal amounts of gradient fractions were separately resolved in 8% (anti-S) and 14% (anti-E) of polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western analyses. Numbers on the left sides of the sub-panels are the molecular weights of protein markers (M). Western analysis confirmed the presence of S and E proteins mainly in fractions 16\u201318.",
