            "text": "Nowadays, the coronavirus pandemic has and is still causing large numbers of deaths and infected people. Although governments all over the world have taken severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities, quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study [1] has reported that 79% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT 1 investigation system that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients. Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel virus has emerged in Wuhan city. This disease, named coronavirus or COVID-19, has quickly spread throughout China and then to the entire world. As of May 2020, more than 200 countries and territories have been affected and over 4 million people have been diagnosed with the virus. Since no cure or vaccine has been found and since tests cannot be applied on a large scale to millions of persons, governments had and still have no choice but to take severe actions such as border closing, travel canceling, curfews, quarantines, and contact precautions (facemasks, social distancing, and self-isolation). The authorities have also implemented strategies that aim to rapidly detect infections using different cutting-edge medical tools (such as thermal cameras, blood tests, nasal swabs, etc.). On the one hand, these measurements, which for the time being constitute the only possible solution, have succeeded to slow down the contagion spreading, but on the other hand, they have also caused considerable economic damages, especially to countries with brittle economies (suspension of all sorts of activities: social, economic, educational, etc.).",

            "text": "The rapid spreading of coronavirus is due to the continuous person-to-person transmission [2, 3, 4] . In addition to this, a recent study has also suggested that a second factor is playing a major causal role in this high virus spreading; namely the stealth transmission [1] . The coronavirus can take 14 days before the appearance of symptoms. During this incubation period, asymptomatic patients, called undocumented patients, can infect large communities of people. In turn, these newly infected persons, who will remain unaware of their illness (until they eventually develop the symptoms), can also infect larger communities, thus, leading to an uncontrollable domino effect [1, 5, 6] . Accordingly, to confine and effectively eliminate the coronavirus, it is crucial and mandatory to possess an efficient investigation system that allows determining (1) highly infectious places and (2) all the persons who were in contact with patients who have recently tested positive. Indeed, persons who are known to be in direct relationship with a patient (such as family members, friends, and coworkers) can be easily determined and tested. However, numerous other persons could have also been in contact with this infected individual. All these persons, who cannot be easily determined, can contribute to the widespread of the virus. To remedy this issue, in this paper, we propose an IoT investigation system that can determine the exact trajectories of infected persons (exact coordinates labeled with time). Hence, as shown in Figure 1 , the proposed solution allows determining areas of high contamination and also provides a quick detection mechanism of undocumented patients who are known to be the main and most important factor in the rapid widespread of coronavirus. These persons (resp. places) can be tested/confined even if they had no blatant symptoms (resp. closed and properly disinfected).",

Although this proposed solution can open large debates from the standpoint of privacy and human rights, during extreme critical situations in which the entire human race might be at stake, the urgency of saving lives becomes of higher priority. In such circumstances, the proposed technique can be quickly applied as a last resort by higher authorities (governments, WHO 2 , etc.) while giving guarantees about (1) protecting the privacy of people, and (2) disabling this system once the outbreak is contained.",

Also, the contacts between persons are not sufficient to estimate the coronavirus contact rates. This disease can be transmitted without direct contact with patients (e.g., touching an object previously used by an infected person). The determination of both sets SUSPECTED t and SUSPECT t helps to accurately estimate the contacts rate and to determine the set of Infectious but undetected (Iu) persons. In addition to this, our proposed investigation system can also help to determine the pandemic spatial distribution inside any monitored territory.
