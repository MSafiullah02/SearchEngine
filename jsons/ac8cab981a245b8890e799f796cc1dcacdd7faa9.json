As a result of the pandemic, medical healthcare providers are under an enormous amount of workload pressure along with increased total health expenditures. The overwhelming burden of COVID-19 illness could lead to caregiver burnout. The major causes of psychological distress among healthcare workers are including long work hours, sleep disturbances, debilitating fatigue, and the risk of getting infection and put their family at risk of a life-threatening condition. According to the China's National Health Commission, more than 3300 healthcare workers had been infected and at least 22 have died. Unfortunately, in Iran, at least 40 healthcare workers have died due to COVID-19 infection and dozens have reportedly been put under observation after experiencing signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Physicians' burnout and shortage of health care workforce has a serious consequences for patients and could cause medical system on the verge of a devastating collapse [3] .",

The most important aspect of being prepared is planning ahead. The concept of \"forward triage\" was designed for response to various types of crisis scenarios such as virus epidemics and catastrophes. Forward triage is the process of determining the patients' condition before they arrive in the emergency department. Direct-toconsumer telemedicine can enable patients to connect with their healthcare provider at a distance [4] . This virtual platform could be used by smartphones or webcam-enabled computers and allows physicians to effectively screen patients with early signs of COVID-19 before they reach to hospital. As a result, this could lead to a substantial decline in unnecessary patients visit, promoting self-quarantine and reducing emergency department overuse. Moreover, this approach provides remote monitoring of recently discharged patients, which is a crucial step in containing the outbreak. In addition, providing care from afar can help reduce the risk of clinicians' exposure to infections.",

This fact will emphasize another important aspect of using telemedicine which is the ability to reinforce those health care workers that have been quarantined at home after exposure to COVID-19 and employ quarantined physicians to communicate with patients remotely via computer. It should be noted that telemedicine cannot replace inperson patient care, but could benefit other frontline physicians by reducing their workload and optimizing their time to attending to patients being in a critically-ill condition.",

Many countries have been already invested in telemedicine and received promising results. The chaotic flow of patients in the emergency departments pose a unique challenge to the maintenance of quality of care especially in times of crisis and pandemics. Forward triage via telemedicine can turn these obstacles into an opportunity and provide a pathway to overcoming patient flow and reducing the workload of physicians as well as minimizing the risk of exposure of healthcare providers. It should be remembered that planning ahead can drastically improve our crisis management capabilities. It is time for our experts from different fields to start addressing this issue and put their suggestions into practice.",
