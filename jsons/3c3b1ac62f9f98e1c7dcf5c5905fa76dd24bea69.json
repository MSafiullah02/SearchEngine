Important for us is the fact that the sum runs over the full system of hadron states with flavors\u0101b (h\u0101 b ) andcd (hc d ), respectively. Consequently, the system of the intermediate hadron states that emerges in the factorizable part of \u0393(x 1 , x 2 |y 1 , y 2 ) is just the direct product of these two systems, h\u0101 b \u2297 hc d . The lowest representatives of h\u0101 b and hc d are one-meson states M\u0101 b and Mc d , respectively. No other hadron state, in particular no exotic state, contributes here. 1 Consequently, we have to conclude that \u0393 fact (x 1 , x 2 |y 1 , y 2 ) has no relationship with exotic states. An exotic state, if it exists in the hadron spectrum of\u0101bcd states, contributes only to \u0393 nonfact (x 1 , x 2 , |y 1 , y 2 ). It is also clear that any other Green function, derived from \u0393 fact (x 1 , x 2 , |y 1 , y 2 ), knows nothing about the exotic state.

            "text": ", and the latter is therefore irrelevant for the QCD sum rule for this state. An appropriate QCD sum rule for the exotic state [2] is based on the duality relation for \u03a0 dir nonfact , defined as \u03a0 dir = \u03a0 dir fact + \u03a0 dir nonfact . It might be useful to emphasize at this place the qualitative difference between the correlator of the exotic fourquark currents and the correlator of the bilinear quark currents. Consider \u03a0\u0101 b (x) = T {j\u0101 b (x)j \u2020 ab (0)} . Working in coordinate space, we may isolate the factorizable part of this function, In the correlator of the exotic currents, the factorizable part, \u03a0 dir fact (x), receives no contribution from the exotic intermediate state; therefore, no information about this exotic state may be extracted from \u03a0 dir fact . Since the perturbative O(\u03b1 0 s ) and O(\u03b1 s ) diagrams are exclusively of the factorizable type, they have no relationship with the exotic state. The OPE side of the T -adequate QCD sum rule involves nonfactorizable contributions; perturbative diagrams of this type start at order O(\u03b1 2 s ) [2] . Having in mind these arguments, let us consider the derivation of the sum rule of [1] . Constructing properly the OPE and the hadron sides, one should observe an exact cancellation of the factorizable OPE contributions against the contributions of non-interacting h\u0101 b and hc d hadron clusters on the phenomenological side. This property should follow by virtue of the QCD sum rules for \u03a0 ab and \u03a0 cd . However, Ref. [1] completely ignores the free two-meson contribution on the phenomenological side, which is clearly distinct from that of the two-meson scattering states, the latter contributing to the nonfactoriazable part of the Green function (see also discussion in [5] ). As a result, in the sum rule of [1] , the tetraquark receives contributions from the O(\u03b1 0 s ) perturbative diagrams, in contradiction with the exact cancellation phenomenon of this term with the free two-meson state contribution, as outlined above.",

This difference is related to the clusterization property of the multiquark operators [8] . For correlators of the ordinary currents, one may approximate the contribution of the hadron continuum by the effective continuum [9] , i.e., by the contribution of perturbative QCD (pQCD) diagrams above some effective threshold. Consequently, the ground-state contribution is related to the low-energy region of pQCD diagrams, starting at O(\u03b1 0 s ), complemented by condensate contributions. In the low-energy region, the ground state gives the dominant contribution on the phenomenological side of the QCD sum rule; this property is known in large-N c QCD and works well in the real world, where N c = 3.",

This property is rigorous in large-N c QCD, and holds also in real QCD. Therefore, the Ansatz for the phenomenological side of a QCD sum rule in the form \"the tetraquark pole plus the effective continuum equal to the pQCD diagrams above some effective threshold\", that worked well for the ordinary correlation functions, is inconsistent when applied to the exotic correlation functions. 3 One should first take into account the exact cancellations of factorizable diagrams on the OPE side against the contributions of non-interacting hadron clusters h\u0101 b and hc d on the phenomenological side. When these cancellations are not taken into account, one ends up with inconsistent QCD sum rules [1] .",

Now, we saturate \u03a0\u0101 b (x) with the full system of intermediate hadron states. 2 Noteworthy, the intermediate one-meson state gives a nonzero contribution not only to the full \u03a0\u0101 b , but also to its factorizable part \u03a0\u0101 b,fact . [Here is the key difference with the exotic correlators: in the latter case the tetraquark bound state does not appear in the set of the intermediate states of the factorizable part of the correlation function.] We then calculate \u03a0\u0101 b (x) using OPE, confront it against the hadron saturation, and extract, via technical procedures, the parameters of the ground state. Finally, the bulk of the meson observables come from O(\u03b1 0 s ) diagrams of \u03a0\u0101 b,fact . This procedure is quite sensible, since the intermediate ground state gives a nonzero contribution not only to the full \u03a0\u0101 b , but also to \u03a0\u0101 b,fact .",
