During immune responses to respiratory viral infections, such as influenza A, \u2022NO is generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in alveolar macrophages (AMs), pulmonary epithelial cells, and neutrophils. To produce \u2022NO, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) system is required which triggers the iNOS gene at an early stage of viral infection. Subsequently, IFN-\u03b3 through the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway induces persistent \u2022NO production at the later stages of infection (Xu et al., 2006). The \u2022NO likely functions as a signalling molecule in initiation and progression of immune responses to viral infections.",

In our Greiss assays, large variability in BAL \u2022NO levels was observed among the four independent animal trials. In mock control pigs, mean BAL \u2022NO levels showed a wide range from 2.5 to 16.63 \u03bcM/ml among the four trials. For this reason, no significant differences were detected in mean BAL \u2022NO levels among the four experimental groups in our study. These results also might be explained by use of outbred pigs and different storage times for the BAL samples after collection, because of large intervals between each animal trial. However, the trend toward increased BAL \u2022NO levels in PRCV-infected pigs at PRCV PID 2\u201310 was consistent and reproducible (Fig. 1A\u2013C).",

            "text": "As verified by others (Cox et al., 1990) and in our previous studies using the PRCV ISU-1 strain (Jung et al., 2007, Jung et al., 2009), at PRCV PID 2 and 4 (acute stage of infection), PRCV mainly infected upper and lower pulmonary epithelial cells (bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial cells and type 2 pneumocytes) and caused cytolysis, which coincided with the highest BAL \u2022NO levels among all PIDs. Pulmonary epithelial cells are known to contribute to substantial increased levels of \u2022NO in respiratory viral infections (Xu et al., 2006), whereas porcine AMs are likely to be less involved in induction of \u2022NO production in the respiratory tract (Pampusch et al., 1998). Thus, the elevated BAL NO levels following PRCV infection might originate as a result of viral-induced damage to pulmonary epithelial cells; subsequently, the increased \u2022NO might also contribute to further damage to the pulmonary epithelial cells. In addition, we speculate that the persisting, increased BAL \u2022NO levels at PRCV PID 8 and 10 also might be associated with the large numbers of AMs and lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs in parallel with necrosis of respiratory epithelial cells occurring during the same period. However, further studies are needed to identify if iNOS gene expression or if \u2022NO amounts are increased in AMs and lymphocytes following PRCV infection, although unlike murine macrophages, porcine macrophages stimulated by either IFN-\u03b3 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not induce \u2022NO production (Pampusch et al., 1998). We suggest that respiratory CoVs such as PRCV that infect pulmonary epithelial cells and cause cytolysis, induce \u2022NO production in the lungs. Based on the results, SARS-CoV that caused massive necrosis of pulmonary epithelial cells such as type 1 and 2 pneumocytes, similar to that observed in lungs of PRCV-infected pigs (Gu and Korteweg, 2007, Jung et al., 2007), might also induce \u2022NO production in the respiratory tract. It is unknown whether SARS-CoV induces \u2022NO production in the lungs and serum of patients (Akerstrom et al., 2005). In humans, concentrations of exhaled \u2022NO are measured in some clinical cases to monitor the progress of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and viral pneumonia (Xu et al., 2006). Our study demonstrated that as compared with earlier PIDs, BAL \u2022NO levels decreased dramatically on PRCV PID 14 by which time PRCV-induced pneumonia had mostly resolved (Fig. 1A and B) (Jung et al., 2009). Thus, \u2022NO levels might be monitored as an indicator of the progression of bronchopneumonia induced by PRCV, or possibly other respiratory CoVs, and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.",

In our previous study, we noted elevated IFN-\u03b3 serum levels beyond PRCV PID 10 in PRRSV/PRCV dual-infected pigs compared to either group of PRRSV or PRCV single-infected pigs, which might be associated with the more severe pneumonia in dual-infected pigs (Jung et al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that increased IFN-\u03b3 serum levels followed by elevated \u2022NO production in lung of the dual-infected pigs might be related to the exacerbated pneumonic lesions. In pigs infected with the influenza H1N2 virus, increased BAL IFN-\u03b3 levels at PID 7\u201310 coincided with increased BAL \u2022NO levels during the same period, possibly promoting viral clearance from the lungs during the middle and late stages of infection (Jung et al., 2004). In contrast, our study demonstrated that the trend toward increased Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) serum cytokine responses beyond 14 days after PRCV single or PRRSV/PRCV co-infection resulted in the reverse trend of decreased BAL \u2022NO levels in the PRCV single and PRRSV/PRCV dual-infected pigs. Thus, the induced \u2022NO levels in BAL of PRCV singly and PRCV/PRRSV dually infected pigs might not be related to the increased Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) serum and lung cytokine responses.",

Nevertheless, during the test period, high PRRSV titers in lungs and severe pneumonia were observed in PRRSV single-infected pigs as reported earlier (Jung et al., 2009). Our results concur with a prior report showing that \u2022NO levels in BAL of experimentally PRRSV (strain VR2332)-infected pigs were not increased at PID 2 and 9 (Pampusch et al., 1998), although the infected pigs had viremia at these PIDs. Our study was expanded to confirm whether PRRSV induces \u2022NO production in AMs, the major target cells for viral replication. Briefly, AMs-rich BAL cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) collected from the lungs of a five-day-old gnotobiotic pig were infected with either North American PRRSV VR2332 (105 TCID50/ml) or MN184 (105 TCID50/ml). At PTH 24, 48 and 60, the cell culture medium was harvested for the Greiss assay. There were no statistically significant differences in \u2022NO levels in the cell culture medium between PRRSV- and mock-infected AMs, although large numbers of PRRSV antigen-containing AMs were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining during the test period (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that although PRRSV induces severe apoptotic death of AMs in lungs, it may not induce \u2022NO in the respiratory tract, and that \u2022NO might not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PRRSV.",

The \u2022NO significantly inhibited PRCV replication in ST cells at PTH 24 (P\n < 0.05) and 48 (P\n < 0.01) compared to SNAP-free, virus-infected cells (Fig. 2A and B).

However, \u2022NO production was not a determinant in viral clearance from the lesions (Lane et al., 1997). Also the group 2b CoV, SARS-CoV was inhibited in Vero E6 cells treated with 400 \u03bcM SNAP (Akerstrom et al., 2005); however, as noted earlier, there is no information about \u2022NO levels in SARS patients (Akerstrom et al., 2005). On the other hand, \u2022NO did not significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in MARC145 cells at PTH 24 and 48 compared to SNAP-free, virus-infected cells (Fig. 2C and D).

(A and C) \u2022NO production in ST and MARC145 cells, respectively. ST and MARC145 cells were treated with SNAP at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 \u03bcM), and cell supernatants were harvested at PTH 24 and 48 for the Griess assay. (B and D) The antiviral effects of \u2022NO on PRCV replication in ST cells and PRRSV replication in MARC145 cells, respectively. The SNAP-treated, virus-infected and SNAP-untreated, virus-infected cells were infected with PRCV or PRRSV (105\u20136 TCID50/ml), with or without SNAP, respectively. At PTH 24 and 48, the cells were fixed in 95% ethanol and the TCID50/ml was titrated by immunofluorescent staining using virus-specific monoclonal antibodies (SDOW-17 for PRRSV and 25H7/14E3 for PRCV). The TCID50/ml was calculated according to the Reed and Muench method. All assays were performed independently three times. All data are expressed as the means \u00b1 SEM. Asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01) indicate statistically significant differences between SNAP-treated, virus-infected and SNAP-untreated, virus-infected cells by unpaired Student's t-test.",
