Between influenza epidemics, seasonal influenza outbreaks typically occur during the late winter/early spring months. In addition, there are several respiratory viruses that present as influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses (COR), rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (R/E), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 1e6 The dynamic temporal relationships between ILI respiratory viruses and influenza in hospitalized children and adults have not been well characterized. 6e10 The seasonal peaks of individual ILI viruses are well known. Winter ILI viruses include HPIV and RSV; rhinoviruses are autumn/spring ILI viruses; and the enteroviruses are summer/ autumn viruses. Until recently, precise diagnosis of ILI respiratory viruses was frequently not undertaken. However, with the availability of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Week diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses it is now possible to study the temporal relationships between influenza and ILI viruses.",

From a clinical perspective viral pneumonias due to ILIs in hospitalized children and adults may resemble not only influenza, but also non-viral aetiologies of communityacquired pneumonia; thus knowledge of a diagnosis of ILI may benefit antibiotic and antiviral stewardship. 2 From an infection control (IC) standpoint, viral pneumonias due to ILI viruses in hospitalized adults present bed occupancy problems, and may have longer lengths of stay than influenza across all adult age groups. 3 Optimally e availability of isolation rooms permitting e ILI viral pneumonias require the same IC precautions as influenza; this may be problematic where there is significant overlap of ILI and influenza intensities. Cohorting of viral community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) due to ILIs may help, but ideally should be limited to patients shown to have the same viral aetiology.",

Moreover, it took place over an unusually mild influenza A season. As such, our findings may not be generalizable. However, our study does suggests that ILI viral surveillance cannot be used the predict the onset of the annual peak in influenza A activity in adults, and that the close concurrence between peaks of influenza A and hMPV activity indicates that there is always value in undertaking viral diagnostic testing. However, as might be expected, the peak occurrence of influenza A infection was preceded by two separate peaks of ILI, first caused by R/E, and then RSV. Perhaps not unexpectedly, ILI temporal dynamics in hospitalized adults and children were quite different from each other. Whereas it is generally assumed that ILIs and influenza viruses co-circulate in the community, our data suggest that there is usually only a single predominant virus in hospitalized patients. If this finding is confirmed by other studies, it does suggest that there is considerable scope for cohort isolation of viral respiratory tract infections in hospitals.",

The clinical wisdom that the only thing predictable about influenza is that it is unpredictable remains valid.",
