The COVID-19 pandemic has overlapped with the scheduled interview periods of over 20 surgical subspecialty fellowships, including the Complex General Surgical Oncology (CGSO) fellowships in the National Resident Matching Program and the Society of Surgical Oncology's Breast Surgical Oncology fellowships. We outline the successful implementation of and processes behind a virtual interview day for CGSO fellowship recruitment after the start of the pandemic. Methods. The virtual CGSO fellowship interview process at the University of Chicago Medicine and NorthShore University Health System was outlined and implemented. Separate voluntary, anonymous online secure feedback surveys were email distributed to interview applicants and faculty interviewers after the interview day concluded. Results. Sixteen of 20 interview applicants (80.0%) and 12 of 13 faculty interviewers (92.3%) completed their respective feedback surveys. Seventy-five percent (12/16) of applicants and all faculty respondents (12/12) stated the interview process was 'very seamless' or 'seamless'. Applicants and faculty highlighted decreased cost, time savings, and increased efficiency as some of the benefits to virtual interviewing. Conclusions.",

Current recommendations for social distancing have prompted universal and obligatory efforts to adjust fellowship recruitment to a virtual format. Published studies of web-based residency and fellowship interviews are limited.

Additionally, we provide survey results from both applicants and faculty interviewers regarding their virtual interview day experiences and outline our recommendations to reimagine recruitment in the era of COVID-19.

The website replaced paper materials traditionally handed to applicants and gave applicants additional exposure to faculty members and fellows whom they might not meet through the videoconference interview format (https://voices.uchicago.edu/surgicaloncology). \u2022 Extra program and technical support staff time was reserved for the interview day for immediate troubleshooting assistance. \u2022 A digitized interview ranking sheet was retooled and trialed that collated and visually displayed scoring and narrative commentary results immediately after the interviews were completed.",

Faculty also echoed the enhanced efficiency and convenience. Oladeji et al. found that the mean total cost for orthopedic fellowship match interviews was US$5875. 11 Watson et al. reported that 62.3% of general surgery residents spent over US$4000 and 21.7% spent over US$8000 for fellowship interviews. 12 Given the current climate of rising student debt, our forced transition to virtual interviewing during the COVID-19 pandemic permits us to rethink how surgery subspecialties structure recruitment, both now and in the future. This would also improve institutional resources, as a prior survey found that, on average, over US$8000 is spent by the host program in hard costs. 13 Additionally, residency programs would be less disrupted by interviewing residents who miss an average of 1 week to 10 days for fellowship interviews and associated travel. 11, 12 Overall, our survey respondents found the virtual videoconference interview process to be seamless and applicants were able to convey themselves well. Notably, however, the surveys showed that live interviews were preferred. Before COVID-19, applicants had the option of visiting programs even if they participated in virtual interviews. This obviated the financial incentive of saved travel costs but was a contingency option if an interviewee felt they needed a more in-depth live impression of a program or wished to bolster his or her candidacy with inperson meetings. 8 There also remains some concerns about how comparable virtual interviews are to live interviews, as prior publications reported applicants and programs did not always feel interviewees could represent themselves well through videoconference methods. 2, 4 Our survey showed that although in the minority, there were applicants who did not feel they conveyed themselves well during the video interviews.",
