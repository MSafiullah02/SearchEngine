            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious upper respiratory tract disease which reached epidemic status in 2003.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The first reported outbreak of the disease occurred in 2002 in the Guangdong province of China. Within the span of a year the disease had spread over to 32 countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. The disease infected nearly 8000 people worldwide with an average mortality rate of around 10%. The etiological agent of the disease was identified as a previously unknown human coronavirus christened as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus from the coronaviridae family containing a single chain RNA genome of \u223c29,700 nucleotides, the largest viral RNA genome reported to date.6, 7 Although there have been no reported occurrences of SARS infections since 2004, the disease should still be treated as a high health risk because of its high virulence and contagious nature. Historical evidence on several viral diseases, such as influenza, suggests that recurrences of epidemic outbreaks, caused by the wild-type or mutated variants of the virus, are common. These recurrences are usually spread over a long period of time and may occur in regions which are geographically distant to each other. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the understanding of the etiology, pathology, and possible therapeutic targets against this virus. Knowledge gained from these studies can not only be used in the design of therapies against the current form of the virus but may be carried over in the future to other mutated variants or other pathogenic viruses from the same family.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV genome contains two open reading frames connected by a ribosomal frame shift which encode for two large replicase polyproteins pp1a (\u223c450 kDa) and pp1ab (\u223c750 kDa) which function in the viral replication and transcription processes. The polyproteins are processed by viral proteases8, 9 to generate the functional components of a multiprotein complex known as viral replicase\u2013transcriptase.10, 11 While most coronaviruses utilize three proteases for proteolytic processing the SARS-CoV is known to encode only two proteases for this purpose. These two proteases include a papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2pro)12 and a Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro). The 3CLpro enzyme13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 is also called as the main protease (Mpro) since it plays a pivotal role in the processing of the viral polyproteins and controlling of the replicase complex activity. The enzyme is indispensable to the viral replication and infection processes, thereby making it an ideal target for the design of antiviral therapy. The availability of multiple crystal structures19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 of the enzyme with co-crystallized ligands makes the target amenable to structure-based drug design.",

The peptidic inhibitors were designed by attaching a reactive \u2018warhead\u2019 type agent to a peptide mimicking the natural substrate. These warhead groups include Michael acceptors,23, 29, 34 aldehydes,29, 37 epoxy ketones,32 halo methyl ketones,33 and a few others.38 These inhibitors act through a two-step procedure wherein they first bind and form a non-covalent complex with the enzyme such that the warhead group is located in close vicinity of the catalytic residue. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine and covalent adduct formation. The other category includes the non-peptidic inhibitors containing small molecule scaffolds. These inhibitors have been discovered using various techniques such as structure based virtual screening,24, 36, 39, 35 pharmacophore based screening40 as well as high through screening41 methodologies.",

Structure based virtual screening involves the in silico evaluation of a database of molecules against the experimentally determined structure or a comparative model of the protein target using a docking program. Evaluation of the generated docking poses is carried out using a metric such as a scoring function to identify putative binders. Compared to the high throughput screening of an entire compound library, only a small set of molecules selected on the basis of the screening strategy is evaluated in a biological assay to identify inhibitors of the target. In the present study, the Asinex Platinum collection was screened against the SARS-3CLpro enzyme crystal structure using the Gold docking program. Biological evaluation of a selected set of compounds in a SARS-3CLpro inhibition assay led to the identification of novel hits with activity in the low micromolar range which could be further optimized to develop potent antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV infections.",

            "text": "The 33.8 kDa SARS-3CLpro enzyme is a functional homodimer and shows three structural domains with an antiparallel \u03b2-barrel-shaped structure akin to the serine protease Chymotrypsin. The active site is located in a groove between the domains I and II and is a fairly solvent exposed and shallow cavity. The enzyme is an atypical cysteine protease, containing a catalytic diad (His41-Cys145) instead of a triad. Multiple crystal structures of SARS-3CLpro with co-crystallized inhibitors (1UK4,19 2AMD,20 PDB code) have been elucidated. The co-crystallized peptidic Michael-acceptor based inhibitor 9IN, from the SARS-3CLpro structure (2AMD, PDB code), is structurally analogous to the Cbz protected hexapeptide-CMK (chloro methyl ketone) inhibitor (1UK4, PDB code) and undergoes similar binding site interactions. Therefore, the co-crystallized pose of 9IN (Fig. 2\na and b) is used here to describe the relevant binding site interactions and the enzyme\u2019s subsite specificity. Mutation studies44 have been carried out on the substrates of related coronavirus proteases to understand the specificity at each of the binding subsites and the effect of these mutations on the substrate binding and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. It was found that the mutations at the P1 position produced the most significant loss in enzyme activity and the corresponding S1 sub site is very specific to a Glutamine residue. The other subsites of interest were S1\u2032, S2, and S4 and the preferred substrate amino acid side chains for these sites were S1\u2032 (alanine/serine), S2 (leucine), and S4 (valine/serine). In case of the 9IN co-crystallized pose, the \u03b2-carbon of the Michael acceptor forms a covalent bond with the sulfur of the catalytic cysteine (Cys145). The cyclized ketoglutamine group occupies the S1 subsite and acts as an entropically favored surrogate for the glutamine side chain of the native substrate. The carbonyl oxygen of the ketoglutamine group undergoes a hydrogen bonding interaction with His163 while the ring amide NH forms a hydrogen bond donor interaction with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe140. The side chain of Glu166 is also in close vicinity to form a hydrogen bond interaction with the ring amide NH group after minor rotameric adjustment. An interaction of this nature between the nitrogen of the P1-glutamine side chain or its surrogate and the side chain carboxylate oxygen of Glu166 is seen in the crystal structure of SARS-3CLpro inhibited by an aza peptide epoxide22 (2A5I, PDB code) as well as a peptidic aldehyde29 (2GX4, PDB code) based inhibitor. The S2 (His41, Met49, Tyr54) and S4 (Met 130, Pro163, Gln192) subsites are primarily hydrophobic in nature and are occupied by a leucine and valine residue, respectively. The terminal ethyl group of the ligand occupies the S1\u2032 site and undergoes hydrophobic interactions with Thr25 and Leu27. Additional hydrogen bonds are noticed between the peptidic backbone of the ligand and the residues Glu166, Gln189, and Thr190. Overall, the presence of hydrophobic groups at the S1\u2032, S2, and S4 sites and a hydrogen bond acceptor at the S1\u2032 site can be considered as critical pharmacophoric requirements (Fig. 2c) for the binding of putative inhibitors.",

The ligand has a large number of rotatable bonds and improperly resolved coordinates for the terminal portion of the ligand where the catalytic cysteine sulfur forms a covalent adduct with the ligand. Therefore, it was not feasible to conduct a pose validation study using this ligand structure. A series of phthalhydrazide based peptidic analogues45 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1) with inhibitory activity against the SARS-3CLpro had been reported and was utilized in a validation study using Gold 2.2 to select the binding site definition and scoring function utilized for binding pose calculation. Amongst the thirteen ketoglutamine based analogues four had IC50 values of 10 \u03bcM or less (pIC50\n \u2a7e 5, IC50\n \u2a7d 10 \u03bcM), four had IC50 values ranging from 10 to 100 \u03bcM while five had activities greater than 100 \u03bcM (pIC50\n \u2a7d 4, IC50\n \u2a7e 100 \u03bcM). Typically, a molecule with a higher binding affinity would have a better interaction and geometrical profile as compared to that of molecule with a weaker binding affinity. A scoring function should be able to evaluate the quality of the binding poses and separate the poses of the actives (IC50\n \u2a7d 10 \u03bcM) and the inactives (IC50\n \u2a7e 100 \u03bcM) based on their docking scores. The docking calculations were conducted using the Gold standard mode speed up which allows for 100,000 genetic operations per docking pose. The Goldscore function was evaluated for its predictive ability and was found to provide a score based separation of the actives and the inactives (Supplementary information, Table S1). The separation becomes more pronounced if one outlier (molecule 4), which was awarded a lower docking score. was discounted from the comparison.

One approach we have successfully used previously46, 47 toward minimizing the overall down time without compromising the quality is to carry out a multi-stage cascade docking involving a less intensive and faster docking protocol at the early stages of the screening and a gradual increment in the computational complexity as we proceed toward the final stages. Typically, at the early stages of screening, the aim is to look for shape complementarity of the docked molecules against the binding site and elimination of molecules with low probability of attaining a proper binding pose within the active site. On the contrary, the final stage of the screening process involves the selection of deserving hits based on their complementarity with the binding site interactions and the geometrical qualities of the binding pose itself. While the elimination stage can be handled by a less intensive docking calculation, a more rigorous protocol incorporating exhaustive conformational sampling is a critical requirement for the final stages of the screening. In this case, a three stage docking protocol of increasing computational complexity (Fig. 3\n) was implemented using the Gold 2.2 docking program.",

Molecules with a predicted absorbtion level of 0 (good absorbtion) and predicted solubility level of 2\u20134 (low-optimal) were selected for the next stage. The filtered database comprised of \u223c32,000 molecules which was submitted for 3D-coordinates generation in Concord (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The reported active molecules (including the ketoglutamine series) used in the docking validation studies were sketched in Sybyl 6.9. Protonation states, bond types, and atom types for the molecules were assigned manually. The structures were refined using 2000 steps of conjugate gradient to a RMS convergence of 0.01 kcal/mol \u00c5 using the Tripos force field and Gasteiger\u2013Huckel partial charge method.",

Both SARS-3CLpro structures used in the study, 1UK4 and 2AMD (PDB code), contain co-crystallized ligands covalently bound to the catalytic cysteine residue. To prepare the protein for docking, the covalent bond between the ligand and the protein residue was deleted. Protonation state, tautomeric state, and hydrogen addition for the protein were carried out using the PPREP (Schrodinger, LLC, Portland, OR) utility while the co-crystallized ligands were handled manually. Manual protonation and tautomeric state modifications of certain key binding site residues were carried out. The Glu166 and His172 residue participates in a salt bridge interaction and was therefore modeled in the charged state. His163 forms a critical hydrogen bond donor interaction with the Glutamine (P1 residue) side chain oxygen of the natural substrate and was modeled in the His-\u03b5 protonation state. The catalytic diad Cys145-His41 was modeled in the neutral state. The all hydrogen protein\u2013ligand complex was then submitted to restrained molecular mechanics refinement using the OPLS2001 force field incorporated in the IMPREF (Schrodinger, LLC, Portland, OR) protein structure refinement utility.

The binding site was defined using a cavity detection algorithm by searching 10 \u01fa around the sulfur atom of Cys145. The first phase validation study was carried out using the Gold standard mode and the Goldscore function for pose selection. Scoring of the ligand binding poses using multiple scoring functions was conducted using the Cscore module of Sybyl 6.9. Pose validation and enrichment studies in the extension phase of the screening were conducted in Gold 3.0.1 using automatic GA settings-200% accuracy level. The final docking protocol for the extension phase was identical to the first phase in terms of binding site definition and scoring function for pose selection. Hydrophobic constraints (Fig. 4d) were defined as spheres of 2 \u01fa radius defined around the centroid of the heavy atoms of the hydrophobic groups while a protein hydrogen bond donor constraint (Fig. 4d) was defined using the N(\u03b5)\u2013H of His163. The enrichment study was conducted using a dataset comprising of 19 actives (Supplementary information, Fig. S2) and 897 dummy (inactive) molecules taken from the ZINC database (http://zinc.docking.org/). The range scaled scores were calculated using expression 1 implemented in a python script.(1)Sn(Range scaled)=\u2211(Sn-Smin)/(Smax-Smin).where S\nn(Range scaled) is the range scaled score, S\nn is the score obtained for a molecule within the docked set, S\nmax is the maximum score obtained for a molecule within the docked set, S\nmin is the minimum score obtained for a molecule within the docked set.GDRn=[(Sn-Smin)/(Smax-Smin)]Gscore+[(Sn-Smin)/(Smax-Smin)]Dscore.\n",

Four 1-l cultures were grown and induced. Four pellets of approximately 3 g each were harvested and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. For the purification process the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM potassium chloride (pH 7.8), 400 mM sodium chloride, 100 mM potassium chloride, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 mM imidazole) and broken by French press. The lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected and loaded on a nickel affinity column (Pharmacia) that had been pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 300 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM imidazole). The column was washed with binding buffer and the protease was eluted with binding buffer plus 300 mM imidazole. The histidine tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. The enzyme showed >95% purity as assessed by SDS\u2013PAGE. The purified protease was concentrated and stored in storage buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) at \u221280 \u00b0C. The purified enzyme was assayed using a fluorogenic peptide (Dabcyl-TSAVLQSGFR-Edans) and found to be active.
