Neoclassical economists have been warning that expansionary macroeconomic policies are not only useless but can even be harmful (e.g. Phelps). These stark differences in the evaluation of economic policy proposals are deeply rooted in their underlying microeconomic reasoning, in the theories of the motivation and behaviour of economic agents as investors, workers, consumers and speculators as well as their interactions. The claim of missing micro-foundations in Keynes's theory is false. In contrast, recent fi ndings of behavioural economics have strongly confi rmed Keynes's micro-foundations that lead to his macroeconomic conclusions.",

Lucas and Sargent (1979) famously alleged that Keynes's theory was intellectually fl awed because it misses micro-foundations. This allegation is intellectually fl awed. Instead, Keynes's microeconomic foundations are the key to understanding his macroeconomics (Hahn, 1997) . Keynes induced his micro-foundations from observed actual behaviour of entrepreneurs, speculators, workers and consumers in a monetary economy in which precautionary savings, speculations and investments are pursued in a dynamic environment under uncertainty. Behavioural economics is also based on this inductive methodological approach aimed at describing actual human behaviour. This approach contrasts sharply with the fi ctitious world deduced from neoclassical axioms.",

In the equilibrium of the latter, all resources are fully used (full-employment equilibrium); no one can improve in the existing institutional framework through voluntary trade. There is no need for macroeconomic stimulation since the economy is already in the optimum (full-employment equilibrium); on the contrary, stimulation will destroy this optimal full-employment equilibrium, resulting in infl ation only (Keynes 1936, 294) . If the economy is assumed to be in full-employment equilibrium, improvements in growth and employment require shifts in the optimal equilibrium itself through, e.g. institutional reforms and the enhancement of productivity growth -just as Phelps suggested. However, the optimal equilibrium is an unverifi ed assumption (Blinder and Solow, 1973) .",

To stimulate economic activity and overcome the stalemate, Keynes suggested expansionary macroeconomic policies (fi scal and/or monetary) to achieve full-employment equilibrium. The nature of the economic environment in which individuals operate as well as their behaviour distinguishes Keynes's theory from the axiomatic neoclassical model and results in the fundamentally different macroeconomic policy approaches. This paper discusses the major commonalities between behavioural economics and Keynes's microeconomics as well as their distinction from neoclassical assumptions. The following sections discuss the analytical basis for the diverging views on the motivation of agents deduced from neoclassical axioms versus induced microeconomic theory. The research in behavioural economics impressively confi rms Keynes's observations but contradicts neoclassical axioms.",

Theoretical models stripped of irrelevant aspects should simplify the real world and help to better understand economic behaviour. Theories should work like glasses, but oversimplification may lead them to function instead like blinders. Does economic theory need to relate to the real world, or can theory be totally abstract from actual human behaviour? This is the fundamental methodological issue that distinguishes behavioural economics and Keynes's theory from the neoclassical model with far-reaching consequences. Both behavioural economics and Keynes regard economics as a real science such as physics or biology, where only assumptions that do not confl ict with reality describe the world we live in (Kornai, 1971) . Neoclassical economics is based on an axiomatic approach as applied in mathematical, logical sciences, in which truth is established through formal deductions from the axioms, which are not necessarily related to reality (Kornai, 1971) . It assumes selfi sh, independent and socially isolated individuals who maximise their utility derived from real values (goods) along well-ordered and stable preferences using all available information (rational choice), subject to budget constraints. The interaction among individuals is limited to market exchange, i.e. choices made by other individuals leave their preferences unaffected; there are no trends, no fashions, no ostentation, no positional goods. Do individual motivation and decisionmaking follow the neoclassical axioms?",

On the contrary, he claimed, \"Truly important and signifi cant hypotheses will be found to have 'assumptions' that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality\" (Friedman 1953, 8) . 4 The only way to prove a theory is to determine whether its predictions are in accordance with the observed outcomes, but Friedman simply declared observed outcomes as optimal (utility-or profi t-maxima), which is not the same as providing evidence. \"When verifi cation is demanded, they [neoclassical economists] tend to look for evidence that the theory makes correct predictions and resist advice that they should look instead directly at the decision mechanisms and processes\" (Simon 1986, 38) .

However, most people regard their economic decisions as purposeful behaviour and have evaluated some pros and cons in order to reach the decision (at least if a more signifi cant amount is spent). But rational choice means choosing the utility or profi t-maximising alternative, which requires the intention to maximise as well as the ability to evaluate alternatives. Rational expectations require knowledge of all possible future events and their probabilities to calculate expected outcomes, which is a stochastic version of perfect foresight (Arrow, 1987) . At best, rational expectations may apply to a steady-state economy where only external shocks can disturb the assumed smooth market process. The economy is treated like roulette, where the number of the next draw is unknown but where the probability distribution is known, i.e. while playing roulette is risky, one of the 37 possibilities must occur. However, is the economy actually moving along a smooth equilibrium path only disturbed by external shocks? Are expectations formed as mechanically as as-",

            "text": "Today, neoclassical economics simply builds models for variations of risk and ignores uncertainty as it did when Keynes was writing (Keynes, 1937, 212-213) . Academic economists can ignore uncertainty and construct theories for an assumed certain or risky world (Arthur, 1994) . But entrepreneurs make decisions in the world we live in, where uncertainty cannot be ignored, interdependencies are relevant as in fi nancial markets, and where expectations are about the expectations of others (Keynesian beauty contest; Arrow, 1987) The entrepreneur's production decisions depend on the expected demand, which in turn affects employment, labour income and demand; i.e. economic developments are endogenous -tomorrow's events depend on today's actions (Robinson, 1980; Howitt, 1986) . Also, preferences may not be formed in isolation and are not fi xed but may change under the infl uence of the decision of others. Economic agents, including businesspeople, must apply other guesswork, conventions, intuitions, emotions and animal spirits in order to decide. Clearly, the pros and cons will be evaluated before deciding on purchases and investments involving signifi cant amounts. Possibly some probabilities may be assigned to certain outcomes, but uncertainty will remain and cannot be eliminated. Individuals can ascribe a certain probability to future events, but in an open, dynamic environment, these are bets (Dow, 2012) . Keynes emphasises conventional behaviour (routines, heuristics) as an essential decision rule under uncertainty. Conventional behaviour or a conventional method of calculation assumes \"that the existing state of affairs will continue indefi nitely, except in so far as we have a specifi c reason to expect a change\" (Keynes, 1936, 152) . Economic agents rely on a limited number of heuristic principles (such as representativeness, availability, anchoring), intended to reduce complexity (Kahnemann, 2002, 465) .",

In an early experiment, Allais (1953) observed that the decision criterion under risk changes from expected payments to higher probability, resulting in contradictory choices between two lotteries (known as the Allais paradox). Participants in Allais's experiment had to choose between lotteries and voted (rationally) for the one with the highest expected value. When Allais changed the probabilities to one lottery with a guaranteed but lower gain compared to the other with a much higher expected value but also a minor chance of a zero gain, participants switched to the former. Obviously, certainty is preferred over higher gains with a slight probability of no gain. 8 Participants did not adhere to the axiom of rationality, and therefore the person's choices cannot be attributed to maximising the utility functions. Was it just a lack of understanding that caused the inconsistency of the participants' choices? Allais repeated his experiment at a conference with distinguished economics professors (among them Friedman, Samuelson, Savage and Arrow, according to Kahneman, 2011, 312-314) . Even these distinguished fellows switched preferences as laypersons did, not noticing that their expressed preferences violated rational choice. 9 A necessary condition for utility-maximising choices is accurate and unbiased forecasts of the hedonic outcomes of potential choices (Kahneman and Thaler, 2006) . Many fi ndings of behavioural economics suggest that the stable preferences assumption underlying the neoclassical model does not hold. To maximise utility requires correct knowledge of the utility that a specifi c product will provide. However, expected utility today and the utility experienced in the future might deviate substantially. People's (expected) utility seems to be strongly affected by the situation, their moods, the environment and time. \"However, people do not always know what they will like, and they are likely to err most severely when the temporal gap is long and when the agent's state and circumstances vary between t1 and t0\" (Kahneman and Thaler, 2006, 223) . To choose rationally economic agents must not only rank all possible choices, but they must also discount the future utility into present values, i.e. the measurement of utility needs to be cardinal. Furthermore, the future (expected) utility must be independent of current choices, but utility ascribed to a product may differ once a person owns the product (i.e. endowment effect, habituation, change of preferences, path dependence). Humans seem to value gains less than losses (prospect theory; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) . Participants in fi nancial markets, presumably closest to the perfect market model (Schettkat, 2010) , illustrate this behaviour: investors tend to keep shares even though the prices of which are falling.",

Neoclassical economics restricts the interaction among individuals to market exchange. For example, consumption of other individuals may affect relative prices (and via this mechanism, the choices), but the utility functions will remain unaffected. 10 This assumption is obviously not descriptive of the behaviour of social beings, but it is still alive and well in economics. \"To many economists, the notion of consumers being strongly infl uenced by demonstration effects must have seemed probably inconsistent with the reasoned pursuit of self-interests, if not completely irrational\" (Frank, 1985, 146) .",

Thus, signaling social status and demonstrating one's lifestyle through consumption is vital for socially embedded individuals (Leibenstein, 1975; Hirsch, 1976) .

            "text": "The valuation of situations related to reference points is arguably the most crucial fi nding in behavioural economics, especially in the context of methodological concerns. The endowment effect (Kahneman et al., 1991) refers to changes in the valuation of products, depending on the possession of a product. When buying a product, its utility should be equal to the utility derived from the money that was paid for it (respectively to the alternative products the money could have bought). However, it turns out that, once a product is possessed, it is only sold at a signifi cantly higher price (although the owner would not have paid the potential selling price). Such behaviour has been observed for football and concert tickets (Krueger, 2001) , bottles of wine and even coffee mugs. The utility derived from the possession of the product rose after the consumer possessed it. In other words, preferences are endogenous and are evaluated asymmetrically, as summarised by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) . Kahneman and Tversky found that the utility gain of adding an additional unit of a certain product is less than the utility loss of subtracting a unit of the very same product would be. The orientation on reference points implies changes in the utility function, i.e. the neoclassical assumption of stable preferences is violated. Komlos (2014) translated the impact of prospect theory into conventional indifference curves and shows that, after initial maximisation (in which the budget constraint is tangential to an indifference curve), kinks will arise at the reference point because of the differing valuation of the gains and losses. The marginal rate of substitution between two goods X and Y (m = -dY i /dX i ) changes, because the loss in Y weighs greater than the gain in X. In other words, the slope of the indifference curve changed, even if the maximisation procedure was initially performed. In a new situation, however, asymmetric evaluation will repeat. Therefore, neoclassical theorist Pesendorfer (2006) concludes that a rational economic agent, knowing that a decision changes her preferences, will refrain from maximisation. In other words, a rational economic agent does not follow rational decision-making because the basis for it does not exist -super rationality.",

On the contrary, Keynesian micro-foundations are induced from observed economic behaviour in the world we live in and are strongly confi rmed by the fi ndings of behavioural economics. Keynes and behavioural economics share an inductive methodological approach that refers to the economy we live in, and that allows for socially embedded individuals. The experiments and tests in behavioural economics extend far beyond Keynes's casual observations, providing rigorous evidence for regularities in economic human behaviour which contradict neoclassical axioms and should not be ignored. Furthermore, the world we live in is not a risky move along a steady state path, but it is uncertain with the consequence that expectations cannot be based on cold calculations, they cannot be calculated rational expectations; instead, they are endogenous and made under uncertainty. Today's expectations and decisions affect tomorrow's outcomes. Since behavioural economic fi ndings contradict the neoclassical axioms, it may provide the seeds of a scientifi c revolution in the Kuhnian sense (Kuhn, 1970) . 13 These seeds, within broader, more realistic economics, were already underlying Keynes's micro-foundations of his macroeconomics.",
