As of May 17, 2020 there have been 4,708,415 cases and 314,950 deaths worldwide [2]. In rapid response to the pandemic, academic and industry scientists from around the world have initiated efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics for disease prevention and patient management. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is funding work to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using a variety of technology platforms. Several vaccine candidates are already in Phase 1 studies with others likely to enter the clinic in the next few months [3].",

            "text": "One of the challenges facing rapid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 is the need to adequately assure the safety of these vaccines. One such safety concern is disease enhancement syndrome that occurred in the 1960s with inactivated RSV and measles vaccines. Vaccine-mediated disease enhancement is characterized by a vaccine that results in increased disease severity if the subject is later infected by the natural virus. During early trials with inactivated RSV vaccine, the vaccine did not prevent infection, 80% of those infected required hospitalization and two children died [4]. Lung pathology in patients showed an unexpected inflammatory response with both neutrophils and eosinophils, evidence of immune complex formation and complement activation in small airways [5]. Scientists later learned that the vaccine caused a similar disease enhancement in animals characterized by immunopathology and a T helper cell type 2 (Th2) biased response and antibody responses with poor neutralizing activity [6], [7], [8]. Since that time, the animal models have been relied upon to predict safety for new RSV vaccines that are developed. Of note, the pathogenesis of RSV disease enhancement is distinct from antibody disease enhancement (ADE) which occurs for macrophage tropic viruses, demonstrated most notably for Dengue in humans and the coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus in cats, and is directly caused by non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies leading to more efficient viral uptake via Fc\u03b3 receptor binding [9].",

Therefore, CEPI and the Brighton Collaboration Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) convened a scientific working meeting https://brightoncollaboration.us/brighton-collaboration-cepi-covid-19-web-conference/) on March 12 and 13, 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to discuss current knowledge that could form the basis for the assessment of the risk of enhanced disease during SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. This consensus report presents considerations for vaccine developers and can serve as a guide for the development and testing of vaccine candidates to avoid these safety concerns. Ultimately, the door to clinical trials is controlled by regulators in the context of the risk/benefit for the entire dataset provided by developers and within the local trial context.",

Subsequent passage of SARS-CoV-1 through mouse lungs resulted in the isolation of virus that caused severe disease in both young and old mice [11], [12]. This virus was used in many subsequent studies. Ferret models of SARS-CoV-1 also demonstrate virus replication in respiratory tracts with induction of a neutralizing antibody response but also demonstrated little evidence of clinical disease [13]. Hamsters, in contrast to mice and ferrets, demonstrate high levels of viral replication, develop pneumonitis, and can be shown to have clinical signs of disease [14]. Following the identification of human ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV-1, transgenic murine models expressing human ACE2 receptor (hACE2) were developed and shown to develop mild pulmonary disease. Of note, these mice also developed lethal viral encephalitis, attributed to viral spread through the olfactory nerve, despite the relative scarcity of hACE2 expression in the brain which may have relevance to SARS-CoV-2 disease [15].",

For vectored vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-1 proteins, it was shown that viral proteins were expressed in mice, ferrets, and hamsters. In these studies, neutralizing antibodies were elicited by B/HPIV3, VSV, rabies, MVA and adeno viruses expressing S protein, that protected against SARS-CoV-1 replication in lungs of challenged animals.

Ad5-hDPP4 transduced mice could be infected with MERS virus but infection was associated with minimal clinical disease except in immunocompromised mice that developed weight loss after infection. Of note, hDPP4-transgenic mice developed lethal viral encephalitis with concurrent inflammatory changes on histopathological examination of the lung, similar to hACE2-Tg mice with SARS-CoV-1. Subsequently, investigators developed mice \u201cknocked-in\u201d for expression of hDPP4 and after virus passage in these mice, identified mouse-adapted MERS strains that caused more severe disease and increased histopathology with more pulmonary edema than those infected with the original MERS strain [19]. Importantly, mice without functional T cells, such as RAG1-/- and TCR alpha-/-, had delayed viral clearance whereas mice that could not produce antibodies, muMT mice, did not show delay in clearance. Similar models were developed by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of two residues in the mouse ACE2 molecule, followed by mouse adaptation with serial passage, leading to an ARDS model of lethal infection [20], [21]. Taken together this evidence supports the notion that T cells are important in viral clearance for MERS [22].",

This injury was characterized by decreased wound healing, and increased pro-inflammatory macrophages expressing IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 [38]. This report also demonstrated that passively administered anti-S antibody was associated with lung pathology after challenge with the live virus although the mechanism may not be through Fc receptor and thus not classic \u201cADE\u201d. Of note, a second report similarly demonstrates the effect with certain anti-S antibody preparations and without Fc involvement [39], [40]. The relevance of these reports remains unclear as there are multiple studies with administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to different models that did not induce disease enhancement. Other investigators have reported absence of disease enhancement in both hamsters and monkeys immunized with a whole inactivated vaccine although these models differed in a number of ways, most notably by the use of BPL (\u03b2-Propiolactone) instead of formalin for inactivation of the virus [41], [42].

Phylogenetic relationships within CoVs have been established, and Group 2B includes SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-like CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, BtCoV WIV1 and BtCoV SHC014. Similarly, Group 2C are MERS-like CoVs which are also poised for human emergence. Within Group 2B, known SARS-like CoVs are divided into high or low pre-epidemic potential. High risk features include use of ACE2 for cell entry, growth in primary human airway cells, causing ARDS, causing age-related disease severity, and escape from existing immune therapeutics. Drivers of CoV evolution include the high mutation rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase paired with the regulated fidelity complex. CoVs also demonstrate high rates of RNA recombination as during mixed infection up to 25% of progeny are recombinant, and modular evolution allows CoVs to swap whole genes or portions of key proteins between strains. The S protein itself, which regulates host range, tissue tropism, and transmissibility, can tolerate a high mutation rate while retaining its function.",

Group 2B viruses have fourteen contact interfaces between their S protein and ACE2. Variation across the interface sites can facilitate orthologous species ACE2 receptor usage, since as few as seven interface sites are needed for entry. The prefusion structure of the S glycoprotein has three major antigenic domains, receptor binding domain (RBD), N terminal Domain (NTD), and S2. Epitopes on SARS-CoV-1 RBD have been identified as targets for neutralizing antibodies. Analyzing the variations and conserved regions in the S protein of Group 2B SARS-like CoVs, shows conserved sites on the S2 region that could be targeted in broad-based therapeutics against multiple CoVs.",

The advantages of mRNA vaccines include ability to create a highly precise type of protein to elicit the correct antibodies, to elicit T cell responses that are Th1 predominant, and the rapidity of manufacturing.

Several adjuvants are now being used in commercial vaccines or are in clinical development [48]. Oil-in-water emulsions such as MF59 or AS03 have been shown to increase the breadth of the antibody repertoire, binding affinity and affinity maturation when compared to unadjuvanted vaccines [49], [50] In human studies with influenza vaccines, H5N1 vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 (squalene-based emulsion) increased the levels of H5-specific antibody for subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 and the binding to Fc\u03b3R2 but not to Fc\u03b3R3 when compared to alum adjuvanted vaccines. This demonstrates that the use of an adjuvant can skew the functionality profile of antigen-specific antibodies, with the potential to activate different innate effectors based on their Fc\u03b3R expression [51]. Use of squalene-based emulsion vaccines for influenza have also been shown to increase CD4+ T cell response frequencies and cross-reactivity. Even if pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies are present prior to immunization, such adjuvants could activate na\u00efve B cells and promote the adaptability of memory B cells [52], [53], [54], [55].",

Human malaria challenge studies provided early evidence that the choice of adjuvants(combined with the malaria antigen RTS,S) was critical in achieving optimal protection and highlighted the importance of cellular response [56]. More recently, studies with Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBs) vaccine adjuvanted with AS01, AS03, AS04 or Alum showed that vaccines formulated with AS01 and AS03 induced the highest antibody levels while AS01 promoted best HBs-specific CD4 T cell response [57]. These differences were associated with the magnitude of the initial inflammatory response triggered by the different adjuvanted formulations [57], [58]. Interestingly, although the level of CD4 T cell response was lower in the alum group compared to the AS01 group, both adjuvants led to similar memory subset profiles and cytokine production profiles (polyfunctionality) and neither induced Th2 cytokines nor a CD8 induced response upon peptide restimulation. This indicates that use of alum may not necessarily lead to Th2 skewing in humans. Recently a number of systems biology studies have revealed that specific early signatures (e.g., interferon-dependent pathways) induced by adjuvanted vaccines are often associated with protective responses [59] but the impact of these early signals on functional features of antibodies and the quality of T cell response is not well established yet.",

It was noted that the absence of a Th2 response does not eliminate the risk of enhanced disease.\u2022For vaccine constructs which are already known to induce neutralizing antibody and Th1 responses, it was the consensus of the group that while Phase 1 studies are cautiously proceeding with careful review of safety data, animal studies run in parallel could provide useful information for the further clinical development\u2022Suggestive data in animal models should not by default prevent clinical development of vaccine candidates; potential risk should be thoroughly evaluated by developers and regulators on a vaccine product-specific basis.\n\n",

Because the virus is spreading rapidly, such specimens will allow assessment of the immune response in both seronegative and seropositive persons as both are likely to be vaccinated.\u2022Level of neutralizing antibodies and determination of the relative ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies will be important to assess the potential risk of enhanced disease. Also, detection of initial priming that includes CD8 T cells and/or a CD4 Th1 biased response is likely to mitigate the risk of disease enhancement. Determination of memory responses will be useful, particularly if SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate.\u2022Consideration should be given to the use of post-vaccination sera from vaccinees which could be used for antibody transfer studies in animals to look for enhanced disease and for evidence of cross-protection against other coronaviruses.\u2022Monitoring for enhanced disease in immunized participants may require longer follow-up than is usual in Phase 1 trials but need not delay Phase 2 trials.\u2022Investigators on the call requested frequent updating with both preclinical and evolving clinical data that are being developed by the different academic and industrial developers to help in decision-making about the various vaccine clinical trials. Creation of a central information hub was encouraged for this purpose.\u2022Participants on the call expressed the need for standardization of protocols, data collection forms, critical assays (including reagents) and biobanking of samples from initial clinical trials to allow future re-assay once standards are agreed to and enable comparison of results across trials\n",
