RNA from culture supernatants was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's instructions and used for RT real-time PCR using specific primers for CoV229E N gene (forward: 5\u2032-CAGTCAAATGGGCTGATGCA-3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032-AAAGGGCTATAAAGAGAATAAGGTATTCT-3\u2032) and a probe (5\u2032-CCCTGACGACCACGTTGTGGTTCA-3\u2032) (van Elden et al., 2004). CQ (10 and 25 \u03bcM) inhibited the release of HCoV-229E into supernatants significantly in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). Since CQ has both prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral effects for SARS-CoV (Vincent et al., 2005), its effect on the internalization of HCoV-229E into cells was evaluated. We quantified the HCoV-229E RNA incorporated into the cells at 3h post infection by real-time RT-PCR. The ratios of viral mRNA to 18s rRNA in the reactive units of quantitative real-time PCR were determined. The amount of viral RNA incorporated into the cells was not significantly influenced by CQ (Fig. 1b). These data demonstrate that CQ has no influence on the process prior to the internalization of HCoV-229E into L132 cells.",

Extracted protein (20 \u03bcg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with skim milk and incubated with primary antibodies to phosphorylated p38 MAPK, phosphorylated ERK, p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology), and ERK (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) overnight at 4 \u00b0C.
