            "text": "To increase productivity, the livestock industry is moving to mass operation systems, therefore large economic damage can occur during outbreaks of livestock infectious diseases. Since 2000, in Korea there have been four foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks. During the 2010/11 FMD outbreak, 3.35 million pigs were slaughtered to prevent virus spread, which resulted in a decrease in animals of 32%, while the direct damages, including the costs for farm compensation and preventive measures, reached 3 billion USD and related damages, including costs to feed companies, the decrease in exports, and reduced consumer demand, reached 4 billion USD, as estimated by KREI (2011). Therefore, there is an urgent need to minimise the damage from livestock infectious diseases at the early stages of any outbreak by means of preventive measures. The outbreak of livestock infectious diseases has not be blocked because of the various transmission routes, and tracking of the spread has failed due to the difficulties in field monitoring. There are three routes by which FMD can be transmitted by livestock aerosols and surface contact to respiratory organs (Weber & Stilianakis, 2008); 1) direct contact from infected animal to healthy animals, 2) indirect contact by infected objects such as the human body, vehicles, equipment, feed, refrigerators, and 3) airborne spread through airflow. The airborne spread of livestock disease has not be considered in terms of taking preventive measures due to a lack of information. However, a comprehensive counterplan should consider not only direct and indirect contact transmissions but also airborne transmission via considering the continuously changing airflow patterns from weather conditions.",

Geering and Lubroth (2002) suggested a disease management strategy based on; 1) denying access of the virus to susceptible host animals, 2) avoiding contact between infected and susceptible animals, 3) reducing the number of infected or potentially infected animals in livestock populations, and 4) reducing the number of susceptible animals. Most of the preventive measures used to date have focused on a blockade of direct and indirect transmission of virus regardless of the airborne transmission. Multiple factors should be considered in making preventions and forecasting, but there are a substantial number of difficulties basing this on field experiments, including a lack of basic information on virus spread, the presence of an incubation period, and having a detection problem or a delay in disease declaration.",

Viruses that are suspended in the air exist as fine particles; there are limitations to capturing these viruses when using an air sampler and also to detect a quantitative dose of the virus under field or laboratory conditions. Modelling approaches of airborne virus spread have been developed to get over these limitations. Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2010) suggested an FMD spread model that used seven variables; (1) movement of animals, (2) local spread, (3) infectivity, (4) zones, (5) resources for depopulation, (6) movement restriction, and (7) surveillance. Stevenson et al. (2013) suggested a spatial and stochastic simulation model was developed for epidemiological investigation and considered airborne spread, animal movement, farm operating methods, incubation period, indirect contact, susceptibility, and other factors. Their model calculated the probability of infection by the distance from the infected farms via airborne spread of virus using weather information and look-up tables. However, considerable numbers of quantitative variables relied on expert opinions and required more research.",

Among various simulation techniques, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which solves mathematically aerodynamic problems in various research fields, has been considered. Compared to the Gaussian-based simulation models that are currently used for virus spread simulations, CFD has advantages with respect to specific airflow analysis, complex topographical information and related facilities in a local area that has a concentration of livestock farms (Hong et al., 2011, Seo et al., 2013). Because a considerable number of the livestock facilities in Korea are concentrated in hilly and mountainous areas to avoid complaints from residential areas due to livestock odours, and because there are therefore complex airflows, a CFD approach is very important for analysing airborne virus spread caused by airflow.",

Airborne virus has been known to survive approximately 24\u201348 h in the air, and livestock aerosols generated from farms can carry livestock viruses from an infected farm (Brockmeier and Lager, 2002, Kristensen et al., 2004; Tellier, 2006). The aerosols that are generated from pig farms are suspended on feed particles in the air and are regenerated on a floor surface (Heber et al., 1988, Takai et al., 1998). The particle sizes of the livestock aerosols that are suspended in the air are therefore 2\u20133 \u03bcm (Cambra-L\u00f3pez, Aarnink, Zhao, Calvet, & Torres, 2010); these particles can stay in the air for two days and be dispersed throughout the airflow that is affected by ventilation and weather conditions. The appropriate conditions for FMD viruses be attached to livestock aerosols are >60% relative humidity and <27\u00b0 C air temperature and the survival of the virus is little influenced by the effects of strong UV radiation (Cannon & Garner, 1999). Therefore, livestock aerosols combined with FMD virus can move far away from their source, following air currents when environmental and weather conditions permit virus survival.",

Gaussian based dispersion models were initially used for aerosol modelling and they have been updated to enhance their modelling accuracy by considering the effects of UV radiation, air temperature, virus mortality during airborne phase due to dehydration, and airborne spread (Lighthart and Mohr, 1994). The RIMPUFF (puff diffusion model developed by Ris\u00f8 DTU national laboratory for sustainable energy, Denmark) were also used to predict airborne FMD virus spread (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2001), and complex topographical information was the most important factor for forming virus dispersion patterns when using dispersion modelling (Mikkelsen et al., 2003). To predict airborne virus spread, the RIMPUFF model, which is a regional and large-scale dispersion model, was used with a virus production model (VPM) (Mikkelsen et al., 1997; Thykier-Nielsen et al., 1993). Other cases have been analysed regional aerodynamic dispersion by simulating complex airflow patterns through hills and mountainous regions while considering land utilisation characteristics (Astrup et al., 1997, Mikkelsen et al., 1997). Gloster, Blackall, Sellars, and Donaldson (1981) estimated airborne FMD virus spread from infected farm as point sources by using a Gaussian plume model, and predicted an airborne spread distance of 10 km assuming 108 infectious units per pigs per day; over 65% of the infection was shown to be related to a particle size of <6 \u03bcm. Casal, Moreso, Planas-Cuchi, and Casal (1997) simulated airborne spread of virus using ALOHA (areal location of hazardous atmospheres, NOAA, 1992), which resulted in a 7 km dispersion distance. Donaldson, Alexandersen, Sorensen, and Mikkelsen (2001) mentioned that the airborne dispersion of FMD virus excreted by cows and sheep can be 100\u2013200 m.",

This finding indicates that pigs can emit more FMD virus into the air and that cattle can be infected via airborne FMD spread with a higher probability (S\u00f8rensen, Mackay, Jensen, & Donaldson, 2000). However, these results were established in single animal-oriented laboratory experiments, and there are few studies for addressing FMD virus emission rate at a farm scale. As stated earlier the virus can be spread in the air by attachment to aerosols in a livestock house (Cox et al., 2003, Seo et al., 2013, Treanor, 2004, Wright and Webster, 2001). Using this assumption, it is possible to analyse airborne virus spread in terms of livestock aerosol dispersion using CFD techniques. The emission rate of a livestock aerosol in each livestock building was derived from a previous study conducted by Takai et al. (1998), as shown in Table 2\n, which is reconstituted by inhalable and respirable dust concentrations were measured in a substantial number of farms according to the animal species, animal ages, floor type of the livestock house, and aerosol size.",

The research procedure was divided into five steps.(1)A virus emission calculation algorithm was derived by considering the animal species, characteristics of livestock houses, numbers of animals, and other factors. The calculated emission rates were used as initial conditions for the point sources of FMD-infected farms. The concentration of the virus was considered to produce a standard for forecasting that could help make time for the preparation of countermeasures and strategies to combat the FMD outbreak.(2)The WDAS using AWS data from KMA and the weather station were constructed to provide real-time weather forecasting for prediction of disease spread and past weather information for validating CFD-computed airflow patterns.(3)A CFD simulation model was designed to predict airborne spread of virus. A three-dimensional complex topography was modelled for the Anseong research site based on GIS information. It was necessary to calculate the CFD simulation model as rapidly as possible to enable real-time forecasting of airborne virus spread based on 48-h weather forecasts updated at three-hour intervals and provided by KMA. If all information was simulated at the same time, including the airborne spread and airflow pattern, prompt forecasting would be impossible due to calculation time involved. Therefore, a two-step simulation was conducted to dramatically save on computation time and to maintain result accuracy; first, airflow patterns for eight wind directions and fifteen wind speeds from 0.2 to 3.0 m s\u22121 at 0.2 m s\u22121 intervals were simulated and saved as basic airflow data; then, the scalar transport for airborne virus was modelled from infected livestock farms for next 48 h using the saved basic airflow data.(4)An integrated server system was then constructed to inter-work real-time information that was obtained through steps (1)\u2013(3). Then, CFD simulation was conducted at three-hour intervals to predict airborne virus spread based on the interworking between the specific topography, farm information, and real-time climate forecasting. The time dependent scalar transport of the airborne virus was calculated using preceding data file for calculating airflow patterns according to wind speeds and wind directions.(5)A WebFoS was developed to provide airborne spread of livestock disease pattern, weather conditions, and farm information, focusing on user demands, including farm managers and policy decision-makers acting against preventive measures. The WebFoS was able to support and obtain the past, present, and future weather data and to utilise the basic data for epidemiological investigation, including airborne virus spread, policy decisions, and farm management.\n",

Using the DEM information, a three-dimensional surface for the computational domain was designed with an octagon that has a radius of 11 km, with the research site as its centre (Fig. 8\n). Only one computational domain was considered so as to reduce the error between the other wind directions. A buffer area, 56.6 by 56.6 km in size, extended the boundary of the computational domain to stabilise the inflow and outflow airflow pattern at each boundary and to obtain solution convergence. Without this buffer area, the airflow that started from the mountainous boundary would demonstrate unpractical airflow patterns and wind speeds. Therefore, the buffer area was added by stretching the mountainous area until the height of ground surface had a value of 0 m.",
