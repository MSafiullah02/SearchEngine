Several potential candidate drugs have been tried in COVID-19. From these list of candidate drugs, two anti-malarial drugs came into limelight for following reasons. Initial studies found both chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 effectively in vitro [[1], [2], [3]]. This led clinicians to believe that both drugs may have good potential in the treatment of COVID-19.",

[4] referring to 15 Chinese trials (whose complete results are still not available), claimed benefit with CQ in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease in more than 100 patients. One study from these 15 Chinese trials, conducted by Chen et al. [5] later showed data of 62 patients and found that HCQ significantly improved the clinical recovery (fever and cough) and pneumonia assessed by chest CT scan, compared to the control. However, a close look into this randomized control trial (RCT) found that the endpoints specified in the published protocol differed from those reported. First, the trial was originally supposed to report the results from two different dosage of HCQ on clinical and radiological outcome, although only the report of higher dose HCQ was reported finally. Second, the trial was stopped prematurely [6]. Another study from France, a non-randomized trial of HCQ (n = 36) by Gautret et al. [7] also reported a significant effect of HCQ and HCQ plus azithromycin (AZ) in lowering viral load and viral clearance compared to control as measured by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this study was widely criticized due to the poor trial design, unreliable conclusions, no clinical endpoints, assessments made on day 6 despite a planned 10 days trial, different value of Cycle threshold for RT-PCR, and derivation of results after excluding six patients from the HCQ arm [8]. The publishing journal's society also subsequently declared that the trial by Gautret and Colleagues did \u201cnot meet the Society's expected standard\u201d [9].",

Interestingly, Indian Council of Medical research hurriedly issued a guideline and additionally recommended the use of CQ and HCQ as a prophylactic agent in the close contacts including the health care workers [11]. Surprisingly, based on these emerging developments, US President while addressing the nation on pandemic claimed CQ and HCQ as a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the treatment of COVID-19. The consequence of this announcement resulted in FDA issuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to use both the drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 on March 28, 2020. Historically, this new EUA represents the second time when FDA has ever used any emergency authority to permit use of a medication for an unapproved indication. Earlier, an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir was given similar EUA by FDA during the 2009\u20132010 for severely ill patients with H1N1 influenza. Although later an RCT failed to show any benefit of peramivir in severely ill hospitalized patients with influenza, compared to the placebo. Nonetheless, peramivir is approved only for uncomplicated influenza since 2014.",

For example \u2013 they included number of patients for HCQ plus azithromycin (n = 20) in their analysis, rather than HCQ alone (n = 14), for the denominator for viral clearance. Similarly, the number of patients included for the composite of death or clinical worsening in HCQ arm was also overlooked and mistakenly reported in denominator (n = 20), rather than the actual number (n = 26).

For example, the study by Magagnoli et al. (n = 368) [21] found that there was no difference in the requirement of mechanical ventilator (MV) and death in patients who were on MV. However, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HCQ group (adjusted hazard ratio 2.61, 1.10\u20136.17, p = 0.03), compared to the control. Since this study contributed more than 84% of weight in this pooled meta-analysis of 3 studies, the signal of significant death appears to emerge. Moreover, relatively elderly patients (mean age 68 year) and more sick (moderate to severe COVID-19) patients were studied in Magagnoli et al. study, compared to all other studies. Therefore, the purported benefit of HCQ in early or mild COVID-19 as observed in studies by Chen et al. [5] and Gautret et al. [7] cannot be entirely ruled out, from the result of this meta-analysis. It is also possible that HCQ may have some benefit in early and mild COVID-19 but possibly harmful in moderate to severe COVID-19.",

However, a recent double-blind RCT, Cloro-Covid-19 conducted by Borba et al. [26] hinted of high lethality with the higher dosage of chloroquine (CQ). Higher dose of CQ was associated with 39% death, compared to 15% death in lower dose arm. Fatality rate with high dose of CQ was as high as 60% in patients with underlying heart disease. QTc prolongation was significant in 19% of cases on high dose CQ compared to 11% in low dose CQ arm. Although no signals of torsade de pointes were noted in this trial, it is believed that increase in mortality in this trial could be attributed to the combination of CQ with azithromycin (AZ) and oseltamivir or lopinavir/ritonavir, all of which can prolong QTc interval [27]. Similarly, emerging studies from France and USA have increasingly cautioned for QTc prolongation with both HCQ and HCQ plus AZ. While Bessi\u00e8re et al. [28] reported (n = 40) a prolonged QTc in 93% of the patients receiving either HCQ or HCQ plus AZ; Mercuro et al. [29] reported QTc prolongation (n = 90) in 20% of patients treated with HCQ alone or HCQ plus AZ. These findings underscores the safety of HCQ in the light of negligible benefit observed in some of these studies.",
