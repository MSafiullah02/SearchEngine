Most often, we spend our time and resources in targeting only the human pathogens using small molecule inhibitors with the ultimate goal of developing therapeutic compounds to treat the associated diseases. A missed opportunity, however, is targeting the zoonotic host using small molecule inhibitors with the goal of utilizing the acquired chemical and structural knowledge to inform us of the evolutionary path of the virus on a biological basis. So, we believe that by using small molecule compounds as probes of the structural evolution of viral enzyme drug targets, from the zoonotic reservoirs to the human pathogens, we can gain new insights and predict a priori the structural scaffolds of small molecule compounds that can serve as lead templates for therapeutic development against emerging human pathogenic viruses such as coronaviruses.",

The first two human CoV strains (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were identified in the mid-1960s, and it was not until the 21st century that a new human coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS-CoV) was identified.4, 5 Currently, there are at least six known human CoVs including: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and most recently, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).6 MERS-CoV, formerly known as HCoV-EMC, was identified in November 2012, when it was isolated from the sputum a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian man presenting acute pneumonia and renal failure.7 Since the time of its identification, the virus has grown to be a threat to public health worldwide having a case-fatality rate of about 30%.8 To date, there are no vaccines or antiviral agents capable of preventing or treating any human coronaviral infection.",

These polyproteins are then proteolytically processed at 14 cleavage sites by two essential viral cysteine proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro, or nsp3) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro, also known as the main protease, Mpro, or nsp5). Cleavage by both proteases results in the production of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), where PLpro is responsible for cleavage at 3 sites and 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage at 11 sites (Fig. 1\n). The function of 3CLpro is vital for the coronaviral life cycle, making it an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs.21, 22\n",

Targeting the immediate zoonotic reservoirs of coronaviruses with small molecule inhibitors can help inform structure-based design strategies aimed at creating molecular scaffolds that may also target the emerging human CoVs and ultimately aid in the development of therapeutics against coronaviral infection. Toward this goal, we first expressed, purified, and characterized the kinetic properties of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro. We then determined the inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro by a small library of 230 peptidomimetic compounds, which resulted in the identification of 43 HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, two of which showed sub-micromolar potency. With a potent lead inhibitor compound in hand, we investigated the contributions of its individual sub-structural components to inhibitory potency and identified a favored peptidic backbone for HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibition. Finally, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of the three most potent inhibitors containing this favored backbone in complex with HKU4-CoV 3CLpro and elucidated the structural reasons behind such potent HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibition.",

This screen resulted in the identification of 43 peptidomimetic compounds with inhibitory concentrations ranging from micromolar to sub-micromolar (vide infra). The peptidomimetic inhibitors can be grouped into two classes, inhibitors with a single amide bond in the inhibitor backbone (Class A) and inhibitors with a dipeptide-like backbone (Class B). The results of this screen are displayed in Table 1a\n(Class A) and Table 1b\n(Class B), where only the compounds that showed greater than 50% inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro at 100 \u03bcM are shown (see Supporting information S1 and S2 for comprehensive list of compounds tested). The compounds are listed in the tables in rank order by IC50 values starting with the lowest IC50 value. Of the 25 Class A inhibitors that were tested for inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, 19 were found to inhibit HKU4-CoV 3CLpro above 50% at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, and subsequently, IC50 values were determined. Remarkably, the two most potent inhibitors, 1A and 2A, proved to be sub-micromolar inhibitors of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, having IC50\u2019s of 0.33 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM, respectively. Upon examination of the 19 Class A inhibitors, an immediate trend is apparent where there is an overwhelming preference for a 3-thiophene at the R1 position and a 1-methylbenzotriazole at the R3 position of the peptidomimetic backbone. This is observed in every Class A inhibitor found to produce inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro over 50% at 100 \u03bcM, with the exception of the least active analog in this series, 19A. 19A only differs from the more active compound 6A in that 19A has a triazole in place of a benzotriazole; however, this difference is significant enough to decrease inhibitory potency ten-fold between the analogs, from 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM for 6A to 16.0 \u00b1 4.0 \u03bcM for 19A. Interestingly, 19A maintains a triazole ring in the R3 position, indicating that the position of the nitrogen atoms in this heterocycle is essential for good HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibition. Other R3 heterocycles incorporated in the less active members of Class A include 4-substituted methyltriazoles, 4-imidazoles, and 2-furans, underscoring the importance of the methylbenzotriazole at the R3 position and pointing to the potential significance of a precisely oriented hydrogen bond acceptor (see Supporting information S1 for a comprehensive list).",

The position of the nitrogen is of moderate significance, as a p-substituted pyridine at R2 is 2-fold more active than the m-substituted pyridine (5A vs 11A, Table 1a). Bulky substituents on R2 aromatic heterocycles, such as in 20A, decrease inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, indicating a steric requirement within the R2 binding pocket (Table 1a and S1). Interestingly, 20A is one of only two Class A compound having a 3-thiophene at the R1 position and a 1-methylbenzotriazole at the R3 position that is not a good inhibitor of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro at 100 \u03bcM. Addition of a methoxy substituent to the R2 heterocycle is tolerated (7A and 9A, Table 1a), but does not increase or decrease inhibition significantly, indicating that the addition of another hydrogen-bond acceptor does not further engage the R2 binding pocket and that smaller aromatic substituents can be tolerated.",

As opposed to the R2 amides and aromatics, this may indicate that when an amine substituent is present at the R2 position, it dictates an alternative binding orientation within the R2 binding space that does not lead to such strict steric requirements. Alternatively, the relatively hydrophobic benzyl group of 17A may decrease inhibitor solubility and consequent inhibitor availability, therefore resulting in lower% maximum inhibition and IC50 value than would otherwise be observed. This may also be the case for 21A, where the R2 aromatic ring lacks the nitrogen found in the more active inhibitors 5A and 11A (Table 1a and S1).",

The change in hybridization between an amine and an amide also results in a change in the molecular geometry of the R2 substituent, which may alter hydrogen-bonding properties and introduce additional effects that may be important factors in dictating good enzymatic inhibition.

Interestingly, we found fewer good inhibitors and no sub-micromolar inhibitors of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro among this larger, more substituted dipeptide-like class of compounds (\u223c76% of compounds in Class A (19 of 25 compounds tested) were good inhibitors of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro while only \u223c12% of compounds in Class B (24 of 205 compounds tested) were found to be good inhibitors). This result could be a consequence of the increased steric bulk perturbing the preferred binding orientation of the Class B compounds in the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro binding site. A comparison of similar Class A and Class B inhibitors more clearly elucidates this trend, where the addition of the sterically bulky R4\nt-Bu amide in the Class B compounds decreases HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibition in each instance (S3) (see Table S3 in the Supporting information). For example, the most active Class A inhibitor, 1A, having and IC50 of 0.33 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM and 93% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM, is almost completely inactivated by the addition of the t-Bu amide as seen in the Class B compound 25B, with only 26% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM. Within the Class B inhibitors, there is a preference for the 3-thiophene at the R1 position and a 1-methylbenzotriazole at the R3 position of the peptidomimetic backbone, though it is not as strong as that observed in within Class A (25% of compounds in Class B vs. 95% of compounds in Class A). Among the series where R1\n = 3-thiophene and R3\n = 1-methylbenzotriazole (compounds 3B, 6B, 9B, 16B, 18B, and 21B) small carboxamide groups at the R2 position are favored as observed by the comparison of 3B to 28B and 6B to 27B (see Table S2 in the Supporting information). Possibly, Class B inhibitors with small R2 amides allow for a shift in the position of the inhibitor in the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro binding site to accommodate the bulky t-Bu amide at the R4 position. Again, an R2 amide is preferred to an amine for good inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro (IC50\n = 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM for 3B versus 22.0 \u00b1 7.4 \u03bcM for 21B). Replacement of the benzotriazole within this series with a benzimidazole has dissimilar effects; for example, comparing 19B (Table 1b) to 28B (S2 and S3) where the benzimidazole of 19B has been replaced with a benzotriazole, inhibition decreases from 68% to 34% at 100 \u03bcM, respectively. In contrast, comparison of 23B to 18B shows that substitution of benzimidazole for benzotriazole increases inhibition from 56% to 76% at 100 \u03bcM (Table 1b). Interestingly, only Class B compounds having a para-substituted phenyl ring with an R2 substituent were found to be good inhibitors of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro; compounds with other, non-phenyl rings including cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl, adamantane, and bicycloheptane were not found to be active inhibitors.",

The synthesis of 22A was achieved in two steps. First, alkylation of benzotriazole by reaction with chloroacetic acid and sodium hydroxide yielded the benzotriazoleacetic acid 22 in 50% yield.25 Subsequent coupling of 22 with the commercially available thiophenylmethanamine using EDC produced the desired 1A component 22A in 25% yield (Scheme 1, top). The synthesis of 23A and 24A was accomplished linearly by first coupling p-phenylenediamine with the commercially available thiophenecarboxylic acid using HATU, which resulted in the desired 1A component 23A in 58% yield. Reductive amination of 23A and commercially available thiophenecarbaldehyde using sodium triacetoxyborohydride produced the desired 1A sub-structural component 24A in 81% yield. Finally, 1A was resynthesized according to the literature procedure by coupling 24A with 22 using EDC as a coupling reagent.24\n",

This finding establishes 22A as a minimum component necessary for inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro and suggests it may be used as a scaffold for future fragment based design of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. Interestingly, the work of Wong and coworkers showed that a series of benzotriazole esters, which act as potent, covalent inhibitors of SARS-3CLpro, are also able to inhibit SARS-3CLpro upon replacement of the ester oxygen with carbon, albeit weakly.26 Taken together, these findings may indicate an inhibitory preference for benzotriazoles among coronaviral 3C-like proteases.",

This interaction may be important for good inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro for two reasons. First, comparing 1A and 2A to 22A, where the R2-substituted aromatic ring of 1A and 2A is absent, a greater than 200-fold increase in IC50 is observed for 22A. Second, Class B compounds having non-aromatic substituents instead of an R2-substituted aryl ring were not found to be good inhibitors of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro (vide supra). These data indicate that for low micromolar to sub-micromolar inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, an R2-substituted aryl ring may be required. Furthermore, there is a conserved active site water molecule present in the X-ray crystal structure of each HKU4-CoV 3CLpro-inhibitor complex that mediates a hydrogen-bond between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of His41 and the amide R2 nitrogen of the inhibitor (Fig. 2A, C and E). This finding illuminates the observed preference for an amide substituent at the R2 position in both Class A and B inhibitors.",

The unbound, or free, HKU4-CoV 3CLpro enzyme was found to have noteworthy changes in the active site architecture in comparison to the X-ray crystal structures of the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro-inhibitor complexes. In the absence of an inhibitor, what appears to be a metal ion binds to the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro active site by coordinating to the catalytic cysteine (Cys148), which is rotated 180\u00b0 from the inhibitor bound structures, resulting in a 3.2 \u00c5 positional change in the location of the sulfur atom with a distance of 2.2 \u00c5 between the sulfur of Cys148 and the metal atom. The metal is presumed to be a zinc cation, as it is present in water and likely to bind to a sulfur atom (also seen in PDB ID 2YNA), though it could also be iron. The tele-nitrogen of His41 is shifted 2.6 \u00c5 from its position in the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro-1A-RFL complex X-ray crystal structure, allowing for the coordination of the Zn2+ atom, which is located 2.4 \u00c5 away (Fig. 3A). Additionally, the positions of the Met25, Cys44, Ala46, Tyr54, and Gln192 residues all noticeably shift upon superposition of the free and inhibitor-bound forms of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro.",

The (R)-enantiomer of the Class B compound, 3B, was found in the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro active site, with the backbone of the inhibitor oriented similarly to the backbones of the Class A inhibitors 1A and 2A, utilizing the same hydrogen bonds; however, the (R)-R4\nt-Bu amide substituent of 3B, which is absent in the Class A inhibitors, marginally rotates the thiophene away from Tyr54, increasing the distance to the hydrogen-bond donor Tyr54 from 3.9 to 4.5 \u00c5 compared to 1A, and moving the thiophene out of hydrogen-bonding distance to Tyr54 (distance measured to heteroatoms). The R4\nt-Bu amide of 3B extends out toward the solvent exposed side of the active site, inducing a structural rearrangement of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro where Gln192, which encloses 1A and 2A in the active site, is moved 2.7 \u00c5 to accommodate the steric bulk of the R4 substituent of 3B. The combination of these factors may be attributed for the observed 5-fold increase in IC50 when comparing 1A and 2A to 3B and likely account for the reduced inhibitory activity of Class B compounds relative to Class A compounds.",

These data indicate that the active site architectures among HKU4-CoV, HKU5-CoV, and MERS-CoV 3CLpro may be similar enough to design broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against lineage C Betacoronaviruses and have implications for the structure and inhibition of lineage C Betacoronaviruses yet to emerge. To test this hypothesis, we tested whether our lead HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor, compound 1A, would also have inhibition of HKU5-CoV 3CLpro. We found that compound 1A is a good inhibitor of HKU5-CoV 3CLpro, having 91% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM and a sub-micromolar IC50 value of 0.54 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM which is comparable to the IC50 value of 0.33 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM against HKU4-3CLpro.

Overall, the Class A peptidomimetics were found to be better inhibitors relative to the Class B compounds, and two of the Class A compounds were determined to have sub-micromolar inhibitory potency against HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, 1A and 2A. Analysis of the inhibition data from the 230 peptidomimetics resulted in the identification of a favored inhibitor backbone consisting of 3-thiophene and 1-methylbenzotriazole functionalities. To evaluate the relative contribution of the favored inhibitor backbone to the total HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibition observed for the molecule, we synthesized the sub-structural components of the lead inhibitor, 1A, and tested them for inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro. The simple compound, 22A, which represents the R1 and R3 inhibitor functionalities and consists of the 3-thiophene and 1-methylbenzotriazole of the favored backbone, was found to inhibit HKU4-CoV 3CLpro even in the absence of the anilido and R2 components of the inhibitor. We then determined the X-ray crystal structures of the three most potent inhibitors containing this favored backbone, 1A, 2A, 3B, in complex with HKU4-CoV 3CLpro. These X-ray crystal structures prove that the three Class A and B inhibitors bind in the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro active site, utilizing the same set of three hydrogen-bonding interactions between the favored backbone and the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro active site residues, serving to anchor compounds with this backbone into the active site of the enzyme. Our attempt to solve the X-ray structure of the privileged backbone compound, 22A, in complex with HKU4-CoV 3CLpro resulted in the structure of unbound HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, which is presumably as a consequence of weak inhibition by 22A (28% at 100 \u03bcM). Superposition of the unbound and inhibitor-bound forms of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro revealed several subtle, but important changes in the active site architecture upon inhibitor binding. Furthermore, sequence alignment of HKU4-CoV, HKU5-CoV, and MERS-CoV 3CLpro show that the residues involved in inhibitor binding are conserved, indicating that identification of broad spectrum 3CLpro inhibitors of lineage C Betacoronaviruses is possible. In support of this, we found our most active HKU4-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor to have inhibition of HKU5-CoV 3CLpro in the sub-micromolar range (IC50\n = 0.54 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM). These findings, and the structural details underlying the potent inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro by compounds containing 3-thiophene and 1-methylbenzotriazole backbones, can be used in the future to design compounds with the ability to more fully exploit the HKU4-CoV 3CLpro active site, leading ultimately to the development of more highly potent and selective inhibitors against human pathogens such as SARS and MERS.",

For 1A: 15% PEG-3350, 2% tacsimate, 5% isopropanol, 0.1 M imidazole pH 6; for 3B: 20% PEG-3350, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5; for 2A: 18% PEG-3350, 5% tacsimate, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH5.5; for 22A: 10% PEG-3350, 2% tacsimate, 5% isopropanol, 0.1 M imidazole pH 6.5. Protein crystals appeared between 14 h and 7 days after setting up crystallization plates. Crystals were harvested with a nylon loop, which was then swiped through the same mother-liquor solution supplemented with 15% MPD. The crystals were cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen and stored in shipping dewars containing liquid nitrogen until X-ray data collection at an available synchrotron could be performed.",
