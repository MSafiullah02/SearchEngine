Both approaches require validated assays to evaluate specific antibody responses. Although MERS-CoV serologic assays have been developed (2\u20136), those detecting functional antibodies cannot be applied in all laboratories and can require Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Recombinant protein-based immunoassays are easier to operate and standardize and do not require BSL-3 containment. However, MERS-CoV protein-based assays developed thus far can only detect antibody binding and give no information on antibody functionality. The MERS-CoV spike protein N terminal subunit (S1) contains 2 functional domains: the N-terminal domain (S1A), which binds sialic acid, the viral attachment factor; and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (S1B), which binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the virus receptor (7,8). Antibodies against those 2 domains can block MERS-CoV infection (9). Based on this fundamental knowledge, we developed 2 recombinant protein-based functional assays.",

When this domain was multivalently presented on self-assembling lumazine synthase (LS) nanoparticles (S1A-Np), it was able to hemagglutinate human erythrocytes. To generate S1A-Np, we genetically fused the S1A domain to LS and expressed the particles in HEK-293S cells (Appendix Figure 4, panel A). By using S1A-Np, we developed a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay to detect antibodies capable of blocking virus interaction with sialic acids (Appendix Figure 4, panel B). To set up the assay using turkey RBCs, we tested the ability of S1A-Np to agglutinate turkey erythrocytes by using empty (LS)-Np and S1B-Np as negative controls. Although neither the lumazine synthase\u2013Np nor the S1B-Np showed any hemagglutination at any temperature tested, the S1A-Np induced hemagglutination at 4\u00b0C; we also noted hemagglutination when using dromedary erythrocytes (Figure, panel C; Appendix Figure 4, panel C). Although antibodies against the S1 and S1A domain inhibited hemagglutination showing high HI titers, S1B antibodies were negative for HI (Figure, panel D).",
