The results conclusively show that SCoV E protein has a highly unusual topology, consisting of a very short transmembrane helical hairpin. The hairpin forms an inversion about a previously unidentified pseudo-center of symmetry which seems to be unique to SCoV. Electron microscopy studies indicate that the protein dramatically distorts lipid bilayers, causing tubulation. Taken together, the structure of the protein facilitates a molecular explanation of the effects upon the bilayer curvature underpinning the function of the protein in vivo and may represent the beginning of a concerted effort aimed at inhibiting its function and consequently viral infectivity.",

The peptide was purified and reconstituted into dimyristoylphosphocholine (DMPC) lipid vesicles, to be used for FTIR spectroscopy. The transmission FTIR spectrum of the resulting proteo-liposomes focusing on the amide I vibrational mode (1600\u20131700 cm\u22121) is presented in Figure 3\n(a). Since the amide I vibrational mode arises mostly from the peptidic C=O stretch, its frequency is well correlated with the secondary structure of the protein.16 Peaks resonating at 1655 cm\u22121, 1630 cm\u22121 and 1645 cm\u22121, correspond to \u03b1-helical, \u03b2-strand and random coil peptide segments, respectively.16 The amide I mode of SCoV E protein TMD is centered at 1657 cm\u22121 with a peak-width at half height of 23 cm\u22121, both indicative of the very high helical content of the protein, and the absence of any other secondary structure component.16\n",

The sizes of the helices reflected the high helical content of the protein. Each structure was distinguished by the rotational angle of the two helices with respect to one another, in increments of 20\u00b0, leading to a total of 18\u00d718=324 structures. The tilt angle between the helices was set to 0\u00b0, according to the high degree of orientation found experimentally. The stability of each structure was then determined by a molecular dynamics and energy minimization trajectory. The resulting structures were then compared in order to find regions of the configuration space to which structures from different starting configurations converged.",

The hydrophobic stretch of both hairpin helices is only 11 residues long, which is much shorter than the average of 21 residues.14 At the apex of the hairpin three amino acid residues have their amide carbonyl and amine groups unpaired, surrounded by an aromatic belt. At the other end of the hairpin a cluster of charged residues is located. The distance between these two polar elements is much shorter than the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer. The polarity of both elements is not equal however, whereby the charged residues at the opening of the hairpin predominate. Thus, one can speculate that the hairpin opening is situated at the lipid head-group region of one leaflet. Therefore, the hairpin apex is situated in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, with its aromatic belt (known for its affinity to the polar head group) and unpaired amide groups poised to attract the lipid head-group region. It is this attraction that exerts a deformation force on the bilayer, causing an increase in curvature.",

The orientational distribution (mosaicity) of the highly oriented membranes was measured to be below 0.01\u00b0, as determined by a rocking scan. High resolution reflectivity scans up to vertical momentum transfer qz\u22431 \u00c5\u22121 were taken at the D4 bending magnet beamline of the DORIS storage ring at HASYLAB/DESY, at a photon energy of 11 keV, set by a Si(111) monochromator. The curves were measured with a fast scintillation counter (Cyberstar, Oxford instruments), using motorized collimating slits on the incident and exit arms. The curves were corrected for ring current, sample illumination, and diffuse background (offset-scan).",

The integrated intensity of the first Bragg peak was normalized to 1 for the iodinated SCoV E protein and for the Influenza A M2 curve, while the non-iodinated SCoV E protein curve was properly scaled to the iodinated curve corresponding to the respective scattering signals. Full q\nz-range fits to determine the density profiles on an absolute scale and analysis of all samples at different R.H.% is in progress (Z.K. et al., to be published).",

The crossing angle of the helices was set close to that found experimentally: 0\u00b0.
