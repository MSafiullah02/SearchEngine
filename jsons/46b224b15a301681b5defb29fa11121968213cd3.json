Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 mL of the pharyngeal swab samples by use of the automated NucliSens Extractor (bioM\u00e9rieux). Twenty-five-microliter reactions containing 5 mL of the extracted nucleic acid were prepared with the 1-step Access RT-PCR System (Promega). The first primer set used for amplification was an HCoV-NH/ HCoV-NL63-specific primer described by Esper et al. [1] that had the following modification: a single nucleotide degeneracy was introduced into the sense-strand primer, 5 -GCGCTATGAGGGTGGTTG-YAAC-3 , to accommodate a sequence variation among published sequences of HCoV-NH/HCoV-NL63 strains (the underlining indicates the modification). The amplification program consisted of a reverse-transcription (RT) step of 45 min at 45\u040aC and 2 min at 94\u040aC, to denature the reverse transcriptase; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u040aC, 1 min at 55\u040aC, and 1 min at 72\u040aC; and 10 min at 72\u040aC, for final amplicon extension. The second RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set had broadly reactive primers designed to target highly conserved regions of the HCoV RNA polymerase gene: sensestrand primer 5 -GGTTGGGATTATCC-TAARTGTGA-3 and antisense strand primer 5 -TATAACACACAACACCYTC-ATCA-3 . Amplification reactions were performed as described above, and the following program settings were used: an RT step of 45 min at 45\u040aC and 2 min at 94\u040aC, to denature the reverse transcriptase; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u040aC, 1 min at 54\u040aC, and 1 min at 72\u040aC; and 5 min at 72\u040aC, for final amplicon extension.",

Unlike HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-NL, which were initially identified in cell cultures, HCOV-NH was discovered by screening respiratory tract specimens with molecular probes. These probes targeted the sequences of the replicase 1a gene that are conserved among human, avian, and mammalian CoVs. Therefore, it is not surprising-perhaps it is predictable-that this region of the replicase 1a gene is highly conserved between HCoV-NH and HCoV-NL63. Until full genomic sequencing of HCoV-NH is complete, we believe that it is premature to state that HCoV-NH, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-NL are the same virus. Nonetheless, as we clearly acknowledge in our study [3] , it is likely that these viruses are closely related.",

In fact, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has established no specific guidelines to address the issues of nomenclature and categorization of potentially closely related viruses that have been identified independently [5, 6] .

Furthermore, more than one etiological agent may be linked to Kawasaki disease.
