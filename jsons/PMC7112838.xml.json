            "text": "Dugbe virus (DUGV), a member of the genus Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family, was first isolated in 1964 from the Amblyomma variegatum tick in Nigeria (Causey, 1970). Frequently detected in tick-borne virus surveys in Africa (Guilherme et al., 1996), DUGV is a tri-segmented single-stranded negative RNA enveloped virus and is considered endemic in arid regions (Burt et al., 1996). DUGV is also one of the most common tick-borne viruses found throughout Africa (David-West and Porterfield, 1974). For example, a study in Kenya documented frequent isolation of DUGV from ticks infesting market livestock (Sang et al., 2006). Among the 7 serogroups characterized in the Nairovirus genus (Elliott et al., 2000), DUGV belongs to the Nairobi sheep disease group which includes the Nairobi sheep disease virus, pathogenic to sheep and goats (Davies, 1997) and Kupe virus, the most closely related virus (Crabtree et al., 2009). The genetically and serologically related Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) group, which also includes Hazara virus (Begum et al., 1970), is the other group of importance because of the very high pathogenicity of CCHF virus in humans, leading to fatal hemorrhagic disease in 30% of patients (Swanepoel et al., 1987). In contrast, the pathogenicity of DUGV is relatively low in humans \u2013 a thrombocytopenia case was once described (Burt et al., 1996) \u2013 but in newborn mice the virus is neuroinvasive and lethal (Boyd et al., 2006).",

Thus, the detection of DUGV in field samples of arthropods and animal sera is needed to provide greater understanding of the virus epidemiology. Also, as described for other arboviruses, a rapid, specific and sensitive test is necessary for effective surveillance of new DUGV circulating strains. Currently DUGV identification is based on virus isolation. However, a conventional RT-PCR (Ward et al., 1990) and ELISAs (Burt et al., 1996, Ward et al., 1992) have also been described for specific detection of DUGV in samples. To date, RNA DUGV quantification is not available; therefore a qRT-PCR assay would be useful. The specificity of the assay was also important to discriminate the closely related DUGV, Hazara virus and CCHFV. Nevertheless, since Kupe virus was not sought, a genomic amplification of Kupe virus cannot be excluded. The 16 out of 62 nucleotide differences displayed when the primers and probe were aligned with the Kupe virus sequence suggested that they are not specific for Kupe virus. Of note the nucleotide difference was 18 out of 62 for both Hazara and CCHFV.",

Our field study highlights the value of increased sensitivity because the single positive sample (Z-491) was detected at a Ct of 40.6. Such a low Ct would not have been detected using the conventional RT-PCR. Even if the value was out of the RNA in vitro transcript range, the amplicon amount was sufficient for sequencing.
