Careful patient selection is required and the impact of promoting antimicrobial resistance should be considered. Before prophylactic treatment is undertaken, urine culture and susceptibility testing should be done to ensure that the bacterial UTI has been eradicated. For long-term prophylaxis, a drug that is excreted in high concentration in urine and unlikely to cause adverse effects is selected. Often a fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, or a \u03b2-lactam antimicrobial is chosen. The antimicrobial agent is administered at approximately one-third of the therapeutic daily dose immediately after the patient has voided, at a time when the drug and its metabolites will be retained in the urinary tract for 6 to 8 hours (typically at night). The drug is given for a minimum of 6 months. Urine samples, preferably collected by cystocentesis (not by catheterization because this may induce bacterial UTI), are collected every 4 to 8 weeks for urinalysis and quantitative urine culture. If the sample is free of infection, then prophylactic treatment is continued. If bacterial UTI is identified, active (breakthrough) infection is treated as a complicated bacterial UTI before returning to a prophylactic strategy. If a breakthrough bacterial UTI does not occur after 6 months of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, then treatment may be discontinued and the patient should be monitored for reinfection.",

In additional, in vitro studies suggest that the presence of EDTA-Tris reduces the minimum inhibitory concentration for various antimicrobial drugs.64 In a small study (n =17 dogs, n = 4 with chronic cystitis) daily local infusion via sterile urinary catheter (25 mL EDTA at 37\u00b0C) for 7 days was well tolerated and dogs had negative urine cultures up to 180 days after treatment.64 Additional studies are needed to determine the short- and long-term effects of EDTA-Tris therapy.",

In a veterinary prospective study (n = 26 dogs) evaluating biofilm formation on indwelling urinary catheters, sustained-release varnish of chlorihexidine-coated urinary catheters statistically decreased biofilm formation.69 There are an array of other catheter coatings and modifications to decrease bacterial adherence and biofilm formation that have primarily been studied in a research setting, including silver coating, nanoparticles, iontophoresis, antimicrobials, urease and other enzyme inhibitors, liposomes, and bacteriophages.

This enzyme hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which buffers urine hydrogen ions, forming ammonium ions, increasing urine pH, and increasing dissolved ionic phosphate. In the presence of magnesium, magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) may precipitate around a nidus to form uroliths (Fig. 7\n). Bacteria are incorporated into the urolith matrix, and thus, should be considered complicated UTIs because of poor antimicrobial penetration. Greater than 90% of struvite uroliths in dogs are induced by urease-producing bacteria, whereas struvite uroliths in cats are commonly sterile (ie, not associated with bacterial UTI). Struvite uroliths can be dissolved through a combination of dietary therapy and appropriate antimicrobial therapy; following dissolution or removal, preventing urolith recurrence requires preventing reinfection. For dogs that are uncomfortably symptomatic from urocystolithiasis and/or fail medical management, minimally invasive procedures, such as laser lithotripsy, laparoscopic-assisted cystotomy, or cystotomy, may be considered.Box 5Complications of urinary tract infection\nPotential complications of UTI\u2022Resistant infection\u2022Polypoid cystitis\u2022Emphysematous cystitis\u2022Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) urolithiasis\u2022Pyelonephritis\u2022Prostatitis\u2022Prostatic abscess\n",

Proteus spp may be more commonly associated with development of these lesions.74, 75 Polypoid cystitis lesions are niduses of deep-seated bacterial infection and should be treated as complicated UTIs. In some cases long-term antimicrobial therapy may result in successful resolution of lesions. However, partial cystectomy results in more rapid resolution of clinical signs, is likely associated with improved rates for long-term resolution of infection, and allows shorter antimicrobial treatment courses.75\n",
