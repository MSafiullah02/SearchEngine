A novel coronavirus was isolated and found to be the cause of SARS. The SARS-coronavirus is a new member of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Coronavirus. Some researchers have considered the mutation analysis and phylogenetic analysis. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Phylogenetic analysis using biological sequences can be divided into two groups. The algorithms in the first group calculate a matrix representing the distance between each pair of sequences and then transform this matrix into a tree. In the second type of approaches, instead of building a tree, the tree that can best explain the observed sequences under the evolutionary assumption is found by evaluating the fitness of different topologies.

In addition to problems in multiple alignment (computational complexity and inherent ambiguity of the alignment cost criteria), these methods become insufficient for phylogenies using complete genomes. Multiple alignment become misleading due to gene rearrangement, inversion, transposition, and translocation at the substring level, unequal length of sequences, etc, and statistical evolutionary models are yet to be suggested for complete genomes. On the other hand, whole genome-based phylogenic analyses are appearing because single gene sequences generally do not possess enough information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms.

Graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing, sorting, and comparing various gene structures.
