            "text": "The coronavirus disease caused by the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 3 brought professional life to a standstill for many orthopaedic surgeons around the world. 4 Although some will be given roles to work on the front lines or take on leadership positions 5 during this crisis, many surgeons will act in a supportive or reserve role. This article aims to give 6 a brief outline of the pathogenesis and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and how to safely navigate 7 your practice during and after the pandemic. We will outline recommendations of how to 8 resume clinical operations when restrictions are lifted. 9 Presentation and Incubation 11 As of writing of this manuscript there are over 3 million global confirmed positive 12 COVID-19 cases with over 215,000 deaths; however, the true number of cases has been and will 13 continue to be difficult to ascertain due to the varying nature of how the viral illness presents 14 [1] . Early presenting symptoms of the virus frequently include fever, non-productive cough and 15 fatigue and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms and anosmia [2] [3] [4] . A well-characterized 16 subset of the population contracts the infection with indiscernible symptoms. The average 17 incubation period has been reported to last 14 days, with a median presentation of five days 18 [5, 6] . There have been some reports of patients remaining infectious for over 20 days from 19 symptom onset [5] . Without widespread testing, quantification of this asymptomatic group in 20 the pandemic is nearly impossible to determine [6] . Premature studies have suggested hydroxychloroquine, best known for its role in 46 malaria prophylaxis and rheumatoid arthritis maintenance therapy, and remdesivir, an antiviral 47 that gained popularity during the Ebola epidemic, could be effective in managing the COVID-19 48 disease [10] [11] [12] . While no current randomized controlled trials exist, both medications are 49 currently being investigated in several large clinical trials. Meanwhile, plasma infusion therapy 50 using the separated blood products containing antibodies against COVID-19 from patients who 51 have recovered is a strategy reserved for the most serious of cases [13] . Several vaccine trials 52 are on the horizon with hopes of mass production within the next 12-18 months to promote 53 long term immunity, but further research is still required. their anesthesia colleagues in regards to general or regional anesthesia for infected patients. 153 It is important to remain vigilant during this time of increased infectivity, especially in 154 high-risk environments such as the operating room and intensive care unit (ICU). According to 155 manufacturers, orthopaedic surgical hoods alone are not protective against this virus [13, 19] . 156 All surgeons and operative staff should maintain universal precautions at all times and use N95 157 masks when operating on suspected or confirmed 13, 20] . Covering the 158 N95 with a level 1 approved mask may help to prevent soilage, which then requires mask 159 disposal [13, 19] . Otherwise the N95 can be decontaminated by a variety of methods and then 160 re-used. for our patients. The ability to consistently and promptly identify SARS-CoV-2 carriers will 173 further help to navigate this pandemic. Routine serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 for all patients, 174 and in some circumstances, healthcare staff, is being considered by public health officials.",

            "text": "A timeframe for a normal elective arthroplasty schedule is still being debated. Initially 178 there will need to be a balance between surgical volume to address case backlogs and ensuring 179 orchestration of appropriate hospital support for patients regarding staff and supplies. In 180 addition, availability of operating room PPE and a reliable central processing system are keys to 181 operative consistency. Regular open communication with immediate team members, nursing 182 managers, and hospital administrators will facilitate a safe return to elective cases. 183 The surgeon also needs to facilitate discussions between device manufacturers and 184 hospitals to ensure essential equipment is available. This is of particular importance because 185 many supply chains have been disrupted; implant companies may need additional time to 186 ensure equipment and implants are readily available. During the early return to elective cases, 187 surgeons must remain flexible with operative schedules knowing that case mix may vary for an 188 extended period of time in comparison to previous practice routine. 189 Social distancing practices will likely persist for quite some time after elective cases 190 resume. Patient social support systems will be impacted as we expect most facilities will limit 191 visitors at office encounters and around the perioperative period for an underdetermined 192 period of time as we continue to navigate the viral pandemic. Surgeons should be prepared for 193 the possibility that a patient's family member or support person may not be allowed to enter 194 the facility and their comfort level without a \"coach\" may lead to delay or cancellation of the 195 surgery. These considerations will likely impact the surgeon's normal schedule. Re-opening 196 schedules for elective cases will likely include some additional challenges. guidance on these issues. 216 Lastly, procedures and regulations will vary across different regions of the country and 217 community settings. Areas with lower viral density are more likely to see a faster \"return to 218 normal\" than harder hit regions. By the same token, hospitals and surgery centers in smaller 219 cities that are more remote from larger urban areas may be faster to ramp up their elective 220 schedules. 221 14 An evolution in healthcare is upon us as we learn to navigate this pandemic. Expect the 222 time to resume normal schedules and procedures to be gradual over the next several months. 223 Advances in telecommunication enable surgeons and therapists an avenue to provide 224 individualized patient care from a safe distance. Above all, communication remains essential to 225 meet patient needs and expectations. If a patient requires a face-to-face encounter, 226 appropriate precautions have been outlined to ensure the office visit is safe for all parties 227 involved. Because this respiratory disease is spread via droplet transmission, hand hygiene is 228 the most critical step to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Patience is paramount as we 229 adapt our orthopaedic practices to safely meet the future needs of our patients. ",

Most 58 offices see only patients with time-sensitive conditions including new fractures, suspected59    infection or neurovascular compromise[14]. All patients should be screened prior to entering 60 the office for fever, chills or cough. If positive, they should be issued a mask and sent directly 61 for evaluation per local protocol. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)62    currently recommends all individuals wear a simple mask when in public and to limit touching 63 their face to prevent viral transmission[13]. The mask should cover the nose and mouth to 64 prevent a contagion from infecting others with a compromised immune system. The CDC 65 currently recommends a N95 mask be utilized for known positive COVID-19 patients[3,13].66    Social distancing, which is currently defined as maintaining a distance of six feet from others,67 should continue among staff and patients. Rearranging waiting room seats, limiting the number 68 of patients, coordinating x-ray time slots and terminal cleaning of all essential equipment is 69 required to comply with social distancing regulations set forth by the CDC to help prevent the 70 spread of the virus [13]. 71 Personal protective equipment supply and stewardship will be important for the 72 foreseeable future as reserves will likely remain low for some time in some areas. The proper 73 removal and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be reviewed to prevent 74 inadvertent contamination [13]. Local guidance for use of PPE should be followed. Routine 75 virucidal decontamination of reusable medical equipment/supplies should take place the virus, the individual should be sent home immediately and plan to quarantine 87 until symptoms resolve [3,13]. Hospital infectious disease specialists have outlined viral testing 88 protocols that can vary among facilities; therefore, we encourage surgeons to check with their 89 affiliated hospital. Current return-to-work standards as outlined by the CDC include [13prophylactic measure, staff with risk factors for contracting the virus should be encouraged 94 to work remotely from home if possible. The recommendations are frequently updated to maintain some degree of revenue generating productivity. These 101 include real time audio-visual telemedicine visits, audio alone telephone visits, and e-visits 102 using patient portals. There are a number of regulatory and compliance matters specific to 103 virtual healthcare at the federal and state levels, as well as payer specific rules [16,17]. 104 Providers should be familiar with these before initiating such modalities. Of note, there have 105 been recent relaxations aimed at encouraging virtual healthcare at the federal level, state level, 106 and among payers. Many of these are temporary and tied to the pandemic, including those 107 from the Department of Health and Human Services [16,18]. Given the evolving climate, offices 108 should maintain a source document, log concerning compliance, and remain vigilant office telemedicine visits are 99201-99215 for new and established patients 111 and require real-time audio and video [16]. Billing can be determined by medical decision 112 making (using 1995/1997 guidelines) or total provider time on the day of service, including 113 preparation, and should append a 95 modifier to comply with the recommended billing 114 practices [16]. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services has also provided relaxed 115 telemedicine regulations around a number of other visit types, including hospital and 116 emergency department based codes [16,17]. If your practice does not use a major third-party 117 electronic health record (EHR) vendor with a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 118 (HIPAA) compliant option for video-based telemedicine, video conferencing applications such as 119 Facetime, Doxy.me, and Zoom are readily available. Enforcement discretion has been announced for HIPAA compliance in connection with telehealth care during the COVIDcan be completed via smartphone, tablet, or computer. Audio-only 125 visits for those patients who are unable to access audiovisual platforms are an acceptable form 126 and some payers allow for use of 99201-99215, however Medicare will not [16]. Appropriate 127 evaluation/management codes for audio-only visits are 99441-99443 and depending on the 128 amount of time spent on the telehealth consult with the patient [16,17]. RVU Values for these 129 codes are less than the telemedicine codes. Appropriate patient evaluation, documentation, 130 and coding of these telemedicine visits can be reviewed in the American Association of Hip and 131 Knee Surgeons Webinar -Telemedicine and Total Joint Surgeons: How to Run a Virtual Practice 132 (https://aahkszoom.s3.amazonaws.com/Telemedicine/webinar-telemedicine-04142020.sensitive urgent and emergent cases [14]. The operating room can be a high-risk 138 environment during the current pandemic, particularly if intubation is required, as the virus can 139 become aerosolized. Most of these recommendations have been learned from prior 140 experience with aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 [2,4,5]. The COVID virus has not been isolated in 141 bone or marrow, which is particularly relevant to orthopaedic surgeons using high-speed burs 142 and saws [12, 19]. To further protect trainees, the ACGME has recommended medical students, 143 residents, fellows and other support staff should only be utilized in the operating room if 144 absolutely necessary to prevent viral exposure [20]. 145 All team members should don an approved gown, gloves, eye protection, and N95 mask 146 prior to contact with an active COVID-19 patient [19]. It is currently recommended that only 147 essential members of the anesthesia team are present in the operating suite at the time of 148 intubation. To prevent potential exposure, the surgical team should enter the operative suite 149 only after the airway is secured and an allotted amount of time to allow air exchange within the 150 operative environment. Most air handling systems can exchange the air in 15 minutes, but this 151 should be confirmed with your hospital's engineering department [21]. Surgeons should consult 152",

            "text": "161 As mentioned previously, there are subsets of the population that have increased risk of 162 morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease [2-6]. Patients that have surgery during active 163 infection or become infected shortly after surgery are another identified high-risk population 164 [4,22]. A recent retrospective cohort study from China summarized their early operative 165 outcomes on this population [22]. Their findings are consistent with current thoughts 166 suggesting that older individuals with multiple co-morbidities are at higher risk of 167 complications. Surgery on these patients, like a high-energy trauma patient, seems to initiate a 168 \"second-hit\" phenomenon that can induce a systemic inflammatory response. Operating on a 169 patient with COVID-19 can have grave consequences with nearly 44% requiring ICU care after 170 surgery and a mortality rate up to 20% [22]. As surgeons, we will need to maintain open 171 communication between the other members of the medical team to provide coordinated care 172",

This is in part to the extra time for required for cleaning and preparation protocols 205 including proper room sterilization procedures, air filtering protocols after intubation and 206 limited availably of support personnel. Furthermore, the patient volume and post-anesthesia 207 care unit throughput will also be a hindrance as the ramp up initiates. 208 At the start, joint replacement surgeons may want to focus on routine primary cases 209 and gradually introduce more complex cases over the next several months. Some entities have 210 suggested that high volume revision cases may place undue strain on PPE supplies, operating 211 equipment sterilization, and staff social distancing practices. Complex cases will likely require 212 lengthy hospital stays which increase risk of patient exposure to the virus [23]. In addition, 213 larger cases carry a higher likelihood of ICU admission in a time when acute care beds and 214 ventilators are in short supply.

It is believed that up-25 regulation of ACE2 during infection combined with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,26    angiotensin receptor blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or 27 thiazolidinediones can potentially predispose patients to a myriad of complications including, 28 cardiac arrest, impaired ventilation, and death[7]. In addition, current research has found 29 increased mortality in patients with multiple comorbidities including older age, obesity, existing 30 pulmonary diagnoses, and diabetes[6][7][8]. Additionally, hypertension may also be associated 31 with an increased risk of both contracting symptomatic COVID-19 and hospitalization[7].Currently, patients contracting the virus have a mortality rate between 4-7% which is nearly 33 four times that of the influenza virus[2,4]. This close contact disease is spread via respiratory 34 droplets which can enter the respiratory tract via mucosae or conjunctiva[8,9]. Transmission 35 can also occur through fomites within the immediate environment of an infected person[8].At this time there is no proven or accepted treatment for patients with COVID-19.Current management strategies for ~80% of cases includes symptomatic treatment focused on 40 hydration and fever control (antipyretics)[2]. Intensive care monitoring and ventilator support 41 are reserved for severe cases. The current trend is to review the efficacy of available 42 therapeutic drugs in hopes of improving outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
