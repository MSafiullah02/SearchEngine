At the World Health Assembly in May, 2012, the BRICS countries \u201cstressed the importance of universal health coverage (UHC) as an essential instrument for the achievement of the right to health [and] welcomed the growing global support for UHC and sustainable development\u201d.2 But how do the BRICS countries measure up to national commitments to achieve UHC? Building on recent national studies of UHC efforts3, 4 (as well as country series published in The Lancet for Brazil, India, China, and South Africa), in this paper we review, assess, and compare UHC efforts in each of the BRICS countries. Because there is not yet a standard, internationally agreed quantitative framework to measure progress towards UHC, in this analysis we review national data and present a qualitative analysis of efforts to reach UHC in each of the BRICS countries.5\n",

To achieve this target, Russia needs to not only modernise and offer effective care, but also reinvigorate efforts for health promotion. This effort will require additional financial resources; however, compared with 2012, public funding in the 2013\u201316 budgets increases spending by only 4%. Gross domestic product (GDP) spent on health is expected to decrease from 3\u00b77% in 2012, to 3\u00b74% in 2016.25 Related to this fact is the regional distribution, variability in resources, and broad income inequalities.26 Per-head public health funding has differed between four and five times between regions, and this difference has increased in the past decade. There are considerable divergences in access. According to a 2003 survey, patients receiving free inpatient care without any additional payment ranged from 74\u00b72% to 55\u00b77% in different regions.27\n",

However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth rate, India, has had the least improvement in public funding of health services. Future research to understand why there have been such different levels of prioritisation of the health sector in China and India could be useful. Brazil, Russia, and South Africa have all had far lower economic growth rates, and all face opposition to increases in public spending on health because of the present economic crisis.

Although the BRICS formation was initially based on macroeconomic interests, the BRICS countries have the potential to be important leaders on a range of social policies. In view of South Africa and Brazil's previous commitments to UHC, through the Foreign Policy and Global Health group and within discussions on the post-2015 agenda for health,56 the BRICS group will probably also focus on and advocate for UHC. The latest BRICS Health Communiqu\u00e9 supported the recent UN resolution on UHC, and stated the countries are \u201ccommitted to work nationally, regionally and globally to ensure that UHC is achieved\u201d.57 If they are not leading by example in making progress, it will be of little value for BRICS to individually and collectively advocate for UHC. The BRICS countries must succeed in moving towards UHC, not only because they account for nearly half the world's population, but also because they serve as important role models for other countries within their respective regions. In view of this opportunity to expand influence further through UHC and the chance to exchange and share learning on how to best achieve UHC, it seems likely that as the BRICS Ministers of Health Group continues to meet, they will increase their focus on UHC.",
