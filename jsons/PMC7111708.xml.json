            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection causes severe enteritis accompanied by highly contagious in pigs (Garwes, 1988, Penzes et al., 2001). TGEV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of 28.5 kb, belonging to the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales (Eleouet et al., 1995\n). The genome consists of a 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and 3\u2019 UTR, arranged in this order, with three accessory genes 3a, 3b and 7 interspersed within the structural genes at the 3\u2032 end of the genome (Putics et al., 2006, Yount et al., 2000). TGEV circulates in pig farms and has been known to mutate, resulting in the S gene deletion mutant now recognized as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Kim et al., 2000, Wang et al., 2010, Wang and Zhang, 2015). It also provides the virus backbone which, in combination with the S gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), has generated the recently described chimeric viruses termed swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs) (Belsham et al., 2016). This frequent evolution poses a huge threat to the pig industry.",

            "text": "Virus invasion always triggers an inflammatory response, which is a key mediator of the host response against microbial pathogens (Shrivastava et al., 2016). To monitor and rapidly respond to diverse viruses, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are appointed to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and subsequently induce the production of inflammatory mediators with a two-step process: priming and activation (Poeck and Ruland, 2012, Rietdijk et al., 2008). The priming step is mediated primarily by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or RIG-like receptors (RLRs): TLRs recognize specific viral motifs within the endosomal compartments, then recruit the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptors, including myeloid differentiation primary response gene (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF); RLRs recognize cytosolic viral RNA, then interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF) leading to the recruitment and activation of mitochondria associated complexes (Fukata and Arditi, 2013, Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2009, Takeuchi and Akira, 2010, Tschopp and Schroder, 2010, Yamamoto et al., 2003). In addition, the stimulator of interferon gene (STING, also known as MITA) has also been identified as an adaptor involved in the RLR pathway (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008). The activation step is mainly mediated by cytosolic PRRs including nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), and pyrin that initiate assembly of the appropriate inflammasome components where receptors recruit apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) proteins and caspase-1 complexes that are required for the secretion and bioactivity of priming step-produced cytokines (Dutta et al., 2015, Latz et al., 2013, Man et al., 2016, Vajjhala et al., 2014, Yu and Levine, 2011).",

NF-\u03baB is essential in priming inflammasome activation for production of cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and also of pro-IL-1\u03b2 (Lan et al., 2012, Li and Verma, 2002). The NF-\u03baB family is comprised of five mammalian members: RelA (p65), RelB, cRel, p50 (NF-\u03baB1), and p52 (NF-\u03baB2) (Ghosh et al., 1998). A heterodimer composed of p65 and p50 is the most frequently activated form of NF-\u03baB, interacting with inhibitory kappa B (I\u03baB) molecules in resting cells (Malek et al., 1998). The classical NF-\u03baB activation cascade is initiated by stimulus-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, releasing NF-\u03baB dimers and promoting their nuclear translocation. As a result, transcription of various NF-\u03baB target genes involved in the inflammatory response are activated, such as IL-6, IL-8, RANTES and TNF-\u03b1 (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008).",

Thus, inflammatory injury to intestinal tissue caused by an overactive immune response is a hallmark of TGEV pathogenesis. Additionally, TGEV-infected cells showed enhanced NF-\u03baB activity and high expression of genes associated with inflammation, including RANTES, CCL2 and CXCL16 (Ma et al., 2014), thus suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in the pathogenicity of TGEV. However, the mechanisms utilized by TGEV to induce NF-\u03baB and inflammatory responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we confirm that TGEV infection enhances NF-\u03baB activation and induces expression of molecules associated with inflammation including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and RANTES in porcine kidney (PK)\u221215 cells. We further analyzed the underlying mechanisms and found that TGEV-activated inflammation mainly depends on the RLR pathway and downstream adaptors MAVS and STING.",

To this end, PK-15 cells were transfected with a NF-\u03baB-Luc reporter plasmid and the internal plasmid pRL-TK, followed by infection with TGEV at different multiplicity of infection (MOI). At 24 h post infection (hpi), cells were collected for dual luciferase activity analysis. As shown in\nFig. 1A, TGEV infection significantly increased the activity of the NF-\u03baB-dependent promoter in a dose-dependent manner. We also analyzed NF-\u03baB-dependent promotor activity at different time points after TGEV infection (MOI=0.1). Enhanced NF-\u03baB-Luc activity was detected as early as 12 hpi and continued to increase at 24 hpi and 36 hpi (Fig. 1B). However, this activation was not observed in cells treated with UV-inactivated TGEV (equivalent to 0.1 MOI) (Fig. 1A). These results indicated that TGEV infection could activate NF-\u03baB, and this ability required viral replication. We also tested whether transcription factors IRF3 and AP-1 can be activated after TGEV infection. Similar to NF-\u03baB, TGEV infection activated AP-1 (Fig. 1C) and IRF3 (Fig. 1D) in PK-15 cells.",

Therefore, the expression level of I\u03baB\u03b1 and phospho-p65 were necessarily detected after TGEV infection in PK-15 cells. At different times postinfection, mock- and TGEV-infected cells were lysed and assayed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against I\u03baB\u03b1, phospho-p65 and total-p65. TNF-\u03b1-treated cells were used as a positive control, and PK-15 cells treated with 0.1 MOI UV-inactivated TGEV were used as a negative control. In addition, a specific monoclonal antibody against TGEV N protein was used to monitor viral replication status. As shown in\nFig. 2A, the expression of phospho-p65 was increased to 6 fold at 24 hpi in TGEV-infected cells compared with the mock-infected control, and kept 12 fold increase at 36 hpi. Accordingly, TGEV infection induced degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 to various degrees throughout the time course, with this being most apparent at 36 hpi. However, UV-inactivated TGEV failed to stimulate I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation or p65 phosphorylation, indicating that it is not viral particle but live TGEV infection activates NF-\u03baB. Recent study reported the pathogenicity of TGEV is strongly associated with inflammation (Regla-Nava et al., 2015). We compared the ability of virulent and attenuated TGEV to activate NF-\u03baB. PK-15 cells were infected with virulent or attenuated TGEV for 36 h, followed by western blot analysis with antibodies against I\u03baB\u03b1, phospho-p65, total-p65.

To this end, PK-15 cells were pretreated with BAY11-7082, a NF-\u03baB-specific inhibitor, at different doses (1, 2, 5, and 10 \u03bcM) or left untreated, but subjected to an equal volume of DMSO, for 1 h, followed by inoculation with TGEV (MOI=0.1). All tested doses of BAY11-7082 used in the present study had no detectable cytotoxicity in PK-15 cells, determined by MTT assay (data not shown). After incubation for 1 h, the supernatant was removed and replaced with cell culture media containing different doses of the inhibitor BAY11-7082.RT-qPCR was performed with total RNA collected from different cell samples at 24 hpi. As shown in\nFig. 3A, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and RANTES mRNAs were significantly upregulated in TGEV-infected cells at 24 hpi, compared with the mock-infected group. Furthermore, the effects of TGEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression were reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor. We also determined the virus titers after treatment with BAY11-7082 and found that the inhibitor did not significantly affect virus titers at any recorded timepoint (Fig. 3B), indicating that the effect observed above was due to a decrease in NF-\u03baB activation, rather than the inhibition of viral replication.

In the present study, we describe for the first time the underlying mechanisms of NF-\u03baB activation in response to TGEV infection, and identified that this activation was mediated by the RLR pathway.",

RIG-I primarily senses vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Kato et al., 2008, Kato et al., 2006, Loo et al., 2008, Nakhaei et al., 2009, Sumpter et al., 2005); MDA5 mainly detects picornaviruses and the dsRNA analog polyinosine-polycytidylic aid [poly(I:C)] (Kato et al., 2006, Wies et al., 2013); RIG-I and MDA5 function redundantly in the detection of Dengue virus and West Nile virus as well as paramyxoviruses (Kato et al., 2006, Loo et al., 2008). In addition, some viruses can up-regulate the expression of RIG-I and MDA5. For example, RIG-I expression levels are rapidly increased upon Sendai virus or influenza virus infection; encephalomyocarditis virus infection or poly(I:C) treatment also increase the expression of MDA5 (Wies et al., 2013). We observed in this study that TGEV infection boosted both RIG-I and MDA5 expression, which indicated that TGEV can be sensed by both RIG-I and MDA5, thus amplifying RLR-mediated proinflammatory cytokines to perpetuate the immunopathology progress. RLR inflammasomes regulate RNA virus-induced proinflammatory cytokine production via two mechanisms: (1) RIG-I and MDA5 can recruit MAVS, triggering caspase-8 and Fas-associated death domain protein activated-NF-\u03baB for production of proinflammatory cytokines; (2) RIG-I and MDA5 can also bind ASC and thereby trigger caspase-1-dependent inflammasome activation via a NLRP3-independent mechanism (Loo et al., 2008, Poeck and Ruland, 2012). Further studies are required to define the detailed mechanism(s) involved in TGEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production.",

However, MDA5 seems to have a greater effect than RIG-I on sensing TGEV, since silencing MDA5 more severely impaired NF-\u03baB activation than did knockdown of RIG-I. It is known that RIG-I preferentially recognizes non-self RNA sequences containing 5\u2019 triphosphorylated (5\u2019ppp) ends or short dsRNA, while MDA5 can bind long dsRNA molecules with blunt ends (Hornung et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2008). Coronaviruses can modify their mRNA 5\u2019 structures by encoding several nonstructural proteins (nsp) with RNA capping activity to evade innate immune recognition, such as nsp14 (N7-methyltransferase) and nsp10/16 complex (2\u2019-O-methyltransferase). Therefore, MDA5 is regarded as an important sensor for recognizing coronaviruses.",

It has been reported that NF-\u03baB inhibitors may be effective as antiviral agents against influenza virus, functioning mainly by reducing virus titers (Pinto et al., 2011, Wiesener et al., 2011). Intriguingly, treatment with BAY11-7082 had no impact on TGEV replication in PK-15 cells, a phenomenon which has also been described for human coronaviruses infecting the respiratory tract, such as pandemic SARS-CoV (DeDiego et al., 2014). Theoretically, it would be expected that a reduced antiviral response should lead to an increase in viral replication, ultimately resulting in higher virus titers. However, if TGEV-induced inflammatory cytokines could not reach the minimal concentration necessary to affect TGEV replication, it is not surprising that an effect on virus titers was not detectable. TGEV infection also promotes IFN-\u03b2 production and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, but this is much lower than the concentration required to inhibit viral replication (An et al., 2014, Becares et al., 2016, Zhu et al., 2017). However, NF-\u03baB inhibitors remain potential therapeutic drugs against TGEV, being associated with reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and alleviated inflammation-induced pathology.",

However, TGEV-encoded protein behavior in inflammation regulation is still unclear. Regarding other coronavirus, the SARS-CoV N protein activates IL-6 expression through NF-\u03baB by facilitating the translocation of NF-\u03baB from the cytosol to the nucleus or by binding directly to the NF-\u03baB element on the promoter (Zhang et al., 2007). The SARS-CoV S protein up-regulates IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression in murine macrophages, or IL-8 in human peripheral blood monocyte macrophages (Dosch et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2007). The PEDV E protein up-regulates IL-8 expression, which is associated with NF-\u03baB activation (Xu et al., 2013). As for TGEV, protein 7 could reduce inflammatory changes after TGEV infection (Cruz et al., 2013), but no inflammation agonists have been reported. Further study is required to determine whether other TGEV-encoded proteins could regulate inflammation, especially homologs of glycoproteins implicated in other coronaviruses, which are also viral PAMPs and would be detected by PRRs for downstream cascade transduction (Chang et al., 2004, Tang et al., 2012). Defining these issues is important for better understanding of TGEV-induced inflammatory responses.",
