Some studies have claimed that rib fixation can also decrease ventilator dependence [7, 8], but others have considered this claim to be controversial [9, 10]. The results might vary depending on the surgical approach used during rib fixation. In our hospital, we combine VATS and rib fixation in severe blunt chest injuries with ARF. In our previous study, we found that rib fixation exhibited some benefits in patients without respiratory failure [11]. In this study, we hypothesize that rib fixation with VATS could provide a better outcome in intubated patients with ARF. The two study periods overlapped. However, the patient groups were not the same. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this approach on the length of ventilator use and length of hospital stay.",

In the ICU, ventilators with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were used for fully sedated patients.

Because all patients were under sedation, patients\u2019 closest relatives were informed of the treatment plans by trauma surgeons. The main treatment goal is to decrease the ventilator-dependent days. VATS for pleural collection and rib fixation for chest wall stability are two primary treatment methods. Patients whose relatives agreed to rib fixation with VATS were enrolled in group 1, and those who only agreed to VATS without rib fixation were included in group 2. These family members provided consent for the procedures. The treatment algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 2.\n",

In patients who received rib fixation, VATS was also first used to treat the pleural and lung parenchyma lesions. The surgical wound incisions were then designed according to the fracture sites of the ribs that were localized using VATS (Fig. 1b). The fractured sites were approached using the chest wall muscle-sparing method [16\u201318]. Titanium plates with locking screws (MATRIXRIB\u2122, products of DePuy Synthes, companies of Johnson & Johnson) that were specifically designed for fractured ribs were selected and applied at the outer surfaces of the ribs (Fig. 1c).

            "text": "All patients in this study received VATS within 6 days after trauma [19]. The time periods from trauma to operation were equal between the two groups, without statistical significance. In this study, a total of 17 (27.9%) patients received lung repair during VATS. The proportions of patients receiving lung repair in the two groups were similar (Table 1). Lobectomy procedures were not performed in this study. After rib fixations, most patients with ARF could be weaned off the ventilator within 4 days or much faster than VATS-only patients (3.19 \u00b1 3.37 days vs. 8.05 \u00b1 8.23, P = 0.002). The total ventilator-dependence time durations were also much shorter in the rib fixation group (7.71 \u00b1 3.65 days vs. 12.55 \u00b1 8.22, P = 0.002). A patient was defined as having high PEEP if pressure was greater than 5 cmH2O. Patients in group 2 required significantly more days of total ventilator use (5.71 \u00b1 3.65 vs. 10.55 \u00b1 8.22, P = 0.013). Eight patients had prolonged ventilations that required a tracheostomy; all these patients belonged to group 2 (0 vs. 20.0%, P = 0.042). Because of early weaning from the ventilator in the rib fixation group, the rate of pneumonia was also much lower (38.1% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.005). The time of chest tube use after the operation was also shorter in the rib fixation group (6.33 \u00b1 2.13 days vs. 8.75 \u00b1 4.04, P = 0.003). Because of early weaning from the ventilator and shortened periods of chest tube use, the LOSs in the ICU and hospital were both shorter in group 1, with statistical significance (8.81 \u00b1 3.40 days vs. 12.08 \u00b1 4.95, P = 0.008; 17.76 \u00b1 8.38 days vs. 24.13 \u00b1 9.80, P = 0.011). In this study, all patients had normal consciousness upon discharge. The pain scores at discharge were much lower in the rib fixation group (3.57 \u00b1 1.03 vs. 5.18 \u00b1 1.40, P = 0.001). Table 2 illustrates all clinical outcomes after operations on patients with ARF.\n",

Initially, fractured ribs were not the main target of treatment in our hospital [23]. In fact, fractured ribs, especially the bicortical fractured type, can produce an unstable thoracic cage that might not support the full expansion of lung parenchyma. Although positive pressure ventilation can provide a supporting force for lung expansion, long-term ventilator dependence may be required to wait for the chest wall to heal. Many orthopedic materials have been designed specifically for fractured ribs. Several studies have successfully proven that reconstruction of a chest wall using rib fixation could reduce ventilator dependence [16, 24, 25]. In contrast with other studies, we performed rib fixation combined with VATS to completely manage chest wall injury, lung laceration, and pleural collections. These two procedures can be performed simultaneously to accelerate ventilator weaning. The rate of ventilator-acquired pneumonia subsequently decreases, which may also shorten the whole course of treatment.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that VATS should be performed within 1 week after trauma [19]. We thus adhered to this principle in this study. All patients received VATS within 6 days after trauma. The rates of empyema for the two groups are similar without statistical significance. Group 1 patients had rib fixation added during VATS to enable the reconstructed chest wall to maintain a firm structure. A stable chest wall can allow patients with lung parenchyma to retain full lung capacity without long-term use of the high PEEP ventilator mode. This benefit could decrease the probability of barotrauma for alveoli. The earlier the expansion of lung parenchyma occurs, the earlier the ventilator weaning can occur.",

The numbers of patients with ARF are small for thoracic injuries because only 5 to 10% experience incidences after blunt chest trauma. However, in this study, we attempted to include a sufficient number of patients for the calculation power to reach 0.8. The other limitation of the study was that patient selection was not randomized, although the study protocol was designed prospectively. Because all patients were initially intubated and sedated after trauma, all decisions regarding operation were made by patients\u2019 families. We considered that all patients in this study should receive fixation but that consent should be obtained from families. Although we provided detailed information regarding rib fixation, some family members did not understand our explanations. Therefore, we could only provide their families with choices to inform their final decisions. However, this condition provided a comparison group for the study. Although the two groups were not matched initially, which may have caused selection bias, the demographic characteristics of the two groups exhibited no statistically significant differences. The binary logistic regression examination also indicated a high correlation between rib fixation and the length of ventilation use after adjustment for other variances. Another limitation of the observation-based data was that different staff members recorded the observations. To mitigate this limitation, a senior surgeon reviewed all data for accuracy and consistency. All surgical procedures were performed by the same team, and the same surgeons were responsible for all decisions to perform rib fixation to avoid surgical confounding bias. The pain score evaluation comparison between the two groups was also a limitation in this study. In addition to the subjectivity of pain sensation, group 2 patients had longer ICU stays that may have interfered with pain scores. Fortunately, all patients in this study were lucid and conscious, decreasing the potential for such bias.",
