Recommendations may not be appropriate for every institution and may change as the current situation evolves. The goal of these guidelines is to highlight specific considerations for patients with COVID-19 on an individual and population level. Any airway procedure increases the risk of exposure and transmission from patient to provider. In such a rapidly escalating pandemic, the aim in treating patients with COVID-19 disease is to maximize the likelihood of recovery for the greatest number of patients as quickly as possible in a way that minimizes the risk to the provider. In these rapidly-changing times, the \u201cstandard\u201d of care may not be one to which providers are accustomed, but the authors feel that it is critical to apply and carefully adapt the best existing evidence on this topic to the current pandemic.",
