While IMV may be lifesaving in this setting, it is associated with significant short- and long-term side effects. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing strategies such as extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R), which can facilitate CO2 removal [1], or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which, in addition, provides oxygenation in instances of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure [2]. These approaches may enable reductions in the intensity and/or the duration of IMV in these patients.",

Amato et al. showed that lower driving pressure was the physical variable that best correlated with survival in patients with ARDS [10]; higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), lower peak and plateau pressures, and lower respiratory rate, may also be associated with improved survival [11, 12].",

The rationale to integrate ECCO2R into the management of severe ARDS is to allow more protective ventilation, i.e., providing very low tidal volumes (VT) (less than 6 mL/kg PBW) with conventional MV, while avoiding extreme levels of respiratory acidosis. Arterial CO2 tensions are generally maintained in the range 45\u201360 mmHg rather than targeting normocapnia with this approach [16]. The potential for use of ECCO2R in patients with ARDS has been evidenced in a number of clinical studies [17\u201319], indicating it may be an effective strategy in ARDS management and a viable option to further reduce tidal and minute volumes in these patients [15, 16].",

Use of NIV has been reported to reduce mortality by approximately 70% [21]; however, in some patients, additional assistance is required to prevent the need for intubation [22]. NIV fails in almost 40% of cases, and patients must undergo endotracheal intubation and IMV to restore adequate gas exchange [22\u201325]. There is increasing clinical evidence supporting the use of low-flow, partial ECCO2R for patients experiencing aeCOPD who are failing support with NIV [22], avoiding the need for IMV and/or decreasing the length of time on the ventilator [26].",

Here, we describe a newly developed ECCO2R device, the PrismaLung+ (Additional file 1: Figure S1), created specifically for CO2 removal. We compared the in vitro CO2 removal rates during low blood flow (QB 200\u2013450 mL/min) of three devices: PrismaLung+ (Baxter), PrismaLung (Baxter), and Eurosets A.L.ONE (Eurosets), and during a QB of 600 mL/min for the PrismaLung+ and A.L.ONE devices [29\u201331]. We hypothesized that PrismaLung+ with a membrane surface area of 0.8 m2 provides significantly higher CO2 removal rates than PrismaLung (surface area 0.35 m2), whereas we expected similar performance for PrismaLung+ and the A.L.ONE device (surface area 1.35 m2), since with increasing membrane surface area, the low blood flow rates limit CO2 removal.",

The test circuit comprised a central reservoir filled with 200\u2013300 mL of blood as well as two loops. The control loop had a gas exchanger connected to a CO2 supply, which was used to achieve the targeted pinCO2 levels. In addition, a blood warming system, where the blood warmer bag was submerged in a water bath, was used to maintain blood pool temperature at 37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. The control loop was fed through the central reservoir then connected to the test loop in which the test device was attached, and CO2 removal was determined. Loss of water due to evaporation through the membrane and into the sweep gas was balanced by infusion of reverse osmosis water.

            "text": "Devices with reduced blood flow requirements will, by design, be less efficient at removing CO2 than higher flow devices, but they do have several advantages. The PrismaLung+ device in this study has a design tailored to specifically remove CO2. The lack of a need for a heat exchanger inside the device allows for reduced size and weight, given that a heat exchanger is available for use next to the machine during treatment. The new PrismaLung+ device has the lowest ratio of blood volume to membrane surface of the tested devices reducing the risks associated with large extracorporeal blood volumes. The removal of the heater also allows for a streamlined design, which should reduce the potential for pooling and low flows of blood within the device. Further aspects of the device design, including the fluid path and dimensional parameters, have been developed to enable an intended operating blood flow of 200 to 450 mL/min. Namely blood flow velocity distribution was calculated to avoid stagnant areas or areas with very low blood flow velocity and to ensure that channeling of the blood did not occur. The residual volume space is smaller than other devices, minimizing the space for blood to clot. The ratio of CO2 removal rate to blood volume of the PrismaLung+ device allows for optimized performance at these flow rates. It has been shown that an extracorporeal CO2 removal rate of 51 \u00b1 26 mL/min was associated with an increase in PaCO2 from 43 \u00b1 8 to 53 \u00b1 9 mmHg when applying low tidal volume ventilation (VT = 4 mL/kg) in patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS [43]. Whereas a mean CO2 removal of 81 \u00b1 9 mL/min enabled a reduction in VT to 4.29 \u00b1 9 mL/min without an increase in PaCO2 of more than 10% [19]. Therefore, larger CO2 removal rates are desirable to allow ultraprotective ventilation in ARDS patients without a significant increase in PaCO2. Furthermore, it is assumed that a reduced interaction between blood and foreign material, i.e., a preferably small device, may potentially support biocompatibility [44]. The streamlined design of Prismalung+ might require less anticoagulation, which entails a lower risk of bleeding complications in patients, as there is less potential for pooling and low flows of blood within the device. This hypothesis needs to be investigated in future studies.",

A second advantage is that they may be integrated with other organ support strategies familiar to critical care physicians and nurses, such as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), making these approaches much more feasible in the busy critical care environment. The potential to integrate ECCO2R into continuous renal replacement circuits may improve the risk/benefit ratio for hypercapnic patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) [45]. If effective, such devices could also be used in patients that do not have AKI, given the familiarity of the critical care team with this equipment. A feasibility study demonstrated that the use of a low-flow ECCO2R device managed with an RRT platform easily and safely enabled very-low-tidal-volume ventilation with moderate increase in PaCO2 in patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS [43].",

            "text": "In this study, the new PrismaLung+ device performed similarly to the A.L.ONE device, with both devices demonstrating CO2 removal rates ~ 50% greater than the PrismaLung device. While the increase in CO2 removal observed with PrismaLung+ compared with PrismaLung can, at least in part, be explained by an increase in membrane surface area from 0.35 m2 to 0.8 m2, the similarities observed for PrismaLung+ and A.L.ONE occurred despite an increase in surface area, suggesting a more complex explanation. Recent data from Karagiannidis and colleagues suggest that the capability of different ECCO2R devices to eliminate CO2 is dependent upon a dynamic interplay within the device between the surface area available for gas exchange and the blood flow rate [44]. Devices with gas exchange membrane surface areas ranging from 0.35 m2 (e.g., PrismaLung) up to 1.3 m2 (e.g., A.L.ONE) are currently used in clinical practice [19, 22, 26, 46\u201348]. Furthermore, recent in vitro and in silico studies suggest that CO2 removal rate can increase with increasing blood flow rate [49, 50], in line with the observations we report here. Our study also confirms the findings from Karagiannidis and colleagues [44], as both surface area and blood flow rates govern the rate of CO2 removal; however, an increase in the surface area above a certain threshold has limited impact on CO2 removal when low blood flows are applied, as is the case with the A.L.ONE device. Larger membrane surface areas are thought to result in greater levels of CO2 removal at higher blood flow rates, with a smaller pressure drop across the gas exchanger [44]. In our in vitro study, pressure drop values across the three devices were relatively low, with levels of up to 25 mmHg with PrismaLung+ (surface area 0.8 m2) at a blood flow rate of 450 mL/min. Some challenges do exist for devices with larger membrane surface areas and those that require larger priming volumes, as they may have increased thrombotic potential due to increased interaction with an artificial surface [44]. A lower blood flow rate combined with a larger surface area may lead to more clotting events due to the increased time blood spends passing through the membrane [43, 51]. Furthermore, in the clinic, larger priming volumes can negatively affect exposure time and the hemolysis index [51], potentially resulting in increased blood loss due to clotting events and the device having to be replaced. We did not observe clotting events; however, this was not a focus of the study and would require investigation in the clinic.",

The A.L.ONE device is designed to run at higher blood flow rates than the flow rates used in this study; therefore, conditions perhaps did not favor the CO2 removal rate of the device, despite the high surface area in comparison with PrismaLung+ [31].",

It should be noted that as the blood was obtained from healthy animals, levels of blood components will be different from those for ICU patients; however, levels were consistent across experiments. Furthermore, a high dose (5 U/mL) of heparin was used that is higher than that routinely used in the clinic; this dose was selected to ensure no clotting occurred during transportation from the slaughterhouse and during the in vitro experiment and is not expected to impact CO2 removal. Given the in vitro nature of the data, caution should be exercised when translating these data to the clinical setting, and further studies are needed to explore coagulation in the clinic.",
