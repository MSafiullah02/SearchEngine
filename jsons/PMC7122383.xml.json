Chest radiography should be performed on presentation and usually reveals pulmonary infiltrates. Lack of visible infiltrates may be secondary to dehydration, neutropenia, or early presentation. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive in determining the presence of pulmonary infiltrates and may be indicated if the presence of complications such as effusion, empyema, or adenopathy is suspected. Microbiologic data are used as supportive evidence for the diagnosis of CAP and may aid in the determination of appropriate treatment. Sputum Grams stain and culture have been traditionally viewed as low yield but can be quite helpful.3 Identification of an organism along with sensitivity data can help physicians tailor antimicrobial therapy. In patients who require intubation, an endotracheal sample can be easily obtained. Inability to obtain an adequate sputum sample should not delay therapy. In addition to sputum cultures, blood cultures should be performed in patients with severe CAP. Blood cultures can reveal the infective organism even when sputum cultures are negative. Blood cultures are most helpful when drawn prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy.\nDiagnostic work-up of severe CAP should includee a sputum culture and blood cultures.\nCultures should be drawn prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy to increase their yield.\n",

Patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP requiring ICU level of care will often present with respiratory failure and septic shock requiring intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilatory support. There are subsets of patients, however, who do not meet these \u201cmajor\u201d criteria and may still require treatment in an ICU. The 2007 joint IDSA/ATS consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults endorse the use of the CURB-65 or Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) in conjunction with sound clinical judgment to guide site of care decisions.\u00a7 Use of the CURB-65 criteria (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, low blood pressure, age \u226565) will generate a severity of illness score. Patients with scores \u22652 require intensive therapy, likely in an ICU setting. The PSI consists of 20 different variables in an attempt to quantify illness severity that is then linked to an appropriate management setting (outpatient treatment, brief inpatient observation, or more traditional inpatient therapy). The benefit of the CURB-65 criteria is its ease of use; however, it is not as well validated as the PSI. The 2007 IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines outline consensus criteria to define severe CAP in an attempt to predict ICU admission needs.\u00a7 The presence of septic shock requiring vasopressors and/or mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation are absolute indications for ICU admission. These are considered the major criteria in their model. Minor criteria were developed based on previous prediction models in an attempt to define those patients with an increased risk of death. The minor criteria consist of the CURB-65 criteria minus the age delineation. In addition, they also include several other indices: a PaO2/FiO2 ratio \u2264 250, the presence of multilobar infiltrates, the presence of leukopenia, and the presence of hypothermia. The threshold for ICU admission, using these criteria, is the presence of any one major criterion or at least three minor criteria.\u00a7\n",

In critically ill patients with CAP, empiric therapy is broad and use of multiple antimicrobials is often necessary. Recommended standard empirical regimens should include coverage for the three most common bacterial pathogens, all of the atypical organisms, and most Enterobacteriaceae spp.\u00a7 The patient\u2019s history will dictate whether other organisms need to be considered and, if so, what appropriate alterations to empiric therapy need to be made.

Published data on this topic do not provide a clear answer concerning the utility of steroids in this clinical setting. A study published in 2002 showed that adjunctive dexamethasone use in patients with pneumococcal meningitis improved outcomes by reducing both complications and mortality.6 As such, current recommendations include the use of steroids as a treatment modality. Dexamethasone should be used empirically when there is suspicion for or a possibility of S. pneumoniae infection, and continued if confirmed with results from CSF Grams stain or blood cultures.\u2020 The beneficial effect of steroids is seen only when administered prior to or with the first dose of antibiotics. On the other hand, a 2007 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Sub-Saharan Africa did not support the routine adjunctive use of corticosteroids in the management of patients with suspected ABM.7 In this area, pneumococcus is the primary pathogen, and an overwhelming proportion of patients included in the trial were HIV-positive.7 The causal relationship for these findings is unclear, but could potentially have implications for HIV-positive patients in developed countries as well. Results from a similarly conducted study performed in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis in Vietnam illustrated a beneficial effect in those patients with microbiologically proven disease.8 In this trial no difference in outcome was seen in the comparison of all patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.8\nIn cases of suspected pneumococcal meningitis, steroids should be administered before the first dose of antibiotics.\n",

In brief, an infectious stimulus or one of its byproducts triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokine mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-8), which initiates a systemic inflammatory response. Initial hypotheses regarding sepsis suggested that unimpeded proinflammatory responses contributed to the clinical features of this syndrome. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that sepsis results from derangements in the host immune response, i.e., an imbalance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor receptor antagonist).9 In such an uncontrolled inflammatory milieu, other mechanisms such as redistribution of regional blood flow, reduction in oxygen supply, oxidant injury, and alterations in intermediary metabolism contribute to tissue ischemia and injury, resulting in organ dysfunction. The difference between sepsis and SIRS lies only in the precipitating stimulus; in SIRS, the initial insult is thought to be noninfectious.\nAn infectious stimulus triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interleukin-8.\n",

Findings from the history, physical examination, and initial diagnostic work-up usually lead to a presumptive diagnosis and guide the initial choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy (Table 32-8). Any uncertainty about the cause of sepsis, site of infection, or type of pathogen justifies the use of aggressive broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the current era when resistant pathogens are a more common entity. As would be suspected, an increase in mortality is observed in patients who receive delayed or inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. The ideal scenario is to start antibiotics very early in sepsis (immediately after obtaining all cultures) and then identify the cause of the infection and mechanically address the issue if necessary (drainage, surgery, etc). Unfortunately, not all patients present early in the course of their disease, and many progress to septic shock and require extensive supportive therapies despite adequate antimicrobial coverage. While vasopressor therapy, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement interventions have a clear role in the management of severe sepsis, other interventions are still at question. The recent international guidelines suggest the use of corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock, treat hyperglycemia with intravenous insulin therapy, and possibly use colloids for resuscitation.\u2021 However, findings from recent large multicenter trials demonstrated no consistent measurable benefit of these interventions on sepsis mortality11,12 and that using pentastarch (a colloid) should even be avoided.

Initial therapy for patients diagnosed with early-onset HAP or VAP and without any risk factors for infection with MDR pathogens should include coverage for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus aureus (MSSA), and antibiotic-sensitive enteric gram-negative bacilli (see Table 32-11).\u00a7\u00a7 Antibiotics recommended for empiric therapy in this clinical situation include ceftriaxone, a respiratory fluoroquinolone, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem. Late-onset disease carries an increased risk of infection with MDR pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, ESBL K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and MRSA. These patients who are at risk for pneumonia caused by MDR pathogens should be initially treated with broad-spectrum combination therapy until further culture data are known.\u00a7\u00a7 The 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines suggest the use of an antipseudomonal cephalosporin or a carbapenem or \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor plus an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside plus linezolid or vancomycin as initial empiric therapy in late-onset HAP and VAP (Table 32-11).\u00a7\u00a7 Choice of specific agents should be based on the presence of risk factors for MDR pathogens, as well as the local microbiology and antibiogram. Combination therapy is recommended, at least initially, to provide a broad-spectrum empiric regimen that is likely to provide at least one active drug against the MDR etiologic agent. Broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should eventually be tailored to each individual patient based on clinical and microbiologic data. The optimal duration of therapy is not known; however, it has been shown that in patients with VAP, appropriate antimicrobial treatment for 8 days is as clinically effective as treatment for 15 days. In addition, shorter duration of treatment may reduce a patient\u2019s future risk for infection with increasingly resistant pathogens.15 Unfortunately, even with the correct choice of antibiotics, overall mortality from nosocomial pneumonia remains substantial (25\u201350%)13; hence, prevention of such infection will have the greatest impact on the outcome of hospitalized patients.",

Although colonization is thought to be a prerequisite for development of a line infection, it does not present with local or systemic signs of infection. Second, catheter-related infections may present as: (1) an exit site infection (local [<2 cm from catheter exit site] cellulitis and abscess formation), (2) a tunnel infection (local signs of inflammation or infection >2 cm from catheter exit site along tract of tunneled catheter), or (3) as a catheter-related bacteremia.

Within 24\u201348 h of catheter insertion, a fibrin sheath forms around the intravascular surface of the catheter.

Fibrin sheath formation and adherence of bacteria to catheters is related to the smoothness and thrombogenicity of the catheter, which varies among the different types of catheters. Contamination of the hub from inappropriate handling or blood draws and infection of the dermal tunnel from migration of organisms along the subcutaneous tunnel are common causes of catheter-related infections. Lastly, catheter-related infections can rarely be caused by contaminated infusates.\nThe most common cause of catheter-related bacteremia is dermal tunnel infection due to migration of organisms from contaminated or endogenous skin flora.\nSkin colonization at the insertion site is strongly associated with catheter-related bacteremias.\n",

Avoiding multilumen thrombogenic catheters and using cuffed or bonded catheters with antiseptics or antimicrobials will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catheter-related infections.

Avoiding frequent interruptions to the delivery system, especially with total parenteral nutrition, minimizes risks of contamination. Changing catheters routinely over a guidewire does not prevent line infections; in the presence of dermal tunnel colonization or infection, this practice does not sterilize the tunnel.

            "text": "\nThe answer is C. Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a fulminant fatal process, especially if recognition of the disease and institution of therapy are delayed. Often, there is concern about potential brain herniation if a lumbar puncture is performed in patients who have mental status changes and unsuspected brain masses; therefore, most clinicians obtain a CT scan before doing the lumbar puncture. However, CT scan of the brain is never considered a valid reason to delay antimicrobial treatment in patients suspected to have ABM. Lumbar puncture with fluid analysis is necessary in this scenario, but treatment with appropriate antibiotics should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is suspected and after obtaining blood cultures. It may be true that this patient needs ICU care, but that should not delay the work up and treatment of ABM.The answer is C. This patient has developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia that has led to clinical deterioration in the setting of antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection. Although the patient may have an inadequately treated urinary tract infection, he has worsening respiratory status and a chest radiographic finding suggesting a nosocomial ventilator-acquired pneumonia. The patient\u2019s new infection is likely due to a resistant organism; therefore, to continue his daily antibiotic regimen with cefotaxime while waiting for culture and sensitivity is inappropriate. Although some clinicians advocate the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage on protected specimen brush cultures, it is an accepted practice to obtain sputum and blood cultures while waiting for culture and sensitivity results and change to antimicrobial treatment to include treatment for MRSA and Pseudomonas.The answer is B. The patient developed signs of sepsis and deteriorated, despite improvement of his pneumonia. His sepsis work-up should include C. difficile toxin assay because of the diarrhea. Other sources of infection may be his urinary tract, central indwelling catheter, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or meningitis. Endo\u00adcarditis should be suspected if he has a new cardiac murmur or persistent bacteremia. The change in mental status in this patient is likely related to sepsis, and although CT scan of the brain and lumbar puncture may be required, other antibiotics should be added to clindamycin to treat his new sepsis. Indiscriminate use of antidiarrheals without first ruling out infection in a patient with fevers may lead to severe complications, including toxic megacolon. Intra\u00advenous fluids with potassium supplementation would be appropriate in this patient with profuse diarrhea. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be helpful in diagnosing pseudomembranous colitis. In this patient with aspiration pneumonia, empiric metronidazole and stool analysis for C. difficile toxin are most appropriate.The answer is B. At this early stage of presentation, the source of this patient\u2019s sepsis syndrome is unclear although catheter-related infection is likely. As such, a complete diagnostic work-up is warranted to search for the source of infection. Given her hemodynamic instability, broad-spectrum coverage should be initiated. Given her TPN dependence, she is at risk for associated fungemia and use of antifungals should be considered. Fluconazole alone would not be adequate as she should receive empiric coverage for bacterial pathogens. While she may require ICU admission and vasopressor agents, and possibly even PICC line removal, but most important should be empiric treatment for her sepsis syndrome and diagnostic work-up.The answer is D. This man is presenting with pneumonia. His illness is severe enough to have led to respiratory failure. The presence of gingival disease and alcohol use raise the question of possible aspiration and, with it, possible anaerobic infection. Given this patient\u2019s recent hospitalization, he is at risk for infection with hospital-acquired pathogens. Clindamycin alone, while covering possible anaerobic infection, would not treat for a nosocomial infection. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam will cover anaerobes as well as common potential causative organisms of nosocomial pneumonia (including MRSA and Pseudomonas) and is the indicated treatment in this clinically unstable patient. Attempts should then be made to make a microbiologic diagnosis with blood and sputum cultures to tailor therapy.\n",
