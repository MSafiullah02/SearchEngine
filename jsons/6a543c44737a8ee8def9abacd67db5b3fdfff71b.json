In this context, we first explore how deliveries from online shopping have been changing over time. From our analysis of the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we found that online shopping has been embraced by increasingly diverse households, although income, education, and some racial/ethnic differences persist. Our analysis of the 2017 American Time Use Survey shows that Americans are 24 times more likely to shop for groceries in stores than online. Moreover, in-store grocery shoppers are more likely to be female and unemployed, but less likely to belong to younger generations, to have less than a college degree, or to be African American. The gender imbalance in grocery shopping is larger online than in stores, but e-grocery shoppers do not otherwise differ from the general population.",

Moreover, e-shopping in a given sector can differ widely even between countries that are culturally and economically similar. Indeed, despite an average annual growth of 18.7% between 2000 and 2016 (US Census Bureau, 2018a), e-commerce sales of food, beer, and wine 1 in the United States represent currently only 0.35% of total food and beverage purchases (US Census Bureau, 2018b). By comparison, online sales made up 5.3% of total food retail sales in the UK (Office of National Statistics, 2018), which outlines the need to study e-grocery in the United States, even though this topic has already received much attention elsewhere, especially in Europe.",

Our first purpose is to understand changes between 2009 and 2017 -two years selected because of data availability -in residential deliveries from online shopping in the United States. We focus on residential deliveries because national data on grocery deliveries from online purchases in the United States are not, as far as we know, publicly available. Understanding residential deliveries from e-shopping is clearly important to logistics managers (so they can supply warehouses serving residences), to transportation engineers (so they can maintain residential roads and adequately update their design), and to transportation planners (so they can mitigate the externalities of changing freight flows and accommodate new delivery options). Better quantifying the traffic and environmental impacts of residential deliveries from online shopping is particularly of concern because soaring uncoordinated deliveries will increase residential traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution, and exacerbate parking shortages in dense urban areas.",

Grocery was an early target because it is the single largest retail sector, most consumers shop for groceries frequently, and many do not particularly enjoy it (Saunders, 2018) . Proponents argued that e-grocery would give consumers the freedom to shop at the time and from the place of their choosing, expand consumer choice, and stimulate competition by facilitating price comparisons. Convenience and time saving were seen as major advantages at a time when women's participation in the labor force was rising (Morganosky and Cude, 2000) . E-grocery pioneers were technology companies eager to leverage their knowledge of information technologies to take over what they saw as an underachieving sector (Saunders, 2018) . Companies like Webvan (founded in 1996) and HomeGrocer.com (started in 1997) rode the dot.com bubble. They attracted large investments to buy warehouses, delivery vans, and marketing campaigns, and built from scratch purely online businesses. However, when consumer demand failed to meet expectations, investments dried up with the burst of the dot.com bubble and they went bankrupt (Webvan purchased HomeGrocer.com in September 2000, and it filed for bankruptcy in July 2001) (Grunert and Ramus, 2005; Saunders, 2018) . Partly as a result of these failures, online grocery shopping has been called \"the Bermuda Triangle of ecommerce\" -a place where investments vanish without leaving a trace (McDonald et al., 2014) .",

By decreasing the cost of exchanging information, ICT may weaken agglomeration forces and promote the emergence of decentralized, smaller urban centers (Ioannides et al., 2008) . However, concrete evidence that internet use (and in particular eshopping) has impacted urban structure is still lacking (Ioannides et al., 2008) , possibly because it takes years to substantially change the structure of an urban area, but also because of the complexity of the changes induced by ICT, and more particularly by e-shopping (Nahiduzzaman et al., 2019) . While we can expect to see a shift in demand from retail space to warehousing or other types of storage space, the magnitude of that shift is still uncertain. It may be amplified, however, with the widespread adoption of self-driving technologies, which are expected to substantially cut the cost of freight transportation (Wadud, 2017; Andersson and Ivehammar, 2019) . This shift may be less important for e-grocery than for e-shopping in general. It will also depend on the dominant form of grocery (e.g., click-and-pick vs. home deliveries) and on the extent to which grocers adopt omni-channel strategies, where the business processes of multiple retail channels are increasingly integrated (Marchet et al., 2018) .",

This entails ensuring delivery during tight time windows while observing adequate temperature requirements, the ability to promptly respond to demand, and having enough information to avoid failed home deliveries due to a customer's absence (Punakivi and Saranen, 2001) , all of which are issues that delivery service companies or the postal service typically do not face. A number of options have been proposed to manage the demand for grocery deliveries based either on time slot allocations or time slots pricing, either in static (i.e., forecast-based) or dynamic (i.e., real-time) settings (Agatz et al., 2013; Klein et al.

In 2009, the sample frame was obtained using random digit dialing of landline phone numbers, but this approach is no longer appropriate because since 2016 over half Both the 2009 and the 2017 NHTS inquired about the number of times each respondent purchased something online and had it delivered in the 30 days preceding their survey day.

To account for this relatively high percentage of zeros, we estimated mixture models (Greene, 2011) , which assume that our samples are composed of two distinct groups of households. Households in the first group never purchase goods online, and therefore get no deliveries from online shopping. Households in the second group make online purchases from time to time, so the number of their deliveries is modeled via a count model. To model the probability of belonging to either group, we relied on a logit model. The resulting mixture model can be written (Greene, 2011) :",

Overall, the likelihood to never order online has decreased for most household types, and especially for households with 2 or more retired adults (-0.305**). These households are now less unlikely than baseline households to shop online, possibly because older adults with a spouse are more likely to use modern information technologies (Vroman et al., 2015) . However, differences in deliveries have sharpened The importance of the generational structure of households has also been changing, suggesting a broader adoption of online shopping. In 2009, an increase in the number of household members from younger generations (Gen X and Gen Y, and to a lesser extent Baby Boomers) sharply reduced the likelihood of never shopping online. Furthermore, increasing the number of household adults raised the number of deliveries. By contrast, in 2017, the magnitude of model coefficients for Gen X and Gen Y decreased. As Baby Boomers aged, however, they became more likely to never order goods online (0.371***), although not as much as members of the Silent generation (1.028***). As Parment (2013) ",

Apart for members of the Z generation who are less likely to shop for groceries, there are no generational effects. Likewise, the number of household children does not matter, and neither does household income, except for members of the highest income group (0.184*). As expected, grocery shoppers are more likely to be \"unemployed\" (0.303***), likely because they take care of the household while other household adults are at work and homemakers (still usually women) are consider unemployed. Interestingly, people with less education are less likely to shop for groceries. Race matters but only for African Americans, who appear to shop for groceries less frequently than other groups, which agrees with previous findings that African Americans have less access to supermarkets (Morland et al., 2002; Beaulac et al., 2009) . To compensate, poor people in predominantly black neighborhoods or in poor rural areas tend to shop at dollar stores 4 (Whalen, 2018) , and rely more on fast food outlets (James et al., 2014) .

In particular, households with more adult female members receive significantly more deliveries, and so do households with higher incomes and higher educational achievements.

If, however, last mile deliveries are coordinated, performed as part of existing daily deliveries (e.g., via the US Postal Service), done by bicycle or electric vehicles, and/or go to lockers or neighborhood convenience stores (as is commonly done in Taiwan 5 , for example), their external costs could be much reduced (e.g., see Moore, 2019 online in the 2017 ATUS, even though this survey gathered data from a representative sample of over 10,000 Americans (unfortunately only over a single day each), which reflects the current lack of popularity of online grocery shopping in the United States.
