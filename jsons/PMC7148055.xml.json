            "text": "In this paper, we define and solve a novel academic search task, called aspect-based retrieval, which is targeted towards enabling the academic search user to specify the aspect along with the query to retrieve a ranked list of scientific articles that are (i) relevant to the query, and (ii) the relevance relation [3] between the query and retrieved documents is semantically close to the specified aspect. We illustrate this expected behavior with a concrete example: consider the query autoencoder and an aspect of interest, say, application, then we aim to rank high the articles which are related to the concept of autoencoder and are about the applications of autoencoders. If there were two papers, titled (a) \u201cComplex-valued Autoencoders\u201d and (b) \u201cExploring autoencoders for unsupervised feature selection\u201d, our system should rank the paper (b) higher than paper (a) since it specifically deals with applications of the specified query rather than its variants. Note that both papers are indeed relevant to the central concept being queried. Aspect-based retrieval of scientific documents is not straightforward at all since the relation semantics do not manifest as simple keyword matches. Simply expanding the query with terms that define the aspect fails to retrieve relevant articles. In the above example, the paper (b) does not contain the application in the title as well as the abstract. On the other hand, a document, titled \u201cEvaluating the Performance of Dynamic Database Applications\u201d is not related to the query RDBMS along the application aspect although its title contains the term applications. The way in which the specified semantic relationship manifests between the query and a document is highly dependent on the domain we operate in. For example, given the query autoencoder, for a document to be related along application aspect, the presence of terms like feature or selection with terms similar to application would be highly suggestive because feature_selection is known to be an application of autoencoder. But this can not be easily determined by just analysing the documents without prior knowledge of the domain.",

The query and aspect models are derived using domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs), which is challenging in itself due to the inherent sparsity of relations in these KBs. By using a domain-specific KB of computer science, like TeKnowbase [14], we show how to overcome the sparsity issue in KB via inference using meta-paths derived from the KB. Our results over the Open Research Corpus [1] dataset containing more than 39 million published research papers show that our proposed approach outperforms variants of query likelihood language models with/without relevance feedback.",

We chose 10 queries and retrieved the top 10 documents for them using the standard query likelihood model. Additionally, we fired queries of the form \u201cquery+aspect\" to retrieve the top-10 documents using the same model. We recruited evaluators to annotate about 1500 documents with the aspect labels (described in details in Sect. 3.2). In order to increase the size of our document set, we used heuristics to collect more documents given an aspect. We formulated a query containing only the aspect as a keyword and retrieved documents for it using the standard likelihood model. But, we retained only those documents which contained the name of the aspect in the title on the intuition that such documents are highly likely (though not guaranteed) to be about those aspects.

The entities connected via application relation in TKB have a higher probability of appearing in documents addressing application aspect. However, TKB is sparse. To automatically infer the entities participating in a particular relationship type, we used meta-paths. A meta-path is a sequence of edges with labels connecting two nodes which have been used previously for KB completion tasks [6], link prediction [8] as well as to find similarity between two nodes [11, 13]. Figure 1 shows how meta-paths can be used to infer relationships between entities.\n",
