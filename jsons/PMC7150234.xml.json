SARS rapidly spread via Hong Kong to the rest of Asia, North America, and Europe within a few months, affecting 8437 patients with a mortality rate of 9.6%. In May 2005, SARS was declared \u2018eradicated\u2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO), thus becoming the second human disease, after smallpox, to receive this label. Coronaviruses isolated from civet cats and other game animals in China have remarkable sequence homology with SARS-CoV, suggesting a zoonotic origin.",

Practically, prerequisites for the diagnosis of SARS include the presence of an epidemiological linkage, rapidly progressive pneumonia resistant to standard treatment, clinical features, and virological evidence of SARS-CoV infection. An epidemiological link, defined as a history of contact with a SARS patient or visiting a hospital with nosocomial SARS outbreak, in the 10 days preceding disease onset, is useful even for patients in areas with outbreaks. Virtually all patients deteriorate despite potent antibiotic therapy (Tsang et al., 2003), and most have lymphopenia and raised transaminase levels.",

About 60% of patients dropped their hemoglobin by 2 g dl\u22121 after treatment with ribavirin (1.2 g tid) for 2 weeks, and higher doses were associated with elevated liver transaminase levels and bradycardia (Booth et al., 2003). The rapid recovery of the first few Hong Kong patients had led to the adoption of the above as standard anti-SARS regimen in Hong Kong and elsewhere in 2003. Ribavirin is now considered to be ineffective. The efficacy of other possible anti-SARS-CoV agents such as antiproteases like Kaletra (ritonavir 400 mg and lopinavir 100 mg for 14 days), in combination with ribavirin as initial treatment, was associated with reduction in mortality (2.3% vs 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs 11%) when compared with historical controls (Chu et al., 2004). It appears, therefore, that ritonavir/lopinavir could be considered for early treatment of SARS patients, preferably in a controlled clinical trial setting. Adverse reactions are not infrequent and include severe pancreatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, asthenia, headache, nausea, insomnia, and skin rash.",

Despite skepticism, immunomodulating drugs could be considered as rescue therapy. Patients who had pulse steroid therapy (e.g., methylprednisolone 250\u2013500 mg daily for 3\u20135 days) did not have higher cumulative steroid dosage or side effects, but had less oxygen requirement and better radiographic outcome, than their counterparts (Ho et al., 2003). Although a retrospective analysis showed a higher 30-day mortality among patients who had pulse methylprednisolone, this could be due to the higher likelihood of using such therapy in more severe SARS cases. Corticosteroids are effective anti-inflammatory agents that significantly reduce interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IFN-\u03b3 inducible protein-10 levels in SARS (Wong et al., 2004). The use of high-dose steroids was associated with sepsis, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, and even systemic fungal infection. Approximately 15% of SARS patients had MRI-proven avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hips and knees (Griffith et al., 2005), which could be steroid-induced, but this incidence seems much higher than that among recipients of organ transplants despite similar steroid dosages.",
