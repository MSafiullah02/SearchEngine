There, the information comprised in the sequence of their building blocks can be exploited for the over-expression of a desired protein, for the down-regulation of endogenous gene expression, for bypassing or even repairing endogenous genetic defects or for activating the innate immune system. Very substantial progress has been made with establishing and optimizing delivery systems for nucleic acids. After almost 50 years of research and development, dating back to the first uses of nucleic acid delivery in virology research [1], [2] and the first visionary concepts of gene therapy [3], nucleic acid therapies begin to live up to expectations [4]. Since the first gene therapy clinical trial in 1990, more than 1600 clinical trials have been conducted [5]. Convincing therapeutic success in human clinical trials has been achieved during recent years.",

One is our incomplete knowledge of what is going on inside cells on a molecular level. We do not understand sufficiently well the processes which govern nucleic acid uptake, their intracellular interactions, intracellular trafficking and the regulation of nucleic acid action inside cells. The other limitation, in part being a result of the first one, is the availability of efficient, affordable and safe shuttles for nucleic acid delivery (so-called vectors) and of localizing their action to target cells.",

If the transport of an active ingredient to the target structure which it is intended to interact with becomes a limiting factor, then the prediction holds that any measure that supports/improves such transport will improve the efficiency of the active ingredient. This is the essential paradigm of magnetic drug targeting which dates back to the 1970s. Active ingredients are associated with magnetic particles and are concentrated at a target site by magnetic force. Transport to the target cells is a limiting factor in nucleic acid delivery [6], at least in vivo. First ideas of exploiting the principle of magnetic targeting in nucleic acid delivery appeared in the patent literature in 1996 [7] and 1998 [8], however with little experimental evidence.",

The first accounts in the scientific literature have been conference abstracts by Mah [9] and from our group [10] in the year 2000. At that time, we have coined the acronym magnetofection which since then has been widely used as a generic term for magnetically guided and enhanced nucleic acid delivery in the scientific literature. We have defined magnetofection as nucleic acid delivery under the influence of a magnetic field acting on nucleic acid vectors that are associated with magnetic (nano)particles (Fig. 1\n) [11], [12]. For simplicity, we will use this term throughout this review for nucleic acid delivery methods discussed herein which are based on this principle. The first full paper in this field accepted for publication in a scientific journal was from Hughes and coworkers on magnetically enhanced retroviral nucleic acid delivery [13] followed later by our own work on nonviral and viral magnetofection [14], Pandori's paper on the enhanced infectivity of adenovirus-microbead conjugates and Mah's paper on magnetically enhanced AAV vector-mediated gene delivery [15]. Further publications ensued in 2003, including a first paper on the mechanism of magnetofection [16], a paper on magnetically enhanced oligonucleotide delivery in vitro and in vivo\n[17], on magnetofection of primary endothelial cells [18] and three review papers summarizing the state of the art at that time [12], [19], [20].",

A search as defined in Fig. 2\nin ISI Web of Science delivers 328 hits, the same search in PubMed delivers 144 hits. Combining the two searches results in 374 publications. Not all of these papers are in the field of nucleic acid delivery. But the search delivers a useful summary of the field of interest and related fields where magnetic particles play an important role, i.e. drug delivery, medical imaging, magnetic cell labeling and cell tracking and magnetic separation techniques. 61% of the publications were original articles, 27% were reviews, and 11.3% were proceedings papers, conference abstracts and editorials. From the United States are 32.6% of the publications, 23.3% are from Germany and 12.8% from China. The contributions from China are on a sharp rise year after year. The most cited original article in the field of nucleic acid delivery among all combined ISI and PubMed hits is the original magnetofection article from Scherer et al. [14], the most cited reviews in the field are from Berry et al. on the functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles for biomedicine [21] and from Moghimi et al. on the status of nanomedicine [22]. Many excellent reviews related to the field have appeared recently, and the reader will be referred to these reviews where appropriate. The top 3 cited articles in the field published during the last 5 years are Medarova's paper on in vivo imaging of siRNA delivery and gene silencing in tumors [23], Kim's paper on the toxicity of magnetic nanoparticles in mice [24] and Yu's paper on drug-loaded superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for combined cancer imaging and therapy [25].",

This versatile approach was used to isolate and concentrate the virus from crude extracts, to enhance transduction efficiency and to achieve localized infection in vitro and in vivo. Association of a biotin-labeled retrovirus with streptavidin MagneSpheres 1-\u03bcm (Promega Z5482) was used to concentrate the vectors to receive \u201cinfectious, paramagnetic, retroviral vector particles\u201d [13]. It was shown that the produced retroviral conjugates can then be magnetically attracted to the desired location for infection. Adenovirus particles treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin were conjugated with streptavidin coated magnetic microparticles (Promega) and displayed greater infectivity, particularly on poorly permissive cells controlled spatially by the use of magnetic force [39]. Association of avidin displaying baculovirus with biotinylated 1.1 \u03bcm magnetic microparticles resulted in magnet-guided targeted and improved transduction in BT4C-cells [40]. Capture of a metabolically biotinylated lentivirus by streptavidin Dynal MyOne 1-\u03bcm particles allowed a highly efficient process for the preparation of purified and concentrated infectious lentiviral vectors [36]. Vector conjugation to these dense particles resulted in unexpectedly large increases in titer, \u201cpresumably by promoting the likelihood of interaction with the target cell\u201d [36] even in the absence of the magnetic field.",

Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles with a dextran coating (hydrodynamic diameter of about 46 nm, [45], [46]) and immobilized virus-surface-specific antibodies were specifically assembled with virus particles (100 \u00b1 18 nm) [43] as shown in a scheme in Fig. 3c. After 2 h incubation, the original viral particle population became undetectable and a larger nanoassembly with a size of 550 \u00b1 30 nm was detected. The assembling resulted in dramatically increased MRI relaxivity and thus allowed very sensitive detection of viral particles in serum by measurement of changes in water T2 relaxation times. The approach was further developed to detect a variety of species including DNA, mRNA, proteins, small molecules/drugs, bacteria, and tumor cells. The method was designated \u201cdiagnostic magnetic resonance (DMR)\u201d by its inventors [44].",

The particles had an average hydrodynamic diameter of 200 nm (by dynamic light scattering) and positive electrokinetic potential of + 38.4 \u00b1 0.8 mV when measured in aqueous suspension. We formulated magnetic nonviral and viral vectors with TransMagPEI nanoparticles. The formulations with magnetic nanoparticles alone enhanced transfection and transduction, while application of a magnetic field raised reporter gene expression levels up to three orders of magnitude over those achieved with non-magnetic vectors under the same conditions. Magnetic adenovirus complexes under applied magnetic fields efficiently transduced cells expressing little or no coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) which are otherwise non-permissive for adenoviral infection. Later on, maghemite nanoparticles were decorated with PEI and associated with retroviral vector [56] as well as CombiMag nanoparticles (Chemicell) were associated with measles virus [57] to concentrate the virus and to increase transduction efficiency. A protocol on highly efficient transfection of primary neurons by magnetic vectors formulated with CombiMag nanoparticles is available [58]. Shi et al. [59] prepared magnetic nanoparticles effective in magnetofection stabilized with hyperbranched poly(ethylene imines) with different molecular weights [60]. Formulation of different PEI-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and their complexes with DNA for gene transfection as well as detailed characteristics of the particles are presented in ref.

These particles self-assembled with DNA and adenoviral particles into complexes efficient in transfection and transduction of the suspension type K562 cells by magnetofection [66], [67]. Chorny et al. [41] formulated biodegradable polylactide MNPs containing oleate-coated magnetite and surface modified with PEI oleate that enable DNA binding.

In this method, the time course of optical density or turbidity is recorded under exposure to a gradient magnetic field. The average velocity \u03c5 under a magnetic field gradient is evaluated as \u03c5 = \nL/t\n0.1. Here, L is the average path of the complex movement perpendicular to the measuring light beam and t\n0.1 is the time required for a ten-fold decrease in optical density. Further calculation of the average magnetic moment M of the magnetic complex and estimation of the number of MNPs N associated with the complex was performed using an approach described in detail by Wilhelm et al. [88], accounting for the hydrodynamic diameter and core size of the complexes and magnetization of the nanoparticles. A similar approach was also applied to evaluate the data on quantitative magnetophoresis of live cells and to derive an estimate of iron loading of magnetically labeled cells [89], [90]. The time course of the turbidity of the magnetic lipoplexes, plotted in Fig. 6\n[79], shows that 90% of the non-viral magnetic complexes are sedimented within 13.1 min in the applied magnetic field. The derived magnetophoretic mobility of the complexes of 1.3 \u03bcm s\u22121 and the average hydrodynamic diameter of the complexes of 1616 nm allows one to estimate the average magnetic moment of the complex (4.4 \u00d7 10\u221215\n A m2) and the average number of magnetic nanoparticles associated with the complex (36,281 particles per complex) as shown in the Fig. 6. This experimental approach could be useful for experimental estimations of the kinetics of magnetic sedimentation for any new magnetic complex and for choosing the proper parameters of the magnetic field and exposition necessary to achieve full sedimentation of the complex or to fulfill magnetic targeting.",

The net charge of the complexes which turns to slightly negative in serum-containing medium did not affect the internalization or the final gene expression level. A conversion from positive to negative zeta potential in serum-containing medium is also observed with magnetic complexes of adenovirus (data shown in Table 4). According to magnetophoretic mobility measurements, 30,000\u201340,000 MNPs were associated with the lipid component and plasmid in a complex, resulting in an average magnetic moment at the saturation of magnetization of about (4\u20135) \u00d7 10\u2212 15\n A m2. Some observations on the role of the size of the lipoplexes for their transfection efficiency can be found in previous literature. Ogris et al. [91] reported that aggregated DNA/Tf-PEI complexes with an average size larger than 500 nm resulted in more efficient gene transfer than did smaller particles. Ross and Hui [92] provided evidence that the size of DOTAP/DOPE lipoplexes was the major determinant of the internalization and transfection efficiency and found the largest complexes of 2.2 \u03bcm to be the most efficient in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Li et al. [93] found size and not surface charge to be a major determinant of the in vitro lipofection efficiency of a cationic lipid\u2013pDNA complex. We did not observe a direct relationship between the size of the complex and transfection efficiency, but complexes as large as 2 \u03bcm can deliver genes very efficiently. Nevertheless, complexes with an average hydrodynamic diameter of about 900 nm can also be very efficient, like those formulated with the PEI-Mag2 nanoparticles. These results indicated that the size and charge of the magnetic vectors tested here were not of critical importance for gene delivery to Jurkat T cells. Apparently, fine differences in the composition of the surface layer of the particles cause more significant differences in the efficiency of the derived magnetic lipoplexes, as observed for the NDT-Mag1, PEI-Mag1, PalD1-Mag1 and PL-Mag1 particles.",

            "text": "A first study by Huth et al. published in 2003 has indicated that there are probably no fundamental mechanistic differences between magnetofection and gene delivery with analogous non-magnetic vectors [102]. In their study, they used magnetic and non-magnetic complexes of plasmid DNA with poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), the transfection reagent which is most frequently used among the cationic polymers. The magnetic complexes used in this study consisted of PEI, DNA and PEI-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and were assembled by salt-induced aggregation [19]. After binding to the cell surface, non-magnetic PEI\u2013DNA complexes are internalized into intracellular vesicles called endosomes by the natural uptake process of endocytosis. Escape from endosomes is thought to be essential for functional nucleic acid delivery because otherwise vectors would be degraded by the cellular breakdown machinery [103]. PEI\u2013DNA complexes are thought to escape due to the so-called proton sponge effect [104]. PEI by virtue of its secondary and tertiary amines has buffering capacity at physiological pH. In consequence, if a PEI\u2013DNA particle is internalized into cells by endocytosis it will buffer the natural acidification process within endosomes. This means that the endosomal proton pump needs to pump way more protons into the endosome until the natural acidic endosomal pH is reached. The \u201cproton sponge hypothesis\u201d postulates enhanced gene delivery due to the buffering capacity of polymers with structural features like PEI through enhanced endosomal chloride accumulation, concomitant influx of water and consequent osmotic swelling/lysis. Sonawane et al. have provided experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis [105]. Huth et al. have used electron microscopy and various inhibitors of endocytotic uptake to figure out whether magnetofection with PEI\u2013DNA complexes might proceed via a non-endocytotic pathway. They also used centrifugation to sediment magnetic and standard vectors on the cell surfaces and found that the subsequent application of a magnetic field did not lead to a further increase in gene transfer efficiency. The conclusion from this study was that the uptake mechanism of magnetic PEI\u2013DNA is virtually the same as for standard PEI\u2013DNA. This is in line with the results of mechanistic experiments which Namgung et al. have carried out recently with different PEI-coated magnetic nanoparticles [60]. A recent study by Sauer et al. on magnetic lipoplexes using single particle tracking came to the same conclusion [106]. Similar as with non-magnetic PEI polyplexes [107], they observed a three phase behavior. In phase I, the magnetic lipoplexes attach to the cell surface and show slow cooperative transport. The majority of lipoplexes are internalized via endocytosis during this phase. Phase II is characterized by anomalous and confined diffusion inside cells. Phase III represents active transport along microtubules inside the cell. At later time points, the formation of a perinuclear ring was observed. Persisting colocalization of fluid phase marker and lipoplexes after 24 h indicated slow endosomal release [106]. Perinuclear accumulation has also been observed in a previous study by Li et al. [108].",

            "text": "Two very thorough recent studies by Arsianti et al. provide further mechanistic insights [109], [110], in particular concerning the importance of biophysical properties of magnetic vectors for their efficiency in gene delivery. These authors also used triplexes of PEI, DNA and iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles. The MNP were synthesized in a different manner than in our own setup but were also provided with a PEI coating in one of the examined cases. Arsianti's findings indicate that the major uptake pathway of the vectors is endocytosis via clathrin coated pits rather than via a caveolae-dependent pathway or via macropinocytosis. The mixing order of vector components has an important impact on the resulting biophysical properties (size, zeta potential). The surface characteristics influence the aggregation behavior and the adsorption of serum proteins, the timing and the extent of vector uptake and the intracellular processing. In brief, when the three components (PEI, DNA, magnetic nanoparticles) are assembled in a manner such that PEI is displayed on the particle surface (positive zeta potential in water), serum proteins will adsorb, reverse the surface charge and eventually re-disperse compositions that were previously aggregated [109]. From this, one can conclude that it is essential to characterize vectors in the context of the biological surrounding which they will encounter during the nucleic acid delivery process. Compositions with PEI on the surface displayed rapid uptake, were released from endo/lysosomes and were most effective in gene delivery. Compositions with DNA on the surface (negative zeta potential in water) were also taken up into cells but at a low rate. Endo/lysosomal release and consequently functional gene delivery were inefficient [109]. Hence, it does matter which components are chosen to construct a magnetic vector and how they are assembled. Uptake alone is not sufficient for functional nucleic acid delivery. An efficient magnetic vector requires functional modules for \u201cproductive\u201d intracellular processing and these modules need to be displayed in the right configuration. Arsianti's study highlights a further important aspect: those vector compositions which were most competent in functional gene delivery were also the most toxic ones. However, this is common to many nonviral delivery systems, especially those comprising PEI [111]. Toxicity is a question of vector dose, the coating of magnetic particles and especially of the transfection reagent chosen for assembling magnetic vectors. We have shown that highly efficient and rather non-toxic vectors can be obtained with magnetic lipoplexes [78].",

Improved dose\u2013response relationships and accelerated transfection kinetics appear to be entirely due to the rapid sedimentation of the full applied vector dose to the target cell surface within a few minutes. The diffusion barrier which exists for vector particles which are too small to sediment by gravitational force [6] is overcome, in accordance with model calculations by Furlani and Ng [113]. An increased vector dose at the cell surface results in an increased internalized dose within a given time period, unless uptake processes become saturated (Fig. 9\n) [75], [76], [79]. This alone can, but does not necessarily lead to improved functional nucleic acid delivery. Therefore, in order to classify vector compositions in terms of efficacy, it will be useful to normalize the observed effects (e.g. reporter gene expression, percentage of transfected cells, extent of gene silencing) to the internalized nucleic acid or virus dose. This will be a true measure of the quality of a vector composition.",

The natural infectivity of the virus is governed by the presence or absence of receptors which the virus needs to bind to cells such as the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). In the absence of the required receptors, the virus will not infect, unless it is decorated with some additional binding module. Magnetic nanoparticles can be provide this function and magnetofection can enforce infection even in the absence of virus receptors [14], [39], [55], [66]. It is assumed that the intrinsic mechanism of adenoviral infection is not changed by magnetofection. The important impact is that by simple association with magnetic nanoparticles the virus can be enabled for therapeutic applications where its efficacy would be limited otherwise [55]. A similar enablement of viral infection in non-permissive cells by magnetofection was observed by Kadota et al. with measles virus [57].",

Similarly, Zhang et al. have cultured cells in a 3D collagen matrix and have shown that magnetic vectors penetrate the matrix under magnetic field influence and transfect cells [116]. In this context it is interesting to note that according to studies by MacDonald et al. a time-varied magnetic field enhances the transport of magnetic nanoparticles in a viscous gel (Fig. 10) [117].",

Several publications indicate that non-static fields can be useful to further improve the efficiency of magnetofection. The earliest observations in this respect were from Kamau et al. [118]. They used a magnetic device (the so-called Dynamic Marker) which produces a relatively complex pulsating field with a sinus type wave perpendicular to the cell culture plate overlayed with a field modulation in the plane of the cell culture plate at low frequency. The authors speculate that such alternating fields may cause some oscillation of magnetic particles which may facilitate cellular uptake when the particles are bound to cell surfaces. What really happens is not understood. In any case, using this technique, Kamau et al. achieved quite substantial improvements in the percentage of transfected cells in a variety of cell lines. A combination of pre-magnetization with a permanent field followed by application of the dynamic field resulted in synergistic enhancements. The same group has extended their work and reports on the transfection of primary synoviocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, melanocytes, macrophages, lung fibroblasts, and embryonic fibroblasts [119].",

With Dobson's device which is commercially available now (www.nanotherics.com), this magnetic array \u201cwobbles\u201d in the x\u2013y plane at low frequency (1\u20135 Hz) below the cell culture plate at a suitable amplitude (200 \u03bcm has turned out useful). Under optimized conditions, substantial enhancements in transfection efficiency can be achieved [122], [123]. Pickard and Chari have shown that this system provides considerable enhancements in magnetofection of primary astrocytes [123]. Currently, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. But one can guess that the lateral movement of the magnetic field transmits mechanical forces to cellular membranes via the magnetic vectors associated with these membranes. Mechanical stimuli can have effects on cellular membrane traffic including endo- and exocytosis [124]. In this context it is interesting to note that magnetic actuation of cellular processes is a hot research topic [73], [125], [126]. Mannix et al. have shown that magnetic beads decorated with a specific receptor ligand can be exploited to trigger, via magnetic induction of receptor clustering, a signaling process in mast cells which is involved in immune surveillance [125]. In this particular case, receptor clustering leads to a rapid rise in intracellular calcium. It is known, that calcium plays an important role in endosomal/lysosomal fusion processes [127].

            "text": "For some applications of genetically engineered cells, one of the appealing features of magnetofection is that it necessarily produces magnetically labeled cells. Thus, magnetofected cells offer the opportunity to be positioned by magnetic force [53], [128] and to be tracked by MRI as well as by optical imaging by virtue of the expression of reporter genes such as the luciferase or fluorescent protein genes [129], [130], [131]. One of the advantages of reporter gene imaging is that only viable cells will produce the reporter signal [130], [131]. Quantifying the internalization of magnetic vectors, we have found that various cell types easily incorporate 1\u20135 pg of iron per cell during magnetofection at applied vector doses corresponding to as little as 10 pg iron per cell [55], [94], [96]. With account for the saturation magnetization of the PEI-Mag2 magnetic nanoparticles used in our studies (62 emu/g Fe), the internalization of 5 pg Fe/cell would result in a magnetic moment of 0.31 \u00d7 10\u22129\n emu per cell. For comparison, Polyak et al. were able to magnetically target bovine aortic endothelial cells loaded with polymeric superparamagnetic nanoparticles with a resulting magnetic moment of about 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22129\n emu/cell to steel stent wires [128]. Sufficient sensitivity to be detected by cardiac MRI has been achieved with 105 cells having incorporated picogram quantities of iron oxide [131], [132].",

Therefore, we were wondering whether pre-loading of cells with magnetic nanoparticles interferes with magnetofection efficiency [84]. Thus, we pre-loaded H441 cells with NDT-Mag1 magnetic nanoparticles (see Table 1 and Fig. 11\n). The internalized 38 pg of iron per cell gave rise to a magnetic moment of 0.8 \u00d7 10\u221212\n A m2\n = 0.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 emu per cell which was sufficient to engraft the cells onto the luminal surface of a tube in a radial magnetic field. Subsequently, the MNP-labeled cells were magnetofected with nonviral vectors associated with PEI-Mag2 magnetic nanoparticles in the radial magnetic field. A similar experiment was carried out in standard 2D culture format. The magnetic pre-labeling of the cells did not interfere with but even increased the efficiency of magnetofection without causing toxicity (Fig. 12\n). The cell labeling with NDT-Mag1 MNPs resulted in high transverse relaxivities r2* of 410 \u00b1 70 mM\u22121\n s\u22121. In this manner, multi-echo gradient echo imaging and R2* mapping detected as few as ca. 1500 MNP-labeled H441 cells localized within a 50 \u03bcl fibrin clot as well as MNP-labeled cell monolayers that were engrafted on the luminal surface of a cell culture tube using the radial magnetic field mentioned above.",

Pre-loading at an internalized dose of 50 pg Fe/cell resulted in a two-fold increase in transduction efficiency compared to the cells labeled just before magselectofection with CD105 MicroBeads [83]. The enhancement was observed both in terms of overall reporter gene expression as well as in terms of the percentage of transduced cells (Fig. 12). The increase in transfection/transduction efficiency may be due to a local field gradient generated by the internalized MNPs when exposed to an external field. This would result in additional magnetic force in the vicinity of the cells, improving the attraction of gene vectors in the immediate surrounding. This phenomenon is known as the avalanche effect and was utilized, for example by Aviles et al. [133] to improve the targeting of magnetic drugs using implantable ferromagnetic elements, such as wires, needles, catheters, or stents, to increase the magnetic force locally by increasing the gradient of the field close to the cell.",

The development of HIV vaccines, for example, requires a precise understanding of the immunological and virological principles of HIV infection. The synchronization of HIV infection in vitro facilitates the study of events in the viral replication cycle and the antiviral immune response on short timescales which was previously impossible. In combination with the high transduction efficiency, magnetofection increases the throughput of in vitro assays [156] including T cell assays which require virally infected cells [151], [152], [157], [158], [159]. Synchronization is the critical parameter for studying the kinetics of viral infection as well as for identifying the key focus of vaccine development especially in terms of which viral proteins (early or late) are better for inducing a specific T cell immune response. For example, magnetofection allowed to investigate the kinetics of SIV peptide epitope presentation to CD8(+) [146], [153], [160], [161] and to CD4(+) T cells [162] or to define conformational state dynamics of HIV Env [163]. Magnetofection was used to show that Gag-specific CD8+ T cells recognize infected CD4+ T lymphocytes as early as 2 h post-infection, before proviral DNA integration, viral protein synthesis, and Nef-mediated MHC class I down-regulation [146], [160]. Using magnetofection, Sacha et al. showed that early presentation of incoming virion-derived Gag epitopes was maximal at 6 h post-infection, while Gag epitope presentation due to de novo synthesis occurred between 18 and 24 h. They also showed that the penetration of virion-associated proteins into the cytoplasm was sufficient to generate CD8(+) T cell epitopes early after infection [146]. Also in further studies, the synchronization of infection by magnetofection was the key to define the kinetics of epitope presentation of infected T cells [147], [153], [164] as well as infected macrophages [162].",

For example, Barsov et al. have used magnetofection to selectively immortalize tumor-specific T cells to establish long-term T-cell lines while maintaining primary cell characteristics [139]. The ability to isolate, maintain, and characterize tumor-specific T cells is a prerequisite to studying anticancer immune response and developing novel strategies for cancer immunotherapy. However, the life span of human T cells in vitro is usually short and is limited by the onset of cellular senescence. To solve this problem, immortalized antigen-responsive T cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were produced by magnetofecting cells with a MLV vector carrying an immortalizing gene, the human telomerase-reverse transcriptase gene [139].",

Magnetofection increased the infectivity compared with virus alone in non-polarized and polarized bronchial cells and greatly enhanced the transduction in \u201cdomes\u201d (cells forming hemicysts containing fluid) which are resistant to lentiviral transduction [54], [167].",

ViroMag allowed the authors to increase virus infection and concentrate the virus on cells. This has led to a breakthrough discovery in the field of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

For these cells, the balance between transfection efficiency and toxic effects is a problem for biological and electrophysiological studies. In this context, magnetofection reagents have proven to be efficient while minimizing any undesired secondary effects. A large variety of primary neurons such as hippocampal [58], [168], [169], [170], [171], [172], [173], [174], [175], [176], [177], [178], [179], cortical [58], [180], [181], [182], [183], [184], neocortical [185], vagal afferent [186], [187], dorsal root ganglion [184], [188], nodose ganglions [189], cerebellar granule [190], [191] or motor neurons [192] and multipotent neural precursor/stem cells (NPCs) [193] have been successfully transfected. High transfection efficiency was achieved in primary rat astrocytes from cerebral cortices [123], [194]. During recent years, Divya Chari's group has contributed a great deal to the methodological development of magnetofection of neuronal and neuroglial cells, including the study on the use of oscillating magnetic fields [123], [193], [195], [196]. Furthermore, they have carried out studies on the uptake of magnetic nanoparticles in these cell types and associated toxicity. Most recently, they have studied gene delivery to multipotent neural precursor/stem cells (NPCs) which are a major transplant population with key properties to promote repair in several neuropathological conditions [193]. They have demonstrated, using a neurosphere culture model system, that even repeated nonviral transfection (\u201cmultifection\u201d) with magnetic nanoparticles was feasible with negligible toxicity. The differentiation potential of NPCs was maintained and they survived and differentiated in 3D neural tissue arrays post-transplantation. Even though magnetic field application had little, if any, enhancing effect in this study, their findings are important in view of the emerging regenerative therapies with genetically modified cells.",

These cells are used in in vitro models to study basic mechanisms of development, axon growth and to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying motor neuron diseases. So far, functional studies in primary motor neurons have been hampered by the lack of efficient transfection tools to achieve either protein overexpression or gene knockdown. Transduction with lentiviral vectors is currently the standard protocol, but this method faces several limitations such as the size of the insert, the cytotoxicity, as well as the requirement for safety precautions and special equipments. In order to overcome these limitations, Fallini et al. have established a new protocol based on magnetofection using the NeuroMag reagent [192]. Under optimized conditions, transfection rates above 45% were routinely achieved with no alteration of the morphology or survival of the transfected motor neurons. Moreover, gene expression was observed at a high level several days after transfection. Co-transfection of three different plasmids and gene knockdown using shRNA constructs were also successfully performed [192]. The authors were thus able to show for the first time that the spinal muscular atrophy-disease protein Smn is actively transported along axons of live primary neurons, supporting an axon-specific role for Smn besides its involvement in mRNA splicing. Finally, the motor neuron adapted magnetofection protocol was used to deliver shRNA-based constructs, thereby significantly reducing Smn levels in both cell bodies and axons [192]. This important experimental procedure is also posted on the Alzheimer Research Forum website: http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2461.",

It also allows double-transfection and long-lasting DNA and shRNA construct expression without interfering with neuronal differentiation. Because mature neurons are more sensitive to commercial lipid reagent exposure than immature neurons, the lipid exposure time for transfection\u2014toxic for the neurons\u2014can be reduced by magnetofection.

They have used specific single chain antibody fragments against gephyrin (scFv-gephyrin) to hamper its function. To carry out this study, they needed to achieve expression of both eGFP (for control) and scFv gephyrin protein in primary hippocampal neurons which was possible by magnetofection. When expressed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons as a fusion protein containing a nuclear localization signal, scFv-gephyrin was able to remove endogenous gephyrin from GABAa receptor clusters [174]. The authors have shown a significant reduction in the number of synaptic 2-subunits containing GABAa receptor and a significant decrease in the density of the GABAergic presynaptic marker vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in scFV-gephyrin transfected neurons. These effects were associated with a reduction in the amplitude and in the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and also with a significant reduction in GABAa receptor-mediated tonic conductance. The results indicate that gephyrin is essential not only for maintaining synaptic GABAa receptor clusters in the right position but also for regulating both phasic and tonic inhibition.",

This assisted in showing that phosphorylation of Nogo receptors by casein kinase II (CK2) inhibits binding of the myelin-associated proteins. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulates the phosphorylation, suppressing Nogo-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth from neuroblastoma-derived neural cells. Similarly, in rat adult neurons, extracellular CK2 treatment overcomes inhibition of neurite outgrowth by the myelin-associated proteins. These findings provide new strategies to control Nogo signaling and hence neuronal regeneration [188]. Nogo signaling has critical roles in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS). It can inhibit differentiation, migration, and neurite outgrowth of neurons, causing poor recovery of the adult CNS from damage.",

A cDNA of the Sry gene or an shRNA construct to down-regulate Sox9 expression were magnetofected into genital ridge tissue in a gain of function approach in the first case or loss-of-function in the latter case. The expression of Sry induced female-to-male sex-reversal, whereas knockdown of Sox9 expression caused male-to-female sex-reversal, consistent with the known functions of these genes.

For example, Basile et al. are interested in semaphorins which are a family of proteins originally identified as regulators of axon growth. These proteins also have been implicated in blood vessel development. Using magnetofection as a research tool, Basile et al. were able to highlight the role of semaphorin 4D in tumor-induced angiogenesis and to characterize the involved mechanisms [204], [211], [223], [224]. In another study for deciphering angiogenic pathways, Mannel et al. used magnetofection of antisense oligonucleotides to define the role of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in angiogenesis [209]. In another study, relevant in identifying mechanisms of cancer development, Steele et al. have used magnetofection in gastric epithelial cells to identify promoter elements which regulate the expression of Reg1. This a putative growth factor which is significantly increased in Helicobacter pylori infected patients [197]. H. pylori accelerates the progression of gastric cancer through an unknown mechanism. Using magnetofection as research tool, Steel et al. could demonstrate the role of the promoter elements in responding to H. pylori and gastrin. In a thematically related study, also involving magnetofection, Ashurst et al. defined the minimal promoter required for transcription of CCK2R in human gastric adenocarcinoma [225]. Gastrin/CCK receptor (CCK2R) plays a major role in the physiological regulation of gastric acid secretion.",

For example, Mitsutani et al. used magnetofection to examine pathways involved in SARS-coronavirus infection [226], [227]. SARS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrom (SARS). Guix et al. have used magnetofection to establish a model for Norwalk virus (NV) infection [228]. Norwalk viruses (NVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses and are the leading cause of epidemic acute viral gastroenteritis in developed countries. The absence of an in vitro cell culture model for NV infection has hampered the development of effective antiviral therapies and vaccines. Using magnetofection, the authors were able to transfect Huh-7 cells with NV RNA isolated from stool samples from human volunteers. Transfection leads to viral replication with expression of viral antigens, RNA replication and release of viral particles into the medium. It was therefore demonstrated for the first time that NV RNA isolated from stool samples from human volunteers is infectious when transfected into mammalian cells.",

It contributed to demonstrating the critical role of a transcription factor in angiogenesis [206] and of a selective estrogen receptor modulator in atherosclerosis [207]. Similarly, magnetofection-induced gene knockdown by siRNA in HMEC-1 allowed researchers to figure out the implication of a certain kinase (ROCK-II isoform) in the formation of microparticles in response to thrombin stimulation [236]. Magnetofection of 25 nM siRNA induced more than 50% inhibition. Out of the two isoforms (Rho kinase I and II), the specific targeting of ROCK-II with siRNA was the only one to be implicated in the caspase-2-induced release of endothelial microparticles in response to thrombin stimulation unravelling a new pathway in microparticles formation. Three years later, the same authors continued their study on the release of procoagulant endothelial microparticles induced by thrombin using the SilenceMag magnetofection reagent on HMEC-1 and on primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Transfecting endothelial cells with siRNA targeting TRAIL, induced a decrease in microparticle production in response to thrombin and moreover reduced the pro-coagulant potential of these endothelial microparticles unravelling a potential mechanism linking inflammation and coagulation [243]. Also Meda et al. have used siRNA magnetofection in HUVECs to examine biphasic effects of drugs on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and cytotoxicity, as well as drug interference with the interaction of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) [94].",

This in turn probably requires the release of P-selectin from intracellular stores via exocytosis. Using siRNA magnetofection to knock down two particular kinases, Ge et al. could pinpoint a molecular link between the triggering of exocytosis by angiotensin II and consequent P-selectin surface expression. Hence they were able to propose a mechanism that links angiotensin II signaling to inflammation.",

            "text": "A systemic administration via the circulation is a challenge for any drug delivery system, magnetic or non-magnetic [268], [269]. If magnetic compositions are assembled by non-covalent interactions, dissociation of the assembly in the in vivo milieu can occur and thus obviate magnetic targetability. Furthermore, vertebrates are equipped with defense mechanisms to eliminate intruders such as viruses or bacteria and, unfortunately, nanomedicines. The complement system which is a phylogenetically ancient form of innate immunity can tag intruders to be eliminated from the circulation by macrophages. This has been recognized to be a challenge for the construction of gene vectors many years ago [270] and has remained a challenge for particulate drug delivery systems in general [271], [272], [273]. A commonly used approach to protect drug delivery systems from undesired interactions with blood components and from rapid elimination from the circulation by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) is surface shielding with polymers like polyethylenglycols. While this is highly effective and has been established for liposomes many years ago, this concept has been implemented with multi-component magnetic compositions for nucleic acid delivery only recently [33], [60], [73], [274], [275], [276], [277], [278]. Sufficiently long circulation in the bloodstream at least on the tens of minutes, better on the hour timescale is a prerequisite to capture a substantial fraction of a magnetic drug formulation in a target tissue [279]. This is because first pass retention by a magnetic gradient field is low except at low blood flow rates [280] and after the first passage, the drug carrier will distribute throughout the vascular system. In systemic drug delivery to tumors, long-circulating drug formulations can extravasate into the tumor tissue by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) [281], [282]. This effect designates the increased leakiness of blood vessels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissue. Current strategies in systemic gene and drug delivery to tumors aim at combining passive targeting via the EPR effect with active targeting exploiting magnetic force and biological receptor\u2013ligand interactions [283]. Among the published studies, several have focused on the systemic delivery of nucleic acids [12], [14], [17], [23], [33], [53], [63], [65], [73], [86], [98], [108], [251], [253], [260], [261], [265] or magnetofected cells [115] to tumors using magnetic carriers. But surprisingly in only two of the studies a magnetic field has been applied to enhance the accumulation of magnetic cells or nucleic acid carriers, respectively, in the tumor tissue [63], [115].",

            "text": "Although there had been earlier reports on magnetically targeted nucleic acid delivery in vivo, a breakthrough in magnetic targeting to tumors upon intravenous administration had been lacking until Namiki et al. published their work in 2009 [63]. They have shown for the first time that this concept is feasible and also have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in mouse models of gastric cancer with magnetically targeted siRNA.1\nThe study of the Japanese authors highlights the level of interdisciplinarity that is required to achieve technological breakthroughs. First, they synthesized magnetic nanoparticles following a known approach which however has been neglected by other groups working in magnetically guided nucleic acid delivery. This was possibly the key for obtaining nanomagnetic compositions with nucleic acids that are enabled for magnetic targeting to tumors upon intravenous administration. Such formulations were the result of a comprehensive biophysical characterization and optimization involving nucleic acid delivery studies with 13 different cell lines. Targeting to tumors in gastric cancer mouse models was achieved with the optimized composition when a magnetic field was applied to the tumors but not without magnetic field and also not with a commercially available magnetic transfection reagent. Delivery was localized to tumor blood vessels. Consequently the authors chose siRNA as a therapeutic agent and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression as the molecular target (EGF-R is over-expressed in tumor blood vessel endothelium and has been shown to be a validated target for therapeutic intervention by many other authors [284]). In this manner they achieved retardation of tumor growth which is clearly linked to the target-specific action of siRNA on a molecular level. Adverse reactions that one might expect from the delivery of magnetic nanoparticles or EGF-R knock-down in non-target organs were not observed. Namiki and colleagues were not the first to demonstrate targeting of nucleic acids or specifically siRNA to tumors and to demonstrate associated therapeutic benefit [284], [285]. Using a different tumor model, Huang and colleagues have achieved an even more favorable siRNA biodistribution profile with a non-magnetic shielded and receptor-targeted formulation [286]. And other researchers using non-magnetic receptor-targeted gene delivery have even reported complete tumor remissions [286]. Nevertheless, the study by Namiki and colleagues has opened new perspectives. They show that accumulation in a tumor and therapeutic benefit of a non-shielded, non-receptor targeted formulation of siRNA is enabled by magnetic force. Magnetic targeting enforces the first and essential steps of nucleic acid delivery which are accumulation in a target tissue and establishing target cell contact. Hence one can expect that a future combination of shielding, receptor targeting and magnetic targeting will result in a synergistic improvement of the dose\u2013response profile. What are the limitations? From a medical point of view, magnetic drug targeting makes sense primarily in localized stages of disease and less in metastatic stages where drug action may be required throughout the body. Nevertheless, there are plenty of medical indications where magnetic targeting of nucleic acids may yield a substantial advantage. The major limitation of Magnetic Drug Targeting is a physical one: the magnetic force acting on magnetic nanoparticles drops with some power of the distance from the source of the magnetic field (depending on the geometry of the pole shoe). The \u201cpenetration depth\u201d of this force, which is proportional to the magnetic flux density and the field gradient, is low. It is not trivial to generate sufficient field and gradient at a target site inside the body. In the Supplementary Materials of their paper Namiki and colleagues have described a biocompatible surface coating of permanent magnets with titanium nitride. Minimal-invasive implantation of such magnets at tumor sites may provide a viable solution for generating sufficient magnetic force for magnetic drug targeting.",

            "text": "Among the other publications on systemic nucleic acid delivery to tumors with nanomagnetic carriers [23], [98], [260], [287], [288], the work of Medarova and colleagues [260] has been the most inspiring. Based on earlier work by Josephson et al. [289], [290] they have prepared dextran-coated magnetic nanoparticles with covalently attached siRNA, near-infrared dye Cy5.5 and membrane translocation peptides. Using magnetic resonance and optical imaging, they have shown the feasibility of in vivo tracking of tumor uptake of these carriers. Furthermore, using optical imaging they could follow the silencing of the target reporter gene in vivo. With the same concept, but now using a therapeutically relevant siRNA and a receptor targeted system, they could demonstrate favorable accumulation of the system and therapeutic benefit in a human breast adenocarcinoma xenograft model in nude mice [260]. It is remarkable, that this was achieved without applying magnetic targeting and it would be interesting to know whether this would yield additional benefit. Conceptually related work has been published by Kievit, Veiseh and colleagues [33], [73], [277], [291]. They have developed a nanovector consisting of an iron oxide core coated with a copolymer of chitosan, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI). After electrostatic binding of plasmid DNA (encoding a gene of interest) or siRNA [279], chlorotoxin (CTX) as a receptor ligand is attached to the system using a short PEG linker. Upon intravenous injection, they have achieved efficient gene delivery to c6 rat glioma xenograft tumors in nude mice [73]. The authors have not applied magnetic targeting because they argue that this strategy provides little advantage for highly invasive and infiltrative cancers, such as glioma. In a previous study, the same group has shown that a similar magnetic nanoparticle conjugate without PEI or nucleic acids but equipped with a near-infrared dye accumulates well in autochthonous medulloblastoma tumors in genetically engineered ND2:SmoA1 mice. In this case, the system was used as multimodal imaging probe and not for nucleic acid delivery [291].",

            "text": "Further work on magnetic targeting of nucleic acids upon systemic administration includes our own early proof of principle experiments on the magnetic localization of DNA and oligonucleotide delivery in the vascular system [12], [14], [17]. A further interesting finding about ion oxide nanoparticles was obtained by Xiang et al. who claimed that intravenously injected polylysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles can even transfer DNA across the blood\u2013brain barrier to glial cells and neurons of the brain [265]. No magnetic targeting was involved in this study, and the major reporter gene expression was found in the mouse lung. The same vector composition was used later by Li et al. to delivery an anti-metastatic gene in a pulmonary metastasis mouse model [261]. Therapeutic benefit could be achieved in that tumor growth was inhibited. Also here, no magnetic targeting has been involved. Magnetic targeting was involved however in a study published by the Steinhoff group [108]. They have achieved magnetically targeted gene delivery to cardiac tissue. The magnetic carrier was assembled with biotinylated PEI\u2013DNA complexes and streptavin-coated magnetic nanoparticles. The cells expressing the reporter gene were identified as endothelial cells by histological analysis. In the same manner, the authors have achieved magnetically targeted delivery of the therapeutically relevant bcl-2 and VEGF genes. Flexman et al. have achieved magnetic accumulation of Feridex MRI contrast agent in the heads of rats. For this purpose, the contrast agent was incorporated in the hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelopes (HVJ-Es). No nucleic acid delivery was involved in this study which is mentioned here because in many previous studies HVJ-Es have been shown to be excellent agents for gene delivery. Muthana et al. have accumulated magnetofected monocytes in pc3 (prostate cancer cell line) tumor xenografts in nude mice upon intravenous administration [115]. This is relevant because for some applications genetically engineered cells are considered to be useful as an indirect gene delivery agent to tumors. Cheong et al. have described water soluble chitosan\u2013linoleic acid conjugates which they used to assemble complexes with DNA or siRNA and magnetic nanoparticles [251]. These complexes, when injected intravenously in mice accumulated passively in the liver and gave rise to reporter gene expression. No magnetic targeting has been involved in this study. In contrast, Zheng et al. have applied magnetic targeting to the liver upon intravenous injection of a magnetic composition of DNA in rats and have observed increased reporter gene expression in this organ compared to the absence of magnetic targeting [65].",

In the next step, they injected the vector through the carotid artery in mice. When a permanent magnet was placed at the right abdominal wall close to the liver, a significant redistribution of LV/MNP complexes to the liver was observed and, concomitantly, the number of viral integrants in the lung was significantly reduced. The authors also showed that HUVECs magnetofected with a high magnetic nanoparticle dose could be magnetically positioned in the blood vessel walls in an ex vivo model. And finally they showed that this was as well possible in vivo. Upon injection into the thoracic aorta, lentiviral magnetofected cells were accumulated in the abdominal aorta or in the iliac artery in the areas that were under magnetic field influence. Similarly the authors could magnetically target such cells to the denuded common carotid artery upon injection in to the carotid artery. These studies are relevant in the field of (stem)cell transplantation, tissue repair and tissue engineering with genetically modified cells but also with respect to targeting genetically modified cells to tumors [115].",

As a magnetic carrier of plasmid DNA they used the commercially available PolyMAG transfection reagent in conjunction with bis(cysteinyl) histidine-rich, endosomolytic Tat peptides (which enhanced transfection efficiency) [71]. In the in vivo experiment, they placed a magnet on the back of animals in order to prevent gene transfer complexes from being carried away by cerebrospinal fluid flow. They examined two conditions, one where the magnet remained static and one where the magnet was moved along the spinal cord. Under the latter condition, the peak level reporter gene expression was detected in the cervical spinal cord remote from the injection site, with the lowest level of transgene expression in the lumbar spinal cord. Hence, the authors have demonstrated that in their model the magnetic vectors can be magnetically guided after localized injection. Similar findings were reported by Hashimoto et al. [256]. They have attached an adenoviral gene vector to magnetic particles via biotin\u2013streptavidin linkage.

            "text": "Magnetofection including magnetic field application yielded clear advantages in magnetic vaccine studies by Zhou et al. [267] and Xiang et al. [266]. Zhou and colleagues injected magnetic DNA reporter gene compositions into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mice and rabbits and found clearly enhanced reporter gene expression under magnetic field influence compared to controls (naked DNA and magnetic vector in the absence of a magnetic field). To assess the relative ability to prime antibody and T-cell responses, mice were immunized by intramuscular injection with HIV-1 gag DNA with magnetic vectors under magnetofection conditions, with magnetic vectors without magnetic field application and with naked DNA. Magnetofection significantly enhanced antibody responses to HIV-1 gag protein compared to controls. Furthermore, magnetofection induced the immune response at a much lower DNA dose than naked DNA, indicating an approximately 1000-fold increase in DNA vaccine potency. Furthermore, magnetofection accelerated the development of a humoral immune response significantly. Magnetofection gave 100% seroconversion already 1 week after a single immunization compared to 5 weeks with naked DNA. This is of major clinical interest. Zhou et al. have also examined the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response induced by immunization with the magnetic DNA vaccine. Also in this respect, magnetofection displayed a more than 1000-fold increase in DNA vaccine potency in terms of required DNA dose. The authors speculate that the observed enhancements may be based on an improved tissue penetration of the vaccine under magnetofection conditions, on transient tissue damage by the magnetic vaccine and possibly transfection of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). Xiang et al. obtained similar results with a magnetic DNA vaccine based on PEI-coated bacterial magnetic nanoparticles [266]. They immunized mice by intramuscular injection with magnetic and non-magnetic PEI\u2013DNA complexes encoding the foot\u2013mouth disease viral capsule protein VP1. Also they found a significant enhancement of humoral and cellular immune responses against the target antigen compared to controls which were magnetic DNA complex in the absence of a magnetic field, non-magnetic PEI\u2013DNA, naked DNA as well as PEI and magnetic particles without DNA. The two studies demonstrate a substantial potential of magnetofection in genetic vaccination.",

            "text": "A very special type localized administration and magnetic targeting was published by Dames et al. [252]. They have experimented with magnetic aerosols which they call nanomagnetosols. Magnetic aerosols are generated from aqueous suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles using a nebulizer (in this case a nebulizer which is approved for inhalation therapies). Nanomagnetosols are liquid droplets comprising magnetic nanoparticles and can in addition comprise active ingredients such as gene vectors. Using an electromagnet, Dames et al. could target DNA delivery to specific regions of the mouse lung. With respect to lung disease, aerosol delivery of drugs by inhalation represents the most straightforward strategy to target the diseased tissue [292]. In only a few previous studies, an approach of \u201ctargeted dose intensification\u201d has been attempted in human lung cancer therapy [293], [294]. With respect to the physical constraints of magnetic drug targeting, an important feature of nanomagnetosols is the fact that in the case of aerosols, the actual drug carrier is the aerosol droplet which can be of several micrometers in diameter and which can comprise a multitude of magnetic nanoparticles. Hence, this carrier \u201cappears\u201d to an external magnetic field like one large magnetic particle [295]. Another compelling feature of magnetic aerosols is that the active ingredient does not need to be bound to the magnetic particles. The only requirement is that it is comprised within the same aerosol droplet. Magnetic aerosols can be a useful tool to increase the deposited dose of a drug in the lung and to direct it preferentially to one of the lung lobes. In ongoing experiments, the technology is evaluated in pigs. Preliminary results confirm the magnetic targetability also in this larger dimension (unpublished results).",

This is one of the most frequent tumor diseases in cats with an extremely high recurrence rate. In about 75% of animals, the tumor recurs within 1 year of surgical removal [296]. In our ongoing veterinary clinical study, we inject plasmid DNA (comprising a cytokine gene) which is electrostatically bound to positively-charged magnetic nanoparticles directly into the tumor. We call this composition Magnetovax. Subsequently, a permanent magnet is attached to the tumor with adhesive tape in order to hold the injected dose in the tumor. This may also enhance the uptake of the magnetic complex into the tumor cells. The injection is carried out 2 weeks and 1 week prior to surgical removal of the tumor, which is the standard therapy. We have shown that this treatment actually leads to the expression of the therapeutic gene. The cytokine is intended to activate the immune system against the tumor in a sufficient manner to control remaining tumor cells after surgery. In the meantime, more than 150 animal patients have been treated in various treatment arms of the study. The treatment was very well tolerated and treatment drastically increased the percentage of long-term relapse-free animals. The results of the study will be published soon.",

            "text": "Implementation of cell therapy approaches require efficient methods for separation and genetic modification of cells in a cost-effective manner with low vector consumption, with a minimum number of handling steps and amenable to automation in a closed system. We have developed a new methodology for cell separation and transfection/transduction in a single standardized procedure that we called \u201cMagselectofection\u201d (presented schematically in Fig. 14\n) [83]. A high gradient magnetic field cell separation column is used as a magnetic device to associate magnetic gene delivery vectors with magnetically labeled cells while they are passaged and separated through the column. In a model cell mixture of the suspension K562 and Jurkat T cells we have demonstrated that an optimized loading of the separation column with magnetic vectors does not interfere with cell separation efficiency and genetic modification occurs predominantly in the target cell population for both non-viral and viral magnetic vectors. Optimized magnetic vector formulations allow almost complete vector immobilization and association with the target cells at the column. The stronger magnetic forces prevailing in a high gradient field magnetic separation column and also the high concentration of \u201creactants\u201d (vectors and cells) under magselectofection conditions enforce vector-target cell contact and enhance internalization of the vectors resulting in highly efficient transfection/transduction cell lines and primary monocell cultures. In human umbilical cord mesenchymal cells at an applied 8 pg plasmid DNA per cell, 30% of cells were transfected and 60\u2013100% cells were transduced depending on the donor when using 0.5 transducing units lentivirus per cells. Reporter gene expression was stably maintained during 1 month for most of the donors. At a lentiviral MOI 5 and low cell density 21% of hCB-CD34+ cells were transduced with eGFP reporter and maintained their progenitor cell phenotype after magselectofection. Lentiviral magselectofection with low MOIs (\u2264 3) yielded up to 50% transduced mouse Lin\u2212Sca1+ cells, which persistently reconstitute T and B cells in Il2rg\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, compared to less than 10% with higher MOIs using standard transduction protocol for Lin\u2212 bone marrow cells [297]. The developed technology can become a valuable tool for cell therapies with genetically engineered cells.",

            "text": "Despite the many reports on magnetically enhanced infection, little is known about whether or how this concept can be used to enhance the oncolytic potency of replicating viruses. Oncolytic viruses count among the most promising innovative cancer therapeutics. Therefore, we examined the potential of boosting the efficacy of the oncolytic adenovirus dl520 by associating it with magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic-field-guided infection in multidrug-resistant (MDR) CAR-deficient tumor cancer cells in vitro and upon intratumoral injection in vivo\n[55]. Characteristics and morphology of the Ad520 complexes with PEI-Mag2 nanoparticles are given in Table 4 and in Fig. 8, respectively. Viral uptake into cells with optimized magnetic virus complexes at a given virus dose was enhanced 10-fold compared to nonmagnetic virus when infections were carried out under the influence of a magnetic field (Fig. 9). Increased virus internalization resulted in a 10-fold enhancement of the oncolytic potency in terms of the dose required for killing 50% of the target cells (IC50 value, Fig. 15a) and an enhancement of 4 orders of magnitude in virus progeny formation at equal input virus doses compared to nonmagnetic viruses. The observed virus uptake was independent of the CAR expression of cells. The full oncolytic effect developed very fast within 2 days post-infection compared with 6 days in a nonmagnetic virus as a reference. Plotting target cell viability versus internalized virus particles for magnetic and nonmagnetic virus showed that the inherent oncolytic productivity of the virus remained unchanged upon association with magnetic nanoparticles (Fig. 15b). Hence, we concluded that the mechanism of boosting the oncolytic effect by magnetic force is mainly due to the improved internalization of magnetic virus complexes resulting in potentiated virus progeny formation. Upon intratumoral injection and application of a gradient magnetic field in a murine xenograft model in a pilot experiment, magnetic virus complexes exhibited a stronger oncolytic effect than adenovirus alone. We propose that this approach would be useful during in vivo administration to tumor-feeding blood vessels to boost the efficacy of the primary infection cycle within the tumor. For systemic application, further modification of magnetic adenovirus complexes for shielding and retargeting of the whole magnetic virus complex entity is needed.",

One is the rapid clearance of particulate drug carriers from the circulation which we have discussed above. The other is the difficulty of exerting sufficient magnetic force to nanomagnetic carriers to counterbalance the hydrodynamic forces of the blood stream. The underlying physics has been discussed in excellent papers elsewhere [20], [280]. The objective is optimizing retention, tissue penetration and cellular uptake. The magnetic force acting on a magnetic drug carrier is proportional to the magnetic flux density, the field gradient and to the third power of its radius. The hydrodynamic force acting on this carrier according to Stoke's law is proportional to the first power of the radius. Based on a simplified consideration, one can predict that increasing the particle size will over-proportionally be in favor of the magnetic force. On the other hand, constraints on a suitable particle size for in vivo applications are given by the diameter of blood capillaries (around 5 \u03bcm). Embolization needs to be avoided.",

Some of these requirements are fulfilled by magnetic liposomes [298], [299]. Another approach is combining sonoporation and magnetofection. Microbubbles are gas bubbles usually of a few micrometers in diameter surrounded by a shell which can consist of proteins, polymers, lipids or combinations thereof. Due to their gas content, they are excellent reflectors of ultrasound. Consequently they are used as contrast agents in medical ultrasound imaging. Both low molecular weight drugs and nucleic acids can be associated with microbubbles in various ways. In addition, microbubbles can be targeted exploiting receptor\u2013ligand type interactions (including antigen\u2013antibody interactions) [300], [301]. Drug-loaded microbubbles hold potential as \u201cmagic bullet\u201d agents to deliver drugs to precise locations in the body, these precise locations being determined by where the ultrasound energy is focused [301], [302]. The interaction of microbubbles and ultrasound in the low MHz range leads to cavitation, microstreaming and eventually to bubble burst and consequent drug release [303]. In addition, cavitation can lead to microvessel rupture leading to increased permeability of the endothelial barrier [304], [305]. This effect has been used to deliver nanoparticles and even red blood cells to the interstitium of rat skeletal muscle [306]. Cavitation nuclei formed by microbubbles have also been used to permeabilize the blood\u2013brain barrier [307]. Essential for a combination with magnetofection is that microbubbles have been used very successfully in nucleic acid delivery in a variety of tissues [308], [309], [310].",

            "text": "Based on this state of the art, we [86], [257], [311], [312], [313] and others [314] reasoned that microbubbles may be ideal carriers to incorporate a high quantity of magnetic nanoparticles as well as active agents such as drugs or nucleic acids (Fig. 16\n). This idea had already been published in the year 2000 by Soetanto and coworkers [315]. The expectation was that the flexibility of this carrier should be sufficient to \u201csqueeze\u201d through blood capillaries and that magnetic accumulation of the carrier against hydrodynamic forces ought to be facilitated compared with \u201cfree\u201d, physically uncoupled magnetic nanoparticles. This has been confirmed in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments published recently [86], [313]. We have developed two generations of magnetic microbubbles. The first generation which we call magnetic acoustically active lipospheres (MAALs) was based on a composition developed by Unger et al. for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs (Fig. 17\n) [316]. Its main component is soybean oil that has been stabilized by an outer layer of amphipathic lipids. In order to bind nucleic acids, we included a cationic lipid transfection reagent in this formulation, and to make it magnetic, we incorporated detergent-coated magnetic nanoparticles. This formulation has high binding capacity for nucleic acids and has favorable magnetic properties but is not very responsive to ultrasound. In cell culture, ultrasound application did not have an enhancing effect in gene or siRNA delivery over magnetic field application alone. However, in a pre-clinical model of ischemic skin flap survival in rats which is relevant in reconstructive surgery, the best therapeutic effect VEGF-gene-loaded MAALs was achieved with a combined application of magnetic field and ultrasound [257]. In this particular model, MAALs are injected subcutaneously in the skin flap area. The expression of the VEGF gene leads to the formation of new blood vessels, which improves the blood supply to the tissue. In another model, a dorsal skinfold chamber model in mice, nucleic acid deposition in the target area upon injection into the blood circulation was only achieved when the magnetic field and ultrasound were applied in combination (Fig. 18\n) [312]. Stride et al. have reported on a magnetic microbubble composition which is highly responsive to ultrasound [314]. They have achieved a significant enhancement of gene transfer efficiency in cell culture through combined application of ultrasound and magnetic field. Our second generation of magnetic microbubbles appears to have similar properties, is highly responsive to ultrasound and gives excellent contrast in ultrasound imaging [312].",

Being commercially available, magnetofection has become a widely used research tool. Being applicable virtually with any type of nucleic acid and any kind of nonviral or viral gene vector, it can improve the efficacy of gene delivery in many applications. Now, that the benefits and potentials of magnetofection have been highlighted comprehensively it is time to acknowledge that the method is not a solution for any limitation in nucleic acid delivery. After many years of research, conventional forms of delivery have been advanced successfully to clinical trials. Other forms of targeting and other physical methods of delivery are highly promising. To date, side by side comparisons or combinations for example with electroporation, sonoporation, hydroporation, aerosolization, ballistic methods, occlusion of the blood outflow from the target organ or biological targeting are still rare. In the absence of further evidence, any of the named methods needs to be considered as promising as magnetofection is. Electroporation is probably the most advanced method and the efficiency of this method in vitro and in vivo, particularly with non-dividing cells, still needs to be achieved with magnetofection. When compared to all the other physical methods, the major advantage of magnetofection is that it is able to combine simplicity, non-expensiveness, localization of delivery, enhanced efficiency and reduction of incubation time and of vector doses (cited from [138]). The true potential of the method is possibly its amenability to innovation with integrated technologies. Examples are combined magnetic cell separation and nucleic acid delivery for future cell therapies, magnetic positioning of genetically engineered cells for tissue regeneration and tissue engineering and theranostic systems for integrated nucleic acid delivery and multimodal medical imaging. There is plenty of work to be done for years to come.",

The ultrasound was applied using a 6 mm ultrasound probe attached to the Sonitron 2000D device operating at 1 MHz at 2 W cm\u2212 2 and 100% duty cycle for 5 min; e) red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression in mouse vessels after the intrajugular injection of 200 \u03bcl MAALs loaded with 8 \u03bcg RFP plasmid. In this experiment, the magnetic field was generated using the electromagnet that was applied in the biodistribution experiments.",
