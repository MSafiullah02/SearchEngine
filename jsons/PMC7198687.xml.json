Additionally, Hong Kong H3N2 flu killed one million people in 1968\u20131969 (Simonsen et al.1998; Dangi and Jain 2012). From April 16 to April 29, 2018, 1252 (45.4%) specimens were identified by the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System laboratories as influenza A (H3N2) (http://www.who.int). Moreover, in recent years, SIV has attracted much attention owing to its ability to infect humans. Pigs have surface receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses (Ito et al.1998), and influenza viruses from humans and birds can recombine in pigs (Webster et al.1992). Among the various subtypes of SIV, H3N2 and H1N1 strains exist in human populations and cause relatively high morbidity and mortality rates (Horimoto and Kawaoka 2005). Additionally, compared with H1N1, H3N2 infection is associated with human seasonal influenza with a higher epidemic severity index, and its frequency is increasing (Simonsen et al.1997; Thompson et al.2003). Although the pathogenesis of the H3N2 subtype has been extensively studied, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating abnormal host responses are largely unknown.",

            "text": "Most mammalian genomes are transcribed into noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including small ncRNAs (< 200 bp) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs; > 200 bp) (Costa 2010). With the development of high-throughput sequencing, genetic manipulation, and other biotechnologies, many functions of lncRNAs have been discovered. Studies have shown that lncRNAs play important roles in gene transcription, splicing, protein translation, protein localization, stem cell pluripotency, cell structural integrity, heat shock response, and human diseases (Szczesniak and Makalowska 2016). Moreover, lncRNAs have also been shown to have roles in innate immune responses (Carpenter et al.2013; Ilott et al.2014; Carpenter 2016; Jiang et al.2018) and host\u2013pathogen interactions (Barriocanal et al.2014; Ouyang et al.2014; Nishitsuji et al.2016; Qiu et al.2018; Tong et al.2019). Although thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in mammalian genomes, only a few are associated with innate immunity against viral pathogenesis and influenza viruses. Importantly, lncRNAs induced by influenza virus affect several host biological processes and can also regulate infection. In addition, lncRNAs influence the feedback mode of viral infection by mediating metabolism (Wang et al.2017). However, our understanding of the specific functions of lncRNAs in influenza A virus (IAV) infection is still limited.",

            "text": "Traditional studies of host cell responses to influenza infection have mainly focused on protein-coding genes. Recently, several studies have shown that lncRNAs regulate virus replication by mediating host gene expression. For example, the lncRNA NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes by affecting histone modification and significantly promotes IAV replication (Ouyang et al.2014). Additionally, the lncRNA NEAT1, which is induced by influenza virus, is essential for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles and thereby facilitates the expression of antiviral genes, including cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), probably through relocating transcriptional regulator splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (a NEAT1-binding paraspeckle protein) from the IL-8 promoter to the paraspeckles (Imamura et al.2014). Previous studies have also shown that the lncRNA Bst2/BISPR, which is induced by an influenza virus lacking NS1, is unable to block the interferon response. This lncRNA is located in genome close to BST and positively regulates the expression of BST2, but does not affect the expression of other genes adjacent to BST2 (Barriocanal et al.2014). VIN, a large intergenic lncRNA induced by several IAV strains, including H1N1, H3N2, and H7N7, promotes influenza virus replication (Winterling et al.2014). In this study, we found that 6129 lncRNAs and 50,031 mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed. Because several lncRNAs have been identified as modulators in virus-induced host responses, we predicted that these lncRNAs may play crucial roles in regulating the host response to IAV, although the mechanisms require further exploration.",

GO terms were significantly enriched in biological processes, such as RNA processing, cell cycle, and cellular metabolic process, suggesting that lncRNAs induced by H3N2 infection may regulate metabolism and affect H3N2 replication. To date, several studies have suggested that viruses regulate host metabolism to affect virus replication. Influenza virus manipulates sphingolipid metabolism and increases the level of sphingosine kinase 1 to promote virus replication (Vijayan and Hahm 2014). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) requires glycolysis for replication of the viral genome (McArdle et al.2011), and rhinovirus infection results in extensive alterations in cellular metabolism essential for viral replication, including enhancing utilization and uptake of glucose as well as enhancing nucleotide synthesis and lipogenesis (Gualdoni et al.2018). HCMV and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) both induce major metabolic alterations in their host cells, and HCMV profoundly enhances TCA compound levels and alters pathways that generate substrates for lipid metabolism essential for its replication. Moreover, HSV-1 upregulates pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis for its replication (Vastag et al.2011). LncRNAs regulate metabolic enzymes to affect virus replication. The lncRNA ACOD1 is induced in cells infected with various viruses and can bind the metabolic enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, increased its catalytic activity, and facilitate the production of metabolites that promote viral propagation (Wang et al.2017).",

IAV infection plays complex roles in regulating autophagy. Indeed, IAV induces the formation of autophagosomes in rapamycin-treated Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Tanida et al.2008; Zhou et al.2009). Additionally, several viral proteins are involved in the induction of autophagy. For example, M2 protein alone is able to induce the initial steps of autophagosome formation (Gannage et al.2009; Zhou et al.2009; Zhirnov and Klenk 2013), viral HA protein can slightly activate autophagy, and NS1 induces autophagy indirectly by promoting the synthesis of HA and M2 proteins (Zhirnov and Klenk 2013). Moreover, IAV infection inhibits the degradation of autophagosomes by blocking their fusion with lysosomes (Gannage et al.2009). Therefore, IAV likely regulates autophagy through lncRNAs.",
