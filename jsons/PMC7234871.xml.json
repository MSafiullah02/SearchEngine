Consequently, we have reduced the number of attending surgeons and residents working on a daily basis to the minimum required.

This might pose a challenge against the delivery of emergency surgeries and cancer care to our community if this pandemic lasts for a prolonged period long time According to our analysis, reductions of about 20\u201350% in the total number of consultants per team may lead to this situation. Some centers (such as the one stating that keeping only 20% of its staff would be enough) are maybe more resistant to this situation as they do not have a burn unit, nor they attend to trauma patients.",

Only one of the institutions we have contacted maintains its usual activity. This is probably related to the geographical location of this center, in a region where the pandemic is considerably milder compared to other places. Analyzing how the approach to day-care surgery is different amid the departments may lead to interesting conclusions. While some departments have stopped most of their day-care procedures and operate only more severe, inpatient cases; others try to do as many cases as they can in a day-care approach, minimizing admissions. These two alternative options are most likely related to the availability of beds and the severity of the outbreak in each hospital. It has been difficult to obtain data from urgent cases only. It will be interesting to know if urgent cases have actually been reduced. NHS hospitals in England have also been told to suspend all non-urgent elective surgery for at least 3 months from April 15 as a measure to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic [2].",

However, further analysis needs to be conducted in order to confirm that access to oncological surgeries is not being significantly affected. If the current situation keeps worsening, the delay in diagnosis and management of cancer patients could be catastrophic. Our hospital guidance for the pandemic, similar to those used in other institutions, has established three possible levels of alert. They will be applied depending on the severity of this continuously evolving crisis. We are currently in the phase 2 scenario. In the last step (phase 3), ventilators might become hardly available, and life-saving surgeries are the only procedures performed [3]. Some General Surgery departments in China [4] adopted guidelines recommending multidisciplinary approaches and encouraging them to use non-surgical anti-tumor therapies as the first choice for the management of gastrointestinal malignancies. By doing so, even oncological surgeries were reduced to those that are unavoidable. Some of these surgeries can include the absence of therapeutic alternatives to surgery for tumor control, intestinal obstructions not amenable to stenting, or gastrointestinal bleeds not controlled by embolization.",

Suspicious patients were sent to quarantine for 2 weeks. Confirmed positive cases were sent to centralized institutions for surgeryEnvironmental control measures: maximizing hygiene measures, using rapid sequence induction for general anesthesia patients and disinfecting all the ORs with UV lights for at least 30 minStaff protection measures: PPE for surgeries on negative patients included FFP2 (N95) masks, disposable waterproof protective suits, and goggles/facial screens. Isolation screens were added when performing emergency cases and during long procedures",
