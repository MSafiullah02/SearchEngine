In S\u00e3o Paulo State, the first case of CoViD-19 was confirmed on 26 February, the first death due to CoViD-19 was registered on 16 March, on 24 March the S\u00e3o Paulo State authorities implemented the isolation of persons in non-essential activities, which is programmed to end on June 1. The deterministic model used the data collected in S\u00e3o Paulo State to estimate the model parameters to describe the current epidemiological status in the State under isolation. We concluded that the proportion in isolation influenced the number of new cases in around 9 days ahead. We evaluate the suitability of lockdown in S\u00e3o Paulo State and concluded that this extreme measure should be efficient if lower transmission is occurring among isolated persons. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the release proportions of young and elder persons. We evaluated three releases divided in equal proportions elapsed 14 : medRxiv preprint days between releases, and three strategies: the first release occurring on June 1, 15 and 23. We concluded that these three strategies are equivalent (little difference) in reducing the number of hospitalization due to severe CoViD-19 and deaths, due to presenting the effective reproduction number near one. However, if protection actions as using face mask and hygiene (washing hands, for instance) could be massively disseminated in the population, we concluded there health care system may not collapse.",

The rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 (new coronavirus) is due to the fact that this virus can be transmitted by droplets that escape the lungs through coughing or sneezing and infect humans (direct transmission), or they are deposited in surfaces and infect humans when in contact with this contaminated surface (indirect transmission). The virus enters into susceptible persons through the nose, mouth, or eyes, and infects cells in the respiratory tract, being capable to release millions of new viruses. Like all RNA-based viruses, the new coronavirus tends to mutate faster than DNA-viruses, but lower than influenza viruses.",

The reason is that in serious cases due to new coronavirus infection, immune cells overreact and attack the lung cell causing acute respiratory disease syndrome and possibly death. In general, the fatality rate in elder patients (60 years or more) is much higher than the average. However, the isolation as control measure arises an important question: are there reliable strategies to release these isolated persons aiming to avoid the retaken of its original progression of infection?",

The reason to include factor \u03c8 is the reduced capacity of defense mechanism by elder persons (physical barrier, innate and adaptive immune responses, etc.). The force of infection takes into account all virus released by infectious individuals (A y , D 1y , Q 2y , A o , D 1o and Q 2o ), the rate of encounter with susceptible persons, and the capacity to infect them (see [20] [21] ). Additionally, the amount inhaled by susceptible persons can be determinant in the chance of infection and in the prognostic of CoViD-19 [28] . From data collected in S\u00e3o Paulo State from February 26 until May 7, 2020, we fit transmission (\u03b2 y and \u03b2 o ) and fatality (\u03b1 y and \u03b1 o ) rates, the proportions of isolated persons (k y and k o ), and reduction in the transmission rates due to protection actions adopted by people (\u03b5). 1 Once determined these parameters, we study potential scenarios introducing isolation as control mechanisms and subsequent release.",

After this epidemiological week, the notification as SARS initiates decreasing trend, maybe due to increased testing of severe CoViD-19 cases (on March 31, there were 822 cases, but one day earlier, only 66 cases, and around 180 cases a day in the 13 th week). Figure 2 (b) shows this jump up on March 31. This increased number of cases should be explained by more testing among SARS to identify CoViD-19, or by the exponential-like increasing of epidemics in the beginning, or probably by both. Figure 2 (a) shows an unusual jump up when comparing 13 th week (March 22-28) and 14 th week (March 29-April 4), which is not observed in next weeks, suggesting that the isolation decreased the force of dynamics.

In the next 16 th week (April 12-18) there was strong variations in the CoViD-19 cases, maybe due to huge variation in the proportions in isolation 9 days earlier. In the 17 th week (April 19-25), the increased number of cases corresponds to decreased proportions in isolation including weekend (on April 25, Sunday, there was the highest number of cases). This increased trend continued on the next 18 th week (April 26-May 2), when the proportions in isolation fluctuated, but relatively small number of cases was registered during the extended holiday (May 1-3). The behavior observed in the 17 th and 18 th weeks may be the effects of manifestation against isolation occurred on April 18: The peak on April 25 and high number of cases lasting until April 30, that is, 7 to 12 days after the manifestation is the interval with median 9.5 and variation 2.5 (sum of incubation and pre-diseased periods is 9.8).

As expected, R ef = 1 occurs before the peak of epidemics, for this reason the value of R ef lower than 1 also occurs in the ascending phase. This behavior, when there are not interventions, is due to huge number of infectious individuals, which is responsible to infect many susceptible persons, such as inertia maintains object in movement even though there are opposing forces. However, when interventions are acting on a community, Figure 11 (a) shows R ef = 1 occurring just before the peak of epidemics, in the ascending phase. Hence, further interventions, especially release, must take this behavior into account and do not assume that all descending phase is relatively safe. When R ef is lower but near than 1, there is great possibility of rebounding of epidemics when release is initiated.",

The values of for young, elder, and total persons in isolation alone on May 10 are, respectively, 12, 080, 10, 020 and 22, 120, and on May 24, 21, 880, 18, 350 and 39, 980. Hence, the differences between May 24 and 10 are 9, 800, 8, 330 and 17, 860, respectively, for young, elder, and total persons. In isolation followed by lockdown, the number of severe CoViD-19 cases increased from 0 to values given in Table 5 , on May 24. Let us define the reduction in transmission rates among isolated and subsequent lockeddown persons. Among them the transmission rates can be reduced by isolating factor , that is, they are reduced by \u03b2 y = \u03b2 y / and \u03b2 o = \u03b2 o / , and by protection actions factor \u03b5, that is, \u03b2 y = \u03b5\u03b2 y and \u03b2 o = \u03b5\u03b2 o , remembering that \u03b2 y = 0.78 and \u03b2 o = 0.897 (both in days \u22121 ), with R 0 = 9.239. Table 5 shows the values attained on May 24 for different factors of reduction in the transmission rates. With respect to = 1 and \u03b5 = 1 (first row), D 2j , j = y, o, and D 2 = D 2y +D 2o are the difference between values on May 24 and May 10, that is, the number of new cases during this 14 days of lockdown. For other values of and \u03b5, \u2206D 2 is the subtraction of new cases among locked-down persons on May 24 and the new cases among circulating persons without lockdown. Hence, \u2212 and + means advantage or disadvantage of lockdown.",

Table 5 , near one, R 0 = 0.9239, is disadvantageous). We stress that expressive numbers of exposed (E = 734, 000) and pre-diseased (D 1 = 87, 230) persons are transferred to isolation with lockdown, which implies that many peoples are getting sick in their home. For instance, from last row, when there is absolutely not transmission, R 0 = 0, we have 12, 220 new cases among isolated persons, which is exactly the contribution of already infected persons before lockdown. In this case, the avoiding of 5, 640 new cases due to lockdown (31.6% of 17, 860) is desirable, but may bring troubles about releasing strategies later. However, if there is transmission among isolated persons, for instance last but one row R 0 = 0.3696, the number of new cases is 14, 870, and the difference 2, 990 is 16.7% of 17, 860, which increases as R 0 increases. If absence or low intensity of transmission could not be guaranteed, lockdown may bring another trouble besides the increased number of new cases: many elder persons should be infected due to closeness with asymptomatic especially young persons [30] .",

The function f (\u03ba) is determined by calculating the coordinates of the nontrivial equilibrium point P * . For instance, for dengue transmission model, f (s * 1 , s * 2 ) = s * 1 \u00d7 s * 2 , where s * 1 and s * 2 are the fractions at equilibrium of, respectively, humans and mosquitoes [27] . For tuberculosis model considering drug-sensitive and resistant strains, there is not f (x), but s * is solution of a second degree polynomial [29] . From equation (A.10), let us assume that f s * , s * y , s * o = s * y + s * o . Then, we can define the approximated effective reproduction number R ef as R ef = R y s y + R o s o , (A.11) which depends on time, and when attains steady state (R ef = 1), we have s * = 1/R 0 . The basic reproduction number R 0 is the secondary cases produced by one case of infectious person (could be anyone in one of classes harboring virus) in a completely susceptible young and elder persons without control. Let us understand R 1j and R 2j , j = y, o, stressing that the interpretation is the same for both subpopulations, hence we drop out subscript j. To facilitate the interpretation, we consider this infectious person in exposed class E. We assumed that hospitalized persons are not transmitting, but only asymptomatic (A), pre-diseased (D 1 ) and fraction of mild CoViD-19 (Q 2 ) persons.",

Our task is evaluating the transmission among locked-down persons, which are summed with the isolated susceptible persons on May 10, by simulating the system of equations (2), (3), and (4). The boundary conditions on May 10 (denoted by x) is given by equation (8) for all classes with k = 0.9, recalling that in isolated population we assumed that there are only susceptible persons.
