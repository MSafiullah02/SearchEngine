In overview, more than 12 folds have been identified that convey ability to bind glycans [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Sequence divergence after duplication events, starting from an ancestral gene, then led to forming families of homologous proteins. The case study on galectins (\u03b2-galactoside-binding proteins with \u03b2-sandwich fold and a sequence signature responsible for ligand contact [5]) is describing such a network with overlapping and distinct expression profiles [[6], [7], [8]]. This emerging evidence poses the challenge of a complete characterization of the galectins of an organism. It would be a step forward towards delineating rules of network design and providing insights into the functional meaning of sequence variations. In this respect, the galectin fold presents remarkable adaptability for accommodating ligands of different biochemical nature.",

Looking at the assumedly crucial sequence signature for contact to a \u03b2-galactoside, a less dramatic deviation than just described may not necessarily impair glycan binding. For example, the change of a seemingly essential Asn (in position 46 in human galectin-1 (Gal-1)) to Ala at the equivalent position 64 in a fungal (Agrocybe cylindracea) galectin is not detrimental. It is neutralized by a five residue insertion at positions 42\u201346 (with the inserted Asn46 taking the place of the Asn lost at position 64) [13,14]. The structural way how to maintain affinity for lactosides in the conger eel (Conger myriaster) galectin from peritoneal cells (Con-P), although even seven from eight conserved amino acids are replaced as reported in [15], has not yet been characterized. Alternatively, sequence deviation(s) can alter carbohydrate specificity. The Trp81Arg change implemented binding to bi-N-acetylated disaccharides (chitobiose, LacdiNAc) in the third galectin protein (CGL3) from the inky cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea [16]. A unique situation, i.e. a species-dependent loss of lectin activity, is encountered for the galectin-related inter-fiber protein, termed GRIFIN.",

            "text": "This protein has first been described in rat as lens-specific protein [17,18]. It was found in the insoluble fraction of nuclear fiber cells and localized at the interface between adjacent fiber cells, representing about 0.5% of total protein in adult lens. Its gene with an elaborate promoter region to facilitate lens-specific expression is a common constituent of vertebrate genomes [19]. Given this site-specific occurrence and conserved presence among vertebrates, it is exceptional and thus intriguing to see sequence deviations at canonical positions between mammalian and bird/fish GRIFINs. Especially, the equivalent of the already noted Asn46 (in human Gal-1) is turned to Lys in mammalian GRIFINs [17]. As consequence, a bead (lactosylated Sepharose beads) assay revealed no lectin activity for rat GRIFIN [17]. In contrast, GRIFINs from zebrafish [20] and chicken [19] were bona fide lectins. Two reasons prompted us to initiate structural analysis of GRIFINs by studying chicken (C)-GRIFIN: the mentioned plasticity within the galectin fold and our long-term interest to achieve complete crystallographic documentation of galectin structures in an organism. Towards this end, chicken with its (only) seven family members is a favorable model. Since C-GRIFIN shares a deviation from the canonical sequence for lactose binding with mammalian GRIFINs, i.e. the Arg71Val exchange, defining the resulting contact pattern to the ligand will enable a comparison to common features. We here combine crystallographical analysis, reaching atomic resolution, with studies of C-GRIFIN in solution. They were started by determining its quaternary structure, a key feature of proto-type galectin functionality [21].",

The interaction with lactose was monitored in the crystals and also in solution. Here, thermodynamic parameters (by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)) and profiles of hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) in the absence and presence of the ligand were measured. Faced with the conundrum that re-establishing the sequence signature in rat GRIFIN with the Lys-to-Asn reconstitution did not repair the loss of lectin activity [17], we finally probed into the effects of site-specific mutations on C-GRIFIN's carbohydrate-binding activity by a histochemical assay.",

Considering the high local concentration in the lens, we examined the protein status after further increasing the concentration. In sedimentation-velocity experiments at concentrations up to 1.0 mg/mL, C-GRIFIN migrated as single sharp peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 S. In comparison, homodimeric human Gal-1 and CG-1A gave very similar values under these conditions, whereas CG-2 has an S-value of 2.03 \u00b1 0.1 [36]. Frictional ratios among homodimeric proto-type CGs can thus differ when measured by ultracentrifugation. It is about 1.3 for C-GRIFIN and CG-1A but 1.63 for CG-2 [36]. Of note for CG-2, heterogeneity in size distribution had been observed for this protein at 4 mg/mL, with the acquisition of the quaternary structure as trimer of dimers [37]. We proceeded to determine the quaternary structure of C-GRIFIN at concentrations up to 9.0 mg/mL. When reaching the concentration of 9.0 mg/mL in SAXS experiments, the particle distribution function of C-GRIFIN is still in agreement with exclusive presence of a dimer. The ab initio model of the dimer calculated with these data is shown in Fig. 1\n. Its elongated disc shape fits well with the frictional ratio of the dimer as calculated using data obtained by ultracentrifugation. Overall, no evidence for aggregation up to this concentration was obtained. These results thus define the quaternary structure in solution as homodimer with no indication for higher-order aggregates at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL under the given conditions. Structural analysis was next taken to the level of crystallography.",

The short 310 helix in the long loop connecting the S2/F5 strands is also a typical feature.

As consequence, a flat surface is created in this region (Fig. 3). Length, conformation and structure of this loop has been described as a discriminatory factor between human Gal-1 and -3 when interacting with the TF antigen [40], the core 1 disaccharide of mucin-type O-glycosylation (CD176) [41].

Crystal packing of other galectins to a dimer of dimers [42,43], also seen for human Gal-1 in solution in an aprotic solvent [44], that can even be stable in solution [16,[45], [46], [47]] as well as the aggregation of a monomer (murine Gal-9N) to a dimer [48] and Na+-mediated association of the N-terminal lectin domain of murine Gal-4 to a tetramer around the crystallographic four-fold axis [49] indicate potential of galectin domains for building higher-order aggregates under special conditions.

Around the S1 edge, the salt bridge between Arg5/Glu12 and hydrogen bonds between Glu7/Leu9 stabilize the assembly. In the case of the anti-parallel F1 strands, hydrogen bonding between Ser131/Thr135 and also Ser130, Ile134 and Lys136 serve this purpose. Typically for CG homodimers, hydrophobic contacts via Phe6, Ile129, Val132 and Ile134 come into play, too (Fig. 4B). Together, these contacts enable C-GRIFIN to act as cross-linker, reported previously based on haemagglutination assays [19], or as a kind of molecular glue (please see below). The susceptibility to abolish the cell bridging by presence of lactose at 1.0\u20131.5 mM, together with C-GRIFIN's binding to lactose-bearing beads used in affinity chromatography, was indicative of lectin activity.

Per dimer, the number of binding sites of 1.76 \u00b1 0.42 was reached at pH 7.2. It increased to 1.89 \u00b1 0.45 by exchanging the methyl by a 2\u2032-naphthyl group, together with the considerable enhancement of affinity from 140 \u03bcM to 8.6 \u03bcM. Adjusting the pH to 8.5 (in TRIS buffer) lowered ligand loading to well below 1 and also the affinity. At the acidic side, no heat production was observed at pH 5.2 (in sodium acetate). This pH profile with rather sharp decreases in binding activity to both sides corresponded well with assays on human Gal-1 using lactose-bearing beads or surface-immobilized asialofetuin [50,51]. Fittingly, binding sites for lactose in the homodimer were occupied by the ligand in the crystals obtained at pH values of 6.2, 6.5, 8.0 and 8.5, and they remained free when the pH was set to 4.2/4.6.

The resulting rmsd value of this superimposition is 0.263 \u00c5, arguing in favor of a common shape irrespective ligand loading. The contact site in crystals at each pH value is composed of amino acids from \u03b2-strands S4-S6 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the electron density map of the ligand shows a preference for presence of \u03b1-lactose instead of the natural \u03b2-anomer at the reducing end, as shown in Fig. S2, likely by crystallographic contacts. Despite sequence variations among the homodimeric CGs, the canonical contact profile between the protein and lactose is maintained, except for the Arg71Val substitution (Fig. 5\n). As illustrated in this figure, the axial 4\u2032-hydroxyl group of the galactose moiety is involved in hydrogen (H-)bonding with the conserved His46, Asn48 and Arg50 moieties, sequence conservation of Asn59/Glu69 enabling H-bonding with the 6\u2032-hydroxyl group. In addition, the 3\u2032-hydroxyl is in water-mediated contact with Glu32, and C-H/\u03c0 interactions with Trp66 complete the binding pattern for the galactose moiety. Since Trp oxidation to the oxindole impairs ligand binding, as first shown for electrolectin [52], the substantial reactivity of this residue (up to 18.6% after 24 h when exposed to 0.05% hydrogen peroxide [19]) is noteworthy. Deamidation within peptide 58\u201370 (after seven days at 25 \u00b0C/40 \u00b0C reaching 9.2%/13.5% [19]) may also have an impact on the protein's lectin activity, if not protected by bound ligand.",

In C-GRIFIN, this 3-hydroxyl connects by H-bonding with Arg50 and Glu69 (Fig. 5). Val71, taking the place of the Arg residue conserved in homodimeric CGs and zebrafish GRIFIN, is not able to engage in H-bonding. When for example compared to CG-2 [13], the Arg71Val substitution causes a loss in H bonding to this hydroxyl for C-GRIFIN. This exchange of an amino acid, which is shared by mammalian GRIFINs, yet does not appear to be detrimental for lactose binding. Considering the pH dependence, contribution to affinity by Glu69 could be reduced by an increasing degree of its protonation. Its pKa was calculated to be 4.6 so that a loss of enthalpy generation may ensue at this site at low pH. Going above neutral pH, His46 (at pKa 6.75) may be a factor in the observed affinity decrease at pH 8.5, whose origin appears to be more complex than a single-site alteration.",

This marked enhancement of affinity by presence of the sulfate group is in contrast to 3\u2032-sialylation, as observed in cell binding [19]. When comparing the binding mode of the negatively charged lactose derivative to CG-8N, reported previously [31], with the situation in C-GRIFIN, a lack of interaction with Arg57 and also Glu45 may have an influence on this grading of affinity to the lactoside and its 3\u2032-modified derivatives. Binding-site modeling with the 3\u2032-O-sulfated lactose as ligand provides a set of putative contacts to the sulfate group that can adopt two orientations (Fig. S3). Interestingly, these sets include contacts to Asn48 and Arg50 as well as Trp66, albeit not with the same conformer, as is the case for the N-domains of Gal-4 and -8 [54,55]: Gal-4C, in contrast, appears to employ a transient contact to Trp256 for the slight affinity increase caused by the presence of the 3\u2032-sulfate group [56].",

            "text": "When comparing in detail positions of amino acid of the ligand-free and -loaded subunits of the C-GRIFIN homodimer, one ligand-dependent event of reorganization was revealed (Fig. 6\nA). The side chain of Arg50 moves toward the glucose ring into the direction of Trp66 from the position of pointing to Asn48, in this place also in crystallographic interactions with Ser54 and Glu78 of a symmetry-related protein. Interestingly, the accommodation of ligand into the N-terminal lectin domain of human Gal-9 triggers such a movement of the side chain of Arg87 to let its NH1 become hydrogen bonded with O2 of the glucose moiety [57]. The movement in C-GRIFIN was also seen in crystals obtained at pH 6.2 (Fig. 6B). When C-GRIFIN in solution bound to lactose on beads and was tryptically fragmented, peptides covering the amino acid stretches of 26\u201352 and 58\u201370 had sufficient interactions to maintain their binding during repeated washes and could be eluted [19]. This result is in line with the contact pattern seen in crystals. Taking analysis of C-GRIFIN and lactose binding again to the level of a solution in this report, measuring extent and profile of HDX in the absence and presence of ligand can identify the contact site. Beyond furnishing a sensitive means to do so, measuring the impact of ligand presence on amide deuteration can also detect alterations in this parameter at other sites. This has recently been accomplished for CG-8N when introducing application of this method to galectins [31]. Measured for homodimeric human Gal-1 and CG-1B/2 by small angle neutron scattering and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, respectively [44,58,59], ligand binding can lead to shape changes into both directions, depending on the type of protein. We thus performed HDX experiments with C-GRIFIN.",

The number of detected peptides was 94. The size of the panel ensured complete sequence coverage at a redundancy of 7.25. This value denotes the average frequency of a distinct amino acid position covered by the panel of identified peptides. Presence of lactose reduced deuterium uptake into amides, predominantly in the sequence stretch covering canonical amino acids, with strong impact especially on the peptide 55\u201361 (Fig. 8\n). Changes seen at position 1\u201317 and 21\u201338 should be viewed with caution, because no confirmation by overlapping peptides was possible. The quantitative data on the level of peptides given in Fig. 8 can now be introduced by color coding to the crystal structure.

Next, the structure of mammalian GRIFIN at position 48 was mimicked by the Asn48Lys mutation. Absence of Asn at the equivalent site leads to knocking down lactose-dependent binding for human Gal-1 noted above. This alteration was combined with an Arg50Val exchange, aimed at further harming hydrogen bonding to the 4\u2032-hydroxyl group of the galactose moiety. Of note, this pair of two sequence deviations is encountered in chicken galectin-related protein that has no affinity for lactose (C-GRP [63]). To complete our series, a triple mutant was engineered.

Of course, other alterations present in mammalian GRIFIN, too, could make their presence felt, because reconstitution at three sites of rat GRIFIN (i.e. Val46Phe, Lys47Asn, Val70Arg) did not repair the defect in lectin activity [17]. Furthermore, the examples of long-range effects of the R111H/C2S mutations in human Gal-1, causing a shift in the positions of His52/Trp68 [13], and of the SNP-based Phe19Tyr change in a natural variant of human Gal-8 [64] attest remarkable plasticity and sensitivity for subtle changes. In this respect, it will be very informative to have the crystal structures of CG-3 and also of the C-terminal domain of CG-8 available, which are closest to C-GRIFIN in the phylogenetic family-tree diagram [19].",

In transgenic mouse lenses, chemical cross-linking of a tagged version of human \u03b1A-crystallin led to detecting GRIFIN in the complexes, supported by co-elution of the two proteins in gel filtration at a peak around 600 kDa [35]. The KD-value measured in filtration binding (Scatchard) assays with murine \u03b1L-crystallin was 13.6 \u00b1 5.3 \u03bcM (9.4 \u03bcM) with a stoichiometry of 0.4 \u00b1 0.08 (0.34) GRIFIN monomer per crystallin monomer (0.25 \u00b1 0.01 for bovine crystallin) [35].

Intriguingly, di- or tetrameric (plant) lectins of the \u03b2-sandwich fold are known to assist in ordered packaging. This is an intracellular role of leguminous lectins. Their association to storage proteins destined to fill protein bodies depends either on protein-glycan (for glycosylated vicilin) or protein-protein interactions (for non-glycosylated vicilin and legumin) [70,71]. This dual reactivity is not uncommon, a lectin from slime molds even employing two contact sites for a glycan and for a protein to fulfill its role in ordered cell migration [72]. To take the comparison to GRIFIN further, the leguminous lectins can bind to protein body membranes [73]. The finding of an association of GRIFIN and \u03b1-crystallin with the plasma membrane of lens fiber cells [17,74] has led to assuming an influence on \u201ccell elongation and suture formation during lens development\u201d [35]. The homodimeric design as well as high degree of stability and rigidity can thus be molecular means of GRIFINs for helping to build and/or maintain the high-order organization of lens proteins. Bridging of counterreceptors, an often encountered theme in translating glycan-encoded messages by lectins [8,21,75], will in this context likely engender stability of aggregates in three dimensions. Whether and how GRIFINs and their yes/no variability of lectin activity in proteins from different vertebrates actually play a role in these processes remains to be clarified. Equally important, mapping the course of GRIFIN expression and localization in lens development is required to define physiological role(s) of respective proteins with/without lectin activity.",

The contact profile to lactose compensated the Arg71Val deviation and maintained the enthalpically driven nature of binding. Ligand association caused a shift in the position of the side chain of Arg50, the only observed structural change in crystals. In solution, monitoring HDX in peptic fingerprints at 100% sequence coverage, too, confirmed location of the binding site and did not record any significant ligand-dependent change. Localization of contact site(s) for ligands and monitoring for an impact of the association on solvent accessibility of protein regions are the strengths of this technique [31,76]. Implementing the Asn48Lys change, a hallmark of mammalian GRIFINs, made binding of this mutant protein to tissue sections rather insensitive to lactose presence, intimating this position to be a key site for interactions. This result and the presented structural informations build a solid foundation to proceed in the quest to understand GRIFIN's role as lens protein not present, for example, in the retina [17,19,77]. Moreover, they are a step toward completing the structural analysis of the galectin network in a model organism, i.e. in chicken with its seven members.",

Based on quantitative data of HDX (please see Fig. 8 for details), the three sequence stretches exhibiting reduced deuterium uptake in the presence of lactose are highlighted by coloring (in red for peptide 55\u201361, showing the highest difference; in brown for peptides 43\u201354 and 62\u201378), the C-GRIFIN monomer with the respective regions and amino acids shown from two perspectives (C,D).",

Wild-type C-GRIFIN strongly stained the thick loops (tl), distal tubules (dt) and the apical part of the proximal tubules (pt) (A). Binding was also detected in the collecting ducts (cd) and in the peripheral collecting tubules (ct). Presence of 200 mM lactose led to complete abolishment of binding of C-GRIFIN (inset to A). The introduction of the Trp66Leu mutation led to marked decrease of staining, with only weak signals in the thick loops (tl), distal tubules (dt) and the collecting tubules (ct) (B). Very weak but significant staining was seen in the proximal tubules (pt). Incubation with 200 mM lactose either slightly reduced signal intensity (thick loops (tl), distal tubules (dt), collecting tubules (ct)) or led to complete inhibition of binding (proximal tubules (pt)) (inset to B). In contrast, the Asn48Lys mutant led to very strong staining (C). No inhibitory effect was seen in the presence of lactose (inset to C). Combining this mutation with an Arg50Val substitution (to obtain the Asn48Lys/Arg50Val double mutant) markedly decreased signal intensity in all areas of the section (D), with no effect by presence of 200 mM lactose (inset to D). The concentration of biotinylated proteins was 12 \u03bcg/mL. The corresponding category of signal intensity is given in the bottom left part of each microphotograph, according to the following grading system: -, no staining; (+), very weak but significant staining; +, weak staining; ++, medium-level staining; +++, strong staining; ++++, very strong staining.
