There is a diverse range of SARS-CoV-2 detection rates in reported studies, 24 with uncertainty as to the optimal sampling strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis and 25 monitoring. 26 Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing 27 respiratory sampling strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The inclusion 28 criteria were studies that assessed at least two respiratory sampling sites 29 (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum) in participants with COVID-30 19. The percentage positive tests were compared between sampling modalities by 31 constructing a Z-test assuming independence and using the standard errors obtained 32 from the random effects meta-analysis. 33 Findings: From 1039 total studies, we identified 11 studies that met our inclusion 34 criteria, with SARS-CoV-2 testing results from a total of 3442 respiratory tract 35 specimens. Compared to nasopharyngeal swab sampling, sputum testing resulted in 36 significantly higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection while oropharyngeal swab 37 testing had lower rates of viral RNA detection. Earlier sampling after symptom onset 38 was associated with improved detection rates, but the differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA 39 detection by sampling method was consistent regardless of the duration of symptoms.",
