Recent reports have suggested that these viruses may be associated with more severe diseases, and in particular gastroenteritis, but as yet there is no clear evidence to support this [Macnaughton and Davies, 19811 . Several reports have analyzed the extent of infections in various populations in America and Europe by estimates of HCV antibodies in sera from patients and volunteers [Bradburne and Somerset, 1972; Candeias et al, 1970; Cavallaro and Monto, 1970 ; Hamre and Beem, 1972; Hendley et al, 1972; Hovi et al, 1979 ; Kaye et al, 1971; McIntosh et al, 1970; Zakstelskaya et al, 19721 . A number of assays have been used, including neutralization, complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, and radioimmunoassay. The numbers of subjects with significant HCV antibody in their sera varied considerably depending on the population studied, time of assay, assay system used, and method used to determine significant levels of antibody. In one report most of the adult population was found to have serum antibodies to HCV OC43 as detected by radioimmunoassay [Hovi et al, 19791 indicating that infections with theseviruses are very common.",

Our results show that clinical or subclinical HCV infections in an adult population from the Basrah region of Southern Iraq are widespread with a high proportion, 91% of this population, having serum antibodies to HCV 229E and/or OC43 group viruses. However, it is not clear how frequently individuals are infected with HCVs, as we do not know how long HCV serum antibodies remain after infection and how much antibody is produced by natural HCV infections. Serum samples were taken during the winter when HCV infections have been reported to occur most frequently [McIntosh et al, 1970; Cavallaro and Monto, 1970; McIntosh, 1974; Monto, 19741 . A similar prevalence of HCV antibodies was detected in sera of volunteers at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury, England. However, in this study a smaller number of serum samples was examined and they were taken randomly throughout the year. These results imply that HCV infections occur frequently in both populations. We cannot say at present that HCV infections are less common in Iraq than in England, as considerable variation has been reported in HCV antibody prevalence in sera depending upon when samples are taken [Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971; Monto, 19741. Most previous studies have revealed no antigenic relationship between the HCV 229E and HCV OC43 group viruses [McIntosh et al, 1969; Monto, 1974; Macnaughton et al, 19811 , although generally only reactions involving external antigens were examined in these studies. However, one group has described an antigenic relationship between these virus groups [Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971; Bradburne and Somerset, 19721 , which may reflect the type of sera used and the presence of contaminating serum and other components [Kraaijeveld et al, 1980al . In our study we observed a strong correlation between the amount of antibody to the two HCV groups in individual Iraqi sera. This may be due to the detection of antibody directed against antigenically related internal antigens: such antigens are present in significant amounts in human sera (Macnaughton, unpublished results). However, further studies are required into both the antigenic relatedness of HCV antigens and into the nature, duration, and role of HCV serum antibodies produced during HCV infection, in order to resolve this problem.",
