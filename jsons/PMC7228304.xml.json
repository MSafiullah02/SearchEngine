In the management of the health crisis, the identification of paucisymptomatic patients is emerging as a crucial factor in order to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. In the centers that are facing this emergency, a significant number of patients presenting anosmia and ageusia associated with fever (> 37.5\u00b0C) as onset symptoms are being detected. This minor and nonspecific symptomatology can represent the only manifestation of the disease.",

Interestingly, in COVID\u201019 patients ageusia and anosmia are not accompanied by nasal obstruction or other rhinitis symptoms. Therefore, this is probably due to the direct damage of the virus on the olfactory and gustatory receptors.5 Currently, it is not possible to determine whether there will be a full recovery of the olfactory and gustatory functions or how long it will take.",

In a non\u2010negligible number of patients, especially if paucisymptomatic, ageusia and anosmia can represent the first or the only symptomatology manifestation. It will be important, when feasible, to obtain olfactory and gustatory testing data on patients with confirmed COVID\u201019 testing to provide quantitative data on the incidence and severity of these sensory losses. Finally, understanding mechanisms of sensorineural olfactory loss with coronavirus infections might provide novel insights into aspects of viral pathogenesis.",
