Since the first case of MERS infection was reported on May 20, 186 people were found to be infected, 36 of whom died, while a total of 16,693 were quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Thousands of schools were closed at the peak of the outbreak; in addition, as people became more concerned and afraid, they frequently avoided public places, including markets, theaters, and restaurants, which took a heavy toll on the national economy (Byun, 2015).",

Traditional news media such as newspapers and television, also avoided providing sufficient information about MERS at the request of the government and the medical profession. In this situation, the majority of South Koreans began to rely on social network sites (SNSs) as an alternative source of information about MERS. When people are caught up in the outbreak of an infectious disease, their information needs tend to increase (Bults et al., 2011, Li et al., 2014, Wong and Sam, 2010). Althaus and Tewksbury (2000) suggested that audiences might shift toward the web and away from newspapers and television if the web meets their information needs better than traditional news media or if it satisfies demands that cannot be fulfilled by traditional media. In addition, individuals seek out the web, because it often provides an unfiltered, up-to-date line of communication and information that cannot be found elsewhere (Johnson & Kaye, 2010). SNSs have been defined as web-based services that allow individuals to build knowledge and disseminate information within a bounded system (Boyd & Ellison, 2007). Thus, in South Korea, SNSs became an attractive avenue through which to communicate with and learn from others about MERS.",

However, researchers have not explored the effect of communicating information about infectious diseases via SNSs on disease-preventive behaviors. In particular, little is known about the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effects of SNS communication on preventive behaviors. In addition, when people communicate via SNSs, they not only read messages posted by others, but also send messages to others (Sundar, 2004). However, despite this bidirectional nature of SNS communication, few studies have been conducted to examine the effects of both expression and reception of SNS messages in the context of an infectious disease outbreak.",

Traditional news media have been identified as a dominant source of health information in public health risk events (Hobbs, Kittler, Fox, Middleton, & Bates, 2004). They provide a wide range of highly segmented audiences with critical information for reducing harm or even resolving the crisis (Hooker, Leask, & King, 2012). However, the proliferation of SNSs has changed the way people access information, such that they typically no longer need to rely solely on the government or traditional news media as their primary information source during a public health emergency. For example, Twitter was primarily used as a public sphere for the exchange of information, opinions and experiences among people during the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010, Signorini et al., 2011). Additionally, at the peak of the flu pandemic, H1N1 discussions were conducted within more than 500 Facebook groups (Davies, 2009). In May 2013, a measles outbreak began in the Netherlands, and Mollema et al. (2015) analyzed the tweets sent via Twitter during this outbreak. They found that individuals used Twitter not only to inform others about the measles outbreak and preventive measures such as vaccination but also to express their frustration regarding persons who did not vaccinate because of religious reasons.",

According to the media system dependency theory, the public\u2019s dependency on media tends to intensify at times of major crises (Ball-Rokeach & DeFleur, 1976). However, when information is not readily available from traditional news media, many individuals serve as information producers and disseminators themselves in order to build alternative means of information exchange (Tai & Sun, 2007). For example, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, Chinese people heavily utilized the Internet and short message services to exchange information not available from the mainstream media, before the Chinese government allowed full disclosure of information on SARS.",

However, not all individuals provide helpful and accurate information; in fact, SNSs are often used for spreading misinformation and false rumors in an emerging pandemic (Morozov, 2009). For example, Oyeyemi, Gabarron, and Wynn (2014) analyzed the messages on Twitter during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and found that most tweets and retweets included false information and that this had a much larger reach than truthful information. Gu et al. (2014) also found that 84% of the rumors regarding H7N9 outbreaks were disseminated and transmitted by social media during the outbreaks in China. The spreading of rumors and misinformation via social media can cause panic among people and further lead to social chaos during an infectious disease emergency.",

With the ubiquity and immediacy of SNSs, information regarding a public health crisis can be rapidly provided through them. Ding and Zhang (2010) found that students from a university in China first reported the outbreak of the H1N1 flu via SNSs, personal blogs, and discussion forums. This information was quickly spread online among the general public. Additionally, SNSs are perceived as more credible than traditional news media for obtaining crisis information in some cases (Jin, Liu, & Austin, 2014). Thus, SNSs can be useful for the rapid identification and prompt management of infectious disease outbreaks (Yang et al., 2013).",

For instance, Mou and Lin (2014) examined whether the public\u2019s use of social media was related to any forms of prevention action in relation to food safety in China. Their findings showed that the use of microblog or Weibo in China was positively associated with public awareness of a series of food safety incidents and factual awareness, in addition to preventive actions regarding food risks. However, in the case of infectious disease outbreaks, the impact of using SNSs on people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors has been largely overlooked (Lin, Savoia, Agboola, & Viswanath, 2014). Given that SNSs have been recognized as useful communication tools to raise awareness during an infectious disease outbreak (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010, Ding and Zhang, 2010, Liu and Kim, 2011), it is reasonable to assume that communication via SNSs of disease-related information influences people\u2019s perceptions, concerns, and behaviors in relation to the outbreak.",

In other words, SNSs allow users not only to receive messages, but also to send out their thoughts and ideas to their social networks. Therefore, through SNSs, the public can play a critical role in message expression such as creating content, transmitting information, and amplifying or commenting on traditional news stories during public health crises (Chew & Eysenbach, 2010).",

Pennebaker and Beall (1986) suggested that \u201cwriting about earlier traumatic experience was associated with both short-term increases in physiological arousal and long-term decreases in health problems\u201d (p. 280). Researchers have proved that numerous therapeutic interventions using the writing paradigm can lead to various health benefits (see Pennebaker, 1997a). Two theories have been proposed to explain the mechanisms by which writing exerts its positive effects. The inhibition theory holds that a great deal of stress goes into constraining thoughts, feelings, or behaviors regarding an emotional upheaval, and that such stress may be reduced by disclosing these experiences (Pennebaker, 1989). Moreover, the cognitive change theory asserts that writing helps individuals organize their thoughts and feelings about traumatic experiences, and create more coherent or meaningful narratives about the events in their lives (Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999). Both theories share the idea that writing helps relieve the stress or other difficulties associated with repression, and make sense of a chaotic emotional experience.",

Some scholars have argued that message expression has important effects on the message producer, because it relies on a self-reflective process and extensive cognitive activity (Blumler and Katz, 1974, Chaffee and Schleuder, 1986, Eveland, 2001). While the reception of messages is generally a passive activity, message construction requires cognitive elaboration, as one considers not only what one wishes to express, but also the way in which that expression is likely to be received (Eveland, 2001, Eveland, 2004). Indeed, after one has expressed a message, the perception of its meaning can change through the awareness that others will read it. This process, also called reasoning, refers to mental elaboration or collective consideration, and it encompasses both intrapersonal and interpersonal ways of thinking (Cho et al., 2009, Shah et al., 2007). The very process of writing out one\u2019s thoughts can exert their impact on the message writer (Pennebaker, 1997b, Pingree, 2007). Specifically, message composers can be influenced by their own message in a variety of ways, for instance, by mentally elaborating on what they expect that the message will mean to others, how they expect readers to react and respond to it, and by preemptively preparing their own responses (Mclaughlin et al., 2016).",

Given the bidirectional nature of the online communication environment, the influence of SNS messages should be examined from this expression-effects perspective. In other words, the effects of message expression, including the individual\u2019s reformulation of the message and the subsequent dissemination of their personal thoughts on it, should be explored in the participation-driven realm of SNSs (Nekmat, 2012). Adopting an expression-effects paradigm in the context of SNS communication during an infectious disease outbreak, allows us to assume that expressing information via SNSs influences the information producer\u2019s cognitive characteristics and the intention to participate in preventive behaviors. SNSs have become not only an important source of health information during epidemics, but also a medium for expressing anxiety and discussing concerns about the disease (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010, Davies, 2009, Tausczik et al., 2012). Prior studies found that individuals expressed their perceptions, concerns, and behaviors by posting relevant messages on SNSs during infectious disease outbreaks (Mollema et al., 2015, Signorini et al., 2011). Thus, it is necessary to examine the potential effects of expressing information via SNSs on the information producer in the context of the MERS outbreak in South Korea. To do so, we hypothesize that expressing MERS-related information will affect self-efficacy, perceived risk, and precautionary behavioral intentions in response to the MERS outbreak. Specifically, this study focuses on the effectiveness of SNS communication in promoting intentions to engage in handwashing and cough etiquette, as these were identified as key preventive behaviors in MERS-prevention guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2015). Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed.H1Expressing MERS-related information will be positively related to self-efficacy for MERS (H1a) and perceived threat of MERS (H1b).\nH2Expressing MERS-related information will be positively related to handwashing intention (H2a) and cough etiquette intention (H2b).\n",

Health communication research has traditionally been dominated by a reception-effects paradigm in which most effects of communication are conceived as a consequence of informational or persuasive message reception (Fishbein & Cappella, 2006). In the case of an infectious disease outbreak, there is substantial evidence to support this message reception-effect perspective. According to results from 36 national surveys in the United Kingdom, exposure to media coverage or advertising about swine flu (H1N1 virus) increased not only people\u2019s perceived efficacy, but also their adoption of recommended preventive behaviors during the early stages of the outbreak (Rubin, Potts, & Michie, 2010). The effects of receiving information regarding an infectious disease outbreak can be replicated, or even be more substantial, in the context of SNS communication. SNSs usage increases during a health crisis event, as individuals seek information about the event itself and check on their social networks such as family and friends (Faustino, Liu, & Jin, 2012). Furthermore, SNSs users are likely to be exposed to messages that affect their perception and preventive behaviors related to health risks and the crisis event. Vos and Buckner (2015) found that SNS messages mainly consisted of sense-making messages to educate about the nature of the risk, and efficacy messages to encourage appropriate responses in the 2013 outbreak of the H7N9 virus. In a similar line, it seems plausible that receiving MERS-related information via SNSs stimulates increased self-efficacy, perceived threat, and preventive behavioral intentions during South Korea\u2019s MERS outbreak. Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed.H3Receiving MERS-related information will be positively associated with self-efficacy for MERS (H3a) and perceived threat of MERS (H3b).\nH4Receiving MERS-related information will be positively associated with handwashing intention (H4a) and cough etiquette intention (H4b).\n",

Understanding how individuals experience and respond to an infectious disease outbreak can be derived from the extended parallel process model (EPPM) (Witte, 1992, Witte, 1994). The EPPM has been widely employed in predicting preventive behaviors during infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., Balicer et al., 2010, Siu, 2008, Zhang et al., 2015). It posits two important determinants of willingness to undertake preventive health behaviors: self-efficacy and perceived threat (Witte, 1992, Witte, 1994). When both self-efficacy and perceived threat are high, individuals are likely to employ recommended preventive behaviors to avoid threat in a danger control process (Shi & Smith, 2016).",

Individuals\u2019 beliefs about their capabilities influence their behavior, such as what they choose to do or how they respond, in order to effectively manage situations (Bandura, 1990). People with low self-efficacy tend to feel powerless and fatalistic (Solomon, 2003), which makes them less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (Crowell & Emmers-Sommer, 2001). Self-efficacy has been also identified as a strong predictor of preventive behaviors during outbreaks of infectious diseases. For example, perceived self-efficacy was associated with taking preventive measures during the 2009 influenza pandemic in the Netherlands (Bults et al., 2011). As a similar concept to that of self-efficacy, perceived behavioral control was an important predictor of SARS-preventive behaviors among working adults in Hong Kong and Canada (Cheng & Ng, 2006). In addition, self-efficacy beliefs were positively associated with intentions to perform frequent handwashing and sanitizing in the context of a campus influenza outbreak (Kim & Niederdeppe, 2013).",

In general, people tend to change their behaviors, including specific public health behaviors (e.g., preventive actions), when they perceive threats or risks, or experience fears (Umeh, 2004). In other words, perceived threat can facilitate protective motivation, thereby increasing behavioral intentions to engage in health-promoting behaviors such as condom use, seat belt use, or breast self-examination (Umeh, 2004). Supporting this suggestion, perceived threat has been shown to be a critical factor in predicting disease-preventive behaviors during infectious disease outbreaks. A review of literature on the SARS, avian influenza (H5N1), and swine influenza (H1N1) pandemics found that perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases were important predictors of the preventative behaviors recommended against them (Bish & Michie, 2010).",

PMT provides a potentially useful framework for understanding how communicating about an infectious disease outbreak via SNSs affects disease-preventive behavioral intentions through cognitive processes (self-efficacy and perceived threat). For example, during an outbreak of a new infectious disease, communicating relevant information via SNSs can influence the communicator's self-efficacy regarding the disease and perceived threat of the disease, thereby influencing their intentions to adopt preventive measures. Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed to explore how self-efficacy and perceived threat mediate the relationships between SNS communication and preventive behavioral intentions in the context of South Korea's MERS outbreak.H7The relationships between expressing MERS-related information and handwashing intention, and cough etiquette intention were mediated by self-efficacy for MERS (H7a) and perceived threat of MERS (H7b).\nH8The relationships between receiving MERS-related information and handwashing intention, and cough etiquette intention were mediated by self-efficacy for MERS (H8a) and perceived threat of MERS (H8b).\n",

Specifically, the chi-square statistic assesses the magnitude of discrepancy between the hypothesized covariance matrix and the observed covariance matrix (Hu & Bentler, 1999). A nonsignificant value of chi-square is usually accepted as evidence of a good model fit. Other model fit indices are categorized into incremental and absolute indices. The most commonly used incremental indices are the CFI and the TLI. Both measure the proportionate improvement in model fit by comparing the hypothesized model with the less restricted baseline model (Byrne, 2012). CFI and TLI values of 0.95 or greater are indicative of a good model (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The RMSEA and the SRMR belong to the category of absolute indices of fit and determine how well the hypothesized model fits the sample data (Byrne, 2012). RMSEA values under 0.08 and under 0.06 for SRMR are considered good model fits (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Based on the cutoff criteria summarized above, our proposed model presented a reasonably good fit to the data: \u03c72 = 2.60, df = 1, p = 0.11, RMSEA = 0.04 (90% CI = 0.00 to 0.10), CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.94, and SRMR = 0.01.",

            "text": "SNSs have become common spaces for individuals to interact and exchange information during infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, SNSs function as alternative information sources when full disclosure of information to the public is delayed or prohibited. In addition to these roles, this study highlights the effects of SNS conversations on public risk perceptions and preventive behaviors. In light of these results, public health officials and communication professionals need to use SNSs in order to effectively manage the social and economic disruptions caused by an infectious disease outbreak. Specifically, SNSs monitoring tools can enable public health organizations to understand more about what diverse social groups are saying about an infectious disease outbreak, to identify information needs, and to adjust their messages accordingly. In order to strategically optimize these tools, the application of theory-grounded models deserves careful consideration. For example, the blog-mediated crisis communication model (Jin & Liu, 2010) and the social-mediated crisis communication model (Austin, Liu, & Jin, 2012) can help to better understand how people provide, receive, and/or share crisis information via SNSs.",
