To increase the number of ventilators available for critically ill patients, our hospital downsized surgical activity and adopted a sharing schedule with only 3 operating theaters out of the 32 kept running. One theatre was dedicated to urgent COVID-19 patients, one to urgent non COVID-19 confirmed patients (24/7), and one to 48-hour-deferrable patients (a.k.a. UPurgent procedure -Group, see Table 1 ). Although, in Strasbourg, we ensured a tight compliance with the \"Recommendations on Elective Surgery\" for negative patients and Furthermore, a well-standardized telemedicine system allowed comprehensive discussion with patients and their relatives regarding management options and informed consent; the consent process proved particularly useful in shielding elderly people and limiting their inpatient stay to the strict minimum.",

The scientific literature shows that biosignatures and 3-Tesla MRI with spectroscopic analysis of multiple regions of interest can be highly reliable [3] [4] [5] , but no randomized studies have ever compared their safety and effectiveness versus standard-of-care surgical biopsy, and no proof of validity for this approach exists.

This approach yielded clinical and logistical advantages: despite the pandemic, Finally, it should be noted that, in a very few instances, the impossibility of proceeding with timely radical resection led to a discussion of risk/benefit ratios and futility of care within our COVID-19 Ethics Board.

On the one hand, we treated all those patients requiring prompt surgical intervention as if they were positive; full personal protection equipment (PPE) consisting of FFP2 tight facemasks, visors, double gowning and triple gloving was religiously adopted. On the other hand, we meticulously tested all new admissions amenable for 48-hour deferral, and awaited the results of their swabs before to theatre. Of note, in the consent form for confirmed COVID-19-negative patients admitted to our hospital we added the risk of: a) infection with SARS-CoV-2, and b) medical complications related to severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19.",

While this strategy has the drawback of only minimally reducing bed capacity in the neurosurgical ward, it will have several practical advantages: a) rebooting surgical activity by creating new ICU beds; b) streamlining inpatient/outpatient pathways, with rapid referral to rehabilitation units; and c) strengthening our bond and cooperation with ICU specialists and all other surgical specialties in our hospital.",
