FRBs are defined as \u201cindividual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event. FRBs modify the future risk of harm\u201d [2\u2022, 3].",

Epidemiologists determined that the trigger event was the zoonotic infection of a small child in rural Guinea in December 2013, setting off multiple extended chains of infection [7\u20139]. EVD spread rapidly to neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. These three countries with widespread and intense transmission accounted for 99.9 % of the total EVD cases; however, several dozen additional cases were reported across seven other nations on three continents [5\u2022, 10]. This international geographic footprint, with cases diagnosed in a total of ten nations, qualified the outbreak as the only Ebola \u201cpandemic\u201d in history. Given the unprecedented escalation in EVD cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 8, 2014 [11], a designation that would remain in force for 20 months until it was discontinued on March 29, 2016 [12].",

Counterintuitively, during the 2013\u20132016 outbreak, fleeing actually increased Ebola disease spread and EVD mortality for four reasons. First, in some instances, the ill were left behind, abandoned without care or support, thus diminishing their chances for survival [39\u2022\u2022]. Second, some persons with acute illness chose to flee due to fear of being identified and transported to an ETU. These persons were infectious and invariably placed anyone with whom they traveled or lodged at high risk. Third, quite insidiously, population movements included an admixture primarily made up of persons who were well but with an occasional infected individual who started the journey asymptomatic while incubating the virus. These migrating groups unwittingly brought Ebola infection with them. Even as they attempted to escape from disease and stigma, these groups became vectors of infection, sometimes introducing EVD into new regions based on their movements. Ladner and colleagues conducted sophisticated genomic analyses demonstrating how populations migrating from Liberia actually \u201creintroduced\u201d the Ebola virus back into Guinea in multiple waves [51]. Fourth, the classic analysis of the \u201ccoupled contagion dynamics of fear and disease\u201d illustrates that, in the case of infectious diseases, fleeing actually increases risks for viral transmission [4\u2022].",

Survivors were widely believed to harbor infection and the post-Ebola somatic symptoms reinforced this misperception [29\u2022\u2022, 52, 58, 76]. Based on misguided fear of contagion, some survivors lost their jobs or were unable to sell their products in the local marketplace [24\u2022, 29\u2022\u2022]. In some instances, discrimination escalated to levels where survivors were forced to divorce, banned from public places or religious gatherings, victimized by acts of interpersonal violence, or even banished from the community [29\u2022\u2022]. Heaped upon the trauma of experiencing EVD illness and the loss of family members to the disease, Rabelo and team [29\u2022\u2022] described a harsh homecoming marked by ostracism, rejection, isolation, humiliation, and exclusion. Unable to regain their lives and livelihoods, survivors were very likely to experience symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [29\u2022\u2022, 75\u2022\u2022, 79]. Recognition of the extreme difficulties faced by persons attempting to return to their home communities following discharge from the ETUs, CDC and other humanitarian actors developed \u201creintegration\u201d and support programs to assist survivors [80, 81].",

EVD survivors tell us that the early message that EVD kills everyone that gets it was one that contributed to the spread.Recognize that communities that endured unresolved trauma are more likely to respond to the cumulative effects of traumatic events. In Liberia, the dead bodies in the street from EVD were eerily similar to dead bodies from the civil war. Peacetime is the time to address past psychological trauma.Attend to the social fabric of the society. Evidence from SARS and the EVD outbreak shows that communities where social cohesion and trust were high did a good job of pulling together, following basic norms about keeping safe. Those communities in Liberia that didn\u2019t believe the government tended to be the ones that denied, often at their peril, the reality of EVD.Create a robust health-care system that engenders trust and attenuates fear. The global health community ought to attend to those countries with weak health-care systems since they can and will end up exporting the next infectious epidemic.Devise communication and awareness-raising strategies, behavioral interventions, risk governance, and community engagement approaches that can diminish the disease impact of FRBs in the future pandemics.\n",

The corollary is that fear and fear reactions can also be manipulated to amplify risks (as what happens in acts of terrorism).Creating an operational definition of FRBs is an important step toward quantification, detection, monitoring, and timely modification.FRBs can be modeled and used for scenario development and complex action planning in the context of risk governance.To the extent that risk-elevating FRBs can be prevented, mitigated, or modified, harm (morbidity, mortality, economic costs, and sociocultural consequences) may be diminished.
