In order to supply a basis to identify possible prevention and control strategies, this review intends to demonstrate the fate of foodborne viruses in the farm to fork chain of fresh produce, which include the introduction routes (contamination sources), the viral survival abilities at different stages, and the reactions of foodborne viruses towards the treatments used in food processing of fresh produce. In general, the preharvest contamination comes mainly from soli fertilizer or irrigation water, while the harvest and postharvest contaminations come mainly from food handlers, which can be both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Foodborne viruses show high stabilities in all the stages of fresh produce production and processing. Low-temperature storage and other currently used preservation techniques, as well as washing by water have shown limited added value for reducing the virus load on fresh produce. Chemical sanitizers, although with limitations, are strongly recommended to be applied in the wash water in order to minimize cross-contamination. Alternatively, radiation strategies have shown promising inactivating effects on foodborne viruses. For high-pressure processing and thermal treatment, efforts have to be made on setting up treatment parameters to induce sufficient viral inactivation within a food matrix and to protect the sensory and nutritional qualities of fresh produce to the largest extent.",

Lettuce was believed to be contaminated with multiple nonzoonotic pathogens leading to the speculation that human fecal matter may have been the source of contamination, possibly via contaminated water Ethelberg and others (2010) Mixed raw vegetables Enteric viruses such as NoVs and HAV follow the fecal-oral transmission route. As both human NoV and HAV are currently believed to be nonzoonotic viral pathogens, the primary cause of contamination is contact with (residue of) infected and shedding people. A person infected with NoV can shed up to 10 12 viruses (RT-PCR) per gram of feces (Atmar and others 2008) . A person infected with HAV can excrete 10 6 to 10 8 particles/g of feces during infection (Sanchez 2013 ). Next to the high viral load during shedding and the low infectious dose, also environmental persistence facilitates water-and foodborne spread of NoV and HAV. Hence in this section, next to the causes of the contamination of fresh produce, also environmental persistence will be included during each of the stages of the farm-to-fork production chain.",

Links to a major outbreak in the Czech Republic in 1979 (28880 ill persons) specifically linked to HAV-contaminated frozen strawberries due to irrigation with sewage can be found (Legge\u00c4M 1997) . Viral foodborne outbreaks due to possible contamination as a result of vegetable or fruit spraying with insecticides and fungicides mixed with contaminated water were not found in the literature. However, the relevance of these 2 transmission routes for viral pathogens has been proven during experimental field studies (Cheong and others 2009; Brassard and others 2012) and by the use of QMRA others 2005b, 2011) . Viral contamination of plants by means of irrigation water may occur in 2 ways, either by direct contact, like by spray or splash, or through internalization into the tissue via the root system of the plant. In studies in which plants are grown in viral-contaminated hydroponic solution, high contamination levels of enteric viruses in edible plant tissue have been demonstrated, such as contamination levels exceeding 4 log 10 GC/plant for HAV and MNV have been found in all portions of both green onion and spinach plants, including the edible portions (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013a) .",

Irrigation method is an important factor as choosing an optimal strategy can minimize the contact of irrigation water with the above-ground portion of the crop and, hence, lower the risk of viral contamination. In a field study by Stine and others (2005b) no viral contamination of lettuce was detected when grown using subsurface drip irrigation practices, while the use of furrow irrigation led to contaminated lettuce. Crops irrigated with sprinkler and furrow systems may have a higher chance of direct contact with viruses and are, hence, considered to be more hazardous for fresh produce crops such as lettuce . Concerning the influence of produce type, leafy vegetables such as lettuce, with high water retention capacity and in close contact with the ground, are identified to be especially vulnerable to viral contamination through irrigation (Hamilton and others 2006) .",

In general, mean inactivation rates of viruses in fresh water are less than 1 log 10 per day, indicating that viruses can persist in freshwater sources for prolonged periods (Rzezutka and Cook 2004) . Persistence of surrogate virus MNV-1 has also been observed in reconstituted pesticides (Verhaelen and others 2013b) . With time, the ratio of infectious particles to genomic copies (molecular detection) has been observed to decrease and, as such, this ratio is partly depending on the \"age\" of contamination (De Roda Husman and others 2009). The persistence of enteric viruses in water is known to be affected by temperature, virus association with solids, exposure to light (UV), and the presence of indigenous microbiota. These are all factors that are known to be substantially different from one geographical location to another (John and Rose 2005; Bosch and others 2006) .",

As such, a D-value of 4.8 d was observed for MNV-1 on semisavoy spinach during a persistence study in greenhouse biocontrol chambers (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013c) . While an inactivation rate (k d ) as low as 0.01, 0.12, and 0.11 per day (corresponding to a D-value of 100, 8, and 9 d) was observed for HAV on cantaloupe, lettuce, and bell peppers, respectively, during a persistence study in a controlled environment chamber mimicking relevant growing condition in the United States and Central America (Stine and others 2005a) . All in all, these limited studies suggest that enteric viruses persist longer than enteric bacteria and may persist from the time of contamination (such as by means of irrigation) to harvesting (Stine and others 2005a) . Persistence can depend on crop type and even crop variety (e.g., survival of MNV-1 and TV on semisavoy spinach versus smooth spinach mentioned by Stine and others 2005a; Carratala and others 2013; Hirneisen and Kniel 2013c) . Since the surface texture and structure of vegetables may play an important role in the attachment and persistence of viruses.

In short, mean transfer rates of infectious viruses ranging from 2% to 18% and 0.1% to 2.3% have been found for contact of contaminated finger paths (dry conditions) with lettuce ( Enteric viruses have the potential to persist on hands for the better part of a work shift, as in a study by Mbithi and others (1992) a biphasic reduction curve was observed, resulting in a mere 0.5 to 0.8 log 10 reduction 4 h after inoculations of HAV on human hands. This illustrates the potential risk when infected food handlers are employed in a food processing/handling environment. Once surfaces are contaminated, these surfaces can function as reservoir for further contamination events, and this for prolonged periods of time, as the relative persistence of enteric viruses in the environment is high. As such, the half-life of HAV on stainless steel under different conditions (T \u08d820\u00b0C and RH <80%) was at least 4 d (Sattar and others 2000) . Surrogate MNV-1 has been observed to remain infectious after 28 d on several surfaces (stainless steel, ceramic, rubber, wood, glass, plastic) at room temperature (Kim and others 2014) . Exceptionally, it has been found that copper could effectively inactivate MNV-1 by destroying the viral capsid massively (Warnes and others 2015) . On inanimate surfaces, the most important factors that affect virus stability are the type of virus and surface, relative humidity, moisture content, temperature, composition of the suspending medium, light exposure, and presence of antiviral chemicals or biological agents (Bosch and others 2006) .",

In the processing of lettuce toward fresh-cut leafy greens, the produce is cut, washed, and spindried before packaging with or without protective atmosphere. This washing process has the potential to reduce the microbial load of the incoming fresh produce but has also the potential to be a direct source of contamination and a vehicle for spreading localized bacterial and viral contamination (cross-contamination) when sanitizers are used inadequately or are lacking (Holvoet and others 2014). As such, in a recent outbreak in Korea the use of contaminated ground water during the processing of cabbage kimchi was identified as the source of viral contamination (Cho and others 2014) . Viral transfer from contaminated fresh produce to washing water (without sanitizers) has been documented for both lab-scale and industrial-scale washing units (Baert and others 2009; Casteel and others 2009; Holvoet and others 2014) . Persistence of enteric viruses in wash water has been shown to amply exceed common working hours (\u08d932 h, 10\u00b0C) (Baert and others 2009) endorsing the potential risk for cross-contamination.

Therefore, a \"no bare hands\" rule was included in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's model food code and has been already adopted by many states. Such legislation is not commonly found in other parts of the world. However, while gloves may provide an important barrier against food contamination, it has to be noted that they cannot be used as a stand-alone hygienic measure. The combination of hand washing with an extra intervention measure-hand gloving and hand gloving/disinfectant-is advised to prevent virus spread during food preparation (Stals and others 2015) . In addition, infected food handlers can also indirectly contaminate the food by contaminating the environment. Besides, cross-contamination with naturally contaminated fresh produce or other food commodities such as seafood is also a risk factor. For example, the cross-contamination of salad by seafood was identified as the probable cause of an outbreak of NoV illness in 1979 (Griffin and others 1982) .",

Ideal storage temperatures for berries and leafy greens are 3 to 5\u00b0C and 0 to 5\u00b0C, respectively (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel 2014a,b). Temperature has been identified as the major factor influencing virus persistence. However, in contrast to bacterial pathogens, maintaining the cold-chain cannot be considered as a mitigation strategy for viral pathogens on fresh produce, as persistence of enteric viruses is higher at low temperatures, and decay rates generally increase with increasing temperatures (RIVM 2013). In Table 2 , log 10 reduction data are presented for the persistence of enteric viruses or their surrogates on soft red fruits and leafy greens. Next to temperature, persistence has been found to depend on other factors: type of fresh produce (Croci and others 2002; Verhaelen and others 2012) , different environmental factors, such as relative humidity (RH), presence of feces, and aggregation (Konowalchuk and Speirs 1975) , and the virus type (Rzezutka and Cook 2004) . The presence of fecal material strongly enhances virus persistence (Escudero and others 2012) . The effect of RH is less unambiguous given that MNV and MS2 persisted better at low RH, while HAV persisted better at higher RH in a study by Kim and others (2012) . In a recent study it was suggested that absolute humidity (AH, a measure of the actual amount of water vapor in a particular sample of air) rather than RH (the ratio of the actual amount of water vapor present in a sample to that amount that would be needed to saturate that particular sample) is the critical factor for keeping NoV infectious. The data also suggested that when the atmosphere was not entirely saturated (as 100% RH), low AH values (below 0.007 kg water/kg air) are favorable to NoV persistence. This possibly explains the seasonality of NoV infections since low winter AH conditions (96.3% of the day with AH <0.007 kg water/kg air) in a temperate climates as in Paris, France provides favorable conditions for keeping human NoV infectious (de la Noue and others 2014).",

MAP is a food-packaging method in which the proportions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen in a sealed container are different from those in the normal (ambient) air to enhance the food's shelf life. Next to functions such as the control of the respiration and reduction of enzymatic browning reactions, MAP conditions have also been designed to reduce the growth of spoilage microorganisms and pathogens. However, in a study on the persistence of HAV in packaged lettuce, a modified atmosphere did not influence the persistence when incubated at 4\u00b0C. Even a slight improvement in virus persistence on lettuce was observed in the presence of high CO 2 levels (70% CO 2 , 43% persistence) at room temperature (RT) compared to when stored in bags with normal atmospheric conditions (6% persistence) (Bidawid and others 2001) . MAP is also applied on berries, however mainly on berries intended to ship fresh for long distances, and not applied in final consumer packages (EFSA BIO-HAZ Panel 2014a). Next to MAP packaging, the antiviral activity of active packaging material consisting of silver-infused polylactide (PLA) films has also been explored on virally contaminated vegetables. However, the efficiency of active packaging based on silver depends very much on the food type, on environmental factors, and on the pathogen. For instance, on paprika no antiviral activity of the packaging towards FCV was observed, while reductions >3.5 log 10 were observed for FCV on lettuce (Martinez-Abad and others 2013).",

In the 2 largest European raspberry producing countries Serbia and Poland, the majority of raspberries (>70% and >90%, respectively), is exported frozen (Djurkovic 2012) . Freezing, however, has no pronounced influence on the viral load of fresh produce as no reduction was noted of MNV-1 surrogate on frozen onions and spinach after 6 mo of storage (Baert and others 2008a) , and frozen storage for 3 mo had limited effects on HAV and RV persistence in berries and herbs (Butot and others 2008) . Cryostability of NoV (GII.4) to freezing and thawing was also observed in a recent study by Richards and others (2012) . In general, freezing is actually used as a method for long-term storage of fecal and lysate stocks of enteric viruses in research. Also, during outbreak investigations, according to the CDC updated NoV outbreak management and disease prevention guidelines, food samples strongly suspected as the source of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis should be stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0C before analysis for optimal preservation (Hall and others 2011) . In conclusion, enteric viruses such as NoV and HAV are expected to persist during the shelf-life (up to 24 mo and more) of frozen fruit and vegetable products and have been implicated in several foodborne outbreaks due to frozen berries (Table 1) .",

Chlorine solutions can be either applied by immersion of the food or by spraying. After application of a sanitizer, in spray or in the form of a bath, rinsing or a final wash of the fresh produce in potable water is compulsory to remove any residual chemical and/or by-products.

The effectiveness of chlorine in virus inactivation on produce can vary according to the virus under study (Butot and others 2008; Fraisse and others 2011) and according to the type of produce (Butot and others 2008) . In spite of the rather modest viral reductions on fresh produce obtained using chlorine, chlorine is much more effective for inactivation of viral pathogens in suspension (wash water) than for removal of these pathogens from fresh produce (Dawson and others 2005) . This reasoning also applies to bacteria. Hence, despite the general idea that sanitizers are used to reduce the microbial population on the produce, their main effect is maintaining the microbial quality of the water (Gil and others 2009). Hence, the use of wash water sanitizers is highly valuable to reduce cross-contamination from one contaminated crop/batch to the other crops/batches present in the washing bath.",

These by-products are formed by reaction of the chlorine disinfectant with organic matter in the wash bath. Despite the occurrence of the formation of THMs in the process wash water, no residue can be found in vegetable tissue after rinsing with tap water (Lopez-Galvez and others 2010; Gomez-Lopez and others 2013). When good practices are applied (hence control of COD, FC, and regular refreshing of washing water), chlorinebased sanitizers such as chlorine gas, sodium hypochlorite, and calcium hypochlorite can be safely used to wash fresh produce, in spite of the formation of THMs in the water. As such, suggestions that the industry should move away from this traditional disinfection agent are unreasonable (Gil and others 2009) .",

However, application of ClO 2 in the United States is restricted for use in washing whole fruits and vegetables and, hence, not permitted for disinfection of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables (Hirneisen and others 2010) . Other restrictions for the use of chlorine dioxide are that it must be generated on site due to its instability and that it can be explosive when concentrated. Concentrated solutions of sodium chlorite are on the market, for example, Carnebon 200 (Intl.

            "text": "In conclusion, good practices for the washing of fresh produce require the use of a sanitizer. Sanitizers (such as Chlorine or PAA), however, are generally more effective in viral reduction in suspension (wash water) than on surfaces such as on fresh produce (Dawson and others 2005) as only marginal reductions of the viral load are obtained on fresh produce (1 to 2 log 10 ). Even the introduction of multiple washing steps performed in series (Baert and others 2008b) , extended contact times (Xie and others 2008) , or the use of increasing concentration of disinfectants (Butot and others 2008) , will not necessarily lead to significantly higher reductions of the viral load of fresh produce. Similar to bacteria, viruses can be located in protective sites on the produce, such as the stomata or the cut edges, not accessible during washing procedures and most decontamination processes. As such, the use of sanitizers during the wash process is primarily to maintain the microbial quality of the wash water and hence to limit the possibility of cross-contamination. Nonetheless, reporting of the effectiveness of the sanitizer under study in reducing the viral load in the resulting wash water is not always included. However, the latter is important to judge the utility for any sanitizers as mitigation strategy for cross-contamination. Good practices are also required to limit internalization of pathogens by avoiding influx of potentially contaminated wash water into the produce. Therefore, a higher temperature of the washing solution than the temperature of the produce is demanded, as if the reverse is true, air bubbles inside the fresh produce will shrink upon contact with the cold water, resulting in a partial vacuum causing wash water to enter the tissue through pores, channels, or punctures (Holvoet 2014 ).",

            "text": "Both ionizing and nonionizing radiation have been tested as disinfection strategies for vegetables contaminated with viruses. The most widespread used form of nonionizing radiation for decontamination is the UV light (100 to 400 nm). UV disinfection primarily occurs due to the germicidal action of UV-B (280 to 315 nm) and UV-C light (200 to 280 nm) on microorganisms (US EPA 2006) . Most studies use low-pressure (LP) mercury lamps with a major wavelength output (85%) at 253.7 nm (monochromatic UV radiation) (Hijnen and others 2006; Eischeid and others 2011) . Inactivation by this ultraviolet range is based on the damage caused to the nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) of the cell or virus, for which the UV absorbance peaks near 260 nm. Among food-and waterborne pathogens, viruses are generally more resistant than protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and the bacterial pathogens (Hijnen and others 2006) . Adenoviruses are the most UV-resistant class of viruses presently known and are, therefore, used as a standard for viral inactivation requirements in, for example, water disinfection (Eischeid and others 2011). Concerning fresh produce, UV light (dose: 40 to 120 mW s/cm\u00b2) was shown to be effective in the reduction of HAV and FCV on lettuce and green onions, resulting in reduction of 4 to 5 log 10 for HAV and 2.5 to 4 log 10 for FCV. However, on strawberries significantly lower reductions were observed for both viruses (<2 log 10 ). In a study by Hirneisen and Kniel (2013b) , however, MNV-1 proved to be more resistant to UV light, as a dose of 240 mW s/cm\u00b2 resulted in a mere reduction of about 1.2 log 10 on green onions. As such, the food matrix and surface typography play an obvious role (Fino and Kniel 2008) . Also, a wide variation in viral sensitivity to UV has been recognized (Eischeid and others 2011), making it impossible to estimate the possible influence on human NoV.",

In this study the effectiveness of 10 to 30 pulses (300 \u03bcs each, fluence of 0.94 J/cm 2 /pulse) was tested on MS2 inoculated on black pepper, chopped mint, and garlic powder.

As such, in the latter 2 cases the producing equipment can be switched on or off depending on the need.

Although the resulting characteristics of the treated products are superior compared to heat-treated products, still HPP has been shown to affect sensory qualities such as color, texture, shape, and rheological properties. However, these variable effects on the sensor quality of fresh produce are depending on the pressure level and type of product (Kovac and others 2010; Lou and others 2011) . As such, HPP has been recommended for the processing of fruits intended for frozen storage, since freezing causes similar and more severe texture damage (Lou and others 2011; Li and others 2013b) . Fresh produce-related products such as purees, sauces, and juices are also fit for usage of HPP, as compared to intact fresh produce as they lack the presence of intercellular air spaces that can be severely compressed during pressure treatment, inducing physical damage to the tissue (Li and others 2013b).",

For example, colder initial temperatures of the product enhanced the inactivation of human NoV (GI.1) (Leon and others 2011) and surrogates MNV-1, TV, and FCV (Chen and others 2005; Li and others 2013b). In contrast, HAV, a picornavirus, is more resistant to HPP at a lower temperature than at room temperature (Kingsley and Chen 2009 ). The same for the parameter pH, where human NoV (surrogates) tend to be more sensitive to HPP at neutral pH than at acidic pH (Lou and others 2011; Li and others 2013a).

As such, it is conceivable that different human NoV genogroups, and perhaps different clusters within a human NoV genogroup, would exhibit varied sensitivities to HPP (Leon and others 2011) . During testing, human NoV surrogates FCV and TV proved to be more susceptible to HPP compared to MNV-1 (Horm and others 2012a; Li and others 2013b). In the study by Lou and others (2011) on the application of HPP in the fresh produce industry, the optimal condition for MNV-1 inactivation by HPP in diverse fresh produce matrices was determined to be refrigeration temperature with a treatment pressure of 450 MPa and a holding time of 2 min. Using these conditions viral reductions between 4.7 and 7.0 log 10 were obtained without significantly altering the physical quality of the food samples (Lou and others 2011) . However, when the inactivation kinetics of MNV-1 (cell-culture) are compared to human NoV GI.1 (obtained during a human feeding study using infected high-pressure processed oysters), human NoV might be more resistant to HPP than MNV-1. As in the human feeding study by Leon and others (2011) treatment of oyster (seeded by injection) by HPP at 400 MPa, for 5 min at 6\u00b0C was insufficient to prevent NoV infection in human volunteers, suggesting that 4 log 10 genome equivalent reduction was not achieved. While a 5 min, 400 MPa treatment at 5\u00b0C was sufficient to inactivate 4.1 log 10 PFU MNV-1 in oyster tissue (Kingsley and others 2007) . In the human volunteer study a 600 MPa treatment for 5 min at 6\u00b0C was successful to inactivate human NoV GI.1 within raw oysters (Leon and others 2011) . This higher resistance of human NoV to HPP was also observed when binding assays, using porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic beads followed by RT-qPCR assays, were used for discriminating potentially infectious human NoVs GI.1 (Dancho and others 2012) and GII.4 (Li and others 2013a) following HPP.",

In light of the main identified food commodities of concern, namely soft red fruits and leafy greens, this section will be restricted to the effect of classic heat treatment (pasteurization) and blanching, since heating of frozen berries has been regularly communicated as a mitigation strategy for foodborne outbreaks due to viral-contaminated berries (Guzman-Herrador and others 2014). The possible effectiveness of this measure was illustrated during the German outbreak in 2012 due to contaminated frozen strawberries. During the outbreak investigation it was noted that not all kitchens which used the implicated batch of frozen strawberries were linked to disease cases. This was a result of the different ways of preparing the strawberry compote among kitchens. As such, it was observed that those places receiving meals from kitchens where the strawberry compote was stewed (thoroughly cooked) were not affected by outbreaks. The schools and childcare facilities that received the compote from kitchens that did not sufficiently heat the compote were indeed obviously associated with disease cases (Task Force gastroenteritis 2012).",

Hence, validation of a specific heat treatment in the relevant food matrix is well-considered. However, in the literature only a limited number of heat inactivation studies are available for produce matrices. Relevant matrices used for traditional heat inactivation experiments of enteric viruses/surrogates are restricted to purees of soft red fruits (raspberry, strawberry, bilberry) others 2004, 2010; Baert and others 2008a) and spinach (Bozkurt and others 2014a) .",

The inadequacy of mild heat treatment steps at low temperatures can also be confirmed by a human challenge study in which human NoV was found to remain infectious for volunteers after 30 min at 60\u00b0C (Dolin and others 1972) . Next to the virus type, matrix factors such as pH and sugar content have been confirmed to have a significant effect on heat inactivation of enteric viruses and surrogates. As such, studies are available that observed a rise in inactivation time of HAV (in strawberry mashes) and MNV-1 (in PBS), with increasing sucrose concentration and observed a moderate rise in inactivation time of HAV (in strawberry mashes) with increasing pH. Attempts have been made to model the heat inactivation of HAV in berry mashes as a function of temperature and product characteristics, such as pH and sugar concentration (Deboosere and others 2004; Deboosere and others 2010) . However, validation of the model by Deboosere and others (2004) in fruit-based products failed. Weaknesses of the latter model of Deboosere and others (2010) are the limited temperature range (65 to 75\u00b0C) and the inclusion of the come-up time (about 2 min) in the treatment time. This practice assumes that the temperature during this come-up time was constant and at the target temperature, and possibly explains the occurrence of a shoulder in the inactivation curves and the very low log reduction estimates when the model was used to calculate the effect of short heat treatments (0.02 and 0.16 log 10 reduction at 30 s and 1 min at 75\u00b0C and pH 2.5, respectively). In contrast, in-house data on MNV-1 heat inactivation in raspberry puree (75\u00b0C, 30 s) suggest a reduction of \u08d94.29 log 10 (unpublished data). As such, there is a need for additional studies that take into account heat-inactivation kinetics during the phase of temperature increase to reach the target temperature (Deboosere and others 2010) or models that do not include the preheating step at all. As in validation of time/temperature treatments in food processing, generally preheating and longer exposure to these temperatures during cooling down are not included to assume a worst case scenario in which the reduction solely originates from the actual heat treatment (Baert and others 2008a) .",

Blanching is a heat pretreatment (between 75 and 105\u00b0C) that is generally conducted prior to freezing and canning to inactivate microorganisms and enzymes and to remove entrapped air. Both the hot water bath blanching process and steam blanching have been proven to be effective. As such, a reduction of \u08d92.44 log MNV-1 (detection limit of assay was reached) was observed when fresh spinach was treated for 1 min in a hot water bath of either 80\u00b0C or 90\u00b0C (Baert and others 2008b) . Confirmation of the effectiveness of (steam) blanching was provided in a study on fresh herbs such as parsley, basil, mint, and chives. Generally >3 log 10 reductions were observed for HAV and FCV on fresh herbs when blanched at 95\u00b0C for 2.5 min. When blanching was performed at 75\u00b0C for 2.5 min, more variation in heat resistance of enteric viruses was observed, varying depending on the herb (e.g., HAV reduction on mint and chives was 1.7 and >3.0 log 10 , respectively) (Butot and others 2009).",

However, cooking procedures in which an internal temperature of the food reaches at least 90\u00b0C for 90 s are considered adequate treatments to destroy viral infectivity in most foods (FAO/WHO 2012). Following the recommendation for heat treatment of shellfish (90\u00b0C for 90 s), HAV was successfully inactivated in shellfish (Hewitt and Greening 2006) . Several other thermal studies suggest that high-temperature, short-time treatments (90\u00b0C, 30 s) should suffice for inactivation (>4 log 10 reduction) of human NoV (surrogates) (Bozkurt and others 2014b; in-house data on MNV-1 reduction in raspberry puree: \u08d94 log 10 for 95\u00b0C, 30 s). Nevertheless, data concerning heat treatments of produce at temperatures >75\u00b0C are scarce and only available for a limited number of surrogates (Deboosere and others 2004 for HAV). Hence additional relevant heat inactivation Foodborne viruses in fresh produce . . . studies for this high-temperature range in relevant produce matrices and for several (surrogate) viruses should be conducted to obtain more insight.",

The high persistence of NoV in the environment combined with high resistance of NoV to commonly used decontamination practices (washing) of fresh produce, ensures the persistence of NoV between contamination and consumption due to the relative short shelf-life of fresh produce. As such, effective control strategies need to focus on prevention of contamination and to limit cross-contamination. The most important routes identified in this review are contaminated food handlers, justifying the need for creating awareness on the issue of NoV and HAV and education of food handlers in good hygienic practices. In addition, contaminated irrigation water and process water have been shown to be relevant viral contamination routes of fresh produce. This introduces the need for assessment of the risk associated with the irrigation water source used, the implementation of proper water treatment options, and, in the case of washing of fresh produce, the inclusion of good practices, including the correct use of sanitizers in the wash process.",
