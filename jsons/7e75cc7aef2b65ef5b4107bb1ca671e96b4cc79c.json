IFN-\u03b1, relatively ineffective in cell culture, showed suggestive but inconclusive efficacy in monkeys and SARS patients. 1,2 IFN-\u03b2 has most potent antiviral activity, though concentrations of greater than 1000 U/ml result in only marginal reduction of virus titer. 3-7 IFN-\u03b3 is ineffective against SARS-CoV in cell culture. 3, 5, 6 To characterize the inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 treatment on SARS-CoV replication, three-day viral growth assays were performed. IFN pretreated Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.01. Cultures treated with 100 U/ml of IFNor IFN-\u03b3 were significantly refractory for SARS-CoV Urbani and HK replication (P < 0.001) at 24 and 48 hpi (Figures 1a and 1b) . By 72 hpi, however, viral titers in IFN-\u03b2-or IFN-\u03b3-treated cultures approached levels detected in vehicle-treated groups. A potent inhibitory effect was observed when Vero E6 cultures were treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3. The inhibitory effect achieved with combination IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 treatment was consistently greater than 3000-fold at all time points tested and reached levels of greater than 1\u00d710 5 -fold at 72 hpi relative to vehicle treated Vero E6 cells.",

Relative to vehicle-treated and individual IFN-treated cultures, CPE is less evident in cells treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 at 120 hpi; monolayers appeared evenly stained with little to no visible CPE ( Fig. 2D and 2H ). To determine whether this phenomenon is limited to Vero E6 cells, additional cell lines were examined. Calu-3 cells showed the same gradated CPE as Vero E6 cells with little or no CPE present in cells treated with both IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3) . Contrary to the observations of others, gross CPE does not occur in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells in our hands. 3, 13 As such, SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cell monolayers remained confluent regardless of treatment. However, the CPE profile observed in Calu-3 cells suggests that the synergistic inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication by IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 is not Vero E6 cell specific.",

However, it was recently shown that NO, induced by a combination of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1 , inhibits SARS-CoV replication. 15 Further, it was shown in an avian system that type I and type II IFN potentiate the antiviral response as well as the secretion of NO. 16 Based on this evidence, a role for NO and iNOS in the potentiated anti-SARS-CoV response induced by type I and type II IFN cotreatment deserves consideration.",
