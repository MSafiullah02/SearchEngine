Despite the importance of studying microbial communities in the environment and within hosts, classical methods of microbe discovery are not easily applied at the community level. For example, characterization by isolation and culturing is unsuitable for members of the microbial community that is difficult to grow in culture (Fancello, Raoult, & Desnues, 2012). Serological tests of antibody presence are targeted towards specific taxa and can be difficult to interpret due to antibody cross\u2010reactivity and inconsistent cut\u2010off thresholds for positivity (Gilbert et al., 2013). Molecular detection of nucleic acids by targeted PCR remains an important technique for sequencing specific genomic regions, but these approaches cannot identify all taxa present and are inappropriate for discovering new, highly divergent taxa as designing primers or probes requires prior knowledge of nucleotide sequences (Fancello et al., 2012; Temmam, Davoust, Berenger, Raoult, & Desnues, 2014). In contrast, unbiased deep sequencing has the potential to capture a snapshot of microbial communities in a large number of samples without prior expectations about what taxa will be detected.",

            "text": "Deep sequencing has illuminated the structure and function of microbial communities across time and space in ways that would not have been possible using traditional methods. In the field of ecology, theories developed at macro\u2010organismal level have been tested in microbial communities, such as the cycling of predator and prey populations (Rodriguez\u2010Brito et al., 2010) and the existence of elevational diversity gradients (Fierer et al., 2011). Deep sequencing has also demonstrated that both bacterial and viral communities differ across abiotic environments (Dinsdale et al., 2008) in such diverse systems as soil bacteria (Fierer et al., 2012) and marine viruses (Hurwitz, Westveld, Brum, & Sullivan, 2014). In the context of human and animal health, deep sequencing can identify candidate pathogens in unexplained disease (Briese et al., 2009; Cox\u2010Foster et al., 2007; Honkavuori et al., 2008; Palacios et al., 2008) and potential hosts and vectors of emerging pathogens (Masembe et al., 2012; Veikkolainen, Vesterinen, Lilley, & Pulliainen, 2014; Volokhov et al., 2017). Studies of host\u2010associated microbial communities have revealed that microbes vary across body habitats, space and time (Blekhman et al., 2015; Costello et al., 2009), and that a community\u2010level perspective of host\u2010associated microbes is critical for understanding health and disease (Lecuit & Eloit, 2013; Vayssier\u2010Taussat et al., 2014; Virgin, 2014). Sequencing host\u2010associated bacterial communities in wildlife has revealed that communities vary over time (Bobbie, Mykytczuk, & Schulte\u2010Hostedde, 2017), that social interactions are key determinants of community composition (Grieneisen, Livermore, Alberts, Tung, & Archie, 2017; Tung, Barreiro, Burns, & Grenier, 2015) and that dietary changes due to habitat degradation can alter bacterial communities (Amato et al., 2013). While host\u2010associated viral communities in wildlife remain relatively unexplored, the divergent responses of host\u2010associated bacteria and viruses to experimental diet modification (Howe et al., 2015) and the biological differences between the two types of microbes suggest that viral communities in wildlife might exhibit different patterns to those observed in bacteria.",

            "text": "Deep sequencing studies of microbial communities typically employ either metagenomics, which is the random sequencing of genomic fragments of an entire sample, or metabarcoding, which is a sequence\u2010specific PCR\u2010based approach (Creer et al., 2016). Studies of bacterial communities frequently use 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) metabarcoding to examine highly multiplexed samples. However, viral communities lack a similarly conserved marker across or even within viral families (Mokili, Rohwer, & Dutilh, 2012; Rohwer & Edwards, 2002) and are therefore more commonly characterized using metagenomics. Although this approach is currently less cost\u2010 and time\u2010efficient than metabarcoding for large numbers of samples, it can assign taxa at higher resolution (depending on factors such as read length, genomic region and reference database) and avoids PCR biases (Jovel et al., 2016). Shotgun metagenomics also allows the simultaneous characterization of different microbial communities (e.g., bacterial and viral) (Chandler, Liu, & Bennett, 2015; Schneeberger et al., 2016) as well as host population structure and diet (Srivathsan, Ang, Vogler, & Meier, 2016). Furthermore, metagenomics can detect viruses at or below the sensitivity of taxon\u2010specific PCR and qPCR (Greninger et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2011), implying that broader taxonomic coverage does not necessarily trade off with sensitivity. Targeted approaches also likely underestimate or bias measures of viral diversity, potentially impacting downstream comparative analyses. The ability of metagenomics to sensitively detect taxa that are not specifically targeted and/or were previously undescribed has the potential to overturn prior understandings of viral community diversity and distribution based on serology and PCR.",

Viral communities include single\u2010 and double\u2010stranded viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes, ranging in size from 1,259,197 bp (Megavirus chilensis; Arslan, Legendre, Seltzer, Abergel, & Claverie, 2011) to 1,700 bp (Hepatitis delta virus; Taylor, 2006); larger viral genomes that have a higher probability of being sequenced may be over\u2010represented in the inferred community (Fancello et al., 2012). The RNA virus component of viral communities is highly sensitive to degradation due to temperature and storage conditions, raising questions about how samples should be preserved and transported. Indeed, different storage media alter viral detection in PCR\u2010based studies (Forster, Harkin, Graham, & McCullough, 2008; Osborne et al., 2011) and it is reasonable to assume the same in metagenomic studies.",

            "text": "Two popular methods for preserving viruses from field or clinical samples are viral transport media (VTM), an aqueous solution that typically contains protective proteins, antibiotics, and buffers to control the pH (Johnson, 1990) and RNAlater, a commercial reagent that penetrates tissues and stabilizes RNA (Ambion). VTM has historically been used to preserve samples when viruses are to be detected by PCR or cultured in vitro (e.g., Jensen & Johnson, 1994; Druce, Garcia, Tran, Papadakis, & Birch, 2012). Given the large number of historically collected samples in VTM, it would be ideal to include these in metagenomic studies. However, VTM may not be an appropriate medium because one commonly used component, foetal bovine serum (FBS), may be contaminated with bovine viruses. RNAlater is another popular medium for storing microbial samples collected in the field (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2017; Drexler et al., 2011; Frick et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2015), as it preserves RNA without requiring immediate freezing. However, its high salt content, while not problematic for solid tissue samples, creates challenges for nucleic acid extraction from the kinds of noninvasive swab samples that are typical of ecological field studies (e.g., blood, urine, faeces and saliva). While viruses are often extracted from an aliquot of supernatant (Baker et al., 2013; Tse et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012), extraction from the swab itself may be desirable for samples stored in RNAlater (Vo & Jedlicka, 2014). These extraction procedures need to be tested and optimized for more widespread use in noninvasive viral metagenomics.",

            "text": "Another challenge for viral metagenomics is that since genomes are sequenced at random, larger host and bacterial genomes are preferentially detected relative to smaller viral genomes (Nakamura et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2011). For this reason, samples are often enriched for viruses using methods including nuclease treatment, filtration of host/bacterial particles, density gradient centrifugation and removal of rRNA (Hall et al., 2014; Kleiner, Hooper, & Duerkop, 2015; Kohl et al., 2015). DNase treatment is a well\u2010established and effective method of enrichment (Allander, Emerson, Engle, Purcell, & Bukh, 2001), while filtration and centrifugation are sometimes used but can bias the inferred viral community composition (Kleiner et al., 2015; Thurber, Haynes, Breitbart, Wegley, & Rohwer, 2009) and are impractical for ecological studies given the large numbers of samples typically processed and interest in generating community data rather than focusing on a particular pathogen. Depletion of host rRNA is unlikely to bias the viral community (He et al., 2010; Matranga et al., 2014), but may affect the distribution of coverage across the viral genome (Li et al., 2016). Identifying a combination of laboratory methods that maximize the proportion of viral reads while minimizing bias would allow greater multiplexing, enabling metagenomic studies of viral communities on an ecological or evolutionary scale.",

To optimize our protocol for comparative viral metagenomics, we first address the following questions: (a) Are samples stored in VTM containing FBS appropriate for viral metagenomics? (b) what is the most effective way to extract viral nucleic acid from swabs stored in RNAlater? and do the enrichment methods of (c) rRNA depletion and (d) DNase treatment increase the number of viral reads or viral taxa detected?

Bats were captured within roosts using hand nets or while they exited roosts using mist nets and harp traps. For nocturnal captures, nets were open from approximately 18:00\u20136:00 and checked every 30 min; a combination of one to three mist nets and one harp trap was used depending on the size and number of roost exits identified. When exact roost locations were unknown, bats were captured while foraging at livestock pens using mist nets.

Importantly, our results are unlikely to indicate the presence of live viruses in FBS since commercial FBS is often heat\u2010inactivated and screened for live viruses. Instead, our detections probably represent viral nucleic acids which persist after heat inactivation, but which could nevertheless impact metagenomic studies. Detecting BVDV is unsurprising, as it is a common cell culture contaminant that has previously been found in high quantities in FBS (Allander et al., 2001; Gagnieur et al., 2014). Consistent with the South American origin of the FBS used in our analyses, BVDV\u20103, or HoBi\u2010like viruses, was initially reported in FBS from South America and is likely endemic to livestock in Brazil (Bauermann & Ridpath, 2015). The consistent presence and proportion of BVDV as well as Retroviridae and several bacteriophage families (Table 2) across FBS batches suggest that this source of contamination could perhaps be accounted for in order to include VTM samples containing FBS in metagenomics studies. However, reads in FBS also matched the family Adenoviridae (genus Mastadenovirus), which are also common in bats (Drexler et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010), including neotropical species (Wray et al., 2016). If bat samples stored in VTM were sequenced and filtered for viral genera detected in FBS, this would potentially exclude true bat viruses. Our results therefore suggest that metagenomic results from historical samples stored in media containing FBS should be interpreted with caution and avoided where possible.",

This could be due to the high salt concentrations in RNAlater that are designed to inhibit RNase activity, but which could also interfere with extraction from the supernatant/pellet. Typically, tissues stored in RNAlater are blotted to remove excess solution, and other samples such as blood are centrifuged, and the supernatant is removed prior to extraction. Unfortunately, it is not possible to completely remove the RNAlater from swabs but extracting from the swab itself might minimize salts relative to the other components of the sample. It is also possible that virus particles mostly remain within the swab itself when stored in RNAlater.",

We tested only one virus in this experiment, which may limit our ability to extrapolate the estimated limit of detection or extraction efficiency to other viruses with different characteristics or to field\u2010collected samples that include host cells and other material.

The rRNA depletion results suggested that removing host rRNA increased both the number of viral reads and number of viral taxa detected without biasing the viral community, as has been observed in previous studies (He et al., 2010; Matranga et al., 2014). The only case in which there were more reads in the non\u2010enriched samples was the family Retroviridae; however, retroviruses integrate into the host genome and are likely to behave differently than other viral taxa with respect to enrichment. Although the Ribo\u2010Zero kit is described as being for human/mouse/rat and should be tested before use on other sample types, it has been used effectively on samples from taxa as distantly related as mosquitos (Weedall, Irving, Hughes, & Wondji, 2015), and we also found it to be effective for enriching samples taken from bats.",

DNase is a well\u2010established method to reduce the number of host and bacterial reads relative to virus (Allander et al., 2001). Our light treatment was intended to knock down rather than remove all DNA, also potentially allowing for better detection of bacteria and parasites compared with an intensive enrichment, although we did not test this explicitly. Although this step could have caused bias towards RNA viruses, DNA virus reads occurred in all samples, as has been found in other viral metagenomic studies using an RNA\u2010based approach (Hall et al., 2014; Kohl et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016), including those with a DNase treatment step (Baker et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2014). This could be explained by the presence of viral RNA transcripts, DNA viruses that replicate through an RNA intermediate (e.g., Hepadnaviridae), the ability of some DNA virus families to integrate into the genome of their host (e.g., Herpesviridae) or DNA being carried through the DNase treatment into library prep due to the light treatment or less than perfect efficiency of the reaction.",

In addition, it would be impossible to include a filtration step since swabs were immediately treated with lysis buffer in the extraction, leading to lysis of the viral particles which would normally be selected for using filtration. In the light of the above results, and despite the relatively small number of samples, we recommend rRNA depletion and light DNase treatment as an effective combination for viral enrichment.",

            "text": "It is worth noting the caveats of analysing noninvasively collected samples. First, although contamination has not been well characterized in viral metagenomic studies, it is a known problem in bacterial community studies. Samples with low microbial biomass are particularly sensitive to contamination with other microbes, for example from DNA extraction kits (Salter et al., 2014) or ultrapure water (Laurence, Hatzis, & Brash, 2014). Our protocol minimized this risk by pooling samples following extraction to increase the amount of target nucleic acid relative to potential reagent\u2010derived contaminants in downstream steps. Second, noninvasive samples will only detect viruses that are actively shed in urine and faeces, thus may miss latent viruses that are sporadically shed, but might be detectable by sequencing organs from sacrificed animals (Amman et al., 2012). Third, our protocol is not able to discriminate between viruses actively infecting hosts and transient viruses acquired from diet or the environment. Although some sources of bias are unavoidable, and it is likely that not all viral taxa in a given sample will be identified, the same is true of all studies in community ecology where exhaustive sampling is not possible (Gotelli & Colwell, 2001; Hughes, Hellmann, Ricketts, & Bohannan, 2001), and we showed statistically that viral communities in our samples were adequately sampled (Figure 6). Our approach yielded sufficient depth to confidently characterize viral communities at the viral family or genus level, while identification of species or strains might be achieved by further increasing read depths to generate longer contigs that could be more precisely assigned (Figure 5).",

A standardized approach to viral metagenomics opens many potential avenues of research in disease and community ecology. For example, viral community data collected across multiple individuals, populations and species allow the investigation of ecological processes shaping host\u2010associated viral community structure (Anthony et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017). Taxonomic and functional patterns of bacterial diversity across host species are influenced by diet and phylogeny (Ley et al., 2008; Muegge et al., 2011; Zepeda Mendoza et al., 2018), but drivers of host\u2010associated viral communities may be different. In humans, host\u2010associated viral communities are stable over time within individuals, but highly variable between individuals (Minot et al., 2011; Reyes et al., 2010). These observations suggest the potential to use viral communities as a host or environmental \u201cfingerprint\u201d to evaluate interactions between multiple hosts, or between hosts and environments, as has been proposed in humans and primates (Fierer et al., 2010; Franzosa et al., 2015; Stumpf et al., 2016). Finally, although it was not the focus of our study, we also detected reads from vertebrates, protozoa and bacteria (Supporting Information Figure S3), suggesting that with appropriate bioinformatic modifications, shotgun metagenomic data generated using our protocol could simultaneously shed light on host genetics, diet, other non\u2010viral pathogens and commensal microbes. As metagenomics becomes an ever more popular and powerful tool for viral ecology, use of standardized methods such as those developed here will be crucial for comparative insights from diverse host species and environments.",
