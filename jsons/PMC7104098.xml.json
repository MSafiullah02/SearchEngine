A hotel's physical infrastructure (buildings, water, power, sanitation) may be at risk from a variety of natural and man-made hazards placing staff and guests at risk.

The hotel's surrounding environment (sea, forests, natural beauty) can be affected by hazards making their locale less desirable for future tourist in the short term [5]. Hotel vulnerabilities are complex and factors that contribute to risk are often the tourist motivation to visit.",

In the aftermath of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, the hotel industry in Phuket, Thailand successfully reopened 80% of their hotels within a week, only to see occupancy rates drop to 10% [29]. Decrease in tourism can also be due to facility availability and access. In 2005, following Hurricane Katrina and the New Orleans levees failure, the lodging industry in New Orleans, which included an estimated 38,000 rooms, was almost completely shut down [91]. Following a second major earthquake in five months (February 2011) Christchurch, New Zealand lost two-thirds of their hotel inventory [64]. Aggravating the influence of disasters on tourism further is the increasing interdependence of the tourist industry, where a negative event in one location can affect the tourist economy of many countries [43]. For example, the 2010 Icelandic Volcanic Ash Cloud caused disruption to air travel throughout Europe [66]. \u201cTourism destinations in every corner of the globe face the virtual certainty of experiencing a disaster of one form or another at some point in their history\u201d ([24], p. 135).",

Rockett [84] writes that definitions may be transient over time, but can serve our current need and allow for common understanding. The most prevalent definitions adopted by authors of tourism sector research has been Faulkner's [24] concept that crises often have a component that could have been controlled by the group being affected (e.g. management failing to react to events in a way that minimizes effects), while disasters occur suddenly and the actual trigger event is out of the control of those affected (e.g. an earthquake hitting a populated area). Ritchie [80] recognises that an overlap can occur, when leadership actions during a disaster then develop into a related crisis, thus confusing the concepts. Some authors chose not to tackle the distinction of disaster and crisis but instead use the terms alternately or simultaneously [80].",

In this spectrum one reduces (or eliminates) possible risks, readies for risk that cannot be reduced or eliminated, responds to events with the readied preparation, and works toward recovery after the event, including reducing or eliminating possible threats. Faulkner [24] provides six phases of disaster in a tourism disaster management framework. These phases include: 1) pre-event, where action is taken to reduce effects of, or eliminate, potential events; 2) prodromal, the time immediate prior to an imminent disaster where warnings and plans are initiated; 3) emergency, the actual disaster response activities; 4) intermediate, where short term issues are resolved and return to normal is being planned; 5) long-term recovery, a continuation of previous phase; and 6) resolution, the final phase where normal activities resume and review of events takes place. In both of these disaster management cycles the concept remains that the management process begins prior to the onset of an event with planning and risk reduction, continuing through to learning lessons and applying those lessons to future planning.",

When organisations are too rigid and systematic, with too many layers of bureaucracy, they are less able to create adaptation strategies during dynamic events [12], [8]. Sawalha [88] studied resilience of insurance companies in Jordan. Findings included that the Jordanian business model characterised by centralized power and hierarchy, with low levels of autonomy and delegation worked at cross-purpose with resiliency.

When building resilience to disasters short-term, non-sustainable adaptions are often critical for survival and a part of the process.

Disaster resiliency for hotels may translate into lives saved, as well as business reputation. However, the idea that disaster preparedness plans, disaster risk reduction activities, and disaster resilience building are separate activities from commercial concerns is reflected in the literature. An example of this disconnect may include managing a profitable hotel business; yet, managers do not prioritize planning for continued operations following a disaster. Competition for support and funds can be difficult as preparedness planning and resilience building are hard to quantify in regards to return on time and investment [40], [52]. Furthermore, tourism operators may not be making headway due to the already voluminous workload, leaving little time to pursue new planning avenues [63].",

Business continuity planning is focused on establishing a strategic plan to re-establish key business operations to ensure business survival [57]. Business continuity planning may include such things as audits of facilities, identifying key persons, developing prevention strategies, and acquiring insurance to cover potential losses [57]. In addition, preparedness planning for organisations must include how to operate in unusual conditions, such as lack of water or power. Resilient enterprises analyse disruptions to find positive actions that will carry the business forward.",
