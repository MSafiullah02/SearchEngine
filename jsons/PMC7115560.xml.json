Taiwan has traditionally been an export-oriented country, not a popular international tourist destination. However, understanding that the proceeds from tourism expansion can represent a significant income source for the national economy (Kim et al., 2006), the Taiwanese government has begun developing its international tourism market. Moreover, Chen (2011) showed that the development of the Taiwanese THI relies on the growth of the tourism market, proxied by the growth of total foreign tourist arrivals. Specifically, the tourism market expansion could explain 53% of occupancy rate, 92% of revenue per available room, 45% of return on asset and 48% of return on equity of tourist hotels in Taiwan.",

In that year, the TBT introduced the \u201cDoubling Tourist Arrivals Plan\u201d (DTAP), designed to strengthen the national economy by attracting 5 million international visitors to Taiwan by 2008. Although the DTAP was a casualty of poor global economic performance and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the TBT introduced several more tourism promotion plans to promote international tourism and attract more foreign tourists. In 2005, the Tourism Flagship Plan was launched to promote the nation's top attractions and cultural festivals. The Tour Taiwan Years 2008\u20132009 Plan introduced at the end of 2007 was intended to attract 4.25 million foreign visitors to Taiwan by 2009.",

The Taiwanese president Ma Ying-Jeou has endorsed stronger economic ties with China since taking office in May 2008 (TBT, 2008). One of his policies was to re-open direct flights between Taiwan and China, which had been banned since 1949. Taiwan and China signed the agreement to restore regular direct flights between the two regions on June 13, 2008 and direct flights resumed on July 4, 2008. Since then, up to 3000 Chinese tourists a day are allowed to visit Taiwan and the number increased from 3000 to 7200 after May 2009. In 2011, Chinese tourists were allowed to visit Taiwan without having to join tour groups. According to the Annual Statistics of Tourism 2010 (TBT, 2011), the total number of foreign visitors to Taiwan has increased from 1.022 million in 2001 to 3.246 million in 2010, approximately a 218% growth rate over the 10-year period. This phenomenal growth of the tourism market growth is expected to create a significant demand for hotels, thereby improving the corporate performance of the Taiwanese tourist hotel companies.",

Specifically, the influences of \u0394IP and \u0394TA are positive and the effect of DSARS is negative, both of which are consistent with results in Chen (2007, 2010). The adjusted R-squares suggest that among three significant factors, \u0394TA explains the highest percentage of the variation in Pr(bull). Specifically, \u0394TA, \u0394IP and DSARS can explain approximately 20%, 9% and 13% of the variation in Pr(bull), respectively.",

In other words, the mean growth rate of HGS is more than 20 times of the size of LGS. These results imply that the industry has somehow avoided entering a recession for the past 12 years because even the mean growth rate of LGS was positive. Moreover, the standard deviation (risk) in two regimes is 0.008% and 0.038%, meaning that HGS is more stable than LGS.",

The findings indicate that the industry has a high tendency to stay in HGS and a low tendency to shift from HGS to LGS. Third, the expected duration of HGS is about 16 months, and that of LGS is about three months. This shows that the Taiwanese THI cycle is asymmetric and especially the expected duration of HGS of THI is about five times longer than that of LGS.",
