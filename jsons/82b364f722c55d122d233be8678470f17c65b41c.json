The findings were generally consistent with an axonal variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in three patients and with a demyelinating process in two patients. 1 Magnetic resonance imaging, performed with the administration of gadolinium, showed enhancement of the caudal nerve roots in two patients, enhancement of the facial nerve in one patient, and no signal changes in nerves in two patients. Additional laboratory findings are shown in Table S2 .",

There have been reports of an association between Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and coronavirus infections. 3, 4 On the basis of this observational series involving five patients, it is not possible to determine whether severe deficits and axonal involvement are typical features of Covid-19-associated Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. We could not determine the effect of reduced vital capacity due to neuromuscular failure from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in these patients, but such an effect might be considered if findings on chest imag- ing are not commensurate with the severity of respiratory insufficiency. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome with Covid-19 should be distinguished from critical illness neuropathy and myopathy, which tend to appear later in the course of critical illness than Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.
