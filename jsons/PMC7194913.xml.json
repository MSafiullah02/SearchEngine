Wang et al.2 reported 124 patients (89.9%) in China who received antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, and 36 of these patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 6 died (4.3%). Holshue et al.3 presented the first case to receive intravenous remdesivir in the United States, and the outcome was satisfactory. Lopinavir and ritonavir were associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with SARS in a non-randomized open-label trial.4 Here, we report five confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan; two were prescribed LPV/r as two tablets twice daily for empirical therapy, and three were not prescribed LPV/r. We describe their diagnosis, clinical course, and novel coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) viral loads during the treatment course.",

In contrast, therapeutic lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-beta-1b preserved pulmonary function but did reduce viral replication in vivo.\n11 The first reported case in the USA showed a prompt reduction in fever and much-improved clinical symptoms after administration of remdesivir on day 12 of illness after administration of remdesvir starting on day 10 of illness.3 Thereafter, the effectiveness of remdesivir garnered much attention worldwide. However, chest roentgenography of the aforementioned US case showed only relatively mild infiltrations, and the rRT-PCR assay of a oropharyngeal swab was negative on illness day 12, soon after remdesivir was first administered. Thus, the suppression of SARS CoV-2 activity by remdesivir needs to be further investigated, and as of now, there have been only a few clinical experiences.",

            "text": "Lopinavir is an antiretroviral agent, boosted by ritonavir, that is widely used for treating HIV. Experiences using LPV/r to treat SARS-CoV have been reported in several studies. Cao and co-workers showed 199 adult patients with severe COVID-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir treatment beyond standard care, and mortality at 28 days was similar in LPV/r group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7).12 Chu and co-workers assessed the effects of LPV/r compared to historic controls treated with ribavirin only.13 Adverse events, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death within 21 days, were significantly lower in the LPV/r group than in the historic controls (2.4% vs. 28.8%, p < 0.001). In addition, a significant reduction in the need for rescue pulsed steroids (p < 0001) and significantly lower nosocomial infections were also noted in patients treated with LPV/r (p = 0.043). Chan and colleagues demonstrated that the addition of LPV/r as an initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate (2.3% vs 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs 11.0%) when compared with matched controls (both p < 0.05).14 In a nonhuman primate model of common marmosets, subjects with MERS-CoV treated with LPV/r or interferon-beta-1b had better prognoses than untreated subjects.15 In addition, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of MERS-CoV treated with a combination of LPV/r/interferon-beta-1b has been ongoing since 2016.16 Based on the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2, we prescribed LPV/r for our first two cases and presumed that it would suppress the viral load. Unfortunately, there was no obvious shortening effect on viral shedding in our limited dataset. In the future, peptides or small compounds that bind to carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cellular receptor for both SARS viruses, may be potential treatment agents.17 The effective treatment is lacking, and some clinical trials investigating the efficacy are conducting globally. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.18\n",
