Moreover, within this series, some C-terminal carboxamide derivatives showed restricted rotation around the N1\u2013CO bond, due to the stabilization of a \u03b3-turn-like folded conformation.14b To investigate further the structural and conformational issues within these azetidine derivatives and to determine their interest as antiviral agents, we initiated a program directed to the modification of compound 1, selected as a prototype (Fig. 1\n). To this end, diverse substituents have been built-in the C-terminal carboxamide moiety (A), amino acids with side-chains of different character were selected as C-terminal residues (B), and the N-terminal benzyloxycarbonyl group was replaced by different urethane, acyl and urea moieties containing aromatic groups (C).",

The good results in the synthesis of compounds 7 prompted us to apply a similar solid-phase approach for the preparation of the third series of derivatives (Scheme 3\n). In this case, the Fmoc-l-Ala resin 5g was deprotected and coupled to the Fmoc-azetidine derivative 8 to provide key intermediate 9. Unfortunately, this coupling step was difficult and, despite it was repeated, the Kaiser test indicated an incomplete incorporation. The direct cleavage of 9 afforded after purification the Fmoc-azetidine dipeptide 10a. Removal of the Fmoc-protecing group from 9 followed by reaction with different chloroformates or acyl- or sulfonyl-chlorides in the presence of propylene oxide gave to derivatives 10b\u2013g, after cleavage. Alternatively, the treatment with isocyanates, followed by exposure to the cleavage cocktail, allowed the preparation of urea analogues 10h\u2013i. In all these cases, only the major S,S-diastereoisomer of the mixture was isolated in enough purity for biological assays.

It is established that, in small peptides, values below 3 ppb/K (in absolute value) are indicative of solvent-protected NH, probably implicated in a hydrogen bond, while values above 4 ppb/K indicated accessibility to solvent or non-hydrogen-bonded states, and those between 3 and 4 ppb/K are in the range of uncertainty.18 As shown in the table, most compounds showed \u0394\u03b4/\u0394T values for the \u03b1-NH amide proton <3 ppb/K, while for a small number of them the values were not conclusive. These data point towards the stabilization of a \u03b3-turn structure through the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond implicating the \u03b1-NH amide proton. In contrast, the temperature coefficients for the C-terminal amide protons are large enough, indicating total accessibility to the solvent. The only exception was compound (R,S)-4b, for which the \u0394\u03b4/\u0394T values for both amide protons suggested either the coexistence of two conformational states, \u03b2- and \u03b3-turn or a single double-turned conformation.",

All the amide protons of peptides 11 and 12 showed temperature coefficients higher than 4.5 ppb/K, in absolute value, indicating random coil conformations, and therefore higher flexibility than azetidine-containing analogues. Both dipeptides were unable to inhibit the replication of HCMV in cell culture (Table 2), suggesting a key function of the azetidine ring in the observed antiviral activity.

In fact, small changes, such as the incorporation of different types of substituents at the aromatic phenyl ring (10b, 10c), the shortening of the benzyl group to phenyl (10d) and the replacement of the urethane oxygen atom by CH2 or NH (10g, 10h, 10i), led to inactive analogues.

Compounds modified at the C-terminal residue (carboxamide and amino acid side-chain) and at the N-terminus were easily synthesized by application of both solid-phase and solution methodologies. The results of the biological assays indicated quite strict structural requirements for activity. Thus, only derivatives with aliphatic groups at the C-terminal residue, either at the carboxamide moiety or at the side-chain showed significant inhibitory activity against HCMV replication in cell cultures. Additionally, at the C-carboxamide group, the presence of a hydrogen atom is an absolute requirement. Substitutions at N-terminus recommended the initial benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group as the best choice at this position. In addition, the conformational restriction induced by the reverse turn (\u03b3-type) seems important for activity, since more flexible dipeptide analogues were totally inactive. Further SAR studies are needed to improve the activity of the present series of inhibitors.",
