            "text": "The function of these enzymes is the cleavage of peptide or ester bonds for which a nucleophile is needed for the attack on the carbonyl group of the amide or ester bond to be cleaved. A large number of proteins use the OH or SH groups of a serine, threonine, or cysteine for this purpose. In the following chapters, we will see other cleaving enzymes that use a different mechanism. During the cleavage reaction of the hydrolases discussed in this chapter, a temporary covalent bond between substrate and enzyme is formed. This intermediate, the so-called acyl-enzyme form, occurs with serine, threonine, and cysteine proteases, but lipases, esterases, transpeptidases, and b-lactamases also use this reaction mechanism. The design of inhibitors for these enzymes that act via an acyl-enzyme intermediate shall be discussed. In the following two chapters, peptidases that use a water molecule for the primary attack on the peptide bond to be hydrolyzed shall be discussed: the aspartic and metallopeptidases. Depending on whether they cleave the amino acid chain at the N or C terminus or in the center, the peptidases are classified as amino-, carboxy-, or endopeptidases. Some of these proteases are relatively unspecific, whereas others are highly specific and only cleave very particular substrates. These latter enzymes have the best chances that a selective therapeutic inhibitor can be found causing only few side effects. Bacteria and viruses have also produced their own peptidases, the inhibition of which can be exploited for chemotherapeutic treatment. Because these proteins are not endogenous in humans, and therefore also have no function in us, their inhibition should lead to therapeutic success without risking severe side effects.",

            "text": "Serine proteases are the most extensive and best-studied class of peptidases. They are closely related to the esterases and lipases (hydrolases) that hydrolyze ester bonds. This enzyme class serves the human body in diverse ways. Some serine proteases, such as, the digestive enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin, cleave a broad spectrum of peptides and proteins. Others such as the coagulation enzymes thrombin and factor Xa are highly selective and only cleave very particular substrates. Frequently, proteases are expressed in a non-active precursor form, the so-called zymogens. To transform these into their active form, in many cases sequence segments of the zymogen polypeptide chain are cleaved that otherwise serve as endogenous inhibitors of the activated enzyme. The release of the active form can either occur by autocatalysis (e.g., trypsin) or by other activating proteases (e.g., the coagulation cascade). An active site serine side chain plays a decisive role in the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases, esterases, and lipases. It is characterized by an extraordinarily high chemical reactivity. In chymotrypsin, only this serine reacts with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), whereas 27 other serine residues in the enzyme remain unmodified. Upon chemical transformation with DFP, the enzyme completely loses its catalytic activity.",

The numbering of the amino acids in serine proteases of the chymotrypsin type is based on the sequence of chymotrypsin. The spatial structures of a large variety of serine proteases are now available, of which a few are listed in Table 23 .1. The structures show an extraordinarily pronounced similarity in the active site even for proteases that have entirely different folding patterns (\u25b6 Sect. 14.7, compare trypsin with subtilisin). This so-called catalytic triad of Ser-His-Asp is characteristic of serine proteases. In some of these enzymes, the aspartate can be replaced by a glutamate whereas some transpeptidases and b-lactamases display a lysine in place of the histidine in the active site.",

In this way, it compensates the positive charge that is formed on the histidine residue. To stabilize the transition state formed upon attack on the carbonyl group, serine proteases have another characteristic structural motif, the so-called oxyanion hole. This is a small pocket next to the side chain of Ser195 composed of two main-chain NH groups ( Fig. 23.1) . In a few cases, the terminal amide groups of asparagine or glutamine can accomplish this task. The function of the oxyanion hole is to stabilize the negative charge formed on the tetrahedral transition state and to distort the geometry of the attacked carbonyl carbon atom from a trigonal-planar to a tetrahedral configuration. The formed transition state collapses with release of the C-terminal cleavage product which carries a free amino group at its end. The N-terminal cleavage product remains covalently bound to the protease to give an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In a subsequent step, a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule again leads to a tetrahedral transition state. This finally collapses with release of the N-terminal cleavage product. The catalytic enzyme is then ready for the next transformation.",

In 1988, Paul Carter and James Wells prepared various mutants of the bacterial serine protease subtilisin (\u25b6 Sect. 14.7) at Genentech. Exchange of the catalytic serine or histidine for alanine leads to a reduction in the catalytic activity by more than six orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, exchange of the aspartic acid, the only function of which is to exchange a proton with histidine, reduced the catalytic activity by more than four orders of magnitude. The combined exchange of multiple amino acids of the catalytic triad led to no further reduction in the catalytic activity. The threefoldalanine mutant, in which the catalytic triad is completely removed, still cleaves the peptide substrate more than 1,000 times faster than the pure buffer solution! The substrate remaining binding sites and the oxyanion hole, the structure and properties of which stabilize the tetrahedral transition state, are responsible for this acceleration.",

For this task they use a series of more-or-less-pronounced binding pockets on their surface, as described in \u25b6 Chap. 14, \"Three-Dimensional Structure of Biomolecules\". These are structurally and electronically complementary to the side chains of the substrate. As a consequence, the polypeptide chain of the substrate will be immobilized on the surface in the vicinity of the catalytic site. The crevices on the surface look very different depending on the protease. Surface portions of four different serine proteases from the trypsin family are shown in Fig. 23 .2. A comparison of the different Fig. 23.2 The surface of the trypsin-like serine proteases trypsin, thrombin, factor VIIa, and factor Xa display deep pockets in the area of the catalytic site. To emphasize this surface structure better, the color of the surface changes from blue to green to red with increasing depth. The exposed physicochemical properties in the crevices determine the substrate selectivity of the protease. The preferred cleavage sequences are indicated in the structures, in which XXX represents an arbitrary amino acid at this position. serine proteases with different substrate specificities ( Fig. 23 .3) shows that, above all, the structures of the S 1 pockets of these enzymes are different. The S 1 pocket is largely formed of the sequence segments from 189-195 and 214-220. Significant differences are unique to the side chains of the amino acid at the positions 189, 216, and 226. In chymotrypsin, these are Ser189, Gly216, and Gly226. They tailor the depth and form of this pocket to accommodate the aromatic side chains of the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Correspondingly, chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide chains after one of these three amino acids. Trypsin also has a deep, spacious S 1 pocket that is flanked by Gly216 and Gly226. The negatively charged carboxylate group of Asp189 on the floor of the pocket is decisive for the recognition of long, positively charged side chains in the amino acids lysine and arginine in the substrate. In elastase, the S 1 pocket is shaped by the amino acids Val216 and Thr226. Because of this, the pocket is significantly smaller. It can only accommodate amino acids with short hydrophobic side chains such as alanine and valine. Amino acids with large groups are no longer accommodated. The amino acid 189, a serine, is buried. The substrate specificity of the described serine proteases is primarily achieved by the recognition of the amino acid in the P 1 position. The neighboring pockets, however, are also important for substrate binding and selectivity. It is remarkable that the substrate-binding pockets of serine proteases recognizing the N-terminal part of the substrate (unprimed side, S 1 -S 4 pockets; \u25b6 Sect. 14.5) are more prominently established. The pockets on the unprimed side that anchors the C-terminal part of the substrate are much less well developed. Because the N-terminal cleavage product remains temporarily covalently bound to the protease as an acyl-enzyme complex, this part of the substrate is bound particularly selectively.",

In favorable cases, the P 1 equivalent alone is sufficient, for example, in the trypsin and thrombin inhibitors 23.5 and 23.6, respectively ( Fig. 23.4) . However, the usually high chemical reactivity of the functional groups in covalently binding serine protease inhibitors, which is necessary to interact with the catalytically active serine, can be problematic. Because of their reactivity, such groups can also undergo undesirable reactions with serine residues from other enzymes and therefore cause side effects. The design of highly potent and selective inhibitors requires at least the occupancy of the S 2 , S 3 , and S 4 pockets. An additional structural characteristic that all serine proteases share in common should also be mentioned: Their substrates are bound to the peptide backbone via two antiparallel-oriented hydrogen bonds. This orientation of the two hydrogen-bonding partners leads to a pleated-sheet-like geometry. In most inhibitors, an attempt is made to imitate this hydrogen-bonding pattern ( Fig. 23.6 ).",

An injury to the arterial vascular system leads to the situation that membrane-bound tissue factor that is found outside the vessel comes into contact with the precursor of the serine protease, factor VII, in blood. The precursor is activated to factor VIIa, and induces the coagulation cascade. Different factors are released along the cascade, which are activated by proteases from the previous step from their zymogen form. Finally, the cascade leads to the release of \"von Willebrand factor,\" which binds to thrombocytes, and in doing so initiates the formation of a blood clot. In addition to extrinsic activation, there is also an intrinsic coagulation pathway. It is initiated by reduced blood flow or pathologically altered vasculature. In this case, the coagulation cascade is started to form a platelet aggregate, which is then stabilized by a fibrin network. Factor X is found in one of Fig. 23 .6 General binding mode of a peptide chain that is to be cleaved (gray carbon atoms) in the catalytic site of a serine protease. The amide bond to be cleaved is shown in yellow. The substrate's P 1 (light-blue) and P 2 groups (green) are shown with a surface; they bind in the S 1 and S 2 pockets of the protein. Two antiparallel-oriented hydrogen bonds (green) are formed to the main chain. The H-bonds to the oxyanion hole are in purple, and the direction of the nucleophilic attack of the Ser195 oxygen on the carbonyl carbon is indicated in blue.",

Until now, in particular developments for the enzymes thrombin, factor Xa, and factor VIIa have been tackled. This has already led to development candidates and marketed products for the first two. Thrombin transforms the inactive fibrinogen into reactive fibrin. It forms a polymer together with aggregated platelets in which different blood cells are trapped. A thrombus is formed, which is further cross-linked and stabilized by transglutaminase factor XIII (Sect. 23.8). This is an essential protective mechanism of the body to ensure wound closure. In particular diseases or situations, for example, after surgery, after a heart attack, or to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, it is necessary to reduce the coagulation capacity of the blood. For this reason, there is great interest in the development of selective, and above all, orally available coagulation cascade inhibitors. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen between the amino acids arginine and glycine. This sequence served as a starting point for the development of the first synthetic thrombin inhibitors that therefore possessed either an Arg or an Arg-analogous building block.",

In the early 1970s, the Japanese group of Hamao Umezawa established that peptide aldehydes with C-terminal arginine residues that are isolated from bacteria are potent inhibitors of some trypsin-like serine proteases. The tripeptide aldehydes that were investigated by S\u00e1ndor Bajusz were derived from the amino acids P 3 -P 1 or P 3 0 -P 1 0 , that are the three amino acids \"before\" and \"after\" the cleavage site. The relative binding affinity of a few peptide aldehydes are summarized in Table 23 .3. Interestingly, the direct comparison of Gly-Val-Arg-H and Gly-Pro-Arg-H shows that a proline in the P 2 position inhibits thrombin about ninefold more strongly. The introduction of phenylalanine instead of glycine in the P 3 position leads to an additional significant increase in the binding. Then, D-amino acids were investigated in position P 3 . Surprisingly, these led to a dramatic improvement in binding affinity. This result was not expected if one considers that the substrate sequence from P 5 to P 3 Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Arg contains only achiral glycine residues without lipophilic side chains that can hardly form any interactions that would correspond to the D-Phe side chain. When the above-described work was carried out, the spatial structure of thrombin had not yet been determined. Wolfram Bode and Milton Stubbs managed to elucidate the structure of a thrombin complex with a chemically activated fibrinopeptide, Gly-Asp-Phe-Leu-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gly-Val-Arg-CH 2 Cl. This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal portion from P 11 to P 1 that thrombin cleaves from fibrinogen. The comparison of this structure with that of D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone ( Fig. 23 .7) provided an explanation for the structure-reactivity relationship found by S\u00e1ndor Bajusz. The S 3 pocket is filled by both ligands; in the case of the fibrinopeptide, it is achieved by the side chains of leucine and phenylalanine in the positions P 8 and P 9 . The peptide forms a b-turn that enables the amino acids in this sequence to be positioned in the S 3 pocket. The same pocket is accessed by the tripeptide through the side chain of the D-amino acid at position P 3 .",

Luckily, the structures of NAPAP in complex with thrombin and also with trypsin are known ( Fig. 23 .12). A comparison of the 3D structures shows that there is a significant difference in the binding mode between the two enzymes in the S 3 pocket that leads The thrombin inhibitors NAPAP 23.10, CRC 220 23.11, the latter was developed at the former Behringwerke, and 23.12 which was derived from 23.10.

In thrombin, the S 3 pocket is more pronounced and is surrounded by multiple lipophilic amino acid side chains. In trypsin the top end of this pocket is open, and is spatially hardly restricted at all. Obviously its structuring is not necessary in the largely unspecific digestive enzyme. Therefore, the selectivity can be increased by occupying the S 3 pocket of thrombin as optimally as possible.

Benzamidine was known to be a weak thrombin inhibitor that occupies the S 1 pocket. It has, however, the disadvantage that it binds more strongly to trypsin (Fig. 23.4) . Accordingly, the researchers in Basel initially sought a small molecule that binds more strongly to thrombin than trypsin. More than 200 small molecules were tested in this narrowly focused search. Structures were chosen only if their functional groups were able to interact with the negatively charged side chain of Asp189. Guanidines, amidines, and amines were investigated. N-Amidinopiperidine (23.13, Fig. 23 .13) was identified as an interesting lead structure. In contrast to benzamidine, amidinopiperidine binds more strongly to thrombin (K i \u00bc 150 mM) than to trypsin (K i \u00bc 300 mM). A systematic derivatization led to 23.14, a moderately active thrombin inhibitor (K i \u00bc 0.48 mM). Based on the structural model with the protease, it appeared obvious that the replacement of the glycine unit with a D-amino acid, for example, D-Phe, should fill a lipophilic pocket and lead to a distinct increase in the affinity. The compound was quickly prepared and tested. In fact, 23.15 bound tenfold more strongly to thrombin. Other D-amino acids were then investigated and additional affinity could be achieved. High selectivity against trypsin was also encouraging; 23.16 binds 840-fold more strongly to thrombin than to trypsin. The surprise was great when the 3D structure of 23.14 in complex with thrombin was determined: The compound binds differently than predicted in the binding pocket! In contrast to the original assumption, the naphthylsulfonyl group exchanged positions with the benzyl side chain. The incorporation of a non-proteinogenic amino acid proved to be unfavorable from a synthetic point of view. Therefore, other central building blocks were sought that were synthetically more easily accessible. This work finally led to napsagatran 23.17, a highly potent and exceedingly selective substance. Because it is only intravenously applicable, however, it never found its way to a marketed product, particularly because argatroban, a marketed product for intravenous use, was discovered much earlier and was already available.",

The compound is a double prodrug of the actual active substance melagatran. Its relation to the initial parent structures (e.g., the tripeptide sequence D-Phe-Pro-Arg) is still quite apparent. The head group of the arginine residue was replaced with a benzamidine, the five-membered ring of the proline was narrowed to a four-membered ring, and the terminal benzyl group was shortened to a cyclohexyl ring. The N terminus was substituted with a methylenecarboxylic acid group. It proved to be extremely difficult to make the thrombin inhibitors adequately bioavailable and to maintain the necessary plasma level over an acceptable length of time. With regard to the bioavailability, AstraZeneca, in collaboration with the group of Bernd Clement at the University of Kiel, pursued a double prodrug strategy: The terminal acid function was masked as an ester, and the benzamidine group was transformed into an N-hydroxyamidine. The release of the active substance, melagatran, in the body is made possible by ubiquitously present esterases and a set of three reductases. AstraZenecca withdrew Ximelagatran (Exanta \u00ae ) after 2 years because some issues with liver toxicity were observed in a small number of cases after weeks of use.",

It also has a benzamidine anchor, and it has a pyridine group for the hydrophobic S 3 pocket. A benzimidazole building block with an attached amide bond was chosen as a linker between these groups. As with ximelagatran, it uses a carboxylic acid on the N terminus. It shows distinctly less peptide character than the lead structures. A double prodrug strategy was also used for this substance to make it adequately bioavailable. In addition to the esterification of the acid group, the amidine group was masked as a carbamoyl moiety.

In contrast to thrombin, elastase does not have a deep, pronounced S 1 pocket with an acidic amino acid, through which a polar contact to a ligand can be made. It accepts only substrates with small hydrophobic amino acids such as valine (Fig. 23.3) . If a large binding contribution cannot be expected by occupying the S 1 pocket, as is in the case with thrombin, the catalytic serine itself can be involved in the protein-ligand interaction by forming a reversible covalent bond with the inhibitor. Such a concept was pursued at the former ICI (today part of AstraZeneca) by starting with a trifluoromethylketone R-COCF 3 as a reversible, covalent-binding serine protease inhibitor. By starting from the substrate sequence, potent elastase inhibitors were found such as 23.21 and 23.22 (Fig. 23.14) .",

They both have an aspartic acid on the bottom of their deep S 1 pockets, similarly to thrombin. Moreover, a narrow and deep S 3 pocket that is flanked by aromatic amino acids (Tyr99, Trp215, and Phe174) is specific to factor Xa. Therefore, this pocket is ideally suited for aromatic groups on inhibitors. As already mentioned, in the mid-1990s a dogma prevailed that the S 1 pocket of trypsin-like serine proteases could only accept groups with basic character. protruding into the S 1 pocket. So much affinity was gained by the accommodation of additional groups in the deep, aromatic S 3 pocket that these compounds bind to the protease with single-digit-nanomolar values without the benzamidine anchor. Such a derivative was introduced by AstraZeneca (23.30, Fig. 23.19 ). In addition to the development of compounds with chloro-substituted aromatic rings for the S 1 pocket, other inhibitors with benzamidine groups were also synthesized as factor Xa inhibitors. However, it is much more difficult to achieve adequate selectivity compared to other trypsin-like serine proteases with these derivatives. Furthermore, they showed similar problems with regard to bioavailability as the thrombin inhibitors. Bayer HealthCare introduced a new factor Xa inhibitor to the market in September 2008, rivaroxaban (Xarelto \u00ae ; 23.31, Fig. 23.18 and 23.19 ), that places a chlorothiophene group in the S 1 pocket. Other companies are working on inhibitors with comparable chloroaromatic groups to fill the S 1 pocket. The subnanomolar-binding inhibitor apixaban 23.34 from Bristol-Myers Squibb has recently been approved for market. It foregoes the halogen group for the interaction in the S 1 pocket completely. As a crystal structure shows, the p-methoxy group displaces the water molecules that are almost always in the S 1 pocket. The previously mentioned compounds that lack a benzamidine group show better bioavailability and good selectivity for factor Xa. Attempts were also undertaken to develop dual inhibitors for thrombin and factor Xa. By inhibiting both proteins together, not additive, but rather synergistic antithrombotic effects are achieved that hopefully expand the therapeutic scope.",

When this happens, factor VIIa and the membrane-bound tissue factor can form a complex that causes a change in the conformation of the protease's catalytic domain.

The drug design for these target enzymes has benefitted strongly from the experience gained with the thrombin inhibitors. The concepts learned there are well transferred to the special conditions of these proteins. Tryptase, urokinase, and matriptase belong to this family. Tryptase inhibitors are being investigated for the treatment of asthma, and the two others are target structures for possible cancer therapeutics. Tryptase is a tetramer with four trypsin-like catalytic sites. These sites are separated from one another by several angstroms. To develop selective inhibitors, compounds were designed that carry two benzamidine-like anchor groups and a long enough bridge to link them together. In this way, two of the four sites in the tetrameric tryptase molecule are simultaneously blocked. The disadvantage of this design concept is that the developed inhibitors are very large. They are well over the molecular weight limit of 600 Da, which should not be exceeded for good bioavailability. The protease furin also belongs to the family of serine proteases; however, it adopts the folding of the subtilisin family (\u25b6 Sect. 14.7). It is involved in the maturation of proproteins. In this way, the envelope proteins of viruses are cleaved to transform them into their active form. Its involvement in the \"arming\" of viruses was even reported upon in the tabloid press: In the BILD-Zeitung in Germany on August 28, 2003, furin was referred to as the \"the most brutal protein in the world\" that \"makes epidemics a deadly danger for humans and acts like a detonator on a bomb.\" Furin and other closely related subtilases cleave particular basic tetrapeptide sequences C-terminally: Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)-Arg-. Many glycoproteins of lipidenveloped viruses are cleaved at this recognition sequence and consequently activated. An example of this is the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that contain such cleavage sequences in hemagglutinin, one of the surface glycoproteins. Fig. 23.19 ) in factor Xa.

            "text": "Serine peptidases use the OH group of an endogenous serine as an attacking nucleophile. The neighboring histidine residue mediates the temporary proton transfer, and the aspartate compensates for the intermediately occurring charge on the imidazole ring of the histidine. A special feature is, however, the temporary covalent bond between the N-terminal part of the substrate and the enzyme. Many other hydrolytically cleaving enzymes use an analogous principle. Esterases and lipases also have a catalytic triad. Occasionally an aspartate is exchanged for a glutamate in these enzymes. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine acts on many synapses in the vegetative nervous system and is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. It binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, among others and activates this ion channel (\u25b6 Sect. 30.4) . Acetylcholine must be removed to limit the duration of the transmission process and to reset the receptor to the starting point. An imbalance in this nerve impulse transmission system leads to acute and chronic movement disorders. Acetylcholinesterase is responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine. Inhibitors of this enzyme are used to treat shaking palsy (Parkinson's disease). More recent research has also explored their potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase has a catalytic triad made of serine, histidine, and glutamate. Acetylcholine (3.46, \u25b6 Fig. 2.11) is cleaved by the enzyme in that its acetyl group is transferred to the catalytic serine; hydrolysis releases acetic acid slowly from the esterase. The drug (S)-rivastigmine is also attacked by the catalytic serine, and its carbamoyl group is transferred. Because of the enhanced stability of the carbamoyl-enzyme complex, the esterase is then only very slowly deacylated and regenerated for the next transformation. This causes an inhibition of the target enzyme for several hours. Cholinesterase inhibitors are also used as insecticides. Active substances such as paraoxon 23.37 (Fig. 23.21) , parathione (E605) 23.38, propoxur 23.39, or malathione 23.40 contain phosphoric acid esters or thioesters that are virtually irreversibly transferred to the catalytic serine.

Although the structural architecture of transpeptidases and b-lactamases is very similar, the sequence identity is small. Nonetheless, a transpeptidase has been equipped with the hydrolytic properties of a lactamase by selective mutagenesis! Only a few amino acid exchanges were needed for this. Above all, the hydrophobic amino acids such as phenylalanine and tryptophan are the ones that protect the acyl-enzyme complex from hydrolysis in the transpeptidase. In contrast, polar amino acids such as glutamic acid (Fig. 23.24 , Glu166) are found in the same positions in the lactamases. In contrast to the transpeptidase's hydrophobic amino acids, these anchor and activate a water molecule in the correct orientation for nucleophilic attack on the acyl-enzyme complex in the lactamases.

Unsubstituted penicillic acid 23.46 is quickly cleaved by TEM-1b-lactamase (Fig. 23.24 ).

This group should be located in exactly the position from where the water molecule would start its nucleophilic attack on the acyl-enzyme form. In fact, derivative 23.47 inactivates TEM-1b-lactamase. A water molecule was detected in the vicinity of the CH 2 OH group in the subsequently determined crystal structure, but it is too far away to successfully hydrolyze the acyl-enzyme. The hydroxyl group therefore blocks the attack of a water molecule on the ester carbonyl group of the acyl-enzyme. The incorporation of such a hydroxymethyl group has been undertaken in important b-lactamase-resistant b-lactams such as imipenem 23.48 or meropenem 23.49 (Fig. 23.25) . b-Lactamases can also be irreversibly inhibited.

This tumor disease is based on the malignant transformation of plasma cells, the physiological function of which is to produce antibodies for immune defense. Even though bortezomib cannot heal multiple myeloma, its use can extend life of patients for whom other therapies have failed. In multiple myeloma, the plasma cells produce massive amounts of misfolded proteins that must be digested by the proteasome. Therefore these cells need a proteasome that functions optimally; otherwise apoptosis would be induced. Blocking the proteasome function is therefore desirable for such cells. Moreover these cells are significantly more sensitive to bortezomib therapy than normal cells. Some tumor cells also activate a transcription factor, NF-kB, which controls the proliferation and survival of the tumor cells. The proteasome is critical for the activation of NF-kB because it degrades an inhibitor of this transcription factor that acts as a kind of emergency brake on NF-kB. Therefore the inhibition of the proteasome serves to keep NF-kB in its benign form, because its inhibiting binding partner is no longer being degraded. It is possible that bortezomib induces apoptosis of tumor cells in that it stabilizes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (\u25b6 Sect. 26.2) as well as the tumor-suppressor protein p53.",

Its triad is composed of a nucleophilic cysteine as well as a histidine and an asparagine. The asparagine adopts the role of the aspartate in the serine protease. The catalytic mechanism is comparable to that of serine proteases. Even the oxyanion hole (Cys25 and Gln119) is found in proteases from the papain family. There are indications that the transition state is structurally similar to the acyl-enzyme intermediate. An attempt has been made to exchange serine for cysteine in trypsin. The binding properties for the substrate (K m value) remained virtually the same, but the catalytic rate of the reaction decreased by five orders of magnitude. Even though the structures are geometrically nearly unchanged, the experiment shows that the difference between serine and cysteine proteases is more complicated than a simple exchange of sulfur for oxygen.

Another group is the calcium-dependent calpains, their hydrolytic domain has a very similar folding to papain. They occur in many cells and carry out different functions. Calpains occur in higher concentrations at sites of cell damage such as after traumatic brain injury, stroke, or during the formation of cataracts in the eye. Calpains seem to be regulatory enzymes. For example, they reduce the blood flow through vessels in cases of injury to limit blood loss. During a stroke, this natural protective function unfortunately leads to the contrary situation: Activation of calpains reduces the blood flow, and parts of the brain become ischemic. Destruction of the affected brain cells is the result. Specific inhibitors could counteract the over-functioning of the calpains.

Interestingly, some of the pockets on the C-terminal side (the primed side, S 1 0 -S 4 0 ) of cysteine proteases are strongly structured. This can be exploited for the design of potential inhibitors. Papain prefers substrates with hydrophobic P 2 and P 3 groups. An aspartate is recognized as a P 1 group by caspases of the second folding family. For these reasons, many inhibitors that have been developed for caspases carry a functional group with a carboxylic acid group or a corresponding mimetic at this position. The interaction with the thiol group of the catalytic cysteine is decisive for the binding of cysteine protease inhibitors to their target enzyme. It is interesting that many of the developed inhibitors try to involve the sulfur atom in a covalent bond. Reversible and irreversible head groups have been developed for this purpose. The complex of the inhibitor leupeptin 23.52, a natural product with an aldehyde function, with calpain II is shown in Fig. 23 .27. This group reacts with the thiol group of cysteine and forms a hemithioacetal. Leupeptin binds with high affinity to many members of the papain family. In addition to the aldehyde head group, many other functionalities (so-called warheads) that can be used to inhibit cysteine proteases are known (Fig. 23.28 ). Such irreversible inhibitors have been developed in cases of viral proteases and have a Michael-acceptor group at their disposal (i.e., 23.53). This reactive group forms an irreversible bond with cysteine and switches the enzyme off permanently. An attempt has been made to develop inhibitors for cathepsins, calpains, and caspases that can form a reversible connection to the thiol group. Most of these structures are derived from aldehydes or ketones (23.53-23.57). From a chemical point of view, the caspase inhibitor 23.56 from Vertex is interesting. In a cyclic structure, it combines an aspartate-like side chain for the S 1 pocket of the enzyme and a capped aldehyde function in the form of a cyclic acetal. The aldehyde is released as active compound from this prodrug.",

            "text": "Another group of enzymes that actually belongs to the family of transferases, but follows a cysteine-protease-like mechanism, are the transglutaminases. Nine isoenzymes have been discovered in our genome. They are constructed from four domains and contain a catalytic domain composed of a Cys-His-Asp triad. Their task is the posttranslational modification of proteins (\u25b6 Sect. 26.2), that is, they modify proteins after they have been synthesized in the ribosome. As one aspect, they can carry out the deamination of glutamine residues to glutamate. Furthermore, they catalyze the cross-linking of chain strands on proteins by the transaminase reaction. For this the terminal amino group of a lysine is coupled with a glutamate group with the formation of an isopeptide bond. A proteolytically stable cross-linking results so that transglutaminases can be compared to \"biological glue.\" Their reaction is analogous to the cysteine proteases. A nucleophilic cysteine initially forms an acyl-enzyme with the substrate's glutamine with loss of ammonia, which is cleaved in the next step by the reactive lysine. A protein cross-link is the result. Transaminases take on many tasks in our bodies and above all they stabilize tissue proteins. In the blood coagulation cascade, the transglutaminase factor XIII stabilizes the initially formed clot by cross-linking (Sect. 23.4). Therefore inhibitors for factor XIII could be potent anticoagulants. Other transglutaminases are also being investigated as possible targets for drug development. Transglutaminase-2 (TGT2) plays an important role in celiac disease, which is a type of gluten intolerance. Patients that have this disease are sensitive to gluten, which occurs in many grain products as an adhesive protein. They develop inflammation in the mucous membranes of the small intestines, which leads to the destruction of intestinal epithelial cells and severely limits their ability to extract nutrients from food. Inhibitors of TG2 could represent a therapeutic approach. Inhibitors for transglutaminases can be developed by following analogous principles as in the case of the cysteine protease inhibitors. . 23 .28 In addition to the aldehyde head group, many other functionalities have been developed that reversibly or irreversibly couple (reactive site is marked in red) to the catalytic cysteine and in doing so block cysteine proteases. Irreversible inhibitors such as 23.52 that have a Michael-acceptor group are available for viral proteases. The two aldehydes 23.54 and 23.55 are development substances for the inhibition of calpains; 23.56 and 23.57 are caspase inhibitors. Compound 23.56 is a prodrug that releases an aspartate-like P 1 side chain with ring opening and forms a thiohemiacetal with the protein with its newly generated aldehyde function.",

Depending on where they cleave a peptide chain, they are classified as amino-, carboxy-, or endopeptidases. \u2022 Three amino acids, a serine, a histidine, and an aspartic acid that reside at quite distant positions in the sequence, are folded in characteristic proximity to one another. The hydroxyl oxygen atom of the serine performs a nucleophilic attack onto the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond. Its nucleophilicity is enhanced by an H-bond to an adjacent imidazole moiety of a histidine. \u2022 The histidine accepts a proton from the nucleophilic serine OH group and is thereby transposed into a positively charged state. The neighboring aspartate residue compensates for the positive charge. The simultaneously created negative charge on the former carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by NH functions in the H-bond-donating oxyanion hole. Simultaneously, the carbon atom of the cleaving amide bond rearranges to a tetrahedral geometry. \u2022 Upon release of the N-terminal part of the peptide substrate the C-terminal part remains covalently bound as acyl-enzyme complex. This is finally degraded via a similar mechanism by using a water molecule as a nucleophile. \u2022 The residues involved can be different; in particular, the nucleophilic serine can be replaced by a threonine or cysteine. The corresponding enzymes are named threonine and cysteine proteases. \u2022 The peptide chain to be cleaved is primarily recognized in small binding pockets on the protease surface that accommodate the amino acid side chains on the C-terminal end adjacent to the cleavage site. Their composition determines the chemical building blocks required for inhibitor design to develop highly potent ligands for the protease. \u2022 A number of warhead groups are known to either reversibly or irreversibly block the catalytic serine, threonine, or cysteine residue. \u2022 The major contribution to binding affinity and ligand specificity is achieved through binding to the S 1 pocket next to the cleavage site. \u2022 Blood coagulation is a highly regulated cascade of serine proteases. Potent inhibitors for antithrombotic therapy have been developed for thrombin and factor Xa, which are located in the last steps of the cascade. \u2022 Whereas thrombin and factor Xa exhibit deep and well-structured S 1 pockets, elastase exhibits a flat S 1 pocket. Binding to this pocket contributes much less to the overall affinity of an inhibitor for this protease and the developed compounds all involve the catalytic serine in a reversible covalent attachment.",

However, instead of cleaving a peptide bond in the main chain, they form an isopeptide bond between the terminal amino group of a lysine and the carboxylate group of a glutamate.
