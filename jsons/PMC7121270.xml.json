            "text": "Ellipsometry was used already 1932 for studies of organic monolayers by Tronsted et al. [1], but Vroman [2], Rothen and Mathot [3] and Stromberg et al. [4] were most likely among the first to report measurements on protein layers. Azzam et al. [5] demonstrated similar results in studies of immunological reactions and also provided a theoretical framework. Their pioneering work included studies of kinetics of protein adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces. These early investigators found ellipsometry to be a suitable tool for non-destructive analysis of thin films, both ex situ as well as in situ at a solid/liquid interface, but surprisingly the use of the technique for protein adsorption studies during the last 40 years has been limited to a few laboratories.1 In addition, with a few exceptions, the types of applications are generally very simple and often limited to single wavelength measurements. This may be due to that most users in the field have a background in biochemistry or medicine and not are sufficiently trained in optics and physics to make full use of the technique. The development in the field during this period has been reviewed several times [6\u201313].",

These three characteristics facilitate studies of central phenomena in protein adsorption research including competitive adsorption of proteins, protein layer structure and dynamics, protein interaction on surfaces and protein exchange reactions and more. Studies under flow is an example on an additional possibility. It is no doubt that ellipsometry is a convenient and excellent tool to study surface dynamics in biological systems. This major advantage is particular important since living systems are by definition continuously changing and rely on chemical processes, molecular transport, synthesis and degradation.",

For the research applications, the available ellipsometers on the market have precision, speed and general performance to match the requirements for high-precision bioadsorption studies. It is fair to say that the instrument problem is solved in this context. Of course, depending on the actual scientific question addressed, there are always technical challenges related to how to expose proteins to a surface: in situ or ex situ adsorption; flowing or static adsorption conditions; solution stirring or not; temperature control; etc.",

In in vitro studies of protein adsorption one may always question if the model surface used is relevant. Ellipsometry has this problem in common with many other techniques but a special limitation for ellipsometry is that a relatively flat surface at least a few square mm2 large is required. Adsorption studies on curved surfaces or small particles are not possible. Many ellipsometric protein adsorption studies are traditionally performed on silicon wafers2 which are extremely flat and lend themselves to surface modification by silanization to change their surface chemistry, physics and energy. Another commonly used material is gold which can be modified using thiol chemistry. From an optical point of view, these two types of surfaces are excellent and provide high optical contrast to protein layers and are readily available. However, the critical question about the biological relevance should always be asked. The second challenge, evaluation of the primary data \u03a8 and \u0394, is a central problem in ellipsometry. For protein layers the main issue is how to simultaneously determine layer thickness and layer refractive index. This will be discussed in some detail in the following sections.",

The evaluation problem is solved in the sense that sufficient sensitivity is obtainable to detect small amounts of adsorbed protein on a surface. However, ellipsometry is not a method for chemical identification, so chemical and biological specificity must be achieved through biorecognition. This is a central challenge but is rather a biochemical issue than an ellipsometric. The main ellipsometric challenge is on the instrumental side. There are several concepts proposed but systems suitable for clinical tests are not readily available. To be competitive, a system also must be simple to operate and maintain and proof of concept must be well documented.

Most cells are home made and adapted to the particular needs of the experiments conducted. Among the most important factors is how liquids are mixed in the cell. In some designs a flow system is included but it is very hard to avoid dead (unstirred) volumes and there is always an unstirred layer close to the surface under test. Molecules always must diffuse over this layer. Magnetic stirring is often used and has the advantage that the same liquid is in the cell all the time compared to a in flow system. Cells also have windows and proper windows characterization must be performed and included in the data evaluation in a similar manner as for windows in vacuum systems.

However, this change is very fast and occurs as soon as mixing is complete (within seconds), whereas a change due to molecular adsorption on the surface occurs slower (tens of seconds or slower) due to diffusion over the unstirred layer at the interface. To consider in the evaluation of data is also that molecules do not only adsorb on the surface\u2014molecules also desorb at the same time, i.e there is a replacement.

The above methods use numerical inversion to find N at fixed d. However, if k=0 is assumed, one can use analytic inversion. A fifth degree polynomial equation is then obtained. It can be readily solved and was applied at the air/water interface to layers of arachidic acid and valine gramicidin A with thickness in the range of 2 to 3 nm [31]. An alternative to wavelength-by-wavelength analysis is to include dispersion models for N as shown by Berlind et al.

For a more flexible protein, conformation changes may occur upon adsorption but still one cannot expect an ideal homogeneous layer with flat parallel boundaries. Density is strongly related to n and various effective medium approximations (EMA) are used. A very simple density modeling can be done if n for a (more) dense protein layer is known as examplified by determination of a density deficiency of 30 % of a BSA layer on platinum [6] compared to a nominally dense BSA layer on HgCdTe. Ellipsometry can in principle provide n for thin layers as discussed above but it has not been proven yet to have sensitivity to resolve in-depth density profiles for protein monolayers as can be done with neutron reflectometry [39, 40]. However, for thicker protein layers, density depth-profiling is possible as shown by Kozma et al. [41]. They studied several hundred nm thick flagellar filament protein layers on surface activated Ta2O3. The protein layers were described by five EMA sublayers. By fitting this model to spectroscopic ellipsometry data, they determined the in-depth variation in surface mass density.",

During the whole adsorption process, d is more or less constant except for low \u0393 where noise is seen. The dimensions of IgG are 23.5\u00d74.5\u00d74.5 nm and Malmsten concluded that IgG has a near end-on orientation. The relatively low n and \u0393 show in addition that the layer has low packing density. Fibrinogen showed a more complex dynamics with a near-linear change in both n and d [27]. \n",

            "text": "Further structural studies with ellipsometry along these lines but also including multilayer adsorption were performed by Berlind et al. [32] who studied fibrinogen covalently bonded on functionalized silicon surfaces using affinity ligand coupling chemistry. Adsorption of fibrinogen was monitored in situ with ellipsometry at \u03bb=500 nm and ellipsometric spectra were measured at steady-state in the range 350\u20131050 nm. Figure 2.4 shows d and n during multistep adsorption and in situ chemical activation of fibrinogen layers evaluated on a \u03bb-by-\u03bb basis. Figure 2.5 shows the corresponding change in \u0393 calculated with de Feijter et al.\u2019s formula in Eq. (2.3). Fibrinogen matrices with thickness up to 58 nm and with surface mass density \u0393 of 1.6 \u03bcg/cm2 were prepared in this way. The first adsorption step results in a fibrinogen layer with \u0393=1 \u03bcg/cm2. A chemical activation using ethyl-3-dimethyl-aminopropyl-carbodiimide and N-hydroxy-succinimide (EDC/NHS) methodology was then performed with intention to promote binding of the next fibrinogen layer. However, only a small thickness increase was observed upon a second fibrinogen adsorption step. Furthermore \u0393 increases monotonically during the whole experiment and when n or d decreases, \u0393 remains constant, i.e. no desorption occurs. This thickness decrease is accompanied with an index increase supporting a densification of the fibrinogen layer. A proposed structural model for the fibrinogen layer is shown in Fig. 2.5 and is further discussed in [32]. Earlier single-\u03bb ellipsometry experiments with ex situ activation and incubation showed very different results [42] with a considerable increase in \u0393 after each incubation step more or less proportional to the number of incubation/activation steps performed. These differences are most probably due to the drying steps in the ex situ case. \n\n",

Even if there is an order, an isotropic layer is normally assumed if the molecules not are uniaxial or biaxial. However, there are some indications that protein molecules can be uniaxial. Sano [43] showed that structural anisotropy in BSA leads to uniaxial molecules with n of 1.744 and 1.563 along the major and minor axes, respectively. In addition there may be form induced birefringence in protein layers as briefly discussed in the methodology section above. Of course, the resolving power of ellipsometry on protein films may be insufficient to resolve their anisotropy regardless of being intrinsic or form induced. In highly ordered, but thin films of fatty acids prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett techniques, Engelsen [44] demonstrated that anisotropic modeling is relevant. Future refinement of ellipsometric methodology will tell if anisotropy of protein films will add to further understanding of their properties and structure.",

The advantage is that vibrational signatures can be correlated to the secondary structures in protein molecules [34]. However, surprisingly few reports on application of infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) for studies of protein layers are found in the literature in spite of that IRSE has the advantage to provide a quantification of the amount of protein on a surface, i.e. to determine the layer thickness in addition to the IR spectral features. The limited use of IRSE may be due to that the instrumentation is rather expensive and slow. With a pyroelectric DTGS detector, a typical measurement on a protein monolayer may take 12 h or more but using other types of detectors can shorten the measurement time. A rather large sample area of several mm2 is also required. The speed and sample size can be reduced by employing synchrotron infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry as shown by Hinrichs et al. [45]. They studied peptides, proteins and their antibodies and could in particular identify the so called amide bands [19].",

For a multilayer with ten alternating HSA and anti-HSA layers with a total thickness of 40.2 nm, it was found that heating to 120 \u2218C reduced the thickness around 1 nm and that mainly the amide A band was affected as observed in N.

The Isoscope or comparison ellipsometer [47] and the fixed polarizer ellipsometer [48] are two examples of suggested point-of-care systems. Also imaging ellipsometry were suggested many years ago as a high through-put system for biosensing [14, 49]. It seems that ellipsometry as a biosensor principle not finds its way from research to clinical laboratories. No user-friendly and cost-efficient instruments suitable for clinical use are commercially available. In spite of this, suggestions for biosensing applications continues to be published which indicates that researches are believers in its potential.

They found that a thicker polyester film resulted in a lower BSA adsorption probably coupled to a higher hydrophilicity. Warenda et al. [69] studied HSA interaction with oligosaccharide-modified hyperbranched poly(ethylene imine) films and found that HSA adsorption was below 50 ng/cm2 under certain conditions. A low protein adsorption is crucial for the use of these films in biosensors.
