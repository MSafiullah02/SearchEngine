The detection methods consisted of virus culture, antigen detection and serology.

            "text": "In the 1990s, a new era began with the development of molecular amplification-based techniques (PCR, polymerase chain reaction). Not only did PCR revolutionize the detection sensitivity of known viruses but it also enabled the discovery of altogether new respiratory viruses in the respiratory tract, including the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), new coronaviruses, the human bocavirus (HBoV), HRV-C group and polyomaviruses.4 Molecular methods detect currently one or more respiratory viruses in up to 95% of children with bronchiolitis, acute wheezing or asthma, and in up to 72% of children with pneumonia (Table 1\n).5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 PCR has achieved wide use in clinical virology, and is displacing the conventional methods with the exception of commercial rapid antigen detection tests for influenza virus and RSV. The high sensitivity of PCR has, on the other hand, shown that viruses in asymptomatic children (up to 40-68% during high prevalence seasons) and virus coinfections - or rather codetections - in symptomatic children are common (up to 43% in acute asthma).5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 This has raised concerns not only of causality but also whether upper airway specimens really reflect the conditions in the lower airways with regard to viral replication, since the mere presence of a virus may not be etiologically related to the patient's symptoms. In this paper, we review the latest achievements in the molecular diagnostics of respiratory viral infections and discuss their applicability to lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTI) in children.",

The first PCRs were single-target endpoint assays which allowed product detection only at the endpoint of the PCR amplification. With RNA viruses, reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) needs to be used: reverse transcriptase first converts RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) after which ordinary PCR may be performed. The final PCR or RT-PCR product must be certified to be correct DNA, e.g. by a post-PCR hybridization with a labelled probe. Increased specificity and sensitivity can be achieved by nested PCR in which two sequential pairs of primers are used instead of one (Table 2). The first or outer pair yields a DNA fragment, as is the case in a standard PCR. Then, in a subsequent PCR, a second pair of primers, called nested or inner primers, binds within the first PCR product (amplicon) to yield a shorter DNA fragment. This makes the PCR more sensitive but also more prone to contamination. Moreover, were a non-specific amplicon created in the first round, it would not be amplified in the second round (i.e. increased specificity). PCRs like these result in either a \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d result, but the result is not quantitative.",

            "text": "Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a method that not only detects specific DNA or RNA in a sample, but also quantifies it. By modern techniques this is achieved by automatic and computerized PCR devices (Figure 1\n). One or more fluorescent probes, specific for the target DNA, can be applied into the same reaction mixture together with the target, primers, nucleotides and polymerase; now hybridization occurs at each PCR cycle. The emitted fluorescent signals correlate with the amount of PCR product produced. The PCR device measures fluorescence once every cycle, i.e., data is retrieved online and at real time.

Many children with respiratory illness turned also out to have virus coinfections \u2013 sometimes no less than five respiratory virus species concomitantly.5, 11, 14 Since the clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory virus infections overlap and are seldom pathognomonic for any specific virus and since the sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods is low, the need for testing for multiple viruses simultaneously by PCR became apparent.2, 3 Multiplex PCR is defined as running more than one PCR analysis in a single reaction tube.16 This is accomplished by applying more than one set of primers that produce amplicons of varying sizes and are specific for different, individual viral sequences (Figure 1).

The hybridized beads are finally read by the Luminex system. The multiplex PCR assays have generally been much more sensitive than conventional viral diagnostics23, 24, 25, 26, 27 with specificity and sensitivity similar to those of single-target PCRs (Table 3\n).25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 There are, however, slight virus-specific differences between multiplex PCRs and single-target PCRs. These differences seem to vary, and in some studies, multiplex PCRs have been less sensitive than a single-target PCR for RSV, human metapneumovirus, enteroviruses, PIV or adenovirus.25, 26, 28, 29, 31\n",

A recent study showed that children with LRTI have an increased total virus load and harbor more viruses in their NPA than children with no LRTI but with upper respiratory tract infection, fever or cough.42 Individual loads of HRV and PIV-2 were higher in LRTI than in non-LRTI, and qPCR yielded more viruses (including coinfections, where a \u201cdominant virus\u201d was typically identified) than the conventional methods, virus culture and direct fluorescence assay. Similarly, in immunocompetent paediatric patients HRV infection was most closely associated with LRTI in the absence of other viral agents when the viral load was >106 RNA copies/mL.46 Two previous reports could not identify a link between HRV load and respiratory symptoms in children.47, 48 HRV probably causes asymptomatic infections more often than is generally assumed.15\n",

The measures to improve the performance of PCR assays include stringent precautions to avoid contaminations, e.g. using filtered tips, separate rooms and laminar flow hoods, high-standard nucleic acid preparations kits, internal positive controls and numerous negative controls. Inadequate reporting of experimental details regarding qPCR can still impede our ability to evaluate critically the results of scientific papers and the reliability of the specific reported qPCR method.

Since acute symptomatic respiratory illness is often accompanied by multiple virus detections in one sample, it may be difficult to prove, against the Koch postulates, that the mere presence of a pathogen would imply that it is the causative agent of the current illness.5, 14 There is a clear need to move towards quantitative multiplex diagnostics.21, 80, 81 qPCR allows better evaluation of the time course of the infection and of therapy monitoring than end-point PCR. The prevalence of causative viruses exhibits not only seasonal variation, but also considerable year-to-year variation (virus epidemics). The results of a large Swedish study (7853 samples obtained during 36 consecutive months) arrived at a recommendation of using a similar test panel all year round.81 The routine test panel may, however, need to be redesigned or supplemented by qPCRs, depending on the specific epidemiologic situations to increase sensitivity and enable quantification. Overall, it seems that a high viral load is linked with illness severity and LRTI. Quantitative multiplex PCR may provide an estimate of which viruses are active at the moment and which are emerging or on their retreat. Upper respiratory samples seem to be adequate for clinical routine. Matters that still need elucidation are defining cutoff levels for acute virus infections and standardization of sampling, i.e. how to take comparable respiratory samples over time and interindividually for qPCR.63, 82 When used together, qPCR and serologic assays provide a more complete picture of respiratory viral infections, especially HBoV1.56\n",

Clinically, multiplex quantitative PCR is currently the most attractive option since it is cost-effective and the result can be read within hours after sample collection. Because some sensitivity is inevitably lost when multiple primer sequences are included, primers may need redesigning, or multiplex PCR may need to be supplemented by singleplex PCRs, depending on the epidemiological or clinical context. Since multiple viral infections are not uncommon, qPCR may give information on the most active, incipient or weaning infections. Combining qPCR and serologic assays provides a more complete picture of respiratory viral infections.",

In a DNA-free reaction-preparation room, water, buffer, nucleotides, primers, probe and a heat-stabile polymerase enzyme are mixed and aliquoted in reaction tubes, which are taken to the sample room. 3. Purified sample DNA or RNA, standard dilutions, and controls are added to separate reaction tubes, which are then applied to the PCR instrument in a separate amplification room. 4. During PCR the carefully designed specific oligonucleotide primers (in red) are annealed to their complementary regions of the two heat-denatured single-stranded DNA molecules. Progeny strands are synthesized by extension of the primers along the full template strand by the action of the DNA polymerase. This is repeated in 30-45 temperature cycles causing an exponential amplification of the target DNA sequence. At each cycle, the target-specific fluorescent probe (in blue) is hybridized to the increasing amount of targets during which fluorescence is measured. 5. This increase in fluorescence is shown in real time on the screen. The fluorescence curves of the samples are analyzed by the computer and compared with those of the known standard, and the quantity of DNA is calculated.
