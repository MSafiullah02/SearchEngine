Autophagy is characterized by the formation of autophagosomes and the degradation of intracellular organelles and materials within autophagosomes fused with lysosomes. The process occurs at a basal level and in response to stress, such as serum starvation, radiation, or pharmacological agents [10]. The pathophysiological significance of autophagy developed in macrophages remains controversial [11]. The role of autophagy in cell survival remains inconclusive. For example, cells undergoing starvation stress may process autophagy as a pro-survival event. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy may cause an anti-survival manner of autophagy.",

Subsequently, CD14+ cells were purified by high-gradient magnetic sorting using the miniMACS system with anti-CD14 microbeads. The purity of isolated CD14+ monocytes was more than 90% according to flow cytometric analysis. Macrophages were generated from CD14+ monocytes by culture in an RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal-calf serum every 3 days for 6 days in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Various concentrations of sorafenib (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were added at the beginning of the CD14+ cell cultures to evaluate the effects on macrophages. In some experiments, macrophages were activated by adding LPS (100 \u03bcg/mL) for a further 24 h. In each experiment, an equal amount of DMSO was added as a vehicle control.",

By using acridine orange staining, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) in macrophages was demonstrated (Fig. 3\n). Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is the corresponding mammalian homologue of yeast autophagy protein Atg8, which aggregates to autophagosome membranes when autophagy occurs. Western blotting showed an increase in the conversion of free cytosolic LC3B (LC3B-I) to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3B (LC3B-II) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4\n). The increase of LC3 I lipidation persisted to at least day 7. Taken together, they suggest that sorafenib could induce autophagy in human macrophages.",

The development of autophagy could recognize and restrict viral, bacterial, and parasitic infection inside macrophages [12], [13], [14]. By contrast, some viruses have the capability to subvert autophagy to survive, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [15]. Thus, the role and function of autophagy in macrophages remain controversial and need to be clarified. It implies that pharmacological manipulation of macrophages by inducing autophagy might have the potential to benefit the disease outcome of clinical immunological disorders. However, the phenomenon of autophagy induction and the candidate agents to induce autophagy in macrophages have not been reported. In our preliminary study, sorafenib could induce autophagy in both macrophages and dendritic cells (data not shown), indicating a potential role modulating innate immunity. Furthermore, the sorafenib-induced autophagy in human macrophages could be categorized as autophagy-associated cell death.",
