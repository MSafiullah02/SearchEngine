            "text": "Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) represent the largest family of proteins in humans (~ 620) [1], and largely determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitin transfer to target proteins. De-ubiquitylase enzymes (DUBs), in contrast, remove ubiquitin from proteins to recycle ubiquitin and facilitate proteasomal degradation of substrates, to modify the nature of the linkage (editing), to terminate the signal, and/or to attenuate proteasomal degradation [2]. Ubiquitin itself is found singly on proteins as well as in chains of various linkages, a reference to which of seven lysines of ubiquitin are used to join adjacent moieties within a chain. Much remains to be elucidated concerning the biological meaning of the various linkages, but the current paradigm holds that chains linked through lysine-48 of ubiquitin (K48 chains) signal proteasomal degradation and K63-linked chains are signaling events that modify protein location, interaction, and/or function [3].",

            "text": "Of the two activities regulating substrate ubiquitylation, the E3s have garnered the majority of research interest to date. Despite this fact, it is the DUBs that have attracted the most attention for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting. Reasons for this preference include the simplicity of ubiquitin removal relative to conjugation, a process requiring orchestrated action of three enzymes; the lack of functional redundancy among DUBs relative to the E3s (there are only ~ 90 DUBs [4], [5]); and the success of VelcadeTM (Millennium Pharmaceuticals), a proteasome inhibitor that functionally resembles pan-DUB inhibition. Selective DUB inhibition therefore provides an opportunity for therapeutic efficacy, with decreased likelihood of side effects relative to approaches targeting the whole proteasome.",

            "text": "It is well established that E3s are capable of autoubiquitylation [6], [7], [8], [9] and that many DUBs interact directly with E3s [5]. These DUBs antagonize E3 autoubiquitylation and/or substrate ubiquitylation [10] but little attention has been paid to conversation in the opposite direction, E3 activity towards the DUB. A brief survey of proteomic literature revealed that many DUBs have themselves been putatively identified as being ubiquitylated [11], [12] in addition to a handful that have been definitively demonstrated as such [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. We therefore took advantage of a DUB protein microarray to investigate the extent of DUB ubiquitylation, and here report that the vast majority of these proteins can be ubiquitylated in vitro. Furthermore, through the use of DUB-specific antibodies and polyubiquitin specific tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs; [20]), we demonstrate that monoubiquitylation is the predominant form of modification even in vitro among these enzymes. Finally, given the ability of E3s to ubiquitylate themselves, we investigated whether or not the DUBs could remove or prevent their own modification, and found that most could not. Indeed, most were found incapable of completely deubiquitylating other DUBs as well. Interestingly, several different activity profiles were discovered from among the DUBs examined; profiles revealed by the use of actual substrates with isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chains. Particularly in high throughput, this substrate/chain profiling is impossible via MS or alternative biochemical means (e.g., ubiquitin rhodamine or free chains). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of microarray proteomics towards the investigation of substrates for enzymes that remove post translational modifications (PTMs); we believe the technique will also prove informative to the study of other reversible PTMs (phosphorylation for example).",

            "text": "We tested various E3s for the ability to ubiquitylate a microarray of immobilized DUBs previously developed and described (DUB Chip) [21], [24]. This protein microarray consisted of approximately 40 DUB and ubiquitin-like isopeptidases and enabled us to investigate various conditions under which some of them might be ubiquitylated. Multiple identical arrays were incubated with solution containing E1, E2, ubiquitin, and ATP. Ubiquitylation reactions were initiated by the addition of various E3s into duplicate arrays, individually or in combination (rows as listed in Fig. 1A). All arrays were then thoroughly washed to remove soluble reaction components. Finally, within each experimental condition tested, one of the two identically ubiquitylated arrays was visualized using either an antibody towards ubiquitin (FK2) as the primary detection reagent, or biotinylated tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs). While the antibody recognizes ubiquitin conjugated to substrate individually (monoubiquitylation) as well as in chains (polyubiquitylation), TUBEs are specific to detection of polyubiquitylation events [20] without preference to specific chain linkage [25]. The absence of signal from reactions lacking E3 demonstrated that observed signals were ubiquitylation dependent (bottom row, Fig. 1A). Each of the E3s shown in Fig. 1A was capable of ubiquitylating a distinct but overlapping subset of immobilized DUBs (rows 1\u20135 left column) and appeared to work additively when co-incubated (row 6); interestingly, Praja1 was the only E3 tested that exhibited an ability to polyubiquitylate these substrates (rows 1\u20135, compare left and right columns). On the other hand, all of these E3s were capable of forming polyubiquitin chains in concert with UBE2D3 in the E3Lite autoubiquitylation assay (Fig. 1B). A summary of all recombinant E3/immobilized substrate ubiquitylation events is shown in Fig. 1C. Together, these results show that 1) the vast majority of DUBs were ubiquitylated in vitro, 2) most E3s tested were capable of effecting this modification, 3) the events appeared to be predominantly monoubiquitylation, and 4) the substrates themselves influenced the extent of ubiquitylation (i.e. mono- versus poly-) in an E3 dependent manner.",

To maximize ubiquitylation events on the array, we utilized a cocktail of E3s (Murf1, Carp2, Praja1). After 1 h, soluble ubiquitylation reaction components were removed from the arrays which were then thoroughly washed before soluble DUBs were applied to the ubiquitylated array (as listed Figs. 2A,C) and incubated for another hour. Washed and dried arrays were then visualized for total ubiquitylation (mono- and poly-; Fig. 2A) or polyubiquitylation events (Fig. 2C), as above. Loss of signal between an array incubated with DUB compared to one mock treated would indicate putative substrates of that DUB. Complete array data for every combination of immobilized substrate and soluble enzyme is presented as Figs. 2B,D. Results indicated that the vast majority of these DUBs were unable to cleave ubiquitin from the immobilized substrates. To verify that the enzymes were enzymatically competent, they were assayed using the CHOP reporter system (LifeSensors, Inc., Fig. 3A). All enzymes tested displayed activity by this assay, save AMSH. Since this DUB is known to prefer K63 linked chains, we incubated it with a K63 linked internally quenched fluorescence based di-ubiquitin substrate (LifeSensors, Inc.). As shown in Fig. 3B, the enzyme displayed robust activity against this substrate, demonstrating that defining activity varies by assay. With this point in mind, we also tested each of the DUBs for their ability to reverse polyubiquitylation signals in the E3Lite assay, which captures and reports autoubiquitylated E3s. As seen in Fig. 3C, utilizing the E3 mix resulted in signal 40-fold higher than the reaction mix lacking an E3. With the possible exceptions of JOSD1, JOSD2, and K63 specific AMSH [26], [27], all DUBs tested demonstrated activity for shortening or removing E3-linked polyubiquitin chains by appreciably reversing the assay signal, including even K48 specific UCHL5 [26]. Importantly, many DUBs were capable of complete signal reversal (USP2c, USP7, USP8c, USP15, USP21c, USP28, PLP2; and 87% reversal for PLPro).",

USP28 displayed little selectivity towards shortening substrate-bound chains (aside from its inability to act on Ataxin3-like), but was incapable of complete substrate deubiquitylation for any of the substrates examined (Figs. 4, S2).

Alternatively, the observed polyubiquitylation seen in solution might represent enhanced E3 autoubiquitylation activity. To differentiate E3 and DUB ubiquitylation, we used antibodies against UCHL5 and JOSD1 to visualize solution-based in vitro ubiquitylation reactions. UCHL5 has been implicated by MS-based proteomics as being ubiquitylated, but this has not been independently validated [11]. JOSD1 has never been reported to be ubiquitylated. As shown in Fig. 5 both UCHL5 (Fig. 5B) and JOSD1 (Fig. 5C) were exclusively mono-ubiquitylated in vitro. To further distinguish these possibilities (i.e., E3 auto-ubiquitylation and DUB ubiquitylation), Murf2 (shown by array to monoubiquitylate DUBs) was included in ubiquitylation reactions with UCHL5 (shown by array to be ubiquitylated by Murf2). As seen in Fig. 5D (lane 2), and in agreement with Fig. 5A, a high molecular weight smear was observed when all reaction components were soluble. However, prior immobilization of the E3 to the wells of the plate abrogated the appearance of these high molecular weight proteins from the remaining solution-based components and resulted in a single distinct band consistent in size with monoubiquitylated UCHL5 (Fig. 5D lane 3).",

Following 1 hour incubation with lysate, arrays were thoroughly washed, then probed for ubiquitin (either FK2 or TUBEs for observing mono- and poly\u2010events, respectively). As shown in Fig. 6A, the lysate was capable of ubiquitylating immobilized DUBs in a manner consistent with monoubiquitylation. Because the lysate presumably contained various E3s and DUBs, the observed monoubiquitylation might have reflected either deposition of a single ubiquitin or the net effect of DUBs attenuating initially assembled chains. New arrays were therefore treated with HEK293T lysate that had been made in the presence of the pan-DUB inhibitor PR619 (LifeSensors, Inc.) to antagonize DUB activity (e.g., chain shortening). Results were indistinguishable from the untreated lysate (data not shown). This suggested that, consistent with our earlier data (Fig. 1A), DUB monoubiquitylation is a product of single-moiety deposition as opposed to chain shortening. A summary of lysate driven ubiquitylation for each of the proteins on the array is shown as Fig. 6B.",

Five of these twelve (Bap1, Otub1, UCHL3, UCHL5, USP14) were initially identified as ubiquitylated in HeLa cells via MS proteomics [11] but never independently confirmed. This study, therefore, represents their first in vitro confirmation as targets of ubiquitylation and suggests putative E3s. Of the 39 substrates examined on the array, the only ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteases not ubiquitylated by recombinant E3 mix were SENP1c, SENP6c, and JOSD2. One of these, SENP6c, was ubiquitylated by the lysate, suggesting that our mix lacked an appropriate E3 for this target. UCHL1 was not ubiquitylated by the lysate, despite having been when recombinant E3s were used. This suggests that either the observed in vitro ubiquitylation was artifactual, the lysate used did not contain an appropriate ligase for this substrate, or the lysate contained an UCHL1-specific DUB. Otherwise, the recombinant mix of E3s and the lysate were surprisingly consistent in terms of which substrates were ubiquitylated.",

False positives are also inherent to proteomic investigation. In the case of MS-based studies, false positives usually represent indirect effects (for example, proteins identified as hyper-ubiquitylated following DUB mutation/deletion might be substrates for an E3, the inhibitor of which was increasingly degraded by the loss of DUB activity). Array-based proteomics definitively demonstrate direct-effects, but cannot inform as to biological relevance; false positives in this setting generally reflect two proteins capable of interaction that otherwise never do so in cells. However configured, proteomics provides the leads but verification is always required to sort the wheat from the chaff. Cross-complementary strengths and weaknesses make MS and array-based proteomics reciprocal, and suggest a rapid and high-throughput workflow. Namely, performing both types of experiments for the same protein(s) of interest and cross referencing resultant data sets for common hits would identify directly interacting proteins whose interaction occurs in vivo. A slightly modified example of such an approach is the current in vitro verification of in vivo results for Bap1, Otub1, UCHL3, UCHL5, and USP14, previously suggested by MS to be ubiquitylated.",

Such experiments do not well reflect DUB physiology, since most DUBs do not exist in cells to recognize and cleave free chains (IsoT excepted [29]). The importance of looking at actual substrates with isopeptide-linked chains demonstrated here (Figs. 5, and Supplemental Fig. 1, Supplemental Fig. 2, Supplemental Fig. 3, Supplemental Fig. 4, Supplemental Fig. 5) is intuitively underscored by noting the presence in human (and most eukaryotes) of more DUBs (~ ninety) than unique chain topologies (eight).

Simple procedural modifications, like utilizing different E2/E3 combinations, or using single-lysine ubiquitin mutants to drive homogeneous chain formation further expand the information potential. Even the current study, which utilized a small array of a single family of enzymes, a single E2 (UBE2D3) reported to form both K11 and K48 linked chains [30], and wild-type ubiquitin, revealed an unexpectedly large breadth of insight into biology of the pathway represented.",

We showed that most E3s tested are capable of effecting this modification for a distinct but overlapping set of substrates. Because most E3s transferred only a single ubiquitin (Figs. 1A, 5B\u2013D, 6A, and 7) despite being shown capable of auto-polyubiquitylation, we know that there was only one acceptor lysine per DUB; this highlights the degree of specificity maintained in vitro considering that, for example, JOSD1 has 15 lysines and UCHL5 has 25. Because we identified an E3 capable of DUB polyubiquitylation (Praja 1, Fig. 1A), we know that even in vitro, the substrate is capable of influencing the extent to which the modification occurs in an E3-dependent manner. The fact that cell lysates also monoubiquitylated these substrates suggests that the mono-events observed here have biological relevance. We demonstrated that E3s appear hyperactivated for autoubiquitylation in the presence of most DUBs (Fig. 5). This effect could be mediated by conformational change occurring after deposition of ubiquitin to substrate, or through simple interaction with the DUB. Because USP33c and DEN1 were not ubiquitylated in vitro by Murf1 (Fig. 1C column 3, rows 17 and 22, respectively) but mediated this E3-hyperactivation under similar conditions (Fig. 5A), we have limited evidence to support the latter model. Because ubiquitin itself was present as a substrate on the array, we learned that most E3s here tested do not generate free chains in vitro, but Praja1 does (Fig. 1A compare TUBEs to FK2 detection). We demonstrated that most DUBs do not auto-deubiquitylate; nor, in fact, do most act to completely deubiquitylate any other DUBs. By visualizing both poly- and mono-ubiquitin on substrates we were able to observe several characteristic activity behaviors from among the DUBs; behaviors not apparent in studies with free chains considering that all DUBs tested cleaved free chains (loss of signal in Fig. 4 rows 1, TUBEs detection, or Supplemental Fig. 1, Supplemental Fig. 2, Supplemental Fig. 3, Supplemental Fig. 4, Supplemental Fig. 5 rows 30 TUBEs detection). Namely, we have demonstrated that some DUBs cleave chains promiscuously (USP28); some cleave chains with substrate specificity (USP15); some are selective by substrate and cleave \u201call or nothing\u201d (USP21c) consistent with a model in which the DUB removes chains in toto but only from certain substrates; and finally, some DUBs promiscuously cleave chains, but show selectivity in the removal of the final mono-UB (PLPro and PLP2). Interestingly, some of these profiles have been proposed based on structural prediction of differential interaction among DUB, substrate, and ubiquitin [31].",

The most well-studied consequence to DUB ubiquitylation is the hyperactivation of Ataxin3 activity [19]. Preliminary experiments aimed at exploring this possibility for other selected enzymes suggested that this was not, in fact, a functional consequence shared by other DUBs (data not shown). Nothing has yet been attempted to address the second question, but it is worth noting that a ubiquitylated membrane receptor has been reported to be substrate of USP4 (itself the putative substrate of PLPro) [32]; and manipulation of host receptors seems a likely target for invading microorganisms that require endocytosis (and lysosomal avoidance) for infection.",

Ubiquitylation reactions with Murf1 (shown by array to monoubiquitylate DUB substrates) as the E3 were run in the presence of various DUBs. Reactions were SDS PAGE separated, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with TUBEs to observe any high molecular weight polyubiquitylation. Most reactions with DUBs displayed enhanced smearing characteristic of polyubiquitylation, compared to the reaction containing no DUB (first lane). B. Antibody to UCHL5 was used to probe separated reaction components from complete ubiquitylation reactions including Praja1 as the E3 (shown by array to be capable of DUB polyubiquitylation) and UCHL5 as substrate (column labeled (+)). Inclusion of all components except Praja1 (column labeled \u201c-E3\u201d) showed that the observed 8 kD shift (indicated by arrow) above the predominant form of the substrate was ubiquitylation dependent. Similarity of this lane to one containing only UCHL5 protein substrate (column labeled \u201cPr\u201d) confirms that the antibody was not cross reacting to any ubiquitylation machinery (e.g., ubiquitin or charged E2). C. Identical to Fig. 5B except that blot was visualized with anti-JOSD1 antibody, and JOSD1 was the substrate included in the reactions (or protein alone lane). D.
