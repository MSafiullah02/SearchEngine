Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century which caused huge losses worldwide. According to historical estimations, in 1918 the Spanish Influenza (H1N1) may have resulted in roughly 20\u201340 million deaths worldwide.1 It was so deadly that some scholars view it as one of the deadliest events in human history. The Asian Influenza (H2N2) in 1958 claimed about two million lives and the Hong Kong Influenza (H3N2) in 1968 caused an estimated one million deaths.\n",

Global pandemic activity had remained low over the past few months, and there was little evidence of higher pandemic influenza activity than what was normally caused by the seasonal influenza.

While developed countries already had fairly effective response measures in place thanks to their advanced economic and social development as well as robust healthcare systems, some developing countries with poor economic foundations and weak public healthcare had a much harder time dealing with public emergencies. Therefore, they had an even harder time in dealing with Influenza A (H1N1). After the pandemic broke out, countries showed varied responses to the WHO\u2019s recommended response strategies and measures; in particular developing countries that had greater reliance on these strategies and measures as well as technical assistance from the WHO, were much more proactive. There is no doubt that the WHO played a crucial role in helping countries worldwide\u2014especially developing ones\u2014in coping with the pandemic, whether it is pandemic monitoring, clinical diagnosis and treatment of the virus, or vaccine development and distribution. However, because this pandemic originated in North American countries, taking into account the political, economic and cultural differences between countries as well as their different response capabilities, the WHO was also faced with new challenges like how to provide tailored guidance to developed and developing countries. The purpose of this guidance was to increase the effectiveness of related strategies and measures, mitigate and contain the spread of the pandemic, and minimize the negative effects of the virus on society and populations. Such targeted guidance was not particularly prevalent in their guidance regarding response strategies and measures as the requirements placed on developed countries were quite low, resulting in an overall devaluation of said proposed strategies and measures. Therefore, when confronting similar public health emergencies in the future, the WHO should present more pertinent strategies and tailored measures which could play greater roles in pandemic preparation and response.",

After its incorporation in 2003 into the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA\u2019s) responsibilities were expanded from natural disaster response to counter terrorism and pandemic diseases. The FEMA Director, appointed by the President, reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security and may, in response to a crisis, be summoned by the President to attend ministerial-level meetings and take part in the decision-making process. After the influenza pandemic outbreak in 2009, the United States launched its standard emergency response procedures, which included close collaboration and coordination among the federal, state and local governments along with the private sector. The U.S. Congress was charged mainly with funding public health efforts at the federal, state, and local levels,25 while it was the responsibility of the federal government to update response plans, strengthen the development and revision of community-based plans, and enhance response capabilities. The DHS oversaw the distribution of antiviral medications and the dissemination of pandemic information to the public.26 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the executive body of pandemic preparation and response, was in charge of deploying, directing, and overseeing various response efforts, and they also completed the following: issued guidance on the influenza pandemic,27 provided technical, financial, and medical support to states, and based on pandemic analysis announced a national state of emergency. As the national public health institute under the HHS, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) played a crucial role in virus monitoring, prevention, and control. Similarly, Australia established a mechanism in which an inter-agency committee under the leadership of the prime minister and the cabinet was in charge of determining the federal government\u2019s preparation and response strategies as well as pandemic countermeasures,28 with state governments making and implementing relevant policies under the guidance of the federal government.",

The CDC and the DHS provided specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, seniors, health care workers, workers in relevant industries, laboratory workers, and homeless people. With these recommendations, people were equipped to take appropriate action in reducing the transmission of the virus, especially in early autumn before vaccines were widely disseminated. The CDC also provided, and updated on a regular basis, scientific guidance on influenza prevention and control to schools, daycares, universities, large and small businesses, and federal agencies. These comprehensive guidelines provided not only advice on how individuals and institutions could protect themselves against the virus and mitigate its spread, but also recommendations for healthcare providers about the appropriate use of anti-viral drugs, especially in treating patients who were at the highest risk of suffering complications from the influenza.47, 48\n",

Immediately following the outbreak, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) subordinate to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) began its research on the virus and vaccination development. In July 2009, the NIAID initiated a series of clinical trials on the effectiveness of newly developed vaccines. In September, the FDA approved manufacturing for four vaccination types, which were then made available for distribution among the states. The federal government then identified priority groups for vaccination and formulated an inoculation policy.51 Starting on October 5th, a national Influenza A (H1N1) voluntary inoculation program begun targeting high-priority groups including pregnant women; people between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; people aged 65 years or older with chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes and heart disease; and healthcare and emergency services personnel.52 During the two months that followed, vaccine manufacturers provided 10\u201320 million vaccination doses each week, an amount which reached roughly 250 million by the end of 2009.53, 54 According to statistics, the federal government ordered a total of 229 million doses of the vaccine with the plans of vaccinating 158 million people, and in the end 90 million people were actually inoculated.",

A highly controversial event also occurred during vaccination distribution: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene decided to give the small amount of vaccine available in the early phases of the pandemic to big corporations on Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs and Citibank, an act which experts believe only exacerbated public relation issues. Vaccine production and distribution became a controversial focal point during prevention and control of the pandemic as it involved multi-faceted issues such as vaccine patents, mass psychology, and social justice.",
