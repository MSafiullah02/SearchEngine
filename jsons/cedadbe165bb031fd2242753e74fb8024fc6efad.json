Among the broad aims under this overarching aim, understanding NOS and STS continue to be spelt out explicitly, namely, Students should be able to -appreciate and understand the nature of science in science-related contexts -make informed decisions and judgments on science-related issues -be aware of the social, ethical, economic, environmental and technological implications of science, and develop an attitude of responsible citizenship These new emphases are particularly important when more and more social issues in our daily lives demand a populace which is scientifically literate in following new developments in science and scientific debates.",

Similar limitations have also been found among the Hong Kong science teachers, in a recent study on teachers' understanding of STS and beliefs about its implementation (Wong, 2004) .

This sets the 'purpose' for the reading. As most of the students can easily be misguided by the newspaper report -this was confirmed in our pilot study -the teacher will then provide some guidelines for them to rethink and discuss the issue (coaching) in groups (collaboration). The guiding questions include what the differences between the properties of hydrogen peroxide and industrial hydrogen peroxide are, and how these two substances can affect the body. Also, students will be asked to think about the usual way in which shark fin is cooked. It is hoped that these guiding questions can help students to relate the effect of washing and prolonged cooking on shark fin and its residual hydrogen peroxide, and hence reach the conclusion that, in contrast to some of the newspaper reports, using hydrogen peroxide itself does no harm to the body. Rather, it is the impurities in industrial hydrogen peroxide that can cause harm.

            "text": "Professor Lee Kwing-chin of The School of Pharmacy, CUHK indicated that diluted hydrogen peroxide bleach is not very harmful to humans. However the concentration of industrial grade hydrogen peroxide is so high that it may damage the digestive system. Also, prolonged absorption or massive absorption could cause ulcer. He said that medical literature has indicated an association between hydrogen peroxide and cancer. Legislator Lo Wing-lok, who represents the medical constituency, said boiled bleaching solution would do no serious harm to the human body, but industrial grade hydrogen peroxide would affect our health. Dr Lo explained that industrial grade peroxide demands a low purity and may be mixed with other substances like organic and inorganic toxins, heavy metals like lead and biotoxins like arsenic. If they were absorbed into the shark's fin, they could cause various problems. ",

            "text": "Throughout the development of the teaching resources, we sought comments and feedback from teachers who participated in our training workshops and in particular teachers who tried out the activities in their own classrooms. The final form of the each activity has been revised many times based on the exchange with these enthusiastic teachers who are keen to contribute towards the development of the teaching resources for students to learn about NOS and STS. We concur with the view of Derek Hodson (Hodson, 2006) that \"curriculum materials need to have a 'street credibility' that can only be gained when they are developed by teachers for teachers.\" (p. 305). The instructional packages and the classroom practices have been disseminated to all secondary schools in Hong Kong in the form of CD-ROMs. The instructional packages are also available in the website http://learningscience. edu.hku.hk/. We believe that we have demonstrated in the teaching packages, the principles of how NOS and STSE could be integrated smoothly into the teaching of subject content knowledge. The classroom implementations of these teaching resources have demonstrated that students have the ability to learn the concepts of NOS and STSE and that they have enjoyed the various non-traditional classroom activities. We have found no evidence that the learning of the subject knowledge intended in the packages has been compromised. We hope that teachers will be encouraged by these findings and position themselves to take on the new initiatives in teaching about NOS and STSE. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The project reported in this article was supported by the Quality Education Fund 2004-05 (2004/0819). The authors are grateful to the participating teachers who kindly agreed to take part in the project. The project is funded by the Quality Education Fund of the Hong Kong SAR Government which finances worthwhile projects for the promotion of quality education in Hong Kong. 2 The slides are modified from the picture http://timepass1.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/lake-in-burmapraying-mountain-another-hoax",
