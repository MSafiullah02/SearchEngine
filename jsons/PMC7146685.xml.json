The trolley was divided into 3 layers. The first layer was a box with a cover, which was used to load the entire box of critical care drugs, and the back of the box cover was designed with a separate bag for loading scattered drugs. The second and third layers were designed with a left drawer and a right cabinet with a door. The drawer was for placing syringes and other consumables, and the cabinet was for placing large infusions. The entire body of the critical care trolley was made of stainless steel with a pulley and handle design, making it convenient for emergency movement. Once a patient developed a critical condition such as shock, respiratory failure, heart failure, etc., the medical staff visited the patient with the critical care drug trolley to immediately administer the critical care medicine.

Therefore, the combined use of Chinese and Western medicine, the use of multiple Chinese patent drugs, or the combined use of Chinese patent drugs and Chinese herbal decoctions was common. Most of the doctors participating in the diagnosis and treatment in the module hospital were Western medicine doctors; hence, it may be necessary for the pharmacists of the clinical pharmaceutical care group to actively participate in evaluating drug compatibility, interactions, and adverse reactions to ensure the safety of the patients.
