Due to this precaution, under the circumstances that not many clinicians at the time recognized or expected the emergence of COVID-19 cases from the community, we were able to serve initial medical care without unexpected exposure. In addition, some COVID-19 patients in China are also treated with ECMO [2e4,6]. As of writing, it is challenging and could be premature to discuss the exact candidate of ECMO for COVID-19 patients in this phase of an outbreak, where the systematic collection of data is non-existent [9] . Since admission of our case, our most likely diagnosis was viral pneumonia, which we recognized as a reversible condition. When the respiratory condition deteriorated on hospital day 2, he did not suffer from multi-organ failure except for sole respiratory failure with Murray Score of 4, which we thought fulfilled the main indication of ECMO. These patient characteristics and presumptive conditions are likely to have been the important factors that benefited ECMO use and resulted in a favorable outcome. Other interventions such as prone positioning [6] could have been one of the choices for severe respiratory failure before initiating ECMO.
