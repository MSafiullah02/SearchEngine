            "text": "Oxidative stress develops when the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a system exceeds the system's ability to neutralize and eliminate them. The imbalance can result either from a lack of antioxidant capacity caused by disturbance in production, distribution, or by an over-abundance of ROS from an environmental or behavioral stressor (Boelsterli, 2003). ROS could be produced by several agents and stressors such as heat stress, diseases, proinflammatory cytokines, and toxins. If not regulated properly, the excess ROS can impair the cell's lipids, protein, or DNA, inhibiting its normal functions (Gupta et al., 2012). DNA damage, malondialdehyde (MDA), proteins carbonyl are examples of molecules that can be modified by excessive ROS in vivo and could be used as important and significant biomarkers of oxidative stress (Ho et al., 2013). Furthermore, oxidative stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), resulting in the release of glucocorticoids (Colaianna et al., 2013). High levels of corticosterone induce poor performance (Virden et al., 2007) and depression of the innate immune system (Yang et al., 2015). It was found that induced-oxidative stress in broiler chickens leads to proteolysis and gluconeogenesis (Lin et al., 2004), several pathologies incidence (Fellenberg and Speisky, 2006), DNA damage (Huang et al., 2015), and depression of immune function and growth performance with a high mortality rate (Kamel et al., 2017; Mehaisen et al., 2017). Depending on the severity of the oxidative harm, the consequence of these modulations can vary from modifying cell function to cell death, which negatively affects poultry flocks.",

            "text": "Paraquat (PQ; 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridium dichloride) is widely used in agriculture as a non-selective contact herbicide with redox activity. PQ is known to exert its toxic effects via oxidative stress mechanisms (Ray et al., 2007). The potential mechanism of PQ toxicity is the cyclic single-electron redox reaction that depletes cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and generates superoxide anion. Superoxide ions may form hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals; the latter being an extremely potent oxidant that may damage nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides (Tukmechi et al., 2013). Moreover, trace amounts of PQ can be detected in more than 100 crops such as corn, tomatoes, olives, field beans, and fruits (Prasad et al., 2009). PQ effects in rodent models showed that prolonged exposure leads to accumulation and persistent damage in the brain, lung, and liver tissues (Ortiz et al., 2016). A study on paraquat toxicity in turkeys reported that all injected birds were affected at the dose of 6.25 mg/kg BW while the lethal dose was about 20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg by intravenous and intraperitoneal injection, respectively (Smalley, 1973).",

Flavonoid and phenolic compounds in propolis have been appeared to be capable of scavenging free radicals and thereby defending lipids and other compounds from being oxidized or destroyed during oxidative damage (Seven et al., 2009). In addition, propolis is thought to be responsible for many biological and pharmacological activities including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, hepato-protective, and immuno-stimulating activities (Ha\u0161\u010d\u00edk et al., 2015). Many previous reports indicated that the inclusion of propolis in the poultry diet has a positive effect on the humoral immunity of laying hens (Cetin et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2011), on the hatchability and performance of quail chicks (Aygun et al., 2012), and on the hemoglobin concentrations and eosinophil count of blue-fronted parrots (Silva et al., 2014).",

On the other hand, much research is focused on the ability of propolis to improve production performance, enhance immune function, and inhibit inflammatory response, which is very critical for poultry industry. However, it is not clear whether propolis supplementation could also reverse the inflammatory status and the negative effects of oxidative stress induced by paraquat treatment. Thus, the current study was designed to investigate the effects of propolis supplementation on controlling the oxidative stress induced by paraquat injection to turkeys. The oxidative stress was determined as the level of MDA, which is an important and significant biomarker of oxidative stress, in the blood. In addition, the inflammation status and immune function were evaluated in turkey poults after propolis supplementation with or without paraquat injection. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation test and stressed-related protein expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were analyzed in the blood. In addition, growth performance of turkey birds was obtained under propolis supplementation in order to test whether it has the ability to reverse the negative effects of oxidative stress induced by paraquat.",

The second group received the control diet and a single subcutaneously injected of paraquat (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 5 mg/kg body weight, per day for 7 consecutive days (PQ group). The third group received the experimental diet containing propolis and a daily subcutaneous injection of paraquat for a period of 7 days (PR+PQ group). The fourth group received the experimental propolis diet and a daily subcutaneous injection of saline for a period of 7 days (PR group). At 56 d of age, blood samples were collected from the brachial vein of the birds in each treatment using heparinized syringes and the physiological parameters were assayed (2 samples from each pen for each parameter; n = 6), including the MDA and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from blood, as well as the corticosterone and triiodothyronine (T3) hormone concentration in the plasma. The immune function of turkey poults in each group was determined by analyzing total white blood cells (WBCs), heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, toe web swelling in response to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P) injection as an indicator for the cell-mediated immunity, antibody response to sheep red blood cells (Anti-SRBCs Ab) injection as an indicator of the humoral-mediated immunity, and the stimulation index of peripheral T-lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the DNA fragmentation and blotting expression of Hsp70 were analyzed in PBMCs isolated from blood samples in each group.

            "text": "Paraquat is widely used as an herbicide in agriculture and may cause chronic health problems to animals and humans if it is absorbed through the skin or gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Ortiz et al., 2016). The deleterious effects of PQ are mainly attributed to the extreme redox activity that, in turn, induces extensive damage for several organs and tissues, leading to high mortality rates in human (Lin et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2013) and animal populations (Ray et al., 2007; Tukmechi et al., 2013). On the contrary, propolis, due to its antioxidation and anti-inflammation properties, has been recently used in poultry feeds as an alternative and practical way to alleviate deleterious effects of rearing under abnormal and stress conditions (Seven et al., 2009, 2010). So far, the research regarding PQ and PR effects on growth performance and immune function in animal science is very limited and the available discussion remains insufficient to understand such effects.",

            "text": "In the present study, it was found that PQ significantly suppressed weight gain and feed intake, and impaired feed conversion ratio by 60%, 46%, and 39%, respectively, compared to the control poults. A similar low growth performance was obtained by feeding paraquat to fish (Babatunde and Oladimeji, 2014) or rats (Kimura et al., 1999). The low performance after paraquat treatment is attributed to the oxidative stress that may have been due to active oxygen species formed by the action of paraquat. Previous reports attributed the low performance in oxidative stressed-broilers to the reduction in associated metabolic and endocrine responses (Lin et al., 2004) or the down-regulation of all sugar, peptide, and amino acid transporter genes in the small intestine (Ebrahimi et al., 2015). On the other hand, dietary propolis ameliorated the suppression of weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion in turkey poults that were exposed to PQ injection. Furthermore, administration of propolis to the diets of the turkey poults without PQ stress enhanced the weight gain by 20% compared to the control poults. This enhancement may probably be due to the ability of propolis to improve nutrients digestibility and absorption as a result of improving saccharase, amylase, and phosphatase activities (Mutsaers et al., 2005). Additionally, Shalmany and Shivazad (2006) reported that the increase in feed intake could be linked to the palatable substances in propolis like resin, wax, honey, and vanillin. Furthermore, Ka\u010d\u00e1niov\u00e1 et al. (2012) found that flavonoids in propolis have antibacterial activity and prevent the ability of pathogenic bacteria to attach to the intestinal epithelium (Parkar et al., 2008); thus improving intestinal health, and consequently, enhance digestion and nutrient absorption (Denli et al., 2005).",

The significant increase in MDA levels upon treatment with PQ in turkey poults indicates the oxidative damages occurred to PBMCs. These results are consistent with the finding that various concentrations of PQ increase the cellular peroxidation (Zhang et al., 2010). When propolis was supplemented to the diets of turkey poults, a reduction in MDA level was obtained in the PR+PQ group compared to the PQ group. Previous studies reported that the supplemental antioxidants extracted from propolis, such as flavonoids and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, block ROS production and protect cell membranes against oxidants (Seven et al., 2010). It was also suggested that polyphenols of propolis can reduce the negative effects of oxidative stress either by chelation of iron or by free radical trapping (Thirugnanasampandan et al., 2012).",

PQ-induced ROS accumulation could promote the production of TNF\u03b1 to trigger the tissue injury; and reversely, increased TNF\u03b1 concentration could promote further ROS generation (Edwards et al., 2004). Results of the present study demonstrate that TNF\u03b1 concentration in the PBMC\u2019s was higher in the PQ and PR+PQ groups compared to the C group. The positive effect of propolis was not statistically significant in this study, however, it is well documented that propolis supplementation may attenuate the adverse effects of environmental stress and stress induced tissue damage by modulating the levels of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 (Fitzpatrick et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2005). In addition to the increase in the TNF\u03b1 concentration in the PBMC\u2019s, PQ injection also induced a significant high plasma corticosterone concentration. This high corticosterone levels probably decreased feed intake and reduced intestinal absorptive surface area as reported by Hu et al. (2010). Furthermore, the release of corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines exerted catabolic effects on proteins and lipids (Siegel, 1995). These findings may be responsible for the lower body weight gain in the PQ poults as previously reported in the present study.",

(1997) reported an increased hypothyroidism in the people intoxicated with paraquat herbicide and found detectable levels of paraquat in their thyroid glands. Goldner et al.

In contrast, the plasma T3 was significantly higher in the PR group than in the C group. The positive effects of propolis on T3/T4 ratio was previously reported in broilers reared under heat stress condition (Amen et al., 2015), reflecting improvement in thyroid hormones secretions and higher conversion rate to the active form of thyroid hormone which is responsible for metabolism.

In PQ group, the H/L ratio was increased, while the total WBCs, the toe web swelling in response to PHA injection, antibody titers to SRBCs, and T-lymphocyte proliferation were significantly decreased compared to the C group. These results are consistent with the data presented by Riahi et al. (2010) who concluded that paraquat administration at high dose (intra-peritoneal injection of 1 mg/kg BW for 21 d) in mice has an inhibitory effect on the cell-mediated and humoral immunity; including higher neutrophil cells number, and lower hemagglutination antibody titer and lymphocyte proliferation. The increase in H/L ratio in the PQ group may be due to the inflammation (Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2008), which was represented by corticosterone and TNF\u03b1 elevation in the same group. In a recent study, Mehaisen et al. (2017) reported that corticosterone treatment has immunosuppressive effect in broiler chickens. In addition, free radicals are known to attack unsaturated fatty acid side chains of phospholipids, causing a substantial decrease of the membrane integrity and fluidity of immune cells (Smith and Heath, 1974). It is possible that free oxygen radicals generated by paraquat could inhibit T cell proliferation via membrane lipids peroxidation (Riahi et al., 2010). In contrast, dietary propolis supplementation enhanced the total WBCs and T-lymphocyte proliferation in the PR group compared to the C group. Not only that, but it also reversed the negative effect of paraquat injection on the immune function in the PR+PQ group. These positive effects of PR and its ability to alleviate the PQ effects on immunity may be due to the stimulation of intracellular antioxidants, which are important in lymphocyte activation and proliferation (Annunziata and Iorio, 2004).",

The paraquat toxicity may be due to the excessive release of ROS which, in turn, initiate lipid peroxidation, particularly in the polyunsaturated lipid compound of cell membranes (Hayes and Laws, 1991). Furthermore, the paraquat toxicity involves depletion of cellular reduction agent of NADPH which is used as a cofactor for lipid and nucleic acid synthesis (Kelner and Bagnell, 1989). These events induced by PQ-oxidative stress may increase the DNA damage at the cellular level (Ribas et al., 1995), and consequently, the DNA fragmentation occurred in the PBMCs lead to the impaired immune function of the turkey poults that were injected with PQ in the current study. On the other hand, Hsp70, which is classified as a constitutive protein synthesized to protect cells from stress (Al-Aqil et al., 2009), was also analyzed in the PBMCs of turkey poults in the present study. The Hsp70 was over blotted in the PQ group compared with the C group. In accordance with our results, previous reports demonstrated higher expressions of Hsp70 in rats (Crum et al., 2015) and mice (Nakanishi and Yasumoto, 1997) that received PQ compound in comparison with the controls. These findings show that PQ administration appeared to activate oxidative degradation in the cell, and consequently, increased the level of oxidized proteins, which stimulate self-defense mechanism of the cell to increase the level of Hsp70.",

Phenolic acids and flavonoids are known as the basic compounds of propolis according to its quality and type (Kurek-G\u00f3recka et al., 2013), and these compounds have a powerful antioxidative activity (G\u00fcl\u00e7in, 2006). It was demonstrated that such compounds inhibit the activity of participated enzymes in the ROS creation such as cAMP phosphodiesterase, protein kinase C, ascorbic acid oxidase, lipoxygenase and Na+/K+ ATPase (Pietta, 2000). Moreover, the antioxidant compounds of propolis decrease the activity of xanthine oxidase, an oxidase of NADPH, which is responsible for the appearance of superoxide anion radical (Harborne and Williams, 2000). In addition, propolis could activate the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, one of the most important antioxidant enzymes (de S\u00e1 et al., 2013). These antioxidative characteristics of propolis may participate in the mechanism of inhibiting the DNA damage and Hsp70 over-expression in PBMCs of turkey treated with PQ, and then finally these birds can express a normal immune function.",

The negative effects of PQ could be justified by the high levels of MDA and TNF\u03b1 in PBMC\u2019s, and the high corticosterone with low T3 concentrations in the plasma. Furthermore, the DNA fragmentation and Hsp70 expression in the PBMCs explain the malfunction of these cells and the low immunity in the PQ-treated poults. In contrast, the dietary propolis supplementation can alleviate the negative effects of PQ-induced oxidative stress on the productive, physiological, and immunological parameters of turkey poults. The positive effects of antioxidative compounds in the propolis can decrease the MDA, TNF\u03b1, corticosterone, DNA fragments, and Hsp70 levels. Therefore, the addition of propolis at a rate of 1 g/kg to the diet of turkey poults could be recommended as a potential nutritional strategy in order to improve their immunity and performance, especially under oxidative stress conditions by herbicides like paraquat.",
