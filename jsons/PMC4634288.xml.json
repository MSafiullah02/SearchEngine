The collected data seem to indicate that ICV can be considered a possible cause of CAP in children, particularly in younger subjects. Our results also suggest the need for further prospective studies that should be carried out throughout the year to provide conclusive results. Previous studies have shown that ICV infection in temperate zones does not have the marked seasonal nature of IAV or IBV infections as it has been in patients with respiratory infections during winter (concomitantly with other influenza viruses) as well as during late spring and early summer.1 It is therefore possible that the global importance of ICV as a cause of CAP in children is greater than that found in our study, which only involved the winter months.",

As the incidence of ICV\u2010associated CAP in the 2 years with positive cases was 1\u00b73% and 2\u00b73%, respectively, it is possible that enrolling fewer than 100 cases of CAP per year could have led to negative results even if ICV was circulating.",

As there are no data concerning the circulation of ICV in Italy during previous or subsequent years, it is not possible to establish which was the dominant genetic lineage, or whether a new dominant group was replacing a previously more important lineage. Data collected in France from 2004 to 200710 and in Spain in 2009\u201320103 indicate that strains belonging to the same lineages as those found in this study were co\u2010circulating there immediately before or simultaneously with those identified in Italy. Moreover, four of the five ICVs identified in this study had 99% nucleotidic identity with strains first identified in France10 and Spain.3 This confirms that spontaneous variations in the amino acid sequences of circulating ICV strains occur slowly and that continuous virological surveillance of ICV may contribute to improving our knowledge of the importance of the different strains in causing disease.",
