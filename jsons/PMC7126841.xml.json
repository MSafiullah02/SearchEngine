Its causative agent, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), belonging to the coronavirus, has a positive single-stranded RNA about 28.6 kb and consists of three major structural proteins: a phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N) and two glycoproteins, the membrane (M) and the spike (S) proteins [1]. The envelope S protein is highly glycosylated and mediates the binding of TGEV to its cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) [2], [3]. As the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, the S protein has been used mainly for the induction of protective immunity to TGEV and four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) have been defined on the amino-terminal domain [4], [5]. Earlier studies have shown that the intact globular N-terminal half of the S protein is sufficient to achieve a protective immune response equivalent to that induced by the full S protein [6].",

            "text": "The TGEV infects the villous enterocytes, which causes localized infections to the intestinal tracts, resulting in villous atrophy and consequently a malabsorptive diarrhea [1]. Protection of the suckling piglets from TGEV infection requires the induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in milk, especially in colostrums. Typically, IgA-producing plasma cells in the mammary gland of pregnant sows originate from the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) where they were activated by different antigenic components [7], [8]. Thus, new developments have focused on the production and delivery of the S protein through oral immunization. Several systems have been used to express the full-length or truncated TGEV S proteins such as Salmonella\n[9], [10], [11], Lactobacillus casei\n[12] and plants [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, the expression level of antigen protein in transgenic plants is generally low and will lose its bioactivity due to the degradation of stomach acid [13], [18]. Prokaryotic expression antigen protein in bacterial will greatly affect its immunogenicity for lacking of glycosylation and post-translational modification [1], [19]. As fore-mentioned, an easy and effective oral vaccine suitable for protecting against TGEV infection is highly needed in livestock farming.",

They are also able to deliver multiple antigens. Oral delivery increases the safety and ease of administration. In addition, bacteria naturally possess immunostimulatory molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that can function as adjuvant to stimulate immune responses [32], furthermore, live bacterial vectors are able to induce systemic immune response, including humoral, cellular and mucosal immunity against pathogen infection [33]. When comparing the three different dosages of DNA vaccine delivered by the attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-S), we found that immunogenicity of the TGEV DNA vaccine was highly dependent on the dosage of the attenuated bacteria used for oral administration. Delivery of the DNA vaccine at a low dosage (107\n CFU) only elicits weak anti-TGEV IgG and IgA antibody through out the experiment. When the vaccination dosage increased to 108\n CFU, the IgG and IgA antibody level was enhanced, meanwhile the highest antibody response was detected at week 6 post-vaccination when the vaccination dosage was increased to 109\n CFU.",

The target gene could be expressed not only in vitro but also in vivo to develop a specific humoral and mucosal immune response against TGEV. Although these data are preliminary and an ultimate TGEV vaccine may require incorporation of other TGEV antigens [34], or together with co-stimulatory molecules or immunomodulatory cytokines [35], the attenuated S. typhimurium may be an adequate delivery system to be tested in further experiments with the DNA vaccine of TGEV to obtain a maximum immune response.",
