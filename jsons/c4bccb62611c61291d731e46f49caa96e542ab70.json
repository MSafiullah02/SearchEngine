Multiple studies suggest that dromedary camels are a source for human MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV-specific antibodies have been detected in the serum of dromedary camels across Northern Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula. Israel's geographic location places Israel at risk for MERS-CoV infection. To date, MERS-CoV-related illness has not been reported and the burden of MERS-CoV infection in the Israeli population is unknown. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in Israeli dromedary camels is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity in dromedary camels in Israel. The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Israeli camels was examined in 71 camel sera collected from four farms across Israel by MERS-CoV-specific microneutralization (Mnt) assay and confirmed by MERS-CoV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Although this study cannot rule out potential antibody cross-reactivity by IFA, the presence of bovine coronavirus-specific antibodies do not appear to impact detection of MERS-CoV antibodies by Mnt. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 51 (71.8%) camel sera, and no association was observed between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and camel age or gender. These findings extend the known range of MERS-CoV circulation in Middle Eastern camels.",

As of January 29, 2018, there were 2,123 laboratoryconfirmed human MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, including at least 740 MERS-CoV-related deaths (WHO, 2018) . Multiple studies suggest that dromedary camels are a major source for human MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV-specific antibodies have been detected in the serum of dromedary camels across Northern Africa, including Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Somalia, and across the Arabian Peninsula, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and United Arab Emirates Hemida et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2014) . MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies have been detected in 30-year-old archived camel serum samples, suggesting long-term circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in this region . MERS-CoV genome has been detected, isolated and sequenced from camel respiratory specimens in Northern Africa, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, and from an air sample of a camel barn owned by a known MERS-CoV-infected human (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2015; Haagmans et al., 2014; . Genomic and epidemiologic studies comparing MERS-CoV sequences from household clusters and camels, and of dromedary farms and human contacts in UAE (Muhairi et al., 2016; Paden et al., 2017) , and of patients with corresponding MERS-CoV-positive camels in Saudi Arabia (Kasem et al., 2017) demonstrate that camels are a potential source of human MERS-CoV infection.",

While the results do not rule out antibody cross-reactivity, the inability of BCoV immune sera to neutralize MERS-CoV suggests that the presence of BCoV-specific antibodies did not appear to impact the ability tospecifically detect MERS-CoV-specific by Mnt. The circulation of MERS-CoV or a closely related virus in dromedary camels in Israel in the absence of any reported clinical cases of MERS-CoV in the Israeli population suggests that there may be other factors involved in the dynamics of camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV beyond circulation within camel herds.

The following reagent was obtained through the NIH Biodenfense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH: Polyclonal anti-Bovine Coronavirus, Mebus (antiserum, Guinea Pig), NR-455.F I G U R E 1 Camel serum antibodies react to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected, fixed Vero cells by immunofluorescence assay. Vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV (Hu/ Jordan-N3/2012, a-c), or mock-infected (d), fixed, blocked, then incubated with sera from camels with high (a, d), low (b) or no (c) MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and developed for immunofluorescence. Camel sera were determined to be positive (a, b) or negative (c, d) based on the intensity of staining against MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells compared to mock-infected Vero cells (representative samples are shown). Camel sera were also tested against bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-infected or mock-infected MDBK cells using a commercially available test kit (Veterinary Medical Research and Development, VMRD). Shown, serum from a camel that did not react in a MERS-CoV IFA or have MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies reacts to BCoV-infected MDBK cells (e), but not mock-infected MDBK cells (f). DAPI counterstain was used and cells were imaged using a Zeiss AxioImager microscope at 20X magnification [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
