            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led government officials and policy makers to rely on mathematical compartmental models for estimating the potential magnitude of COVID-19 patient volume, particularly at the local peak of the epidemic, in order to make containment and resource planning decisions. Now that the pandemic is already past its peak in many of the hardest hit countries, policy makers are trying to figure out the best policies for gradually easing the lockdown to resume economic and social activity while protecting public health. In this paper, we develop a model for predicting the effects of government policies on COVID-19 fatalities -the developed model (1) is flexibly able to handle model missspecification in a data-driven fashion, (2) is able to quantify the uncertainty in its forecasts, and (3) is able to capture the effect of interventions on these forecasts. Our model is Bayesian: we use a susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered states (SEIR) model as a prior belief on the pandemic curve, and then update the posterior belief based on observed data using a Gaussian process. We incorporate the effects of policies on the future course of the pandemic by calibrating the priors using global data from many countries. * Equal contribution. Preprint.

            "text": "The COVID-19 global pandemic poses a threat not only to public health, but also to the stability of the healthcare infrastructure and economies around the world. Forecasting the spread of the pandemic is crucial for informing governmental response (containment strategies and social distancing measures). Models that are capable of anticipating the different phases of the pandemic in a timely manner can be used to guide these decisions and inform future policy direction. Most existing models rely on mathematical compartmental approaches (e.g., the SEIR model) for estimating the potential magnitude of COVID-19 patient volume. However, these models are sensitive to starting assumptions and thus different models provide considerably different forecasts, resulting in highly uncertain forecasts. Moreover, most of the existing mathematical models have failed to accurately forecast peaks in deaths or cases and subsequent declines because of their rigid assumptions and their inability to account for changes in government-mandated societal interventions over time. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model for forecasting COVID-19 cases and deaths over time. Our model uses a Gaussian process with a mean function defined through a compartmental model as a prior belief on how the pandemic curve will unfold, and then updates its posterior belief on the future forecasts based on current evidence from global disease tracking data. Our model is global in the sense that it jointly incorporates the expected effects of different policies on the pandemic curve by jointly modeling these effects across all countries affected by the pandemic. This is achieved through a hierarchical Gaussian process (GP) model where parameters used to define a nation-specific pandemic curve are shared across all nations based on country-specific indicators. Compared to existing models, our model (1) is flexibly able to handle model miss-specification in a data-driven fashion, (2) is able to quantify uncertainty in these forecasts, and (3) is able to capture the effect of interventions on these forecasts. Comparisons with existing models are provided in Table 1 . Most of the widely-used models for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic are based on either of the two modeling approaches highlighted in Table 1 . For instance, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model in [1] relies on the curve fitting approach to forecast cumulative number of deaths over time, whereas the model in [7] relies on a variant of the SIR model. However, these models do not allow for analyzing counterfactual scenarios on how the COVID-19 fatalities would change under different possible policies for easing the lockdown.",

A single Stringency Index is constructed via a nine-point aggregation of the 9 containment and closure indicators listed in Table 3 .

This is a measure of how many of the these nine indicators (mostly around social isolation) a government has acted upon, and to what degree. This index is used to model the policy stringency variable I i (t) in (1). increasing towards a maximum of 60%, which is significantly less than other Scandinavian countries which adopted an 80-90% stringency since the months of February and March.
