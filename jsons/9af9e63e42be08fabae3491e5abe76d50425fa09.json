Han and colleagues conclude that literature evidence showed that smoking was consistently associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions after influenza infection [7] . Smoking is the primary etiological factor behind chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the developed world, but environmental pollution and degrading air quality are also responsible in developing countries.

In conjunction with the complications arising from comorbidities in patients who smoke [12] , we put forth the question of whether smoking, smoking-induced health conditions, and comorbidities, in combination, is culminating in a high risk demographic for both contraction of the virus and the severe presentation of Covid- 19. China has a high male smoking rate at around 50% in rural areas and is estimated to be about 44.8% overall [13] . Most of the deaths identified from the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak were in men from older age groups and those with underlying conditions such as chronic respiratory disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. The initial age distribution of Covid-19 cases was skewed towards older age groups with a median age of 45 years (IQR 33-56) for patients who were alive or who had an unknown outcome at the time of reporting. The median age of patients who had died at the time of reporting was 70 years (IQR 65-81) as reported by Sun and colleagues [14] .

The Table 1 was adapted from Coronavirus Disease (Covid- 19) Research and Statistics [15] . The term \"coronaviruses\" arose from their crown-like appearance when imaged, the Latin for crown being corona. The distinguishing crown-like feature of coronaviruses is attributed to the presence of large type 1 transmembrane spike (S) glycoproteins. This heavily glycosylated cell surface protein contains two distinct functional domains (S1 and S2) which are thought to mediate host cell entry by the virus. The S1 domain contains the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain and is responsible for first stage host cell entry [16] . The S2 domain facilitates fusion between cell and virus membrane, required for cellular infiltration [17] . S proteins are enzymatically modified, exposing the fusion site for cellular adhesion. This is achieved through cleavage by cellular proteases, mediated by protein convertase called \"furin\" [17, 18] . Furin is expressed significantly in the lungs, and respiratory viruses also utilize this system to convert their surface proteins [17] . Although the S protein cleavage site is less observed in coronavirus with similar genomic sequence [17] , it is essential to note that more pathogenic influenza viruses share similar cleavage sites [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 781, "end": 785, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 889, "end": 893, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1090, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1094, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1231, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1337, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1436, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 149, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The ACE2 receptor provides a human cell-binding site for the S protein for the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [20] [21] [22] (a virus that was first identified in 2003 in a southern province of China [23] [24] [25] ), the coronavirus NL63 [20, 26] , and now SARS-CoV-2 [27] . Recent studies have found that the modified S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly higher affinity for ACE2 and is 10-to 20-fold more likely to bind to ACE2 in human cells than the S protein of the previous SARS-CoV [28, 29] . This increase in affinity may enable easier person-to-person spread of the virus and thus contribute to a higher estimated R0 for SARS-CoV-2 than the previous SARS virus.

Guoshuai Cai recently reported higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to never-smokers. Zhao et al. observed that ACE2 is expressed explicitly in type-2 pneumocytes, in which genes regulating viral reproduction and transmission are highly expressed [31] . This indicates that smokers may be more susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and possibly Covid-19. We recently identified enhanced ACE2 expression in resected lung tissue from patients with COPD and healthy lung function smokers, albeit comparably less in the latter, while entirely absent in heathy non-smoking individuals ( Figure 1 ). ACE2 expression was quite evident in the type-2 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and the apical end of the small airway epithelium. COPD patients showed significantly higher levels of ACE2, suggesting that COPD further exaggerates ACE2 and potential SARS-CoV-2 adhesion site. ACE2 expression could also be true for patients with another chronic lung disease such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [32] . The attachment of the virus to cell surface ACE2 protects them from immune surveillance mechanisms, leaving them tagged to the host for relatively longer periods, thus making them an efficient carrier and vulnerable host for future infections and spread. The eventual engulfment of ACE2 further provides the virus access to the host cells system, thus providing a flourishing environment, not just to sustain and proliferate but also to mutate and modify host evasion mechanisms. Previous observations using in vivo knockout mice models suggest that SARS-CoV-2 adhesion on ACE2 could also downmodulate the expression of ACE2 itself. This, in turn, increases the production and activation of other related ACE enzymes. This differential modulation and the drastic reduction in ACE2 results in severe acute respiratory failure [33, 34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1101, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1933, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1937, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 687, "end": 695, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Wang et al. also noted an ACE2 connection to smoking and Covid-19 [35] .
