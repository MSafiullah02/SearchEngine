            "text": "Infection with MERS-CoV in humans results in a range of different clinical manifestations, from mild to severe disease. Infection is frequently associated with respiratory disease, although in rare cases viral RNA has been found in blood, stool and urine suggesting a systemic infection (Drosten et al., 2013, Guery et al., 2013, Kapoor et al., 2014). Based on detection of a higher viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) compared to oral swabs, viral replication is thought to predominantly take place in the lower respiratory tract (Bermingham et al., 2012, Drosten et al., 2013, Guery et al., 2013). This is supported by radiology as well as the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in a portion of the patients. A broad range of different symptoms has been reported, including fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhea. In severe cases, patients present with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Underlying comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II and cardiac disease have been associated with a fatal outcome of MERS-CoV infection (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014, Al-Tawfiq et al., 2013, Arabi et al., 2014, Assiri et al., 2013, Bermingham et al., 2012).",

This suggests that virus transmission in humans is currently self-limiting. Clusters of transmission are associated with a hospital setting often lacking appropriate infection control measures, or close contacts (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014, Assiri et al., 2013, Guery et al., 2013, Health Protection Agency, 2013).

The recurrent outbreaks of MERS-CoV in humans in the Arabian peninsula and the identification of travel-related MERS cases in Africa, Europe, North America and Asia, highlights the need for medical countermeasures. Currently no vaccines or effective antiviral drugs exist against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or any other human coronavirus. For the preclinical development of MERS-CoV-specific medical countermeasures there is need for established animal models that recapitulate the severe disease observed in humans. In addition, animal models are needed for dissection of the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity of MERS-CoV and the study of cross-species and human-to-human transmission. The continuous development of appropriate animal models to conduct medical countermeasure research is therefore of utmost importance.",

            "text": "Small animal models are regularly used as a first line of research on emerging viruses. Often a virus needs to be adapted to the small animal model of interest, such as was the case for SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2007) and Ebola virus (Bray et al., 1998), potentially altering the disease-causing mechanisms in comparison to wild-type virus in the human host. Ideally an animal model should reproduce the hallmarks of human disease as closely as possible in an immunocompetent animal following a realistic dose of challenge virus via an appropriate inoculation route (Safronetz et al., 2013). An important component of the FDA\u2019s Animal Rule, which concerns the approval of new drugs when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, states that FDA will rely on evidence from animal studies if the animal models used are expected to react with a response predictive of humans or a single animal model is sufficiently characterized to predict the human response (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, 2014). As such, species closely related to humans, such as non-human primates, have a greater potential to be developed into models predictive of human response and disease outcome. Importantly, for the evaluation of specific antivirals and vaccines these disease models will provide the best predictive value.",

            "text": "The coronavirus spike (S) protein binds to a cell-associated receptor prior to entry. The specific receptor as well as the ability of the S protein to bind to different variants of this receptor determines the host tropism of the virus (Graham and Baric, 2010, van Doremalen et al., 2014). The receptor for MERS-CoV was identified to be an exopeptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Raj et al., 2013). DPP4 is a type II cell surface glycoprotein which forms dimers and has a widespread organ distribution, with a variable and cell-dependent expression pattern. DPP4 is multifunctional and plays a role in processes such as cell adhesion, apoptosis and lymphocyte stimulation (Lambeir et al., 2003). For this last function, the interaction between DPP4 and adenosine deaminase (ADA) is thought to be of importance. Interestingly, the amino acids of DPP4 interacting with ADA show a great overlap with the amino acids interacting with MERS-CoV S protein (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013). During species evolution the need to maintain the interaction between ADA and DPP4 might have limited the potential of variation of the interacting amino acids. This restriction in variability of DPP4 orthologs could explain the relatively large number of potential hosts of MERS-CoV based on in vitro data (Chan et al., 2013a, Chan et al., 2013b, Kindler et al., 2013, Muller et al., 2012). ADA was shown to compete with S for binding with DPP4, highlighting the similarities in protein\u2013protein contact between these two complexes (Raj et al., 2014b).",

A number of interacting amino acids were identified (Table 1\n) and used to predict the ability of various species to function as a host for MERS-CoV (van Doremalen et al., 2014). This method can be particularly useful when choosing potential animal models and searching for reservoir or intermediate hosts.",

In vitro, it was shown that expression of human DPP4 and other orthologs of DPP4 on non-susceptible cells rendered them susceptible, whereas this was not the case for hamster, mouse and ferret DPP4 (Cockrell et al., 2014, Raj et al., 2014b, van Doremalen et al., 2014). Alteration of just five amino acids in hamster DPP4 (van Doremalen et al., 2014) and two in mouse DPP4 (Cockrell et al., 2014) allowed for entry of MERS-CoV into previously non-susceptible cells. This underlines the lack of variability between DPP4 orthologs and the associated potential for the S protein to adapt to different host species.",

This has been done previously for Ebola virus by serially passaging the virus in progressively older suckling mice (Bray et al., 1998) and for SARS-CoV by 15 passages in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice (Roberts et al., 2007). Further investigation of the six amino acid mutations in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV identified a single amino acid change within the S protein as necessary, but not sufficient for the observed increased pathogenicity, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV. This is thought to be associated with an increased affinity for the murine receptor ortholog (Frieman et al., 2012). Interestingly, both mouse and hamster DPP4 contain a R336T substitution which removes a highly conserved positive charge and introduces a glycosylation site. For murine DPP4, this glycosylation site has been shown to be a hindrance in cell entry for MERS-CoV (Peck et al., 2015). Glycosylation of DPP4 might be an important limitation in the ability to adapt MERS-CoV to a host in the development of small animal models.",

Furthermore, certain hallmarks of severe disease observed in humans, such as consolidation of the lungs and changes in blood chemistry indicative of liver or kidney failure, are reproduced in the marmoset model. The evaluation of antivirals and vaccines might therefore be more predictive in marmosets than in rhesus macaques. However, the relatively small size of the marmoset limits the number of samples that can be taken and consequently the data obtained within an experiment.

Although more than a thousand cases of MERS-CoV have been detected, overall the transmission potential of the virus has been limited and is mostly observed in hospital settings (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014, Assiri et al., 2013, Guery et al., 2013, Health Protection Agency, 2013). As such, widespread vaccination against MERS-CoV in endemic areas seems currently unnecessary. Instead, potential vaccination programs should focus on individuals most at risk of contracting or spreading MERS-CoV. Two different groups qualify for this approach: at-risk groups consisting of people with immunocompromising health issues or other comorbidities, such as diabetes, and people who are more commonly exposed to the virus via work-related activities, such as animal handlers and health-care providers. A recent cross-sectional serological study from Saudi Arabia found that seroprevalence was increased by 15 times in shepherds and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers compared to the general population, providing support for this potential vaccination approach (Muller et al., 2015). An alternative vaccination approach would be to prevent zoonotic transmission by vaccinating young camels, thereby reducing or limiting the exposure of humans to MERS-CoV. Several studies are currently looking into the potential of the development of a camel vaccine against MERS-CoV as a countermeasure to block camel-to-human transmission (Kupferschmidt, 2015).",

The hDPP4-expressing mice model is a perfect first-line model to investigate the correlates of protection of these vaccines. This is of particular importance with coronaviruses, as some coronavirus vaccines showed immune-mediated enhancement of disease, or so-called \u201cvaccine-induced immunopotentiation.\u201d For these vaccines, vaccine-induced immunity in animals is atypical and wanes quickly. Subsequent infection with the agent of interest then results in increased pathology compared to unvaccinated animals (Deming et al., 2006, Vennema et al., 1990). For SARS-CoV, this effect is thought to be caused by incorporation of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, resulting in induction of an atypical Th2 adaptive immune response and consequently eosinophilic immunopathology rather than the Th1 immune response associated with natural SARS-CoV infection (Bolles et al., 2011a, Tseng et al., 2012, Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al., 2007, Wong et al., 2004, Yasui et al., 2008).",

Immunization with VRP-S using a prime-boost regimen reduced MERS-CoV titers to nearly undetectable levels by day 1 p.i. (Zhao et al., 2014). Volz et al. demonstrate protection against MERS-CoV by modified vaccinia virus Ankara S protein (MVA-MERS-S) vaccination of mice sensitized with adenovirus expressing human DPP4. Single subcutaneous or intramuscular immunization with different doses of MVA-MERS-S resulted in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies as well as S antigen-specific T cells in mice. Transduction of mice 45 days postvaccination with adenovirus expressing hDPP4 and subsequent challenge with MERS-CoV 50 days postvaccination resulted in a decrease in pathological changes and significantly lower viral loads in lung tissue compared to mock-vaccinated control mice (Volz et al., 2015) (Table 3).",

After efficacy of combination treatment with ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12b was shown in vitro (Falzarano et al., 2013a), in vivo efficacy was verified in rhesus macaques. Upon treatment with both IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin eight hours postinfection, animals showed a much milder disease compared to untreated infected macaques; no to very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia, decreased proinflammatory markers, decreased viral load and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. This study suggests that treatment of MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin improves outcome of infection (Falzarano et al., 2013b).",

Likewise, convalescent sera obtained from camels decreased pathological changes and increased viral clearance in the lungs of mice sensitized to MERS-CoV with adenovirus\u2013hDPP4 (Zhao et al., 2015). Finally, administration of monoclonal antibodies in transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 in place of mouse DPP4 one day before or one day after challenge with MERS-CoV resulted in a significant decrease in viral titers in lungs compared to controls (Pascal et al., 2015) (Table 4\n).
