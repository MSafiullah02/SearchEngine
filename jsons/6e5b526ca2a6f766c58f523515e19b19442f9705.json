Early reports have shown improved clinical outcome and viral clearance with the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. 1, 2 The results of a recent open-label nonrandomized clinical trial by Gautret and colleagues 3 suggest that the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced polymerase chain reaction detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples by 6 days in 6 patients compared to 14 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. 3 Patients with baseline prolonged QT intervals were excluded from this study, since both drugs are known to prolong the QT interval, which may increase the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP).",

Owing to lack of improvement, she presented to the emergency room and was found to be hypoxic. Computed tomography showed widespread ground-glass opacities as well as honeycombing of the right lung ( Figure 1 ). COVID-19 was suspected and testing was eventually positive. Within 48 hours she developed profound respiratory failure and required intubation. She also required adrenergic support with norepinephrine. She was started on intravenous azithromycin on March 18. The decision was made to start hydroxychloroquine on March 21; however, it was stopped after 1 dose owing to a QTc of 620 ms with a notched broad T wave ( Figure 2A ). No ventricular ectopy was present. Serum potassium and magnesium were 4.4 mM and 2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Electrophysiology consultation recommended 100 mg intravenous lidocaine followed by a repeat 12-lead electrocardiogram. This revealed a shortening of the QTc to 550 ms ( Figure 2B ). It was recommended to restart hydroxychloroquine and begin a lidocaine infusion. The patient was able to complete the course of hydroxychloroquine without an arrhythmic event. Despite receiving a full course of hydroxychloroquine, she remained ventilator dependent and died owing to progressive metabolic acidosis and multiorgan system failure on March 25. By the time hydroxychloroquine was first initiated, she had already been intubated for 72 hours and was in severe respiratory failure. Owing to several similar consults in COVID-19 patients with borderline or increased QTc intervals, we developed a flow chart that addresses QT interval management in order to help clinicians taking care of COVID-19 patients who require chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin ( Figure 3 ).",

The deaths reported in this study, however, occurred during the 5 days of therapy, after which the cardiovascular death rate was no different from the other groups. 9 This risk would clearly be less for an inpatient cohort on telemetry and not as relevant for COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital.",

Known therapies to mitigate TdP, such as maintaining potassium and magnesium levels and heart rates .70 beats per minute, are incorporated into our flow chart. Another option may be to use mexiletine in patients able to take oral medications. Unfortunately, this patient died despite receiving therapy. Hydroxychloroquine was started late into her course (4 days after presentation and 3 days after intubation); therefore, it is uncertain whether she would have survived had hydroxychloroquine been started earlier. Her previous history of rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma placed her at a higher risk for mortality as well.",

            "text": "In conclusion, although the theoretical risk of acquired LQTS and TdP is present with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or azithromycin used alone or in combination, previous reports of combined treatment in malaria patients suggest that the risk is very low. In COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized, however, there may be an increased risk of QT prolongation and TdP owing to previous or concurrent medications, age, sex, or metabolic derangements (pH, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, and multiorgan system failure), as well as previous cardiovascular disease. Recent reports suggest that direct viral-or autoimmune-induced myocardial injury may also occur in COVID-19 patients. [16] [17] [18] Certainly, the use of combination therapy with azithromycin and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in patients with congenital or acquired LQTS must be carefully weighed against the risks. The use of late sodium channel-blocking drugs like lidocaine or mexiletine and careful attention to serum electrolytes, heart rate, and monitoring of QTc intervals may allow administration of a full course of these drugs, even in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Further data will be required to determine if this approach can be safely applied to the majority of COVID-19 patients in need of such therapy.
