The use of RAAS-acting medications was more frequent in cases than in controls, both for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (23.9% vs 21.4%) and for angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs; 22.2% vs 19.2%). The use of other antihypertensives and other medications was also higher in cases compared with controls, especially loop diuretics and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists, and they tended to have worse clinical profiles.",
