They have been widely used for biomarker discovery and to study protein-protein interactions. The accomplishments of DNA microarray technology, which had enabled massive parallel studies of gene expression, sparked great interest for the development of protein microarrays to achieve similar success at the protein level. Protein microarray detection techniques are often classified as being label-based and label-free. Most of the microarray applications have employed labelled detection such as fluorescent, chemiluminescent and radioactive labelling. These labelling strategies have synthetic challenges, multiple label issues and may exhibit interference with the binding site. Therefore, development of sensitive, reliable, high-throughput, label-free detection techniques are now attracting significant attention. Label-free detection techniques monitor biomolecular interactions and simplify the bioassays by eliminating the need for secondary reactants. Moreover, they provide quantitative information for the binding kinetics. In this article, we will review several label-free techniques, which offer promising applications for the protein microarrays, and discuss their prospects, merits and challenges.",

In order to study the complexity of proteome, various proteomic techniques, including protein microarrays, have emerged during the past few years. A protein microarray provides a multiplex platform for high throughput (HT) studies. Two different strategies have been used for protein microarrays [1]: (i) abundance based, where specific capture molecules such as antibodies and aptamers are spotted on the array or RP protein blots, where complex mixtures such as cell lysates are spotted and abundance of biomolecules are measured by antibodies; and (ii) function based, where purified proteins or proteins generated from cell-free expression system are spotted on the array (Fig. 1) . Protein microarrays have been successfully applied for protein-protein interactions [2], cytokine detection [3] , protein-DNA interactions [4] , kinase target identification [5] , detection of various antigens and antibodies [6] as well as for biomarker discovery [7] .",

Dynamic range, real-time monitoring, multiplexing and HT capability, widespread applicability and data handling are other key determining factors [10, 11] . In protein microarray experiments, signals can be detected by label-based or labelfree strategies. Both the approaches have their merits and demerits. The label-based detection methods require labelling of query molecules with fluorescent dyes, radioisotopes or epitope tags. Label-based detection is widely used in protein microarrays due to the common availability of reagents and simple instrument requirements. However, these labelling strategies often alter surface characteristics and natural activities of the query molecule. Moreover, the labelling procedure is laborious, lengthy and limits the number and types of query molecules that can be studied [12] . In contrast to the label-based techniques, the label-free detection methods depend on the measurement of an inherent property of the query itself, such as mass and dielectric property. Label-free techniques avoid interference due to the tagging molecules, and determine reaction kinetics of biomolecular interactions in real-time [6, 13] . However, the label-free detection techniques also have multiple pitfalls and issues regarding sensitivity and specificity (Table 1) . Further, expensive fabrication techniques, morphological anomalies of sample spots and insufficient knowledge of biosensors often restrict their use.",

Quantum dots have been successfully introduced in biochemical and clinical research due to its ability to conjugate with different biomolecules such as peptides, proteins, nucleic acids and antibodies [14, 15] . Nam et al. reported detection of protein analytes by using nanoparticle-based bio-bar codes [16] .

The angle at which the minimum intensity of the reflected light is obtained is known as the ''SPR angle'', which is directly related to the amount of biomolecules bound to the gold surface. SPR has been widely used for many biomedical, food and environmental applications [29] . The critical angle refractometer, optically reconfigured to SPR technology, is suitable for measuring the binding kinetics of serum antibodies to human tumour antigen for the rapid diagnosis of cancer patients [30] .

Lausted et al. [44] used SPRi for label-free analysis of an antibody microarray (792 features) having serum proteins from liver cancer patients and healthy subjects. The authors successfully identified 39 significantly modulated proteins. Preliminary promising results suggest that the use of protein chips for SPRi at proteome level may not be unachievable. SPRi is a potential alternative to labelbased detection techniques and offers nearly comparable sensitivity (picomolar level) to single-colour and dual-colour labelling approaches. But at the same time, it must also be emphasized that despite all its promises, SPRi is still a long way off from large scale use in protein microarrays.",

Landry et al. [62] detected hundreds of real-time biochemical reactions using this versatile optical platform. They performed the analysis of binding reactions between immobilized drug-antigen target and probe antibody. Very high sensitivity (down to 10 pm thickness changes), rapid detection, large field view and real-time measurements are the major advantages of this imaging ellipsometry-based approach. Moreover, unlike SPRi it is not dependent on the gold-coated surfaces and is applicable to conventional microscope glass slides. ",

Improvement in immobilization of capture biomolecules onto the materials can effectively enhance the sensitivity of EIS, leading to the introduction of aptamers in EIS-based biosensing studies. Aptamers are short pieces of singlestranded oligonucleotide that can bind to wide range of molecular targets including peptides, proteins, metabolites and organic molecules with immense affinity and selectivity. Aptamers are highly promising capture molecules in microarray formats due to their structural stability and simple synthesis process. Effective binding of the desired target is dependent on correct folding of the aptamers, and is controlled by orientation of the immobilized aptamer [102] . A novel aptamer-based technique called ''analytedependent oligonucleotide modulation assay'' was introduced by Yamamoto-Fujita and Kumar [103] for analysis of protein small-ligand interactions. Evans et al.

            "text": "The rapidly emerging field of proteomics has now established itself as an inevitable platform to enrich our understanding of biological systems. Protein microarray is a HT analytical technique for protein profiling, which enables us to investigate thousands of proteins simultaneously. Many limitations of label-based detection methods for protein microarrays have been successfully surmounted with the introduction of label-free approaches, in which detection of target molecules is achieved by evaluating an inherent property of the query itself. Among the emerging labelfree detection techniques for protein microarrays, SPRi, CNTs, semi-conducting nanowires, interferometric and ellipsometric techniques have attracted considerable interest due to their excellent sensitivity, high level of multiplexing and HT capability. These techniques have demonstrated a wide dynamic range and promise to meet the sensing needs of protein microarrays. Concurrent with the exploration of new effects, AFM and AIR, may also have significant impact for protein microarrays. Real-time sensing, apparatus simplicity and elimination of disturbances from conjugated labels make these HT label-free detection methods a prime choice for biological analysis. Successful detection of kinetic information as well as in situ identification of various biological species with outstanding performance testifies to the excellent potential of these novel label-free techniques. Development of label-free detection tools is undoubtedly a great benediction for the large-scale study of protein-protein interactions. These highly sensitive, reliable label-free detection techniques also have revolutionizing impacts in the areas of pharmaceutical analysis, screening of potential drugs, cellular detection, biomolecular characterization, disease diagnostics and environmental monitoring. However, sensitivity and specificity often become major concerns for such label-free techniques during handling of very complex samples. Marriage of microarrays and label-free techniques is gaining popularity; however, the scientific community is still waiting for successful transformation of these label-free principles to large microarray surfaces. Emerging label-free detection techniques have demonstrated their applicability to protein microarrays by testing antigen-antibody interactions, what remains to be seen is how these detection techniques would be able to test clinically relevant, weak protein-protein interactions in HT. With the ongoing active research efforts, it is expected that the field of label-free protein microarrays will become more robust, sensitive, reliable, rapid, costeffective and user-friendly in near future.",
