SARI is associated with viral and bacterial agents. Common viral agents are influenza A (Infl A) and B (Infl B) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), adenoviruses (AV), and rhinoviruses. Influenza virus infection, in particular, is very common followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (CDC, 2016, Laguna-Torres et al., 2011, Chakhunashvili et al., 2018, Kenmoe et al., 2016, Tjon-Kon-Fat et al., 2016). Newer respiratory pathogens are also emerging. In view of this, we investigated the association of human PARV4 virus with SARI.",

Seroprevalence of PARV4 in the general population has been varying in different parts of the world ranging from 0% to 25% (Sharp et al., 2012, Lavoie et al., 2012). A study from Africa reports PARV4 in 0.8% of nasal swab specimens, whereas a study from Scotland did not observe PARV4in respiratory samples (Drexler et al., 2012, Manning et al., 2006).",

Each real time PCR consisted of positive, negative and extraction controls. The result was reported only if all the controls were valid. All the samples of both cases (SARI) and controls were also tested for presence of PARV4-DNA using primers and probes described in patent no. PCT/IN2015/000409 and WO2016071926A9 by Jain and Prakash (2016). Total viral nucleic acid was extracted from 200 \u03bcl NS/TS sample using PureLink DNA/RNA mini kit (Invitrogen, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions and processed for TaqMan real time PCR. The real time PCR reaction mix contained 12.5 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 master mix (LightCycler 480 Probes Master, Roche Diagnostics, Nederland BV, Almere, the Netherlands), 1 \u03bcl of Parv4 forward and reverse primer (10 pm/\u03bcl) and 0.5 \u03bcl taqmanprobe (10 pm/\u03bcl)(IDT, USA) and 5 \u03bcl H2O (DNAse and RNAse free). Finally, 5 \u03bcl extracted total nucleic acid was added to 20 \u03bcl of prepared mastermix, making it a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. Real time RT-PCR assays were performed on Quantstudio 7 (Life Technologies, USA).",

In the past, studies have described an association of PARV4 with influenza-like symptoms, encephalitis (Benjamin et al., 2011, Prakash et al., 2015), transient rash and hepatitis (Sharp et al., 2012), foetal hydrops (Chen et al., 2011) and acceleration of progression to AIDS in HIV-infected adults (Simmons et al., 2012). Transmission via respiratory secretions or faeces suggestive of respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis is also suggested.13 Groups with risk factors for parenteral infection and those infected with either HBV or HCV or HIV have associated PARV4 infections, suggesting parenteral transmission. Intravenous drug users and those with a history of multiple transfusions have a high positivity of PARV4 (Jones et al., 2005, Simmonds et al., 2007b, Fryer et al., 2007a).",
