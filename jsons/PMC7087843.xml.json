Although I have a medical degree, I could not determine the cause of her problem, and because the rash was getting worse, I decided to take her to a nearby walk-in clinic. By the time she was seen by a family physician, the rash had covered her body completely. While I expected that the physician would ask a broad range of diagnostic questions, I was perturbed when he started his clinical inquiry with the question, \u201cHave you been abroad recently?\u201d The questions on potential food and drug allergies, family skin diseases or recent exposure to infections were on the bottom of his list.",

However, as a public health researcher knowledgeable about health issues surrounding immigration and also as a visible minority immigrant patient, I am quite concerned with this question\u2019s priority status. Therefore, in this work I would like to deconstruct the notion of race and ethnicity as risk factors for ill health and, as well, elaborate on the relevance of these epidemiological categories to medicine and society. By the end of this article, readers should be able to understand to what degree someone\u2019s race and ethnicity can be associated with his or her ill health. They should also be able to trace the roots of the thought processes that led the physician examining my daughter to suspect a foreign origin of her condition prior to considering other options.",

The role of epidemiologists is therefore to search for the existing associations between these particular categories and specific diseases in order to determine the risk factors. Some results of this epidemiological quest are well-known. For instance, old age is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, a sex worker\u2019s occupation with a higher risk of sexually transmitted disease, and a smoker\u2019s lifestyle with cancer. The purpose of epidemiological categories such as a patient\u2019s ethnicity and race can be understood in a similar way. For example, while Canadian Aboriginals are found to be at a higher risk of drug abuse-related health problems,2 immigrants are associated with a higher risk of developing tuberculosis than their non-Aboriginal counterparts.3\n",

For example, if Aboriginal people are found to be at a higher risk of contracting HIV than other groups in Canada, then public health efforts can be directed towards Aboriginal communities. Linking one\u2019s race or ethnicity and a specific health problem can attract more resources with which to address a broader range of health-relevant problems in that particular community. Furthermore, without recognizing race or ethnicity, scientists, researchers, decision makers and service providers cannot truly identify those who are the most disadvantaged and the most deserving of their help.",

As a result, it is often someone\u2019s personal agency that is blamed for his/her final health outcomes rather than the social environment in which these health outcomes are embedded.7\n,\n8 The single association between a patient\u2019s race or ethnicity and health may not reveal other important factors shaping his or her risk of exposure or susceptibility to disease. For instance, it is well established that tuberculosis is a social disease affecting largely those at the bottom of the social ladder. In fact, some authors consider tuberculosis as a penalty for \u201cruthless exploitation\u201d of the poor in capitalist economies.9\n,\n10 For this reason, establishing that being an Aboriginal or a Third World person is per se a risk factor for developing tuberculosis ignores large socio-economic and political forces which frame the life chances and health of these people.",
