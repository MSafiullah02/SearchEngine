Clinical picture of influenza virus infection includes symptoms such as chills, increased body temperature, dry cough, chest pain, or dizziness as well as headaches and muscle aches. In the diagnosis of influenza, quick and effective tests are necessary. Sensitive diagnostic methods of molecular biology require more time, but the result firmly confirm or exclude the presence of the genetic material of influenza or other respiratory viruses. Influenza vaccination plays an important role in combating influenza infection. Unfortunately, the awareness of vaccination benefits is insufficient in Poland. In this study we demonstrate the results of examination of 4,507 people aged over 14 years toward the influenza infection in the epidemic season of 2017/18. Most of the confirmed infections were reported in older people aged over 65, a high-risk population group. A low percentage of the vaccinated population may affect an increased number of confirmed influenza viruses in the elderly. The findings demonstrate a need to increase awareness of vaccination benefits, which is particularly essential to avoid influenza infection in the elderly.",

The fastest diagnostic method is a rapid influenza swab-based testing that shows sensitivity of about 70% or between 27% and 61%, depending on the source. The advantage of this test the speed as it takes 15-30 min to complete and the ease of performing it as it can be done outside a specialized laboratory. The disadvantage, however, is a substantial risk of false negative results due to rather low sensitivity or false positive results due to misinterpretation of weak bands in the test (Dwyer et al. 2006 ). The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the most sensitive method for the detection of viral genetic material. This method takes less than a working day to complete a test and the advantage is the ability to detect more than just one respiratory virus when a multiplex set is used. Another possible method is the immunofluorescence-based reaction of hemagglutination inhibition, which defines the antiviral antibody titers (Kissova et al. 2014) .",

Studies have shown that people vaccinated against influenza have significantly fewer influenza-like virus infections (Taksler et al. 2015) . The knowledge about the benefits of influenza vaccination is insufficient in Poland, among both the medical personnel and the lay public. Parents do not vaccinate their children against influenza due mostly to the lack of knowledge about the benefits of it (Wozniak-Kosek et al. 2015) . The risk-benefit ratio of vaccination has changed downward over the past decades, reducing mortality, particularly among adults (Pfleiderer 2014; Brydak 2012) . A greater coverage rate of vaccination also substantially reduces the economic impact of influenza infection. A previous study showed that about 50% of older people who had been vaccinated developed influenza in the season of 2015/16, but they did not require hospitalization, which points to a mild course of the infection. Influenza vaccine also is fully effective in older people with the underlying chronic pathological conditions (Rondy et al. 2017) . The present study seeks to determine the incidence of influenza infection in persons aged over 14 years in the epidemic season of 2017/18 in Poland.",

The percentage of people vaccinated against influenza in the fall of 2017 was 1.57% and 7.52% in the respective cohorts. For comparison, the vaccination rate was 3.7% in the 2017/18 season in the population of the entire country (PZH 2018 Thus, those who cannot be vaccinated against influenza, for instance, due to allergies to vaccine ingredients, such as gelatin or some antibiotics, which often concerns children below the age of 6 months, would also be protected to an extent on the basis of collective resistance (CDC 2018b). Previous studies have shown that the vaccination coverage in a population should range from 33% to 73% to maximize the benefits of collective immunity and to reduce the transmission of influenza viruses (Logan et al. 2018; Plans-Rubi\u00f3 2012) . The present report demonstrates that influenza viruses can infect an adult person of any age. A study by Caini et al. (2018) have pointed, however, to the possibility of some age-dependent patterns of infection in that influenza B is more frequently detected in older children, while the subtype A(H3N2) is more common in the elderly.",
