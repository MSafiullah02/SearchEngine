Unfortunately, HSV PCR testing often requires a third-party laboratory and subsequent prolonged acyclovir exposure and inpatient hospitalization, which impose a significant financial burden. As a result, multiple institutions have limited HSV PCR testing to patients with pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies.12 However, this practice can lead to delay in diagnosis of HSV CNS disease as the virus can be present in the absence of pleocytosis.13\u201316",

Nevertheless, the decrease in time to results and hospital days are expected to translate to increased savings for patients. It is also important to note that the NICU at BAMC is a \u201cclean unit,\u201d meaning all admissions from the clinic or the emergency department is admitted to the pediatric ward or the PICU even if under 30 days of age. Consideration of the admitting unit was taken for cost analysis, as shown in Table 2.",
