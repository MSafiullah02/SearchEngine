Laboratory-reared flies were experimentally fed with a mixture containing the AI virus. Exposed flies were washed with brain-heart infusion broth and followed by 70% alcohol before preparation of whole fly homogenate. The homogenate was inoculated into six 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Allantoic fluids were collected to determine the virus using the haemagglutination (HA) test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR). In the first experiment, ECEs that were inoculated with the 50 AI virus exposed fly homogenates died within 48 h and HA and RT-PCR were positive for AI virus. In the second experiment, ECEs that were inoculated with only one fly died with positive HA test and RT-PCR. In the last experiment, a group of exposed flies was collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h post-exposure. Fly homogenates of each time point were tested by virus titration in ECEs and RRT-PCR. Virus titres declined in relation to exposure time. Furthermore, RRT-PCR results were positive at any time point. The present study shows that the flies may harbour the AI virus and could act as a mechanical vector of the AI virus.",

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, especially subtype H5N1, cause a multi-systemic disease associated with high morbidity and mortality in poultry, as well as in mammals and humans (Mahy & Van Regenmortel, 2008) . The emergence of the AI H5N1 virus was first reported in 1996 in mainland China (Chen et al., 2004) and later spread to live poultry markets in Hong Kong (Sims et al., 2005) . In early 2004, AI H5N1 virus outbreaks were reported in several Asian countries including Thailand. Since then, the viruses have spread to many areas around the world, causing major economic loss in poultry industries (OIE, 2008) . Moreover, the impact from AI H5N1 virus outbreaks is not limited to poultry species as the virus also infects other animals and humans. As of September 2009, there are more than 442 human cases with 262 fatal cases. This leads to a serious concern regarding the pandemic potential of the AI H5N1 virus (WHO, 2009) .",

They can be further sub-typed based on the two major antigens: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, 16 subtypes of HA (H1-16) and 9 of NA (N1-9) have been identified (Fouchier et al., 2005) . In general, viruses of all HA and NA subtypes are found in aquatic birds. Among the 16 HA subtypes, only H5 and H7 are virulent in poultry (Alexander, 2000) . By contrast, only three HA subtypes (H1, H2 and H3) and two NA subtypes (N1 and N2) have commonly been found in humans. However, over the past few years, several subtypes of AI viruses including H5N1, H7N7, H7N3 and H9N2 have directly crossed the species barrier to infect humans (Mahy & Van Regenmortel, 2008) .",

Importantly, house flies can be mechanical and/or biological vectors for a number of major pathogens in the animal production system such as Aeromonas caviae (Nayduch et al., 2002) , Shigella spp. (Greenberg, 1973) , Salmonella spp. (Holt et al., 2007) , Escherichia coli (De Jesus et al., 2004) , Vibrio cholerae (Yap et al., 2008) , Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (Watson et al., 2007) , turkey coronavirus (Calibeo-Hayes et al., 2003) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Otake et al., 2003) , rotavirus (Tan et al., 1997) , Microsporum canis (Cafarchia et al., 2009 ) and metazoan parasites (F\u00f6rster et al., 2007) . House flies transmit pathogens via mouthparts, vomit droplets, faeces and their body surface (Greenberg, 1973) . Their ability to disperse contaminated pathogens correlates with the flying distance which was shown to be approximately 1-3 km per day (Herms et al., 1969) . Accordingly, house flies are considered as an important vector for spreading disease in the poultry production system. The objective of the present study was to determine the potential of the house fly as a vector of the AI H5N1 virus.",

The W1 washing fluid was titrated by inoculation into a 10-dayold embryonated chicken and the W1 washing fluid titre was compared with the virus titre in fly homogenate. The steps for virus isolation and identification were performed as previously described in experiment 1. Experiment 3. This experiment aimed to evaluate the correlation between the time period after exposure and AI H5N1 virus viability in AI H5N1 exposed house flies. The house flies were separated into two groups; each group was exposed to the mixture containing the AI H5N1 virus or without as previously described. After exposure to the virus, standard food (UHT milk mixed with 10% sucrose) was provided for all groups throughout experiment and five AI H5N1 exposed house flies from each group were examined for the presence of the AI H5N1 virus at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h postexposure. The AI H5N1-exposed flies collected from each time period were washed three times and homogenized as previously described, to determine the presence of AI H5N1 viruses.",

            "text": "The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 causes serious problems not only in poultry industries but also poses a threat to human health. Generally, the poultry production system in Thailand can be divided into four sectors namely, the industrial integrated system, the semi-vertical integrated system, extensive farming and backyard. In extensive farming (e.g. layer hens, broilers, ducks and free-grazing ducks) and backyards (e.g. chickens, ducks and fighting cocks) they live in close proximity with their owners and are freely in contact with the other animals (Tiensin et al., 2007) . Then, the manure of this poultry unit was a perfect breeding place for house flies. Moreover, Thailand's climate is appropriate for the development of house flies. Previous studies showed that house flies could act as a vector for transmitting disease to poultry farms and flies readily move between poultry buildings (Lysyk & Axtell, 1986) . Therefore, the potential of house flies to act as a vector for the AI H5N1 virus was determined in the present study. Here we demonstrated that house flies that consumed food contaminated with AI H5N1 could carry the virus within their bodies for a long period of time at least 72 h post-exposure. The virus was detected both in the homogenates of whole flies and the external surfaces of flies at high levels. Moreover, virus titres of a whole fly homogenate compared with that of washing fluid revealed that the viruses could be detected in homogenates of whole flies for up to 96 h post-exposure, whereas these viruses could be detected in external surfaces of house flies for only up to 24 h postexposure (Table 1 ). The capacity of a house fly to carry the AI H5N1 virus via whole fly homogenate was significantly higher than that of the external surface (P < 0.05). Our finding is consistent with Otake et al. (2003) that found viable porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in the internal organs of house flies higher than the external surface. A separate study detected higher levels of Exotic Newcastle disease virus (ENDV) from the whole house fly homogenate than the level of virus from the body surface (Chakrabarti et al., 2008) . In general, the avian influenza virus can survive in an environment for a period of time (Swayne & Halvorson, 2003) . Optimum humidity, temperature and organic materials including nasal discharge and faeces can prolong the survival time of many viruses (Pantin-Jackwood & Swayne, 2009). The AI H5N2 virus can survive in faeces at 4 \u2022 C for 30-35 days and at 20 \u2022 C for 7 days (Swayne & Halvorson, 2003) . In contrast, the AI H5N1 virus can survive at 25 \u2022 C for 24 h, and at 40 \u2022 C for 15 min (Chumpolbanchorn et al., 2006) . Jeong et al. (2009) found that experimental chickens inoculated with 10 6.5 EID 50 of A/Chicken /Korea/IS/06 (H5N1) can shed a virus from oropharyngeal and cloaca for 3 days at virus titres of 10 4.6 and 10 2.4 TCID 50 /mL, respectively. Other poultry species infected with H5N1 including ducks and quails can shed virus up to 4 and 6 days, respectively at titres of oropharyngeal swabs is 10 3.2 and 10 6.0 TCID 50 /mL, respectively. Pantin-Jackwood & Swayne (2009) demonstrated that Pekin ducks intranasally inoculated with the AI H5N1 virus could shed virus from oral and cloaca at titres of 10 6.5 and 10 3.3 EID 50 , respectively. Interestingly, the results of the present study showed that an individual house fly can uptake the virus in approximately 10 5.43 ELD 50 /mL out of 1 \u00d7 10 9.2 ELD 50 /mL of infectious mixture or approximately 0.02% of the total virus when it was kept at room temperature. Thus, our data suggest that house flies can carry a similar amount of the AI H5N1 virus to the amount of virus shed from H5N1 experimentally infected avian species such as chickens, quails and ducks. However, transmission studies should be performed. In addition, an individual house fly can fly up to 11.8 km within 24 h (Greenberg, 1973) . Therefore, house flies may serve as potential mechanical vectors which spread the AI H5N1 virus to poultry farms in the nearby area similar to blow flies (Calliphora nigribarbis) that was shown to be mechanical vectors for AIV in Japan (Sawabe et al., 2009) .",

(2003) showed that the PRRSV could survive within the intestinal viscera of house flies for up to 12 h post-exposure. Moreover, Watson et al. (2007) found that the NDV remained viable in the crop and gut tissues of the house flies for up to 96 h post-exposure. It should be noted that different results of viable virus remaining in the digestive tract depend on the dimension of anatomy, the type of virus and the route of transmission (F\u00f6rster et al., 2007) . However, the real-time RT-PCR results showed that the viral RNA can be found in all time points of this experiment. In addition, the virus infection titre continuously decreased according to the increasing exposure time. This study found that the AI H5N1 virus could not replicate within the house flies, a mechanical vector rather than a biological vector.",

The results from the present study indicated that house flies may act as a potential mechanical vector for spreading the AI H5N1 virus. As a consequence, improving biosecurity including fly management control should also be considered for the effective control of the AI H5N1 virus in epidemic areas. However, the actual ability of infected house flies in disseminating the AI H5N1 virus to the chicken has not been determined in this study. Therefore, we suggest that the experimental infection with AI H5N1 virus exposed house flies in chickens should be further performed.",
