Using binding and pseudovirus assays, it was shown that Ty-BatCoV HKU4 S, but not Pi-BatCoV HKU5 S, can bind to and use hDPP4 for cell entry [23, 36]. Because phylogenetic analysis placed Hp-BatCoV HKU25-S1 at a position between Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5 in relation to MERS-CoV, it would be interesting to know whether Hp-BatCoV HKU25 may bind to and use hDPP4 for cell entry.

We first tested the binding efficiency of the S1-RBD domains to Huh7 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells with endogenous hDPP4 expression) using flow cytometry. The HKU25-RBD can bind to Huh7 cells, although the observed fluorescence shift was smaller than MERS-RBD (Figure 4A). This indicates that HKU25-RBD can bind to hDPP4-expressing Huh7 cells with lower binding efficiency than that of MERS-RBD. To confirm that the binding is mediated by hDPP4, we obtained Huh7 cells with siRNA knockdown of hDPP4 (confirmed by mRNA expression and Western blot) (Figure 4C). A significant reduction of fluorescence shift was observed in both HKU25-RBD- and MERS-RBD-mediated binding to hDPP4-knockdown Huh7 cells compared with hDPP4-expressing Huh7 cells (Figure 4A). Moreover, HKU25-RBD and MERS-RBD could only bind to HEK293T cells (lacking endogenous hDPP4 expression) after transfection with hDPP4-expressing plasmid, although the binding efficiency to hDPP4-expressing HEK293T cells was lower for HKU25-RBD than MERS-RBD (Figure 4B). Second, we also confirmed the binding of HKU25-RBD to Huh7 cell surface by confocal microscopy (Figure 4D). Third, immunoprecipitation assays showed that hDPP4 protein can be specifically pulled down by both MERS-RBD and HKU25-RBD (Figure 5). These results indicated that HKU25-RBD can bind to hDPP4 on cell surface but with lower efficiency than MERS-CoV-RBD.",

Pseudovirus assays were used because isolation of live Hp-BatCoV HKU25 was not successful, as with most bat CoVs that are often difficult to culture. Retroviruses pseudotyped with luciferase and the respective S proteins were tested for entry to HEK293T cells with or without hDPP4 expression. The MERS-S most robustly mediated pseudovirus entry into hDDP4-expressing HEK293T cells, followed by HKU4-S and HKU25-S, as shown by luciferase activities measured. All 3 pseudoviruses showed a marked increase in luciferase activities in hDDP4-expressing HEK293T cells compared with cells without hDPP4 expression (Figure 6). Moreover, anti-hDPP4 polyclonal antibodies could competitively block HKU25-S, HKU4-S, and MERS-S pseudovirus entry to hDPP4-expresssing HEK293T cells, further confirming the binding specificity. In contrast, HKU5-S and control retroviruses not pseudotyped with S did not mediate pseudovirus entry into hDPP4-expressing HEK293T cells (Figure 6). These results showed that hDPP4 is a possible functional receptor for Hp-BatCoV HKU25, although cell entry may be less efficient than Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and MERS-CoV.",

The sequence identity between HKU25-RBD and MERS-RBD (template) was >50%, and the RBD-hDPP4 interface for all RBDs was similar (Supplementary Figure 5), except that only MERS-RBD and HKU4-RBD possess the extended loop between \u03b26 and \u03b27 involved in interaction with hDPP4 [23]. A negative-charge residue, E536, located in MERS-RBD, corresponding to E541 in HKU4-RBD, can interact with the carbohydrate moiety of hDPP4, whereas HKU5-RBD contains a positive-charge residue, R542, and HKU25-RBD contains an uncharged residue, T540/A541, at the corresponding position. These findings supported that the binding of HKU25-RBD to hDPP4 may be weaker than that of MERS-RBD and HKU4-RBD but stronger than that of HKU5-RBD.",

            "text": "The novel lineage C betacoronavirus, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, helps to fill the evolutionary gap between existing bat viruses and MERS-CoV, and it offers new insights into the evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV. Hp-BatCoV HKU25 shared similar genome features with MERS-CoV, including the conserved ORF4a and ORF4b with predicted domains for double-stranded RNA binding and antagonizing interferon signals, respectively [38, 39]. Phylogenetically, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, together with BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013, was closely related to MERS-CoV and NeoCoV in most genome regions, suggesting that these viruses share a common ancestral origin. Although the S1 of NeoCoV is only distantly related to MERS-CoV, the S1 of Hp-BatCoV HKU25 was at a phylogenetic position closely related to MERS-CoV, only second to Ty-BatCoV HKU4. On the other hand, the S1 of NeoCoV is most closely related to Erinaceus CoV from European hedgehogs. Because NeoCoV was detected in an African bat, it is more likely a recombinant virus between bat and hedgehog CoVs in Africa. Moreover, it was shown that the S of BatCoV PREDICT/PDF-2180, which is closely related to NeoCoV in all genome regions, cannot mediate entry to hDPP4-expressing cells [13]. This further supported that NeoCoV and PREDICT/PDF-2180 are unlikely the immediate ancestors of MERS-CoV. On the other hand, Hp-BatCoV HKU25 and related viruses may represent close relatives to the immediate ancestor of MERS-CoV, based on its phylogenetic position in all genome regions including S protein.",

Using binding and pseudovirus assays, we demonstrated the ability of HKU25-S to bind to and use hDPP4 for cell entry,although with infection efficiency lower than that of MERS-S and HKU4-S. This is not only in line with the phylogenetic position of HKU25-S1 between HKU4-S1 (which can bind to hDPP4) and HKU5-S1 (which cannot), but it is also consistent with findings from structural modeling. Our results suggested that MERS-CoV may have originated from bat viruses having acquired a stepwise increasing ability to bind hDPP4 as they evolved. Previous molecular dating studies estimated that the time of divergence of MERS-CoVs was approximately 2010/2011 [40\u201343]. The present dating results are in line with such estimation, with the tMRCA of MERS-CoVs dated to approximately 2009, and that of MERS-CoV, NeoCoV, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, and BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013 dated to approximately 1939. Therefore, the immediate ancestor of MERS-CoV could well have emerged from bats in the last century through evolution in its S protein before jumping to camels and humans.",

For SARS-CoV, the overlapping habitat and geographical distribution of different horseshoe bats in China is believed to have fostered viral recombination leading to the epidemic. The SARS-CoV is most likely a recombinant virus arising from ancestral viruses in horseshoe bats before it jumped to civet and then humans [44\u201347]. In contrast, there is currently no evidence to suggest that MERS-CoV is a recombinant virus. A previous study suggested that the genetically divergent S1 in NeoCoV may indicate intraspike recombination events involved in the emergence of MERS-CoV [11]. As explained above, NeoCoV, rather than MERS-CoV, is more likely a recombinant virus. On the other hand, a stepwise evolution of the S protein in gaining the ability to use camel and human DPP4 may be an important mechanism for interspecies transmission during the emergence of MERS-CoV.",
