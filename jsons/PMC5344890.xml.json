            "text": "The last few years have dramatically increased our knowledge about viral systematics and evolution. The discoveries of \u201cgiant\u201d viruses (La Scola et al., 2003; Arslan et al., 2011; Philippe et al., 2013; Legendre et al., 2014, 2015) and their virophages (La Scola et al., 2008; Desnues et al., 2012; Gaia et al., 2014; Levasseur et al., 2016) along with accumulation of large-scale protein structure and function data enabled testing hypotheses regarding the origin, classification, and evolution of the viral supergroup. This led to data-driven hypotheses of viral evolution (Koonin et al., 2006; Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015) and new schemes for classifying viruses, different from traditional classification approaches that use genome features (Baltimore, 1971) or host/geographical preferences (King et al., 2012). For example, Bamford and coworkers proposed to define novel viral lineages based on the three-dimensional (3D) structural similarities of major viral capsid/coat proteins and virion assembly pathways (Abrescia et al., 2010). Under this classification, the many known viral families infecting distantly related hosts were pooled into four major viral lineages, the Picornavirus-like lineage, the PRD1/Adenovirus-like lineage, the HK97-like lineage, and the BTV-like lineage (Abrescia et al., 2012). These lineages were mainly described for icosahedral viruses however helical and enveloped viruses are also believed to fall into a limited number of lineages (Abrescia et al., 2012). Interestingly, member viruses of the PRD1/Adenovirus and HK97-like lineages infect species in all three domains of cellular life, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (Woese et al., 1990). Stark differences in membrane composition and cellular biology exist among cellular domains that likely hinder horizontal transfer of viruses between domains of life (Nasir et al., 2014, 2015). Thus, the structural and genetic similarities of viruses infecting the three cellular domains suggest they likely originated prior to the origin of modern diversified cells (Benson et al., 2004; Krupovi\u010d and Bamford, 2008). This scenario is also supported by our recent phylogenomic exploration of the origin of viral and cellular proteomes (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). While the member viruses within a lineage exhibit strong 3D structural similarities in capsid/coat fold architectures (or principles in constructing a functional virion) regardless of the viral replicon (i.e., DNA or RNA) and/or infected host type, the lineages however are believed to be unrelated to each other indicating the polyphyletic origin of viruses (Bamford, 2003).",

This concept is especially applicable to viral capsid proteins as there is strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the overall morphology of the virus particle (Abrescia et al., 2012). Moreover, the capsid is the only feature that distinguishes plasmids, integrated viral genomes, and other \u201cnaked\u201d genetic elements from bona fide viruses (Abrescia et al., 2012). For these reasons, the capsid has been termed the virus \u201cself\u201d (Bamford, 2003) and viruses have been referred to as \u201ccapsid-encoding organisms\u201d (in comparison to ribosome-encoding cellular organisms) (Raoult and Forterre, 2008). The idea is strengthened by the fact that only a limited number of virion morphotypes may be considered geometrically and energetically favorable (Bamford et al., 2005). Indeed, a quick glance of the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database (Andreeva et al., 2008; Fox et al., 2014) reveals only 19 fold superfamilies (FSFs) corresponding to keywords \u201ccapsid\u201d or \u201ccoat\u201d (Table 1). Remarkably, these FSFs are either very rare or completely absent in cellular proteomes (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). These observations identify the capsid as a reliable marker for improving or revising the current taxonomy of viruses. The availability of the SCOP database, a \u201cgold standard\u201d in the structural classification of proteins, and development of algorithms required to scan viral proteins against hidden Markov model (HMM) libraries of known protein structures (Gough et al., 2001; Gough and Chothia, 2002) now enable us to computationally detect the \u201ctype\u201d of capsid fold present in viruses.",

Remarkably, our computational exercise recovered the previously experimentally defined viral lineages along with proposals for new additions, suggesting it could be a reliable supplement to experimental approaches for rapid identification of viral lineages, for example, in metagenomic samples. Accurate assignment of viruses into known lineages will be especially invaluable for novel viruses for which little is known and experimental characterization is technically challenging. Importantly, and despite the great genetic diversity and host biases observed among modern viruses (Nasir et al., 2014; Koonin et al., 2015), virion construction principles appear generally and relatively more conserved in evolution than viral gene sequences or host-associated preferences and present a more viable classification approach for modern viruses (Bamford et al., 2005; Krupovi\u010d and Bamford, 2010, 2011), in addition to providing insights about viral origins and evolution (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015; Forterre, 2016).",

Because, keyword search is directly dependent on how FSFs are described in SCOP (e.g., procapsid), this likely missed several genuine capsid/coat related FSFs. Therefore, we mapped the 17 Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes corresponding to the four experimentally-defined viral lineages (Abrescia et al., 2012) to SCOP 2.05 to get their FSF descriptions. Four PDB entries were not present in SCOP 2.05 (1YUE, 3C5B, 2BBD, and 2VVF) and thus were not considered. The remaining 13 PDB entries corresponded to 8 new FSFs, out of which four (b.121.4, b.19.1, e.28.1, and i.7.1) were new additions to the list (i.e., were not detected earlier by keyword search). The list was further refined by looking for SCOP relatives for each FSF (i.e., other FSFs part of the same fold). As a result, four more FSFs b.121.2, b.121.5, b.121.6, and b.121.7 were added to the list, as SCOP relatives of b.121.4. The final list included 27 FSFs (19 keywords, 4 SCOP relatives, and 4 from Abrescia et al., 2012), out of which 23 were detected in our sampled viral and cellular proteomes (highlighted in boldface in Table 1). Throughout the manuscript, FSFs are named using SCOP concise classification strings (ccs) for quick identification. For example, b.121.4 FSF belongs to SCOP class \u201cb\u201d (i.e., all-beta proteins), fold no. 121, and FSF no. 4 in that fold and class.",

It is the largest defined viral lineage, including members from plus-ssRNA (Bromoviridae, Caliciviridae, Comoviridae, Dicistroviridae, Luteoviridae, Nodaviridae, Picornaviridae, Sequiviridae, Tetraviridae, Tombusviridae, Tymoviridae), dsRNA (Birnaviridae), ssDNA (Microviridae, Parvoviridae), and dsDNA (Papillomaviridae, and Polyomaviridae) viruses but no minus-ssRNA and retrotranscribing viruses, according to (Abrescia et al., 2012).

Thus, our computational approach extended the picornavirus-like lineage to also include minus-ssRNA viruses. Experimental work will be required to confirm if these viruses truly belong to this lineage. Other novel additions included polemoviruses and sobemoviruses (plus-ssRNA viruses that are yet to be assigned to a viral family), eight unclassified plus-ssRNA viruses, Hepeviridae (family of plus-ssRNA viruses that includes the human and avian hepatitis E viruses), Iflaviridae and Marnaviridae (thus completing the detection of all five Picornavirales families in our computational assignments) and one dsDNA virus belonging to Myoviridae (Prochlorococcus phage P-SSM2). Interestingly, Myoviridae possess the so-called \u201cHK97\u201d capsid/coat related fold also seen in eukaryotic Herpesviridae. Together they constitute the HK97-like lineage (read below) and are believed to be unrelated to the picornavirus-like lineage. Thus, assignment of FSF b.121.4 to Myoviridae could either be a false hit or suggests that the two lineages could (in fact) be distantly related. For example, unlike other dsRNA viruses that constitute the BTV-like lineage (read below), Birnaviridae share genomic (Birghan et al., 2000) and structural similarities (Coulibaly et al., 2005) with plus-ssRNA viruses. Based on our assignments, Birnaviridae fall into the picornavirus-like lineage and possess the b.121.4 FSF hallmark of plus-ssRNA viruses. However, the arrangement of the major capsid protein in birnaviruses is similar to the other members of the BTV-like lineage (Abrescia et al., 2012) casting doubts on its accurate affiliation. Perhaps, mixing of ancestral viruses of the picronavirus-like and BTV-like lineages led to modern birnaviruses (Coulibaly et al., 2005) or alternatively represent the evolutionary link between the two lineages.",

It seems that the coat protein of this virus resembles the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d coat proteins of satellite viruses (e.g., Satellite panicum mosaic virus), which harbor a typical \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold but with up to 1\u20132 additional \u03b2-strands (Ban et al., 1995).

The other members of the b.121 fold either include proteins specific to cells (i.e., b.121.1 and b.121.3) or advanced forms of the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d (b.121.2) that make a lineage of their own (read below). Importantly, the picornavirus-like lineage now includes viruses with all replicon types except two groups of retrotranscribing viruses and supports the idea that viruses with different replicons can share strong structural and molecular properties (Bamford, 2003). The exercise also revealed that structural relatives of the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold are found in cells (e.g., histone chaperones and metabolic folds Dutta et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2002; Cheng and Brooks, 2013) and thus it may not be a unique viral hallmark. However, none of the five putative picornavirus-like lineage associated FSFs (a.84.1, b.121.4, b.121.5, b.121.6, and b.121.7) were detected in any of the archaeal proteomes while b.121.4 was detected in roughly 1% of bacterial and 12% of eukaryotic proteomes, and b.121.6 in only 4% of eukaryotic proteomes indicating rare presence in cellular proteomes (Table 1). These rare occurrences could (possibly) be episodes of virus-to-cell horizontal gene transfer (HGT) during infection (Akita et al., 2007; Sutter et al., 2008). Indeed, b.121.4, a hallmark of plus-sense RNA viruses, was relatively widespread among eukaryotes (12% spread) consistent with previous knowledge that RNA viral infections are common in eukaryotic species but absent in Archaea and extremely rare in Bacteria (Nasir et al., 2014, 2015; Koonin et al., 2015). Importantly, the host range of the picornavirus-like lineage is apparently restricted to Bacteria and Eukarya (not accounting for Myoviridae that also infects Archaea) and 100% of the viral families listed in (Abrescia et al., 2012) were detected along with several new novel additions indicating the success of our computational survey.",

The prototype members include the human adenoviruses (Adenoviridae), Paramecium bursaria chlorella viruses (Phycodnaviridae), the Bacteriophage PRD1 (Tectiviridae), and the archaeal Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (Turriviridae). The lineage is characterized by the \u201cdouble jelly-roll\u201d fold, which likely formed by the duplication of the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold (Krupovi\u010d and Bamford, 2011). However, the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d and \u201cdouble jelly-roll\u201d folds are utilized differently in assembling capsids and hence form two distinct lineages (Krupovi\u010d and Bamford, 2011). Capsids of viruses belonging to the PRD1/Adenovirus lineage are assembled in trimers consisting of two \u03b2-barrels arranged around a pseudo six-fold axis. The \u201cdouble \u03b2-barrel\u201d fold corresponds to \u201cGroup II dsDNA viruses VP\u201d FSF (b.121.2) (Figure 1) and was detected in Adenoviridae, Asco/Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, Marseilleviridae, Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Tectiviridae, and two unclassified dsDNA viruses (Micromonas pusilla virus 12T and Ostreococcus lucimarinus virus OlV5). Notable exceptions from (Abrescia et al., 2012) were of Poxviridae, Corticoviridae, and Turriviridae. However, the \u201cdouble \u03b2-barrel\u201d protein domain in poxviruses only facilitates virion formation and does not become part of the capsid. In turn, the corresponding PDB entries (2BBD and 2VVF) for Turriviridae and Corticoviridae (identified from Abrescia et al., 2012) were not part of SCOP and were thus missed by SCOP-based SUPERFAMILY HMMs (Gough et al., 2001; Gough and Chothia, 2002). Thus, their absence is likely not due to failure of our approach but due to incomplete coverage of PDB in SCOP. New additions of Asco/Asfarviridae and Mimiviridae were confirmed independently (Krupovi\u010d and Bamford, 2011). The \u201cdouble \u03b2-barrel\u201d is apparently a virus hallmark and was detected in only 1% of eukaryotic proteomes (Table 1), suggesting it was likely acquired in the few cellular proteomes from their viruses by HGT.",

            "text": "The HK97-like lineage includes tailed viruses belonging to archaeal and bacterial Caudovirales (Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae) and the eukaryotic Herpesviridae (Figure 2). The HK97 fold corresponds to two major FSFs, the \u201cMajor capsid protein gp5\u201d (d.183.1) from Bacteriophage HK97 and the \u201cMajor capsid protein VP5\u201d (e.48.1) from Herpes simplex virus 1 (Figure 1). It has been verified that the \u201cfloor\u201d domain of herpesvirus VP5 and HK97 gp5 have similar structural organization and are evolutionarily related (Baker et al., 2005). Moreover, a small tail similar to that of Podoviridae has been detected in the herpesvirus capsid, further supporting their inclusion in the HK97-like lineage (Schmid et al., 2012). In addition, the \u201cHead decoration protein D\u201d (gpD, major capsid protein D) FSF (b.85.2) was also detected exclusively in Siphoviridae and one unclassified Caudovirales (Providencia phage Redjac). The b.85.2 is a \u201cbeta-clip\u201d fold that forms an incomplete barrel somewhat similar to the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d structure (Figure 1). Its main function is to decorate the head shell and stabilize the capsid (Yang et al., 2000). There were no additional SCOP relatives for either d.183.1 or e.48.1, the two major markers for the HK97-like lineage. However, b.85.2 had six SCOP relatives: (i) \u201cAFP III-like domain\u201d (b.85.1), a type of antifreezing protein possessing a compact fold composed of beta-strands (Davies et al., 2002) (found in cells but not detected in any virus) (ii) \u201cUrease, beta-subunit\u201d (b.85.3), a subunit of urease enzyme known to hydrolyze urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia (Takishima et al., 1988) (again detected in cells but not in any virus) (iii) \u201cdUTPase-like\u201d (b.85.4), a metabolic enzyme near-universal in cells and also detected in a wide array of viruses, (iv) \u201cTlp20, baculovirus telokin-like protein\u201d (b.85.5), a virus-specific protein of unknown function expressed late in baculoviruses (Raynes et al., 1994), (v) \u201cMoeA C-terminal domain-like\u201d (b.85.6), a widespread protein in cells (but not in viruses) that is involved in molybdopterin cofactor synthesis (Xiang et al., 2001), and (vi) the \u201cSET domain\u201d (b.85.7) found in both cells and viruses and involved in a range of metabolic and transport processes. The wide distribution of b.85 fold in cellular proteins (and its association with cell-related processes) suggests this fold was co-opted numerous times in evolution. Perhaps, its unique presence in some viral proteins (i.e., b.85.2 and b.85.4) could be due to convergent evolution. FSF b.85.2 however was exclusively detected in Caudovirales and was completely absent in Archaea and Eukarya (0%) and only detected in 8 out of 1,115 sampled bacterial proteomes (0.72%) (Table 1) suggesting it could still supplement HK97-like lineage characterization together with d.183.1 and e.48.1 FSFs. Interestingly, however, d.183.1 was highly abundant in bacterial proteomes (32%) (Table 1) indicating either widespread bacteriophage mediated gene transfer (Canchaya et al., 2003) or possibly relics of ancient co-existence of viruses in primordial cells (Nasir et al., 2012; Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). Indeed, the HK97-like lineage is the second lineage after the PRD1/Adenovirus lineage that includes viral members infecting all three cellular domains of life (Abrescia et al., 2012) suggesting it originated prior to (or concurrently with) the diversification of cellular life (Bamford, 2003; Benson et al., 2004).",

            "text": "This lineage included three families of dsRNA viruses, Cystoviridae, Reoviridae, and Totiviridae (Abrescia et al., 2012). Members of these families encode both an outer and inner capsid core. The inner core is evolutionarily conserved and is required within the host cell to avoid apoptotic response against foreign dsRNA genomes (Grimes et al., 1998). The major core protein VP3, which forms the inner shell of the Bluetongue virus capsid, characterizes this lineage. About 120 monomers of VP3 are packed with icosahedral symmetry following a rather unique pattern of subunit assembly. This arrangement was also detected in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A (Totiviridae) (Cast\u00f3n et al., 1997) and Pseudomonas phage phi 6 (Cystoviridae) viruses (Huiskonen et al., 2006) suggesting the architecture may be unique to dsRNA viruses (Abrescia et al., 2012). VP3 is a multidomain protein containing different FSFs (Figure 1). We discovered that \u201cA virus capsid protein alpha-helical domain\u201d (a.115.1), \u201cReovirus inner layer core protein p3\u201d (e.28.1), and \u201cL-A virus major coat protein\u201d (e.42.1) FSFs likely correspond to VP3-like architectures, while the \u201cOuter capsid protein sigma 3\u201d FSF (d.196.1) was associated with the outer core of the Reoviridae capsid. These FSFs were detected in the members of Reoviridae and Totiviridae (but not Cystoviridae). Birnaviruses, which also encode a dsRNA genome, were classified in the picornavirus-like lineage because current knowledge dictates that they exhibit stronger affinity with the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold harboring viruses (Abrescia et al., 2010). Another capsid/coat related FSF detected in Reoviridae is the \u201cViral protein domain\u201d (b.19.1). This protein is part of capsids in Reoviridae (Grimes et al., 1995; Mathieu et al., 2001; VP6 and VP7 Basak et al., 1996) but is also present in minus-ssRNA (Orthomyxoviridae) (Rosenthal et al., 1998; Ha et al., 2002) and plus-ssRNA (members of Nidovirales) viruses. Structurally, the domain exhibits similarity to the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold. Thus, \u201cjelly-roll\u201d-like fold structures are seen in each of the four major structural lineages and also in some cellular proteins. Consistent with the signature folds of the PRD1/Adenovirus and HK97-like lineages, none of the five FSFs described here (a.115.1, e.28.1, e.42.1, d.196.1, and b.19.1) had any SCOP relatives and their presence in cellular proteomes was near negligible (Table 1). The host range of the BTV-like lineage is restricted to eukaryotic organisms (Table 2).",

            "text": "The ssRNA-RT (Retroviridae) and dsDNA-RT (Caulimoviridae and Hepadnaviridae) (Figure 3) viruses were not part of any of the four lineages in either (Abrescia et al., 2012) or our initial assignments (see above). Retrotranscribing viruses are typically enveloped and their proteins are difficult to crystalize for structural studies. The capsid protein fold from Retroviridae contains an N-terminal domain (5-helix bundle) involved in core formation and a C-terminal domain (4-helix bundle) involved in capsid dimerization (Jin et al., 1999; Campos-Olivas et al., 2000). These domains correspond to the \u201cRetrovirus capsid protein, N-terminal core domain\u201d (a.73.1) and the \u201cRetrovirus capsid dimerization domain-like\u201d (a.28.3) FSFs (Figure 4) and were detected in many viruses belonging to Retroviridae (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency virus-1). In contrast, the capsid fold from Hepadnaviridae (e.g., Hepatitis B virus) is also helical (5-helices) and obeys a T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. This fold corresponds to the \u201cHepatitis B viral capsid (hbcag)\u201d FSF (a.62.1) (Figure 4) and was detected in members of Hepadnaviridae. It has been hypothesized that the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid protein shows significant similarities to the HBV capsid protein suggesting that the two lineages could be evolutionarily related (Zlotnick et al., 1998). We note that the capsid fold of Hepadnaviridae is arranged in an array-like structure where two long helices form a hairpin that dimerizes into a 4-helical bundle closely resembling the 4-helical bundle of Retroviridae capsid (a.28.3). However, retroviral FSFs (a.28.3 and a.73.1) did not group with the capsid FSF from Hepadnaviridae (a.62.1) according to SCOP classification. Search against the DALI server (Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010) also failed to detect any apparent structural homology between the two domains (Wynne et al., 1999). Therefore, more work is required to establish if the capsids from retrotranscribing viruses form independent lineages or just one (i.e., Retrotranscribing-like lineage?). However, capsids from both Retroviridae and Hepadnaviridae are helical and this is in sharp contrast to the \u03b2-sheet rich capsids typically found in other lineages. While the Hepadnaviridae a.62.1 FSF was completely absent in all cellular proteomes, the two Retroviridae FSFs (a.28.3 and a.73.1) were exclusively detected in 17 and 5% eukaryotic proteomes but none of the prokaryotic proteomes (Table 1). Again, virus-to-cell HGT cannot be ruled out considering retrotranscribing viruses are hitherto unknown to infect prokaryotes (Nasir et al., 2014, 2015; Koonin et al., 2015). Both a.62.1 and a.73.1 had no additional SCOP relatives. FSF a.28.3 had two additional relatives: (i) \u201cACP-like\u201d (a.28.1), and (ii) \u201cColicin E immunity proteins\u201d (a.28.2), the former detected both in cells and viruses while the latter only in Bacteria. Because the three FSFs are unique to retrotranscribing viruses, they can serve as useful markers to fish retrotranscribing viruses from virome metagenome samples. Other enveloped viruses such as Flaviviridae are also hard to classify based on core capsid proteins. The virions of Flaviviruses are composed of three proteins, C, E, and M (Figure 3). The aggregation of C protein forms the nucleocapsid, which encloses the plus-ssRNA genome of flaviviruses. This protein belongs to the \u201cFlavivirus capsid protein C\u201d FSF (a.190.1, the sole member of the fold) that was not detected in any other family besides Flaviviridae or in any of the sampled cellular proteomes (Table 1, Figure 4) again indicating its reliability in characterizing viruses. However, there is indication that instead of the nucleocapsid core, surface glycoproteins involved in membrane fusion may be more similar to other enveloped viruses and could be better markers for taxonomy characterization (Abrescia et al., 2012).",

            "text": "In addition to the FSFs described above that were benchmarked against previous work (Abrescia et al., 2012), several other capsid/coat related FSFs unique to some viral families were also detected. For example, another candidate for novel viral lineage could be the \u201cRNA bacteriophage capsid protein\u201d FSF (d.85.1) (Figure 4) that was detected in several RNA viruses of bacteria (Leviviridae) (Figure 3). Structurally, the d.85.1 FSF is composed of 6-stranded \u03b2-sheet followed by two \u03b1-helices. It was not detected in any other viral family beside Leviviridae (and only in 0.26% eukaryotic proteomes) and thus could be used to characterize Leviviruses (Leviviridae-like lineage? also speculated to be a new lineage by Abrescia et al., 2012). Similarly, the \u201cNucleocapsid protein dimerization domain\u201d FSF (d.254.1) was detected in Coronoviridae and Arteriviridae, belonging to viral order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) and in none of the cellular proteomes. Coronoviridae and Arteriviridae are common pathogens of animals and humans (e.g., SARS). Structurally, the domain is composed of a dimer of mixed \u03b1 and \u03b2 secondary structures (Figure 4). This FSF could therefore be used as bait to fish out additional members of Nidovirales, especially useful in quick identification of re-emergence of known coronaviruses. In turn, FSF b.37.1 represents the N-terminal domains (N1 and N2) of the gp3 minor coat protein of ssDNA bacteriophages belonging to Inoviridae. Structurally, the domain resembles the \u03b2-barrel fold and is primarily involved in phage infection of E. coli. Another domain detected exclusively in Inoviridae is the \u201cInovirus (filamentous phage) major coat protein\u201d FSF (h.1.4), which exhibits a \u201cpseudo-fold\u201d comprising of oligomers of short identical \u03b1-helices (Figure 4). Together, the major and minor coat proteins (negligible presence in cellular proteomes, Table 1) can perhaps characterize inoviruses (i.e., Inovirus-like lineage?). Finally, \u201cTMV-like viral coat proteins\u201d FSF (a.24.5) was detected in several plus-ssRNA viruses of plants that exhibit \u201clinear\u201d morphology (e.g., Benyviruses, Potyviridae, and Virgaviridae). Structurally, the domain is described as a 4-helical bundle by SCOP (Figure 4). Interestingly, the major capsid proteins of archaeal linear viruses (Lipothrixiviridae and Rudiviridae) are also characterized by unique 4-helix bundles at their C-terminus. However, the arrangement of helices between Virgaviridae and archaeal viruses differs along with other genomic differences (Prangishvili and Krupovic, 2012; Nasir et al., 2015) suggesting perhaps that archaeal linear viruses evolved independently from bacterial and eukaryal linear viruses.",

FSF i.14.1 is the low-resolution protein structure of \u201cBacteriophage HK97 procapsid (prohead II),\u201d as defined by SCOP. Thus, it could be pooled along with other FSFs that define the HK97-like viral lineage, albeit with caution.

Whereas, j.9.7 is the \u201cIlarvirus coat protein N-terminal fragment\u201d of Alfalfa mosaic virus YSMV (plus-ssRNA, Bromoviridae).

These proteins were broadly defined as \u201cviral protein detected in the virion\u201d and included several capsid, envelope, matrix, and tegument proteins in addition to proteins directly involved in capsid assembly and virion formation. The list also included several proteins that are packaged into viral capsids for successful replication of viral replicon inside cells, such as the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase of minus-ssRNA viruses and enzymes responsible for host cell membrane degradation during virus entry. These proteins therefore broadly point to an interesting set of proteins that are related to virions of viruses but not necessarily relevant for viral taxonomy. This is showcased by the fact that a total of 164 FSFs were detected in these proteins indicating the diversity and breadth of the biological process of virion synthesis (Table S1). A total of 22 (out of 23, with the exclusion of the bacteriophage procapsid FSF a.84.1) FSFs detected in our sampled proteomes (Table 1) were part of the list including FSFs b.121.4 and b.121.6 (picornavirus-like lineage), b.19.1 (BTV-like lineage), and a.73.1 and a.28.3 (retrotranscribing-like lineage?) with more than 100 hits and FSF b.121.2 (PRD1/Adenovirus-like lineage) with 92 hits (Table S1). In addition, the list included several ancient and widespread protein folds such as the P-loop containing NTP hydrolase and SAM-dependent methyltransferases, among other proteins, that were (near)-universal in cellular proteomes. In fact, 30 and 57 of these FSFs were detected in >95% prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes, respectively, indicating a similar use of 3D structural designs in cellular organisms, perhaps for processes other than virion synthesis or revealing a strong link to the co-existence of viral and cellular ancestors (Nasir et al., 2012, 2015; Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). Despite a significant number of mostly cellular proteins that share structural similarities to steps involved in capsid assembly and virion synthesis, the paucity of capsid-like shells in cells however remains surprising (read below).",

Only very few members were missing. This could be a result of using a stringent criterion in assigning FSFs to viral proteins (i.e., E < 0.0001) or alternatively absence of corresponding entries of the RCSB PDB database (Rose et al., 2015) in SCOP. Importantly, results show that viruses with different replicons and proteome histories have capsids that are structurally very similar and that HMM-based assignment (Gough et al., 2001; Gough and Chothia, 2002) reproduced the well-known viral lineages. Moreover, only a limited number of unique capsid/coat related structures (n = 23), mostly unique to a particular viral family or group, exist in the virosphere that can characterize viruses belonging to 4\u20138 known groups (Table 1). Because the discovery of unique protein folds has slowed down considerably in the past five years (e.g., 1,195 folds in SCOP 1.75 updated 2009 vs. 1,208 folds in SCOP 2.05 updated February 2015), we speculate that the 27 capsid/coat related viral protein folds identified in our study is not far from the true diversity of virion structural components in nature. The recent drive in metagenome and virome sequencing will no doubt aid in isolating new viruses harboring novel capsid/coat related folds. However, based on the observation that capsid/coat proteins repeat in viruses, we speculate that between 12 and 15 viral lineages exist in nature and the real number is likely closer to the lower bound. Remarkably, the majority of virus capsid/coat-related FSFs are either completely absent or rare in cellular organisms with exceptions likely representing virus-to-cell HGT (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). These observations identify the capsid structure as a useful marker for defining viruses, functionally analogous and effective as 16S rRNA for the detection of prokaryotic DNA/RNA in metagenome samples.",

            "text": "Three limitations of the computational approach however must be noted: First, some capsid/coat protein folds characterize large groups of viruses (e.g., several plus-ssRNA virus families characterized by the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold) indicating low resolution in pinpointing the quantity and nature of viruses present in samples, while the others are unique to one family (e.g., Leviviridae or retro-transcribing viruses) thus indicating significant utility in recognizing specific viral groups. Thus, the quality of analysis is expected to vary from sample to sample. Second, only a qualitative assessment of viral diversity (e.g., whether retro-transcribing viruses are likely to be present in samples or not?) seems possible utilizing capsid as taxonomic marker. This is however still cheaper than either shotgun sequencing of all nucleic acids present in metagenome samples or a hybridization-capture approach of pulling down nucleic acids homologous to known viruses (Wylie et al., 2015). Both approaches are cost-prohibitive for large number of samples simply because viruses possess replicons of at least seven types and exhibit high levels of sequence polymorphisms. Third, morphological similarities in viruses can also result from convergent evolution, especially because there are only a limited number of \u201ceconomical\u201d ways to pack viral genomes. These arguments have been discussed elsewhere and were considered to be less likely (Abrescia et al., 2012). For example, in addition to sharing the same capsid fold in similar arrangement, some viral lineages also share common ATPases that package the viral genome into the capsid. Thus, additional properties favor vertical inheritance of the well-defined lineages (Abrescia et al., 2012). Moreover, protein domains grouped into common FSFs are recognized by the existence of a conserved backbone formed by unique interactions between amino acid side chains. The odds of originating the same backbone independently and multiple times in evolution are considered to be very small (0.4\u20134% in Gough, 2005) indicating convergence an exception and divergence the rule when evaluating similarities in structures (Abrescia et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the four new candidate structure-based lineages proposed by our study should be considered putative since vertical origin of member viruses within these new lineages remains to be established. However, because FSFs identified by our study are exclusive to viral families described, they are still invaluable markers for recognition of viral families present in unknown samples (e.g., retrovirus identification via three marker FSFs, Figure 4). Importantly, the presence of an FSF is not the sole criterion to classify a viral family into a lineage. It needs to be supported by the use of the capsid fold in similar organization and other genomic evidence (where available). Thus, it is important to consider both structural (capsid) and non-structural (polymerases and hydrolases) proteins when studying viral evolution (e.g., in Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015).",

            "text": "Viral capsid-like architectures are relatively rare in cells. Cheng and Brooks III recently calculated distances of structural relatives of viral capsid proteins to capsid-like proteins in cells for a large number of folds (Cheng and Brooks, 2013). Using a stringent criterion (distance < 0.4), they concluded that the majority of capsid-like cellular proteins possessed variants of the \u201cjelly-roll\u201d fold and that these proteins were part of multi-domain proteins, which likely restricted their assembly into capsid-like structures (Cheng and Brooks, 2013). Notable exceptions however are of bacterial carboxysomes that show morphological resemblance to viral capsids but utilize folds not detected in extant viral proteomes (Yeates et al., 2007, 2011) and archaeal protein nanocompartments that store metabolic enzymes and utilize protein fold exhibiting strong homology to the HK97 fold (Sutter et al., 2008). One obvious shortcoming is the lack of classification for enveloped viruses, lack of viral representatives in the RCSB PDB database, and current biases toward sequencing economically and industrially important viruses (Delwart, 2013). These shortcomings however will naturally be overcome with the completion of ongoing and planned (meta)-genome sequencing projects. We expect that increased sequencing of novel viruses, from atypical habitats and hosts, a logical outcome of recent trends toward metagenomics and environmental sampling, can considerably bridge this gap in the near future. We therefore conclude that while the proposal of capsid structure-based viral classification seems promising, more work is required to establish boundaries within the virosphere. Remarkably, the HMM-based computational exercise impressively complements the experimental-based research and can be used to quickly determine the nature of newly discovered viruses and will aid in the qualitative assessment of viral diversity in metagenome samples.",
