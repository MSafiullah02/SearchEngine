            "text": "\nAsymmetric reconstructionReconstruction without icosahedral or any other symmetry enforcement.Charge-coupled device (CCD)The CCD used in a transmission electron microscope is composed of a scintillator on top of an array of photon-sensitive pixels. Electrons that hit the scintillator produce a cascade of photons that are recorded as charge on each of the pixels. This pattern of charge (effectively the image) is then read from the array and digitally stored.Common linesThis approach for particle alignment relies on the fact that the Fourier transform of a real space projection of a 3-D object is effectively the same as a 2-D slice in Fourier space passing through the origin of the 3-D Fourier transform of the object. As such, any two real-space projections will intersect along a line (the common line) in Fourier space. Every icosahedral particle has 37 self-common lines and these can be used to determine the icosahedral orientations of a set of particles on a per particle basis. As self-common lines are computed for projections of the same particle, this process is highly sensitive to the preserved icosahedral symmetry of a particle, and noise present in each single particle image. Similar to self-common lines are cross common lines which are described for a pair of particles as opposed to just a single particle, making it possible to define a maximum of 60 cross common lines for any two icosahedral particles. Cross common line-based particle orientation refinement is advantageous because the magnitude of possible cross common lines reduces the detrimental effect noise has in the self-common lines approach.Conformational heterogeneityStructural non-uniformity of a specimen due to biological or biochemical attributes.Contrast transfer function (CTF)The CTF is a function that characterizes the electron optics used to form an image in a transmission electron microscope. It distorts the image due to defocus, astigmatism, and spherical aberration of the objective lens.Cryo-electron microscopeAn electron microscope equipped with a specimen holder specifically designed to keep the specimen in the column at temperatures below that of liquid nitrogen.Cryo-electron Tomography (Cryo-ET)The process whereby a frozen, hydrated sample is imaged at a series of tilt angles, and the images are then used to reconstruct a 3-D volume.Cryo-electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)Refers to the method of imaging a frozen, hydrated specimen kept below liquid nitrogen temperatures in an electron microscope and reconstructing the 3-D density map from multiple single images through computer processing.Cryo-ETRefers to recording images of the same area of a frozen, hydrated specimen at multiple angles of tilt and reconstructing the 3-D density map from these images (a tilt series).Eucentric heightThe position/height of the sample in an electron microscope column at which little or no shift is noted in the collected images while tilting the sample for tomography.Fiducial markerAny object that is used to relate the relative position of one image to the next (often used to facilitate alignment and reconstruction of a tomogram).Icosahedral particle (icosahedron)A polygon with 60 asymmetric units that are related by five-, three-, and twofold axes of symmetry.Inelastically scatteredAn interaction between the sample and the electrons used in imaging that results in the loss of energy from the electrons.NyquistRefers to the maximum resolution retrievable in digital imaging that is twice the sampling interval. For example, if the sampling interval were 2 \u00c5 per pixel for a given image, Nyquist would be 4 \u00c5.Objective lensThe lens system in an electron microscope that sits immediately below the sample in the column. This is the lens responsible for forming the first image of the sample.Particle orientationThe individual viruses imaged via cryo-EM and cryo-ET can be related to each other through their orientations. A three-coordinate system of the Euler angles (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) is typically used to define particle orientations. Once particle orientations are determined (typically during alignment or refinement), it is possible to reconstruct the 3-D density map.Power spectrumA Fourier intensity representation of a function that can be 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D.Protein Data Bank (PDB)A public repository for atomic models of proteins and nucleic acids determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and/or cryo-EM.ReconstructionThe production of a 3-D density map from a set of images of particles in different orientations (either cryo-EM or cryo-ET).ResolutionA metric referring to the smallest discernable separation between objects seen in an image or reconstruction. The method of assessing resolution in single particle cryo-EM is based on a numerical threshold in the Fourier shell correlation of two reconstructions computed from two independent sets of raw particle images.Secondary structure elementsRefers to the \u03b1 helices and \u03b2 sheets in a protein.Signal-to-noise ratioA measure of the level of noise in a measurement. This value is computed as the ratio of the signal intensity to the noise intensity.SubtomogramA subvolume of data computationally extracted from a complete tomogram.\n",

            "text": "Human infectious disease is classified into five etiologies: bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal, and prion. Viral infections are unique in that they recruit human cellular machinery to replicate themselves and spread infection. The number of viruses causing human disease is vast, and viruses can be broadly categorized by their structures. Many viruses, such as influenza, appear to be amorphous particles, whereas others, such as herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, dengue virus, and adenovirus, have roughly symmetric structural components. Icosahedral viruses have been a target of electron microscopists for years, and they were some of the first objects to be reconstructed three-dimensionally from electron micrographs.[1], [2] The ease with which highly purified and conformationally uniform virus samples can be produced makes them an ideal target for structural studies. Apart from their biological significance, these virus samples have played a pivotal role in the development of new methodologies in the field of molecular biology as well as in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).",

Furthermore, near-atomic resolution reconstructions, although not as routine, are starting to make their way into the literature.[3], [11], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] Apart from icosahedral reconstructions, a growing trend in the field of cryo-EM is the reconstruction of viruses with no imposed symmetry, allowing for the identification and interpretation of non-icosahedral components of the virus (e.g., the tail and the portal complex).[6], [12], [17], [13], [14], [15], [16] Although asymmetric reconstruction is the ideal approach of any cryo-EM study, the resolution of these reconstructions has yet to reach the point where assignment of secondary structural features is definitive.",

The major difference between the two techniques is the manner in which the data are recorded. In single particle data collection, individual virus particles on the grid are imaged only once, and it is the collection of thousands of these images that is used to reconstruct the virus (Figure 2\n). In cryo-ET, a single area of a grid containing many viral particles is imaged multiple times, at a variety of tilt angles, and it is the combination of these images that is used to generate a tomogram and subsequently an averaged density map (Figure 3\n). Although single particle data collection is often used for subnanometer resolution structural studies, in the case in which either structural or conformational non-uniformity exists (e.g., viral infection of a cell), tomography proves a more fruitful endeavor. Regardless of the technique used, implicit in each of these techniques is the need to process the raw data, and although the means of doing so are quite unique, the basic principle of aligning and averaging the data remains the same.",

Because cryo-EM provides a projection of the virus onto the recording medium, the lack of an even distribution in the 3-D orientation of the particles can introduce bias when reconstructing the data. Accordingly, a single particle imaging session should result in the collection of a series of 2-D images that taken together offer a well-sampled view of the many different orientations of the particles. The process of single particle reconstruction involves isolating each viral particle from a set of images, determining its orientation and center, and then using this information to stitch the data back together into a single 3-D representation of the virus.",

In the presence of structurally diverse samples, a technique that can capitalize on the information content of just a few particles of similar or identical conformation is needed. The theory behind tomography is that by collecting a series of images from a sample, at a variety of tilt angles, it is possible to reconstruct a 3-D volume density from the 2-D projections (Figure 3(a)).[23], [24] This approach allows for a great deal of low-resolution 3-D information to be extracted from the handful of particles in the tomogram. Under standard tomographic imaging conditions, a series of 71 images are taken from \u221270\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 at a step size of 2\u00b0 (60\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 tilt holders are available as well). These images can then be aligned to each other using fiducial markers present in the images (Figure 3(b)), from which a volume (a tomogram) can be extracted (Figure 3(c)).25 From this volume, it is possible to extract individual subtomograms corresponding to each of the particles. These subtomograms can then be classified, aligned, and averaged to obtain a single 3-D model.[26], [28], [27]\n",

In single particle data collection, the sample is often subjected to between 20 and 25 electrons per \u00c52 per micrograph.[20], [29] In tomography, however, because a single area of the grid is imaged approximately 70 times, the sample is subjected to far more radiation, making damage a consideration. In general, during tomography, the dose per image is set to a point at which the total dose per tomogram (71 images) is between 80 and 100 electrons per \u00c52.27 Even at this dose level, radiation damage begins to become an issue and will limit the maximum achievable resolution through this technique.[30], [31] Therefore, in order to limit the total dose delivered in a single tomogram, on average, the dose per image must be reduced to nearly 1/20th of what is commonly used for a single particle micrograph. Lowering the total dose per image reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the data and effectively lowers the maximum attainable resolution from the data, the gain from \u2018dose fractionation\u2019 notwithstanding.32 Due to the manner in which a single tomographic series is recorded, the maximum resolution achieved so far with these techniques only approaches the nanometer threshold,33 which is far below the current standard set by the single particle approach.[4], [11], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]\n",

For the purpose of virus reconstruction, the two most commonly used voltages are 200 and 300 kV. The major differences between these two voltages concern contrast and depth of field. Although the 200-kV microscope has slightly better contrast, it has a smaller depth of field. Contrast is less of an issue for viruses, but the differences in depth of field between the two voltages become a consideration for large viruses where the top and bottom of the virus particles are no longer at the same defocus.21 For these reasons, 300-kV electron microscopes are the instrument of choice for high-resolution structural studies.",

To reconstruct an unknown virus from low to high resolution, it is necessary to collect the data at varying defocus (Figure 4\n) so that the merged images will have no information gap up to the targeted resolution of the reconstruction. Because the apparent image contrast is higher at higher defocus, high-defocus/high-contrast images are ideal for building an initial model for a reconstruction because the data contain low-resolution details. However, the usefulness of these high-defocus images is limited by the fact that for some instruments, at high defocus, the SNR rapidly decreases with increasing spatial frequency (Figure 4(d)) due to the spatial coherence of the electron gun. As a result, the same images used to determine an initial model are generally not ideal for high-resolution reconstructions because they have less signal at high spatial frequencies. Traditionally, viruses were imaged at a large defocus (>3 \u03bcm), optimized for good low-resolution contrast, which made it possible for image processing software of the time to determine the orientations of the particles for the purpose of reconstruction.[36], [37] High-resolution virus studies relied on focal pair series that coupled two images from the same area of a grid, one at high defocus to determine the approximate icosahedral orientations and another close to focus to maximize high-resolution information content.[29], [38] However, because the microcsope's spatial coherence and image processing software have improved, it is no longer necessary to image far from focus, and on average, for data collected on a 300-kV electron microscope, the defocus range used today for a typical high-resolution reconstruction varies from 0.5 to 2.5 \u03bcm.",

However, to address the issues of poor contrast in the transmitted electron beam, while preserving high-resolution features, energy filtering has been implemented in the workflow of data collection.[39], [40] By filtering the transmitted beam, it is possible to exclude electrons that were inelastically scattered by the sample, thus enhancing the contrast of the resulting image, especially at low defocus (Figure 5\n). Energy filters are becoming more commonplace in cryo-EM, and they have been used to solve structures at resolutions of approximately 4 \u00c5.[5], [10], [41]\n",

Not long ago, photographic film was the only medium for data collection, but advances in fabrication techniques have resulted in the development of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) capable of recording images from electron microscopes. Due to improvements in the scintillators used on the new generation of CCD cameras, CCDs have started to replace film as the preferred medium for data collection, even for near-atomic resolution reconstructions.[9], [11], [42], [43] Inherently, CCDs have many advantages compared to photographic film; some of the most notable advantages are high contrast at low frequency, instantaneous assessment of data quality, and elimination of the labor-intensive process of film development and digitization. Like any recording medium, CCD cameras have their own modulation transfer function, and it is possible to empirically determine the retrievable resolution of these devices by estimating the frequency at which the SNR in images of amorphous carbon falls below 5% (Figure 6\n). Previous work has shown that depending on the CCD used, the achievable resolution for these devices ranges between 2/5 and 2/3 Nyquist frequency.[42], [44] Determining the achievable resolution limit of a CCD is necessary because it dictates at what magnification data should be collected when targeting a specific resolution for a reconstruction.",

Although a digitized film negative requires approximately 100 MB to store (assuming a 9-\u03bcm per pixel resolution), the raw data (the negative) can be stored indefinitely in a low-humidity, light-free environment. Alternatively, data from a CCD exist solely as a digital file and must be maintained as such. The data storage requirements of a single micrograph collected on CCD depend directly on the size of the CCD. The first CCDs used for biological applications were 1-megapixel (MP) cameras that required 4 MB of storage per frame.[45], [46] These were followed by 4-MP,47 16-MP,[44], [48] and 100-MP cameras requiring 16, 64, and 480 MB of storage per frame, respectively. Although the cost of data storage is relatively low (currently less than $0.10 per GB), a single session on the microscope can result in the collection of between 26 and 192 GB, depending on the CCD camera used and the number of images collected. One effect of this growing trend toward higher megapixel CCDs is the nearly exponential growth in stored data. Fortunately, data storage capabilities have grown exponentially during approximately the past decade, making it possible to store all of these data. Nevertheless, as higher resolution reconstructions are sought, the amount of data storage required for these reconstructions may exceed local resources. Although the cost of digital collection and short-term storage is far less than that of film development, the need to maintain the data electronically with a high level of fidelity for an indefinite amount of time reinforces the need for a local centralized electronic database for electron micrographs.",

By excluding obviously bad images from the reconstruction, one can reduce the number of particles that could otherwise yield confounding or perhaps erroneous results.

The only parameters under control during the boxing process are the box size with which the individual particles are boxed and the position of these boxes with respect to particles they \u2018box.\u2019 It is important to note that an adequate box size in addition to reasonable box centering about the particle is required for reconstruction. Furthermore, care must be taken in choosing the desired box size because a box that is just a single pixel smaller or larger than optimal can have a dramatic effect on the speed with which the data are processed. In general, the box size is set to be approximately 1.5 to 1.75 times the size of the particle so as to ensure that there is adequate background in the box to generate a noise profile for each particle for accurate CTF correction, alignment, and refinement. Programs are available (e.g., EMAN and EMAN2) that simplify this process by allowing the user to view individual micrographs, select particles, and export the single particle images.[51], [52] However, caution must be exercised because the process is neither 100% specific or sensitive in any software. Furthermore, if a sample is not 100% homogeneous, the automatic boxing programs may inappropriately include other particles of the same shape and size. Therefore, it is recommended that automatic selection be followed by an additional round of manual inspection so as to exclude any erroneously selected particles and include those particle missed by the autoboxing algorithm (Figure 9\n). The advantage of using an autoboxing program is that all of the boxes are automatically centered on the selected particles, a process that is very labor-intensive if performed manually. Because it is easier to delete boxes generated by the autoboxing programs than it is to manually select and center boxes, it is recommended that the threshold for autoboxing be set low enough to box all features in a micrograph. The same discretion that is used in image screening should also be used when boxing or inspecting boxed particles. Features such as charging 53 that may not be readily visible in the power spectrum of an entire micrograph may become apparent when viewing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of an individual particle, in which case the particle should either not be selected or be deleted.",

Because the CTF is a function of parameters specific to an individual micrograph, it is necessary to fit the CTF for every micrograph. Furthermore, because the CTF is also a function of defocus, it may be advantageous to extend this to every particle in a single image frame because variations in ice thickness can allow for multiple focal heights. For any given image, taking a rotational average of the FFT of all the particles in that image produces the CTF. However, depending on the sample and the imaging conditions, SNR becomes an issue when trying to accurately fit a small number of particles, especially when trying to determine the CTF for a small number of particles (Figure 10\n). In addition, in order to accurately fit the CTF of the data, it is recommended that a structure factor be used during fitting. Structure factors can be computed from X-ray solution scattering 56 or through manual fitting of a subset of the single particle data (Figure 11\n).",

            "text": "The CTF can be fit manually using programs such as ctfit in EMAN, in which the parameters discussed previously are modulated to fit the experimental curve (Figure 12\n). During CTF correction, the parameter that is by far the most sensitive to error is the defocus determined for the individual images. Because phase can be flipped and lost at different frequencies during the imaging process, fitting the defocus parameter in the CTF is a way to attempt to recover this information. The standard method for defocus determination is to correctly identify the \u2018zeros\u2019 in the CTF and fit them accordingly. Because the CTF zeros are less sensitive to defocus at low spatial frequencies, it is important to fit the defocus parameter at high spatial frequencies (as far out as one still has signal) so as to ensure that one does not flip the phase of the experimental data in relation to the fit (Figure 12). For this reason, the best approach to fitting the CTF is to correctly determine the noise profile for a micrograph and then adjust the defocus as a last step. In addition to the parameters discussed previously, Fourier amplitude fall-off (known as the envelop function) is another parameter that must be fit for each CTF curve and contributes significantly to the overall signal, especially at high spatial frequencies. Because this fall-off is a function of the instrument, specimen conditions, and the recording medium, it is not expected as a component of the theoretical CTF shown in eqn [1]. As such, for the purposes of CTF fitting, the effective envelope function can be assumed to decay as a Gaussian or an exponential function with respect to spatial frequency. A further complication in fitting the CTF of raw data is the presence of astigmatism, and although for most practical applications astigmatism is assumed to be insignificant, it is possible to determine and correct for its presence.57\n",

These alignments were further refined by finding the orientations with the highest cross common line correlation between raw particle images and reference projections from template models. The disadvantage of this approach is that the method decouples the center and orientation search, a problem that becomes an issue in the later steps of refinement. Furthermore, the self common lines approach is highly dependent on low spatial frequency contrast, making it difficult to properly identify the icosahedral orientation of particles imaged with a defocus less than 2 \u03bcm.58 Because close-to-focus image reconstruction was not possible with this algorithm, it was difficult to obtain high-resolution 3-D reconstructions from a single set of images.",

The novelty of this program is that it uses a series of optimization paths that can communicate with each other, effectively allowing each individual path to jump to a point of lower energy identified by another path. This approach has been shown to reduce the computational load of the traditional expensive cross common lines search approximately 1000-fold. Furthermore, this process allows for local refinement of the particle orientations once they have converged, providing a means by which high-resolution cryo-EM maps can be generated.",

As such, it is necessary for the model to converge to near subnanometer resolutions before attempting to refine the data any further. Once a reasonable high-resolution model of the virus has been generated, it is possible to begin refining the orientations to generate a higher resolution final model.

When targeting a resolution less than 4.0 \u00c5, it is necessary to consider correcting these variations on a per micrograph (astigmatism and beam effects) and per particle (magnification, defocus, and tilt) basis. Because the local environment in which each image is collected can produce variations in magnification and astigmatism, these aberrations should be iteratively refined in the final stages of producing a high-resolution reconstruction.[5], [10], [69] In addition, because variation in ice thickness and specimen tilt can position individual particles at different focal distances, applying a global CTF correction for defocus can potentially ablate high-resolution features of the data.[3], [69] To compensate for these differences, local refinement of the defocus for each particle in a micrograph can minimize phase flipping at high spatial frequencies and preserve the high-resolution features in the reconstruction (Figure 12). Because the resolution of single particle cryo-EM reconstructions are pushing nearer to atomic resolution, it is likely that further corrections will be necessary to compensate for irregularities in the beam and sample.",

For many viruses, the assumed symmetry is icosahedral; however, due to the nature in which these viruses are built and mature, there are important molecular components in their overall structure that are not symmetric. Accordingly, there has been an increased interest in the determination of the structure of these viruses without imposed symmetry because it will help shed light on the process of viral assembly and maturation.[6], [12], [16], [70], [13], [14], [15] The assumption of symmetry is often made because it simplifies the process of orientation determination. Furthermore, by icosahedrally averaging a map, the information content of a data set is enhanced, making it possible to achieve high-resolution reconstructions with nearly 60 times less data than for a reconstruction in which no symmetry is assumed.68 The process of orientation determination for an asymmetric reconstruction differs from the traditional symmetric orientation search in that one must be able to identify the non-icosahedral components in the virus particle.6 In the case of a phage such as P-SSP7, which has a large tail and portal structure, it is conceptually easy to understand how one would determine the asymmetric orientation of the particles because the non-icosahedrally symmetric feature is visible in the raw micrographs (Figure 15\n(a)). However, in the case of a virus such as HSV-1 in which the structure does not have such a protruding feature that is readily identifiable in raw micrographs, it is more difficult to find the true asymmetric orientation of the particle (Figure 15(b)). Once the asymmetric orientation of every particle has been determined, the process of reconstructing the virus asymmetrically is identical to any other reconstruction in which symmetry is assumed.",

First, in the event that an accurate initial model for your sample exists, there is no need to collect data at a defocus higher than 2 \u03bcm. In addition, by carefully screening your data on the front end, it is possible to eliminate entire micrographs of poor-quality data. A second level of screening can be performed at the level of boxing, where it is possible to identify and remove particles that may be experiencing the effects of local charging. Although there is no way to directly control for conformational heterogeneity within your sample, if there are visible differences in the raw particle data, it is possible to ameliorate this problem by selecting subsets of the data (Figure 9).

Depending on how well the eucentric height was determined, there may be little or no translational shift in the data. Nevertheless, even if there is little shift across all tilt angles, it is necessary to track the movement of fiducial markers across the entire tilt range. Theoretically, one should need only a handful of fiducial markers in a single tilt series to accurately align the tomogram; however, this is complicated by the fact that at some tilt angles, these markers may become obscured or unidentifiable by other features in the micrograph. For this reason, it is best to have many fiducial markers present in the micrograph so that even at high-degree tilt angles one can still align the tomogram (Figure 3(b)).",

Because most cryo-holders have a maximum tilt angle of \u00b170\u00b0 (although some 80\u00b0 holders are available), the total coverage for a tomogram is limited to 140\u00b0 at best (Figure 17\n(a)). Ideally, a tomogram would contain data collected across a full 180\u00b0; however, because this is not possible with the currently available cryo-holders, this lack of information from 70\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 is manifested as a missing wedge of data in Fourier space (Figure 17(b) and (c)), and if it is not corrected for, it can distort the final reconstruction. An additional complicating factor is that because the tilt angle for a group of particles in a single tomogram is identical, all the particles have the same missing wedge. However, because the particles are randomly oriented in the sample, each particle has different missing wedge data with respect to its orientation (Figure 17(b) and (c)). Because the missing wedge is manifest as a value of zero in the FFT of the data, calculation of the cross-correlation between two particles can result in the elimination of a great deal of information in Fourier space because cross-correlation involves multiplication by these zeros (Figure 17(c)). To address the fact that the presence of missing data in the Fourier space can hinder proper alignment of the subvolumes,[27], [28] procedures have been developed to circumvent this problem by normalizing the cross-correlations calculated for two particles at different orientations (Figure 17(f)).28 Although this approach has been met with success, there is no guarantee that the missing wedge problem has been solved, especially for high-resolution tomographic reconstructions.",

This process is typically initialized through comparison with an approximate model of the virus. However, in the event that no adequate reference model is available, it is necessary to generate an initial model from the available data. The raw data can be used to generate an adequate initial model by comparing subtomograms to each other in a process known as \u2018all-vs-all\u2019 comparison.76 This initial model can be further improved through a series of iterative refinements in which the individual subtomograms are classified, aligned, and averaged to a single or multiple 3-D models. Furthermore, as in single particle cryo-EM, particles can be aligned with respect to their asymmetric features, making it possible to generate single particle cryo-ET maps without imposing symmetry in the map. Nevertheless, again as in single particle cryo-EM, the assumption of symmetry during reconstruction dramatically enhances map resolution.16 To generate a 3-D model from cryo-ET data, once the orientation search is complete and the particles have been aligned, the data can be reconstructed into a 3-D model by averaging the individual subtomograms together while accounting for the missing wedge information from each particle.28\n",

To that end, it is possible that two maps with the same resolution, as determined by the FSC criterion, may have different structural features resolved. Furthermore, although calculating an FSC threshold is a common procedure, it is highly sensitive to any postprocessing performed on the map and as such, resolution enhancement via the FSC criterion can occasionally become slightly subjective.",

For viruses, when symmetry is assumed in the reconstruction, it is possible to extract just the asymmetric unit and segment it accordingly;[29], [48] however, as more viruses are reconstructed without imposed symmetry, it will become necessary to consider the map as a whole.[6], [13], [15], [14] Although a map can be segmented manually by visual inspection of the density map, simultaneous visualization of the map with fit crystallographic homologs eases the process. Traditionally, segmentation is performed manually,[75], [84], [85] but tools have been developed to automate certain aspects of the segmentation process. These programs use a variety of approaches, such as watershed86 and principal component analysis87 or multiscale segmentation,88 to identify individual protein components in the virus. Although these algorithms save a great deal of time during segmentation, their accuracy depends on the resolution and the overlapping density between adjacent molecules.",

By identifying the location, length, and relative positions of \u03b1 helices and \u03b2 sheets in a map, it is possible to search these parameters across structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and identify potential homologs.77 When the map resolution approaches 4.5 \u00c5 and beyond, it becomes feasible to trace the backbone of individual protein subunits either de novo or through homology modeling.30 Furthermore, the ability to identify SSEs within a 3-D volume suggests that these programs may eventually provide a means to determine feature-based assessment of the resolution of a map (Figure 18).",

Perhaps the most important of these non-icosahedrally arranged proteins, for the viral life cycle, is the genome packaging apparatus (portal) located at one of the 12 fivefold vertices in dsDNA viruses (Figure 20\n).[6], [14] During icosahedral reconstruction, asymmetric features such as the portal are averaged out across the entirety of the map. To adequately resolve these features, it is necessary to implement a reconstruction scheme that does not assume symmetry. As a result of this asymmetric approach, reconstructions require approximately 60 times as many particles to achieve an equivalent icosahedral resolution. A comparison of the structures of viral particles both with and without DNA has elucidated one mechanism of DNA release.6 In the case of P-SSP7, a valve in the nozzle protein (through which the viral DNA travels) opens and triggers this release. This event is synchronized with a conformational change in the tail spikes, in addition to the loss of core proteins (Figure 20(c)). To date, asymmetric reconstructions have yet to reach the resolutions seen when icosahedral symmetry is assumed (<4 \u00c5). Nevertheless, the potential to extend these reconstructions to higher resolutions remains feasible as larger data sets become available and reconstruction algorithms continue to mature.",

Although subnanometer resolution reconstructions have become the rule, not the exception, for single particle cryo-EM, its use for studying pleomorphic particles such as HIV, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome is limited. Because HIV is an enveloped virus, its outer surface consists of a variety of glycoproteins and so there is no guarantee that the individual particles are the same shape or size, even though they appear to be so in cryo-EM. As a result of this size heterogeneity and the possibility for variation in the number of glycoproteins in the envelope, cryo-ET is the only feasible approach for studying these particles. As discussed previously, the use of cryo-ET limits the maximum achievable resolution for a reconstruction. However, a few studies have pushed this resolution limit to 20 \u00c5 and below for a few structural elements of HIV.[26], [33] To address this issues, the process of CTF correction, often employed during single particle cryo-EM, has been used on tomographic data to resolve the Gag lattice of HIV to approximately 17 \u00c5 (Figure 21\n). 26 Cryo-ET has also been used to resolve the individual gp120 trimers on the surface of the HIV virus.33\n",

Fortunately, after extensive data processing and reconstruction, it becomes possible to resolve these features \u2013 in some instances at near-atomic resolutions. Although most of this work has been augmented by image processing techniques that computationally enhance image contrast, advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the microscopist to do so directly by altering the optics of the electron microscope. One such approach, conceived more than a half century ago, works by introducing a \u03c0/2 phase shift in the scattered electrons with respect to the unscattered electrons.94 Although not possible in electron microscopy with materials at that time, this is now accomplished by introducing a thin carbon-film phase plate in the back focal plane of the objective lens. This technique, also known as Zernike phase contrast electron microscopy, is technically challenging due to the difficulty in implementing and maintaining such a device, but the possibilities of its application are tremendous. Although many devices have been proposed for this application,[55], [95], [96] thin carbon-film phase plates have already begun to show promising results.[16], [97], [98] As a result of the high contrast in these images, it has been shown that one can reduce the data required for a subnanometer reconstruction by a factor of 3 compared with conventional imaging.16 This approach is particularly advantageous for cryo-ET because a reconstruction from a single tomogram can provide as much detail as reconstruction from approximately 17 000 single particle images of \u03b515 phage.16 For the purpose of studying virus particles whose structural components have proven intractable to analysis given current methodologies, this new technology is likely to play a key role in addressing questions plagued by structural heterogeneity.",

During approximately the past 5 years, exciting advances have occurred with regard to how electron microscopy data are produced and collected, in addition to how these data are processed and reconstructed into high-resolution models. For icosahedral reconstructions, the resolutions of these models are quickly approaching that of X-ray crystallography, making it possible to identify primary structural features, firsthand, from within large macromolecular complexes in near-native environments.[5], [11], [100], [101], [102] Furthermore, advances in data processing algorithms have allowed reconstructions, when icosahedral symmetry is not assumed, to finally reach subnanometer resolutions. Although the resolutions of cryo-ET reconstructions have yet to surpass the subnanometer threshold, the breadth of questions that can be addressed with this technology far surpasses that of the single particle approach. Because cryo-ET provides a means to discern heterogeneity at the virus-cell level, it is possible to process the data accordingly. Although these advances appear to have pushed cryo-EM up against the seemingly insurmountable resolution limit set by crystallography, the fact that they have done so in the span of just a few years gives promise for future advancements in the field. Looking forward, considering how the field has evolved in such a short time, both cryo-EM and cryo-ET are likely to have many more surprises in store, not just in technology advancements but also in the scientific discoveries that will result from their application.",

Low-frequency contrast is extremely useful for particle alignment, but it comes at the cost of high-resolution information, which is lost as a function of the exponentially decaying envelope function. (a) Contrast enhancement due to defocus can be seen in the real images collected on the electron microscope. Although the \u2018real image\u2019 data taken at a high defocus (3.2 \u03bcm) appear to be sharper, this is a reflection of the low-resolution contrast enhancement obtained by defocusing the image and does not necessarily make it more useful for the purposes of reconstruction. (b) The difference in defocus is also visualized in Fourier space, where the image taken closer to focus has broader thon rings that extend further outward in Fourier space.

To ensure that one has a complete data set that can be reconstructed to a subnanometer resolution, it is important to have data collected across a broad range of defocuses \u2013 high defocus for initial model generation and low defocus for high-resolution reconstructions. (d) A further complication of high-defocus images is the rapidly decaying envelope that limits the information content (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) of these images.

During tomography, the limited tilt range of the sample holder results in the creation of a missing wedge of data that is visible in the 3-D Fourier transform of the data. (b) The 3-D Fourier transform of data from two icosahedral particles shows that when the particles are oriented along the same axis (fivefold), their missing wedges are not necessarily oriented with respect to each other. (c) A 2-D simplification of the 3-D Fourier transforms shown in panel b; the Fourier amplitudes are shown in cyan and the missing wedge in red (both sets of data are still oriented along the fivefold axis). (d) To illustrate the missing wedge problem, the product of the Fourier amplitudes for the data in panels b and c is shown. Because the missing wedge is manifest as a zero value in Fourier space, any multiplication by the missing wedge will eliminate Fourier amplitudes in the data (light red wedges). When the total sum of Fourier amplitudes is used to choose the best orientation of the two particles with respect to each other, the data eliminated by the missing wedge will result in selection of the wrong orientation. In this example, the best orientation (at the bottom) is not selected because the majority of the Fourier amplitudes were eliminated when multiplied by the missing wedge. (e) To minimize the effect of this pitfall caused by the missing wedge, an alternative approach, for orienting two particles to each other, is needed that can circumvent this problem. (f) Computing the Fourier amplitude cross-correlations reveals that the highest correlation belongs to the orientation that maximized the Fourier amplitudes in panel d. Unfortunately orientations determined this way may not be entirely accurate as they tend to be biased by the missing wedge. However, if the cross-correlations are normalized with respect to each other (i.e., by setting the mean=0, and standard deviation=1), the sharp short peak in the pre-normalized data (orange) is transformed to the tallest peak in the post-normalized data. As a result of this normalization, the true orientation is chosen correctly (g), even though the overall Fourier amplitudes are less than those for other false orientations (h). This process is advantageous because it is less sensitive to the presence of the missing wedge which can obscure accurate orientation determination.",

(b) At 9 \u00c5, it is possible to see large \u03b1 helices separated from each other in the structure of vp6; however, at this resolution, \u03b2 sheets are not separated and appear as large, flat surfaces in the reconstruction. The crystal structure of vp6 [PDB ID 1QHD] fit to this density shows the locations of the \u03b1 helices (1) and \u03b2 sheets (2). (c) At 3.8 \u00c5, very small \u03b1 helices are resolved (1), and it becomes possible to visualize the pitch of these helices in addition to the individual \u03b2 strands that comprise a \u03b2 sheet (2) [EMID-1461]. The crystal structure of vp6 has not been fit to this density.
