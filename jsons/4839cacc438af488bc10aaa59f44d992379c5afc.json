One of the acute environmental effects of the pandemic is the sudden surge in the demand for and use of plastic products to protect the general public, patients, health and services workers. The widespread use of protective gear throughout the world as the pandemic creates massive upstream supply chain disruptions and downstream waste disposal problems. The demand trend is expected to match the global pandemic curve for various plastic products, as personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks for health workers, disposable plastic components for life support equipment, respirators, and general plastic supplies including syringes. Used plastic products are frequently pathogencontaminated, and ought to be handled as hazardous waste. Even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of plastic waste was considered to be a major environmental issue due to growing concerns about pollution in terrestrial and marine ecosystems [3] . Worldwide waste management systems have already been unable to deal with existing plastic waste satisfactorily, the impending surge in the volume of waste from the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm existing waste management systems as does healthcare capacity.",

            "text": "Medical waste from hospitals is particularly problematic due to the need to destroy any residual pathogens [4] . Treatment facilities are typically designed to handle steady-state conditions where the medical waste is handled at a predictable average flowrate and composition. Various treatment technology options are based on thermal processes as incineration, steam treatment (autoclaving), plasma treatment, and microwave treatment. The choice of treatment is dictated by multiple economic, technical, environmental, and social acceptability [5] . Rapid scale-up of waste volume likely upsets systems that are designed for steady-state conditions. Experience in Wuhan shows that optimisation models can be used to provide decision support for the reverse supply chain problem of hospital waste management [6] . A related problem is a decision where new facilities should be built to handle the increased waste volume. The relevant aspects include economics, emissions, safety, regulatory issues, and public acceptance. However, at the onset of the pandemic, it is too late for those thoughts. Figure 1 illustrates the matching of the supply of and demand for medical waste treatment during the pandemic. The expected amount of waste far exceeds the available capacity for treatment of hazardous medical waste since these systems were designed for waste quantities generated during normal operations. If suppressions measure alone is not sufficient, new facilities can be built, or mobile units used [7] to ramp up capacity. A Pinch Point occurs where this expanded capacity meets the peak of the suppressed curve and ensuring that hazards from pathogen-contaminated wastes are managed. It can be seen that a large surplus is treatment capacity would be left in place after the pandemic subsides. It is unlikely that these treatment facilities are to be incinerators with heat recovery, and that they can be repurposed for municipal solid waste.",

Incineration of medical waste coupled with waste heat recovery is an option that allows the chemical energy content of plastics to be recovered for useful purposes. An early LCA [8] with sensitivity analysis of heat recovery efficiency confirms that environmental impacts are minimised by maximising energy recovery. This is confirmed by more recent LCA, even when non-thermal options as chemical disinfection are considered [9] . However, there are obstacles to the widespread use of incineration with heat recovery. Public concerns about trace emissions of dioxins and furans can become problematic [10] .",

A problematic issue is a mismatch between the supply of and demand for the recovered heat. It can be both temporal and spatial. Some experts [11] expect the pandemic may peak in the second quarter of 2020 when the demand for heat in most of the Northern Hemisphere declines due to warmer weather. Waste-to-energy facilities may not be conveniently located for energy recovery since priority is inevitably put on safe disposal of contaminated waste. Xu et al. [12] show perspectives on balancing heat supply and demand to handle spatial and temporal imbalances. However, it remains uncertain if systems to be built on short notice or bring the mobile units to handle rapidly escalating volumes of medical waste can be engineered for optimal energy recovery.",

            "text": "The pandemic has led to major challenges in the handling of municipal solid waste (MSW) and hazardous medical waste. China has the most data on this issue. According to the 11 March press releases of the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism in China [15] , the amount of MSW in large and medium cities was reduced by 30 % during the disease outbreak. However, the generation of medical waste increased sharply (+370 %) in Hubei Province, with a high proportion of plastics. From 20 January to 31 March, the accumulated medical waste in all of China was estimated as 207 kt. In Wuhan, medical waste increased from the normal level of 40 t/d to about a peak of 240 t/d, exceeding the maximum incineration capacity of 49 t/d [16] . The incineration cost of hazardous medical waste in China is estimated at 281.7-422.6 USD/t as compared to 14.1 USD/t for MSW [16] . Figure 2 shows the trends in waste flow compared to treatment capacity. Treatment systems designed for waste quality and quantity under normal conditions have to cope with dramatic changes that force abnormal operations. Engineering analysis is essential to ensure that these systems are able to cope with the dynamic and evolving nature of the pandemic. Another complication is that much remains unknown about the virus itself, as it is still unclear what products and processes would be needed to manage the pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis is highlighting the essential role of plastic in daily life. Management of the virus requires single-use plastic [17] , even if disposability is largely seen as an environmental liability in most other applications. An effective assessment tool can summarise the key environmental footprints of plastic products. Figure 3 shows the plastic demand by segment. Demand for medical products and packaging is increasing sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 3 : Plastic demand by segment [18] and the expected increasing trend in medical and packaging. However, the net plastic demand is yet to be assessed. The plastic demand in the medical sector to help in combating the COVID-19 including the face shield (PP), gown (LDPE), vinyl gloves (PVC), disposable bag, tube, masks (plastic sheet and non-woven fabric) etc. [19] a . The vast demand for food delivery or take out as well as grocery delivery [20] b increase PP, LDPE, HDPE, PETE and PS, which are the common packaging materials.",

Single-use plastics are seen by consumers as a safe alternative for many applications. Van Doremalen et al. [21] , studied the survival of the virus on different surfaces, including plastics. Kampf et al. [22] corroborated these results. Although plastics were shown to be no better than other materials in terms of virus retention, disposability is regarded as an important advantage by consumers prioritising hygiene. This has led to an increase in the use and disposal of plastic products, even for non-medical applications. On the other hand, the plastic demand in the other sectors (e.g., automotive and aviation applications) is dropping in the likely global economic recession. Lockdown measures have also led to an increase in the amount of packaging used for the delivery of food and groceries to residences. These shifts may exacerbate environmental issues with plastics, which already existed even before the pandemic occurred. Although this increase is unavoidable, environmental protection efforts should be sustained. In particular, metrics to facilitate system design and comparison of alternatives, footprints, should be developed and fully utilised.",

Recent reports of airborne transmission [23] have led to recommendations to use masks in public environments. Sound management of this waste can minimise unforeseen effects on human health or the environment. Effective management of biomedical and healthcare waste requires appropriate identification, collection, separation, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal, as well as important associated aspects including disinfection, personnel protection and training. Figure 4 summarises the waste treatment approaches during the outbreak. The source of contaminated waste is not limited to hospitals. Even advanced healthcare facilities have become insufficient for coping with the rapidly increasing number of infected. Patients with mild symptoms self-isolated at home generate contaminated MSW. This requires a substantial structural change in waste management, from the sorting rules, collection, waste treatment to the safety protocol of the waste collection workers. Various safety precautions can be found in ACR+ [24] . In the EU, waste masks, gloves, tissues and other contaminated waste are required to be doublebagged. In Germany, food containers which would normally be classified as recyclable waste. Now they have to be treated as hazardous waste if there is a risk of contamination with pathogens [24] . Households with positive or suspected COVID-19 cases are suggested to limit the use of separate waste collection systems [24] . These practices serve as precautions; however, it stimulates the use of plastic and the generation of mixed waste. They create logistical challenges for waste management systems, and other economic and environmental issues take a back seat in the coronavirus crisis. Incineration and steam sterilisation (90 min, 120 o C) are the common pathways for thermal treatment of hazardous medical waste. The residue of these processes can be safely handled after the adequate decontamination cycle in accordance with non-hazardous solid waste regulation [26] . In Germany, incineration temperature is required a strict procedure, to be at 1,000 o C to ensure safe destruction [24] . Recommendation by the WHO for healthcare waste is between 900-1,200 o C [28] . The main challenge is that COVID-19 is creating a waste surge that can exceed treatment capacity by a large margin. Whether to utilise the MSW incineration capacity for medical waste in this critical situation remains an open question. In Spain, it is stated that if necessary, cement plants can co-incinerate waste upon request [24] . Norway allows a temporary change in landfill permits and permits to carry waste elsewhere to cope with the medical waste surge [24] , if necessary. One of the current debates dealing with this unexpected crisis is to have on-site, mobile or off-site treatment [29] . In China, on-site and mobile treatment is considered to be preferable due to its flexibility in responding to shifting demands. They have always been advantages and drawbacks and are subject to context-specific constraints.",

The assumptions (e.g. the incentives, taxes, oversimplification on exact the plastic composition, collection system) made during the planning of waste management systems are suddenly no longer fully valid. They were justified by the need to achieve levels of collection, recycling and recovery defined at the political level, has led to under-sizing of recovery and disposal facilities, favouring recycling even when it was neither possible nor sustainable, as in the case of the current pandemic. Figure 5 shows the environmental and economic performance of different plastic waste management approaches. Pyrolysis and gasification are in development, stimulated by the request of more sustainable waste treatment options [31] . An economic assessment proposes the present scenario is sustained by tipping fee that is continuously rising due to the high costs of transportation towards the treatment processes, both those for recovery as well as those for disposal [32] . Many of the countries have restricted the use of plastic bags. In the EU, even if the food packaging is plastic, the carrying bag is made of paper. However, the environmental footprint advantage of paper bags is questionable, especially since they have limited potential for reuse. Figure 6 shows the material share for packaging. The typical paper bag (2.62 MJ/bag) has a higher energy footprint than a typical plastic bag (0.76 MJ/bag), which is much lighter. This reduced weight also incurs reduced footprints elsewhere in the supply chain. A study by the UK Royal Society of Chemistry [34] reports that the paper has a higher Water Footprint and generates more air pollutants throughout its life cycle. This figure indicates that plastics can have superior environmental sustainability if properly used and disposed of. The concept of Plastic Waste Footprint (PWF) was introduced [14] to quantify such aspects. It is defined as the total mass of plastic waste used for a process, product or service minus amount of plastic avoided +reused + recycled + reprocessed, as expressed in Eq(1).",

PWF can be used as a medium to assess sustainability compared to the alternatives (e.g. paper), by considering GHG emissions and energy consumption. A dynamic LCA approach is preferable. \u2022 Incorporation of social factors and uncertainties: Although sustainability consists of three pillars, social factor is trivialised in most of the optimisation studies or assessment (e.g. techno-economic assessment). For future planning, either the sustainability of plastic or any other environmental footprint assessment, it is important to include the social factors as well as understanding the potential impacts to a selection. \u2022 Amount control and fine-grid management: Although the surge in the short term seems to be unavoidable [43] , waste prevention should be at the highest priority of waste management. With the inspiration from the pandemic disease and the analytics of energy and environmental footprints, better trade-offs between medical/healthcare plastics and regular single-use plastics need to be performed to control the total amount and elevate the flexibility for future uncertainties. All categories of plastics can be managed in a fine-grid manner according to the newly proposed Plastic 4R programs in Figure 8 and circular economy strategies.",

The environmental issues are related to the life cycles of products and are measurable via metrics such as footprints (PF and PWF) highlighted in this paper. The crucial priority is placed on the destruction of residual pathogens for the safe disposal of that waste. It is too early for comprehensive conclusions. However, they are some issues which can influence future environmental footprints: Would after the crises be money and energy (oil and gas) cheaper, would developed countries realise that 'outsourcing' to lower-cost bases is not always reliable, safe and or sustainable in the long-term? The collapse in crude oil prices to negative values was reported in the USA recently. However, it is uncertain if this price level will persist during the post-pandemic recovery period. The impact on the price, the demand for plastics, waste treatment and 6R initiatives have to be assessed. Although there have been studies suggesting the reduction in environmental impacts (e.g. NO X emissions) related to COVID 19, it is too early to gauge the long term net environmental effects. There is uncertainty over the economic recovery path, and there may be changes in consumer habits. Some issues have been highlighted as priorities in this contribution both for scientific research and for environmental policies. The emergency rush to rapidly build up capacities to cope with the crisis carries the risk that long-term sustainability aspects may be less considered unless they are highlighted. The risks can be averted by bearing several key points in mind:",
