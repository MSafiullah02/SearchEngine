Clearly, Italy and Germany deviate from the algebraic behavior and become exponential after about 15 days from the outbreak, signaling the substantial delay with respect to China and Japan of the implementation of containment strategies.

As we can see in Fig. 3 , the algebraic fitting provides consistent values in all provinces/regions, with exponent between 1 and 2, as stated by Eq. 2. This is compatible with the hypothesis of the removing population represented by the recorded number of cases.

The slowing down to b \u2248 0 is almost general, except for two locations: Gansu, with a late peak, and Hong Kong, where the epidemic seems to be bouncing up. Therefore, the epidemic is not fully contained even when total numbers (all China) do not show that so clearly. Those peaks at different times in different regions may indicate the epidemic arriving later or national measures implemented later. It is also important to stress that the peaks are of the exponents. As the growth rate for a power law regime n \u223c t b is \u2206n/n = b/t, an exponent 3 at day 30 gives a growth rate of 10%, while an exponent 2 at day 10 represents a growth rate of 20%.

Apart from some particular cases -most distinctive China but South Korea, Japan, and maybe Iran too-the rest seem to fit in one of two patterns, which we show in detail in Fig. 6 . Either they have a dormant phase (mostly imported cases with no local infections), followed by the onset of the exponential local spreading inside the country (Fig. 6b) , or they skip the dormant phase and enter the exponential phase almost immediately (Fig. 6c) . The last behaviour occurs for many European countries that have delayed the arriving of infected cases and are still facing the first weeks of the outbreak. They are lowering the growth rate, apparently in a steady way, but the growth rate \u223c 0.3 are still high, which means a doubling time of less than 2.5 days. The four countries displayed in Fig. 6a have the most distinctive behavior from the rest. The common denominator is the steady lowering of the growth rate coefficient. But the paths to the lowering are different between them. While for China is very clear, except for two small bumps in the third, and seventh week, due to delayed burst in some regions (see Fig. 4 ), South Korea and Japan show a more erratic pattern, oscillating around the 0.1 until recently, when South Korea finally managed to plunge its rate, following now the Chinese pattern. Iran, in turn, has not reached yet the 0.1 mark, but has been consistently lowering its rate since the beginning of cases, although it might be to soon to see if it is definitely going down. Finally, although Japan has managed to have less than 10% daily rate, it seems to struggle yet to lower even more its rate. Figure 6d shows the data on the growth rate of the US and the UK. They belong to the same group as displayed in Fig. 6b , but we decided to separate for the sake of clarity and show together with Germany as an example of (b) group. We see that they are at high values after a rebound in a qualitatively same pattern as Germany. The difference in the case of the UK and US is that they had more fluctuations (not seen in the panel) before the clear onset of the local spreading phase.",

Another important fact about China is that all its provinces/regions follow the same epidemic pattern. This is an evidence that China was able to contain the outbreak through a series of nationwide coordinated measures, corroborating the findings of WHO's joint mission in China [7] and setting China as the most successful case in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemics so far.",

(1)) as B = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3. As \u03b3 = 1/\u03c4 , we end up with B\u03c4 = R 0 \u2212 1, where R 0 = \u03b2\u03c4 . Then R 0 = 1 + B\u03c4 . Assuming that \u03c4 can be in the range 5-10 days, we estimate R 0 for three selected countries. With the lowest growth rate B = 0.016day \u22121 for South Korea, we obtain 1.08 < R 0 < 1.16, nearly to the epidemic threshold. On the other hand, for the biggest growth rate B = 0.725day \u22121 for Brunei, we obtain 4.6 < R 0 < 8.3. On the intermediate growth rates seeing in some EU countries, Sweden has 2.2 < R 0 < 3.5, in agreement early estimates of this number that put it around 3 [8] , and with other estimation [9] . However, if we take Italy at its worst day, we get R 0 as large as 10.",

On the other hand, both South Korea and Italy had a spike after the ending of their dormant phase and have significantly lowered their growth rate per day after the adoption of containment measures like massive testing (South Korea) and lock-downs (Italy). In the case of Italy the situation is much worse because the lower of the rate is not enough: still at 20% rate and with more than 27,000 cases, if no further lowering is attained quickly, the nation health system can soon be overwhelmed.",
