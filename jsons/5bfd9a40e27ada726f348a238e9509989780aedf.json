In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS-CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus-host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS-CoV.

The largest MERS outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia has occurred in South Korea with 186 cases and 39 deaths (CFR: 21%) from May to July 2015 (Chen, Chughtai, Dyda, & MacIntyre, 2017). Most people infected with MERS-CoV developed a severe respiratory illness with clinical symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Others may develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, and kidney failure. MERS can be life-threatening. Many deaths due to MERS-CoV have been reported (Al-Tawfiq & Memish, 2016).

Both typically require antigen presentation in conjunction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and a costimulatory signal for full activation(Lee, Lee, Chaudhary, Gill, & Jung, 2010). There are three possible outcomes of viral infection: Early clearance of the pathogen either directly or by phagocytosis, overwhelming infection with failure to control, persistent infection where a balance between the pathogen and the host is achieved(Simmons, Willberg, & Paul, 2001).Viruses use diverse mechanisms to avoid and antagonize the immune response of their hosts. These mechanisms include: enable the virus to avoid recognition by the humoral immune response, interfere with the functioning of the cellular immune response, and interfere with immune effector functions(Vossen, Westerhout, S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r, & Wiertz, 2002).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "associated molecular patterns such as viral double-stranded RNA are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors such as endosomal TLR3, melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5), and cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I;Kato, Takahasi, & Fujita, 2011). RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic sensors of virusderived RNAs(Goubau, Deddouche, & Reis e Sousa, 2013). RIG-I contains two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD)-like domains, and a C-terminal RNA helicase domain that binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA;Sumpter et al., 2005).Presumably, the binding of viral RNA to RIG-I leads to a conformational change that exposes the CARD-like domain, which then activates downstream signaling. Consistent with this model, overexpression of the N-terminal CARD-like domains of RIG-I is sufficient to activate both NF-\u03baB and IRF3(Yoneyama et al., 2004).Optimal activity of RIG-I and MDA5 also requires Protein kinase, interferon-inducible double stranded RNA dependent activator (PACT), a cellular dsRNA-binding protein which binds to RIG-I and MDA5 to activate IFN production(Kok et al., 2011). The activation of these receptors transmits a signal to downstream kinases TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) that form a functional complex with TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TANK.Consequent phosphorylation of IRF3 transcription factors by these kinases leads ultimately to transcriptional activation of IFN promoters.Once secreted, IFN-\u03b2 binds to its receptor on the cell surface and activates the synthesis of proteins with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory properties(De Veer et al., 2001). IFN-\u03b2 also participates in the induction of IFN-\u03b1s, which further amplify the antiviral response(Haagmans et al., 2004).Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) is essential for NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation by RNA viruses. This protein contains an N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD)-like domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that targets the protein to the mitochondrial membrane. MAVS functions downstream of RIG-I and upstream of I\u03baB and IRF3 phosphorylation (Seth et al.the signal transduction pathway that senses viral nucleic acids during pathogenic infection (Pfeffer, 2011). Similar to IRF3, NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in association with an inhibitor of the I\u03baB family. Stimulation of cells with cytokines leads to the activation of a large kinase complex consisting of the catalytic subunits IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 and the essential regulatory subunit NF-\u03baB essential modulator. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates I\u03baB and targets this inhibitor for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. NF-\u03baB is then liberated to enter the nucleus to turn on a battery of genes essential for immune and inflammatory responses (T. Liu, Zhang, Joo, & Sun, 2017). The activation of NF-\u03baB is a doubleedged sword: While normal functions of NF-\u03baB are needed for proper innate and adaptive immune responses, dysregulation of NF-\u03baB can lead to inflammatory diseases and tumorigenesis(Karin, 2006).Viruses have evolved effective strategies to evade the IFN system. They can inhibit IFN induction, IFN signal transduction, or the action of particular antiviral proteins by various mechanisms, including double-stranded RNA binding and IRF-3 sequestration.Coronaviruses encode multiple proteins to counteract the host innate antiviral response(Kindler & Thiel, 2014;Totura & Baric, 2012;. MERS-CoV-infected cells exhibited reduced IFN and cytokine expression(Ferran & Skuse, 2017). MERS-CoV M, 4a, 4b, and PLP proteins were recently found to antagonize type I IFN production (Y.Yang et al., 2013). Schematic illustration of inhibition of IFN signalling is shown inFigure 2.3.1.1 | M protein M proteins from MERS-CoV have three highly similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains named TM1, TM2, and TM3 that localized predominantly to the Golgi complex and is required for virion assembly and a C-terminal region(Neuman et al., 2011;Y. Yang et al., 2013). Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C-terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression. MERS-CoV M protein suppresses IRF3 activity but not NF-\u03baB signaling. It is known that the activation of RIG-I and MAVS results in activation of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB(Seth et al., 2005;Yoneyama et al., 2004). MERS-CoV M protein is capable of differentially suppressing the RIG-I-induced activation of IRF3.
