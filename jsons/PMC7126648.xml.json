In the last decade, there has been an increase in the number of cases of a wide spectrum of diseases in populations of diverse species of plants and animals 1., 2.. Emerging diseases in wildlife are important for the obvious reason that they can cause population declines in the susceptible species. But these diseases in wildlife are important from a human health standpoint too, because many of the emerging diseases in humans have been linked to wildlife species that serve as reservoirs of the pathogen. Furthermore, the study of emerging diseases in wildlife may well provide general insights that help us to understand the dynamics of emerging diseases in human populations.",

This disease affects mainly the green sea turtle (Figure 1\n), but cases have also been documented in loggerhead, olive ridley and now Kemp's ridley sea turtles. The fibrous growths typical of fibropapillomatosis were first described in 1938 and reports of the disease were relatively rare until after 1980 [4]. Now, fibropapillomatosis occurs around the globe and in one recent sample from the Hawaiian Islands more than 90% of green turtles showed symptoms of the illness [4].",

The growths associated with the disease occur mainly on the soft skin of the turtle, but they can appear internally as well. The growths can be so large that they interfere with normal mobility, vision, feeding and organ function. In addition to these gross mechanical effects, the disease appears to result in suppression of the immune system and a susceptibility to bacteremia 5., 6.. Consequently, death is the ultimate outcome for many of the turtles affected by the disease.",

But why does the virus causes so much harm now compared to 50 years ago? Two non-exclusive hypotheses can explain the sudden increase in frequency of fibropapillomatosis (and most other emerging diseases in wildlife for that matter). One possibility is that a change in the environment caused the host species to become extremely susceptible to a previously harmless strain of virus, for example, as a consequence of immune suppression, a new vector and so on. The other possibility is that the disease is caused by a virulent mutant form of a previously harmless virus.",

If the disease is a consequence of a new mutation that arose in the last 50 years, then all of the new, virulent viruses should be close relatives of one another, members of a lineage that has swept through the turtle populations in the last few decades. In fact, the time frame is so short that we would expect virus particles isolated from distinct turtles to have virtually identical sequences over large parts of their genome.",

This sea turtle example can be added to a fairly long list of species that have become susceptible to various types of pathogen as a consequence of environmental change \u2013 almost all of which are human-induced [2]. If biologists didn't have enough to worry about with the relatively obvious (but difficult to solve) conservation problems imposed by human population growth, habitat destruction, overharvesting and invasive species, this and other recent studies 1., 2. remind us that we can now add the relatively subtle but potentially devastating effects of increased susceptibility to pathogens to our growing list of threats to the biosphere.",
