These outbreaks have had a significant impact on the economy, global travel and society, and should serve as a warning for other emergent CoVs.

CoVs in general can cause disease in a variety of domestic and wild animals, as well as in humans, whereas alpha- and betacoronaviruses predominantly infect mammals. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus B\netacoronavirus, under the subgenera S\narbecovirus and M\nerbecovirus, respectively [5]. These viruses are genetically distinct [6]. SARS-CoV originated in China and spread worldwide, infecting approximately 8000 individuals with a overall mortality rate of 10 % during the 2002\u20132003 epidemic [7]. Since emerging in 2012 in the Middle East, MERS-CoV has spread to 27 countries and has infected humans with an estimated mortality rate of 35 % [8].",

One of the ongoing challenges that scientists face with these zoonotic crossover events is ensuring early warning or rapid detection and diagnosis so that effective countermeasures can be implemented. Unfortunately, current detection methodologies and our lack of understanding of cross-species transmission make the prediction of future spillover events nearly impossible. Active surveillance remains our best defence to ameliorate the impact of these events. With limited funding available for these surveillance systems in regions where they are likely to be needed the most, it is currently impossible to achieve sufficient breadth and depth to comprehensively detect all potential spillover events. An investment focused on surveillance of CoVs in bats is considered to be most impactful based on past data and the current trend of emerging infectious diseases worldwide [14].",

As bats are known to utilize alternative roost sites for different functions, only day roosts were considered for the ground survey to reduce the possibility of double counting [16]. Information such as bat species, population counts and age estimates were collected from the day roosts. Photographs of the roosting bats were taken to assist and complement survey counts. Individual bats were identified by their eyes, head, nose and wings using a taxonomic key [17].

The algorithm BaitMaker [34] was then used to design a custom probe set for coronaviruses (Table S1). Briefly, BaitMaker utilizes a k-mer-based search pattern strategy to identify regions of conservation and variability within a viral species. Non-redundant, non-overlapping probes are then designed to target these regions with a minimum of 85 % identity between the probe and the targeted sequence.

NS7c is not typically reported in HKU9, but was only found in the diliman-1525G2 virus found in C. brachyotis in the Philippines [39]. Based on the available partial genome sequence, NS7c was also present in BtCoV22/29, sharing 100 % sequence identity with the NS7c found in BtCoV92. BtCoV92 is closely related to the species Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 found in Leschenault\u2019s rousette and an unidentified species Rousettus sp. found previously in the Guangdong and Yunnan provinces [40] (Fig. 3). Bat coronavirus HKU9 and bat coronavirus GCCDC1 are two closely related yet distinct betacoronaviruses. GCCDC1 is genetically less diverse than HKU9 and has a p10 gene from reovirus in its genome [41]. HKU9 consists of five lineages and BtCoV92 does not group within any of the five lineages, which makes it a new one [41]. The S and N proteins of BtCoV92 showed 61\u201372 % and 74\u201380 % identity to those of the HKU9 species, respectively. We found no recombination between BtCoV92 and HKU9 (NC_009021.1 and HM211101.1) with the Simplot program (data not shown). The N protein of BtCoV92 showed 90 % identity with that of the diliman-1525G2 virus and they clustered in the same branch in the N protein phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4a and b).

In a previous study, a betacoronavirus (KX452687) was detected in local E. spelaea [42] and when comparing the N protein partial sequences with those of BtCoV92, BtCoV22/29, these sequences clustered under a different branch from KX452687 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4a).",

            "text": "In this study, we reported the characterization of the complete genome sequence of a novel coronavirus in Singapore from lesser dog faced bats (C. brachyotis). These bats were the most frequently counted bats during the island-wide surveillance and are commonly found in parks, where their food sources (fruit trees) are widely distributed. They are well adapted to living closely with humans, which inevitably increases the risk of disease transmission and the emergence of zoonoses [45]. Previously, flaviviruses (Phnom Penh virus, Carey island virus and Jugra virus), Nipah virus and betacoronaviruses have been found in C. brachyotis [39, 46, 47] . Obtaining the full-genome sequences for CoVs from field samples has always been challenging for multiple reasons: (1) the CoV genome (26\u201332 kb) is the largest non-segmented RNA viral genome known to date [15]; (2) CoV genomes are genetically highly variable due to the high frequency of recombination among CoVs [48] [48, 49]; and (3) the absolute amount and relative percentage of viral nucleic acid is generally very low in clinical/field samples. In the current study, we developed a CoV-targeted probe-based enrichment strategy to improve the efficiency of CoV genome characterization. As a proof of concept, we applied this CoV-enrichment NGS strategy to rapidly characterize the first complete CoV genome sequence in Singapore from a novel CoV detected in C. brachyotis. Genetically, this newly found CoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus and is closely related to the species Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 [50] and diliman-1525G2 [39].",

Multiple sequence alignment of the BtCoV92 coronavirus sequence and 2211 sequences present in NCBI database was carried out using a fast Fourier transformation method in MAFFT v6.940b. An approximately maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated using the generalized time-reversible model of nucleotide evolution in FastTree v2.1.7. FastTree uses SH-like local supports with 1000 resamples to estimate and validate the reliability of each split in the tree. From the tree, the branch containing the sequence from the Bt92 coronavirus sequence and 58 sequences from NCBI was selected and a more robust maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was created using RAXML with 1000 bootstrap replications. The trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.2.",
