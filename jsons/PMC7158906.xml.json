SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of pneumonia.5 By March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led to 80 981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, and 44 067 cases in 117 countries.6 A cohort study of 44 672 Chinese cases reported that 2\u00b71% of patients were younger than 20 years, and 1\u00b72% were asymptomatic.7\n",

Collectively, these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of 15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4\u201314 years), six patients had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs.12 At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were on the spring festival holiday, which might have prevented children from exposure to transmission sources. However, the school community is a place that can enhance rapid spread of the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2.",

We found 13 studies about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. These studies were related to treatment recommendations, CT features in 15 children, case reports, and COVID-19 in infants. To our knowledge, no study has been done to comprehensively investigate a cohort of paediatric patients with COVID-19 and their distinctive clinical features. Published work about adult patients has shown that manifestations vary strikingly by individual. Since children are different from adults in many aspects, such as immunological development, we aimed to investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.\nAdded value of this study\nBetween Jan 17 and March 1, 2020, 661 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Ningbo and Wenzhou (Zhejiang province, China). Of these cases, 36 were in children. All children with COVID-19 had been infected either by close contact with adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or by exposure to the epidemic area. Although fever, cough, and pneumonia were the most common signs, about half the children had mild disease with no presenting symptoms. Fewer children with COVID-19 had obvious symptoms compared with adult patients with COVID-19 and paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza described in previous studies.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nBy contrast with findings in adults, children with COVID-19 had milder clinical manifestations; nearly half of paediatric patients were asymptomatic (ie, no fever and no cough). This asymptomatic condition is relevant if community-acquired transmission becomes the primary mode; identification of paediatric patients without presenting symptoms will become a great challenge. Fortunately, the number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 accounted for a small proportion of total people infected, and paediatric patients also had clear epidemiological information. Devising measures to protect children from infection with SARS-CoV-2 is very important.\n",
