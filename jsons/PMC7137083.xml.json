More recently, outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, in 2012, have been characterised by human-to-human transmission and high incidence of acute respiratory failure. The growing alarm for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spreading from China brings back the spectre of the rapidly diffusing pandemics of the past.2\n",

However, during pandemics, the number of intensive care unit beds for mechanical ventilation through tracheal intubation could rapidly become insufficient,1 whereas non-invasive ventilation can be offered also outside the intensive care unit.4\n",

Accordingly, when facing a patient with acute respiratory failure of suspected viral nature (and, above all, during pandemics), we recommend the adoption of helmets and avoidance of face masks as the non-invasive ventilation interface. Moreover, we suggest that manufacturers should develop cheap and safe non-invasive ventilation interfaces to be used during viral pandemics.",
