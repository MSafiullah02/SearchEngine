Hospitals with outpatient telemedicine services were more frequently large, private, not-for-profit, teaching hospitals than those without these services. The proportion of rural and critical access hospitals was not significantly different between these hospitals. Of the 2816 hospitals with ICUs, 756 (26.8%) reported tele-ICU capabilities. Tele-ICU hospitals were more frequently not-for-profit, private hospitals, and compared with hospitals without tele-ICU capabilities, a smaller proportion were rural or critical access hospitals (Table) .",

On the basis of findings among responders, nonresponders in the American Hospital Association surveys are more frequently nonteaching, small, for-profit hospitals and would be less likely to have had telemedicine services. Second, our analysis focused on telemedicine consultation and office visits at hospital-based practices and does not include private clinics or standalone telemedicine businesses. Therefore, our study appraises availability of telehealth services at hospitals but not of the totality of the telehealth landscape. Third, we evaluated the presence of telemedicine services but were unable to quantify capacity across U.S. hospitals; some hospitals may have broad, well-developed This article was published at Annals.org on 30 April 2020. programs, whereas others may not.
