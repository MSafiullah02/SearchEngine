LTCFs were regarded as healthcare facilities that provided skilled care for an indefinite period of time predominantly for elderly patients who were no longer able to live independently. Resources in LTCFs were limited; patients with infections were frequently transferred to a hospital for diagnostic evaluation, intravenous treatment, and monitoring (1, 2) . As the role of the typical nursing home (NH) within our healthcare system has evolved, this perception of LTCF's may be changing. The acuity of the typical \"modern\" LTCF patient is increasing, as patients are now discharged from hospital to continue treatment for increasingly complex conditions and undergoing rehabilitation prior to being discharged home (1, 3) . For example, a significant proportion of patients may have indwelling devices that may predispose the patient to infection. With the expansion of rehabilitative, subacute care, and acute-chronic care services, more chronic care facilities are providing a wider range of services for an increasingly ill patient population (1, 4) . In this current environment, it is likely that the number, complexity, and severity of infections cared for in LTCF will continue to increase.",

It is thought that the widerange of infection rates may reflect the diversity of populations that require chronic inpatient care. Infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts are most commonly followed by skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI); these three clinical syndromes account for the majority of infections seen in the chronic care setting (1) (2) (3) 5) . Gastrointestinal (GI) and bloodstream infections (BSI) are less frequently documented and, perhaps, are less prevalent (3) . Cultures of blood have not been recommended in part because BSI are perceived to be uncommon; when present death occurs rapidly, and most residents transferred to hospital before the diagnosis of BSI can be made or advanced directives preclude evaluation (2, 6) .",

Without culture of blood or tissue, the etiology of SSTI is rarely known, and differentiation between infection and superficial colonization is difficult (12, 13) .

Acute or worsening changes in the ability to perform basic activities of daily living such as toileting, mobility, dressing, or feeding can be a very sensitive indicator for infection in LTCF residents. Fever can be a very useful indicator if its definition is sufficiently sensitive to detect most infections in the population being evaluated. The most common definition of fever (temperature >101\u00b0F) is met in only 40% of LTCF residents. If the fever definition in this population is lowered to 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), then 70% of infections will be detected with a specificity of 90%. More than half of NH residents with a temperature of 100\u00b0F will have infection. Other investigators have suggested that baseline temperatures should be established for each resident; fever would be defined as an increase of 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C) over the baseline temperature or >99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C) orally or 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C) rectally (2, 5, 17) . Signs of dehydration such as decreased oral intake, dry mucous membranes and tongue, or furrowed tongue may, indirectly, be an indicator that fever and possible infection is present in this population (2, 5) .",

Alternate definitions for LTCF have been sought. The McGeer criteria were developed specifically for LTCFs and rely primarily on readily available clinical criteria derived from history and physical examination (see Table 1 ) (18) . The Minimum Data Set was developed to document resident problems on a quarterly basis during their LTCF stay, but recent studies suggest that this is not a reliable instrument for diagnosis of infection (19, 20) . Few studies have assessed what laboratory procedures are useful in establishing the diagnosis of infection in LTCF residents. A complete blood count (CBC) is a useful diagnostic test to obtain in this setting. Evidence of leukocytosis and or left shift provides strong evidence that an older adult has an infection as defined as a white blood cell count >14,000 cells/mm 3 , neutrophils >90%, or elevated total band count >6% or >1,500 cell/mm 3 (2) . Suspicion of dehydration may be supported by the presence of hypernatremia and prerenal azotemia; 60% of LTCF residents may have at least one of these chemical abnormalities (2) . Abnormalities of the complete blood count and serum chemistry can provide important clues that infection is present.",

With the suppressive effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the anaerobic flora of the gut, toxin-producing C. difficile can emerge and cause diarrhea (55) .
