Efflux pump genes which confer resistance to macrolides, quinolones and aminoglycosides were also identified. Meanwhile, the AF18 genome possesses 20 genomic islands, 11 prophages, and five CRISPR sequences (Table S5) , suggesting the active transfer of stress-adaptive genes by these mobile genetic elements in this species. More importantly, markers of soil-inhabiting bacteria, including a complete nitrogen fixation gene cluster and ksgA--a pesticide-resistant gene, were found in AF18 genome, which suggests that AF18 is able to colonize natural environments. The mobility of this strain may potentiate its dissemination to various habits. Analysis of conserved genes in plasmids shows that most of the antibiotic-resistant genes of AF18, including qnrS, dfrA, and bla CTX-M-3 , are carried by the smaller plasmid pAF18_2 (Fig. 3 , Table S4 ) which is, in major part, responsible for the antibiotic resistance profile of AF18 (Table 1 ). Sequence alignment shows that pAF18_ 2 is similar to many plasmids from other Enterobacteriaceae species, such as E. coli (KF914891.1, KC788405.1, CP028486.1), K. pneumoniae (KX928750.1, CP026179.1), and C. freundii (KT989599.1), and they contain identical replication origins, replication and transcription systems, plasmid partition systems, and a partial gene cluster responsible for plasmid conjugation, which indicates that the plasmid might be compatible with all these Enterobacteriaceae host species. Besides, these plasmids share a common anti-restriction system that ensures they would not be destroyed by the restriction-modified system in other host strains. Specifically, the pAF18_2 contains an active transposase system with complete IS elements which had acquired the bla CTX-M-3 gene and an arsenical resistant system. Many other DNA manipulating enzymes, such as integrase and DNA invertase, were also identified in the plasmid, all of which could facilitate the plasmid in efficiently acquiring and transferring antibiotic-resistance genes and other stressadaptive genes among Enterobacteriaceae strains.

For example, E. coli and K. pneumoniae can share these ARGs through various genetic mobile elements or even in a more efficient manner of conjugating resistant plasmids [31] . Thus, the species of AF18 may prove important in spreading ARGs and function as a mediator in the eco-evolutionary feedback loops of AMR. In this regard, the novel species and many other emerging opportunistic pathogens of Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Kluyvera spp. and Enterobacter spp., deserve more attention in clinical practice and in the field of antibiotic resistance control.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 508, "end": 512, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 699, "end": 703, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 851, "end": 855, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1059, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1352, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our study, the resistant AF18 does not have to transfer its resistance gene to the co-infected sensitive K. pneumoniae to confer protection.

Such co-operation between different bacteria has been deeply investigated in experiments, and relevant theories or mathematic models have been fully developed which illustrated the important role of growth regulation in maximizing the benefit and population of the entire consortium [32] [33] [34] .
