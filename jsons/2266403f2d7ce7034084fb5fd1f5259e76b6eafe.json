In this article I identify this new obligation as the 'duty to report', and examine competing accounts on the degree to which states appreciate this new obligation are considered by examining state behaviour during the H5N1 human infectious outbreaks in East Asia (since 2004). The article examines reporting behaviour for H5N1 human infectious cases in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam from 2004 to 2010. The findings lend strong support to the claim that East Asian states have come to accept and comply with the duty to report infectious disease outbreaks and that the assertions of sovereignty in response to global health governance frameworks have not systematically inhibited reporting compliance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Inevitably, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has inspired much discussion about the changed understanding of what states ought to do when responding to infectious disease outbreaks and the question of whether changed expectations have actually changed behaviour. The chair of the negotiations on the revision of the 1969 International Health Regulations (IHR), 1 Mary Whelan, expressed doubt that consensus on the revisionswhich codified these changed expectations -would have been possible without the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Whelan, 2008, p. 5) , implying that the consensus remained a fragile one and the likelihood of compliance limited. Therefore, to understand whether there are new shared expectations about the prompt reporting of disease outbreaks and the extent to which these expectations have altered state behaviour, we need to examine behaviour in the immediate post-SARS setting. The aftermath of an event such as SARS is the perfect time to examine whether that sense of urgency generated by the crisis can be utilized to achieve long-term behavioural change (Whelan, 2008) . David Heymann (2006, p. 352) has argued that this behavioural change is already evident: 'the detection of, and international response to, the SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that countries are willing to forgo the exclusive privilege of reporting and responding to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories in a manner over which they have supreme control'. He goes on to note that the East Asian response to Avian Influenza (AI), H5N1, which (re)appeared in December 2003 in poultry and went on to infect humans from 2004, 2 was indicative of a normative change where the duty to report prevailed over the financial and political costs of not doing so.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 554, "end": 574, "text": "(Whelan, 2008, p. 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1117, "text": "(Whelan, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1148, "text": "David Heymann (2006, p. 352)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This article examines Heymann's claims in more detail.

The H5N1 outbreak is particularly interesting given that it emerged at a time when states were formalizing these new responsibilities in the revised IHR, which were then under negotiation (2004) (2005) and that some states affected by H5N1 -China and Vietnam especially -were still recovering from SARS when this outbreak occurred. What is of particular interest is the alternative suggestion to Heymann (2006) , which is that some degree of 'rebalancing' and reassertion of sovereignty occurred in the context of H5N1 in response to the overt interference of the WHO in domestic responses during SARS (Calain, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Hoffman, 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 436, "text": "(2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 437, "end": 443, "text": "(2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 638, "end": 652, "text": "Heymann (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 844, "end": 858, "text": "(Calain, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 859, "end": 886, "text": "Stevenson and Cooper, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 887, "end": 901, "text": "Hoffman, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The article will proceed with a discussion of the post-SARS environment, and then examine how the International Relations (IR) literature has understood the events that followed during the H5N1 outbreak.

However, this interpretation is not based on an empirical assessment of how states actually behaved. To remedy this, I test the extent to which states engaged in 'frank and prompt reporting' (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) during the H5N1 outbreak. Doing so reveals that states did overwhelmingly meet this duty, even during the years when they were not legally bound to do so (which was not until the IHR revisions came into force in mid-2007) .

WHA 54.14 (2001) was the first expression of an expectation that states had a duty to report outbreaks that could pose an international risk, and when they did not report an outbreak they expected the WHO to request for further information.

However, this could not have occurred without the WHO's earlier efforts to promote new behaviours in the field of disease reporting and states acceptance of this need in 2001. During the SARS outbreak, a critical mass of support for the duty to report was again reached during the 2003 WHA. WHA Resolution 56.28 (2003) was unanimously passed, calling for completion of the revised IHR (1969) framework and draft regulations to be in place and ready for adoption by May 2005 WHA meeting (Whelan, 2008, p. 6 ). In the same resolution, it was noted that the as yet unrevised IHRs were 'inadequate' and failed to include specific actions required of member states and the WHO (WHA 56.28, 2003) . Member states thus agreed that even before the adoption of the IHR revisions, they would 'establish immediately a national standing task force or equivalent group and, within it, to designate an official or officials having operational responsibilities and accessible at all times by telephone or electronic communication, to ensure the speed, particularly during emergencies of both reporting to the WHO and consultation with national authorities when urgent decisions must be made' (WHA 56.28, 2003: Paragraph 3[2] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 171, "text": "(Davies, 2011, p. 435)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 465, "end": 492, "text": "WHA Resolution 56.28 (2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 660, "end": 679, "text": "(Whelan, 2008, p. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 846, "end": 863, "text": "(WHA 56.28, 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1382, "text": "(WHA 56.28, 2003: Paragraph 3[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SARS and the Duty to Report"}, {"text": "After SARS, the shared expectation that states would report openly and promptly was again reaffirmed.

SARS was particularly exceptional because it exposed that a legal prescription for the duty to report was not the driving force required to change behaviour.

Why would states agree to a behavioural expectation that may be politically or economically costly? One view is that the risk of not reporting has become more risky for the sovereign than to openly report. Price- Smith (2009, pp. 143, 149) notes that China -the country most recalcitrant in reporting the extent of their SARS cases -was also the country that paid the highest economic and political cost. In other words, self-interested behaviour can remain the dominant norm for the sovereign state -but what defines self-interest is not static -it too changes through interaction with the wider social environment (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, p. 912 ). As such, constructivists have argued contra the neo-utilitarian view of liberal and realist perspectives that the evident readiness of states to agree to shared rules that constrain their behaviour demonstrates the degree to which global governance frameworks shape state identity, function and roles. In other words, 'a core constructivist research concern is what happens before the neo-utilitarian model kicks in' (Ruggie, 1998, p. 867, emphasis added) . In the area of health, the IR focus has been how to explain why the increase in global frameworks to address health concerns that were traditionally under the (confident) management of the state (Zacher and Keefe, 2008, p. 20) . One explanation is that the 'transition of public health governance on infectious diseases [for example] from the traditional Westphalian framework to something new y highlights changes that may be occurring to the general structure and dynamics of international relations in the era of globalization' (Fidler, 2004, p. 8) . This age of post-Westphalian global health governance has seen states socialized into cooperating in global governance frameworks and come to view such cooperation as serving their interests whether by resolving problems that cannot be resolving unilaterally or by reducing transaction costs through cooperation (Fidler, 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 352, "text": "Smith (2009, pp. 143, 149)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 729, "end": 765, "text": "(Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, p. 912", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1224, "text": "(Ruggie, 1998, p. 867, emphasis added)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1453, "text": "(Zacher and Keefe, 2008, p. 20)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1778, "text": "(Fidler, 2004, p. 8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2107, "text": "(Fidler, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SARS and the Duty to Report"}, {"text": "Under the leadership of the WHO Headquarters in the mid-late 1990s, initiatives such as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria achieved political and donor support that was relatively unprecedented (Lee et al, 2002; Ricci, 2009) . From this perspective, the IHR revisions were just one of the several recent examples of states agreeing to sacrifice portions of their sovereign privileges by committing themselves to comply with international standard setting.

As the rate of infections The duty to report notwithstanding, there were several prima facie reasons to expect that states would not report H5N1 in a timely manner. First, states were not legally required to do so for the first three and a half years of the outbreak, as such governments might have been expected to comply only with their formal legal obligations (Lee and Fidler, 2007, p. 220) . Second, the financial costs associated with confirming H5N1 outbreak, especially the destruction of poultry stocks and associated farming livelihoods, posed a major deterrent to reporting (Scoones and Forster, 2010) . Third, these financial costs would also create additional political costs by devastating already vulnerable communities and placing intense pressure on governments to compensate and provide reassurances to save affected industries (Forster, 2010; Herington, 2010; Safman, 2010; Vu, 2010) . Despite these barriers, the literature has characterised the reporting behaviour of affected states as falling into one of the three categories: those that positively complied (Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia), those that did so more shakily (China, Thailand) and those that outwardly challenged the duty to report itself (Indonesia, Thailand). The general observation has been that the deterrents did not wholly inhibit reporting, but there were variations in how states understood their duty to report. Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia were generally viewed as being positive, and presented as evidence of states embracing the need to engage in the global health governance framework to ensure greater assistance in identifying and preventing the outbreaks (de Sa et al, 2010) . When inevitable delays in reporting was noted in these countries, it was reported as being due to capacity failures rather than direct political intent to deceive the international community or domestic audiences about the extent of the outbreak (Boltz et al, 2006; Ear, 2010; Herington, 2010; Coker et al, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 565, "end": 595, "text": "(Lee and Fidler, 2007, p. 220)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 786, "end": 813, "text": "(Scoones and Forster, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1062, "text": "(Forster, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1079, "text": "Herington, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1093, "text": "Safman, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1103, "text": "Vu, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1879, "text": "(de Sa et al, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2147, "text": "(Boltz et al, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2148, "end": 2158, "text": "Ear, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2175, "text": "Herington, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2194, "text": "Coker et al, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H5N1 -Outbreak and Response"}, {"text": "At the same time, other states were criticized for their failure to adhere to the new duty to report, in particular prompt reporting and verification to the WHO of suspected outbreaks.

Major concerns arose when Indonesia refused to share samples of the H5N1 virus from January 2007. Before this, it had been a long standing practice, as the creation of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) under the WHO's management in 1951, for states to share their influenza virus strains with all WHO collaborating laboratories (located in selected national laboratories) to allow them to assist with the production of vaccines and monitoring of virus strain mutation. Indonesia's refusal to share strains via the GISN raised concerns about the potential for states to assert 'viral sovereignty' as a way of reasserting themselves in the face of global health governance (Holbrooke and Garrett, 2008; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009 , pp. 1386 -1387 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 180, "text": "(1969 or 2005 versions)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 298, "end": 326, "text": "(Stevenson and Cooper, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 327, "end": 339, "text": "Smith, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1057, "text": "(Holbrooke and Garrett, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1084, "text": "Stevenson and Cooper, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1095, "text": ", pp. 1386", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1101, "text": "-1387", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H5N1 -Outbreak and Response"}, {"text": "The Indonesian Ministry of Health argued that it withheld the virus samples because virus sharing was unjust when the supplying country could not be guaranteed equitable access to vaccine and antiviral treatment from the developed countries that primarily manufactured these products on the basis of the viruses freely given (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Eighteen months later, in June 2008 (and a year after the IHR [2005] had come into force) then Indonesian Health Minister Dr Siti Fadilah Supari further questioned whether the government should even regularly report H5N1 human infections to the WHO (Branswell, 2008) . 5 Dr Supari's suggestion was seen as a significant challenge to the duty to report. However, in their written justification over the virus-sharing dispute, the Indonesian Ministry of Health did not refer to Dr Supari's comments regarding the IHR. The Ministry argued that their primary concern in terms of IHR reporting was the government's decision to conduct case confirmation within country rather than sending samples to a WHO collaborating laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Although the Ministry did apparently delay announcing some H5N1 human infections, particularly during 2009 where there are no details on such outbreaks on the WHO's Disease Outbreak News (DON) Website, the WHO Headquarters has continued to argue that it was promptly informed by the government of every outbreak during this period (Branswell, 2008 , Interview, 2011d . Indeed, the Indonesian government immediately supplied confirmation of two H5N1 human cases days after Dr Supari's comments (Reuters, 2008) . Nonetheless, Dr Supari's actions concerning virus samples and musings on the IHR gained support from other member states in the 'developed South' and particularly Asia sparking discussions about 'developing countries [being] increasingly suspicious' of the global health security initiative that inspired the IHR revisions (Aldis, 2008) .

The first concern was that the securitized rhetoric attached to emerging infectious diseases since the 1990s had been accepted so readily that states were coming to view it as legitimate to (re)assert their sovereign right over their reporting behaviour, response and control of specimens. When disease outbreaks were associated with great economic costs -as was the case for Indonesia and other affected states -states were encouraged by securitization to respond through a security lens and privilege unilateral action over multilateral cooperation (Calain, 2007; Elbe, 2010; Forster, 2010 ; on costs see Coker et al, 2011) .

Realizing that they were the likely 'losers' in this international race, some developing countries began to openly question the benefits of maintaining existing forms of international health cooperation. (Elbe, 2010, p. 476) The second explanation was that 'WHO illustrated during the SARS crisis what leadership in global health looks like in a post-Westphalian world', that H5N1 reaffirmed that this had the potential to not just be an anomaly, and that this had prompted some states to respond by protecting their sovereignty from what they now viewed as a sustained attack (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009, p. 1390) . According to this line of thinking, the assertion of 'viral sovereignty' during H5N1, predominantly led by Indonesia but with the tacit support of the region (Fidler, 2010a, p. 288) , could be understood as a statement (predictable perhaps as noted by Smith, 2012 ) that states could question their duty to report to the WHO in the manner proscribed and expected. It has also been argued that the significance of WHA resolutions has been overstated. For example, WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) only called for states to 'voluntarily' comply with the revised IHR in their response to H5N1; regardless of the phrase adopted, WHA resolutions are not legally binding resolutions (Irwin, 2010, p. 9 ). The Indonesian-led opposition may also be interpreted as an inevitable backlash against what many saw as the WHO overstepping its role in 2003 during the SARS crisis (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . From this perspective, the cooperation enjoyed during the SARS crisis was a product of exceptional circumstances and outside that context states would revert to type and seek to control outbreak news and manage their own response to outbreak events (Smith, 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 486, "text": "(Elbe, 2010, p. 476)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 839, "end": 853, "text": "(Stevenson and", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 854, "end": 876, "text": "Cooper, 2009, p. 1390)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1060, "text": "(Fidler, 2010a, p. 288)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1142, "text": "Smith, 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1568, "text": "(Irwin, 2010, p. 9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1766, "text": "(Cortell and Peterson, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2031, "text": "(Smith, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H5N1 -Outbreak and Response"}, {"text": "There are, however, at least three problems with these dominant understandings of how East Asian states responded to the H5N1 outbreak. First, adherents to this line of thinking need to explain why sovereignty concerns seemed to matter more for some states than for others. As I noted earlier, Indonesia and Thailand are assumed to be more protective of their sovereignty than both Cambodia and Vietnam. Given regional similarities in their dispensations towards sovereignty and the fact that the latter countries have been subjected to conflict and external aggression in the past few decades, the norm of sovereign non-interference alone cannot explain the variance in their behaviour (Vu, 2011) . Second, too much weight is given to Dr Supari's comments and there is little evidence to suggest that they were part of a more concerted push against the duty to report or other global health governance norms. Supari's (speculative) comments were offered once in an interview given only 1 year before she stepped down as Health Minister. Beyond this, there is no other prima facie evidence that Indonesia proved more resistant to promptly reporting H5N1 outbreaks to the WHO authorities. Third, and crucial for establishing the second point, claims about the sovereignty backlash are made in the absence of empirical evidence about what states actually did in terms of their reporting behaviour of H5N1 human infections from 2004 to 2010. Establishing the reporting behaviour of H5N1 affected states over a sustained period of time, rather than providing selective snapshots, will go a long way to establishing whether states have in fact modified their behaviour in line with shared expectations about the prompt reporting of diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 687, "end": 697, "text": "(Vu, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H5N1 -Outbreak and Response"}, {"text": "This section examines the extent to which East Asian states complied with the duty to report by examining every report of H5N1 infection in the region between 2004 and 2010, noting not just official (government) confirmations of outbreaks, but the outbreak reports provided to the WHO by governments. Because of the variation in languages and different styles of reporting outbreaks via official Ministry of Health Websites (that is, some states report weekly or monthly, some report all immediate suspect outbreaks, some only report laboratory confirmed outbreaks), I examined the public communication of outbreak events by all states that recorded H5N1 human infections in the East Asian region between 2004 and 2010 via one disease monitoring website, ProMED Mail (PMM). 6 I then compared the reports for each case under PMM with the issuing of WHO alerts on the same outbreak that are usually released by the government for the WHO to then post on its DON site. 7 PMM is one of the oldest (created 1994) independent (non-state managed) publicly available International Surveillance and Response Programs, with a high correlation between its initial reports and event verification (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Hitchcock et al 2007) . It has strong moderator presence and access to subscribers who provide important insight into outbreak events that may have otherwise been overlooked if not for these 'insider informants' using PMM to communicate outbreak events (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Brownstein et al, 2008) . Although the moderated service of PMM means that there is the potential for a report to be discarded because of the moderator believing it not to be relevant, or for a disease outbreak to be missed because the system does not use a text mining tool (that sifts news media source providers such as FACTIVA), PMM has been widely acknowledged as often pre-empting WHO receipt of reports, and accurately reporting outbreak events confirmed by the WHO (Madoff and Woodall, 2005, pp. 725-727; Conway et al, 2010) . 8 Table 2 details how the reports were identified and the countries for which reports were collected. I compared reports of H5N1 human infections on PMM with WHO receipt of reports, over a 6-year time span to indicate how states actually behaved in relation to the putative reporting duties. Within the PMM reports I noted whether there was a high volume of 'informal' reports or 'rumours' being circulated about any particular outbreak that was not confirmed by the government. The number of rumours per year per country were so low that I did not include this data. In sum, PMM reports detected nearly all outbreak reports attracted government response.

This is of note considering that the IHR did not come into force until mid-2007, and as noted by others, prompt compliance with the IHR prompt reporting procedure was voluntary under WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) at this time (Irwin, 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 540, "text": "WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 554, "end": 567, "text": "(Irwin, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 47, "end": 59, "text": "Figures 1-3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Tracing H5N1 Reporting Behaviour"}, {"text": "The core findings from my data set are threefold. First, Figure 1 demonstrates that the East Asian region had a steady reporting pattern that correlated closely with the number of cases in the region for that period, as shown in Figure 2 . In 2005 and 2006, the peak years for H5N1 human infection cases, affected governments were issuing regular updates of outbreaks. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the number of reports that the government were issuing and the confirmations by the WHO (which can only be publicly provided after receipt of government information). In 2005, there were only 10 official reports concerning outbreak events that were not published on the WHO Website -this is for all the three governments that had human infections that year (Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam). In 2006, there were only eight official reports released by the five governments that experienced outbreaks, which were not published on Vietnam. In addition, countries that did not have a case threshold of 5 or above were excluded (that is, Lao PDR, Myanmar); Cambodia was included due to regularly reporting for nearly all of the years examined. Finally, Bangladesh has reported human infection cases, but I have excluded them from this analysis due to case threshold. the WHO site. By 2008, the gap had narrowed to one official report that was either not sent on to the WHO, or the WHO opted not to publish on the DON site. Notably, in the light of the discussion in the previous section, this was in the same year that the Indonesian government -which accounts for the majority of cases in that year -discussed withholding reports. In sum, reports to the WHO were regular -both before the IHR coming into force and afterwards -and states always outpaced the WHO in their official reports of cases. There was only two instances (on 6 January 2005 and 16 June 2005) when the WHO reported on its DON site H5N1 outbreaks not yet confirmed by the state -Vietnam. Moreover, it appears that the mid-2007 date for when the IHR revisions came into force did not have any discernible effect on reporting, suggesting that the duty to report was in play before the IHR coming into formal effect. A second important finding is that those states critiqued for possible noncompliance with their duty to report -China, Indonesia and Thailand -were found to be reporting regularly. Of course, there are attendant questions surrounding the validity of the data and what it is actually telling us. Most notably, are states pre-empting media releases or controlling them (Davies, 2012) ? This is obviously very difficult to measure, but the possibility that reporting is largely controlled by the state should not be excluded. Nonetheless, it appears that the international attention attached to H5N1 cases led to a concerted effort by states to be seen as on the frontlines in response (Coker et al, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2563, "end": 2577, "text": "(Davies, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2879, "end": 2898, "text": "(Coker et al, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 57, "end": 65, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 229, "end": 237, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Tracing H5N1 Reporting Behaviour"}, {"text": "The third important finding was the variation of state reporting behaviour beyond the graphs shown here. There were several important inconsistencies. Whereas Cambodia, China and Thailand released official reports that closely correlated with the WHO's confirmation of received reports from these countries (variation was no more than one case difference), Indonesia and Vietnam showed variation at different times. Indonesia had a strong reporting relationship with the WHO during the early phase of the outbreak. From 2007, variation started to emerge. In 2007, 5 reports were not passed on to WHO (or not reported), in 2008 there were 3, in 2009 there were 4 and then in 2010 there were 4 government reports that were again not published on WHO site. Both the WHO Office in Indonesia (who reports cases to the WHO Headquarters) and the Indonesian Health Ministry have argued that these discrepancies between what the Indonesian government was reporting and WHO site was listing as confirmed outbreaks was a product of the WHO Headquarters being informed but choosing not to publish the information (Interview, 2011c). A less official line expressed in a separate interview was that the WHO Office staff in Indonesia, during the public dispute with Dr Supari from 2006-2009 and prior to her stepping down, were always promptly informed but requested from 2008 that the WHO Headquarters not immediately publish all outbreak events online (Interview, 2011d) . What is remarkable about this less official explanation is that the Indonesian Health Ministry officials still sought to inform the WHO of outbreaks (possibly without the Health Minister's permission), even during the height of the dispute, and the Ministry officials appeared to trust the WHO officials sufficiently to continue reporting information it did not want publicized.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1439, "end": 1457, "text": "(Interview, 2011d)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tracing H5N1 Reporting Behaviour"}, {"text": "In the case of Vietnam, viewed as a 'positive' reporting case, the earlier phase of reporting from the government to the WHO was more sporadic -more than even at the height of the 'dispute' between Indonesia and the WHO. In 2005, the government reported 21 cases but the WHO issued only 12 reports. As noted earlier, two of these 12 reports were issued by the WHO without first confirming their existence from the government. From 2007 onwards, the correlation between the WHO and the government reports is almost identical, with only a difference of one case in some years. What is also very interesting about the Indonesia and Vietnam cases has been the strong emphasis in the literature that Indonesia's behaviour is a 'soverignty' or 'securitization' backlash; while Vietnam has been acquiesant. These findings reveal that even at the height of dispute between the WHO and Indonesian government reporting remained strong in comparison to the relationship between the WHO and Vietnam (viewed for the most part in positive terms). Despite significant differences between what Vietnam was obviously experiencing but not communicating to the WHO in the earlier years of the outbreak, there was little suspicion attached to this country's motivations. Whereas, the honesty of the Indonesian government was questioned, it seems, solely on the statements of the Health Minister in 2008. The lack of concern about Vietnam is all the more interesting given that the country's lack of freedom of the press means, in contrast with Indonesia's freer media structures, that there is little in the way of an informal reporting structure to keep the government 'accountable' (for example, Vu, 2010; Interview, 2011b; Davies 2012 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1678, "end": 1687, "text": "Vu, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1705, "text": "Interview, 2011b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1717, "text": "Davies 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tracing H5N1 Reporting Behaviour"}, {"text": "In the aftermath of SARS and the IHR (2005) revisions, the WHO Headquarters argued in the 2007 World Health Report that 'in an electronically transparent world where outbreaks are particularly newsworthy events, their concealment is no longer a viable option for governments' (WHO, 2007, p. 13) .

Instead, East Asian states have demonstrated a strong interest in being seen as competent handlers of the outbreak, partly because of external funding attached to pandemic response and partly because of political interest in responding to an outbreak that was crippling poultry industries around the region (Coker et al, 2011) .

The question is whether these inconsistencies illustrate a failure to reconstruct the external norm, resulting in reassertions of sovereignty, or whether they were simply products of states interpreting the norm and adapting it to their context and circumstance (Davies, 2011) . For instance, Dr Supari's comments and actions regarding virus sharing did not alter the actual reporting relationship between the WHO Headquarters and Indonesian Health Ministry. Even though Figure 3 appears to show the Indonesian government not passing its reports on to the WHO, we know from reports that outbreak information was shared (Reuters, 2008) . Interviews with key stakeholders from the Indonesian government, the WHO Office in Jakarta and the WHO Headquarters (Interview, 2008; Interview, 2011a; Interview, 2011c; Interview, 2011d) 9 have confirmed that officials-level practice of reporting and verifying was not affected by the political debates about virus sharing and reporting. Political sensitivity amended how the reports were communicated, but the reporting relationship remained intact. The 'international' duty to report was amended to reflect local needs and priorities, but it was not breached. The same explanation has been expressed regarding earlier discrepancies between Vietnam's official reports and the WHO's reports of H5N1 (Interview, 2011b). Moreover, in the case of Vietnam and Indonesia, some delays in reporting appeared to be largely rooted in difficulty communicating outbreaks via decentralized health channels and poorly equipped laboratories outside of capitals (Forster, 2010; Vu, 2010) . It is of note that IR appreciations of the H5N1 case have emphasized sovereign obfuscation over sovereign capacity to meet the duty to report for explaining state behaviour during H5N1 (Davies, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 383, "end": 397, "text": "(Davies, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 740, "end": 755, "text": "(Reuters, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 874, "end": 891, "text": "(Interview, 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 892, "end": 909, "text": "Interview, 2011a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 910, "end": 927, "text": "Interview, 2011c;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 928, "end": 945, "text": "Interview, 2011d)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1721, "text": "(Forster, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1731, "text": "Vu, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1933, "text": "(Davies, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 12, "end": 20, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 592, "end": 600, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Post-Westphalia and Localization"}, {"text": "Do these findings suggest that the post-Westphalians were right all along?

In other words, the way in which this duty is interpreted and implemented will depend on how it is affected by resource constraints, political systems, political instabilities, natural disasters and crises, and other cherished principles. All of this creates the potential for backtracking when circumstances persuade states that non-compliance would serve them better than compliance.

Amitav Acharya (2009, p. 5) has noted in the case of Asia, 'new international norms do not enter into a local normative vacuum'. Sometimes new norms can amplify local norms or be made to fit local norms with some form of normative compromise. This normative compromise is evident in the region in relation to the duty to report. Of course, in East Asia, sovereignty and non-interference remain sacrosanct, but the way in which these principles are understood is changing to permit some degree of sovereign responsibility (Bellamy and Davies, 2009 ).

Calls for its revision had successfully led to a unanimous resolution on the matter in the 1995 World Health Assembly. However, the revision process had experienced some lag in momentum before SARS in 2003 (Kamradt-Scott, 2010). 2 The first appearance of H5N1 in poultry livestock was in Hong Kong in 1997, which also led to the infection of six people (from direct poultry contact). I explain below the importance attached to how human transmissions occur. 3 A PHEIC is defined in Article 2, IHR (2005) as involving the 'international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade'. Annex 2 provides the criteria states are to use for assessing whether an outbreak is a potential PHEIC (WHO [2008] : Annex 2). 4 There have been isolated cases of suspected human transmission, in Vietnam (2004) and Indonesia (2006) .
