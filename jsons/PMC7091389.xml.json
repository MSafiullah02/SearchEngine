Several snoRNAs and snoRN proteins (RNPs) are known to be needed for processing of ribosomal RNA, but precise functions remain to be defined. In principle, snoRNAs could have several roles in ribosome synthesis including folding of pre-rRNA, formation of rRNP substrates, catalyzing RNA cleavages, base modification, assembly of pre-ribosomal subunits, and export of product rRNP particles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.",

The story of siRNAs began with the observation of pigment expression in the Petunia plant. van der Krol et al. [11] tried to intensify flower pigmentation by introducing additional genes, but unexpectedly observed reduced floral pigmentation in some plants, suggesting that gene silencing may be involved in naturally occurring regulation of gene function. This introduction of multiple transgenic copies of a gene into the Petunia plant resulted in gene silencing of not only the transgenic, but also the endogenous gene copy, as has been observed by others [12]. This suggests co-suppression of homologous genes (the transfer gene and the endogenous gene) and possible methylation are involved [12, 13]. This phenomenon is termed RNAi. Note that the transgene introduced to the Petunia plant is a dsRNA, which is perfectly complementary to the target gene.",

RNAi is a mechanism by which small regulatory RNAs possessing a sequence complementary to that of a portion of a target gene interferes with the expression of that gene. It is thought that the dsRNA, once it enters the cells, is cut up by an RNAseIII-familial endonuclease, known as Dicer. Dicer consists of an amino terminal helicase domain, a PAZ domain, two RNAse III motifs, and a dsRNA binding motif. Therefore, Dicer binds to the dsRNA and excises the dsRNA into siRNA. These siRNAs locate other single-stranded RNA molecules that are completely complementary to either strand of the siRNA duplex. Then, the RNA-degrading enzymes (RNAses) destroy the RNAs complementary to the siRNAs. This phenomenon is also named post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or transgene quelling. In other words, gene silencing can be activated by introducing transgenes, RNA viruses, or dsRNA sequences that are completely complementary to the targeted gene transcripts.",

First, miRNA is generated as a long primary precursor miRNA (pri-miRNA), most likely mediated by RNA polymerases type II (Pol-II) [41, 42]. The pri-miRNA is transcribed from the genome. Second, the long pri-miRNA is excised by Drosha-like RNase III endonucleases and/or spliceosomal components to form the \u223c60\u201370 nt precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA exhibits considerable secondary structure including regions of imperfectly paired dsRNA, which are sequentially cleaved to one or more miRNAs. This step depends on the origin of the pri-miRNA, whether located in an exon or an intron respectively [41, 42]. Third, the pre-miRNA is exported out of the nucleus by Ran-GTP and a receptor, Exportin-5 [25, 43]. In the cytoplasm, Dicer-like endonucleases cleave the pre-miRNA to form mature 18\u201325 nt miRNA. Lastly, the mature miRNA is incorporated into a ribonuclear particle (RNP) to form the RNA-induced gene silencing complex (RISC) which executes RNAi-related gene silencing [44, 45]. Only one of the two strands is the miRNA; the other counterpart is named miRNA*. The mature miRNA can block mRNA translation based on partial complementarity between the miRNA and the targeted mRNA, particularly via base pairing with the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the mRNA. If there is a perfect complementarity between the miRNA and the targeted mRNA, mRNA degradation occurs similarly to that mediated by siRNA. Auto-regulatory negative feedback via miRNAs regulates some genes, including those involved in the RNA silencing mechanism itself.",

But the link between final miRNA maturation and RISC assembly remains unknown. However, there is evidence that the actions of Dicer and RISC in siRNA and miRNA processing are distinct [27, 28]. In recent studies using zebrafish, it was demonstrated that the stem-loop structure of the pre-miRNAs is involved in strand selection for mature miRNA during RISC assembly. These findings further suggest that the duplex structure of siRNA may not be strictly required for the assembly of miRNA-associated RISC in vivo. Proposed pathways for the biogenesis of miRNA are based on the in vitro model developed for siRNA. For these reasons, future work needs to focus on distinguishing the individual properties and differences in action of Dicer and RISC in siRNA and miRNA processing. Conceivably, siRNA is a defence mechanism against immediate insertion of viral genes or transposons in plants and lower animals. In contrast, miRNA over evolutionary time selects segments of transposons for incorporation into the genome for fine-tuning of gene regulation in vertebrates, including human beings. This hypothesis for the differences between siRNA and miRNA gene silencing may provide a clue toward explaining the prevalence of native siRNAs in invertebrates but relative scarcity in mammals.",

The identified miRNAs usually are more heterogeneous than those discovered experimentally, suggesting traditional cloning has a high false negative or miss rate.

From an evolutionary vantage point, the genome exhibits a remarkable increase in the complexity and variety of introns in higher plants and animals; therefore, the influence of intronic gene regulation to facilitate genome stability and gene coordination progressively increases phylogenetically. Conceivably, dysregulation of intronic miRNAs is highly likely to reveal the interwined actions between intronic miRNA and gene expression, leading to a better understanding of the genetic etiology of human diseases.

The problems in preventing viral infections such as HIV are as follows: first, the global prevalence of epidemic proportions is mainly caused by the high mutation rate of the HIV genome that gradually generates more resistant strains to highly active antiretroviral therapies. Second, the HIV provirus is capable of integrating into a host cellular genome to escape from the inhibitory effects of the treatment, thus inactivating the viral replication cycle rather than destroying the latent viral genome, resulting in an increased number of HIV carriers. Such an increase of drug-resistant HIV strains and their carriers has posed great challenges and financial burdens for the AIDS prevention programs. To alleviate such problems, miRNAs can trigger either translation repression or RNA degradation depending on their degree of complementarity with the target genes. Our approach, using vector-based miRNA, to overcome the complications of HIV mutation is a breakthrough in the field.

SiRNA is likely formed by two perfectly complementary RNAs transcribed from two different promoters (remains to be determined) and further processing into 19\u201322 bp duplexes by the RNase III-familial endonuclease, Dicer. The biogenesis of intergenic miRNAs, e.g., lin-4 and let-7, involves a long transcript precursor (pri-miRNA), which is probably generated by Pol-II or Pol-III RNA promoters, while intronic miRNAs are transcribed by the Pol-II promoters of its encoded genes and co-expressed in the intron regions of the gene transcripts (pre-mRNA). After RNA splicing and further processing, the spliced intron may function as a pri-miRNA for intronic miRNA generation. In the nucleus, the pri-miRNA is excised by Drosha RNase to form a hairpin-like pre-miRNA template and then exported to the cytoplasm for further processing by Dicer* to form mature miRNAs. The Dicers for siRNA and miRNA pathways are different. All three small regulatory RNAs are finally incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains either strand of siRNA or the single-strand of miRNA. The effect of miRNA is considered to be more specific and less adverse than that of siRNA because only one strand is involved. On the other hand, siRNAs primarily trigger mRNA degradation, whereas miRNAs can induce either mRNA degradation or suppression of protein synthesis depending on the sequence complementarity to the target gene transcripts",
