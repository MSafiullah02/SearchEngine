The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established. We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.",

Important ethical considerations are outlined in the recently published article by Emanuel et al. with additional recommendations to prioritize certain groups when constrained by limited resources: Health care workers, sickest first, and youngest first (27) . ELSO has published guidance (23) surrounding use of ECMO during this pandemic that align with these principles -namely, that the highest priority should be given to younger patients, those with minor/no medical co-morbidities and healthcare workers. Outside of this, standard ECMO inclusion/exclusion criteria and COVID-19 protective equipment should be used according to local institutional policies, as there are currently no special precautions recommended for contact (23) . Although there is a theoretical risk of microbial aerosolization in the ECMO membrane oxygenator, this has not yet been substantiated by evidence (28) and we do not recommend any special precautions other than vigilant decontamination and disposal of equipment as governed by local institution and infection control policies.",

That said, this is an evolving situation that may change as more affected patients are expected to require critical care beds in the coming weeks to months. In our current circumstances worldwide -as MacLaren et al. suggest -resources may well be better concentrated to ensure that enough ICU beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment are available to deal with the influx of patients encountered within the coming weeks to months.

Frontline providers of all specialties must stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving literature and be familiar with therapeutic options for COVID-19 infections. VV and VA-ECMO remain a resource-intensive form of respiratory and mechanical circulatory support that can be considered in extreme circumstances. In the present time of global uncertainty with limited evidence to guide care, we must be mindful of balancing resource scarcity (which may be the overwhelming concern for many healthcare systems in the course of this pandemic) with perceived likelihood of benefit as well as the risk of transmission to other patients, healthcare providers and patient-care environments. We anticipate that ECMO-CARD (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease) -an ongoing multicenter prospective observational study of ECMO use in COVID-19 -will inform practice for both VV and VA-ECMO use when it is published (29) .

            "text": "The unprecedented global spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in escalating impact on morbidity and mortality across the world, as well as substantial policy change and strain on existing healthcare infrastructure. Although these figures have not yet been firmly established, a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 observational studies of 2874 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection showed a pooled prevalence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission of 20.3%, shock (unspecified) in 6.2% and a case fatality rate of 13.9% for infected patients (1). Amidst our present struggles to contain the spread of infection and develop a vaccine, researchers have yet to identify beneficial treatments/therapies in managing patients afflicted with COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has also uncovered very salient issues in bioethics including stewardship of scarce resources and provision of care to those most likely to benefit from it. Such dilemmas have already been faced by physicians in Italy who have described \"warlike\" situations in hospitals (2,3). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a resourceintensive form of both respiratory and mechanical circulatory support in the setting of refractory respiratory failure and/or cardiogenic shock (CS), respectively (4). It requires specialized equipment, training (of physicians, nursing staff and perfusionists) as well as delivery of care in specialized critical care units. Despite very poor survival of patients referred for veno-venous (VV) ECMO, interim recommendations from the Chinese (5,6), World Health Organization (WHO) (7) and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (8) suggest referral for VV-ECMO in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and refractory hypoxemia despite conventional therapies (9,10).",

It is of utmost importance to document the presence of both biventricular dysfunction and a hemodynamic profile compatible with CS, as patients with mixed or predominantly vasodilatory shock may be unlikely to benefit from mechanical circulatory support even in the presence of known cardiovascular disease. Although patients with COVID-19 infection are in a pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic state, coagulopathy has been reported in up to one-fifth of cases (9). Hence, vigilant monitoring for both thrombotic complications (intracardiac thrombi, aortic root/aortic valve thrombi, cannula thrombi, thrombosis of oxygenator) and bleeding may be warranted. Lastly, severe cases of COVID-19 tend to present with multi-organ failure. The use of VA-ECMO in such patients, especially in the presence of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by sepsis, may be considered a futile resource-intensive endeavor. Use of validated prognostic scores such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Survival after Veno-arterial ECMO (SAVE) scores together",
