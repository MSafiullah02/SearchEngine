The proportions of patients receiving presatovir who developed LRTC were similar among patients without baseline lymphopenia and in patients without ribavirin use at baseline, as compared to those receiving the placebo (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Overall, ribavirin use was higher among patients who developed an LRTC (37.0%) versus those who did not (23.5%). Patients hospitalized at baseline had a numerically higher rate of LRTCs, relative to those who started treatment as outpatients (18/63 [28.6%] vs 9/113 [8.0%], respectively), and the hospitalization status was imbalanced between the presatovir and placebo arms at baseline. The effects of presatovir versus placebo treatment on the time-weighted average change in the viral load from Day 1 to Day 9 and the occurrence of death or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation through Day 28 were similar between patients hospitalized and not hospitalized on Day 1 (Supplementary Table 6). However, treatment with presatovir, relative to the placebo, was associated with a 28% lower LRTC event rate among patients hospitalized on Day 1 (Table 2; Supplementary Table 6). In other post hoc analyses, the proportion of patients who developed LRTCs was numerically lower following presatovir treatment, as compared to placebo treatment, among patients with shorter than median symptom durations (\u22644 days) and \u2264365 days since HCT (Table 2; Supplementary Tables 6\u20139). A post hoc multivariate Cox proportional hazard model for the time to an LRTC through Day 28 in patients receiving presatovir, adjusted for lymphopenia and ribavirin use on Day 1, enrollment site, and hospitalization status on Day 1, yielded an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, .19\u2013.99; P = .091), as compared to those receiving the placebo. Optional extended RSV monitoring and serologic responses are presented in the Supplementary Results. Patients with treatment-emergent substitutions in RSV F that were associated with presatovir resistance had a numerically smaller change in the time-weighted average RSV load, but not worse clinical outcomes, relative to those with wild-type F sequences; such substitutions occurred at a significantly higher frequency in patients with, versus without, lymphopenia (Supplementary Results; Supplementary Tables 10\u201311).",

Respiratory failure and mortality are more clinically significant, but their rates in this study suggest that the sample size required would be prohibitive, especially for HCT recipients. The current study endpoint of LRTCs included multiple etiologies, because RSV URTIs may predispose patients to secondary infections\u2014for example, by disrupting mucociliary function [29, 30]\u2014so treatment could prevent a secondary LRTI, as well as a primary LRTI. Furthermore, any LRTC is a clinically significant event that may prolong hospitalization, necessitate intensive clinical care (including empiric antimicrobial treatment), and potentially result in death. Only a minority of LRTCs in this study were adjudicated as primary RSV LRTIs\u2014likely due to other etiologies, as well as a lack of lower respiratory tract samples for the confirmation of RSV\u2014underscoring the potential importance of nonviral pulmonary events in HCT recipients with RSV infections. Determining the cause of each LRTC event in a clinical trial, while ideal, requires invasive procedures (eg, bronchoscopy or lung biopsy) that could pose significant patient risks and are not globally mandated by the current clinical standard of care. Thus, radiographic confirmation, corroborated by clinical data with central, blinded adjudication, as used here, may be the best approach to classify LRTIs. Whether the near-50% relative reduction in LRTC events is clinically meaningful, despite lacking statistical significance, is left to interpretation. The consistent trends toward a treatment effect in exploratory analyses need confirmation in future studies.",

Although the coprimary endpoints were not achieved, presatovir treatment was associated with trends toward an antiviral effect and clinical benefit. Similar future trials should judiciously select suitable at-risk patients (ie, patients with lymphopenia, neutropenia, GVHD, or receiving corticosteroids) to maximize the potential benefits. Because having an LRTC increases the mortality risk, prompt diagnoses, early intervention for RSV URTIs in high-risk patients, and effective antiviral agents are imperative to improve clinical outcomes.",
