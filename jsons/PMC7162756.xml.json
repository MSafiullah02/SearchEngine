Universal health care protects everyone by assuring that no one is blocked from getting care because of unaffordable out of pocket costs. As the only developed nation that has failed to provide such protection and where a growing population of 27.9 million are uninsured and roughly an equal number have inadequate coverage that still makes essential care unaffordable, we face greater risks.1 Fifty-one percent of the un-insured population are either African American or Hispanic. The uninsured are more likely to delay testing and treatment. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, this exposes everyone- insured, uninsured, rich, poor and all racial and ethnic categories to greater risks. Proposals to address this vulnerability have been dead on arrival since before the last deadly pandemic swept across this country in 1918. The reason for the deaths of these proposals is so embedded into the structure of our existing health system that it tends to be overlooked. It is a way of thinking about the organization and financing of health care that evolved in the wake of the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court \u201cseparate but equal\u201d decision in 1896 that justified segregating services by race and privilege.2\n,\n3\n,\n4 Jim Crow laws in the South, residential segregation laws in the North and patterns of medical practice that evolved adapting to these conditions shaped the development of our modern health system.5\n,\n6 While the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision rejected the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d argument, an accumulation of even less plausible euphemisms as strategies for preserving the segregated status quo left the health system largely unchanged.",

The American Association of Labor Legislation (AALL) during World War I sponsored state legislation to provide health care to industrial workers supported by matching funds from the state, the employers and the employees that had the muted support of organized medicine's national leadership.7 Lodges had already begun providing such protection for their members and objected. They contracted with physicians to provide care for their members for a fixed amount per year. Despite the opposition of local medical societies, this approach to assuring access to care grew rapidly and many assumed it was the way most care would be financed in the future.8 They saw no reason to undermine their influence in recruiting new members by substituting \u201ccompulsory governmental paternalism for private voluntary fraternalism.\u201d It was also easy to appeal to the broader aversion to racial and ethnic mixing that state legislation implied.",
