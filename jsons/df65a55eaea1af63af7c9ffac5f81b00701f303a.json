Since anemia decreases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, and thereby oxygen delivery to the tissues, augmentation of oxygen delivery with RBC transfusion appears appropriate. The goal of RBC transfusion is to maintain adequate tissue oxygen delivery (DO 2 ). Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac output (CO) and arterial oxygen content (CaO 2 ).

Acute or uncompensated anemia causes tissue hypoxia not only as a result of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, but also as a result of decreased cardiac output from defi cient preload. In order to maintain oxygen delivery, tissues will compensate for reductions in oxygen carrying capacity by increasing regional blood fl ow. Most tissues are also able to increase oxygen extraction in response to decreased oxygen delivery. While the cardiac circulation has extremely high oxygen extraction ratio at rest (60-77%), its vasodilatory capacity in response to increased demand is limited. Under normal physiologic conditions, the heart relies on sympathetic discharge, increasing myocardial contractility, heart rate, and systemic vascular tone to further compensate for decreased oxygen delivery. When there is left ventricular dysfunction and/or coronary artery disease, the ability of the heart to increase cardiac output and coronary artery blood fl ow in response to severe anemia is compromised. Thus, anemia is poorly tolerated in the setting of cardiovascular disease.",

Today \"cellular nutrients\" are added, increasing the lifespan of the stored product from 15 to 35-42 days. Nonetheless, RBCs stored ex vivo still undergo biochemical and morphological changes (RBC storage lesion) that hinder RBC transport and oxygen delivery. During storage, the erythrocyte is deprived of energy and a series of morphological changes occur including the loss of the normal biconcave disc shape with crenation and spicule formation producing echinocytes. The swelling of echinocytes forms spheroechinocytes. Eventually, the cell sheds its spicules as lipid vesicles and spherocytes are formed. Spherocytes, with their low surface to volume ratio, are unable to deform and transverse the microcirculation, and their increased osmotic fragility results in hemolysis. In addition, endogenous antioxidants are lost resulting in damage to cytoskeletal proteins and membrane phospholipids. Hemoglobin is also converted to methemoglobin which cannot bind oxygen.

Tissue thromboplastins and plasminogen activators are released when tissue is devitalized, triggering the coagulation cascade and the consumption of coagulation factors. Trauma and burn patients with extensive tissue injury often develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during which their coagulation proteins are consumed. Hypothermia, which often develops in these patients, inhibits serine protease activity leading to decreased activation of coagulation factors and prolongation of the PT and PTT. Severe sepsis may also activate the coagulation cascade causing a consumptive coagulopathy and/or DIC.",

However, treating donors with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and corticosteroids prior to leukapheresis has been shown to elevate donor PMN counts and to increases PMN collection yields. The most costeffective regimen for increasing PMN mobilization in donors appears to be a single dose of G-CSF, 450 m g subcutaneously, plus dexamethasone 8 mg po 12 h prior to leukapheresis. Most transfusion centers rely on continuous-fl ow centrifugation leukapheresis for granulocyte collection. The current goal is to transfuse the PMNs immediately after leukapheresis; yet there is some evidence to suggest that granulocytes can be safely stored for up to 24 h.

A solute load of such magnitude may lead to an osmotic diuresis, altered cerebral microcirculation, and renal toxicity in the small infant. Therefore, alternative RBC preservatives have been developed for use in neonates. AS-1 (750 mg/100 mL mannitol and 27 mg/100 mL adenine) and AS-3, (30 mg per 100 mL of adenine, but no mannitol) are safe for small volume (5-15 mL/kg) transfusions in neonates.",

In children with cyanotic cardiac lesions secondary to intracardiac right to left shunts, chronic hypoxia promotes increased erythropoiesis to maintain tissue oxygen delivery. Postoperatively, these children have been managed historically with the goal of maintaining higher hemoglobin concentrations in order to ensure adequate tissue oxygen delivery. This practice is now being questioned as the risks of RBC transfusions are increasingly recognized. Adult and pediatric studies have found independent association between increased number of RBC transfusions and worse clinical outcomes following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Additionally, over-correction should be avoided since polycythemia may actually decrease oxygen delivery. Polycythemia may result in \"sludging\" of the red cell mass at the capillary level thereby impeding blood fl ow to distal tissues. The only prospective study exploring RBC transfusion strategies in children with single ventricle physiology undergoing palliative procedures focused on infants and children undergoing bi-directional Glenn and Fontan procedures. Children managed with a restrictive transfusion strategy appeared no different from those maintained at higher hemoglobin levels.

Individual physiology, the degree of cyanosis, and post-operative hemodynamic instability may further contribute to the coagulopathy experienced by these children.

Systemic venous blood (typically from a right atrial venous cannula) is drained from the patient and travels through a membrane oxygenator. A nonpulsatile roller pump then returns oxygenated, re-warmed blood to the patient via an arterial or venous cannula. Much like cardiopulmonary bypass, maintaining a balance between hemorrhagic complications and circuit thrombosis remains a challenge while providing ECMO support. Patients on ECMO are maintained on a heparin infusion to prevent clotting of the circuit and activated clotting time (ACT) is followed closely with a goal between 180 and 220 s. Despite anticoagulation with a heparin infusion, careful replacement of coagulation proteins with FFP and cryoprecipitate is essential, as the bypass circuit incites a consumptive coagulopathy which can be predictive of intracranial hemorrhage.

The hemostatic defect associated with renal failure is multifactorial.

The management of bleeding in the uremic patient includes increasing von Willebrand factor (vWF) to improve platelet dysfunction. Historically, the use of cryoprecipitate for this indication has been replaced by intravenous DDAVP which stimulates the release of Factor VIII and vWF from endothelial cells.

The main drawback to using erythropoietin therapy in the critically ill patient is the length of time between administration and the resultant marrow response (weeks). In fact, a recent, multicenter study demonstrated that the widespread use of erythropoietin would have little impact on the transfusion requirements of children admitted to the PICU.

Her most current cell counts are white blood cell count 3,500/ m L, hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL and platelets 11,000/ m L. Her PT/PTT and INR are within normal limits. She has oozing around her broviac catheter. A transfusion of platelets is ordered. The most correct statement regarding the impending transfusion is: A. One unit of platelets typically raises the platelet count by approximately 25,000-30,000/ m L B. Platelet apheresis allows multiple units of platelets to be collected from a single donor, thereby reducing the risk of alloimmunization.C. Unlike packed red cell transfusions, platelets transfusions do not produce transfusion-related allergic reactions. D. Refrigeration of platelets allows for safe serial transfusion from the same unit. E. Spleen sequestration of transfused platelets rarely occurs and is not a cause of a poor response to platelet transfusion.",
