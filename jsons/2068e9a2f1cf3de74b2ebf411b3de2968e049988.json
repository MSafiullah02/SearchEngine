In our specific case, illustrated in Supplementary Methods, we added the classes of Positive tested, Undetected infected and, both for detected and undetected ones, the two possible ending point, Healing and Death ( Figure 1A ). Disease-specific parameters were derived from the recent literature, including a mean incubation time ( \u22121 ) of 5. We compared available Italian death records data from years 2015-2020 (considering only February and March) and assumed that the increase in deaths registered in 2020 until 28th March in each Italian region is entirely related to the COVID-19 pandemic, even though only a fraction was confirmed as positive. In particular, we estimated that undetected COVID-19 cases in Italy represent 53% of the registered COVID-19 deaths (Table 1) , which is consistent with other scenarios. For instance, on 17th",

This fact supports the use of the Italian estimation for all analyzed countries. Therefore, by combining the background death records data with the measured Na\u00efve Case fatality Rates (nCFRs) up to 10th March, ranging from 2.26% in Germany to 18.27% in Lombardy (Italy), to obtain an aCFR of 1.4% (CI95% 1.2-1.7%) [8] , it is possible to give a reasonable estimate of the proportion of undetected cases in different regions.",

The estimation of the basic reproductive number ( 0 ) was derived from the model through the Next Generation Matrix Method [14] . The contribution of positive detected cases or undetected ones for the generation of secondary cases is weighted to obtain the overall reproductive number ( 0 ), representing the overall number of newly cases generated along the infectious time of an affected case ( Table 1 ). The mean 0 related to detected cases ( 0 ) is 7.5 \u00b1 2.1, the one related to undetected ones ( 0 )15.7\u00b14.5, determining an overall weighted 0 value of 15.1\u00b1 4.3. Figure 3B ). According to our model, there were 2502 (CI 2251-3205) infectious subjects on 7th April, most of those being undetected (96.4%). We show how the infection dynamics depend on the level of target mobility that is restored, compared to the baseline, and on the adoption of personal protective measures. These two factors can make the difference between a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one ( Figure 3B ).",

In particular, the SIR or SEIR compartmental models have the advantage of providing useful insights for health care decision makers and of being easily manageable from a mathematical point of view [2, 20] . Moreover, if adequately calibrated with good literature-based parameters the simplicity of these models can avoid overfitting results [2] .
