Non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly. Over the following two days, oxygenation improved. On day four the patient had a normal respiratory rate, and nasal oxygen supply could be reduced to 2L with SpO2 of 96%. Chest X-ray showed regressive peripheral consolidations in the lungs.

Nevertheless, the disease course stabilized rapidly without occurrence of further organ manifestation. The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex. As an immunomodulatory drug, it retains na\u00efve T cells and central memory T cells within the lymph nodes, thereby preventing autoimmune inflammation in the brain. 4 However, for defending infectious disease antigens, effector memory T cells are pivotal which are less affected by fingolimod treatment. 4 Thus, despite severe lymphopenia, innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV-2 presumably were preserved in our patient. Pathological key-features of COVID-19 in the lung include pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. 5 Interestingly, S1P is a potent angiogenic factor that enhances lung endothelial cell integrity.",

MRI showed cerebral and thoracic demyelinating lesions, and lumbar puncture revealed slight pleocytosis and positive oligoclonal bandings. A diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was established at that time. A sensory relapse followed in 2011. Immunomodulatory therapy with fingolimod was initiated in 2011 and continued until today. Hereunder no further relapses occurred, and no chronic deterioration of neurological symptoms was observed. However, in 2018, cervical MRI revealed a new inflammatory lesion. The patient was under regular clinical and laboratory monitoring (October 2019: Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0; total lymphocytes 0.73/nL [1.22-3.56]).

On admission (day 0), physical examination revealed fever (39.5 \u00b0C) and a respiratory rate of 28/min.

Longterm treatment is associated with a small increase in the risk of herpes virus reactivation and respiratory tract infections. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under Fingolimod treatment have not been described. Methods and results: We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0). Having peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [1.22-3.56]), the patient developed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT.
