            "text": "For around 30 yr, the hybridoma methods of Kohler and Milstein (1) have served as a general method for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The methods are based upon the immortalization of single B lymphocytes taken from a donor and immortalization by fusion with a myeloma cell line. When working with laboratory animals, the B-cell donor must be hyperimmunized with the antigen of interest to ensure that a high proportion of splenic lymphocytes are synthesizing antibody against the intended target. At least in principle, B cells specific for the antigen could be selected before fusion, but in practice this is rarely done. After cell fusion, selection for hybridomas is carried out with drugs that block nucleotide synthesis and salvage; surviving lines are cloned and screened for the synthesis of antibody against the antigen of interest. The system works well but is it labor-intensive and it is difficult to control the precise specificity of antibodies that emerge from screening. More fundamental limitations also exist. Because this method of monoclonal antibody production is founded upon immunization of a donor animal, problems arise in generating antibodies against self antigens (e.g., cell surface markers) or proteins of conserved sequence (e.g., proteins that a near identical between mice and humans). Molecules that are poorly immunogenic because of their structure (e.g., carbohydrates) are similarly problematic, and when mixtures of antigens are used for immunization, the host response is naturally biased to those antigens that are present in highest concentration or are most immunogenic to the host immune system. The method has obvious limitations when toxic molecules are the focus of interest. In a project with periodic or unpredictable requirements for monoclonal antibodies, immunization, fusion and screening must be carried out each time a new reagent is required. This has obvious cost and time implications.",

These methods are founded upon several conceptually simple principles but throughout, are recombinant in their philosophy. This route to monoclonal antibody isolation does not employ full-length antibodies as would be produced by the mammalian immune system \u2013 these can be constructed at a later stage if required \u2013 but instead works with antigen-binding fragments. Typically, these are Fab fragments or single-chain Fv fragments (scFv) (Fig. 34.1). The modest size of these proteins (55 kDa (Fab) and 30 kDa (scFv) versus 150 kDa for a full-length antibody such as IgG) makes possible their routine expression in bacteria. It is important to note however that these fragments retain the ability to interact with antigen, potentially with high affinity.\n",

At the outset, a large library of antigen-binding fragments must be generated. Whilst the material for library construction can be sourced from the lymphoid tissues of animals or human subjects, entirely synthetic libraries have become popular (4\u20136) and have many advantages that are discussed below. Whatever its origin, the library is formed in a bacteriophage system so that each virus within the collection possesses at its surface an antibody fragment with the potential to bind to antigen, and carries within its capsid the coding sequence for that Ig (7,8) (Fig. 34.2). This linkage of phenotype (the ability to interact with a target molecule) and genotype (the coding sequence for the antigen-binding protein) is crucial for what follows.\n",

Note that as libraries can be generated from nonimmunized biological sources or through synthetic means, the term \u201cantigen\u201d can become meaningless and \u201ctarget\u201d describes better the molecule against which antibodies are to be sought. In its simplest form, selection involves coating a plastic surface with the target molecule, and then application of the viral library (8). Those phage that display antibody fragments with affinity for the coated surface become immobilized on the surface; others can be washed away. Recoveries are typically low at this stage of selection so the phage are recovered from the surface, infected into bacteria and thereby replicated to much higher numbers. Through repeated rounds of selection, recovery and amplification, target-binding clones are recovered from the library and enriched for those that are favored by the conditions of selection. At this stage, the antibody fragments are present at the surface of the virus, expressed as fusions to one or other of the components of the viral capsid. This is essential if the antibody is to be displayed at the phage surface. Through simple manipulation, antibody fragment can also be expressed as an independent, freely soluble protein. Guided by a leader peptide (Fig. 34.2), the protein is then exported and released into the bacterial periplasm where folding \u2013 assembly in the case of Fab fragments \u2013 takes place (9,10). Many vectors encode peptide tags to enable purification (e.g., histidine repeats) and detection (e.g., c-myc, Flag) of the translation product (Fig. 34.2).",

            "text": "The characterization of viral clones recovered by phage display can take a number of paths. Firstly, immunoassay with either virus (\u201cphage ELISA\u201d) or the individual protein (\u201csoluble protein ELISA\u201d) can confirm the specificity of an antibody fragment for the target. The natural extension of these experiments is into Western blotting, epitope mapping and the determination of affinity through surface plasmon resonance. By sequencing the reading frame, the antibody fragment can be further characterized to determine the diversity of clones recovered. Purification of soluble antibody enables the biological properties of the protein to be assessed (e.g., seeking the ability of the antibody fragment to inhibit the action of the target molecule or processes in which it is involved). Adaptation of the antibody fragment can take many forms. The natural biological activity of a full length antibody can be restored by recloning the coding sequences into a mammalian expression vector that carries the antibody constant domains (11,12). The capacity of the fragment to bind to target can be harnessed by creating fusions with reporters (e.g., to locate the target molecule in cells (13)), enzymes (e.g., for immunoassays for the target molecule (14)) or bioactive agents (e.g., toxin fusions enable specific elimination of defined populations of cells in vitro or in vivo (15)). With such a range of options, it is little wonder that phage display and recombinant antibody technology has rapidly become a popular experimental technique.",

            "text": "The construction of a custom library takes as its starting point, cDNA from an appropriate biological source that contains a diverse range of Ig transcripts. Many libraries have been prepared from human donors vaccinated against or infected with particular pathogens or their products. For example, Zwick and colleagues have described the isolation (16) and characterization (17) of HIV-neutralizing antibodies derived from an HIV seropositive donor. Equally, the immune response active in patients with a range of syndromes and conditions can be sampled if access to lymphoid tissue can be arranged. Fostieri et al. (18) reported the isolation from myasthenia gravis patients of Fab antibodies the acetylcholine receptor. Note that samples need to be protected against the degradation of RNA on recovery and during storage so snap-freezing and storage at -80\u00b0C, and the use of proprietary protectants (e.g., RNAlater, Ambion) are strongly recommended. Samples from the spleen or lymph nodes are ideal for library construction, but may be hard to obtain from human sources. There may, for example, be ethical, cultural, or legal constraints on access to material from post mortem analysis, or tissues taken during surgery. Informed consent for the sampling of human blood may be easier and there are several reports in the literature of library construction with material sampled in this way (19\u201322). Before embarking on this approach, it is worth considering that the numbers of B lymphoblasts circulating in the blood are relatively low and the appearance of antigen-specific B cells may be transitory after infection, vaccination etc. These factors can constrain the yield of cDNA and the diversity of Ig transcripts for library construction. It is possible to isolate peripheral blood lymphocytes against a purified antigen (23,24) or to expand in vitro small numbers (even single) of B lymphocytes (25) to overcome the first of these issues.",

The CDRs are supported on sequences (framework regions; FRs) that are more conserved in sequence. In the human and murine immune systems, antibody coding sequences are assembled from gene segments in the developing B lymphocyte that are numerous but which can be grouped into smaller numbers of families because of the conservation of the FR sequences (43). In many other species, the antibody repertoires are founded upon more limited use of Ig gene segments or families (44).

            "text": "Phage display vectors have been extensively adapted by different investigators to match individual needs, but the following properties are typical, irrespective of whether scFv or Fab libraries are to be prepared (Fig. 34.2). For display upon filamentous phage, pIII is the preferred anchor (7) and phagemid vectors have superseded the use of viral genomic DNA except for specialist purposes (e.g., multivalent display (45)). This is largely because shifting from single-stranded DNA carried within the viral capsid to an independently replicating, double-stranded plasmid in bacteria (ideal for purification in high yield, restriction analysis, sequencing, and protein expression studies) is extremely straightforward. Aside from a plasmid origin of replication, a selectable marker and viral sequences to enable packaging into virions, these vectors possess a promoter for expression of the cloned antibody sequence (typically p lac for ease of regulation), bacterial leader sequences (e.g., the pelB and ompA leader sequences) and cloning sites for the Ig inserts (Fig. 34.2). Fab display vectors usually carry a simple dicistronic operon for independent expression, translation and export of the heavy and light chain components (e.g., pComb3; (7)). In scFv display vectors, the linker sequence that tethers the VH and VL components can be included in the vector, or introduced by PCR before ligation into the vector. In order that the antibody fragment will be displayed, the Ig sequence lies in-frame with gIII, the coding sequence for pIII, a minor phage coat protein present in five copies at the tip of the assembled virus (Fig. 34.2). The pIII protein mediates infection of the bacterial host by the phage through interaction with the bacterial F pilus and the TolA co-receptor (46). Pioneering work by Smith (47) demonstrated that phage infectivity could be retained even when peptides and proteins were fused to pIII. A range of features may be present in the intervening sequence of the display vector. It has become conventional to include an amber stop codon in this part of the vector (Fig. 34.2) providing the option of expressing an antibody-pIII fusion protein for display in suppressor strains of Escherichia coli (e.g., TG1). Moving the construct into a nonsuppressing bacterial host (e.g., HB2151) then allows expression of the antibody fragment as a soluble protein. The same goal can be achieved with only slightly more effort by excision of the gIII sequence using flanking restriction sites that generate compatible termini, and religation (7). Histidine repeats to facilitate protein purification and tags for immunochemical detection are also common features of this part of the vector (Fig. 34.2).",

Only two viral sequences are present in the vector: gIII and the packaging signal. By adding helper phage (e.g., VCS M13, Stratagene), the full range of viral proteins can be synthesized in the bacterial host, viral assembly can begin, but it is a single-stranded form of the phagemid rather than the helper phage genome that is packaged into progeny phage. Filamentous bacteriophage are not released from E. coli in a catastrophic lytic event (cf phage lambda or the T phages) \u2013 rather, they are extruded as viral proteins accumulate in the inner membrane and assemble to form the capsid. After DNA is packaged into the virion, the capsid is capped with copies of the minor coat protein pIII. This is a crucial stage as regards the formation of a display library. Low level expression of the antibody-pIII fusion from the phagemid is achieved by growth of the bacteria in low concentrations of glucose thereby allowing some expression from the lac promoter. This leads to accumulation of the recombinant protein in the bacterial membrane. As capping takes place, a mixture of pIII proteins \u2013 wild-type pIII encoded by the helper phage and antibody-pIII from the phagemid vector \u2013 are incorporated into the capsid (Fig. 34.2). It is estimated that one or two fusion proteins are most commonly incorporated (48), the balance comprising wild-type pIII. Thus progeny phage carry the phagemid, and display at their surface the encoded antibody fragment. When these events take place across the stock of bacteria transformed with the recovered Ig repertoire, a phage display library results.",

Helper phage such as KM13 have been modified to include a trypsin-sensitive site in pIII (49). Treatment with the enzyme renders them noninfective. When partnered with a display vector that expresses pIII lacking this susceptibility, proteolysis can be used to inactivate any phage that lack antibody at their surface. An alternative approach is mutation of the helper phage such that it carries a truncated version of gIII that is unable to contribute to the infection process (50).",

Although more costly and time-consuming, this approach has several significant advantages over restriction analysis. The extent and location of diversity can be thoroughly assessed. If some amplicons from repertoire recovery are disproportionately represented in the library, this can be identified. The degree of diversity present in the library can also be assessed. Perhaps the most important benefit of sequencing is that the reading frames in the library can be checked for integrity. cDNA prepared from lymphoid tissue will include transcripts from B cells undergoing somatic hypermutation, a process with the capacity to introduce stop codons and (more rarely) shifts in the reading frame. Similarly, the use of PCR for repertoire recovery will introduce errors with low frequency. For synthetically diversified libraries, stop codons will be introduced a higher frequency. An alternative method that can be employed to check for the integrity of the reading frame is to pick clones at random from the library and after appropriate manipulation (see the following), check for the expression of soluble, recombinant antibody by capture ELISA, dot blotting or Western blotting.",

This is an application of the \u201cpanning\u201d methods originally devised by Smith (51). As in most immuno-chemical procedures, the surface needs to be blocked to minimize nonspecific binding of library phage. To avoid capturing phage that bind to the blocking reagent, the blocker (often skimmed milk, but purified proteins like serum albumin or gelatine are also used) is preincubated with the phage stock. This reduces substantially the chances of interaction with blocking protein present at the selecting surface. The number of phage added to the surface usually ensures that each specificity calculated to exist in the library is represented several thousand-fold, allowing ample opportunity for recovery. After incubation, the surface is washed rigorously and those phage that remain attached are recovered. Recovery can be though change in the pH (48), the addition of mild chaotropic agents (5) or proteases for those phage systems that are appropriately adapted (see description of KM13 above (49)). Whilst elution must break the interaction between the displayed antibody and the target-coated surface, it must not be so harsh as to impair the ability of virus to infect bacteria.

Firstly, it allows an estimate to be made of the number of virus recovered from selection; as before, this can be done by measuring the frequency with which bacteria are transduced to antibiotic resistance. Secondly, the numbers of phage recovered at the first round of selection are modest (numbers in the range of 103 to 104 are typical) and represent a very low percentage of the input (1010 to 1012). Infection into bacteria, recovery of antibiotic-resistant colonies and reinfection with helper phage allows amplification of the recovered sample to numbers appropriate for a second round of selection. Further rounds often take place on surfaces coated with successively lower concentrations of the target molecule in an effort to refine selection towards those antibodies with the highest affinity of interaction (48). The percentage of phage recovered at each round of selection often climbs sharply from round one to two and further elevation may occur at round 3 (8,51). This can be suggestive of success. Sequencing of clones picked at random through a selection experiment often reveals the emergence of common sequences in the CDRs from collections that initially appear diverse. This indicates that progressive enrichment is taking place during phage selection. It is important to note, however, that this selection is \u201cblind\u201d and that despite careful experimental design, it can drift from the intended direction for a number of reasons. For example, phage that have a low propensity to interact with the selecting surface but are able to replicate quickly will rapidly dominate the output. Similarly, antibodies that react with a contaminant with high affinity rather than the intended target can emerge. Selections that suffer these problems can show all the signs of success as selection proceeds but their failure will only become apparent when tested in immunoassay at a later stage. If these problems arise, again the speed of phage display means that setbacks can be quickly rectified.",

In this instance, expression of the antibody as a monovalent soluble protein fails to generate the signal strength in ELISA that might be expected from initial testing with phage. The final aspect of the technology that needs to be considered is the influence of the bacterial host. Propagation of virus is often carried out in suppressor strains of E. coli (e.g., TG1) to ensure translation of the amber stop codon that (depending upon the vector) may be positioned between the antibody and pIII reading frames. This is essential for synthesis of the fusion protein required for display. In this host background, amber stop codons elsewhere in the reading frame (e.g., located in the CDRs where diversification may have been generated synthetically) will also be translated (56). Phage carrying these sequences may be able to bind to the target biomolecule in ELISA. When the construct is transferred to a nonsuppressing bacterial host (e.g., HB2151), a full-length antibody cannot be formed so once more, clones that appear promising from monoclonal phage ELISA are unreactive at a later stage of their characterization. For all these reasons, it is vital that a significant number of clones are chosen from monoclonal phage ELISA for further characterization, and that this choice does not entirely favor clones that generate the strongest signal in phage ELISA.",

The outcome of the assay will be used to judge if phage recovered from the screen are of the intended specificity: it is therefore vital that the target used for ELISA is as pure as possible or controls are included in the assay to determine if phage have been isolated that are reactive with a (potentially minor) contaminant, the blocking agent used in selection or another component of the selection system (e.g., naked plastic, biotin, streptavidin etc.). On the assumption that clones recovered from selection are of the intended specificity, it may also be possible to assess at this stage if recognition is taking place of a particular feature of the target biomolecule. For example, competitive ELISA with another monoclonal antibody, a ligand or other biomolecule reactive with the target, or peptides derived from the target sequence can be used to good effect. Finally, the coating of the immunoassay surface with different forms of the target (e.g., the native protein if a recombinant form has been used in selection, close homologues of the target perhaps taken from other species, protein that has been modified at a post-translational stage [phosphorylation, glycosylation, addition of fatty acyl moieties]) or chemical derivatives of small target species (e.g., forms of the target that lack particular molecular features, alternative peptide sequences) can help define antibodies that show particular promise at an early stage of their characterization.",

Because the DNA of phagemid display vectors is easily isolated for sequencing, this approach has significant benefits over assessing the diversity of recovered clones by restriction analysis with BstNI or other frequently cutting endonucleases.

Because these enzymes generate compatible termini, the vector fragment is then isolated and re-ligated for expression of the Fab in an E. coli host. Many scFv display vectors possess an amber stop codon between the reading frames for antibody and the phage coat protein (Fig. 34.2).

It is customary to grow the bacteria under glucose repression until adequate biomass has been reached. Removal of the glucose by centrifugation and resuspension in fresh, glucose-free medium containing IPTG inducer then triggers transcription and translation. The choice of growth temperature during the expression phase is important to avoid aggregation of the protein and to minimize toxicity to the bacterial host though some studies suggest that effects on yield can be minimal (58). Expression at 30\u00b0C is often chosen as a starting point. Frequently, overex-pression of the antibody leads to leakage of the periplasmic contents to the culture medium from which the protein can be purified. Purification is aided significantly by the presence of a histidine repeat sequence at the carboxy-terminus of the protein, a feature that is most conveniently incorporated in the original vector. Material generated in this way can be used in immunoassay or blotting, detection being made with Ig-binding proteins such as Protein A, G or L (56) or reagents against the purification and/or other peptide tags (e.g., c-myc, Flag etc.).",

The movement from a suppressor mutant for expression of a scFv-pIII fusion and propagation of phage to a nonsuppressor host for expression of soluble protein can mean that clones that are positive in phage ELISA react poorly when the soluble antibody is expressed (see above). Amber stop codons present in the Ig reading frame will truncate the antibody prematurely in this situation. Some Ig sequences can be expressed more successfully in bacteria than others and whilst some investigations have identified causes for this effect (59), in many cases, they remain unexplained. Clones from custom, immunized libraries may therefore prove difficult to overexpress if they happen to carry problematic framework sequences. It is for this reason that some of the most successful, synthetically diversified libraries are founded upon single frameworks: the framework can be chosen as one that expresses consistently well in a bacterial host (56). The affinity of the antibody-target interaction can also be a relevant consideration (60). Multiple display of an antibody at the phage surface can drive a promising interaction in phage ELISA but when expressed as monovalent soluble protein, constructs with low or modest affinity for the target can give ELISA signals that are close to background.",

Infectious diseases have proved a productive area for investigation and in one example, antibodies against anthrax toxin have been shown to neutralize the lethal properties of this bacterial virulence factor (72). The pathogenesis of established (e.g., rotavirus (73)) and emergent viral agents (e.g., SARS (74,75)) can also be blocked by recombinant antibodies. Antibodies generated in this way have the potential for treatment of acute infection, blocking the disease process at a key point (e.g., interaction between a receptor and the pathogen (76) or its product(s) (72)). This provides a therapeutic option when the use of antibiotics or antiviral compounds is undesirable or impossible (77). It also offers prophylaxis when vaccines are unavailable (78) or the patient is unable to mount a protective response as a consequence of vaccination (79).",
