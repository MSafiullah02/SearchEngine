At the convalescent phase, disease severity-dependent antibody responses emerged and antigen-reactive cells were identified in both T-cell subsets. These T cells belonged to the T-helper 1 or type 1 cytotoxic T cell subtypes. While CD8 + T cells responded preferentially to the viral S protein compared with E/M/N proteins, especially at the acute stage, slightly more CD4 + T cells recognized E/M/N proteins compared with S protein at the convalescent phase.",

While the clinical characteristics of MERS and the biology of the causative virus are well documented [2] , the pathogenesis and host immune response during MERS-CoV infection have been poorly investigated. This has hampered the development of therapeutics and preventive measures. Recent studies have demonstrated that a strong antibody response develops in most patients after 2-3 weeks of illness and that this antibody response is not likely to be correlated with the elimination of the virus from the body [3, 4] .",

Furthermore, T-cell responses to MERS-CoV have been recently measured in MERS survivors at the late convalescent period, and their association with disease course was analyzed [9] . However, information is lacking regarding the T-cell responses in patients at the acute stage of infection. In vitro and animal studies showed that MERS-CoV preferentially infects respiratory epithelial cells and inhibits the type 1 interferon response [10, 11] . CD8 + T cells and antibodies were revealed to participate in clearing the invading MERS-CoV virions and to protect against subsequent infection, respectively [12, 13] . It was also reported that the local immune response likely plays a role in pulmonary pathology severity [14] .

We thus used overlapping synthetic peptides spanning all the 4 structural proteins of MERS-CoV (KOREA/Seoul/014-1-2015, accession number KT374052) as viral antigen to analyze T-cell responses to MERS-CoV. The peptide library comprised 507 peptides consisting of 15-mers overlapping at 11 amino acid residues; the peptides, with >80% purity as determined by mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography, were manufactured by Mimotopes (Australia). We dissolved each peptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 80 mg/mL and pooled those encompassing the viral S protein into 2 sets (S1: 168 N-terminal peptides; S2: 168 C-terminal peptides) and those of the E, M, and N proteins into 1 set (E/M/N: 171 peptides).",

After the addition of 1 \u00b5g/mL brefeldin A (eBiosciences) and 0.7 \u00b5g/mL monensin (BD Biosciences), cells were further incubated for an additional 5 hours. After staining dead cells using LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Molecular Probes), cells were subjected to surface staining with anti-CD3 BV421, anti-CD4 PerCP-Cy5.5, and anti-CD8 allophycocyanin (APC)-H7 mAbs (BD Biosciences). For the detection of antigen-reactive T cells with degranulation activity, anti-CD107a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) mAb (BioLegend) was added to the stimulation cultures, and also used for surface staining. After fixation and permeabilization using the Intracellular Fix and Perm Set (eBiosciences), cells were stained with either set 1 (anti-IFN-\u03b3 PE-Cy7, anti-IL-2 PE, and anti-TNF-\u03b1 APC) or set 2 (anti-IFN-\u03b3 phycoerythrin-cyanine 7 (PE-Cy7), anti-IL-4 PE, anti-IL-10 eFluor660, and anti-IL-17 FITC) mAbs. At least 100 000 stained cells per sample were acquired using a FACSverse Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences), and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon).

As shown for 1 representative patient and a healthy donor, virus-reactive cells were detected in T cells from patients, but not in those from healthy donors ( Figure 3A ). Details of IFN-\u03b3-secreting T-cell frequencies relative to the days after virus exposure and symptom onset in individual patients are provided in Supplementary Figure 3 . In summary, at the acute stage, virus-reactive CD4 + T cells-as determined by the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, or TNF-\u03b1 upon antigenic stimulation-were detected in 2 of the 9 patients in the severe group, but not in the moderate and mild groups ( Figure 3B and 3C) . At the convalescent phase, these CD4 + T cells appeared in most (18/21) of the patients regardless of the severity of infection. Unlike CD4 + T cells, high frequencies (>0.3%) of CD8 + T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF-\u03b1 and expressing CD107a were seen in most (9/12) of the severe and moderate subjects (median for IFN-\u03b3 secretion, 0.94% [range, 0.32%-5.44%]) but not in mild cases at the acute stage of infection. By the convalescent phase, the frequency of these antigen-reactive CD8 + T cells had diminished in a portion (4/7) of the patients with severe or moderate infection ( Figure 3B and 3C) . T cells secreting a cytokine triplet of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF-\u03b1 are considered more potent than those producing 1 or 2 cytokines [20] , and were mostly identified only in CD4 + T cells at the convalescent phase ( Figure 3C ). We also addressed whether MERS-CoV-reactive T cells produced cytokines other than T-helper 1 (Th1) or type 1 cytotoxic T cell (Tc1) types. As expected, IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells were predominant, but IL-4, IL-10, or IL-17-secreting T cells were very rare in both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell populations ( Figure 4 ). Next, we analyzed the reactivity of T cells to different viral proteins. While more CD8 + T cells reacted to S protein than to E/M/N proteins, especially at the acute phase of infection (median, 0.26% [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.03%-0.77%] vs 0.07% [IQR, 0.02%-0.33%]; P < .05), slightly more CD4 + T cells recognized E/M/N than S proteins at the convalescent phase (0.10% [IQR, 0.04%-0.25%] vs 0.09% [IQR, 0.02%-0.21%]; P = .057) ( Figure 5) .",

A significant correlation was also found between the frequencies of virus-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( Figure 6 ). the early period of MERS. Our data revealed that an initial severity-proportional, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine secretion is followed by antibody and T-cell responses in patients, which is a typical host response to many other acute viral infections. However, one peculiar finding was that extraordinarily high frequencies of MERS-CoV-reactive CD8 + Tc1-type T cells were observed in a large proportion of patients with severe and moderate illness at the acute stage prior to the detection of humoral and CD4 + T-cell responses. At the convalescent phase, the magnitude of the CD8 + T-cell response was not greatly augmented further, and actually contracted in some cases. On the basis of these data, we can infer that inefficient control of invading MERS-CoV brings about robust inflammatory and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, which clear the invading virions and also destroy lung tissue yielding to pneumonia.",

Our observation reinforces this association. Thus, the elevated serum levels of IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1, which are associated with inflammatory process and recruitment of inflammatory cells, could reflect the ongoing inflammation at the infection site. In our study, 2 deceased patients who did not show any detectable T-cell responses had a very high level of plasma proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines at their acute phase of infection. Therefore, it is highly probable that the inflammatory reaction would damage diseased lung tissue in the absence of CTL responses in these 2 patients. Interestingly, the plasma level of RANTES was detected to be increased at the convalescent phase of infection irrespective of disease severity. We speculate that this late increase of RANTES might be associated with the secretion of this chemokine by activated virus-reactive T lymphocytes [23] .",

Examination of infected mice transiently expressing the human DPP-4 receptor revealed that T-cell responses are required for viral clearance [12] . Interestingly, Coleman et al reported that, using a mouse model in which hDPP4 is expressed under the endogenous mDPP4 promoter, CD8 + T cells may contribute to MERS-CoV-induced lung pathology [24] . The potential pathogenic contribution of strong CTL responses at the acute phase of infection has also been demonstrated in animal influenza virus infection [25] . Our data also suggest the pathogenic role of CD8 + T cells in human MERS-CoV infection. We posit 2 pathways for inducing a strong CD8 + T-cell response at the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection. Antigenic stimulation caused by inefficient removal of invading virus and/or a large inoculum of virus could induce a rapid proliferation and differentiation of naive CD8 + T cells in the absence of CD4 + T cells [26] . Otherwise, it could be due to heterologous immunity: memory CD8 + T cells-activated by prior infection with unrelated viruses-cross-reacting with MERS-CoV antigens [27] . Further studies will be needed to address these possibilities.",

            "text": "Moreover, the magnitude of the innate immune response-represented by the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines-and humoral immune response was revealed to increase proportionally with the disease severity in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [29] . Our study further demonstrates that, similar to B-cell responses, T-cell responses against MERS-CoV infection are also elevated in severe/moderate cases compared with mild infections. While there is a lack of data on the kinetics of T-cell responses during SARS-CoV infection, numerous studies have investigated the memory T-cell responses in recovered SARS-CoV patients [15, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Among them, a comprehensive study of T-cell responses against all the SARS-CoV proteins showed the dominance of CD8 + T-cell responses over CD4 + T cells [15] , which is in line with our findings in MERS-CoV, though the observations were made at different time points. However, the major protein recognized by CD4 + T cells seems to be different between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. While CD4 + T-cell responses in SARS-CoV were clustered mainly in the spike protein [15] , CD4 + T cells in patients with MERS-CoV responded slightly more to E/M/N rather than S protein. This difference is not likely due to the different time points at which CD4 + T-cell responses were analyzed because the same recognition pattern of memory CD4 + T cells was observed in MERS-CoV patients at 1 year postinfection (unpublished data).",

The same correlations were also observed at the early convalescent phase of the infection in our study. However, there is a different interpretation regarding CD8 + T-cell responses. Based on the finding that patients with mild or subclinical illness develop prominent virus-specific CD8 + T-cell responses, Zhao et al proposed that measurements of MERS-CoV-specific T-cell responses may be useful for making prognoses [9] . Our study, which used acute stage samples, suggests a poor prognosis if a virus-specific CD8 + T-cell response is detected at the acute phase of infection. Nevertheless, as the presence of virus-specific CD8 + T cells at the acute phase of infection was not shown in some patients with severe and moderate illness, it is not a reliable biomarker for poor outcomes.",

All of the patients were believed to have been exposed to MERS-CoV antigens for the first time in their lives. Thus, we assumed that the anti-MERS-CoV immune responses measured in this study would be a primary immune response. Moreover, the time course of antigen exposure and symptom onset was relatively well defined in these patients due to a sudden outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea. The limited number of patients recruited in this study, however, was an obstacle to reaching a conclusion. Another weakness of our study is the absence of viral load data. Consequently, we could not define the relationship between antigen dose and the magnitude of the cellular immune response. Nevertheless, our study provides valuable information about the cellular immune response against MERS-CoV infection in humans at the early period of infection.",
