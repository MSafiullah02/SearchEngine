Concerning children infected with RVA, NoV, HBoV and HAdV, no statistically significant differences were observed in the medians of viral loads in feces when comparing HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative children. Comparing viral loads of distinct enteric viruses in HIV-1 seronegative patients, it was observed that RVA presented the higher median (5.81 [IQR = 5.53\u20136.62] log10 copies/g). In this group, median viral load in feces for NoV, HAstV, HBoV and HAdV reached 2.72 (IQR = 0.69\u20133.51), 1.29 (IQR = 1.17\u20134.99), 4.72 (IQR = 3.07\u20134.72), and 3.23 (IQR = 2.27\u20133.90) log10 copies/g, respectively. RVA also presented the higher median viral load among HIV-1 seropositive children: 6.08 (IQR = 3.36\u20137.17) log10 copies/g.

In the present study, the opportunistic character of NoV may be evidenced by the fact that, among HIV-1 seropositive children, its positivity rate was more than 3 times higher among patients with CD4 T lymphocyte counts <200 cells/mm3. Despite viral loads being higher among HIV-1 seropositive children, and particularly among those more severely immunocompromised, differences were not statistically significant.

The high genetic diversity of NoV has been described among HIV-1 seronegative individuals [51]. Our data reaffirm that NoV is an important agent of DD in HIV-1 seropositive children in Brazil. NoV has been associated with DD in HIV positive patients, and in some studies it has been detected more frequently in this group, as demonstrated in Tanzania [52]. The importance of NoV as a cause of hospitalization and DD-associated death in HIV-1 seropositive children was also demonstrated in South Africa [53]. In Venezuela it was observed that NoV excretion is significantly more frequent in HIV-1 seropositive children, regardless of whether or not they are suffering from DD [34]. Frequent NoV infection in HIV-1 seropositive children with and without DD has also been reported in Kenya in a study that points to the high genetic diversity of NoV in HIV-1 seropositive children [54].",

Interestingly, among HIV-1 seropositive children HBoV, like NoV, was significantly more frequent in the group with CD4 T lymphocyte counts <200 cells/mm3.HBoV is an emerging pathogen, considered as a potential DD agent. Its clinical and epidemiological importance as a DD agent has not yet been fully clarified. HBoV has been identified in respiratory secretion of HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative patients with acute respiratory infections [55, 56] and in the feces of HIV-1 seropositive patients in Brazil [35, 57]. Additional studies should be performed to more accurately characterize the role of HBoV as an opportunistic agent in immunocompromised children.",

Studies from Brazil report HAdV excretion by HIV-1 seropositive children with and without DD [58]. HAdV is a common cause of pediatric DD, also causing respiratory infections. In immunocompromised patients, other infections, especially CMV, may coexist with HAdV. HAdV associated colitis is a clinical entity characterized by persistent diarrhea described in HIV-1 seropositive patients in the pre-HAART era [26, 27, 59]. For the first time in Brazil, we are reporting enteric HAdV in HIV-1 seropositive patients. In this study, the enteric HAdV type F-40 was detected in almost one-half of HAdV-1 positive fecal samples. However, a great diversity of types was observed, some not commonly associated with DD. Similar viral loads of enteric and non-enteric HAdV were observed, suggesting comparable replication intensity in the digestive tract. Among HIV-1 seropositive children, HAdV was detected with similar frequency and viral load among patients with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts bellow and above <200 cells/mm3.",

RVA is actually a significantly more common pathogen in children with DD hospitalized in a general pediatric hospital with no underlying diseases or complex co-morbidities such as AIDS, as demonstrated in Tanzania [33]. Nevertheless, RVA is also detected in HIV-positive children, particularly among those younger than 24 months. RVA genotype distribution was similar, with predominance of G1P[8] and G9P[8] both in HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 seronegative children. RVA is a common cause of DD in pediatric patients, worldwide. In the last decade, its detection rate in children with DD has been reduced due to vaccination with monovalent and pentavalent vaccines in countries such as Brazil, where universal vaccination with the monovalent vaccine has been implemented in 2006 [6]. Therefore, in this study, children recruited until 2006 were not vaccinated with the monovalent rotavirus vaccine. The monovalent rotavirus vaccine is not indicated for immunocompromised HIV-1 seropositive children (CD4+ T lymphocyte counts <200 cells/mm3). From 2006 to 2010, vaccine coverage ranged from 70% a 90% in Rio de Janeiro, for the cohort of children born after March 2006.",
