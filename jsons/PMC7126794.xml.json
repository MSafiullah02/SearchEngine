Studies aimed at the functional role of APN revealed that this enzyme is involved in different processes such as hydrolysis of nutrients, inactivation of bioactive peptides, binding of corona viruses, mediating CMV infection, regulation of tumour-cell invasion, and degradation of the extracellular matrix and antigen presentation 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.",

The inhibition of newly transcribed messenger RNA by actinomycin D leads to a continued decrease of mRNA species, the time course of which is depended on their rates of decay. The reduction of APN RNA level is measured as the time-dependent decrease of the ratio between the APN wild-type and the APN standard fragment in RT-PCR. Fig. 1\nA represents three independent quantification experiments using resting T-cells from one donor. Summarizing the data obtained with resting T-cells from six healthy donors, the half-life time of APN transcript in resting T-cells was determined to be approximately 3.5 h (Fig. 2\n). The apparent half-life of APN transcript in resting NK cells was estimated as about 6 hours, however, NK-cell data showed more variance than those of T-cells (Table 1\n).

            "text": "During the last years it has been shown that within the hematopoietic system CD13 expression is not restricted to myelomonocytic cells. It has been longly known that this antigen is frequently expressed on lymphoid tumour clones. The frequencies of such CD13-positive clones vary between 5 and 30% 13, 21. Recently, it has been proven that other immune cells such as resting lymphocytes and NK cells express membrane-bound APN as well. In contrast to myelomonocytic cells, these cells express low amounts of APN; however, their CD13 surface expression is increased by different mitogenic stimuli or after co-cultivation with synoviocytes or other CD13-expressing cells 16, 22, 23, 24. The functional relevance of this induction is unclear as yet, but it has been proposed that APN like other membrane-bound peptidases such as neutral endopeptidase (E.C. 3.4.24.11, CD10), aminopeptidase A (E.C. 3.4.11.7) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (E.C. 3.4.15.1, CD143) may function as a regulatory molecule that degrades bioactive peptides [5]. The induction of CD13 on T-cells is generally accompanied by an increase of the corresponding enzymatic activity and APN mRNA level 16, 24. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the CD13 induction on T-lymphocytes, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the APN gene. Actinomycin D inhibits nearly all RNA synthesis by intercalation into DNA. Furthermore, it also prevents the binding of ribosomes to transcripts and, therefore, subsequent protein synthesis [25]. Using this approach, the half-lives of the APN transcript were determined in different immune cells. The average half-life span of human transcripts is about 10 h, ranging from less than 15 min to more than 24 h [26]. Talking into account these data, the APN half-lives of 3.5\u20136 h could be considered as medium. Since no data on APN half-life time in any tissue are available, the data obtained in this study can only be compared to those of other glycoproteins. Comparable half-life times were described for annexin VII (3\u20136 h), lactoferrin (8\u20139 h) and myeloperoxidase (4\u20135 h) 27, 28.",

Both promoter regions considerably differ with respect to transcription factor-binding sites. The transcription factors LF-B1 and Sp-1 represent the major regulators in epithelial and liver cells, whereas myb and Ets-2 both transactivate CD13 expression in myeloid cells 29, 31. The importance of promoter-mediated regulation is emphasised by reports showing that modulation of APN surface expression on endometrial cells and leukaemic B-cells is directly linked to the activity of the tissue-specific APN gene promoter 32, 33.",

RNA synthesis inhibition leads to a linear decrease of steady-state APN mRNA levels with half-life times of 3.5\u20136 h in different hematopoietic cells. Therefore, it could be assumed that factors involved in APN mRNA degradation seem to be more stable than transcription factors which control the constitutive APN gene expression in resting T-cells. The activation-dependent induction of APN gene expression in T-cells may be due to the action of new transcription factors, an assumption which is supported by the increase of APN-promoter activity detected in stimulated T-cells. Shapiro and co-workers identified putative Sp-1, PU- AP-2, myb- and ETF-binding sites in the alternative promoter which probably contributes to the transcriptional activation of the APN gene [30]. However, the prolonged half-life time of APN-transcript in stimulated T-cells as well as the discrepancy between the 2.7-fold increase of APN transcript level and the 1.7-fold rise of transcription rate in these cells suggest the appearance or disappearance of factors directly involved in the degradation of APN transcript. Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA decay after stimulation is a common regulatory mechanism described for other transcripts such as the CD11a, the mMCP-2 (chymase-homolog protein) 34, 35.",
