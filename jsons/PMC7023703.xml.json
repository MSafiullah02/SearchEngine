Each of these plays an important role in viral maintenance. The risk associated with transfusion used to be major but it decreased sharply with the introduction of strict regulatory policies regarding blood screening in Brazil and elsewhere [39\u201341].

Among the Guaymi in Panama, there are relatively more infected children born from infected mothers [28, 45], and among the Kubenkokre, Kayapo villagers in the Amazon region of Brazil, familial cluster studies have showed the transmission of the virus crossing one or more generations, and more than 20% of the children under 9 years of age are infected [6].

In the Amazon region of Brazil, injecting drugs was not an important route for the spread and maintenance of HTLV-1/2 in urban, nonurban, or isolated communities or in co-infection with HIV-1 [50, 51] in a clear contrast to what was usually seen in other areas of Brazil, where the use of illicit drugs is a well-known risk factor for both virus infections [52\u201354].

South American countries reported quite different figures with large variations, including in Argentina (0.07%), Chile (0.73%), Venezuela (6.8%), Colombia, where the prevalence was higher in low geographical areas (4.3%) than in higher areas (0.73%) of the country, and in French Guiana (6.7\u201313.1%) [107\u2013110]. It is important to bear in mind that these figures are rarely comparable as there are no uniformity of the different population groups investigated (age, sex, sampling, laboratory assays, among others). It is relevant to mention that the same variables are the cause to find such conflicting figures also described in Brazil where the mean prevalence was initially thought to be approximately 0.41%, but there was a large range of prevalence rates from 0.08% in Manaus and Florianopolis to 1.35% in Salvador [98]. It was common to use serological assays prepared with different strains of HTLV and different targets of the reagents to detect the antibodies, and this technique is one of the possible reasons for such a variation in the figures found.",

The state of Acre is an endemic area for malaria, an additional variable that might add confusion because of the misinterpretation of results owing to cross-reactions against HTLV-1 detected in patients infected with Plasmodium sp. [111]. Even though, a prevalence of 0.73% was detected among the general population of Cruzeiro do Sul, where malaria is endemic. There was a strong expectation of high prevalence rates in the State of Acre considering the Indians racial mixture of the general population, but so far, there is no evidence of wide distributions of the two viruses.",

The initial figures indicated that the prevalence rates measured by immunoenzymatic assays ranged from 3.6% to more than 30% for HTLV-1, mostly among Indians populations [84, 85], that the rate was 0.91% among those undergoing blood donation screening [100]. A large distribution of HTLV-2 was shown among Indians communities not only in the State of Para but also in the Amazon area of Brazil, reaching confirmed prevalence rates of more than 40% [6, 51, 56, 63] among some Indian communities and the detection of a new molecular subtype (HTLV-2c) that was soon also described in urban areas outside of the ARB [6, 33, 50, 51, 116]. Prevalence studies also provide interesting information, such as the description of HTLV-2b among blood donors in Bel\u00e9m, which stresses the need for ongoing molecular epidemiology investigations [116]. A comprehensive investigation detected HTLV-1 among 0.3% (n = 39) of 13,382 pregnant women in Bel\u00e9m and one person infected with HTLV-2 [103]. Later, another prevalence rate of 0.61% was detected in pregnant women in Bel\u00e9m [106]. A prevalence rate (4.7%) of antibodies against HTLV, detected by enzyme immune assay, was described among residents along the shores of the Tucurui hydroelectric power plant [117]. This was a rather high figure for urban communities, however there was no confirmation of reactivity by other laboratory methods. The most recent investigation in Bel\u00e9m considered the prevalence of antibodies against HTLV among 1059 inhabitants and showed a 2% positivity for antibodies against both HTLV-1 (n = 15) and HTLV-2 (n = 5) [118].",

The selection of blood donors, the selection of diseased population subgroups, and the retrospective collection of data are some of the examples that should be avoided in future prevalence studies. Relevant population groups should be selected and preferably using multiple centers of study working together to increase sample size. It is relevant to stress that confirmatory tests should be always used to make sure the information is not equivocal and the absence of correct information should be put ahead to avoid misinterpretations. Urban populations should be the optimal target to answer important questions such as the following: who is mostly affected by this neglected infection? Who should receive future preventive measures such as vaccines? Which risk factors are relevant for the transmission of the virus?",

New and authoritative epidemiological information should be gathered to gauge the actual need for such a product. Australian aboriginal people are examples of persons at high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with the wide dissemination and high prevalence of HTLV-1. Respiratory diseases recently also described in the ARB [121] are new and dangerous facets of the infection that can truncate productive lives, which is a compelling reason to revitalize HTLV-1 epidemiological studies in the ARB, elsewhere in the country and worldwide.",
