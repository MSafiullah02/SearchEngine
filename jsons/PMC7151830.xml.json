            "text": "Mucosal infections are caused by emerging pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, which are mucosally transmitted and replicate in the mucosal tissues. These pathogens enter the human through single or multiple mucosal sites such as oral, nasal, conjunctival, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, invade the bloodstream, and finally lead to infection. Approximately 68% of deaths in children younger than 5 years are due to mucosal infections.1 Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae,2\nStaphylococcus aureus,3\nanaerobic bacteria,4\nStreptococcus viridans,5 \u03b1-Streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and viruses such as Haemophilus influenzae, Corona virus, and human adenovirus6 cause mucosal infections. The mucosal infections are treated by antibiotics, and vaccines are administered through oral, parenteral, and nasal routes. A nasal vaccine induces mucosal immune responses and systemic immunity, which provides better protection against infectious agents. Yet developing vaccine delivery systems that induce humoral and cell-mediated response with mucosal immunity has been challenging to date. Different mucosal routes are being explored using different delivery systems, and the nasal route is preferred as compared to other mucosal routes.",

            "text": "The mucosal route of vaccine delivery is one of the better alternatives to conventional multiple injection vaccines, which employ traumatic procedures and may also lead to the spread of infectious agents via contaminated syringes. Mucosal vaccine development has grown extensively, and a multitude of vaccine delivery systems have been developed for application via ocular, nasal, oral, rectal, and vaginal routes. Of all the different routes of mucosal vaccination, the oral and nasal routes are most accepted and easily accessible. For many decades, intranasal applications of tobacco snuff, cocaine, and various hallucinogenic and psychotropic agents have been in practice.7 Similarly, for many years synthetic drugs have been administered intranasally for their local effect on the mucosa (eg, antihistamines, antibiotics, and nonpeptide drugs).8 The first nasal influenza vaccine was introduced in 2001, but it was later withdrawn from the market due to potential toxicity problems. Another intranasal vaccine (Flumist) was launched in 2003 and was administered using a syringe sprayer. Success of a vaccine depends not only on the delivery but also on the route of administration; for example, nasal immunization elicits potent immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion in the respiratory tract.9 Nasal administrations of vaccines have been shown to achieve a better systemic bioavailability and protection from gastric enzymes compared with parenteral and oral administration. Nasal delivery of vaccines acts as a \u201cfirst entry block,\u201d that is, blocks the pathogen entry, while invading to the mucosal surface by inducing local microbial-specific immune responses, thus increasing the general efficacy of the vaccine. In addition, vaccine uptake into the blood circulatory system by absorption through mucosa can be relatively fast.10 It is the most appropriate method of immunization because it is rich in T cells, B cells, and plasma cells and stimulates both antigen-specific systemic and mucosal adaptive immune responses. It provides better patient compliance due to the needle-free delivery.",

The atrium is placed in an intermediate region between the vestibule and the respiratory region. The respiratory region, the nasal turbinates, occupies more area of the nasal cavity. It possesses lateral walls that divide it into three sections composed of the superior nasal turbinate (superior region), nasal turbinate (middle region), and inferior turbinate (inferior region).

NALT is in the Waldeyer\u2019s ring, which includes the pharynx and tonsils. The inductive site for nasal immunity is NALT, M cells, B cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and regional and cervical lymph nodes. Nasally immunized vaccine is transported to NALT through the FAE that contains specialized villous M cells for process and presentation. Villous M cells lack a brush border, which facilitates the binding and delivery of antigens and also does not secrete mucus or any enzymes. NALT is involved in the induction of DC, B cell, and T cell responses following nasal vaccination and also produces local defense against invading pathogens. Part of the soluble antigens may migrate to regional draining lymph nodes through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to Th cells. Activation of antigen-specific CD4+ T helper cells (Th cells) interacts with B cells, which develop into IgA committed (IgA+). The IgA+ B cells rapidly migrate from the NALT to the draining cervical lymph nodes in the nasal passage where they differentiate into IgA-producing plasma in the presence of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-6 that are produced by Th2 cells and secrete IgA in dimers. Dimeric IgA then becomes S-IgA by binding to the polymeric Ig receptor, which transports IgA to effector sites. S-IgA is able to bind toxins, bacteria, or viruses and neutralize their activity, thus preventing entry into the body or reaching the internal organs, and forms a first barrier of defense against invading antigens. Intranasally administered vaccines elicit neutralizing IgA, preventing colonization of the throat and systemic IgG antibodies and facilitating clearance from systemic sites (Fig. 15.3\n). Immune-competent cells in tonsillar lymphoid tissue and ciliated and nonciliated cells also play a role in immunity generation. The production of IgA by both the adenoid tissue and the nasal mucosa contributes significantly to immune protection against inhaled bacteria and viruses.37\n",

Liposomes are a promising delivery system because of their size, ampiphilic nature, and biocompatibility. These vesicles form spontaneously when an aqueous solution is added to a dried film of the lipid components. The hydrophilic (water-soluble or polar head) portion of the lipid molecule is present toward the aqueous phase, and the hydrophobic (water-insoluble) portion is allied inside the membrane. Many of the phospholipids used to make liposomes are from food products (eg, egg yolk or soybeans),46 so they are nontoxic and safe. The potency of liposomes depends on different factors such as the surface of the lipid layers, electric charge, composition, and method of preparation.47 Liposomes can also act as an adjuvant,48 which leads to the induction of potential immune response with low antigen payload. They can also convert nonimmunogenic substances into immunogenic forms (eg, by rendering soluble substances particulate in nature). Liposomes are taken up by macrophages and by M cells for antigen processing and/or presentation to other lymphoid cells for the induction of immune responses. They can also directly present antigens to lymphoid cells for the induction of immune responses. Nasal application of liposomes containing bacterial polysaccharide antigens has been tested in BALB/c mice and revealed that enhanced immune responses in pulmonary secretions was observed in mice after immunization of the liposomal antigen in comparison with antigen alone and as an oral immunization.49 Apart from this, many investigations carried out on liposomes using different antigens are described in Table 15.1\n. A nasal influenza vaccine, based on a liposome (virosomal) formulation of influenza virus subunits, has recently been marketed in Europe by the Swiss Serum Institute (Berne, Switzerland).

In 1984 Morein and colleagues showed the potential induction of immune responses upon immunization with ISCOMs containing viral and bacterial membrane glycoproteins. ISCOMs are the potent inducers of not only humoral (antibody-mediated) immune responses but also cellular (T cell-mediated) immune responses. Presentation of antigens unified with the ISCOM matrix allows their processing via the endogenous and exogenous pathways, resulting in the stimulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.86 Moreover, adjuvant activity of the Quil A moiety induces long-lasting immune responses. The antibody levels stimulated by ISCOMs are found to be equivalent to those after immunization with conventional adjuvants such as complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant or alum.87 Some studies revealed that immunization with ISCOMs induces a wide range of immune responses including all subclasses of IgG and cell-mediated immune responses such as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in vivo, antigen-specific proliferative responses and cytokine production in vitro.88., 89., 90. An additional property of ISCOMs is their capability to enter the endogenous antigen-processing pathway and then MHC class I\u2013restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL). Intranasal immunization of Echinococcus granulosus surface antigen ISCOMs evokes higher serum IgA titer in relation to IgG than the subcutaneous route in mice.91 Several studies on different antigens using ISCOM-based delivery systems are shown in Table 15.1. Hence ISCOM-based delivery systems may be suitable for nasal vaccine administration.",

VLPs are efficiently taken up by DCs and induce potent immune responses after nasal immunization, which induces systemic immunity as well as both local and distal mucosal immunity via the common mucosal immune system (CMIS). It is even more superior to parenteral administration at eliciting IgA at distal mucosal sites. The VLPs can be produced within mammalian cells, insect cells, yeast, bacteria, and even plants through recombinant DNA techniques.94., 95. Due to these properties, VLPs are exploited as the delivery system for different protein/peptide antigens. Despite successful usage and potent immunity, VLPs as a delivery system for protein antigens are still limited by the relatively complicated genetic modification on protein fusion and the subsequently required structural integrity characterization. VLP technology has been used for many years. An examples includes recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris yeasts.96 The entire recombinant core antigen (HBcAg) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) promotes Th1 immunomodulation of the immune response to coadministered antigens, including the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) after nasal administration. This concept also applies to HIV, dengue, and chronic hepatitis C immunotheraphy; details are discussed in Table 15.1. VLPs elicit a potent immune response and increase the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic antigens, including self-proteins.",

Emulsions are of various types including oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O). Most of the novel adjuvants are made up of emulsions such as incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant, adjuvant 65, montanide, and MF59.98 Emulsions are isotropic, transparent, thermodynamically stable, and low viscosity colloidal dispersions, which are stabilized by an interfacial film of alternating surfactants and cosurfactant molecules. Ease of administration and scale-up is one of the important advantages over other drug delivery systems such as solid dispersion, liposomes, and particulate delivery systems. Emulsion formulation contains different inactive ingredients such as oil (soybean oil, sesame oil, isopropyl myristate, etc.), surfactant (Tweens, Span80, chromophores, PEG, lecithin, cetrimide, etc.), cosurfactant (ethanol, propanol, PEG, etc.), and aqueous phase. Mucoadhesive polymer such as different grades of carbopol (eg, 974P/971P/980P, sodium alginate, pluronics, etc.) is generally incorporated in the composition of an emulsion to prolong the release of antigens. Micro-/nanoemulsion provides good sprayability for nasal vaccine delivery compared with other particulate delivery systems. Factors to consider during the preparation of a formulation include nature and concentration of oil, surfactant, cosurfactant, and aqueous phase; ratio of oil/surfactant/cosurfactant; and temperature and pH of the environment. Dilutability, particle size, pH, zeta potential, viscosity, and freeze/thaw cycling are critical parameters in the development of emulsion vaccines. Nanoemulsion nasal vaccines have been studied for several diseases like hepatitis B, HIV, and influenza.99 Some studies reported that the nasal vaccine immunization produced strong IgG and IgA antibody levels, which is similar to alum adjuvant-based vaccines. The emulsion-based delivery approach might be promising for low-cost nasal vaccine immunization for the populations of developing and underdeveloped countries.",

An aerosol vaccination usually depends on the target pathogen and the sites of the inductive immunity. The aerosols are available in liquid (solution, suspension, and emulsion) and solid forms. In addition to vaccine antigens, carrier/solvent, emulsifier/surfactants, corrosion inhibitors, and propellant selection and compatability play a critical role in achieving required immunogenicity in infants. Aerosol vaccine immunogenecity achievement is based on antigen particle size for prevention of upper respiratory (eg, Boredetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumonia) and lower respiratory (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis) bacteria and virus disease. Larger particles (\u223c5 \u03bcm) are needed for the aerosol vaccination to prevent upper respiratory tract infection and smaller particles (\u2264 3 \u03bcm) for lower respiratory tract infection.111 The dried forms of vaccines with optimum particle size are traditionally prepared by freeze drying or spray drying. The aerosol form of vaccines was administered to many human subjects for a longer period and found to provide excellent protection for diseases such as influenza A and measles.112., 113.

            "text": "Nasal gels are generally used for colds, allergies, low humidity, or overuse of decongestant. Nasal vaccine gels are a high-viscosity solution or suspension in which antigenic molecules are dispersed. The advantages of a nasal gel include the reduction of nasal clearance and anterior leakage due to highly viscous formulation, reduction of irritation by using soothing/emollient excipients, and target delivery to mucosa for better absorption.114 In addition, it may potentially enhance the immune response, reduce the antigen and/or adjuvant dose, sustain antigen release, and improve antigen uptake with enhanced antigen stability. Special application techniques are required for the administration of nasal gel vaccines because of their highly viscous formulation and poor spreading abilities. A wide variety of gelling polymers are available for formulation such as pullulan, deaceylated gellan gum, xantham gum, chitosan, and polyethylene glycol, used to encapsulate vaccine/adjuvant formulation as gel particles. Viscosity, sol-gel transition temperature and gelling time, and gel strength and its texture are critical parameters in the development of nasal gel vaccines. Recently, pneumococcal surface protein-A nasal gel vaccine,115\nClostridium botulinum type-A neurotoxin BoHc/A, and tetanus toxoid116 were studied in animal models and enhanced both humoral and cellular immunity. Nasal gel is an alternative and promising novel dosage delivery system to achieve the immune response.",

It avoids the risk of transmitting diseases like hepatitis B, HIV, and other agents through improper injection practices and improves patient compliance. The intranasal vaccine delivery system induces both mucosal and systemic immune response, which avoids entry of pathogen in all mucosal routes. Multiple delivery systems are being explored (both developmental and clinical phases) and can open the door for practical development of nasal vaccine delivery systems.",
