Effective clinical management, based on comprehensive laboratory findings, is critical for improving the survival rates of COVID-19 patients. By now, clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in cities outside of Wuhan, such as Beijing1 and Wenzhou2 are described. However, it is currently unknown whether there are any markers that can be informative of mild vs. severe disease. The objective of this study is to describe the comprehensive clinical characteristics of confirmed patients with COVID-19 and explore the potential markers correlating with prognosis.",

The severe cases in this study refer to the patients who had enrolled to the intensive care unit (ICU) and received a treatment for more than 3 days, whereas the other confirmed cases were distributed to the mild group. As a control, we collected the laboratory results of 20 healthy subjects (normal cases) examined by the same laboratory department during early December 2019, when COVID-19 was not yet prevalent in Xiangyang. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and disease outcome data were obtained from data collection forms and electronic medical records. Information was collected on the date of illness onset, visits to clinical facilities, and hospital admissions. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was first noticed. Laboratory tests were conducted at admission, including a complete blood count and serum biochemistry.",

While some studies for clinical examinations have been published, many were not comprehensive and the studies took place in Wuhan.3, 4, 5, 6 Especially in the early stages of the outbreak, due to the overwhelmed medical system and lack of adequate medical resources and staff in Wuhan, clinical studies and laboratory examination results may not be reflective of the true nature of COVID-19 in patients. Indeed, this is reflected in the case fatality rates inside (4%) and outside of Wuhan (2.5%, according to our study). While other studies suggest that men are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were no significant differences in susceptibility to the virus between men and women in our study, even though women had more mild disease cases. The results in this study support the suggestion that there are no significant differences in the levels of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) expression between genders. As ACE2 is more highly expressed in elderly people, they theoretically would account for a higher percentage of the COVID-19 patients in this study.",
