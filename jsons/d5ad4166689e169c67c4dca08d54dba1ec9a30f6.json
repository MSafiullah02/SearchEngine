If available, residual whole blood samples from serial collections, with or without 65 paired NP samples, were also included in the analysis. A volume of 400\u00b5L of EDTA plasma from 66 the residual whole blood was extracted and processed to assess for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Testing 67 was performed based on the adaptation of published rRT-PCR assays targeting the envelope (E) 68 gene. 3-5 The standard cycle threshold (Ct) values of positive tests with this assay range from <20 69 to 45 cycles.

            "text": ", direct comparison of these results is challenging due to the use of different 120 testing protocols, including differences in specimen extraction volumes (ranging from 80 to 121 200\uf06dL), sample types examined (plasma, serum and whole blood), viral genomic targets tested (N, 122 S, E or ORF1ab genes), variable timing of blood collection relative to symptom chronology and 123 different patient populations. For example, using the most similar plasma RT-PCR method to this 124 study as a comparator, the higher prevalence of RNAemia may be explained by the higher 125 proportion of individuals with severe disease in this cohort (ICU transfer 20.0% vs 11.1%). 8 By 126 comparison, clinical illness with SARS-CoV-1 was almost always severe, and RNAemia was be considered as a complementary modality for the early identification of individuals is limited by its single-center experience, and use of a convenience set of samples for 143 SARS-CoV-2 testing that favored overall selection of individuals with more severe disease given 144 the need for having had a blood sample collection. However, that a signal for ICU transfer was145 detected despite this patient selection lends further support to the clinical importance of RNAemia. 146 Furthermore, individuals in this cohort rapidly required ICU transfer from their time of arrival to 147 the hospital, such that plasma samples collected a single day before or on the same day as ICU 148 transfer reflect real-world experience. In addition, in the absence of viral culture data, it cannot be 149 determined at present whether detectable RNA represents intact infectious virus or inactive, non-150 replicating nucleic acid. A recent study attempted to address this question but failed to detect 151 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in all serum samples such that culture could not be pursued. 9 Further work 152 should thus be performed to investigate this question given the potential important biosafety and 153 blood product transfusion implications, though non-severely ill individuals are less likely to be",
