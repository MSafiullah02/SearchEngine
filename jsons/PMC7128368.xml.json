The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in parts of west Africa has reinforced the need for strong public health leadership, organisation, and better preparedness to rise up to new health challenges. Having been accused of slow response in the face of Ebola crisis,1 WHO moved quickly to declare Zika virus a public health emergency. Most African countries need to fortify their health security because they are affected by both disasters and diseases, which pose a major threat to the infrastrucure.2 Although Nigeria was successful in its effort to control the spread of Ebola virus, the country is still facing numerous public health challenges and needs to strengthen local health security.",

Additionally, three cases of wild polio were recently reported by government in Borno State.4 Five cases of Lassa fever have also been reported within a short space of time in Bauchi, Gombe, Plateau, and River States. Therefore, there is a need for governments to protect people against these threats through strong public health infrastructures and health-care systems.",

Nigeria can only respond effectively to disaster and contain disease outbreaks if the health system is viable;6 besides, functioning health-care systems are the bedrock of health security.7 Nigerian government should not wait for the participation of international health leaders before preventing, detecting, and responding to health crises. It behoves of government to secure the health of the people and provide a safer future for them.",
