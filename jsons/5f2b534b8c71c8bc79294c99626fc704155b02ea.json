In addition, surveys based on large, nationally representative samples of Americans (N = 118,026) show that people earning higher incomes spend less time with their families and neighbours and more time with their friends (11).",

However, such arguments are yet to be substantiated by the existing Covid-19 evidence. (25) reveals the relationship between race and Covid-19 infection/mortality. Based on the US Covid-19 Map and Census data, the Washington Post shows how infection and mortality cases are unequally distributed among different racial groups, with more blacks and Hispanics suffering from Covid-19, in some parts of the country. Up till now, no rigorous scientific study has been done to investigate the role of SES in Covid-19 infection and mortality across the US, at the fine-grained spatial resolution. To fill this research gap, we propose to examine the relationship between SES and Covid-19 infection/morality at the state/county-level in the US, while accounting for other important factors such as lockdown/social distancing, co-morbidities, and COVID-19 infection testing capacities.",
