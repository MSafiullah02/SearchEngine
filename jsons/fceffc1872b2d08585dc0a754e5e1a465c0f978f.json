            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children worldwide and can cause high mortality, especially in developing countries. However, information on the clinical and molecular characteristics of RSV infection in developing countries is limited. From April 2010 to May 2011, 1,082 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with ARI admitted to the Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Samples were screened for RSV and genotyped by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Demographic and clinical data was also recorded. RSV was found in 23.8% (257/1,082) of samples. RSV A was the dominant subgroup, accounting for 91.4% (235/257), followed by RSV B, 5.1% (13/257), and 9 cases (3.5%) were mixed infection of these subgroups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all group A strains belonged to the GA2 genotype. All group B strains belonged to the recently identified BA genotype, and further clustered into 2 recently described subgenotypes BA9 and BA10. One GA2 genotype strain had a premature stop codon which shortened the G protein length. RSV infection was significantly associated with younger age and higher severity score than those without. Co-infection with other viruses did not affect disease severity. RSV A caused more severe disease than RSV B. The results from this study will not only contribute to the growing database on the molecular diversity of RSV circulating worldwide but may be also useful in clinical management and vaccine development.

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among infants and young children worldwide [1] . The clinical presentations can vary from mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) to life threatening bronchiolitis and pneumonia which result in significant pediatric hospitalization and economic burden [2] . Primary RSV infections occur during the first year of life in more than 50% of infants, and by 2 years of age, almost all children have been infected at least once [3] . RSV can cause re-infections throughout life with milder disease, indicating that either RSV infection induces an inadequate immune response or genetic variability of RSV is extensive [4] . RSV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. RSV is divided into two major groups, A and B, initially based on the reaction of the virus with monoclonal antibodies against the major structural glycoproteins G and F [5] and later by genetic analysis [6] . Each group can be further subdivided into genotypes by nucleotide sequence variability. The attachment glycoprotein G is the most divergent viral protein, both between and within the two groups, and a major target for neutralizing and protective antibody responses [7] .",

So far, RSV group A is divided into 8 genotypes (GA1 to GA7, and SAA1), and so is RSV group B (GB1 to GB4, SAB1 to SAB3, and BA) [9] . BA, which was first isolated in Buenos Aires in 1999, is a new genotype of group B with a 60-nucleotide duplication in the second variable region of the G protein gene [10] . The two groups circulate independently, but often at the same time, although group A viruses tend to predominate [3, 11] . The presence of two groups has led to the speculation that there might be a relationship between the RSV-group infections and clinical severity. A number of studies were carried out but such a relationship has not been fully elucidated [12] .",

The molecular characteristics of RSV were determined for the first time in Vietnam, and carried characteristics both similar to strains from other parts of the world and specific to Vietnam. Subgroup A and B of RSV were co-circulating and subgroup A caused more severe disease than subgroup B. Similar surveillance should be continued to follow the epidemiology of this virus. A better understanding of RSV epidemiology is essential to enable prediction of outbreaks and for planning preventive and therapeutic control measures.",
