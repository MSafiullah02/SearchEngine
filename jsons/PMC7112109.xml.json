            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) belong to the family Coronaviridae (Enjuanes, 2000). PEDV and TGEV have been classified into the alphacoronavirus genus, whereas PDCoV belongs to the deltacoronavirus genus (Jung et al., 2016a; Jung and Saif, 2015a). They share similar genome architectures, with a 25\u201330 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the viral genome encodes non-structural proteins from open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b necessary for viral genome replication. The rest of the genome encodes a number of unique accessory proteins such as PEDV ORF3, TGEV 3a/3b/7, PDCoV NS6/NS7, and four common structural proteins, namely the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Kocherhans et al., 2001; Lee and Lee, 2014; Penzes et al., 2001). These enteric swine coronaviruses (CoVs) infect epithelial cells lining the small intestine and cause villous atrophy, resulting in malabsorption and severe diarrhea (Jung et al., 2016a). An outbreak of these viruses, especially PEDV, can lead to up-to-100% mortality in neonatal piglets, prompting huge economic losses in the swine production industry worldwide. Unless they are examined by laboratory-level diagnosis, these CoVs produce almost indistinguishable pathogenesis.",

In PDCoV-positive samples, the rate of PEDV co-infection as detected by RT-PCR varies from 33% to 50% (Jung et al., 2016a; Jung and Saif, 2015a). Although TGEV infection has become rarer nowadays, it has still been detectable in samples in China, and often together with PEDV and/or PDCoV (Dong et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2013). Despite substantial epidemiological evidence of co-infection, the effects of these events on disease outcomes have not yet been formally described. Since these enteric swine CoVs share cell tropism, co-infection of these viruses can theoretically cause mixing of viral components in the same cellular compartments, possibly leading to direct or indirect effects on viral replication kinetics or pathogenic outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no reports on studies at molecular or cellular levels on how viral components from different CoV species interact with or affect other viruses. Investigation of possible molecular interactions between components of PEDV, PDCoV and TGEV and their influence on replication of each virus would provide a crucial insight into comprehensive understanding of these CoVs.",

The CoV N protein is functionally conserved across the family Coronaviridae (Chang et al., 2009; Cong et al., 2017), with its primary function being to form a scaffold for packaging viral genomic RNA (gRNA) into the internal core of virions (de Haan and Rottier, 2005). Besides scaffolding, other functions of the CoV N protein (primarily based on studies of common representatives of the family like severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)) include acting as RNA chaperones (Zuniga et al., 2007, 2010), promoting viral genome transcription or replication (Hurst et al., 2010, 2013; Masters et al., 1994; Zuniga et al., 2007, 2010), facilitating viral assembly (de Haan and Rottier, 2005; Kuo et al., 2016), suppressing antiviral RNA-interference activity from their hosts (Cui et al., 2015), and suppressing host immunity (Ding et al., 2014, 2017; Xu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018).",

NTD binds RNA through electrostatic interaction with its charged amino acids as well as interaction between conserved aromatic residues in the proteins and nucleotide bases in the RNA (Chang et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2006). LKR is a disordered domain between NTD and CTD. Studies of SARS-CoV N indicate roles for LKR in RNA binding, virion assembly and self-association (Chang et al., 2009, 2013; He et al., 2004a). Although it is also reported to have RNA binding capacity, CTD is a more hydrophobic domain mainly responsible for self-association to form stable dimers and subsequent oligomers of CoV N (Chen et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2006). Studies of N proteins from SARS-CoV and MHV revealed that N dimerization followed by multimerization is a common process in the formation of viral ribonucleoprotein that initiates viral genome packaging in the virion assembly process among CoVs (Cong et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Examples from other viruses suggest that cross-association between viral nucleocapsid proteins could determine different outcomes during co-infection. For instance, mixed infection between two types of plant tospoviruses results in interspecies interaction between their N proteins and more severe symptoms compared to single infections, suggesting synergy between these viruses (Bag et al., 2012; Tripathi et al., 2015). On the other hand, intertypic interference between types A and B influenza viruses could be partially explained by the inhibitory effect of type B influenza virus nucleoprotein exerted on its type A counterpart (Aoki et al., 1984; Jaru-ampornpan et al., 2014). Given structural similarities, we expect that CoV N proteins would likely cross-interact with each other during a co-infection event. Whether this cross-interaction has beneficial or detrimental effects on viral replication has never been explored. Investigation of the interaction between CoV N proteins could lead to insights into virus evolution, anti-CoV drug development and vaccine design (Chang et al., 2016; Lo et al., 2013).",

To explore the possibility that swine CoV N proteins might affect replication of other co-infecting CoVs, we first investigated cross-species interaction between these N proteins. Specifically, we asked if N proteins from TGEV or PDCoV can interact with PEDV N and possibly affect PEDV replication. We first assessed interspecies protein-protein interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS-PEDV N-Myc and pCAGGS expressing HA-PEDV N, PDCoV N-HA or TGEV N-FLAG. At 48 hpt, lysates were prepared and incubated with agarose beads coupled to anti-Myc antibodies prior to elution and analysis by western blotting. As expected, HA-tagged PEDV N could be precipitated with Myc-tagged PEDV N but not with empty beads, indicating specificity of the homo-oligomeric interaction (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, both N proteins from related CoVs also displayed specific interaction with PEDV N, both co-eluting with Myc-tagged PEDV N (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, we observed slight non-specific binding in the case of PDCoV N-HA despite stringent washing conditions. Therefore, we utilized a GST pulldown assay as an alternative and independent verification of these results.",

Bacterial and HEK293T cell lysates were incubated with GSH FF resin overnight to allow for bait-prey interaction. After removing non-specific binding by multiple rounds of washing, the bound proteins were released and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bait and prey proteins were detected by Coomassie staining and western blotting with indicated antibodies, respectively. HA-PEDV N could only be observed when pulled down with GST-PEDV N, while no HA-PEDV N was observed when pulled down with GST, demonstrating the specificity of the assay (Fig. 1B). Next, we performed the GST pulldown experiment with PDCoV N and TGEV N as prey proteins. Similarly, we found that PDCoV N-HA and TGEV N-FLAG only co-eluted with GST-PEDV N, indicating that N proteins from both TGEV and PDCoV bound to PEDV N specifically (Fig. 1B). Both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown results indicated that interspecies hetero-oligomers of CoV N proteins are possible, suggesting conservation of the oligomerization motifs and function of nucleocapsid proteins among swine CoVs.

However, there have been conflicting reports about the necessity of viral RNA in promoting or assisting CoV N self-oligomerization. Some reports observed RNaseA susceptibility of the oligomeric complex (Narayanan et al., 2003; Verheije et al., 2010), while others detected intact higher CoV N oligomers despite the absence of RNA (Cong et al., 2017; Jayaram et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2010). To investigate whether the presence of RNA influences interspecies association between these swine enteric CoV N proteins, GST pulldown experiments were performed with or without RNaseA treatment. First, however, we tested whether or not RNA affected PEDV N homo-oligomerization in this assay setup. HEK293T cell lysate containing HA-tagged PEDV N was mixed with GST-PEDV N bacterial lysate and split into two equal parts. The lysate mixtures were either treated with RNaseA or PBS buffer for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The absence of RNA after the treatment was assured by performing RT-PCR reactions with primers specific to the PEDV N gene (Fig. 3). The lysate mixtures were then incubated with GSH FF resin overnight to compare the amount of HA-PEDV N pulled down by GST-PEDV N in the presence or absence of RNA. Our results across three independent experiments consistently showed a slight but noticeable increase in GST-PEDV N in the elution fraction after RNaseA treatment (Fig. 3). Moreover, the amount of HA-PEDV N pulled down in the absence of RNA seemed to be greater than that observed in the presence of RNA, suggesting that RNA interferes with the ability of PEDV N to bind to each other. We also consistently observed a slight decrease in the level of tagged PEDV N in the input fraction after the lysates were treated with RNaseA, implying decreased overall stability of PEDV N in the absence of RNA. Similar decreases in protein levels were not observed with TGEV or PDCoV N proteins (see below), suggesting specificity of the phenomenon.",

While increased GST-PEDV N was still similarly observed in the eluted fraction in the absence of RNA, both PDCoV N and TGEV N were pulled down by GST-PEDV N much less efficiently in the absence of RNA (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the total amount of the tagged CoV N proteins did not decrease, arguing against the possibility that TGEV or PDCoV N proteins were more prone to degradation without the bound RNA (Fig. 3, \u2018input\u2019 lanes). These results suggest that the presence of RNA immensely helps strengthen hetero-oligomerization between PEDV N and other CoV N proteins but renders homo-oligomerization between PEDV N weakened. Although not an absolute requirement for interspecies complex formation, RNA could act as a bridge for N proteins from different species to form the complex, implying the heterologous protein-protein interactions are significantly weaker or less specific than the homologous interaction. Even though the levels of RNA purified from RNaseA-treated lysates were below the detection limit of spectrophotometer (data not shown) and could not produce visible RT-PCR products, we could not rule out the possibility of leftover small RNA fragments mediating heterologous CoV N protein binding, giving rise to much fainter TGEV N or PDCoV N bands that co-eluted with GST-PEDV N. In summary, the results in this section demonstrate conserved association capability among different CoV N proteins but suggest some differentiating features, especially the influence of RNA on each complex, between homo- and hetero-oligomers involving PEDV N.",

To investigate how this protein-protein interaction might affect PEDV replication, we transiently transfected VeroE6 cells with varying amounts of the pCAGGS plasmid expressing N proteins from either PDCoV or TGEV for 24 h before infection with PEDV-mCherry (MOI = 0.0001) and followed the course of viral replication for each condition. The levels of CoV N expression were verified by western blotting against tags attached to each N protein (Fig. 4A). Cell culture supernatants were collected at 24, 48 and 72 hpi to determine virus titers by TCID50 assay (Fig. 4B\u2013D). The results showed that VeroE6 cells transiently transfected with either PEDV N or TGEV N showed a dose-dependent increase, up to an order of magnitude, in PEDV-mCherry titers compared to VeroE6 cells transfected with a blank vector (Fig. 4B and D).

VeroE6 cells expressing N from PEDV and TGEV clearly accelerated PEDV syncytia formation and spread. By 36 hpi, most cells displayed signs of profuse infection; by 48 hpi, infected cells were dead and detached compared to infection in wild-type VeroE6 cells (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, PDCoV N stably expressed in VeroE6 cells significantly suppressed PEDV spread; even at 48 hpi, no extensive syncytia had formed (Fig. 5B). Quantification of supernatant PEDV-mCherry titers by TCID50 assay also reflected the extent of syncytium formation. At 36 hpi, VeroE6 cells expressing TGEV N or PEDV N yielded about a hundred times more infectious PEDV virus particles than VeroE6 cells, while those expressing PDCoV N resulted in an infectious titer about ten times lower. By 48 hpi, PEDV replication in wild-type VeroE6 cells had started to catch up and closed the gap to about one order of magnitude. However, VeroE6-PDCoV N cells still showed significantly slower PEDV replication kinetics (Fig. 5C). As expected, we noted that the suppressive effect from VeroE6-PDCoV N cells was stronger than that observed in transiently transfected VeroE6 cells. This could be because the stable cell line homogeneously expresses PDCoV N which can directly exert an effect on the infecting virus, while only a fraction of infected cells was transfected (resulting in the effect being diluted out by cells that were infected but not transfected).",

To explore if similar mechanisms were employed by TGEV N and PDCoV N on PEDV replication, we then probed viral RNA production inside these VeroE6-based cell lines using RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells infected with PEDV-mCherry at 24, 36 and 48 hpi. Specific primers were used to quantify viral genomic RNA (ORF1a gene; gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (5\u2032UTR- S gene; sgRNA) production. The levels of each RNA species were normalized to the levels of GAPDH mRNA from the same conditions and were expressed as relative to RNA levels at 24 hpi from infected VeroE6 cells. As previously observed, VeroE6-PEDV N cells drastically increased sgRNA and gRNA production at 36 and 48 hpi (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, VeroE6-PDCoV N cells displayed stunted PEDV RNA transcription and replication; even at 48 hpi, the levels of sgRNA and gRNA were still lower than those observed in VeroE6 cells at 24 hpi (Fig. 5D). VeroE6-TGEV N cells moderately enhanced PEDV RNA synthesis compared to wild-type VeroE6 cells but did not reach the same level as VeroE6-PEDV N cells (Fig. 5B). According to the results, the presence of extraneous N proteins posed greater effects on gRNA replication than sgRNA transcription. These data corroborated with visual observation and quantitative measurement of infectious viral particle production. Together, they strengthened the findings in the transient expression experiments and suggest opposing directions of influence on PEDV replication mediated by N proteins derived from related CoVs.",

In an attempt to answer which roles and functions of PEDV N could be replaced by other CoV N proteins, we constructed an N-deficient PEDV infectious clone, pPEDV-mCherry-\u0394N, and determined whether supplying CoV N proteins in trans could replace the missing PEDV N protein from the PEDV's viral genome. Since the nucleotide fragment of the N gene in the viral genome may play other important roles in viral genome packaging or transcription, we employed a frameshift mutation strategy to silence N expression from the infectious clone while minimally disturbing the nucleotide sequence of the N gene. The original start codon in the N ORF, ATGGCT, was mutated to ATATGT, thereby shifting the start codon by two nucleotides, resulting in a +2 frameshift during translation (Fig. 6A). The mutated sequence theoretically produced a short unrelated peptide of 21 amino acids with early termination. We intentionally kept the mCherry gene in the construct as a visual indicator for sub-genomic mRNA transcription and protein expression in the virus rescue process. To verify the lack of N expression during PEDV reverse genetics rescue, we transfected the N-deficient infectious clone into HEK293T cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that N expression was completely diminished in cells transfected with the N-deficient infectious clone compared to the wild-type pPEDV-mCherry (Fig. 6\nB).",

We found that additional transfection could ensure sufficient PEDV N expression in infected cells and facilitated PEDV replication better than untreated VeroE6-PEDV N cells (data not shown). Limited syncytium formation was observed only in VeroE6-PEDV N cells inoculated with the supernatant derived from HEK293T cells co-transfected with pCAGGS-PEDV N-Myc (Fig. 7C). However, the infecting viruses could not continuously propagate to produce extensive syncytia as routinely observed with the rescue of pPEDV-mCherry. This is probably due to insufficient PEDV N protein levels as supplied by the stable cell line compared to virally encoded PEDV N. Remarkably, supernatants from HEK293T cells co-transfected with a plasmid encoding TGEV N or PDCoV N did not contain infectious progeny from virus rescue, displaying no second-round PEDV-mCherry replication in VeroE6-PEDV N cells as determined by mCherry expression or syncytia formation (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that, despite some conserved function of N proteins among porcine enteric CoVs in self-oligomerization and assistance during viral RNA synthesis or protein expression, N is not fully interchangeable among CoVs for generating PEDV infectious virus progeny. These results imply that the suppressive or enhancing effects on PEDV replication in cells expressing PDCoV N or TGEV N may reflect their effects on viral RNA replication and/or viral protein expression, rather than their abilities to supply complementary N proteins during RNP core formation or virion assembly.",

            "text": "First, we provided evidence of cross-interaction between CoV N proteins despite low sequence similarity among them. Amino acid sequence analyses on PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV N proteins revealed that the proteins can be divided roughly into two structural domains (NTD and CTD) with relatively high conservation and three intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with relatively low conservation located in the middle and at the two termini (Fig. 8\n). This domain analysis is consistent with previous crystallographic studies on SARS-CoV and MHV N, which also suggested conserved general structural organization of CoV N (Chang et al., 2009; Cong et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2006). Moreover, immunological data documenting cross-reactivity of antibodies against N proteins from TGEV or PDCoV with PEDV N further implied shared topological similarity between these CoV N proteins (Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016). Nevertheless, precise molecular mechanisms mediating interspecies oligomerization of CoV N proteins remain to be determined. Structural and biochemical studies of SARS-CoV N strongly suggest a role of CTD as a major mediator for CoV N dimerization. Moreover, CTDs of N proteins from SARS-CoV and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), despite diverse sequences, could adopt well-conserved structures, implying similar approaches to oligomerization, at least at a gross structure level (Yu et al., 2006). However, since CoV N CTDs formed intricate molecular interaction networks during dimerization (Chang et al., 2014), it is unlikely that CoV N proteins from different species could replace all these specific molecular interactions. Consistent with our results that hetero-oligomer formation is highly sensitive to the presence of RNA, a more likely possibility is that RNA-protein interactions play a more dominant role in interspecies CoV N interactions than protein-protein interactions.",

            "text": "Next, we asked if N proteins from different CoVs can replace PEDV N function during viral RNA and protein synthesis. During the rescue of the N-deficient PEDV infectious clone, we showed that supplying N protein from any CoV in trans can initiate first-round sgRNA transcription and protein expression. Most likely, this function stems from the shared intrinsic ability of CoV N to bind viral RNA and act as an RNA chaperone that initiates RNA replication and/or transcription processes (Zuniga et al., 2007, 2010). These results support previous notions that CoV N proteins play important roles during CoV rescue. For instance, rescue of TGEV infectious RNA required at least co-transfection of mRNA encoding the N protein (Yount et al., 2000). Schelle et al. demonstrated that an N-deficient HCoV229E RNA vector replicon carrying the GFP gene can produce sgRNA and express GFP from the vector when co-transfected with N from PEDV, a closely related virus, but not from MHV, a more distantly-related one (Schelle et al., 2005). We noted a similar preference in our experiments. Between TGEV N and PDCoV N, the former is more effective in replacing the indigenous PEDV N than the latter. Since both PEDV and TGEV belong to the alphacoronavirus genus, while PDCoV is classified as a deltacoronavirus, TGEV N would be expected to be functionally and structurally closer to PEDV N, and hence able to form replication/transcription complexes and participate in PEDV replication with higher compatibility than PDCoV N.",

            "text": "Although both TGEV N and PDCoV N can oligomerize and perform some functions during g/sgRNA transcription, they alone cannot totally replace all PEDV N's functions. Without native PEDV N, infectious PEDV virions could not be detected in the presence of TGEV or PDCoV N, implying that other functions are not interchangeable. These critical functions might involve viral core assembly as CoV N participates in many steps during viral core or virion assembly (McBride et al., 2014). For instance, several reports showed that CoV N is involved, directly or indirectly, with recognition of specific packaging signals for genome packaging (Hsieh et al., 2005; Hsin et al., 2018; Kuo et al., 2014). Since RNA packaging signals among CoVs are distinct in terms of length and sequence, even closely related CoV N might not be able to recognize PEDV packaging signals. Similar compatibility issues have been raised in the case of viral interference between different types of influenza viruses (Baker et al., 2014). Another critical step that could be disrupted by heterologous CoV N is viral assembly through interactions between N and M proteins. It is widely accepted that CoV N and M proteins interact to form the viral core, but different CoVs utilize different regions of N in binding to their own M proteins. For instance, while MHV utilizes the very C-terminal end of N to bind M, SARS-CoV N uses the middle disordered linker for the interaction (He et al., 2004b; Narayanan et al., 2000). In addition, although both TGEV and MHV N proteins used their C-termini to bind M, the N binding sites on TGEV M and MHV M are very distinct (Hurst et al., 2005; Kuo and Masters, 2002), pointing to high specificity for each virus. It could be argued that our use of C-terminally tagged CoV N proteins might have contributed to failure in rescuing infectious PEDV from pPEDV-mCherry-\u0394N, possibly due to interference with N-M protein interaction. Nevertheless, our results showed that addition of a Myc tag at the C-terminus of PEDV N did not completely ruin protein-protein interaction required for viral assembly as PEDV N-Myc remained capable of producing infectious virions. Moreover, using untagged PEDV N and TGEV N during reverse genetics rescue of pPEDV-mCherry-\u0394N gave similar results to those presented in Fig. 7 (data not shown), suggesting that the inability of TGEV N or PDCoV N to rescue infectious PEDV lacking endogenous nucleocapsid protein stemmed largely from incompatibility of interspecies protein interaction rather than the interference from epitope tags. In all, it is conceivable that not all of N functions could be replaced by the protein originating from other viral species, even though N proteins from PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV can cross-assemble, form high-order oligomers and aid in RNA synthesis processes.",

            "text": "Notably, we observed completely opposite effects of TGEV and PDCoV N proteins on PEDV replication. We noticed that, in the presence of RNA, homologous binding between PEDV N itself is weakened and cross binding between PEDV N and the other N proteins is strengthened. During co-infection, where viral gRNA is ubiquitous, the RNA could act as a tethering bridge to stabilize the formation of heterologous oligomers, which may not be a productive core structure for PEDV virion assembly and may interrupt the optimal processes in viral replication that prefer the homo-oligomer of N. Such interruption could explain the suppressive effect of PDCoV N. Nevertheless, the existence of interspecies CoV N oligomers might not be the only factor dictating the effect of extraneous CoV N proteins on PEDV replication. TGEV N also forms RNA-dependent interspecies oligomers with PEDV N and could have resulted in similar suppression. Instead, we observed a small enhancement effect on PEDV replication in the presence of TGEV N. This could be the net outcome of other oligomerization-independent roles of TGEV N that indirectly enhance PEDV replication. A study by Zhao et al. showed that, when compared to single-virus infection, co-infection of TGEV and PEDV could synergistically enhance rupture to tight and adherens junctions of the intestinal epithelial cells IPEC-J2 by suppressing expression of proteins that help form the junction (Zhao et al., 2014). Such altered barrier integrity is possibly caused by CoV N and facilitate viral replication. Another possible role of PEDV or TGEV N that could lead to enhancement of PEDV replication is to act as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (Cui et al., 2015). Using MHV N as a model, they found that CoV N can bind and suppress host antiviral RNAi, leading to increased viral protein expression and subsequent viral replication. More remarkably, they found that N proteins of alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV and PEDV, also have this ability. Indeed, among different CoV N proteins, they found that TGEV N was among the most active and MERS-CoV N was the least active (Cui et al., 2015). Therefore, N from TGEV may also employ this mechanism in promoting PEDV replication, while some other CoV N proteins might not be capable of this function. These are interesting hypotheses currently under investigation, which could reveal more complexity of co-infection between these viruses.",

Furthermore, co-expression experiments revealed interesting phenomena in which different CoV N proteins exert vastly different effects on PEDV replication. These results raise even more questions. For example, in the context of co-infection, in which all other viral components are present, what would be the net outcomes on replication kinetics of each virus? Are there effects from other viral components? Considering the opposing effects on PEDV replication of N proteins from TGEV, an older virus emerging prior to PEDV, and PDCoV, a newly emerged one, is it possible that nucleocapsid proteins could act as one of the factors in permitting or limiting emergence of enteric swine CoVs? If so, what is the effect of PEDV N on newer CoVs such as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which has been detected predominantly in farms encountering PEDV epidemics (Zhou et al., 2018), and vice versa? Further investigation into these questions would give valuable insights for us to better understand co-infection events and their implications for the emergence of novel enteric swine viruses.",
