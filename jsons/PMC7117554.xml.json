Second, cancer treatments themselves can predispose patients to the more serious harmful effects of COVID-19. Should patients risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in order to receive treatment for cancer? The available evidence is limited, but suggests that the symptoms of COVID-19 are probably more severe in patients with cancer than for those without. Clear evidence exists that older age and higher levels of comorbidity are associated with more severe COVID-19 symptoms and adverse outcomes; this consideration is highly relevant to patients with cancer3,4.",

We emphasize the importance of meticulous screening of patients and staff (including consideration of symptoms and travel history) before permitting entry into outpatient clinics together with the importance of engineering patient flow to minimize contact between patients. These strategies are also important for staff safety, to ensure maximal availability of both clinical and nonclinical staff. To reduce the number of clinic visits and the inherent risks, shorter radiotherapy fractionation and conversion of intravenous to oral systemic regimens can be considered. The opportunity exists for stopping or reducing frequency of selected maintenance treatments, or those with a long duration. For example, at our centre we will be moving from 2-weekly to 4-weekly administration of durvalumab as consolidation therapy for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (reducing frequency), and recommending the consideration of treatment breaks for those receiving maintenance pemetrexed, or even forgoing maintenance pemetrexed entirely.",

The selection of specific indications for which interventions should be postponed is beyond the scope of this Comment; however, a number of published resources are available that quantify the benefits of radiotherapy and systemic therapy6,7. We emphasize that even within one group of this hierarchy, prioritization and exceptions will exist. Ongoing prioritization requires regular data-driven reassessments in order to minimize harm. Importantly, how long the patient has (already) been waiting will change case priority; what constitutes an acceptable delay will vary by priority level, indication and the contextual factors described previously. We note that the availability of resources for systemic therapy, radiotherapy and surgery will fluctuate independently to some degree, requiring separate prioritization.",

Some clinic visits could be replaced with \u2018virtual\u2019 assessments conducted by videoconference and/or telephone.

Clear evidence exists that, for certain indications, treatment postponement can adversely affect outcomes. For example, a 16% increased risk of death exists for every month of delay of radiotherapy for patients with head and neck cancer (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.32)8. Furthermore, delays in receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.17 per 4 weeks)9 and breast cancer (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.15 per 4 weeks)10 are associated with inferior survival. Although data are currently insufficient, negative effects on outcomes owing to treatment delays seem very plausible for many other indications.
