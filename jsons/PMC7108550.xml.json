Recently there has been an interest in developing bead-based assays where micrometre-sized solid particles (beads) are used for attaching probe biomolecules, such as antigens for immunoassays. The probes are attached by reacting different particles (in suspension) with solutions of different probes, thus reducing the problems associated with attaching molecules to microarrays. For a typical assay, a selection of different particles is used, each with a different probes attached. A suspension of such particles is reacted with the sample and the binding measured. Unlike a microarray, where the molecular probe is identified from its location in a matrix, each particle must carry a unique identifier, i.e. a tag or code, as shown in Fig. 2. After reaction every particle is analysed for (a) fluorescence indicating binding of (for example) an antibody and (b) the unique code. The combination of these two allows identification of the probe molecule and therefore the antibodies present in the sample.",

A large number of techniques have been proposed for encoding beads, some of which have been reviewed elsewhere22,23 and research in this area has been extensive. This review provides an overview of current microparticle encoding techniques and addresses the advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques. Important points to consider when reviewing encoding techniques are; the encoding capacity of each technique (how many molecules may potentially be identified using each technique, which determines the types of assays it can be used for); the simplicity of the manufacturing process (i.e. is it realistically possible to manufacture the number of encoded particles required for a particular assay); the simplicity and accuracy of the reading system; robustness of the technique (i.e. how likely is it that errors occur during code reading); and the compatibility of the technique with other aspects of the assay, in particular the chemical processes involved in molecule binding or synthesis onto the particles, and the method used to indicate binding of target molecules to the microparticle (i.e. whether the particles can actually be used for their suggested applications). An additional consideration is the potential for miniaturization of the entire reading system into an integrated \u2018lab-on-a-chip\u2019 device.",

Typically latex microspheres are soaked in an organic solvent so that they swell, allowing dye molecules to enter the material viapores. When placed in an aqueous solution, the spheres shrink, trapping the dye molecules within the latex. Using a single dye at different concentrations, a multiplexed assay of six different cytokines has been demonstrated.24 The code is determined from the fluorescence intensity of each particle, read using a conventional fluorescence activated flow-cytometer (FACS). A typical statistical analysis of particle fluorescence intensity is presented in the histogram in Fig. 3, demonstrating good separation between six different fluorescence intensities. Each set of beads within a band of fluorescent intensities has a unique code. The main issue with this technology is maintaining a very low coefficient of variation (CV) between sets of beads. Practically there is little scope for increased multiplexing using this single-dye technology without introducing overlap in the populations.",

Beads encoded using this method are used in commercially available bead-based assay instruments, such as Luminex Corporation's xMAP technology.25 This technology uses a proprietary method to uniquely encode each bead with a mixture of two fluorescent dyes, one with a red and one with an infrared emission spectrum. The unique emission spectrum produced by a particular ratio of the two dyes serves as the identification method. The company advertises 100 unique codes available using this method,26 and Luminex beads have successfully been used, for example, to detect 8 different cytokines,27 and 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene encoding the human NAT2enzyme.28 The xMAP technology was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use as part of a system to identify 12 different viruses by analysis of their genetic material.14 A green fluorescent dye is used to indicate binding of a molecule to the microparticles, so as not to interfere with the spectrum of the fluorescent code.

In particular, the dye-based methods are subject to variability of dye content in the beads, which causes the fluorescence intensity levels to vary. In addition, using many emission wavelengths for encoding may cause interference with the fluorescent dyes used as target binding reporters.

These particular rare-earths were chosen due to their efficient visible emissions in the aluminosilicate matrix, their overlapping absorption spectra (for excitation purposes), and their non-interference with typical organic fluorescent markers used to indicate binding in a biological assay. Once the glass blocks were cast, they were drawn into 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm glass canes and multiple canes doped with different glass were assembled in an order that defined a code. The cane assembly was fused in a graphite press at 900 \u00b0C, and the whole fused assembly drawn into a ribbon fibre 20 \u03bcm thick and 100 \u03bcm wide. The ribbon fibre was then cut into 20 \u03bcm sections using femtosecond laser pulses of wavelength 800 nm and average power 100 mW.",

The number of possible codes using this technique, for a barcode with N elements and C colours, is given by (CN + CN/2)/2 when N is even and (CN + C[N+1]/2)/2 when N is odd. These numbers arise from the number of possible combinations of colours in all positions, taking account of the fact that symmetrical barcodes can be read from either end, as there are no orientation indicators for reading. Using the six positions and four different rare-earth elements shown, the number of non-degenerate combinations (and hence the number of possible unique codes) is (46 + 43)/2 = 2080. The authors also fabricated glasses doped with mixtures of two rare-earth elements; the emission spectrum of the Tm + Dy combination is included in Fig. 4(B). Such two element combinations increase the colour palette to nine and hence the number of codes 265 000. By extending the colour palette to include triple element combinations, the authors claim that >106 codes would be theoretically achievable using this technique.

Hybridised to this DNA strand are a number of segments of RNA, each with a fluorescent dye attached. The combination of the emission spectra of the dyes attached to each RNA segment, together with each dye's position along the strand constitutes the code. The principle was demonstrated for an mRNA expression assay.36 The mRNA strands under investigation are bound to a biotinylated capture probe, and the fluorescent RNA-encoded reporter probes complementary to mRNA sequences of interest are added, and bind to the corresponding complementary mRNA (see Fig. 6(A)). The biotinylated capture probes are attached to a streptavidin coated slide (Fig. 6(B)), and an electric field applied to stretch out the reporter probes along a pre-defined direction for reading. Biotinylated oligonucleotides are added which are complementary to the repeats at the 5\u2032 end of the reporter probes, and thus bind, allowing the 5\u2032 end of the reporter probes to bind to the surface of the streptavidin coated slide. This locks the reporter probes in position after the electric field is turned off. The slides are removed and examined in a fluorescence microscope. Microscope images of the fluorescent reporters (Fig. 6(C)) are analysed for the position and spectrum of each fluorescent segment by scanning along the alignment direction, thus decoding each reporter probe. The demonstrated limit of detection was in the range 0.1\u20130.5 fM.",

The first of these used aggregates of silver nanoparticles with organic molecules chosen for their specific Raman spectra,37 termed \u2018Composite Organic\u2013Inorganic Nanoparticles (COINs)\u2019. The particles are manufactured by placing seed silver nanoparticles in a solution of silver nitrate and a Raman label, Fig. 7(A). The silver particles grow in the solution and aggregate with the Raman labels to form the COINs, as shown in the TEM images of Fig. 7(B). Raman spectroscopy of the COINs reveals particular dominant peaks, whose Raman shift depends on the particular organic Raman label used (Fig. 7(C)). The silver nanoparticles enhance these peaks via Surfaced-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), a phenomenon where Raman signals from molecules in close proximity to rough metal surfaces are increased. Inclusion of more than one organic Raman label results in a larger number of dominant peaks, allowing more codes to be created (Fig. 7(D)). The authors claim that with 50 Raman labels, and Raman-shift peaks separated by 15 cm\u22121, millions of different codes are possible. Antibodies were conjugated to the COINs by adsorption, and a 2-plex sandwich immunoassay detecting IL-2 and IL-8 was demonstrated. The demonstrated sensitivity was \u223c1 pg ml\u22121, similar to competing technologies. While large numbers of codes are claimed using this technique, it appears that the spectra of the COINs become more complex (i.e. contain more unwanted features) as more dyes are used and depend very strongly on the concentration of the labels. It is therefore unlikely that very large numbers of codes (\u223c106) could be produced whilst maintaining robust error free readout.",

With the 6 different monomers used, up to 26 = 64 beads can be uniquely encoded. To demonstrate the reading of the Raman-encoded beads, beads with 12 unique codes among them were randomly inserted into 100 \u03bcm wells patterned by reactive-ion etching into a siliconcarrier. The beads were inserted from a suspension in ethanol, using mechanical assistance to force beads into the wells. An area of 48 beads was scanned using 110 \u03bcm steps over the carrier (see Fig. 8(B)) taking a Raman spectrum at each step. Each bead was uniquely associated with a Raman spectrum, as shown by the colour coding associating the beads in Fig. 8(C) with the spectra in Fig. 8(D). A deconvolution algorithm identifies which styrene monomers' signature peaks are present in each spectrum, by comparison against a set of pre-recorded spectra from each type of polystyrene,39 allowing a binary code to be associated with each bead. The deconvolution process took 15 min for the 48 beads, giving a readout rate of approximately three beads per minute. Attachment of peptides to the beads has been demonstrated,39 showing no appreciable effect on Raman spectra, allowing the codes to be read after attachment of molecules the surface of the beads.

After freeing from the surface by sonication, the nickel is etched away leaving arrays of gold nanodisk pairs held together by a silica \u2018backbone\u2019 (Fig. 9(A), step 2). Raman-active dyes are then attached to the gold (step 3),40 and the arrays scanned by confocal Raman microscopy, measuring the spectrum between 139 and 2789 cm\u22121 at each point and integrating the Raman intensity over the whole spectrum to create the pixel intensity. The Raman signal is increased between the gold disk pairs due to the higher dye concentration in these regions, as compared to other areas of the array, resulting in confocal Raman images of the type seen in Fig. 9(B) for the code 11111. The signal between the disk pairs is further enhanced due to surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Disk pairs can be removed from the array to create 0 digits, allowing any 5-bit binary strings to be encoded with this method, as seen for some examples in Fig. 9(C). The encoding capacity of these nano-disk arrays is then 25 = 32 codes. Using this technology, DNA assays have been demonstrated by attaching probeoligonucleotide sequences to the gold disks in place of the simple Raman labels. The probe sequences are then bound to Raman-labelled target DNA sequences at pM concentrations, which produces a visible code. The code thus acts as both binding reporter (via the target Raman labels) and target identifier. The encoding capacity can potentially be increased by using more disks in the array, and using a number of different Raman-active dyes, identified by filtering the Raman images according to the unique Raman properties of each dye. This technique is likely to be reasonably robust, however it is not clear how very large numbers of codes could be manufactured. The complex fabrication process also reduces the throughput for the manufacture of large number of rods, compared to many other encoding methods.",

            "text": "Alternative spectral encoding methods have been proposed, based around structuring beads to produce a unique reflection spectrum42,43 (rather than the emission spectrum of fluorescent dyes). In the first method,42 porous silicon particles were produced by galvanostatic anodic etching of silicon wafers. This etching method involves placing the wafer in an etch cell containing a solution of 48% HF in ethanol, such that it forms the anode of an electric circuit, with a cathode also immersed in the etch solution. A constant current applied to the cell etches the wafer, forming porous silicon. To form encoded particles, a sinusoidally varying current is applied to the etch cell, resulting in particles with a sinusoidal porosity variation. This porosity variation acts as a photonic bandgap material, resulting in a sharp reflectance peak at a certain wavelength, determined by the periodicity of the porosity variation. The period of the porosity variation is determined by the frequency of the current variation in the etch cell. Thus particles with different reflectance peaks can be produced (Fig. 10(A)). The peak reflectance occurs at a certain wavelength, this is used as the code to identify the particle. Multiple current frequencies can be applied to each particle, producing multiple reflectance bands (see Fig. 10(B)), which further extends the number of unique codes available. With the 15 reflectance bands demonstrated, including particles with three periodicities as demonstrated, approximately 500 unique codes could be obtained.",

            "text": "A related method,43 uses inverse opaline silica beads patterned with holes moulded from polystyrene sphere templates. The beads are formed by droplet crystallization of a suspension of silicananoparticles and polystyrene spheres in silicone oil. The polystyrene spheres are dissolved, leaving ordered depressions of the order of 200 nm in the surface of a silica bead of around 10 \u03bcm diameter. The depressions form a photonic crystal, giving the bead a reflection spectrum with a wavelength peak in a certain bandgap region. The position of this peak constitutes the identifying code, which can be varied by changing the size of the polystyrene spheres used to mould the depressions. Typical reflection spectra for seven different beads are shown in Fig. 11(A). A unique feature of this method over other encoding methods is that the presence of molecules on the bead surface changes the bandgap position, producing a shift in the spectral peak. This method can therefore be used for label-free identification of molecular binding. This was type of assay was demonstrated by attachment of three human tumor markers, antigens CA125, CA19-9 and CEA, to beads with three different reflection spectra. An assay was performed in which the beads were reacted with antibodies to each of the three antigens. The spectra with antigens attached and the shifted spectra after antibody binding are shown in Fig. 11(B). It can be seen that reliable detection is obtained for two of the bead types, although the bead with the shortest wavelength bandgap proves incapable of binding detection. The lowest detectable concentration for CA19-9 was 100 ng ml\u22121. The demonstrated encoding capacity of six shows this technology to useful only for very low levels of multiplexing, but could find applications as a label-free immunoassay.",

The earliest such technology, developed by 3D Molecular Sciences Ltd. (3DMS, Cambridge, UK), involves the patterning of the epoxy photo-polymer SU8.49 They developed two types of code; both defined and patterned using photolithographic selective cross-linking of the SU8. The first type, termed ImageCodes, are designed to be read on a flat plate and are relatively large in size (100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm). They are patterned with square arrays of holes, representing binary digits making up a code, Fig. 13(B). The L-shaped pattern of holes around the edge is used to identify the orientation of the particles, and the rest of the holes constitute the code for particle identification. The particles shown in Fig. 13(B) have an encoding capacity of 235\u2248 1010 codes. The second type is designed to be read in a more high-throughput, flow-based system. An example is shown in Fig. 13(C). The codes have different patterns of ridges along both edges, constituting a binary code. During reading, the particles flow past a laser beam, and the different ridges modulate the scattered light, which is monitored by a detector. In principle this provides high-speed, automated reading of the code on the particle but this was never demonstrated. The particles shown in Fig. 13(C) have an encoding capacity of 210 = 1024 codes. The attachment of DNA to the flow codes was demonstrated, proving their compatibility with biochemical assays.49",

Nickel and PTFE were electroplated in alternating layers of approximately 6 \u03bcm thickness, followed by a chrome adhesion layer and then a gold coating. The SU8 is removed and the finished particles lifted off by etching the copper sacrificial layer. The resulting particles are of dimensions 100 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm, with an 80 \u00d7 50 \u03bcm array of up to eight code spots, which are either present (\u20181\u2019) or absent (\u20180\u2019), creating a binary code, see Fig. 14(A). This particular scheme can encode 28 = 256 different microparticles, although increasing the number of bits would be possible, increasing the encoding capacity codes. The gold layer is used to provide a surface for chemical attachment (via thiols) and the nickel layer supplies mechanical stability. A significant disadvantage of this technique is the complex multi-step manufacturing process, which makes production of very large numbers of particles expensive and time consuming.",

            "text": "Pregibon et al.54 recently demonstrated an encoding technology very similar to the 3DMS ImageCodes. However, a significant difference in their work was the demonstration of encoding, analyte attachment (to the particles) and reading of the codes all within a microfluidic system. The method of manufacturing the encoded microparticles is shown in Fig. 15(A); two streams of the monomers of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) flow together down a microfluidic channel, remaining separate due to laminar inside microchannels. One stream contains fluorescently labelled monomers, that form the code region, while the other contains monomers and a biological probe (for example an oligonucleotide) for use in an assay. The particles are defined and patterned using UV light passed through a mask and a reduction lens; regions of high UV intensity polymerize the monomers forming a solid particle from which the un-crosslinked monomer is subsequently rinsed, leaving holes signifying binary \u20181\u2019 digits. The particles, shown in Fig. 15(B), feature a coding region on one half that consists of two orientation-identification elements and 20 digits of a binary code, again present (\u20181\u2019) or absent (\u20180\u2019) depending on the desired code. The example presented here has the capacity for 220\u2248 106 unique codes. The region surrounding the holes representing the code digits is fluorescent, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and allowing the code to be read simultaneously with the analysis of target attachment. The other half of the particle has the biological probe attached, for use in bead based assays using these particles. The disadvantages of this method are the larger concentrations of probe molecules required to obtain a loading level similar to most other bead-based technologies (around 50 times larger), and the fact that the technology may be problematic for protein assays, because of the potential for UV-induced denaturation of the probes during particle formation.",

            "text": "Another particle-based assay method has recently been demonstrated, which makes us of label-free binding detection viasurface plasmon resonance (SPR), combined with graphically encoded microparticles.57SPR involves the excitation of surface charge oscillations (surface plasmons) on a metal by incident light. To do this the momentum of the light must be made to match that of the surface plasmons using in this case, metal gratings for which light incident at a certain angle to the metal surface normal (the resonance angle) has the correct momentum to excite surface plasmons. The particles are manufactured as shown in Fig. 17(A): First a silicon wafer is etched to form a grating, followed by a second, larger scale etching to form the particle outlines. A PDMS replica is then moulded from the Si, into which a layer of SiO2 is deposited, followed by a thin layer of Cr and finally a gold layer, to form the SPR sensing layer. The particles are released by dissolving the PDMS; an example particle is shown in Fig. 17(B). The triangular notch at the particle's edge is an orientation marker, and square notches represent \u20181\u2019 digits of a binary number. In this case, the number can have 1 digit per side, giving 7 bits and an encoding capacity of 27 = 128 codes. It is clear that at least twice as many digits could be incorporated on the particle, allowing for more than 104 codes. Molecular binding is measured by focussing two laser beams onto the particles, forming a small range of incident light angles close to the surface plasmon resonance angle (Fig. 17(C)), at both positive and negative angles to the grating normal. The reflected light from the laser beam forms an image containing two dark bands at the two resonance angles (Fig. 17(D)): The relative position of these indicates the refractive index of the material above the gold layer, which changes upon molecular binding, thus shifting these dark bands and providing a binding indicator. Binding of 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121 human IgG to protein A immobilized on the particles was demonstrated, and successfully detected by shift of the SPR band. The experiment was, however, conducted using a flow cell with the particles fixed to the bottom throughout the target binding in order to obtain reference SPR band positions with no target bound, and so was not a true suspension assay. Again a disadvantage of this method is the complex particle manufacturing method, however the method demonstrates the potential for label-free highly multiplexed assays.",

This means that some of the bits can be reserved for error correction, for example parity checking or other error detection methods such as Hamming coding. Hamming coding is a mathematical operation by which a binary string is converted to a longer string containing the original code, plus extra error check digits. This longer code can be converted by a second mathematical operation on reading, to provide information about any errors (incorrect digits) in the code part of the string. This means that errors in the code reading can be identified and either corrected (for up to two errors) or the code rejected (for up to three errors). This makes these encoding methods very robust and allows a degree of tolerance in the reading and manufacturing process, with respect to code distortion, damage or contamination. Furthermore, the capacity of these encoding methods is not restricted by competition with bandwidth from the fluorescent assay binding reporters, unlike the fluorescence-based encoding methods.",

A code was written by selective bleaching of the dye, using light of wavelength 488 nm from a 30 mW argon-ion laser.48 The laser was deflected by an acousto-optic modulator, raster-scanned over the bead and writing the pattern by selective photobleaching. The code was \u201cread\u201d by illuminating the sphere with lower intensity light of the same wavelength (power level of 30 \u03bcW), exciting fluorescence in the non-bleached parts of the sphere, leaving the bleached regions dark. Examples of codes written using this method are shown in Fig. 18. The codes are dark bars whose width and intensity constitute the code elements: partial photo-bleaching can be used to adjust the fluorescence intensity in the code bars. An example of a two-level code (bleached/unbleached) is shown in Fig. 18(A), and a three-level code (bleached/partially bleached/unbleached) is shown in 18(B). Since the codes are written by scanning the laser beam over the sphere, the write time can be minimized by writing only in one dimension, creating what the authors term \u2018dot codes\u2019 (Fig. 18(C)). A cross section through this dot code is shown in Fig. 18(D) showing how three bleaching intensity levels can be distinguished. The authors use a rather complex encoding method, based around the possible combinations of width, bleaching intensity and position of the dark bars. Using two intensities and three bar widths, the authors claim an encoding capacity of 4 \u00d7 106 unique codes, increasing to 108 with the use of three intensity levels, although it is not clear how these numbers were obtained. Using a binary scheme based on bars of the quoted minimum width (1 \u03bcm) and the quoted encoding space (30 \u03bcm), would yield 230 = 109 codes, three orders of magnitude higher than the capacity obtained using their scheme.",

Another layer of PAH is deposited to trap the nanoparticles on the surface, followed by more layers for molecular binding. During code writing, a magnetic field is applied to the particles, permanently magnetizing the CrO2nanoparticles. For reading, a weak magnetic field turns the spheres into the correct orientation. Using the layer-by-layer coatings, the encoded microspheres were used in 3-plex immunoassays,59 using a red fluorescent reporter dye that did not interfere with the code fluorescence. The limit of detection was demonstrated to be 16 pg ml\u22121 for a TNF-\u03b1 sandwich assay.

In the simplest implementation, the pattern on the particle is a miniature diffraction grating a few micrometres in size, where information is encoded in the pitch of the grating, a.61 When the grating is illuminated with light at wavelength \u03bb, for example at normal incidence, a series of diffracted beams at angles \u03b1 are created, according to the equation a sin \u03b1 = m\u03bb, where m is an integer known as the order of the diffracted beam. Measurement of the first-order (m = 1) diffracted beam position (with respect to the zero order) gives direct information about the pitch a. More than one grating pitch can be superimposed on a single particle to increase the encoding capacity of this technique. The encoding capacity of this technique depends on the number of diffracted beams n that fit between 0 degrees and the maximum observable diffracted angle, and the number of gratings k superimposed on the particle. The number of available codes c is given by c = n!/[(n\u2212k)!k!]. Using this technique, we estimate that approximately 109 unique codes can theoretically be created from five superimposed gratings on a 100 \u03bcm long particle (and around 105 on a 20 \u03bcm particle).61 Two sets of gratings in mutually perpendicular directions (a two-dimensional grating) can increase this theoretical capacity to around 1021 codes on a 100 \u03bcm particle (around on 1014 on a 20 \u03bcm particle).61",

Methods for attaching DNA and antibodies to the SU8 particles have been developed;21,62 4-plex immunoassays and 2-plex DNA single point mutation (SNP) analyses were demonstrated using this encoding technology62 with a sensitivity of 5 nM for human IgG/anti-human IgG binding. Much larger numbers of diffractive codes can be manufactured by nano-imprinting into the surface of the particles.63 Diffraction gratings manufactured by this method are shown in the SEM images in Fig. 19(A) and (B), whilst Fig. 19(C) shows the diffraction patterns from an example set of 10 different coded particles with two superimposed gratings. One pitch remains constant, giving a diffracted beam denoted \u2018E\u2019, while the other pitch decreases moving from right to left, producing diffracted beams in positions D to N. The particular combination of two beam positions provides a code. Example diffraction patterns from a 2D grating are shown in Fig. 19(D). For a 100 \u03bcm particle the practical encoding capacity is around 103 codes for a 1D grating (around 106 codes for a two-dimensional grating) on a 100 \u03bcm particle, and around 100 codes on a 20 \u03bcm particle (around 104 for a 2D grating). This is much less than theoretically predicted and arises from manufacturing limitations, the practical limits on observable diffracted beam angle and the method used to design the superimposed gratings. However, for smaller particles (\u223c20 \u03bcm in size), this method has a higher encoding capacity than a typical occlusion based method. A significant advantage of this encoding method over others is the simplicity of the detection system: no microscope is required and the diffraction pattern is projected from the particle into the far field. It can be observed and read directly by a CCD/CMOS camera sensor with no intermediate optics. In addition, the code is generated from the periodicity of the structure on the particle surface, making it robust with respect to particle contamination, damage and rotation.61",

            "text": "An improvement on this method uses a diffractive technique based on writing holograms to encode the particles.64 The holographic method allows a complex diffractive structure to be written into the particles, which can in principle give any arbitrary diffraction pattern upon illumination. Thus the diffracted pattern can be tailored to produce many codes by projecting many diffracted beams within a small angular range and making efficient use of the observable angular space. The pattern may also be in binary form, allowing for error correction. Additionally the potential for writing and rewriting the code on the particles after manufacture increases the flexibility of the technology. The hologram is written into a particle manufactured from SU8 doped with a photochromic diarylethene dye. Writing is performed in a standard Fourier holographic setup64 in which a signal beam patterned with a binary code is focussed onto the dye-doped SU8 and interfered with a reference beam, forming an interference pattern which is recorded into the photochromic dye. Upon illumination of the hologram with a readout beam, the binary code is reconstructed on a CMOS camera sensor surface. An example of a reconstructed code from such a hologram on a particle is shown in Fig. 19(E), together with cross-sections indicating the binary signal to noise ratio (Fig. 19(F)). The top row and leftmost column of the pattern provide a reference frame for code reading, which defines a code grid. The remainder of the pattern constitutes a binary identification code, with bright points on the code grid indicating \u20181\u2019 bits and dark points indicating \u20180\u2019 bits. The example shown has 9 code bits, giving 512 unique codes. Theoretically, around 1024 unique codes could be obtained on a 100 \u03bcm particle (and around 4000 codes on a 20 \u03bcm particle).64 This number is obtained by calculating the size of the focussed code pattern for a given code-spot spacing, assuming that the entire area of a CMOS sensor is covered by the code reconstructed from the hologram, and assuming a fixed focal length of 25 mm for the writing lens. It is not yet clear how possible it is to obtain these numbers in practice. The holographic method has the advantage over diffraction gratings in that no undesired features appear in the diffraction pattern. The holographic technique does not suffer the same restrictions on encoding capacity as the grating based method. The method still only requires very simple optics for reading, however each particle has to be aligned to the same orientation as during code writing. This is the same problem described for the photobleached fluorescent microspheres,58\u201361 and could be overcome in a similar manner, by incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles into the SU8. One major advantage of this technique is that the code is non-permanent, it can be written, erased and re-written several times depending on the photochromic dye used.65",

Illumination with a red laser produces a diffraction pattern from the particle of the form shown in Fig. 19(G). This pattern represents a 15-bit binary code, where each bright stripe represents a \u20181\u2019 bit and dark areas of equivalent size to these stripes represent \u20180\u2019 bits. This code pattern allows for 215 = 32 768 codes, although in practice only 384 codes are currently used to indentify the beads: other bits on the code are used for error checking and other purposes such as sample and lab ID. The particles are reacted with the analyte solution in a single well of a standard multi-well plate, and transferred into the Bead Xpress reader, which deposits them into a grooved plate, so that they are aligned for reading. In addition to the red code-readout laser, the particles are also interrogated with a green laser for fluorescent binding indication. The company provides particles with immobilized oligonucleotides for genotyping assays, in addition to carboxylated bead sets for custom probe attachment. Although only a recent introduction to the market, the technology has been usedmple for analysing SNPs indicative of Kawasaki disease.67",

They have been shown to have molecular concentration sensitivities comparable to both traditional ELISAs and microarrays, making them realistic future candidates for high throughput, low sample volume replacements for theses technologies. The methods used to encode microparticles can be divided into two main technologies: The first is spectroscopic encoding, in which the reflection, fluorescence or Raman spectrum of the particle constitutes the code; the second is graphical (or occlusion) encoding, in which a pattern is encoded on or into a microparticle, and read directly using a microscope with CCD camera and machine vision software, or indirectly by analysis of a diffraction pattern.

The reliance on signal intensity as a code in highly multiplexed fluorescence-based technologies may lead to errors in reading as the number of codes increases due to variations in spectral intensity. Also the use of fluorescence for biochemical assays is not completely compatible with fluorescent-based encoding. DNA/RNA based fluorescent barcodes solve this compatibility issue by acting as both the code and binding reporter; however the complexity of chemical synthesis and reaction involved in using these codes is increased. Fluorescence based flow-cytometric assay technologies with approximately 100 unique codes are in commercial use,25 demonstrating that they have a promising and well-defined place for reliable assay encoding in applications with low multiplexing requirements, such as many common immunoassays. These methods are however not sufficiently robust to be used in assays involving much more than \u223c102 codes, due to intensity variations and the lack of error correction methods in the encoding system. Structured fluorescent codes, such as those based on striped rare earth-doped glasses and dye-labelled RNA strings offer higher multiplexing capabilities, although have increased manufacturing or chemical synthesis complexity, respectively.",

            "text": "Graphical methods offer much higher encoding capacities (of the order of 106 codes on a 100 \u03bcm particle). They are very simple to make, are robust and enable error detection mechanisms to be utilized. The encoding capacity depends on the size of the particle and the resolution with which the code elements can be manufactured; using a simple single step lithography technique as for the particles in Fig. 13(B), around 1024 codes could be manufactured on a 200 \u03bcm particle. Such large numbers are of little practical use, but provide the necessary redundant bits for robust detection of particle orientation, with detection and correction of read errors. They do not require fluorescence, thereby decoupling the code from the chemical assay readout. An important point is that the manufacture of these codes is trivial, single step photolithography of photo-polymers on wafers is a well-established and high throughput technique. Large numbers of these particles can be quickly, easily and reproducibly manufactured: For example, approximately 1 600 000 particles of 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm can be manufactured on a single 6\u201d wafer in one lithography step. The main disadvantage of the graphical methods is that for large encoding capacities, the particles need to be approximately 10 times larger than the spectrally encoded particles (i.e. dimensions of hundreds rather than tens of micrometres). Therefore, highly multiplexed assays require higher sample volumes for reaction than an equivalent number of spectroscopically encoded beads. However, the volumes are still relatively small. For example, assume that the micro-sample volume is 20 times larger than the combined volume of all the particles used in an assay. If the assay uses 10 000 particles, each of 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 5 \u03bcm in size, the solution volume is 10 \u03bcl, which can be easily accommodated in a single well of a standard multi-well plate.",
