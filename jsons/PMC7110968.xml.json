However, recent estimates claim that the number of current targets is over an order of magnitude lower than it could be.2, 3 On the other hand, the number of organic molecules that can act as drugs is also a matter of debate. More than 100 million small chemical compounds have been already synthesized for their screening on specific targets in public and private laboratories.4 In addition, it is not only a matter of quantity but also of quality. Until recently, medicines have been discovered either as a result of unexpected investigations\u2014by inspection of natural substances traditionally considered as therapeutic\u2014or in extensive experimental blind screening studies.5 These drugs, although proven to be useful in the treatment of several pathologies, have significant downsides, like important side effects or low efficiency.

In QSAR modeling, the predictors include physicochemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors of chemicals. As a result, a simple mathematical relationship is established. Applications of QSAR can be extended to any molecular design purpose, including prediction of different kinds of biological activities, lead compound optimization and prediction of new structural leads in drug discovery. The process of building a QSAR model is similar, apart from what type of property is being predicted. It consists of several steps, which lead to the design of new compounds with the desired activity profile.19 The first step involves the selection of a training set of compounds with their experimental activities to build a QSAR model. Ideally, each of these activities should cover the range of possible values for that activity. The next step is to compute descriptors that contain sufficient relevant information about the biological phenomenon. Despite the initial difficulty to predict in advance which descriptor variables will be valuable once descriptors have been calculated, one of them should be included in the QSAR model. A correlation coefficient gives a quantitative measure of how well each descriptor describes the activity. Thus, the descriptor with the highest correlation coefficient can be picked. Next, data analysis is needed to calculate the best mathematical expression linking together the descriptors and biological activities, in which information relating the essential features of the chemical and biological data structure is obtained. In the final step, validation and predictions for non-tested compounds will take place. An experimental validation of the model needs to be done, for example, by verifying already biologically tested compounds (test-set). If the QSAR predicts within acceptable restrictions, it may be used for a more extensive prediction of more compounds. Results should be interpreted for the proposal and design of new compounds with the desired activity outline.",

The protocol of structure-based pharmacophore modeling involves an analysis of the complementary chemical features of the active site and their spatial relationships, and a subsequent pharmacophore model assembled with selected features. In this case, a pharmacophore can be defined on the analysis of the target binding site (macromolecule (without ligand)-based) or based on a macromolecule-ligand-complex. The macromolecule-ligand-complex-based approach is convenient when a ligand is located at the ligand-binding site of a macromolecular target and the key interaction points between ligands and macromolecule need to be determined. Again, with the spatial arrangement of properties such as hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, basic or acid groups, partial charges, or aromatic and aliphatic hydrophobic regions in the active site, a virtual 3D mold can be defined with a much lower computational complexity than the target described at an all-atom level.

At the simplest, building a 3D pharmacophore to find potential ligands and performing further docking studies on the target constitutes a combined approach. These integrated approaches fall into two classes: interaction-based and docking similarity-based methods. Interaction-based methods focus on identifying the key interactions between the protein and ligand using available physicochemical data. These interactions are then used to screen small molecule libraries for compounds capable of producing such an interaction profile. In contrast, docking similarity-based methods merge structure-based docking methods with ligand similarity methods. With these combinations, virtual screening becomes very efficient and allows exploring libraries of up to 106 small molecules.37, 38, 39, 40, 41\n",

The process of virtual screening consists of selecting compounds from large databases by using computational tools rather than physically screening them. Through this process, active compounds that could modulate a particular biomolecular pathway can be rapidly identified.

IGF-1R belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathway involving cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. The initial hit obtained from hierarchical VS was subsequently used as the query scaffold for the substructure search to build a focused library. The library was then screened against IGF-1R with an in-house pharmacophore-constrained docking protocol. Eventually, 15 out of 39 compounds exhibited inhibitory activity in enzymatic assessment. Strikingly, the two most potent inhibitors demonstrated an excellent inhibitory potency (IC50 = 57 and 61 nM, respectively), and also presented significant selectivity over the insulin receptor (IR), which is highly homologous to IGF-1R.56 The authors concluded that the promising selective IGF-1R inhibitors\u2014aside from being potential antitumor agents\u2014could be investigated as molecular probes to differentiate the biological functions of IGF-1R and IR.",

In 2011, Noha et al. decided to use ligand-based pharmacophore modeling to identify new compounds with affinity to IKK-\u03b2. The ligand-based pharmacophore model for this study was based on a set of five compounds with high activity (IC50 values of 100 nM or less) and at least a several-fold difference in selectivity for IKK-\u03b2 over NF\u03baB in an attempt to develop an IKK-\u03b2 inhibitor-specific pharmacophore model. The model was further refined using a dataset extracted from the literature of 44 biologically inactive compounds, 128 active compounds, and 12,775 several random decoy compounds. The top ten high-scoring compounds were tested in vitro. Among these, the most potent inhibitor (compound NSC-719177) could inhibit IKK-\u03b2 with an IC50 value of approximately 6.95 \u03bcM.59 Cell-based analyses were also conducted to test the ability of compound NSC-719177 to inhibit NF\u03baB activation in HEK293 cells stably transfected and carrying a luciferase reporter gene activated by a promoter composed of multiple copies of the NF-\u03baB response element.

This factor has been observed to be overexpressed in cancer patients, and its activation is significantly involved in chemotherapy resistance mechanisms. In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) it was reported that YY1 is overexpressed.101 The in vitro inhibition in ALL cell lines showed that YY1 has an important implication in chemoresistance in these cells. Based on these findings, our research group was particularly interested in identifying some inhibitors of the activity of this transcription factor employing CADDD tools. The elucidation of the structure of the YY1 and site-binding domain provides a new framework to understand the functions of this transcription factor and leads to the development of rational drug design for the treatment of ALL. An overview of YY1 structure and activity, its actions in lymphoblastic leukemia and chemoresistance, and how structural information and high-throughput screening have been or can be used for drug discovery will be provided in the future.",

However, thanks to recent advances in the development of physical and chemical models to simulate biomolecular processes, together with the production of increasingly powerful computational resources, discovering and designing new drugs as anticancer drugs is an affordable task for many research institutions and laboratories today. With the required computational hardware and software, and the expertise in biochemistry, biophysics, and biology, many projects that previously demanded a significant investment in time and money can be done today by a small group of researchers in their workstations. Moreover, challenging projects not even conceivable two decades ago can be today tackled with the access to a supercomputer. By using CADDD approaches, researchers are not only accelerating their steps and projects. Implementing molecular simulations in biomolecular research projects has increased our knowledge in fields such as structural and chemical biology at the point where these tools are considered as other useful facilities in the laboratory. The optimization of these techniques and methods occurs this way naturally in its theoretical feedback signaling system. Computational models generate useful predictions to be checked with experimental results, and biologists and physicians demand approaches that are more accurate to computational scientists.",

(A) Standard in silico drug design cycle consists of docking, scoring and ranking initial hits based on their steric and electrostatic interactions with the target site, which is commonly referred to as virtual screening. Generally, in the absence of structural information of a receptor, and when one or more bioactive compounds are available, ligand-based virtual prescreening is utilized. This prescreening method is carried out by similarity search. The basic principle behind similarity searching is to screen databases for similar compounds with the backbone of the lead molecule. (B) In many situations, 2D similarity searches of databases are performed using chemical information from the first generation hits. (C) One alternative approach employs a ligand-based pharmacophore strategy that is often partnered with structure-based docking that uses a more stringent scoring matrix to determine the relative score made by matching two characters in a sequence alignment. This enhances the enrichment of initial hits and identifies the best compounds for computational evaluation, which are the second generation hits. (D) In the second phase, the molecular interactions between the target and the hits often identify ligand-based sites for optimizing these metrics for a unique molecular chemotype. (E) Computer algorithms, compounds or fragments of compounds from a database are positioned into a selected region of the structure (docking). These compounds are scored and ranked based on their steric and electrostatic interactions with the target site. (F) Structure determination of the target in complex with a promising lead from the first cycle reveals sites on the compound that can be optimized to increase potency.",
