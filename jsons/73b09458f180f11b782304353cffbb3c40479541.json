The suggestions addressed are mainly to stop air recirculation and to increase the introduction of outdoor air(15). When such conditions are not met, we propose three hypothetic ways in which HVAC systems can contribute to virus transmission: A) Through air circulation in confined compartments with infected patients;",

This idea is reinforced by the fact that, in China, before the application of travel restrictions and other heightened control measures, a large proportion -as high as 86% -of SARS-COV-2 infections were undocumented and these were 55% as contagious as documented infections(6).The occurrence of the so-called super spreading events provides further indirect evidence for the airborne route to be considered, as well as for the ventilation effect on the dispersion of infective particles. Super spreaders are contagious individuals who, in given circumstances, transmit the virus to many more others(20)(29). These instances contribute to the heterogeneity of R0 and are dependent on many factors, including pathogen-specific, host and environmental. Healthcare facilities pose great risks for this type of events with COVID-19 rapid person-to-person transmission(30). The authors believe that factors such as high population density and possible dispersion of viral particles by ventilation systems with low ventilation rates could have contributed to superspreading events in such settings.A recent event illustrating airborne route as a major contributor for superspreading events occurred in a choir rehearsal where 45 out of 60 people were infected despite adequate caution measures for fomite and droplet transmission being taken and none of them presented symptoms(31).Past examples Back in 2003, a cluster of SARS in Hong Kong led researchers to believe that indirect transmission of the disease occurred. This happened presumably, from the index case to another individual staying in the same hotel floor, and some secondary cases occurred after indirect exposure in hospital facilities in a confined space (32). Other SARS outbreaks like the Amoy Garden outbreak in 2003 led to the hypothesis of, at least, an opportunistic airborne transmission (9)(13). Bathrooms sewage systems were the probable contamination route for residents at Amoy Gardens. Researchers believed that the drainage of contaminated fluids from one bathroom floor could have led the virus into the sewage system. It was also suggested that the droplets could enter other bathrooms by the negative pressure generated when the door is closed. The authors didn't found support for other routes of transmission such as the airborne(33). Also, during the 2003 SARS outbreak, an emergency room (ER) outbreak was studied. Researchers failed to trace a common source for several cases of SARS, especially amongst hospital care workers (HCWs). Samples were collected at multiple ER sites, including positive samples for the outlet of the central air supply. Air samples were collected at central air supply and all turned up negative. However, the operation of the ER was suspended three days earlier when air samples were collected (22).Other study of air distribution on a hospital ward where an outbreak of SARS took place provides evidence of an environmental transmission route for SARS in that setting.It was the largest nosocomial outbreak reported at the time and where airborne transmission was considered.(12)Other arguments towards an airborne transmission routeIn COVID19, as in other diseases, there has been considerable debate on airborne transmissibility in the absence of droplets and physical contact (4). According to their size and environment conditions particles will assume different trajectories and dissemination patterns. For airborne infectious particles longer distances for transmission are possible(23)(4)(17).",

This makes it plausible for easy aerosol(4) and fomite transmission (2)(35). Also, the virus has been detected in stool samples.(36)(35)In the 2015 MERS outbreak there was an environmental detection of infectious MERS-CoV in the air and on inaccessible surfaces suggesting that MERS-CoV might be transmitted via contact and airborne routes, and not only from droplet exposure (37)(4). Other issue supporting the hypothesis is the high basic reproduction number. The basic reproduction number (R0) represents the average number of new infections that an infectious individual generates in a totally na\u00efve population. Estimation for R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is variable but larger than the R0 for the MERS and SARS-CoV outbreaks.In the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the overall mean reproduction number reached values as high as ~11(28). This indicates larger transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in a confined setting(38)(28).",

However, factors related to HVAC systems in buildings have a role in airborne pathogen transmission (18)(4)(42)(17)(46). Additionally, the authors consider that the spreading of the disease among patients may be facilitated in facilities via common ducts, where there are no HEPA filters (47). Ventilation systems have been reported as a way of transmission/spreading of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS (18)(4). In the case of measles, an airborne infection caused by an RNA virus,HVAC systems are warranted in order to protect from nosocomial infections but, in such cases, HEPA filters must be used, not only in settings(4), but also in outlet exhaustion tubes. In tuberculosis, airborne transmission, specifically in healthcare facilities, is influenced by many factors but ventilation with fresh air is a major determinant to reduce transmission risk to staff and other patients. Low rate of air changes per hour and poor maintenance of ventilation systems are also associated with TB outbreaks(48)(49).",

Some of these have been implemented without a complete understanding of their effects on controlling viral spread, mostly because of the lack of knowledge on the transmission routes of the SARS-CoV-2. There are missing links in transmission and possible unknow indirect infection routes in many epidemiological studies. Pure aerosol transmission is denied by WHO but several pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. The witnessed rapid spread of the virus points out to an even more effective transmission route and hence, airborne transmission must be considered plausible. HCWs are, also, at greater risk of acquiring the infection and the most effective way of protection has been through the use of N95 masks(39)(40). Personto-person transmission is accepted and possibly asymptomatic patients can be a major source of contagiousness. The authors address HVAC as major source for indoor and environmental contamination that can explain the swift viral spread. The confirmation of such way of transmission can constitute a major shift in the battle against the pandemic. Upon considering the airborne transmission for the COVID-19 pandemics, urgent measures need to be taken to guarantee effective control of the pandemic. This can include the widespread recommendation for mask use, the use of more protective equipment for HCWs, as well as structural changes to hospital facilities regarding ventilation systems.",
