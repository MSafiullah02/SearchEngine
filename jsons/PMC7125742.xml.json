            "text": "Smallpox or Variola, a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus, is a large brick-shaped DNA virus with a diameter of about 200 nm (Fenner et al., 1988b). Smallpox has a fatality rate of 30% or more among unvaccinated persons; currently there is no known cure (Fenner et al., 1988a). The virus has a small infectious dose and is stable in an aerosol form; therefore, an aerosol release could cause a widespread outbreak (Harper, 1961, Wehrle et al., 1970). Although the disease smallpox has been eradicated worldwide, it is a major threat as a bioterrorism agent. It was probably first used as a biological weapon by the British during the French and Indian Wars in the mid-1700s. Contaminated blankets were distributed to the Indians to initiate outbreaks of the disease. The ensuing epidemics killed over 50% of the affected tribes (Breman and Henderson, 1988). In 1980, the same year that vaccination against Variola major (smallpox) ceased globally, the Soviet government began research to grow large quantities and adapt it for use in bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (Alibek, 1999). Today, with a lack of vaccinations, the long incubation period of the smallpox virus, and our rapid transportation capabilities, an outbreak could easily spread throughout the world. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an example of such rapid worldwide dissemination. Variola virus is considered a Category A Pathogen by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), meriting this ranking because of its high case-fatality rate and transmissibility.",

The virus typically has a 12\u201314-day incubation period before the victim may experience any symptoms such as high fever, headache, abdominal pain, and delirium.

Data on post exposure is sparse, but it is indicative of partial protection when vaccination occurs within 4 days of exposure (Mortimer, 2003). If the disease state does occur after a post exposure vaccine (given within 4 days), a reduction in severity is noticeable. Persons given the vaccine more than 4 days after exposure to the disease had a high incidence of severe and sometimes fatal smallpox. Unfortunately, because of the long incubation period, people may not realize they have been exposed in time for the vaccine to be effective.

To normalize the signals, the change in signal above background for each sample was divided by the change in signal above background of the highest virus concentration (2.5\u00d7107\n pfu/ml) tested. The change in signal above background for the 2.5\u00d7107\n pfu/ml Vaccinia virus sample was arbitrarily set to 100. The following calculation was used: change in signal above background for sample tested/change in signal above background for sample containing 2.5\u00d7107 pfu/ml Vaccinia virus\u00d7100. The mean and standard deviation for the normalized change in signal above background for four waveguides was calculated for each viral concentration tested. Each assay was performed at least two times.",
