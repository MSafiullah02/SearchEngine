In many Asian countries, including China, where viruses such as hepatitis B are endemic, FH is one of the most common diseases requiring immediate hospitalization. However, historically, it has been difficult to analyze the pathogenesis of FH due to a lack of available animal models. Fortunately, recent studies using a mouse FH model infected by murine hepatitis virus-3 (MHV-3) has provided significant insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease and has led to the development of some novel therapeutics [1].",

In susceptible inbred mouse strains such as Balb/cJ or C57BL/6, mice infected with MHV-3 develop severe hepatitis and die within 3\u20137 days, whereas A/J mice are resistant and develop no clinical signs of hepatitis [2]. The hallmark of MHV-3-induced FH in susceptible hosts is the presence of sinusoidal thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis in conjunction with the expression of a virus-induced procoagulant molecule, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), by monocytes/macrophages. Tissue deposition of FGL2 can directly activate a coagulation cascade, which is a phenomenon known as \u2018virus-induced procoagulant activity\u2019 (PCA) [3]. Interestingly, blocking FGL2 ameliorates MHV-3-induced liver injury, and fgl2 mutant mice display natural resistance to infection, suggesting that fgl2 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of FH [4], [5].",

The biological functions of TNF-\u03b1 are mediated by two functionally distinct receptors, p55 TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A) and p75 TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B) [6]. TNFR1 is the primary signaling receptor on most cell types and accounts for the proinflammatory, cytotoxic, and apoptotic effects due to the presence of a death domain in its cytoplasmic tail [7]. In contrast, TNFR2 lacks an intracellular death domain and predominantly mediates signals promoting cell proliferation [8]. Previous works from our group and others have shown that TNF-\u03b1-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis is responsible for the pathogenesis of FH caused by MHV-3. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were resistant to MHV-3 mediated FH [9], [10], [11]. However, which TNFRs are involved in this effect, and how they regulate the pathogenesis of FH are still uncertain.",

The parameters from the infected TNF-\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which have reduced tissue necrosis and prolonged survival time following MHV-3 infection [9], were used for controls. Additionally, no tissue damage was observed in other organs including kidney, thymus, heart and lung in these mice in response to MHV-3 infection (data not shown). These results clearly show that a deficiency of TNFR1-meditated TNF-\u03b1 signal reduced MHV-3 mediated liver and spleen damage, and thus rendered these mice resistant to MHV-3-mediated mortality.",

Thus, the successful development of a small animal model that closely resembles the key pathological findings of the human disease has significantly improved our ability to understand the pathogenesis [17]. Fortunately, a recently developed mouse FH model caused by MHV-3 infection is mainly characterized by monocyte/macrophage activation along with significantly increased production of proinflammatory mediators, and subsequent results in hepatosinusoidal thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis. This mouse FH model exhibits a syndrome that is very similar to the clinical manifestations of FH in patients and is essential for improving our understanding of the disease pathogenesis and for designing new therapeutic strategies. In the present work, we found that MHV-3 stimulated the expression of proinflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1 and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, in the infected spleens and livers, and TNF-\u03b1 induced liver tissue damage and mouse mortality by stimulating FGL2 expression and fibrinogen deposition in the infected liver. Conversely, TNFR1, rather than TNFR2, deficiency reversed these effects, as displayed by ameliorated liver damage and reduced mouse mortality. To the best of our knowledge, the present data provided the first demonstration of TNFR1signaling in the context of MHV-3 infection.",

            "text": "In inbred laboratory mice, the MHV-3 virus produces strain-dependent disease profiles that depend on the infection route, age, genetic background, and especially, the immune status of the host. Recent studies showed that FGL2 is a critical mediating factor of lethality in the MHV-3-induced FH, as demonstrated by pretreatment with neutralizing antibodies against FGL2 or interruption of its expression prevents sinusoidal fibrin deposition and hepatocellular necrosis, thereby reducing mortality in infected mice [4]. Previous work has shown that the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 was initiated by MHV-3 both in vivo and ex vivo, and high concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 promote the pathogenesis of FH [9]. However, TNF-\u03b1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts its actions via two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which are expressed in a variety of cells. TNFR1 and TNFR2 share significant homology in the extracellular domain, while their cytoplasmic regions are quite differences. TNFR1 contains a death domain in its cytoplasmic region, but this domain is absent in TNFR2. Therefore, TNFR1 can induce cell death signals [18]. As similar to other fulminant hepatitis model [19], the expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in the hepatocytes was up-regulated following MHV-3 infection. To better understand which receptor transmits the TNF-\u03b1 signal to promote FGL2 in this model, TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 and TNFR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with MHV-3. Interestingly, a lower concentration of FGL2 was observed in the TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 liver and serum than in TNFR2\u2212/\u2212 and WT littermates, suggesting that the secretion of FGL2 was regulated by signals from TNFR1 following MHV-3 infection. However, we here showed that not all of TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice resistant to MHV-3 infection and only 57% mice were survival. The morphology analysis showed that the survivors have normal liver morphology or slight liver damage, this effect was due to low FGL2 level in serum and liver tissues. Nevertheless, severe liver damage and high level of FGL2 was observed in the MHV-3 infected no-survivor of TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown), suggesting other mediators from the hosts control MHV-3 virus infection and the virus mediated FGL2 secretion.",

In this study, the relationship between the expression of TNF receptors and apoptosis of hepatocytes was investigated in mice during the early stage of MHV-3 infection.

In contrast, a significant reduction in apoptotic hepatocytes was observed in TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice together with low levels of Fas and FasL in the tissues, suggesting that the absence of TNFR1 signal could reduce Fas-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis, in addition to impeding FGL2 secretion.",

            "text": "Neutrophils are the first line of immune defense against most classes of pathogenic microorganisms. Neutrophils migrate from the bloodstream through the vascular endothelium to their target in response to inflammation [21]. At the inflammatory site, neutrophils cause necrotic tissue destruction by induced expression of a number of mediators including reactive oxygen species, complement components, and proteases as well as a variety of cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12) and chemokines (including macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2 and IL-8) [21]. The involvement of neutrophils in liver diseases, including hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury [22], endotoxemia [23], and alcoholic hepatitis [24], has been illustrated. In this model of liver injury caused by MHV-3 infection, the number of neutrophils that infiltrate into the livers and spleen was enhanced in response to MHV-3. However, their level was much lower in tissues from TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Gr-1+ neutrophils contribute to the production of proinflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and FGL2. Accumulation of neutrophils in the infected organs suggest that the neutrophils contribute to liver damage, and one of the reasons that TNFR1\u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to MHV-3-mediated FH is likely due to reduced neutrophil infiltration.",

            "text": "It is well established that Foxp3+ Tregs play a critical role in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and in the prevention of autoimmune disorders [25]. The transcription factor Foxp3 is a unique marker specific for the Treg lineage, and deletion of Foxp3 leads to lethal multi-organ autoimmune disorders in mice and humans [26]. Recently, the expression of FGL2 has been observed from Tregs and it has been proposed to have a role in Treg effector function, as demonstrated by the fact that blocking FGL2 interrupted Treg activity in vitro and decreasing MHV-3-induced mortality in vivo\n[16], [27]. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence shows that TNF-\u03b1 preferentially up-regulates TNFR2 expression on Tregs [28], and signaling through TNFR2 promotes Treg activity and proliferation [29]. Furthermore, TNFR2 is critical for the in vivo immunosuppressive function of naturally occurring Tregs [30]. To determine whether the tissue infiltration and distribution of Treg was affected by the TNFR1 signal, the number of Tregs in the spleen of infected mice were analyzed, and the results showed that the infiltration of Tregs into spleens and livers was similar among all mouse strains, suggesting that Treg infiltration into the infected organs was not regulated by TNFR signals.",
