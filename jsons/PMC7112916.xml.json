To prevent this, detection of possible contaminants through routine controls in every stage of the food supply is highly critical. In this context, all kinds of food safety issues, including those originated from physical, biological and chemical factors related to hygiene issues, as well as illegal adulterations and unauthorized additives, needs to be carefully monitored by means of highly sensitive analytical devices that are more practical than precise liquid or gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry, which are laboratory controlled, cumbersome, complex, costly and require well trained operators [1]. Among all the instrumental and manual laboratory-based analytical approaches, biosensors are the best candidates as sensitive technologies that can be substituted for traditional approaches, having better sensitivity and selectivity, especially when integrated with advances in nanotechnology and unique achievements of biotechnology.",

            "text": "Since the first introduction of the exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure in 1990, aptamers have emerged as high-affinity oligonucleotides with many unique features and have been combined with many separations and analytical devices and been employed in various areas of medical and pharmaceutical basic researches, drug development, disease diagnosis, and delivery of therapeutics [2]. High selective binding aptamers as single stranded oligonucleotides with a remarkable role in biotechnology can be either DNA or RNA based, which are isolated from a huge library of randomised oligonucleotides during consecutive cycles of incubation with the target, partitioning and amplification [3]. Aptamers have proved high potential to be replaced for antibodies in biosensor development as the biorecognition elements, because of offering several advantages over antibodies, such as better stability, simple storage, in vitro synthesis, low cost, easy modification and remarkably high affinity. Meanwhile, their smaller size makes them preferential for miniaturised systems as they can form a dense surface coverage of monolayers, which are also capable of being recycled upon breaking the aptamer-target complex, which is not normally possible with antibodies [4]. In addition, many food contaminants include substances that do not induce antibody generation, here aptamers remain to be an almost ideal option as highly selective, resistant and cost-effective option for biosensing [5]. Aptamers can recognise a vast variety of targets owing to their three-dimensional folding and adaptive conformational switching and being flexible for different modifications. Accordingly, it has gained extensive interest for food safety monitoring, and numerous aptasensors based on different transduction pathways have been designed in last decades for determination of the wide scope of biological and chemical substances. Recently, remarkable attempts have been made to improve several aspects of them, including selectivity (blended-SELEX, counter-SELEX, and negative-SELEX) and the selection time during SELEX procedure (automated-SELEX) [6].",

Nanomaterials have been incorporated in the construction of biosensors for food quality assessments commonly aiming to amplify the response signal and as the immobilisation platform for the biomolecules. Especially electrochemical biosensors, which are known to be advantageous because of low cost, easy to fabricate and being more feasible to be miniaturized, can be promoted by incorporating nanomaterials to find wide applications in food sector including food processing, storage, and distribution, in particular for food control. Food control consists of different aspects including testing safety markers, predicting shelf-life and fermentation, detecting the adulterations and process monitoring [8]. Herein, the scope of the review is confined to the recent electrochemical aptasensors that have been fabricated for determination of pathogens, additives and harmful chemicals. These substances can be generally classified into toxins, growth promoters (metabolic modulators and antibiotics), food allergens, microbial pathogens and other frequently encountered food contaminants (bisphenol, estradiol, chloramphenicol, etc.).",

Although adding non-therapeutic levels of antimicrobial growth promoters in livestock feed, which include different classes of antibiotics, have widely contributed to animal health and projected in remarkable increase in livestock production, these substances have been banned in European Union (EU) because of several evidences of pathogenic antibiotic resistance in human and ongoing public concerns on this issue [16], c).",

Also, the risk of cross-contamination during food process and storage is another issue, which dictates careful and precise determination of allergens [17], a). Allergens can be classified into IgE-mediated allergens, which can cause immediate immunologic responses through administrating allergens in oral or inhaled form, the cell-mediated allergens, which cause delayed responses, and mixed allergens (cell and IgE-mediated); each demonstrate different symptoms from digestive, respiratory and dermal to more extreme, life-threatening symptoms [17], b).

The other commonly applied techniques are potentiometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), field effect transistors (FET) and in few cases, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance [21], c). Exploiting the structural flexibility of aptamers, several sensing schemes have been designed to fulfil special analytical needs depending on the analyte type and its concentration, such as direct assay, sandwich assay, aptamer conformational switch, target molecules displacement, etc. [21], d). Common practices in developing electrochemical aptasensor assays include incorporating the electroactive substances as redox labels either by covalent or non-covalent binding into the aptamer. The aptasensors with non-covalently incorporated electroactive substances, which are denoted as label-free formats, include intercalation of the electroactive substance by electrostatic interaction with nucleic acids [21], e). As an alternative to labels, usually, a redox indicator is incorporated into the detection medium as a mediator, which undergoes redox reaction and can be traced by considering its redox peaks in the presence of different concentrations of analyte and in its absence. While labelling enables the ultrasensitive detection of a single macromolecule, it is associated with alterations in the binding affinities and conformational changes of the biomolecules and affects the kinetics of the biochemical reagents, therefore, developing label-free electrochemical aptasensors has attracted immense attention, especially the nanoparticle-modified label-free electrochemical assays [21], f). One classic approach is to design label and mediator-free sensing scheme using conductive and electrochemically active substrate, in which the change in surface characteristics, such as dielectric properties of electrode surface in FET, is directly measured and attributed to analyte concentration g), [21].",

Yang and coworkers l), [22]. reported electrochemical ractopamine (RAC) aptasensor based on gold nanoparticles/polydimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride-graphene composite (AuNPs/PDDA-GN), which employed an as highly conductive substrate for immobilization of RAC -specific aptamer. The graphene surface and gold NPs highly enhanced the electroactivity of the surface and promoted electron transfer between ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox pair (mediator). The limit of detection (LOD) as low as 5.0 \u00d7 10\u221213 mol/L for RAC. HCl was achieved according to calibration curves obtained by analysing differential pulse voltammetry assay. In a different strategy, Sheng et al. m), [22] designed ultrasensitive RAC aptasensor based on enzyme-free hairpin DNA cascade amplifier and dsDNA-templated synthesis of the CuNPs (dsDNA/CuNPs). Two non-complementary hairpins (HA1, HA2) and RAC aptamer, which was hybridized with a triggering oligonucleotide sequence, were fabricated and upon introducing RAC, the aptamer sequence was detached from the trigger, leading to HA1 hybridization with trigger and then with HA2. Consequently, the generated dsDNA structure trapped Cu in the presence of sodium ascorbate, which resulted in the CuNP formation and the highly enhanced electrical signal.",

            "text": "In a very recent report, Kesavan et al. developed an electrochemical aptasensor with GCE modified with polymelamine (p-Mel) film on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) by the potentiodynamic method and the sensor response for TC in human urine samples was analysed to evaluate the performance of aptasensor in the presence of uric acid interference. The LOQ of 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 M resulted in 50 fold excess of uric acid concentration j), [23]. The conductivity and electrochemical response of the aptasensor and sensitivity could be further improved by incorporating nanoparticles onto the electrode surface. As can be estimated, amplification of the electrode response and achieving lower detection limit without employing nanomaterials, require designing aptameric assays that are more complex with longer experimental time. In a recent paper, Taghdisi et al. n), [23] developed M-shaped electrochemical aptasensor based on TC-aptamer, 3 complementary oligonucleotides and exonuclease I (ExoI). Upon introducing the target, M-shaped structure disassembled because of the aptamer affinity toward target and its detachment from complementary sequences, followed by adding EXOl, which selectively degraded the remaining sequences allowing ferrocyanide redox probe to reach the electrode surface. The reported aptasensor demonstrated high sensitivity of 450 pM and good performance in milk and serum samples with LODs of 0.74 nM and 0.71 nM, respectively. Another exonuclease-assisted aptamer assay was reported by Yan et al. o), [23], which was the multiplex CAP and OTC assay, based on metal ion signal tags encoded by magnetic hollow porous nanoparticles (MHPs), selective aptamers of the antibiotics, complementary sequences of each aptamer (S3, S4) and exonuclease I (ExoI). In the presence of target antibiotics, aptamers were detached from complementary sequences, captured the target and later selectively degraded by EXOl, leading to target release. After adding the signal tags bearing complementary strands (S1, S2), the remained sequences (S3, S4) were hybridised by signal tags, which yielded amplified current signals that were recorded by applying SWV. There are some recent reports on applying the exonuclease-assisted targets recycling amplification strategy in electrochemical aptasensors for ultrasensitive detection of other types of antibiotics, such as ampicillin p), [23], oxytetracycline and kanamycin q), [23].",

Lysozyme is an abundant enzyme found in body fluids of mammals (0.5\u20132.0 mg/ml at blood) and also egg white (3.5%), which plays a natural antibacterial role by degrading glycoprotein wall of gram-positive bacteria through catalyzing the cleavage of its acetal group [25], d), e). LYS has application in food industry as a preservative, in food packaging to inhibit microbial growth [25], f) and in the production process of foodstuffs, such as ripened cheese g), [25]. Rohrbach and coworkers h), [25] reported label-free impedimetric LYS aptasensor based on multi-walled carbon nanotube-modified screen-printed electrodes (MWCNT-SPEs) as substrate. LYS-aptamer modified with amine groups readily reacted with \u2014COOH functional groups of carbon nanotubes and stabilized on the electrode surface. The impedimetric measurements proved an increase in average resistance RCT value after immobilization of aptamer on the modified electrode, because of repulsion between the aptamer baring negative charge and the anionic ferro/ferricyanide redox mediator. Later, the RCT relatively decreased upon introducing LYS and its interaction with the aptamer leading to the access of redox mediator to the electrode surface and subsequent charge transfer.",

The aptamer hybridised after adding LYS, bonded to LYS and totally detached from the surface, which led to a considerable decrease in electron resistance in presence of redox mediator. The designed duplex scheme demonstrated better sensitivity with LOD of 0.07 nM compared to the previous scheme with 862 nM, despite providing more electroactive and conductive nanomaterial-based substrate. Similarly, Xia et al. designed aptasensor based on the target-binding-induced conformational change of aptamer-complementary DNA (cDNA) and investigated the impact of preparation method and density of the applied complementary DNA on the sensitivity of quantification by SWV. They suggested that single step preparation of the three-way junction structure generated by a ferrocene (Fc)-tagged cDNA bearing bulge abutted with 5 \u03bcM anti-LYS aptamer concentration provided better discrimination between currents attributed to signal on and signal off states, compared with step-wise procedures and 2 \u03bcM cDNA j), [25].",

            "text": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) the prominent mycotoxin is the most widely studied toxin by means of electrochemical aptasensors. It is present in a wide variety of food products and may pose several health threatening toxic effects, such as nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, neurotoxic, teratogenic and immunotoxic activities [26], a). Mishra et al. developed a competitive aptasensing assay for determination of OTA in cocoa samples. The aptamer immobilised on the SPE through 4-carboxyphenyl diazonium activated with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyle)-N-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and incubated with free OTA and biotin-labeled OTA to generate competitive binding followed by introducing avidin-ALP as signal generating agent to form avidin-biotin binding. The dephosphorylation of 1-naphthyl phosphate (1-NP), a substrate for ALP, and its oxidation to 1-iminoquinone and related DPV curves was observed [26], b). A previously developed impedimetric aptasensor for determination of OTA in cocoa based on SPE with similar surface modification and with direct OTA aptasensing assay had exhibited rather lower sensitivity with LOD of 0.15 ng/mL compared to 0.06 ng/mL LOD for the competitive voltammetric aptasensor [26], c). Tong et al. reported the first OTA electrochemical aptasensor based on exonuclease-assisted target recycling amplification strategy, which was successfully applied on wheat starch samples and yielded low detection limit of 1.0 pg/mL [26], d). Aiming to determine OTA levels in corn samples, Tan et al. [26], e) developed exonuclease-catalyzed target recycling aptamer assay based on repulsive electrostatic forces between negatively-charged ITO sensor surface and the methylene blue (MB)-tagged ssDNA-OTA aptamer duplex in the absence of OTA, and electron transfer after introducing OTA. The dissociation of aptamer occurred in presence of target and upon adding exonuclease, the degraded OTA aptamer and MB-tagged DNA, resulted in less negatively charged pieces, which initiated the electron transfer. Similar exonuclease assisted amplification strategy was employed in a recent study by designing a hairpin structure consisted of OTA-aptamer, extended DNA and the complementary sequence of the aptamer. The signal off state because of MB-tagged ssDNA in the proximity of ITO turned to signal on after incubating hairpin probe with OTA and applying the complex on the electrode surface followed by adding exonuclease [26], f). Other oligonucleotide-based amplification strategies, such as rolling chain amplification (RCA), have also been applied for sensitive detection of OTA in food samples g), h), [26]. Several label-free impedimetric OTA aptasensor schemes have been designed in recent years. For instance, Evtugyn et al. i), [26] immobilised thiol-modified OTA aptamers on Ag nanoparticles, which were decorated on the gold surface. The quantification was based on the conformational switch of the aptamer to G-quadruplex due to OTA-aptamer complex formation that led to the decrease in capacitance because of forming nonconductive structure and increase in charge transfer resistance because of surface compactness, which was measured in the presence of ferricyanide redox marker. The very similar sensor was developed by immobilising thiolated OTA aptamer on AuNPs suspended on the electrode surface and detection was performed based on increased resistance upon the binding event and conformational switch of the aptamer from linear to G-quadruplex structure j), [26]. Rivas et al. k), [26] developed OTA sensing substrate by incorporating IrO2 NPs as redox active agent and electropolymerized polythionine. In order to enable aptamer immobilisation, the electrostatic interactions between negatively charged citrate groups surrounding IrO2 nanoparticles and cationic amine-modified aptamer were used. The Rct value increased after immobilising aptamer because of the repulsions between negatively charged phosphate backbone of aptamers and anionic redox indicator. Later, introducing OTA remarkably increased the RCT due to anionic species formed by the ionisation of the phenolic and carboxylic groups in the OTA molecule, which added to the negative charge on the electrode surface (see Fig. 2\n).",

The potentiometric system consisted of working and reference electrode used to monitor the electromotive force (EMF) responses upon adding increasing concentrations of E. coli in standard samples as well as real samples, such as milk and apple juice spiked with the bacteria [18], a). Luo and coworkers explored target-induced aptamer displacement strategy and developed E. coli O111 electrochemical aptasensor. After introducing target, the aptamer was detached from its complementary capture probe and later, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase-tagged detection probe was added, which hybridised with the capture probe introducing analytical signals that were monitored by DPV. The performance of the aptasensor was tested in spiked milk and LOD of 305 CFU mL\u22121 was achieved, which was reported to be lower than 105 CFU mL\u22121 obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [28], f). Another study for detection of E. coli was proposed based on developing selective aptamers toward proteins expressed on the outer membrane of E. coli. The impedimetric aptasensor demonstrated high sensitivity in the range of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127\u20132 \u00d7 10\u22126 M and performed satisfactorily in water samples even in the presence of other contaminants g), [28].",

Several aptamers have been isolated for determination of S. aureus as whole bacteria, using cell-SELEX procedure or aptamers sensitive toward epitopes expressed on the surface of S. aureus and its toxins s), [28]. In an interesting study, Abbaspour et al. developed dual-aptamer-based sandwich assay against S. aureus by employing two aptamers, the first aptamer immobilised on magnetic beads and the second aptamer bearing AgNps as redox tag. After introducing the target and the generation of aptamer-S. aureus\u2013aptamer-AgNps complex, AgNps were dissolved in acidic medium and measured by differential pulse stripping voltammetry technique t), [28]. Jia et al. u), [28] developed impedimetric aptasensor by modifying GCE surface with RGO and gold nanoparticles. The layer by layer assembly of rGO-ssDNA-AuNP was obtained followed by immobilising the aptamer on the surface of AunNPs (GCE/rGO-ssDNA-AuNP/aptamer). The ability of aptasensor for detecting S. aureus in real samples, fish extract and water, was demonstrated and the aptasensor could sensitively quantify bacteria in standard samples with LOD as low as 10 CFU mL\u22121\n. Another graphene-based S. aureus aptasensor was developed using potentiometric transduction, which was capable of discriminating live bacteria. Two GCEs were employed, one was modified with graphene oxide (GO) and the other with RGO to compare the responses of each substrate based on EMF changes when aptamers immobilised on GO/RGO interact with different concentrations of S. aureus. The EMF-time plot depicted for two approaches showed better reproducibility despite high noise levels for GO, which stabilised aptamers through covalent binding compared to RGO, which immobilised aptamers via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions and offered lower detection limits. The reduction step for converting GO to RGO through hydrazine was defined as the reason for poor reproducibility of the RGO substrate v), [28].

Accordingly, the early exposure of the contaminants in infants by plastic toys and feeding utensils, during development is of high concern [29], a). The underlying reason for the endocrine disruption effects of BPA is its structure, which is analogue with endocrine hormones, estradiol and diethylstilbestrol, and capable of binding to oestrogen receptors [29], b). Recently, there have been increasing studies of BPA with electrochemical aptasensors. Deiminiat et al. developed multiwall carbon nanotubes/gold nanoparticles (f-MWCNTs/AuNPs) nanocomposite film as an electroactive layer on GE surface and as a substrate to immobilised thiolated BPA specific aptamer. The standard and real samples (such as mineral water, orange juice and milk) were studied by the proposed aptasensor with SWV technique and in the presence of ferrocene indicator [29], c). Some other direct electrochemical BPA aptasensing assays have been conducted by using electrode modification with the nanomaterial films, such as gold nanoparticles dotted graphene (GNPs/GR) nanocomposite film as a substrate on GCE [29], d) and nanoporous gold film prepared with dealloying Ag from Au/Ag alloy leaves in concentrated nitric casted physically on GCE [29], e). In a recent study, Kazane et al. [29], f) synthesised an anti-BPA aptamer modified with pentahistidine peptide in its 5\u2032-terminal. The histidine tag was applied to immobilised the aptamer via noncovalent bonding on the polypyrrole modification of the electrode surface, which provided a close contact in molecular level with the electrode surface.

First, the thiolated ferrocene (Fc)-modified BPA aptamer was immobilised on GE and hybridized with the methylene blue (MB)-tagged complementary DNA probe (MB-P). Upon introducing BPA, the MB-P was released, leading to decline in the MB signal and increase in FC signal because of the conformational switch of the aptamer after capturing BPA and getting closer to the electrode surface. Accordingly, the oxidation peak of BPA was observed as the third signalling pathway (see Fig. 4\n) g), [29]. The label-free impedimetric BPA aptasensors based on a simple scheme of immobilising aptamer and complementary probe on GE was reported. The aptasensor was tested for its performance in spiked drinking samples and LOD of 0.284 ppt was obtained in less than half an hour for standards hence, the aptasensor revealed a high potential for highly sensitive on-site detection of BPA in real samples h), [29].",

After some successfully commercialised electrochemical aptasensors for determination of food allergens, the hopes for employing this powerful analytical platform for determination of other health-affecting food contaminants are considerably raised. In this review, we attempted to attract the attention towards serious health hazards of the contaminants and highlight recent trends and novel studies for detecting these substances by electrochemical aptasensors. The combination of nanomaterials has been incorporated as the most preferred electrode modifications for providing high surface area for probe immobilisation and amplification of the signal response because of their excellent electrical conductivity. Toxins and antibiotics are by far the most widely analysed contaminants by several electrochemical aptasensors and detecting pathogenic bacterial contaminants and chemical phenolic substances are the next growing target areas.",

The same applies to other foodborne allergens namely, the milk allergen and lupin. The genetic manipulation of the food products is the other recent area of concern and should be addressed to prevent health consequences and fulfil the expectations of consumers, which are getting more aware of their rights for consuming healthier and organic food products. Meanwhile, the intensive studies should be focused toward developing highly efficient aptamers with sensitive electrochemical platforms for determination of any hormonal growth promoting agents along with chemicals that simulate the actions of hormones in the human body by competing for the same receptors. The other critical issue of food products is ethical aspects and its implication for different populations, such as Halal issue. The possible adulteration of the meat supplied from cattle origin with unauthorised species, such as porcine meat needs to be identified by analysing the relevant biomarkers (protein-based or DNA strand) through sensitive electrochemical aptasensors.",
