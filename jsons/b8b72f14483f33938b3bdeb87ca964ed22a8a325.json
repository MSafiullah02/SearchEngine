Similar tools were quickly 142 implemented in Seattle to help local government track the spread of the virus. Jefferson Health's 143 telemedicine system successfully used chatbots to triage patients without the need for in-person 144 care. The University of California San Francisco designed and deployed an employee screening 145 chatbot that decreased hospital entrance times from 30 minutes to less than one minute. There 146 are many companies currently offering chatbot services to manage everything from patient 147 scheduling to collecting patient reported outcomes. The success of chatbots during the COVID-148 19 response and the fact that many are now active and integrated into numerous healthcare 149 system's informatics infrastructure, suggests that their use will expand following the resolution of 150 the pandemic. 151 Virtual Physical Therapy and Telerehabilitation 153 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the need for \"social distancing,\" avoiding in 154 person contact and crowded, enclosed places. The traditional care model for recovery after hip 155 and knee replacement involves intensive in-home physical therapy (PT) and/or in-person 156 outpatient therapy. The need to maintain \"social distancing\" coupled with the previously 157 mentioned payment reforms have led to a surge in the availability of both telehealth physical 158 therapy options from PT providers as well as virtual PT delivered by avatars. For many patients, 159 both of these options provide customized PT in the comfort of a patient's home at a lower cost, 160 thus establishing a more adaptable and equally effective PT pathway compared to traditional in-161 person PT. 162 Bettger et al performed a prospective, randomized trial of an avatar-based virtual PT 163 program for patients after unilateral TKA and compared clinical and economic outcomes for their 164 patients. They found that compared to traditional in-home or clinic-based PT, avatar-based 165 virtual PT significantly decreased 3-month associated health related costs while providing 166 equivalent clinical outcomes. They stressed the importance of appropriate clinical oversight of 167 any truly virtual PT program to ensure patients progress appropriately. This oversight can be 168 provided by a physical therapist, physician, or physician extender [4]. 169 Fisher et al described a Physical Therapist-based telehealth navigation platform that 170included not only telehealth visits with a live physical therapist, but also care navigation with a 171 nurse practitioner that was available to perform real-time assessments in the postoperative 172 period after joint replacement. They noted a significant cost savings associated with this them[6]. For those with expertise in data science, the COVID-19 pandemic has been nothing 183 short of humbling. Three anecdotes that bring important data-related learnings to light are listed 184 below. 185First, COVID-19 has shown that data quality is of supreme importance in the context of Second, \"flattening the curve\" is a text-book example of how a data-driven approach 197 from epidemiology can be successfully implemented and translated into effective policies that 198 not only change behavior but, when heeded, can save thousands of lives. Flattening the curve 199 means spreading out new cases over time so that the health system is not overwhelmed. and 200 the affected population buys time to ramp up testing and develop vaccines and treatments. 201",

The utility of these software applications is in 338 channeling and engaging a patient's skills, desires, and knowledge to promote positive health 339 outcomes [24]. 340 Patient engagement increases a patient's willingness to participate in care, and is 341 associated with improved patient interactions, decreased cost, emergency visits, and 342 hospitalization [24-26]. PEPs have been utilized to facilitate care in various aspects of medicine, 343 including smoking cessation and diabetes management [27-28]. The potential for PEPs in 344 orthopaedics to expand during and after the current pandemic is high. Patients whose elective 345 surgeries were postponed are likely to experience an extended period of non-operative 346 management. PEPs can provide educational resources and targeting at-home therapeutic 347 alternatives proactively updating patients regarding changes in clinic services, surgical 348 schedules, or COVID-19 related policies. PEPs have been shown to provide a meaningful 349 connection between the patients and the provider's team [29-30], have demonstrated utility in 350 collecting patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), and save time for providers during PEPs provide a convenient modality for rapid wound assessment through image sharing 353 and expedite the modification of treatment plans for concerning wounds [29-30]. 354 With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, practices with PEPs already deployed were able 355 to use them to quickly and efficiently deploy alternate treatment pathways for patients whose 356 surgery was cancelled or pending. Other systems enrolled the patients retroactively and used 357 the platforms to rapidly share information and answer questions to patients stranded at home. 358 3D printing technologies 359 360 As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States, it became evident that 361 areas affected by an outbreak of coronavirus would stress the supply chains for many devices 362 and tools required for a functioning healthcare system. Government regulators endorsed 363 strategies for conservation of limited resources and the FDA relaxed import restrictions to allow 364 equipment not approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to 365 be used in healthcare settings [33]. 366 367 Across the globe, engineers and hobbyists with access to additive manufacturing 368 platforms (\"3D printers\") rushed forward with innovative solutions to help mitigate some of the 369 equipment shortfalls. Designs for the manufacture of masks, face shields and ventilator splitters 370 were made available online through the National Institute of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange 371 [34]. Many community projects worked to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to front 372 line healthcare and other essential workers without adequate access to PPE. These grassroots 373 volunteer campaigns organized to manufacture masks and face shields in their homes or 374 businesses and distributed them widely at no cost in settings ranging from grocery stores to 375 large hospital systems [35]. Additive manufacturing has also been utilized to produce other 376 complex components during this crisis. When the original supplier for a connector valve for a 377 ventilator in use at an Italian hospital was unable to meet the sudden increase in demand, a 378 local engineering firm was able to produce 100 of the components utilizing 3D printers within 24 379 hours [36]. A multidisciplinary team is testing a novel design for a ventilator splitter that may 380 allow paired patients to be ventilated by one machine [37]. 381 382 Additive manufacturing has been utilized in the last decade by the orthopaedic implant 383 industry to manufacture implantable components fundamentally altering the engineering and 384 manufacturing constraints for these devices [38]. The COVID-19 crisis has increased 385awareness of the potential to use this manufacturing technology in orthopaedics.",
