            "text": "The importance of community acquired respiratory virus (CRV) infections is increasingly recognised. CRV are responsible for respiratory infections, which usually present as a common cold in the immunocompetent individual but may be life-threatening in the immunocompromised host. Usually, orthomyxoviridae (influenza A, B and C), paramyxoviridae (including parainfluenza 1\u20134 [PIV], respiratory syncytial virus A and B [RSV], and human metapneumovirus [hMPV]), coronaviridae, picornaviridae (including >100 different serotypes of rhinovirus and enterovirus), adenoviridae, polyomavirus type 1 and bocavirus are regarded as potential causes of CRV infection. This guideline is intended to give haematologists and oncologists a broad overview with regard to clinical relevance and diagnosis of CRV infection and management of cancer patients affected by CRV. Detailed information on respective viruses including emerging resistance is not the scope of this guideline. Most data on this topic originate from patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), and we know little about CRV infections in cancer patients outside the setting of allo-SCT. However, in recent years increasing evidence has been gathered about other cancer patients, revealing clinical relevance of CRV infections in non-transplant patients. Therefore, this guideline discusses CRV infections in all cancer patients with ongoing relevant immunosuppression. It is left to the treating physician to assess the degree and relevance of immunosuppression in the individual patient.",

First, predefined topics were delivered by the designated coordinator (MvLT) to all participants of the panel to form subgroups. Data were extracted and tabulated after a systematic literature search by subgroup members and revised in several steps by the members of the panel on the basis of an email-based discussion process and a face-to-face meeting. Finally, preliminary recommendations of the panel were discussed, revised and approved by the AGIHO assembly.",

This search was performed for adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, hMPV, influenza, PIV, parechovirus, RSV and rhinovirus. The references were then screened by the subgroup members and relevant articles retrieved as full papers. Wherever applicable, additional papers were identified in the reference lists and treated as described. In February 2016, an update of the literature search was performed.",

The results of the literature search and the following grading process were used to develop recommendations wherever possible. Recommendations and evidence were then presented at and approved by the AGIHO assembly during the spring meeting on 6th March 2015. Following the update of the literature search in February 2016 no relevant changes were made.",

Commonly, URTI can be assumed, if a patient has a new onset of symptoms including at least one of cough, coryza, sore throat or shortness of breath which is deemed to be due to an infection by the treating physician. LRTI requires clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia [2]. ILI is diagnosed in patients with a sudden onset of new symptoms including at least one of fever or feverishness, malaise, headache or myalgia and at least one of the respiratory symptoms cough, sore throat or shortness of breath [3]. To be certain of the viral origin, the detection of the virus from respiratory samples like swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is required. Of note, surveillance studies showed some patients to be asymptomatic but still shedding the virus [2], [4], [5], [6], [7]. For that reason, some authors distinguish between respiratory infection (detection of virus independent of symptoms) and respiratory infection disease (detection of virus and respective symptoms) [8]. However, for the purpose of this guideline, we omit this distinction and define URTI, LRTI and ILI as described above.",

            "text": "Generally, viral URTI in cancer patients has some impact on the clinical course because the patients are symptomatic to a degree that frequently requires postponement of chemotherapy [17]. However, critical illness and mortality due to viral URTI are rare. In contrast, most patients who died were suffering from LRTI, which thus poses the biggest threat to cancer patients. Rates of LRTI and mortality differ amongst the respective CRV [18] and exact estimation is hampered by the fact that fatal cases are probably over-reported. We have tried to deduce reliable information on LRTI and mortality from the literature for various CRV: influenza appears to have a high rate of LRTI with approximately 30% and an associated mortality rate of approximately 25% [19], [20], [21], [22]. RSV appears to be at least as dangerous with a rate of LRTI of approximately 33% and an associated mortality rate of 27% [16]. However, it has to be kept in mind, that most data regarding RSV originate from SCT-recipients and very little is known regarding patients with other forms of malignancy. On the other hand, there are several reports of outbreaks in general haematology/oncology units, which showed a significant disease burden even in patients not undergoing stem cell transplantation [12].",

In contrast, despite case reports of fatal outcomes of infections with rhinovirus and coronavirus, these viruses as well as bocavirus appear to be rarely the cause of LRTI and dangerous only when patients are coinfected with other pathogens [2], [5], [29]. Herpesviridae like herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus 6, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster and Epstein\u2013Barr virus as well as polyomaviruses or parechoviruses usually do not cause CRV infection.

As a general rule, a close collaboration with the local microbiology laboratory is highly recommended because this may determine which material should be used preferably since commercially available test kits are licensed for specific materials. For example testing for viral antigens usually requires more thorough sampling like combined nasal/throat swabs than testing for viral nucleic acids which can often be performed reliably on gargles alone. It is therefore essential for the clinician to be aware of the tests used in the respective laboratory. The overall evidence in the literature is best for combined nasal/throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates (A IIt, Table 2).",

Also, culture methods are not commonly used anymore and cannot be recommended for general diagnosis, but they are essential in individual cases in which no known virus can be detected or results of PCR-analysis are inconclusive (A II, [43]). In the era of multiplex-test kits, it is difficult to make a definite recommendation with regard to which viruses should be looked for. In the absence of any reliable data regarding this question, the panel feels that it is wise to search for influenza, RSV, PIV and viruses currently prevalent in the local environment in all immunosuppressed cancer patients presenting with symptoms. Patients with more severe disease (for example pneumonia or critical illness) may have the panel broadened to include hMPV and adenovirus and even viruses that only rarely cause LRTI like rhinovirus and coronavirus. However, evidence for this approach is low and it is strongly advisable to define local guidelines on this topic. It should be kept in mind, that herpesviridae are not the cause of CRV infection. Therefore, there is no rationale to look for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster in patients with typical symptoms of CRV infection only.",

            "text": "In patients with symptoms of LRTI, it is essential to determine the degree of pulmonary involvement. CRV can affect the tracheobronchial system or the lung parenchyma [44]. Generally, a chest X-ray has been proven to be unhelpful to diagnose pathologic changes in this setting because of lack of sensitivity. It is therefore not recommended (D II, see Table 2). In contrast, there is good evidence to recommend a CT scan of the chest to detect LRTI in patients with CRV infection (A II, see Table 2). Bronchial wall thickening as well as interstitial infiltrates presenting as ground-glass opacities may be detected. These are defined as increased lung density, whereas underlying lung architecture is still detectable. Ground-glass opacities may be patchy or diffuse [44], [45], [46], [47] and can be well distinguished from consolidations, which show higher density obscuring e.g. the pulmonary vessels and which are typical for other differential diagnoses including bacterial infection. Affection of the terminal bronchioles might lead to visibility of those usually invisible structures at CT as small centrilobular nodules or \u2018tree-in-bud\u2019 sign [45] or evidence of bronchiolitis causing air-trapping. To reliably detect air-trapping while inspiratory CT is normal, a CT scan in expiration is necessary [44]. In addition to good diagnostic accuracy with regard to the diagnosis of a viral LRTI, the CT scan may also reveal evidence for an outbreak, since specific viruses tend to present with a typical pattern in the CT scan [45]. For an example see Fig. 1\n.",

It is therefore wise to perform follow-up testing of respiratory material in index patients and stop contact isolation only when they became negative.

The situation is less clear for patients with less aggressive treatment, since there have been reports of uneventful courses of even high-dose chemotherapy in patients with initial CRV infection [61]. Therefore, the recommendation to delay the chemotherapy if possible to be on the safe side is merely a weak one (Table 3). Similarly, reducing immunosuppression in patients with LRTI due to adenovirus-infection after allo-SCT is well founded [36], [62] on retrospective cohort studies with 2 groups and is thus clearly recommended (A II, Table 3). Data can be transferred to the situation of other LRTI caused by CRV, therefore, reduction of immunosuppression is also recommended in allo-SCT recipients with LRTI caused by other CRV (A IIt, Table 3). In contrast, the situation is less clear in patients with URTI and therefore only a very weak recommendation can be made (C III, Table 3).",

In contrast, despite ongoing discussion regarding the balance of efficacy and side effects [67], [68] the treatment of choice appears to be a neuraminidase inhibitor, be it oseltamivir, zanamivir or peramivir. They are recommended as prophylaxis as well as for treatment (for example http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/I/Influenza/IPV/IPV_Node.html or [63], [69], [70]). However, data regarding the efficacy of prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors in cancer patients are very weak and almost exclusively in the setting of stem cell transplantation [71], [72]. Therefore, the authors believe it is not justified to give any recommendation in favour of or against their use in cancer patients in general. Thus, prevention of influenza by application of neuraminidase inhibitors remains one of the unresolved issues requiring further study.

Cancer patients might be regarded as high-risk patients per se, which is why neuraminidase inhibitors (usually oseltamivir) are often routinely given to patients with malignancies and influenza [69], [70], [73], since mostly retrospective data show a benefit of (early) antiviral treatment with regard to development of LRTI or further complications [10], [20], [74], [75], [76]. Thus, we do recommend the use of oseltamivir or zanamivir (B II, Table 4, Table 5). There is evidence to recommend early initiation of treatment, but that does not necessarily mean later treatment is futile [77] and therefore many authors recommend treatment regardless of timepoint [70]. However, we do not think either dose (150\u2013300 mg/d) nor duration (5\u201310 d or longer) are well defined from the available evidence and need determination by local specialists. The reasons usually given for higher doses and longer treatment duration in high-risk patients is the prolonged viral shedding observed in cancer patients and a thus deduced susceptibility to develop resistances if not treated effectively [69], [70].",

Most available data concern allo-SCT recipients [80], but recent evidence also suggests a benefit in less severely immunosuppressed cancer patients [12], [81]. It appears to lower the progression rate to LRTI [82] and is reported to have a positive influence on survival [12]. However, some authors report favourable outcome of RSV infections without any causal treatment [61], [83], [84]. Traditionally, it is used as an aerosol (see Table 5), but this application mode is cumbersome and may be associated with a teratogeneic effect [85]. Also, patients may not be able to inhale for such a long time or they may react with bronchospasm. Thus, oral application has been used increasingly with a similar efficacy [12], [30], [81], [86], [87] and even intravenous application is reported [87]. Despite some reports with a good outcome without treatment, we believe the available evidence justifies a recommendation for the use of ribavirin in cancer patients with RSV infection (B II, Table 4). Also, at least in high-risk patients the treatment should be given at the stage of URTI, since this has shown a benefit (B II [82]).",
