Several viruses, from variable families, cause upper respiratory infections which, although generally underestimated due to their typically self-limiting nature, underlie enormous healthcare resource utilization and financial burden. Such, otherwise \"benign\" infections, can have very significant sequelae both in the form of bringing about local complications but also inducing asthma attacks, thus greatly increasing morbidity. Their enormous prevalence also indicates that rigorous research should be undertaken in order to tackle them, in both the prevention and treatment field.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The upper respiratory tract is the site of infection for several viral and bacterial pathogens. The term \"upper respiratory tract infection\" (URTI) encompasses a number of conditions that have a variable and diverse range of presentations, due to the number of adjacent anatomical sites involved, causative organisms and several host and environmental factors. \"URTI\" is therefore a nonspecific term used to describe acute infections involving the upper respiratory tract (nose, paranasal sinuses, ear, pharynx, and larynx) ( Fig. 1.1 ). It is, however, rather imprecise as it incorrectly implies an absence of lower respiratory tract pathology, when clearly such pathology may often co-exist with upper respiratory tract disease [1] . Acute URTIs are an important part of general practice visits: A national study suggested that they comprise roughly 10% of all GP consultations [2] . Viral URTIs cause considerable financial burden, also in association to their comorbidities [3] . Often regarded as trivial, URTIs do not receive the attention they merit if their enormous incidence, morbidity and occasionally serious sequelae are taken into consideration [4] . Most URTIs have viral origin, with human rhinoviruses (RV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza being the main culprits (Table 1.1) [5] . Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been recently identified in samples from RSV-negative children with bronchiolitis [6] , while human bocavirus (BoV) was discovered by large-scale molecular virus screening of pooled respiratory tract samples [7] . The importance of each viral agent in early life is not clear but RSV, RV, PIV, and influenza virus are predominant in the literature. However, several factors limit our understanding regarding the relative importance of each pathogen, including differences in study design (e.g. PCR versus immunoassay or other detection methods [8] ), in recruitment criteria, and in the investigated viruses (e.g. RSV has been considerably easier to detect in-vitro, as compared to RV). Transmission of viruses causing URTIs occurs by dispersal of small-particle aerosols (droplets), large-particle aerosols that are briefly suspended in air, and by direct contact with infectious secretions on skin/environmental surfaces (e.g. direct hand-to-hand contact), with subsequent passage to the nares or eyes [9] . Hence, transmission occurs easier in crowded spaces. However, transmission dynamics are not identical between different viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 730, "end": 733, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 880, "end": 883, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 978, "end": 981, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1162, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1409, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1530, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1653, "end": 1656, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 1992, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2452, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 534, "text": "Fig. 1.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Respiratory viruses are genetically and antigenically distinct.

Historically, enteroviruses (EVs) and RVs were classified into separate genera, but due to their related genome structure they were merged into a single genus, the enteroviruses, which include three RV species (RV-A to RV-C) and four non-RV EV species (EV-A to EV-D) [3] (Fig. 1.2) . These viruses have different phenotypic characteristics, with RVs mainly being restricted to the respiratory system, whereas EVs cause diverse multisystem clinical manifestations (e.g. myopericarditis, encephalitis, and quite often viral meningitis [16] ). However, some EVs cause RV-like respiratory symptoms (respiratory EVs, e.g. species C and D). RVs and EVs are small, non-enveloped, RNA viruses with a genome of about 7.2-7.5 kb packed in a 30 nm icosahedric capsid which, in turn, is composed of 12 pentamers, each composed of 5 protomers. The protomers contain four capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 [17] . The major group of RVs which includes RV-A and RV-B, typically needs intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 as a receptor, whereas the minor group needs low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) [18] ; RV-C uses a different receptor (cadherin-related family member 3-CDHR3) [19] . Regarding recognition by the innate immune system, after ssRNA internalization the genome is recognized by endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and TLR8 [20] . Once double-stranded RNA is generated, the type I interferon (IFN) response ensues leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, including RANTES, inducible protein (IP)-10, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 [21, 22] . The latter (IL-8), is a potent neutrophil chemotactic/activation agent, and is an important determinant of the clinical outcome of RV infection. IL-8 production has been shown after RV infection in both upper and lower airway epithelial cells [23] . An antibody response to RV infection occurs after viral clearance, with the development of neutralizing serum antibodies (IgG) and secretory antibodies (IgA) in the respiratory tract. These are detectable 1-2 weeks after infection and maintained for at least 1 year [24] , protecting from [25] . Although this humoral response appears to offer some cross-serotype protection [26] , we have shown that, generally, protection is sub-optimal [27] . As opposed to influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, RV is rarely associated with significant cytopathology of the upper respiratory tract. The structure of the epithelial cell (EC) lining usually remains intact, and viral shedding is relatively limited when considering the severity of the symptoms [28] . However RVs do disrupt the function of the epithelium, facilitating exposure of epithelial cells to bacteria, allergens and irritants [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 87, "end": 91, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 201, "end": 205, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 475, "end": 478, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1312, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1391, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1550, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1768, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1772, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2022, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2295, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2314, "end": 2318, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2404, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2468, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2785, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2922, "end": 2926, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 479, "end": 489, "text": "(Fig. 1.2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Human Rhinovirus"}, {"text": "Children are considered as the major reservoir for RVs and could experience up to 12 common cold infections per year [30] .

However, we have shown that RV can replicate in lower airway epithelial cells [29] , and that the difference in replication capacity at higher temperatures is minimal [37] . This was shown for eight different RV strains whose titers at 37 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F) were significantly higher than those required to initiate infection [37] . This provided conclusive evidence to the infectionrelated mechanism underlying the epidemiological link between common colds and asthma exacerbations. Up to two-thirds of virus-induced asthma attacks are due to RV, probably as a result of local and systemic immune responses. Local cytopathology in bronchial epithelial cells can only be observed after the use of high viral inocula [29] , suggesting a potential dose-response relationship, to which patients with asthma may be particularly susceptible. It is now well recognized that RV is not a strictly upper respiratory pathogen [38] , but is in fact one of the most powerful early factors associated with asthma throughout childhood [39] . The dynamics of RV infection are affected in atopic individuals, although it is still not clear to what extent there is increased susceptibility to the virus and/or a differential response to it.

Although normal steady-state viral presence-rather than infection-cannot be excluded for some of these cases, it was shown that 60-80% of children presenting with asthma exacerbations were positive for viral genetic material versus only 10-40% of healthy controls [43, 44] .

Both methods are onerous and slow to produce results, therefore, they are not used in routine clinical work, but do have a role in an epidemiological context [1] . Antigen detection by antigen specific monoclonal antibodies is the basis of a variety of rapid diagnostic tests. However, they demonstrate relatively low sensitivity in adults, where the viral load may be low [78] . Nucleic acid-based tests are increasingly being used and they have opened new avenues in research, especially for RV for which other methods were suboptimal [79] . Also, they are now being multiplexed, allowing the rapid concurrent detection of many viruses including RV, influenza virus, adenovirus, RSV, human metapneumovirus and PIV [8, [80] [81] [82] . Several rapid antigen tests have also been developed for certain viruses such as IFV [83] , and RSV [84] . There are recommendations regarding the use of such tests, especially for influenza, where WHO has produced specific guidelines based on various criteria; e.g. for institutional outbreaks, for travelers, and when surveillance systems indicate that influenza is circulating in the community (\"WHO recommendations on the use of rapid testing for influenza diagnosis\"). URTIs are not an indication for the use of rapid antigen test in the clinic. Diagnostic tests for viral URTIs are generally not recommended in routine clinical practice unless there are special circumstances (e.g. complications, differential diagnosis issues, immunocompromised individuals etc.). We are currently developing a new chip to detect antibody responses to different RV subtypes in the context of the \"PREDICTA\" EU project. Such a tool may be able to be used for URTIs in the future. Although the role of radiologic studies in viral URTIs is limited, potential intracranial sequalae should be evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 138, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 609, "end": 612, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 824, "end": 828, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 988, "end": 992, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1170, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1180, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1185, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1292, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnosis"}, {"text": "Currently, the only drugs for respiratory viruses used in everyday practice are for influenza, and only for lower respiratory infection.

Bacterial tracheitis, or pseudomembranous croup, is another condition characterized by bacterial inflammation. The tracheal mucosa is infected by Staphyloccocus aureus, streptococci or Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) and the patient appears toxic with a high fever and progressive upper airway obstruction [135] .
