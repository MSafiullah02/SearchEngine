            "text": "Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), a Pneumovirus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, is a respiratory pathogen of cattle that causes economical losses to beef and dairy production. The infection consists as a part of a disease complex in calves (Stott et al., 1980), but it also occurs as outbreaks in na\u00efve populations and may be fatal in adults (Elvander, 1996, Inaba et al., 1972). BRSV has enveloped virions; it possesses a negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome and exists as a single serotype. Genomic phylogenetic studies have divided isolates into six subgroups with the highest average percentage of sequence divergence in the glycoprotein (G) coding region of the genome (Valarcher et al., 2000). The fusion (F) protein coding region is less variable and is therefore a more suitable target for the design of diagnostic tests (Eleraky et al., 2003).",

The period of virus shedding from the point when clinical signs appear is short in infected animals; the virus is labile and therefore difficult to isolate in cell culture (Valarcher et al., 1999, West et al., 1998). BRSV-specific antibodies in clinical specimens may interfere with virus isolation (VI) and also with direct detection methods based on serological techniques (West et al., 1998). Furthermore, the usage of indirect detection by serology (BRSV-specific IgG detection) is hampered by the suppressive effect of maternal antibodies on the humoral response to infection (Kimman et al., 1987).",

Total RNA was extracted from each dilution and was analysed by fRT-PCR (two replicates of each dilution, from 10 to 109) and in parallel by nested PCR (Vilcek et al., 1994). The experiment was repeated with both assays. The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated by testing nine BRSV strains originating from the Netherlands (37 NL, 1974), Hungary (908/8 H, 1975), Sweden (271 SW, 4556 SW, 187 SW, 504 SW, 1992\u20131995) and Denmark (195 DK, 1988; 4899 DK, 1993; 2020 DK, 1994), nasal swabs from 14 healthy calves and 8 virus species, genetically or symptomatically related to BRSV. The viruses included bovine coronavirus (n\n = 3), parainfluenza-3 virus (n\n = 7), bovine viral diarrhoea virus, type 1 (BVDV-1; n\n = 2), border disease virus (BDV; n\n = 1), bovine herpesvirus, type 1 (BHV; n\n = 1), bovine reovirus, types 1 and 3 (n\n = 2), bovine adenovirus, types 1 and 6 (BAV; n\n = 2) and human RSV, types A and B (HRSV; n\n = 3).",

Although the nested PCR is undoubtedly effective, the practical application is rather complicated. It takes five laborious steps to achieve the final results: reverse transcription, two rounds of amplification, gel electrophoresis and photography.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the development and application of an fRT-PCR system for the direct diagnosis of respiratory diseases caused by BRSV. Although Werling et al. (2002) published recently a BRSV TaqMan PCR assay, their method was developed for research purposes, in order to measure viral mRNA levels in the context of cytokine responses. Our intention was to develop a simple and high throughput fRT-PCR assay and to investigate its diagnostic applicability by testing clinical samples from experimentally and naturally infected animals. Compared to nested PCR, the single-tube fRT-PCR assay has important advantages. By including rTth DNA polymerase, which acts both as a thermoactive reverse transcriptase and a thermostable DNA polymerase, a separate RT step was avoided and the reactions require less than 3 h to complete (from RT reaction to results), compared to 7\u20138 h for RT and nested PCR. Unlike other protocols, neither the addition of a second enzyme nor an alteration in buffer composition is required between the reverse transcription and the PCR.",
