Italian financial firms experienced the highest negative return during COVID-19 period, while the UK had the highest negative return for its nonfinancial firms during the same period. Negative returns are associated with the number of confirmed cases in China and G7 countries (see, Figure 1 ). The UK market return dropped by 40% during the period (December 31, 2019-March 20, 2020). Similarly, market indices in other G7 countries experienced a significant drop during the COVID-19 period (see, Figure 1 ).",

Interestingly, the optimal weights appear to be time-varying (see, Figure 4 ) and change during the COVID-19 period. For instance, the optimal weight of the Chinese financial sector in the portfolio of Chinese and US financial sector increased from 0.2949 in the pre-COVID-19 period to 0.4199 during the COVID-19 period.

First, it seems that most of the optimal hedge ratios for financial and nonfinancial sectors have significantly changed during the COVID-19 period. Some of them have increased while others have decreased. For example, the hedge ratio for China-Japan financial (nonfinancial) firms increased from 0.2645 (0.2788) in the pre-COVID-19 period to 0.4252 (0.4240) in the COVID-19 period. The increase in hedging ratios suggests higher hedging costs during the COVID-19 period due to the larger number of contracts required to short Chinese financial and non-financial sectors. The results are consistent with the literature that shows higher hedge ratios during crisis periods(Antonakakis et al., 2018; Batten et al., 2019). Also, Chow breakpoint test indicates that there is a structural break in hedge ratios on December 31, 2019, when the first confirmed case of COVID-19 is reported by the WHO. Second, the hedge ratios for China-World financial and nonfinancial sectors appear to be higher than those of developed countries (G7). This implies that compared to G7 countries, the hedging cost is higher for the global financial and nonfinancial sectors when shorting Chinese financial and nonfinancial sectors. These results suggest the increased challenges for financial risk management during COVID19 period and",
