This procedure involves a process called templating where the helical sequence of interest is inserted into a parallel two\u2010stranded \u03b1\u2010helical coiled\u2010coil and disulfide\u2010bridged template which maintains the native helical conformation of the epitope, presents all the surface\u2010exposed residues of the \u03b1\u2010helix in the native protein and optimizes stability of the immunogen (Figure 2). To optimize the conformational stability of the immunogen, two synthetic peptides are stabilized in a two\u2010stranded, coiled\u2010coil configuration by substituting at each of the hydrophobic residues in the a and d positions of the native \u03b1\u2010helix with isoleucine and leucine, respectively; and also linking the two templated peptides with a disulfide bond. It is well known that residues at the a and d positions define the hydrophobic interface between the helices and are critical for determining the oligomerization state and stability of coiled\u2010coils. For example, the \u03b2\u2010branched hydrophobic residues Ile and Val provide significantly greater stability to the coiled\u2010coil than that of the similarly sized hydrophobic residue, Leu, when placed at position a,26, 27, 28 whereas Leu appeared to provide more stability at position d.28 Harbury et al. using synthetic analogs of GCN4, have shown that subtle changes in the type of hydrophobic core residues can result in selective formation of dimer, trimer and tetramer structures.29 Hodges and co\u2010workers carried out the complete biophysical characterization of a 38\u2010residue model coiled\u2010coil substituted by 20 different amino acid residues at position a and position d to determine their effect on protein stability.30, 31, 32 Woolfson and Alber developed an algorithm to predict the oligomerization states of coiled\u2010coils.33\n",

Similarly, in the two\u2010stranded \u03b1\u2010helical coiled\u2010coil immunogen, each of the b, c, e, f, and g residues are also exposed on the surface and are identical to the corresponding residues displayed on the surface of the selected native \u03b1\u2010helix in the stem domain (denoted by asterisks Figure 2 which creates two helical surfaces (blue), each which generate antibodies that bind the helix of interest in the native protein. In the native trimeric spike protein the helix may be a single \u03b1\u2010helix either stabilized by surrounding protein regions or stabilized in a trimeric coiled\u2010coil in the stem domain of the spike protein. What is unique with our technology is that the resulting antibodies from our immunogens bind to a single \u03b1\u2010helical surface and are dramatically different from the binding sites of monoclonal antibodies that bind to the stem region of hemagglutinin. These monoclonal antibodies binding sites involve complex conformational epitopes rather than a single helix.6, 7, 8, 12\n",

Amino acids were coupled as their N\u03b1\u2010tert\u2010butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives (fivefold molar excess), and reactive side\u2010chains were protected as follows: Arg, tosyl (Tos); Asn, 9\u2010H\u2010xanthen\u20109\u2010yl (Xan); Asp, cyclohexyl (OcHx); Cys, 4\u2010methylbenzyl (MeBzl); Gln, 9\u2010H\u2010xanthen\u20109\u2010yl (Xan); Glu, cyclohexyl (OcHx); His, benzyloxymethyl (Bom); Lys, 2\u2010chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2\u2010Cl\u2010Z); Ser, benzyl (Bzl); Thr, benzyl (Bzl); Trp, formyl (For).

Cys and His were coupled without pre\u2010activation to prevent racemization. Coupling reactions were monitored at each step by using the ninhydrin (Kaiser) test. Couplings that were incomplete after 3 h were recoupled. Removal of N\n\u03b1\u2010Boc protection at each step was accomplished by treatment for 30 min with 35% trifluoroacetic acid/CH2Cl2 (v/v) containing indole (1 mg ml\u22121).

Deprotection of Ni\u2010formyl\u2010tryptophan was carried out using piperidine in DMF (1.5 h; 0\u00b0C) before HF\u2010cleavage. Side\u2010chain deprotection and peptide cleavage from the resin was carried out using a cleavage cocktail consisting of HF:anisol:DMS (dimethylsulfide):EDT (1,2\u2010ethanedithiol):p\u2010thiocresol (8.5:0.5:0.5:0.3:0.2, 1.5 h; 0\u00b0C).

Proteins pH1N1 were included in the search, along with partial sequences. This resulted in 29,848 H1N1 sequences; 5708 H5N1 sequences; and 25,361 H3N2 sequences. A filter was applied to the sequence names to obtain the date of origin, and although we did not filter by date in the analyses presented, we did filter out sequences with ambiguous dates, along with chimeric sequences. The downloaded sequences are available in the files fluH1n1.fasta, fluH5n1.fasta, and fluH3N2.fasta. To obtain a complete analysis of the variability in the full sets of applicable sequences, we wrote a short program in perl, called \u201cflucheck.pl\u201d; this will be made available on our laboratory web site (http://www.evolutionarygenomics.com). The aim of the analysis is to show the variability of short sequence fragments (kmers) by position. This is an alignment\u2010free analysis, so the kmer positions are relative to one another. The program parameters can be adjusted through a control file, but the most relevant parameters are the minimum kmer count considered, and also the minimum transition count considered to obtain the relative positions. For the H1N1 and H3N2 datasets, these were set to 200, and for the H5N1 dataset (with far fewer sequences) they were set to 100.

We developed a novel computational technology called StableCoil to select the most stable amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helices in any protein that have the potential to form stable coiled\u2010coil structures. StableCoil is based entirely on experimentally determined physiochemical parameters. These parameters include stability coefficients derived from model coiled\u2010coils30, 31, 32 and \u03b1\u2010helical propensity values derived from synthetic amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helical peptides.35 When considering a protein sequence of interest, there are seven possible reading frames in which a repeating heptad sequence (abcdefg)n can be found. StableCoil considers all seven possible reading frames and generates predicted stability data for each one. As a result, StableCoil avoids the need for screening large numbers of vaccine constructs by defining the reading frame(s) that contain predicted coiled\u2010coil sequences and indicating which residues belong to each position in the heptad repeat (abcdefg)n. StableCoil rapidly identifies the region(s) of interest, thus reducing the number of B\u2010cell epitopes that must be studied experimentally. StableCoil cannot predict which of these amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helices will produce neutralizing antibodies but the importance of greatly reducing the number of helical epitopes as potential vaccine candidates cannot be over emphasized.",

We previously demonstrated that the contribution of disulfide bonds to protein stability was dependent on whether the disulfide bond was at position a or d in the hydrophobic core of the coiled\u2010coil. A disulfide bond at any position d (near\u2010optimal geometry) makes the largest contribution to coiled\u2010coil stability.38 The only a position that contributes significantly to coiled\u2010coil stability is a disulfide bond inserted at the N\u2010terminal where the increase in stability is similar to a d position at the C\u2010terminal end of the coiled\u2010coil.38 We also showed that the hydrophobic interactions at position a and d are less important at the ends of coiled\u2010coil and the ends of coiled\u2010coil are more flexible.27 Thus, a disulfide\u2010bond at the ends of coiled\u2010coil prevents end\u2010fraying, stabilizes the coiled\u2010coil structure and the helical conformation at the ends of the two\u2010stranded coiled\u2010coil better mimicking the helical\u2010structure of the native protein.",

The H5 sequences are essentially identical from 1959 to present. Similarly, the H3 sequences are extremely conserved since 1968 to present and the major changes observed are K to R or R to K substitutions. Based on this sequence information, it is easy to understand antibody cross\u2010reactivity from a single peptide immunogen. Because these helices are involved in the major conformational change necessary for membrane fusion and virus entry it is clear why the 5P and 6P sequence remains so highly conserved over time. The existing trivalent vaccine consists of three HA proteins, two from influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and one from influenza B. Antigenic variants of these three proteins have been in global circulation since 1977. It is our goal to select the best sequence from this region that provides an immune response in humans where the antibodies protect against all viral strains from Group 1 and Group 2.",

            "text": "The templated peptide immunogen technology provides a highly structured and stable peptide immunogen in the \u03b1\u2010helical conformation that can tolerate a wide variety of sequences. This technology can elicit antibodies that are cross\u2010reactive with HA protein subtypes in the \u03b1\u2010helical regions of the stem domain that are involved in membrane fusion and virus entry. The template was designed for maximum stability by creating a hydrophobic core consisting of Ile at position a and Leu at position d and an interchain disulfide\u2010bridge at position a at the end of the coiled\u2010coil. These changes also lock the immunogen into a two\u2010stranded coiled\u2010coil structure. It is interesting that the \u03b1\u2010helices on the two\u2010stranded structure generate antibodies that bind to the \u03b1\u2010helices in the native hemagglutinin three\u2010stranded coiled\u2010coil in the stem domain. Our design greatly simplifies the immunogen structure. This technology leaves five out of every seven residues surface\u2010exposed and mimics the native amphipathic \u03b1\u2010helix in the native protein. Our research suggests that 28\u2010residue B\u2010cell epitopes are ideal to generate conformation\u2010specific antibodies. We also discovered that subtle changes in the design of the peptide immunogens can have dramatic effects on the cross\u2010reactivity of the resulting antibodies. For example, as shown with immunogens 6A and 6P (Figure 4) we extended the sequence of immunogen 6A by 7\u2010residues at the N\u2010terminus and repositioned the disulfide bond from the N\u2010terminus to the C\u2010terminus for immunogen 6P. These subtle changes in sequence changed antibody cross\u2010reactivity from H1N1 specific (Figure 4(6A)) to antibodies that were cross\u2010reactive to three group 1 HA proteins, including H1N1, H5N1 and H2N2 (Figure 4(6P)). Similarly, when comparing immunogens 5A and 5P (Figure 5) we extended this sequence at the C\u2010terminal by 2 residues and repositioned the disulfide bond from the N\u2010terminal of immunogen 5A to the C\u2010terminus of 5P. The immunogen 5P shows the best cross\u2010reactivity against Group1 and Group 2 HA proteins and this change improved the cross\u2010reactivity to H7 hemagglutinin.",
