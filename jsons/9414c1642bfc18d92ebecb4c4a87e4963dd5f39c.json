The requirement to stay home leads to greater exposure to indoor pollutants, such as tobacco smoke or volatile organic compounds (1) .

Furthermore, during quarantine, routine dermatologic visits are difficult to access; indeed, teledermatology programs increase during lockdown (4), and some patients stop taking immunosuppressive drugs on their own initiative for the fear of contracting COVID-19. All these considerations suggest the hypothesis that COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with changes in lifestyle of AD patients that can significantly influence their clinical disease activity. Obviously, epidemiological studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, which, if confirmed, could also lead to more information on the pathogenesis of AD.",
