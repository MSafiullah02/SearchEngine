            "text": "Turner To the Editor: We thank Dr. Gersh for her interest and comments on our manuscript, as well as for taking the time to express her concerns on this subject. We agree with Dr. Gersh that discontinuation of anti-hypertensives angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of hypertension (HTN) is unjustified at this moment due to the lack of evidence on negative effects of these drugs in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in recent weeks, several important articles have been published, shedding new light in reference to the potential interplay of ACEIs and ARBs with COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes COVID-19, penetrates the cells primarily through ACE2, its natural receptor at cell surface. Whether ACEIs and ARB administration would increase ACE2 levels or expression remains mostly speculative, as does whether increased ACE2 expression is beneficial or detrimental in COVID-19. As noted by Dr. Gersh, Diaz argued that as ACE2 levels increase after intravenous infusion of ACEIs and ARBs in animal models, taking ACEIs or ARBs may aggravate the infection severity in COVID-19 patients. 1 However, not all studies conducted in animals clearly shown increased ACE2 levels in response to ACEI/ARB administration. 2 Importantly, investigations analyzing changes in plasma or tissue ACE2 levels in humans are limited. In fact, two studies in patients with atrial fibrillation or coronary heart disease found no differences in plasma ACE2 levels between those taking ACEIs or ARBs versus those not taking these medications. 3, 4 Nonetheless, plasma levels may not reflect tissue ACE2 expression, and vice versa, and this topic requires further investigation.",

            "text": "The role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is still unknown. As hypertension is a clear risk factor for COVID-19, 5 Dr. Gersh noted that many such patients are likely to be on ACEIs or ARBs, and, as such, these anti-HTN medications may be directly connected with infection severity. However, although a relatively high percentage of COVID-19 patients hospitalized have HTN, the percentage of HTN in adults is similar worldwide, increasing with age. In patients with COVID-19, the odds of disease severity with HTN was found in meta-regression to be associated with advancing age. 5 As Marin has also stated, an epidemiological association based simply on prevalence of HTN and ACEI/ARBs in COVID-19 is inappropriate. 6 Moreover, it has been previously reported that ACE2 expression is reduced in HTN animal models and, historically, HTN has not affect outcomes of other coronavirus infections. 7 Most concerning is the fact that Marin pointed out that many patients from South America, Central America and Spain have abruptly interrupted their treatments with ACEIs or ARBs over these hypothetical concerns, which might may be as equally dangerous to the patient as COVID-19 itself. 6 Thankfully, to address these concerns, new data are emerging. Mehra et al. 8 analyzed the factors associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in 8,910 COVID-19 patients included in an observational database of 169 worldwide hospitals. Among those factors, the authors found that ACEIs were independently associated with a significant 67% reduction in mortality in a subgroup with hypertension, whereas ARBs were associated with an insignificant 23% higher mortality. 8 Taking ACEIs or statins were associated with higher rates of survival after hospital discharge, while taking ARBs had no effect. Additionally, there was no increased risk of in-hospital death associated with either ACEIs (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). Likewise, Mancia et al. 9 carried out a case-control study involving 6,272 confirmed COVID-19 patients from the Lombardy region of Italy. They compared COVID-19 patients with 30,759 controls matched by age, sex, and municipality of residence. Neither ACEIs , nor ARBs, were associated with increased probability of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 in multivariate logistic-regression analysis. Moreover, no association was observed between these drugs and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. Reynolds et al. 10 analyzed the data of 5,894 COVID-19 patients (tested positive) from the New York University (NYU) Langone Health electronic health record, 1,002 with severe disease (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death). Through a Bayesian approach, no association between taking ACEIs or ARBs and positive test result or COVID-19 severity could be found.",

            "text": "In a retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 COVID-19 patients with HTN hospitalized at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China (January 15 to March 15, 2020), Li et al. 11 studied the association between ACEIs/ARB and severity of illness and mortality. There were no differences between the percentage of patients with HTN taking ACEIS/ARB with severe and non-severe infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; p=0.645), or between non-survivors and survivors (27.3%vs 33.0%; p=0.34). Unlike the Mehra et al. 8 data, which suggested more benefits with ACEIs, no differences were observed between patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs. These authors concluded that neither ACEIs nor ARBs may be associated with severity or mortality of COVID-19 patients. 8 In a retrospective, multicenter study including 1128 adult COVID-19 Chinese patients with HTN, 188 taking ACEIs/ARBs and 940 without these agents, Zhang et al. 12 reported that unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEIs/ARBs group versus the non-ACEIs/ARBs group (3.7% vs. 9.8%; p=0.01). After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the risk for allcause mortality was still lower in the ACEIs/ARBs group versus the non-ACEIs/ARBs group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; p=0.03). Their results also demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEIs/ARBs versus those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03) in a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model. Moreover, compared to other anti-HTN drugs, ACEIs/ARBs were associated with lower mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01) in COVID-19. Therefore, what can be reasonably concluded from the recently published large single and multi-center studies from multiple countries, is that there is no significant risk of disease severity or mortality associated with ACEI/ARB, with some even suggesting potential benefits in patient with COIVD-19.",

            "text": "The mechanism behind any potential benefit of ACEI and ARB in COVID-19 is still enigmatic. Differences in inflammatory and immune biomarkers has been reported in COVID-19 patients taking ACEI and ARBs. Meng et al. 13 found a reduced rate of severe COVID-19 disease and lower levels of interleukin-6, increased CD3 and CD8 T-cell in peripheral blood, and decreased peak viral loads compared to those using other anti-HTN medication. Moreover, Yang et al. reported that COVID-19 patients with HTN taking ACEI and ARBs had significantly lower C reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as decreased rate of critical illness and death. 14 ARBs may also exert beneficial effects in patients with sepsis, pneumonia and influenza. Moreover, a combination of statin and ARBs appeared to substantially reduce mortality during the recent Ebola outbreak dramatically, 15 similar to the reduction in mortality noted by Mehra et al. 8 with ACEIs/statin therapy in COVID-19. It has been suggested that higher doses of ARBs may protect COVID-19 patients from acute lung injury (ALI) via two complementary mechanisms: (i) by blocking excessive angiotensin II binding promoting vasoconstriction, inflammation, and oxidative damage; ii) by up-regulating ACE2 and increasing angiotensin 1-7 production. 16 In fact, trials using Losartan to reduce ALI in COVID-19 are currently underway in the United States. Interestingly, ACEI were reported by Mehra et al. 8 to reduce mortality, while a similar effect could not be noted for ARBs. This warrants immediate further investigation. We hypothesize that ACEI may not only attenuate the increase in angiotensin II, but via reduced endothelial dysfunction and decreased expression of tissue plasminogen activator-1 and increase tissue plasminogen activator levels (tPA) due to decreased bradykinin breakdown, may mitigate the reported COVID-19 associated coagulopathy; such coagulopathy may drive ALI and multiple organ dysfunction. 17 As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the cardiovascular health of patients must not be neglected at the expense of outbreak. ACEIs and ARBs improve outcomes and increase survival in multiple cardiovascular diseases. While further investigation in prospective studies is warranted, the preponderance of current data and evidence makes it highly unlikely that the use of ACEIs/ARBs may be associated with increased severity or mortality risk. In summary, the newly reported data supports current guidelines and health professional recommendations for continuation of ACEI/ARBs for treating HTN during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
