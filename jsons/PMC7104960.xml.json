Coverage for atypical bacteria\nand MDR pathogens should be considered if risk factors for these pathogens are present\n(Table 2). Atypical and MDR pathogens are more\ncommon in patients requiring ICU care. Patients with severe CAP treated with combination\nantibiotic therapy including a macrolide have an improved survival rate compared with\nmonotherapy. Empirical macrolide monotherapy should be avoided due to emerging pneumococcal\nresistance. Once a pathogen is identified, antibiotic coverage should be narrowed unless\nthere are concerns about dual pathogen infection. This approach is associated with fewer\ncomplications, reduced risk of Clostridium difficile infection, and\nminimizes development of antibiotic resistance. In severe disease, septic shock or in a\nnon-responding patient, continuous infusions of time-dependent antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactams\nand carbapenems may improve outcome. There is however an elevated risk of both line-related\ninfections and thrombophlebitis, both of which are more prevalent in immunosuppressed\npatients.14",
