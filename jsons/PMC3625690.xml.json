            "text": "The replication of many viruses (particularly DNA viruses and retroviruses) involves nuclear steps (Griffin et al., 2007). Even for viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (e.g. many negative\u2010stranded RNA viruses), it is not uncommon for specific viral proteins to enter the nucleus during certain stages of infection to achieve specific functions such as antagonising the host's immune activation (Katze et al., 2002; Ramachandran and Horvath, 2009; Goodbourn and Randall, 2009) or global inhibition of host gene expression (Petersen et al., 2000; von Kobbe et al., 2000). The nuclear import and export of viral proteins depend on the host cell machinery and are subject to regulation by pathways that normally modulate the trafficking of cellular proteins, including post\u2010translational modifications. Conjugation of modifying groups such as phosphate, acetyl group, ubiquitin (Ub), and Ub\u2010like molecules is a rapid and efficient way of modulating the properties of proteins after their synthesis (Ulrich, 2005). Particularly, Ub and small ubiquitin\u2010related modifiers (SUMOs) have drawn much attention in recent years due to their roles in diverse biological functions (Denuc and Marfany, 2010; Liu and Walters, 2010). Although the regulatory functions of Ub and SUMO in the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular proteins have been extensively studied (Wilson and Rangasamy, 2001; Pichler and Melchior, 2002; Shcherbik and Haines, 2004), their involvement in viral protein trafficking has been only recently appreciated. In this review, we will summarise our current knowledge on Ub\u2010 and SUMO\u2010regulated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of cellular proteins and give a few examples of how these pathways are exploited by viruses.",

In most cases, these signals are recognised by import or export receptors of the karyopherin\u2010\u03b2 family either directly or via an adapter (Sorokin et al., 2007). The best\u2010characterised nuclear import pathway involves importin \u03b1/\u03b2, which mediates the nuclear translocation of nuclear localisation signal (NLS)\u2010containing cargoes in a Ran\u2010dependent manner, as illustrated in Figure 1. Similarly, the export transporter chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM\u20101; or exportin 1) mediates the nuclear export of a large number of cargoes containing nuclear export signals (NESs) [steps (5) and (6) in Figure 1]. For a comprehensive review of the nuclear import/export machinery, readers are referred to Moroianu (1999), Sorokin et al. (2007) and Jamali et al. (2011). In addition, the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of many proteins is also subject to regulation by post\u2010translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation (Jans and H\u00fcbner, 1996; Wilson and Rangasamy, 2001; Shcherbik and Haines, 2004).",

Ub conjugation occurs by the sequential action of three enzymes: (i) a Ub\u2010activating enzyme (E1), (ii) a Ub\u2010conjugating enzyme (E2) and (iii) a Ub ligase (E3), which determines substrate specificity and the type of conjugation (e.g. monoUb versus polyUb, K48\u2010 versus K63\u2010linked Ub). The ubiquitination machinery has been reviewed in Kerscher et al. (2006). Though initially described as a regulator of protein degradation (Wilkinson et al., 1980), Ub is now known to play important roles in a broad spectrum of cellular activities such as intracellular protein trafficking, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, cell\u2010cycle progression and apoptosis (Shcherbik and Haines, 2004; Liu and Walters, 2010).",

Unmodified RanGAP1 is diffused in the cytoplasm, whereas SUMO conjugation targets it to the nuclear pore complex, where it regulates protein/RNA trafficking across the nuclear membrane (Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1998). Since then SUMO has been associated with the nuclear/subnuclear targeting of various cellular proteins (discussed below). The vertebrate genome encodes at least four SUMO isoforms, namely SUMO1\u20104. Similar to ubiquitination, SUMOylation is a three\u2010step process involving an E1\u2010activating enzyme heterodimer Aos/Uba2, an E2\u2010conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and substrate\u2010specific E3 ligases (reviewed in Gareau and Lima, 2010).",

            "text": "Ubiquitination is usually associated with cytoplasmic localisation via promoting either nuclear export or cytoplasmic retention. The best\u2010characterised example is the tumour suppressor gene p53 (reviewed in Shcherbik and Haines, 2004; Stehmeier and Muller, 2009; Lee and Gu, 2010). P53 is ubiquitinated on its six C\u2010terminal lysine residues by the E3 Ub ligase Mdm2 (Honda et al., 1997; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Lohrum et al., 2001; Nakamura et al., 2002). Although polyubiquitination results in proteasomal degradation, monoubiquitination by the same E3 ligase leads to nuclear export (Li et al., 2003) [pathways (1) and (2) in Figure 2]. It has been postulated that Ub modification induces a conformational change, leading to unmasking of the NES which resides in the proximity of the Ub sites (Shcherbik and Haines, 2004). Once in the cytoplasm, p53 can be deubiquitinated by the deubiquitinase USP10, resulting in its translocation back to the nucleus (Yuan et al., 2010) [pathway (3) in Figure 2]. Polyubiquitination of transcription factors Sma\u2010 and MAD\u2010related protein 3 (Smad3) and hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF\u2010\u03b1) has also been linked to their export from the nucleus and termination of transcriptional activation (Fukuchi et al., 2001; Groulx and Lee, 2002). Alternatively, ubiquitination can favour cytoplasmic localisation by inhibiting nuclear import, which is exemplified in the case of CTP\u2013phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT\u2010\u03b1). The regulatory enzyme CCT\u2010\u03b1 can switch between an inactive form in the cytoplasm and an active form in the nucleus. It possesses an NLS located in close proximity of the putative ubiquitination site. By using CCT\u03b1\u2013Ub hybrid constructs that vary in the intermolecular distance between Ub and the NLS, the authors showed that monoubiquitination masks the NLS, resulting in the disruption of importin\u2010\u03b1 binding and consequently a blockage in the nuclear import (Chen and Mallampalli, 2009).",

A good example is the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (Trotman et al., 2007). Though no conventional NLSs have been identified in PTEN, the tumour suppressor is able to translocate into the nucleus. Ubiquitination on lysine residue K289 likely plays a role in the nuclear import of PTEN because the K289E mutant, associated with Cowden syndrome, is defective in nuclear import, monoubiquitination, as well as its tumour suppression ability. The authors further identified another monoubiquitination site K13, which is also found to be mutated in spontaneous cancer, as being important for nuclear import.",

SUMO site mutation favours cytoplasmic localisation in all three cases; however, whether this is mediated through promoting nuclear import or inhibiting nuclear export is not clear. On the other hand, nuclear targeting of promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) per se does not seem to require SUMOylation, as mutating the SUMO site does not prevent its nuclear accumulation. However, SUMOylation of PML is important for its localisation in nuclear bodies (Zhong et al., 2000; Lallemand\u2010Breitenbach et al., 2001).",

In the nucleus, Tax is predominantly localised to heterogeneous nuclear foci known as Tax speckled structures (TSS), which contain a variety of cellular proteins including transcription factors, splicing cofactors, and DNA damage recognition and cell cycle regulatory factors (Semmes et al., 1996; Bex et al., 1997; Haoudi et al., 2003). In the cytoplasm, a major fraction of Tax localises to perinuclear structures colocalising with the centrosome or microtubule\u2010organising center in close association with the cis\u2010Golgi compartment (Nejmeddine et al., 2005; Kfoury et al., 2008; Kfoury et al., 2011). Using a photoconvertible fluorophore (Dendra\u20102) coupled with live cell confocal microscopy, Kfoury et al. (2011) recently showed that the same Tax molecule can shuttle amongst Tax nuclear bodies as well as between Tax nuclear bodies and the centrosome. This dynamic shuttling is important for its function in interaction with NEMO and activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (Kfoury et al., 2011). Cellular stress such as UV irradiation induces the translocation of Tax from TSS to the cytoplasm (Gatza and Marriott, 2006; Gatza et al., 2007). The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Tax is mediated by a non\u2010canonical NLS at the N\u2010terminal (Smith and Greene, 1990; Smith and Greene, 1992; Meertens et al., 2004) and a leucine\u2010rich NES (Burton et al., 2000; Alefantis et al., 2003). However, Tax also undergoes different forms of post\u2010translational modification, including phosphorylation (Bex et al., 1999), acetylation (Lodewick et al., 2009), ubiquitination (Nasr et al., 2006; Kfoury et al., 2008) and SUMOylation (Nasr et al., 2006; Kfoury et al., 2011), all of which are implicated in its functions. Particularly, ubiquitination and SUMOylation have been shown to be involved in its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (Figure 3).",

Although K48 Ub chains lead to Tax degradation, K63 Ub chains mediate binding to NEMO, recruitment of the IKK signalosome to the centrosome and activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (Peloponese et al., 2004; Kfoury et al., 2008). The ubiquitination sites have been mapped to the C\u2010terminal lysine residues (K263, K280 and K284). Mutating these three K residue results in a dramatic reduction of polyUb and monoUb of Tax, whereas the three N\u2010terminal K residues have minimal effect on Tax Ub (Chiari et al., 2004).

Following UV irradiation, a rapid translocation of Tax from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was observed. The UV\u2010induced translocation correlates with an increase in monoUb of Tax at K280 and K284 residues. The K280/284R double mutant is not ubiquitinated and does not translocate to the cytoplasm after UV treatment. Moreover, fusing a copy of Ub to either the N\u2010terminal or C\u2010terminal of Tax to mimic monoubiquitination induces nuclear export. Interestingly, the nuclear export of the Tax\u2013Ub fusion protein is blocked by leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM\u20101\u2010dependent pathway, indicating that the Ub\u2010induced nuclear export of Tax is still dependent on a functional NES. The authors proposed that monoUb facilitates the dissociation of Tax from TSS in the nucleus, promoting its nuclear export (Gatza et al., 2007). Lamsoul et al. (2005) also reported that Ub favours cytoplasmic localisation of Tax. Overexpression of Ub results in increased cytoplasmic localisation of Tax, which is phenocopied by fusing one copy of Ub to the C\u2010terminal of the protein. Because co\u2010localisation between Tax and exogenously expressed Ub is observed only in the cytoplasm, the authors concluded that ubiquitination is involved in the cytoplasmic retention of Tax. However, the absence of detectable co\u2010localisation between Tax and Ub in the nucleus does not preclude the possibility that the ubiquitinated species are rapidly exported out of the nucleus.",

Ub and SUMO seem to have opposing effects on Tax subcellular distribution. Although Ub favours cytoplasmic localisation, as discussed above, SUMO overexpression leads to predominantly nuclear body localisation. SUMOylation seems to be required for targeting Tax to nuclear bodies [pathway (2) in Figure 3] because Ub/SUMO site mutants fail to localise to nuclear speckles, and nuclear body formation can be restored by C\u2010terminal fusion of SUMO but not Ub (Lamsoul et al., 2005). Kfoury et al. (2011) showed later that Ub fusion to the same K mutants can restore nuclear body localisation as well, suggesting that Ub can also target Tax to nuclear bodies [pathway (3) in Figure 3]. The discrepancy between the two studies possibly stems from the different cell types used (293T cells in the Lamsoul paper versus HeLa cells in the Kfoury paper) because the localisation of Tax is known to be cell type dependent (Alefantis et al., 2003). The nuclear retention induced by SUMOylation is possibly via NES masking, in agreement with an earlier report suggesting that the Tax NES likely exists as a conditionally masked signal (Alefantis et al., 2003).",

Similar to E1B\u201055K, the E1 protein of bovine papillomavirus (BPV) has been shown to be SUMOylated by host cell machinery, although the role of SUMOylation in the intracellular distribution of BPV E1 is controversial (see below). SUMOylation of BPV E1 is possibly mediated through the host SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and PIAS family E3 SUMO ligases (Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000; Rosas\u2010Acosta et al., 2005). SUMOylation on lysine residue 514 seems to be important for nuclear targeting. In transfected COS\u20101 cells, although wild\u2010type E1 accumulates in intranuclear foci in addition to diffused nucleoplasmic distribution with little or no cytoplasmic staining, the SUMO site mutant K514R as well as the Ubc9\u2010binding defective mutants are unable to localise to the nucleus (Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000; Rangasamy et al., 2000). However, Fradet\u2010Turcotte et al. (2009) found that in C33A cells, the nuclear localisation of the E1 proteins of human papillomavirus (HPV) 11, HPV16 and BPV is independent of SUMOylation. These authors showed that HPV11 E1 binds to Ubc9 similar to BPV E1, as reported previously, but the nuclear accumulation of HPV11 E1 is not affected by mutations that weaken Ubc9 binding and by inhibition of the SUMO pathway using a SUMO\u2010activating enzyme inhibitor Gam1, a dominant negative version of Ubc9 or shRNA depletion of Ubc9 (Fradet\u2010Turcotte et al., 2009). Quite surprisingly, the authors also found that contrary to the previous report by Rangasamy et al. (2000), the SUMOylation site mutants of BPV E1 are not defective in the nuclear localisation in C33A cells (Fradet\u2010Turcotte et al., 2009). Interestingly, another report by Rosas\u2010Acosta et al. (2005) suggested that SUMOylation might mediate nuclear export of BPV E1 by enhancing its interaction with CRM\u20101 (Rosas\u2010Acosta and Wilson, 2008). According to this report, the non\u2010SUMOylatable mutant is almost exclusively nuclear and is more enriched in close proximity to the nuclear envelope as compared with the wild\u2010type form, supporting a role for SUMO in the intracellular distribution of BPV E1 albeit different from the one previously suggested (Rangasamy et al., 2000).",

Rta can also be modified by SUMO2/3 in the presence of viral protein LF2. LF2 binding induces the translocation of Rta from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and represses its activity, but this redistribution of Rta seems to be independent of its SUMOylation (Calderwood et al., 2008; Heilmann et al., 2010). Similarly, Zta can be modified by SUMO\u20101, 2 and 3, but in contrast to Rta, SUMO\u20101 modification of Zta seems to repress its transactivation activity (Adamson and Kenney, 2001; Adamson, 2005; Hagemeier et al., 2010).

Ub depletion by proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and bortezomib restricts matrix to the nucleus, which is phenocopied by mutating the putative ubiquitination site (K258) from lysine to arginine. Moreover, fusing a copy of Ub to mimic monoubiquitination restores nuclear export to the K258R mutant, supporting the hypothesis that monoubiquitination of matrix promotes its nuclear export.

Nevertheless, these past few years have witnessed a fast\u2010growing list of viruses that utilise the host's Ub/SUMO system to facilitate various steps of their life cycle [for a complete review of viral takeover of the Ub/SUMO system, readers are referred to references Boggio and Chiocca (2006); Gustin et al. (2011)). Therefore, targeting the Ub/SUMO system (via either global inhibition of the pathways or modulating the functions of individual components such as Ub/SUMO ligases and deubiquitinating/deSUMOylating enzymes) can potentially be a way to develop broad\u2010spectrum antivirals. Indeed, the US Food and Drug Administration\u2010approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has been shown to inhibit different families of viruses including Hepatitis B virus (Hepadnaviridae) (Bandi et al., 2010), HIV (Retroviridae) (Yu et al., 2009), vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae) (Neznanov et al., 2008; Dudek et al., 2010), influenza A virus (Orthomyxoviridae) (Dudek et al., 2010), NiV (Paramyxoviridae) (Wang et al., 2010), coronaviruses (Coronaviridae) (Raaben et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010) and orthopoxviruses (Poxviridae) (Teale et al., 2009). However, most of these studies have been done in in vitro models, and it is important to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of bortezomib and its oral equivalents such as MLN9708 and PR\u2010047 (Zhou et al., 2009; Kupperman et al., 2010; Dick and Fleming, 2010) as potential broad\u2010spectrum antivirals.",
