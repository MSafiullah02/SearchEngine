Although the article by Fan et al provides valuable information for clinical treatment in COVID-19, we still have some concerns about it.",

Thus, selection bias cannot be entirely excluded. Furthermore, the data of other causes of liver injury in the patients progressing to liver injury, such as herbal medicines or other drugs used as self-medication before developing COVID-19 pneumonia, were not available for patients in current study. However, since the COVID-19 outbreak in China in December 2019, discussion about COVID-19 has spread rapidly on the Internet and has quickly become the focus of worldwide attention. Shanghai is one of the most developed cities in China, and access to the Internet is widespread, which means many in the population would have a high degree of awareness of the disease. Most patients (>70%) went to the hospital within 5 days after the onset of disease symptoms and rarely used over-the-counter medicine to self-treat because medical insurance is widely available in Shanghai. Hence, although the data on herbs and other drugs used as self-medication before developing COVID-19 pneumonia were not available in this study, their influence on the results cannot be ignored.",

            "text": "Second, high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure might contribute to liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure can contribute to hepatic congestion by increasing right atrial pressure and impeding venous return.2 However, whether the COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital with liver blood test abnormalities received mechanical ventilation remained unclear in current study. Furthermore, lymphocytes are important for inhibiting overactive innate immune responses during viral infection. Typical lymphopenia during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in increases in interleukin 6, interleukin 10, and interferon-\u03b3 levels and aggravated inflammatory responses, leading not only to pulmonary injury but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver.3 A study by Lu et al4 investigated the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 and found that lymphopenia and C-reactive protein level were independently associated with liver injury. However, there was no statistical difference between abnormal and normal groups in lymphopenia; the cause of these results that contradicted the data of Lu et al is also still unknown in this study.",

Preliminary data reported by Zhang et al5 indicate that 2%\u201311% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities, and whether the results in this study contradict the data of Zhang et al was unclear in this study. In addition, remdesivir treatment during COVID-19 can also induce liver impairment. In an article describing the first 12 patients with COVID-19 in the United States, the 3 hospitalized patients, who received remdesivir at the time of clinical worsening, had elevated liver enzymes.6 However, this issue has not been mentioned in the current study, and the authors should give some interpretation and explanation of these data.",
