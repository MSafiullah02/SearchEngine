No one can tell how much time it takes to reach a new level of perfection, and that the development of vaccines for active immunization is a long process.",

The trimeric, transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of the virus, SARS-2-S, includes two main functional subunits: S1 and S2. The former, in turn, consists of the four core domains, S1A, S1B, S1C, and S1D, that contribute to the attachment to the surface receptor of target cells. Then, the latter coordinates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Receptor binding activates proteases that can carry out proteolytic cleavage of the S protein. In coronaviruses, cleavage occurs at two sites: the S1/S2 junction and at the S2\u2032, a region close to the viral fusion peptide [2]. Proteolytic cleavage of the S protein causes conformational changes so that they cannot revert to the original structure and profound enough to prime the S2 subunit for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes.",

There is a significant degree of resemblance of greater than 90% in the nucleotide sequence of the viral genomes between SL-CoV Rp3 [12] and the Tor2 strain of SARS-CoV \u2013 which was isolated in Toronto [15]. The differences in the genome sequences of SARS-CoV in the two species occur merely in the S gene \u2013 which encodes the S1 domain of the coronavirus spike protein and contains regions with high mutation rates [12]. The coronaviruses commonly possess five open reading frames (ORF) that correlate with the production of the replicase polyprotein (P), the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The human SARS-CoV Tor2 and bat SL-CoV Rp3 strains remain more than 90% identical at the proteins P, E, M, and N. the protein S consists of two main domains: 1) the S1 domain conveys the role of receptor binding and 2) the S2 domain assumes the role of the fusion of viral and host-cell membranes. In particular, the human SARS-CoV Tor2 strain shows a noticeable degree of difference in the S1 domain from the bat SL-CoV Rp3 strain. This diversity would suffice to produce functional differences between the species, and is an apparent reason why bat sera having high levels of cross-reactive antibodies not acted efficiently to neutralize SARS-CoV.",

In addition to a daily regimen, they can be used in the form of pulse therapy to treat flares of autoimmune diseases. However, caution in the use of corticosteroids is needed due to the potential serious side effects associated with corticosteroid drugs and that corticosteroids generally suppress the immune system. The latter means that corticosteroids modulate hyper inflammation and, on the other hand, inhibit immune responses that are vital for the host defense against the virus [29].",

Among the four compounds, the only ciclesonide was capable of inhibiting viral replication. Also, ciclesonide induced a significant inhibition of viral replication of other human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV, and another positive-strand RNA virus, rubella virus, while not affect the viral replication of negative-strand RNA viruses, e.g., influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. For the MERS-CoV, a nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15) appeared to act as the target of ciclesonide. An amino acid substitution in the NSP15 conferred resistance of the mutated MERS-CoV to ciclesonide. Mometasone could help deal effectively with the mutated MERS-CoV. For the SARS-CoV2, all three ciclesonide, mometasone, and lopinavir were able to inhibit viral replication to a similar degree. Interestingly, their effect was more noticeable than serine protease inhibitors, e.g., nafamostat and camostat in cells that Vero cells that express TMPRSS2. It indicates the tendency of the SARS-CoV2 to enter the cell through the cathepsin/endosomal pathway rather than through the TMPRSS2/cell surface pathway.",

The infection of human cells by SARS-CoV2 includes two sequential steps: attachment of the virus to the surface receptor of target cells and the fusion of viral and host membranes. The former requires at least a receptor-binding domain on the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein that can interact with a cell surface receptor, for example, ACE2, expressed on human cells. The latter requires at least the host protease(s) to mediate proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein into S1 and S2 subunits and consequently promote the fusion of viral and host membranes. Also, SARS-CoV2 possesses a polybasic cleavage site that can explain the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2, N-glycans and O-glycans that make the dense decoration of SARS-CoV2 S protein, and cyclic regions that can interact with cell-surface GRP78. Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy.",

Passive immunization can be done using plasma therapy and IVIG therapy. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are ideally similar in the structure and the cell entry receptor and protease. Studies show that serum from convalescent SARS patients and serum from rabbits immunized with SARS are both able to neutralize SARS-CoV2 efficiently. However, serum from bats immunized with SARS-lice coronavirus SL-CoV Rp3 could not exert such an effect. It is due to a noticeable degree of difference in the S1 domain in the S1 domain between the bat SL-CoV Rp3 strain and SARS-CoV2. A short-term moderate dose of IVIG combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids might improve patient outcomes. Studies show that the viral RNA of SARS-CoV2 reaches its peak during the first week and then gradually decreases and that IgG and IgM begin to rise from the 10th day so that most patients have anti-viral antibodies by the 14th day. Passive immunization protects against disease, and so it should be administered as early as possible when the patient is diagnosed.",
