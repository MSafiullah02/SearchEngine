These microbes, which result from pathogen shedding due to active infection, host excretion of native gut flora, and passive transport of dietary microbes, vary in composition and concentrations based on geographic location, pathogen epidemiology, and animal host diversity 1, 2, 3, 4. Metagenomic surveys of viral communities exemplify the high diversity and varying origins of microbes in wastewater, with sequences from over 50 different viral families recovered, as well as numerous sequences too divergent to classify 2, 5. DNA metagenomes from wastewater are dominated by unknown sequences and bacteriophage sequences that likely represent viruses infecting gut bacteria, while RNA metagenomes contain eukaryotic viruses infecting plants (Virgaviridae family; likely of dietary origin), followed by viruses infecting humans, insects, and rats. While wastewater is dominated by microbes that are not pathogenic to humans, there are many types of viruses, bacteria, protozoan parasites, and helminth worms that can be transmitted via the fecal\u2013oral route, are waterborne, and cause human infections of varying severity and symptoms (e.g. respiratory, encephalitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, dermatitis) (Fig. 1A; 1, 3, 4, 6).",

However, the emergence of additional waterborne pathogens (e.g. microsporidia, mycobacteria, parvoviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses) is of growing concern 7, 8. The frequent lack of an identifiable etiological agent of gastrointestinal (GI) illness (reviewed in 9) and the prevalence of novel viruses dominating sewage 10, 11 further highlights the threat of additional pathogens present in wastewater to public health and economic productivity. Given the high incidence and concentration of pathogens in feces and wastewater, it is not surprising that the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes acute gastroenteritis as one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide 12. Furthermore, it is estimated that enteric viruses, particularly norovirus and rotavirus, are largely responsible for these infections and deaths due to their resistance to typical methods of disinfection, low infectious dose, and long persistence in the environment and on fomites 3, 4, 7, 13. Since as few as \u223c18 viral particles can cause infection, an individual infected with norovirus can excrete up to five billion infectious doses (e.g. 105\u20131011 viral copies/g feces) into wastewater 13. Given the high impact of enteric viruses on public health, this commentary will focus on the relation of enteric viruses to current and emerging paradigms in water quality monitoring, current methods used for enteric virus detection, and the growing need for methodological improvements (Fig. 1).",

According to the WHO, improvements in water management could alleviate 10% of the worldwide disease burden, resulting in net savings of approximately US$ 72.7 billion each year until Millennium Development Goals for improved sanitation and drinking water are met 10. Although developing countries suffer disproportionately from enteric pathogen\u2010associated mortality and morbidity, illness due to enteric infections still has significant impacts on health and socioeconomics in developed countries with advanced wastewater and drinking water treatment 12, 14. Therefore, a primary, longstanding goal for protecting human health worldwide is accurate identification of the presence of wastewater pollution and prediction of risks to the public associated with contaminated drinking, shellfish harvesting, and recreational waters. Since the early 1900s, non\u2010pathogenic enteric bacteria (FIB; e.g. Enterococcus, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli) have been used throughout the world as indicators for the presence of enteric pathogens and have been utilized for subsequent prediction of human health risk due to microbial pathogens (Fig. 1B; 14, 15, 16, 17). The traditional monitoring approach for recreational water management depends upon routine monitoring of FIB using culture\u2010based methods and subsequent beach closures when FIB concentrations exceed allowable limits. FIB concentrations are also used to determine microbial quality of both treated and untreated wastewater and to calculate the associated health risks associated with reuse in agriculture 1. For example, the 2006 WHO guidelines suggest using quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA), with an assumed ratio of 0.1\u20131 human norovirus or rotavirus per 105\nE. coli, to calculate human health risk of viral infection from wastewater reuse in agriculture. Although this method is known to be flawed (see below), FIB are still widely used as an indicator of enteric pathogens and human health risks due to their consistent presence in wastewater and the readily available, low cost, culture\u2010based methods for detection that require minimal laboratory training 14, 15, 16, 17.",

            "text": "Despite their convenience and widespread use, it has been recognized since 1979 that FIB do not consistently correlate with the presence of enteric pathogens, particularly those that are not bacteria, or with human health risks in any water matrix (Table 1; 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). Even with the introduction of quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure FIB, the lack of a consistent correlation between FIB and human health risks continues to hold true in the majority of studies. One exception is a recent study that demonstrated a correlation between qPCR\u2010derived Enterococcus concentrations and the incidence of GI illness due to recreational activities at a beach exposed to point\u2010source wastewater pollution 18. The general lack of correlation between FIB and enteric viruses is not surprising due to differences in stability and persistence of these microbes. In comparison to enteric viruses, FIB are more susceptible to wastewater and drinking water treatment, are excreted by all warm\u2010blooded animals, and have higher die\u2010off rates in the environment, even though they can replicate and persist in the sediment after a contamination event (Fig. 1A). Drinking water, shellfish harvesting areas, recreational water, and wastewater designated for reuse that are considered safe based upon FIB concentrations can actually contain high concentrations of human enteric viruses 10, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21. Furthermore, FIB\u2010based QMRAs for wastewater reuse have been shown to greatly underestimate the risk of norovirus illness; in one study, actual norovirus concentrations were 1000\u2010fold greater than those predicted by the FIB\u2010norovirus ratio 21. The lack of an indicator to encompass all sources of fecal pollution and the heterogeneous distribution of FIB as well as their highly variable ratio with non\u2010bacterial pathogens in wastewater and environmental waters has significantly hindered improvements in microbial safety related to drinking water, wastewater reuse, shellfish consumption, and recreational waters 14, 15, 22.",

These holistic approaches incorporate sanitary surveys that inform water quality studies, which directly quantify reference pathogens (e.g. norovirus, rotavirus) and drive exploratory QMRA and subsequent management decisions 6, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24. Three main lines of evidence suggest that this approach will improve water quality monitoring efforts. First, the power of incorporating actual enteric virus measurements into exploratory QMRAs with multiple scenarios for driving site\u2010specific microbial safety guidelines for recreational waters was recently demonstrated 15. Similarly, the need to quantify enteric virus concentrations and resulting health risks was also highlighted to improve QMRAs for wastewater reuse and consequent public health guidelines 21. Finally, the utility of incorporating specific enteric viruses and/or a viral indicator to identify wastewater pollution/poor microbial quality and to better predict human health risks related to wastewater exposure has been demonstrated throughout the world 14, 15, 16, 22, 24, 25. Furthermore, improvements in microbial safety depend on improved treatment processes, enteric pathogen modeling, and QMRAs that directly measure reference enteric viruses and/or an improved viral indicator instead of relying upon FIB\u2010to\u2010model pathogen ratios 3, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24.",

Despite this challenge, viruses from the families Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae as well as the genera Anellovirus, Picobirnavirus, and Polyomavirus have been incorporated into water quality studies throughout the world 14, 16, 26. Additionally, several different bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), particularly F\u2010specific RNA coliphages, have been proposed as indicators for enteric viruses (reviewed in 22); however, none reliably correlate with the presence of enteric viruses in the environment or throughout disinfection processes 16, 17, 20, 25. The fairly consistent, relatively high concentrations of adenoviruses and polyomaviruses in wastewater make them possible indicator viruses (Table 1); however, their low concentrations in contaminated environments still present methodological difficulties for detection 3, 14, 16. Metagenomic studies have shown the dominance of plant viruses (family Virgaviridae) in human feces and wastewater 2, 5, 11, 27. Consequently, the use of a pepper plant pathogen, pepper mild mottle virus, has also been proposed as an alternative enteric virus indicator due to its high concentration in wastewater (average \u2265106 particles/mL) and dietary (i.e., human infection\u2010independent) origin in feces 14, 25, 26, 28.

The efficiency of virus isolation and concentration ranges widely, with values from 5 to 92% reported 26. While culture\u2010based methods can determine the concentration of infectious enteric viruses, they are expensive, laboratory intensive, yield delayed results, and fail to measure many waterborne viruses of concern (e.g. human norovirus, which has not yet been obtained in cell culture) 3, 26. For these reasons, molecular methods, particularly those that are quantitative, have become increasingly popular (Fig. 1C). The most common methods are amplification based and include: (reverse transcription) (RT\u2010) qPCR and nucleic acid sequence\u2010based amplification (NASBA) 29.",

Given that an appropriate enteric virus indicator has not been identified to date, investigators rely largely on pathogen\u2010specific molecular assays 14, 15, 24. However, poor method sensitivity is one the major limitations associated with using a human pathogen as an indicator for enteric viruses. Improvements in virus concentration methods or the use of an indicator that is found in higher concentrations (e.g. pepper mild mottle virus) could alleviate these problems. Other limitations of qPCR and NASBA include laboratory time, expense of equipment and reagents, co\u2010concentration of inhibitors (e.g. humics, organics), target virus selection, primer specificity, proper standards and controls. Standards exist for the correct interpretation of qPCR results; however, these guidelines are not widely used among water quality studies 30.

This is particularly true for developing countries that have poor sanitation coverage, lack safe drinking water, and rely on wastewater reuse in agriculture 1, 12. Despite the inadequacy of FIB to predict human health outcomes, lab\u2010free, user friendly, relatively inexpensive FIB culture\u2010based methods exist for different water matrices (IDEXX Laboratories, USA; AguaGenX, LLC, USA). Over the last decade, advancements in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of immunostrip tests (dipstick tests similar in format to a pregnancy test) for the detection of a variety of targets, including human viruses (reviewed in 31). Furthermore, other immuno\u2010based rapid detection tests for norovirus (evaluated by 32) and even simpler, more affordable tests for the detection of Salmonella Typhi via a flow\u2010through membrane immunoassay platform have been developed 33.
