In the same countries antimicrobial usage in veal calves has been found to exceed that of pig, poultry, dairy and beef cattle production (Pardon et al., 2012a, Bondt et al., 2013). An explanation may be that producers of pigs and poultry receive animals from a limited number of suppliers, while veal calf producers typically purchase calves from numerous dairy herds. A large number of suppliers, new feed and stress related to the transport and commingling of new animals exposes veal calves to a high risk of disease and may explain the higher use of antimicrobials (Pardon et al., 2012a).",

Some of the calves are slaughtered as veal (8\u201312 months of age) (EU Regulation EC, 2007), while some are slaughtered as young bulls (>12 months of age) (Danish Agriculture and Food Council, 2016). In 2014, around 200,000 veal and young bulls were slaughtered in Denmark (Danish Agriculture and Food Council, 2015). Heifers only make up around 1% of the total number of produced calves (SEGES, 2016). After arrival in a specialized veal calf herd, the calves receive calf milk replacer until around 8 weeks of age, after which they are typically fed on a ration of grain and concentrate or on a total mixed ration based on corn silage. The calves are predominantly Danish Holsteins, though a small percentage of them are Holstein crossbreds. Specialized Danish ros\u00e9 veal calf producers generally keep the calves in compartments of multiple straw-bedded pens or cubicles, where each unit may hold 6\u201350 calves of the same age, depending on the producer. Typically, an all-in-all-out production is implemented at pen level, but not at compartment level. Depending on the facilities, this may result in calves of different ages being housed under the same roof, thus facilitating the transmission of airborne pathogens (Mars et al., 1999, Niskanen and Lindberg, 2003).",

Antimicrobials were quantified as the number of Animal Daily Doses (ADD200) (Jensen et al., 2004). Based on the official Danish quantification of antimicrobials, we used a standard weight of 200 kg for calves (personal communication Erik Jacobsen, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration). The standard dose, ADD200 corresponds to the treatment of one 200 kg calf for one day. For comparison between herds, the amount of antimicrobials was standardized in agreement with the official unit as the number of Animal Daily Doses per 100 calves per day (ADD200/100 calves/day). This unit approximates the percentage of calves treated daily at the herd assuming that all calves weigh 200 kg (Anon., 2014). Based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, antimicrobial products were grouped according to active substance as amphenicols, combination products (all except sulphonamide/trimethoprim and lincospectin), macrolides, sulphonamide/trimethoprim, tetracyclines, simple or extended-spectrum penicillin products, lincospectin, lincosamides, cephalosporin, aminoglycosides and colistin. The products were further characterized as intended for parenteral or oral use, based on the definitions in VetStat. Clinical indication according to diagnostic grouping in VetStat (Stege et al., 2003) was categorized as gastrointestinal, respiratory, joint/limbs/Central Nervous System (CNS) or other disorders (covering the three VetStat diagnostic groups reproduction, udder and metabolism as well as missing disorders). In addition, information about registered vaccines against respiratory disorders was extracted.",

This VetStat category includes a number of various disorders which clinically are not related, e.g. omphalitis, arthritis, otitis media and interdigital phlegmon. Based on VetStat registrations, it is not possible to specify which clinical conditions registered drugs are supposed to target. Arthritis is more prevalent in young calves, while interdigital phlegmon typically is seen in older calves >240 days of age. Hence, a large amount of antimicrobials may be used for the latter, but only cover a relatively small number of treatments due to the treatment of heavier cattle (Ortman and Svensson, 2004). Pardon et al. (2013) found otitis and arthritis to represent 1.5% and 1.6% of the initial causes of antimicrobial treatment, which can be explained by a high prevalence of Mycoplasma bovis. M. bovis is highly prevalent among veal calves in Europe (Arcangioli et al., 2008, Radaelli et al., 2008, Pardon et al., 2013) and North America (Soehnlen et al., 2012). Recently, M. bovis has also been found in Danish veal calf herds (Nielsen, 2016) and may be responsible for a proportion of the treatments of joints/limbs/CNS and respiratory disorders in young calves. Mycoplasmas are innate resistant to penicillin (Taylor-Robinson and B\u00e9b\u00e9ar, 1997), which may explain the relatively low use of penicillin (Fig. 2).",

Only 14.6% were administered orally, in contrast to white veal calf production in Switzerland (84.6%) (Lava et al., 2016b) and Belgium (95.8%) (Pardon et al., 2012a). An explanation of this difference in administration routes may be found in the feeding. Shortage on roughage for white veal calves reduces ruminal development to a well-functioning fermentative process, enabling oral administration of antimicrobials. The official Danish guidelines on antimicrobial treatment of cattle merely recommend oral administration of antimicrobials for gastrointestinal disorders of calves, such as Escherichia coli infections in preweaned calves. Caution against oral administration is based on limited absorption, as well as side effects for the intestinal flora (SEGES Dairy and Beef Research Centre et al., 2013). Additionally, oral administration of antimicrobials has been found associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance (Bos et al., 2012, Burow et al., 2014). Despite the allocation of oral antimicrobial treatments for gastrointestinal disorders, the majority of oral treatments were registered for respiratory disorders (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Large variation was seen in antimicrobial usage between herd types (Fig. 3). As the majority of treatments is targeted respiratory disorders in the beginning of the fattening period (Pardon et al., 2012b), starter and full-line herds are expected to house the majority of diseased calves. In full-line herds, treatment of disease in the beginning of the production period is evened out by a longer time in the herd, which may explain the significantly lower use of antimicrobials compared to starter herds. Compared to Danish pig herds, Danish veal calf and young bull producing herds seem to use less antimicrobials. As shown in Fig. 3, the median standardized usage of antimicrobials (ADD200/100 animals/day) was 2.14 in starter herds, 0.48 in finisher herds, 0.78 in full-line herds and 0.62 in herds with inconsistent movements. The median use of antimicrobials in Danish pig herds in 2012\u20132013 was around 8.0 for weaners, 0.8 for finishers and 1.8 for sows (Fertner et al., 2015). This higher usage in weaner pigs may be explained three main factors, Firstly, the indication of treatment differed, with gastrointestinal disorders being the primarily indication for treatment in pigs (Jensen et al., 2014), while respiratory disorders dominated in large veal calf and young bull producing herds. Secondly, pigs are categorized into more age-groups, which imply the standard weights for pigs being closer to the actual weight at treatment (15 kg (weaners), 50 kg (finishers) and 200 kg (sows/piglets)) compared to veal calves and young bulls (200 kg), where the applied standard weight is higher than the expected weight at treatment. Thirdly, the higher turn-over of pigs, where finishers are slaughtered at the average age of 5\u20136 months (Danish Agriculture and Food Council, 2014) may explain a higher usage.",

We assumed that all registered drugs for a given age group on a given herd were actually consumed by that group of animals at the point in time where the drugs were purchased. This is most likely not the case. However, due to the long study period (one year) we expect irregularities in purchase patterns to be evened out to reflect an averagely actual usage.",

(2016a) reported the purchase of veal calves to increase mortality, unwanted early slaughter and the application of metaphylaxis. Taylor et al. (2010) further reported purchase of calves from markets as a risk factor of respiratory disease. As demonstrated in our results, relatively few calves were sold on markets or through delivering traders in Denmark, which may explain, why we did not see an effect of these factors on the amounts of antimicrobial used.

            "text": "Registration of purchased vaccines against BRSV, PI-3 and Mannheimia haemolytica serotype A1 was not found to influence the amount of antimicrobials. Due to the limited amount of herds using vaccines, we chose to dichotomize the variable in the risk factor analysis, as usage or not. A part of the insignificance may be explained by the limitations in our data. We only evaluated the effect on vaccination in the veal calf and young bull producing herd and not in the supplying dairy herd. Neither did we evaluate the administration procedure. An optimal vaccination program would require the supplying dairy herd manager to administer the vaccine 2\u20133 weeks prior to delivery in order to ensure sufficient immunoresponse at the time of arrival in the veal calf herd (Cusack et al., 2003). Another explanation of the insignificance may be found in the variety of pathogens. In Denmark, the most prevalent pathogens isolated from severe outbreaks of calf pneumonia in mono- or multi-culture include BRSV, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somnus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Trueperella pyogenes (Tegtmeier et al., 1999), Bovine coronavirus (Liu et al., 2006) and recently M. bovis (Nielsen, 2016), while PI-3 seems to play a minor role (Tegtmeier et al., 1999). Hence, a range of other pathogens may be involved in respiratory disorders than those three included in the vaccine. Cusack et al. (2003) did also not find any effect of vaccination on the prevalence of respiratory disorders and attribute the non-significance to the possibility of multiple pathogens being involved in the infection, making it infeasible to vaccinate against all.",

Treatment incidences in these two studies were not comparable to our results due to two issues: The lack of standardized standard dosages and the lack of standardized standard weights. Approved dosages of products with identical active substance and administration route have been found to differ almost four-fold between countries and up to ten-fold within the same country (Postma et al., 2015). Likewise, a consensus on approved standard weight is lacking. Previous publications have suggested or applied standard weights of 164 kg (Pardon et al., 2012a, Lava et al., 2016a, Lava et al., 2016b), 140 kg (European Medicines Agency, 2015) and 172 kg (MARAN, 2016). Considering the large differences between white and ros\u00e9 veal calves, it might be worthwhile to differentiate standard weights as done in the Netherlands (white (160 kg), ros\u00e9 starter (77.5 kg) and ros\u00e9 finisher (232.5 kg)) (Bos et al., 2013).",
