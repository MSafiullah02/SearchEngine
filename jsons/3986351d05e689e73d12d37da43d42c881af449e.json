Most general hospital wards have ventilation systems that drive air and thus contaminants from the patient areas towards the corridors. This study investigates the transport mechanism and deposition patterns of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) within a typical six bedded general inpatient ward cubicle through numerical simulation. It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient's bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. The outcome of this study can serve as a source of reference for hospital management to better ventilation design strategies for mitigating the risk of infection.

As inpatient care facilities such as general medical and surgical hospitals are used by patients, healthcare workers and visitors simultaneously, the susceptibility of these people to hospitalacquired infections (HAIs) or nosocomial infections is reasonably high (Giannini et al. 2009 ). The largest nosocomial outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong, China and the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korean hospitals have had substantial morbidity and mortality (Oh et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2015) . The three widely known transmission routes of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza viruses are close contact, long-range airborne and fomite (Xiao et al. 2018) . Although close contact is generally regarded as the possible transmission route of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zumla et al. 2015) , studies have indicated that airborne and fomite are other possible modes of MERS-CoV transmission (Kim et al. 2016; Van Doremalen et al. 2013) . There is also sufficient evidence to support that an association exists between ventilation strategies and dissemination of nosocomial pathogens in indoor environments . Hence, it is essential to revise and update current ventilation design strategies to contain potential outbreaks caused by novel emerging viruses in the future.",

Most general hospital wards have ventilation systems that drive air from the patient areas to the circulation areas. Airborne pathogens can thus spread from a ward cubicle to the rest of the ward and lead to a potential for nosocomial outbreaks. Although it is widely assumed that increasing the air change rate (ACH) can reduce infection risks, it was shown that the risk of exposure to pathogens could increase with an increased ventilation rate under certain circumstances BUILD SIMUL https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-020-0623-4 Satheesan et al. / Building Simulation 2 (Bolashikov et al. 2012; Pantelic and Tham 2013) . Several studies have also emphasized that apart from ACH, the design of a ventilation system is a determinant controlling contaminant flow paths (Ghia et al. 2012; Licina et al. 2015; Memarzadeh and Xu 2012; Pantelic and Tham 2013) . As there is a paucity of guidelines or strategies for general ward ventilation (Beggs et al. 2008; Chaudhury et al. 2005; Roy and Milton 2004) , a review of present nosocomial infection control practices for presumably low risk zones and unprotected areas such as a general ward is all-important (Humphreys 2006; Wan et al. 2007) .",

With the advent of improved turbulence modelling and computing power, the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to indoor environment simulation has been on an increasing trend (Nielsen 2015) . Under varied operating conditions in an indoor environment with high temporal and spatial resolution, CFD numerical simulation techniques provide insights into the overall airflow and bioaerosol distribution (Chao et al. 2008; . In fact, CFD techniques have been used to estimate ventilation effectiveness for contaminant removal in healthcare facilities. As the number of research studies on ventilation systems for general inpatient wards with respect to air change rate and exhaust airflow rate is limited, this study evaluates the combined impacts of these two parameters on the airflow as well as infection risk distributions of droplet nuclei of size 0.167 \u03bcm (i.e. MERS-CoV) within an air-conditioned general inpatient ward cubicle. Moreover, a simple yet cost-effective ventilation system design that can minimize the risk of infection in an existing hospital ward is proposed.",

            "text": "The airflow distribution and the transport mechanisms of bioaerosols in the ward cubicle were investigated using a finite volume based CFD code (Ansys Fluent 13.0). The numerical simulation model consists of a continuum phase (air) and a discrete phase (droplet nuclei). In this study, the governing equations of continuity, momentum and energy for the continuum phase were based on an Eulerian framework, and the discrete phase was modelled by a Lagrangian framework (Wong et al. 2010 ). The threedimensional airflow was modelled as a steady-state incompressible turbulent flow. CFD possess miscellaneous number of turbulence models, although it is very difficult to pinpoint one turbulence model that outperforms others for all class of problems. Hence, the turbulence model selection is a compromise based on factors such as flow physics involved, established practice for predicting a particular set of problem, computational resources, accuracy level and simulation time (Gao and Niu 2005) . Numerous studies on turbulent indoor airflow have been carried out through Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations, whereas for some case studies large eddy scale simulations (LES) have been preferred to provide accurate prediction of flow field variables. However, LES demands much higher grid requirements as well as computational time compared to RANS, which makes RANS widely used (Blocken 2018) . The Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation greatly reduces the complexity involved in the simulation of turbulent flows. The equations have time averaged flow field variables which would eliminate the turbulent fluctuations. Although, this simplification leads to the creation of additional Reynolds stress tensors which are unknowns within the equation and leads to closure issues. The Eddy viscosity turbulence modelling provides closure to equations and the most preferred eddy viscosity turbulence model to simulate the indoor airflow distribution is the renormalization group (RNG) k-\u03b5. The RNG k-\u03b5 model, was chosen to model the air turbulence in this study, as it offers better accuracy, stability and computing efficiency for low reynolds number as well as near wall flows (Chen 1995; Zhang and Chen 2006; ). The diffuser inlets were defined as velocity-inlet, while corridor and exhaust grilles were treated as outflow boundary condition. Ansys Fluent treats outflow boundaries as having zero diffusion flux for all flow variables as well as it incorporates an overall mass balance correction. Furthermore, outflow with flow rate weighting option enables the user to have multiple outflow boundaries with fractional flow rate through each boundary (ANSYS 2010). A second-order upwind scheme was applied to discretize the governing equations while the SIMPLE algorithm was used for the pressurevelocity coupling in the continuum phase. The metabolic rate of a reclining patient was assumed to be 0.8 MET (ASHRAE 2013b) and half of the heat (23.3 W\u00b7m \u22122 ) from each patient is assumed to be transferred through convection (Qian and Li 2010; Hang et al. 2014) . A constant heat flux thermal boundary condition was uniformly imposed on the whole surfaces of the supine patients (Shen et al. 2013) . Apart from walls of heat sources (patients), all other walls were treated as adiabatic. Smooth no-slip condition is applied at all walls. In order to reduce modelling complexity arising from density differences due to temperature gradients, the Boussinesq approximation was employed (Zeytounian 2003) .",

ICEM-CFD 13.0 was utilized to generate hexahedral mesh for these individual computational cell zones. The individual mesh files are then merged together using the tmerge filter functionality. In tmerge, before the individual meshes are combined together to one mesh file, the required scaling factor, translation distance and rotation information of the meshes is specified. With the existence of non-identical mesh node locations as shown in Fig. 2 along the boundaries of the individual cell zones of the computational domain, non-conformal interfaces are established between individual cell zones. These interfaces connect each cell zones by transferring fluxes from one mesh to another (ANSYS 2010). The first cell height from wall is kept at a distance of 0.001 m and grid spacing of 1.2 is maintained throughout the domain. The near-wall mesh was made fine enough to resolve the viscous sublayer (y + < 5) and the near-wall modelling was done through the enhanced wall treatment approach. The Three grid systems, namely 1002k (System1), 3202k (System 2) and 5110k (System 3), Fig. 2 Non-identical mesh nodes along the boundary of two cell zones were created for the grid convergence study and airflow simulations were performed on each grid. To analyse the convergence of the three grid systems, the grid convergence index (GCI) concept was applied (Roache 1998; Wong et al. 2010) . The root mean square of the relative error (e rms ) for the fluid flow mean velocities (u) detected at 100 points along a vertical line in the centre of the ward cubicle was used to determine the GCIs for the grid systems.",

Although the magnitudes of these forces are greatly influenced by the fluid flow conditions and particle properties, a few of these forces are small enough to be neglected in some analyses (Zhao et al. 2004 ). Due to the particle size and non-isothermal flow conditions in this study, Brownian, thermophorectic and Saffman lift forces were taken into consideration for predicting the particle motion trajectories. The dispersion of particles as a consequence of turbulence in the flow field can be tracked through stochastic tracking methods. The discrete random walk (DRW) model, a popular approach that takes velocity fluctuations into account, was employed in this study (Lai et al. 2012) . Further details for the CFD simulations are summarized in Table 1 .",

Figure 3 depicts the air velocity distribution and velocity vector plot across a horizontal plane located at y = 1.0 m for the base case, i.e. a typical ward cubicle without exhaust grilles. In Fig. 3(a) , stagnant air with velocity less than 0.05 m\u00b7s \u22121 is observed near wall 2 and Fig. 3(b) depicts that the overall airflow pattern in the cubicle is directed towards the ward corridor. These results are consistent with those presented in our previous case study (Yu et al. 2017 ). Due to the existence of obstructions such as patients and beds, several eddies can be seen within the ward cubicle. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the temperature distribution as well as velocity vector plot across a vertical plane located at z = 1.625 m for an air change rate of 6 h \u22121 and 9 h \u22121 with EA = 50% respectively. As the thermal manikins cause thermal plumes, the effect of thermal plumes on the ward airflow pattern can be clearly seen from the vertical airflow distribution. There is an upward airflow (towards the ward ceiling) that returns to the floor level along the walls. Recirculation zones, which may occur when the cold supply air from the diffusers interacts with the upward airflow caused by the thermal plumes, are observed. These zones can enhance the mixing of air within the ward space. Moreover, the suction provided by the local exhaust grilles tends to alter the airflow pattern around a patient and thus can help to remove airborne contaminants in the immediate vicinity of the patient.",

According to Fig. 6 , there were considerable amounts of virus particles on different cubicle surfaces including walls, floor and ceiling. A maximum r c (\u2248 0.26), resulted from the supine patients and their exhaled air velocities, can be seen at 3 h \u22121 in Fig. 6(a) . It can also be seen in the figure that r c decreases as the air change rate increases (e.g. r c \u2248 0.17 at 6 h \u22121 (a 34% decrease) and r c \u2248 0.11 at 13 h \u22121 (a 57% decrease)). In fact, the air supplied through the diffusers has a higher momentum with an increased air change rate and it moves the particles away from the ceiling to other spaces within the cubicle. As depicted in Figs. 6(b) and (c), r w and r f were respectively greater than 0.07 and 0.03 in the base case for all air change rates. As shown in Fig. 7(a) , patients in beds located at 1.625 m away from the corridor (i.e. Patients 1 and 2) were most vulnerable to cross infection (with exposure risk (E) > 0.05) while those at 5.875 m away (i.e. Patients 5 and 6) were least (with E < 0.025). With an increase in air change rate, a significant reduction in infection risk was observed for patients located farther away from the corridor. This can be explained by the general airflow patterns as illustrated in Fig. 3 . On average, the infection risk level of Patients 5 and 6 was only half of that of Patients 1 and 2 for all air change rates.",

Figures 7(b) and (c) indicate that the installation of exhaust grilles in close proximity to each patient can help prevent particle migration from an infected patient to different locations in the ward and significantly reduce individual patient exposures (E < 0.05). The results show that the location of an infected patient, exhaust airflow rates and air change rates within the cubicle work together influencing the mechanism of viral spread.",

From r e < 0.05 at 3 h \u22121 to r e > 0.25 at 13 h \u22121 , an abrupt increase in risk (80%) was noted for these patients. At higher air change rates, specifically at 13 h \u22121 , the number of particles reaching the corridor due to the exhalation activities of Patients 5 and 6 located at the rear end of the ward (i.e. 5.875 m away from corridor) was quite high (0.05 < r e < 0.1). This suggests that the use of a high air change rate such as 13 h \u22121 can put the users of the corridor and its connected amenities at high risk of exposure to pathogens and facilitate infectious disease outbreaks in the whole healthcare facility.",

Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient's bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. Installation of UVGI lamps in the ward space is recommended to further enhance the risk mitigation strategies.
