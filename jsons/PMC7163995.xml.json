The swine testis (ST) cell line, which is highly susceptible to TGEV infection, provides a useful model to study the internalization mechanism of TGEVs.3\n",

In addition, the detailed kinetic information over the entire process could also be obtained from single\u2010virus tracking analysis.11, 12 This approach has already been used to reveal the internalization mechanism of many viruses such as influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human immunodeficiency virus.13, 14, 15 Therefore, single\u2010virus tracking provides previously unavailable information about the dynamics of endocytic processes and is particularly well suited to address how viruses are targeted to endocytic mechanism.",

Untreated ST cells infected with the same amount of TGEVs were used as the control. Finally, the cells were fixed and the infected TGEVs were stained with anti\u2010TGEV polyclonal antibody and FITC\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG for observation. According to Figure 2A, less infected TGEVs were observed in the CPZ treated ST cells compared to the control ST cells, revealing that CPZ significantly but not completely inhibited the TGEV internalization into ST cells. In order to quantify the CPZ effect on TGEV infection, ST cells were treated with different CPZ concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50 \u00b5M, and infected with the same amount of TGEVs. The relative TGEV levels were measured by qPCR in Figure 2B, indicating that higher CPZ concentration significantly reduced the TGEV infectivity. Moreover, pitstop 2, which is a selective inhibitor of clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis that acts via blocking ligand access to the clathrin terminal domain,21 significantly inhibited the TGEV internalization (Figure S1A). Transferrin uptake assays indicated that CPZ and pitstop 2 successfully inhibited the clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis (Figure S1B). In addition, the co\u2010localization experiments showed that the TGEV particles were markedly co\u2010localized with clathrin (Figure S1E,F), suggesting that clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis is important for TGEV internalization. The above results further confirm that TGEVs can be internalized into the host cells via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis.",

            "text": "To further investigate the dynamic TGEV internalization via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, single\u2010virus tracking was adopted using the fluorescence confocal microscope (Nikon A1, Tokyo, Japan). The TGEVs were labeled with DiD, and a fusion protein of clathrin light chain B and enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clc\u2010EGFP) was expressed in the ST cells to observe the clathrin\u2010coated structures (CCSs), which were generated by recruiting clathrin from cytoplasm on the cell membrane. Figure 2C depicts the typical dynamic motions of three individual TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells. All these time\u2010lapse images show that the TGEVs first moved slowly in local regions; afterward, they significantly accelerated and moved rapidly through large distances. Moreover, there was no clathrin around the TGEVs in the beginning, then the clathrin gradually appeared with the TGEVs, and finally the clathrin around the TGEVs disappeared. Furthermore, we define entry as the time point at which the particle velocity of TGEV begins to increase, that is, the virus leaves the cell membrane and enters the cell. Analyzed from 38 TGEVs entries via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, the statistical results show that the time duration from the beginning of recruitment of Clc to TGEV entry is 86.42 \u00b1 17.30 seconds. Meanwhile, according to Figures 2C and S2A, the TGEV internalization via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis could be completed within 2 minutes of warm\u2010up. In order to analyze these dynamic motions in details, both the TGEV velocities and the clathrin fluorescence intensities were extracted as shown in Figure 2D. The TGEVs moved slowly with the velocities of 0.076/0.079/0.108 \u03bcm/s, and their velocities rapidly increased to 0.907/0.952/0.912 \u03bcm/s. In addition, the clathrin fluorescence signals gradually increased and then nearly plateaued when the TGEV velocities were low, indicating the generation and the gradual maturation of the clathrin\u2010coated pits (CCPs). The subsequent drastic decline and the eventual disappearance of the clathrin fluorescence signals occurred with the TGEV acceleration, demonstrating that the TGEVs were successfully encapsulated into clathrin\u2010coated vesicles (CCVs) and internalized into the ST cells, followed by the rapid uncoating of the CCVs only within a few seconds. By analyzing the TGEV velocities and the clathrin fluorescence signals, the TGEV motions can be separated into two stages as shown in Figure 2E. Additionally, the TGEV motions were also studied using mean square displacement (MSD). It is found that the TGEVs first experienced anomalous diffusion during the assembly of CCPs on the cell membrane (Figure 2F); and then the rapid motions of TGEVs were in directed diffusion (Figure 2G), suggesting that the TGEVs were successfully internalized into the ST cells. Both the results in Figure 2E\u2010G illustrate that the TGEVs first recruited clathrin to form vesicles\u2010containing viruses and then entered into the ST cells.",

Afterward, the ST cells were fixed and the internalized TGEVs were stained with anti\u2010TGEV polyclonal antibody and FITC\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG for observation as shown in Figure 3A. It is found that nystatin significantly inhibited the TGEV internalization compared to the control group. Furthermore, to quantify the nystatin effect on TGEV infection, ST cells were treated with different nystatin concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50 \u00b5M, and infected with the same amount of TGEVs. The relative TGEV levels measured by qPCR in Figure 3B illustrate that the TGEV infection could be significantly reduced with higher nystatin concentrations. Moreover, methyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), which can deplete cholesterol to inhibit caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis,24 significantly inhibited the TGEV internalization (Figure S1C). Cholera toxin beta subunit (CTB) uptake assays indicated that nystatin and M\u03b2CD successfully inhibited the caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis (Figure S1D). In addition, the co\u2010localization experiments showed that the TGEV particles were markedly co\u2010localized with Cav1 (Figure S1E,G), suggesting that caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis is important for TGEV internalization.

Figure 3C depicts the typical dynamics of three TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells. Furthermore, results of 17 TGEV entries via caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis show that the average duration from the beginning of recruitment of Cav1 to TGEV entry is 88.56 \u00b1 19.31 seconds, and according to Figures 3C and S2\nB, the TGEV internalization via caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis could be finished within 2 minutes of warm\u2010up. Figure 3D shows the TGEV velocities and the caveolae fluorescence signals extracted from Figure 3C. Similar to the case of TGEV internalization via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis, the TGEV velocities were rather low as 0.078/0.065/0.079 \u03bcm/s at first but significantly accelerated to 0.937/0.932/0.913 \u03bcm/s after 96/75/111 seconds. Moreover, according to the fluorescence signals, caveolae gradually increased and then maintained stable in the low TGEV velocity stage, but finally disappeared after the TGEVs reached fast velocities. Therefore, the TGEV internalization via caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis can also be separated into two stages shown in Figure 3E as the trajectories and Figure 3F,G as the MSD. In the first stage, the TGEVs were attached to the cell membrane with rather low speed in anomalous motion mode accompanied with the generation and the gradual maturation of caveolae; while in the second stage, these TGEVs successfully entered into the ST cells with accelerated velocities in directed motion mode but with the disappearance of caveolae.",

Additionally, Figure 5D shows the TGEV velocities and the actin fluorescence signals extracted from Figure 5C. Actin around the TGEVs gradually increased and maintained with rather high levels when the TGEVs performed rather low velocities as 0.067/0.105/0.099 \u03bcm/s; after 114/81/63 seconds, actin around the TGEVs rapidly decreased as TGEVs accelerated to 0.913/0.931/0.956 \u03bcm/s, both synchronizing with the TGEV internalization via clathrin\u2010 and caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis.
