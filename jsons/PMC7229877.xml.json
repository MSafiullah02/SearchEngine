First, the FCV-19S was translated into Arabic by an independent professional medical translator who is fluent in English and Arabic. Second, one of the authors, who is fluent in English and Arabic, reviewed the provisional Arabic translation and discussed any anomalies with the independent translator. Third, the approved Arabic translation draft of the scale was then back translated into English by another author who at this time was unfamiliar with the original English scale. Both the forward and backward translations of the scale were then compared for equivalence and checked for cultural appropriateness among the authors. The approved Arabic translation was then piloted with 20 people recruited on Twitter to examine the scale readability and potential ambiguity. There were no apparent problems, and no further changes were deemed necessary. The final Arabic version of the FCV-19S can be found in the Appendix.",

Each item is rated on a 4-point scale. After reverse scoring six items (2 for anxiety and 4 for depression), relevant item scores are added to produce HADS-A and HADS-D total scores, with possible total scores ranging from 0 to 21 for each subscale. Additionally, an overall total score (HADS-T) can also be calculated by summing all items (0\u201342 range), with higher scores indicating greater levels of psychological distress (Zigmond and Snaith 1983). The HADS has demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties in different patient groups as well as in general populations (Bjelland et al. 2002; Mykletun et al. 2001). The Arabic version of the HADS has also shown acceptable psychometric properties (Terkawi et al. 2017). Internal consistency in the current study was \u03b1 = .86 for the HADS-A, \u03b1 = .80 for the HADS-D, and \u03b1 = .90 for the whole scale.",

Inter-item correlations and corrected item-total correlations between .30 and .70 suggest medium to strong associations between items (Ferketich 1991).

Internal consistency of the Arabic FCV-19S was .88, which is marginally higher than that reported for the original scale (\u03b1 = .82) (Ahorsu et al. 2020), and Italian (\u03b1 = .87) (Soraci et al. 2020), Bangla (\u03b1 = .87) (Sakib et al. 2020), and Turkish (\u03b1 = .85) versions (Satici et al. 2020). Concurrent validity analysis showed significant positive correlations with anxiety and depression as assessed by the HADS, and this was also consistent with previous findings (Ahorsu et al. 2020; Sakib et al. 2020; Satici et al. 2020; Soraci et al. 2020).",

However, items 3, 6, and 7 had lower mean values compared with the rest of the items, indicating that respondents tended to strongly disagree with these statements. This was also the case among Italian (Soraci et al. 2020), Turkish (Satici et al. 2020) and Bangladeshi respondents (Sakib et al. 2020) but not Iranian respondents (Ahorsu et al. 2020). Item 3, 6, and 7 have shared meaning in that they all refer to somatic aspects related to COVID-19 fear (clammy hands, lack of sleep, heart racing). However, there was not enough evidence for these items to form a separate factor, as inter-item correlations did not indicate a clearly distinguishable factor, and the misfit in model 1 could be adequately resolved by correlating shared error variance between these items.",

Another study reported that greater fear of COVID-19 was associated reduced physical and environmental quality of life (which is unsurprising given that people are in lockdown) and improved social distancing and hand hygiene practices, suggesting that fear plays an important role in motivating people to comply with COVID-19-related recommended health behaviors (Harper et al. 2020).",

Future research could also investigate how fear of COVID-19 affects the extent to which people practice social distancing, hand washing, and other public health measures within COVID-19 context. Our findings should be viewed in light of some limitations. The snowball sampling method used during the lockdown and quarantine measures, put in place by the Government, may have introduced selection bias, where only those who received the study link had the chance to participate. Moreover, although recruitment of participants through LinkedIn was low compared with other social media platforms, LinkedIn could be considered as a niche social media platform. This might have produced a subsample of biased participants in terms of socio-demographics. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that the Arabic FCV-19S has a unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties and hence can be used in research assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among the Saudi adult population.",
