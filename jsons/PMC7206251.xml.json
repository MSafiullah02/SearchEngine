Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most popular tools for arrhythmia diagnosis. To manually handle long ECG recordings with thousands of heartbeats, clinicians have to determine the class of each heartbeat to detect arrhythmias, which is highly costly. Therefore, great efforts have been made to create computer-aided diagnosis tools that can detect irregular heartbeats automatically.\n",

Among them, most methods work in three steps: preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation and beat-wise classification (see Sect. 2). The preprocessing step removes various kinds of noise from raw signals, the heartbeat segmentation step identifies individual heartbeats, and the beat-wise classification step classifies each heartbeat. This methodology has the following drawbacks: First, explicit heartbeat segmentation can undermine model simplicity and compactness. Traditional heartbeat segmentation methods explicitly extract ECG features for QRS detection. Since deep learning methods can produce feature maps from raw data, heartbeat segmentation can be simultaneously conducted with classification with a single neural network. Second, beat-wise classification uses isolated heartbeats, which risks losing inter-heartbeat context information that can be useful to boosting classification performance.",

They do not explicitly utilize context information among heartbeats. By contrast, Mousavi et al. [14] proposed a sequence-to-sequence LSTM based model which maps a sequence of heartbeats in time order to a sequence of labels, where context dependencies are captured by the cell state of the network. Hannun et al. [15] proposed a 33-layer neural network for arrhythmia detection which maps ECG data to a sequence of labels. However, the precise regions of arrhythmias cannot be obtained. Oh et al. [16] used a modified U-net to identify regions of heartbeats and the background from raw signals, yet this method needs extra steps to detect arrhythmias from the generated annotation. Several researches applies Faster R-CNN to ECG analysis. For example, Ji et al. [17] proposed a heartbeat classification framework based on Faster R-CNN. 1-D heartbeats extracted from original signals are converted to images as the input of the model. Sophisticated preprocessing is required before classification. He et al. [18] and Yu et al. [19] use Faster R-CNN to perform heartbeat segmentation and QRS complex detection. In our method, we present a modified Faster R-CNN for arrhythmia detection which works in only two steps: preprocessing, and simultaneous heartbeat segmentation and classification.",

Here we applied SMOTE [27] for data augmentation as it was also used in our baselines. Figure 5 shows the results. Our model achieves an accuracy of 99.6%, a sensitivity of 99.75% and a specificity of 99.6%. These results are similar to those obtained by [14] which used a LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model to learn context information. The difference between our work and [14] is that we learn context information from raw signals while [14] did so using a sequence of individual heartbeats. Besides, the LSTM-based model has lower efficiency. Compared to other baselines which perform classification on individual heartbeat, our model has a simpler model structure but achieves similar or better results on some metrics, highlighting the power of context-awareness.",
