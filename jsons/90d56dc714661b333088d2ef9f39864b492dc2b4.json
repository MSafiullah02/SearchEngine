However, the inverse problem of backward diffusion is known to be ill-posed and straightforward numerical algorithms are unstable. So far, existing stabilisation strategies in the literature require sophisticated numerics to solve the underlying initial value problem. Therefore, it is desirable to establish a backward diffusion model which implements a smart stabilisation approach that can be used in combination with a simple numerical scheme. We derive a class of space-discrete one-dimensional backward diffusion as gradient descent of energies where we gain stability by imposing range constraints. Interestingly, these energies are even convex. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive theory for the time-continuous evolution and we show that stability carries over to a simple explicit time discretisation of our model. Finally, we confirm the stability and usefulness of our technique in experiments in which we enhance the contrast of digital greyscale and colour images. (2010):",

            "text": "Backward parabolic differential equations also enjoy high popularity in the image analysis community where they have e.g. been used for image restoration and image deblurring respectively. The first contribution to backward diffusion dates back to 1955 when Kov\u00e1sznay and Joseph [28] proposed to use the scaled negative Laplacian for contour enhancement. Gabor [14] observed that the isotropy of the Laplacian operator leads to amplification of accidental noise at contour lines at the same time it enhances the contour lines. As a remedy, he proposed to restrict the contrast enhancement to the orthogonal contour direction and -in a second stepsuggested additional smoothing in tangent direction. Lindenbaum et al. [29] make use of averaged derivatives in order to improve the directional sensitive filter by Gabor. However, the authors point out that smoothing in only one direction favours the emergence of artefacts in nearly isotropic image regions. They recommend to use the Perona-Malik filter [40] instead. Forces of Perona-Malik type are also used by Pollak et al. [43] who specify a family of evolution equations to sharpen edges and suppress noise in the context of image segmentation. In [50], ter Haar Romeny et al. stress the influence of higher order time derivatives on the Gaussian deblurred image. Referring to the heat equation, the authors express the time derivatives in the spatial domain and approximate them using Gaussian derivatives. Steiner et al. [47] highlight how backward diffusion can be used for feature enhancement in planar curves.",

This is e.g. implemented in the inverse diffusion filter of Osher and Rudin [38] . It imposes zero diffusivities at extrema and applies backward diffusion everywhere else. The socalled forward-and-backward (FAB) diffusion of Gilboa et al. [19] follows a slightly different approach. Closely related to the Perona-Malik filter [40] it uses negative diffusivities for a specific range of gradient magnitudes. On the other hand, it imposes forward diffusion for values of low and zero gradient magnitude. By doing so, the filter prevents the output values from exploding at extrema. However, it is worth mentioning that -so far -all adequate implementations of inverse diffusion processes with forward or zero diffusivities at extrema require sophisticated numerical schemes [38, 53] .",

This smoothing operation implies a loss of high frequencies or details in the original data. As a result, the inverse problem, backward diffusion, suffers from deficient information which is needed to uniquely reconstruct the original data. The introduction of noise due to measured data increases this difficulty even further. Consequently, a solution to the inverse problem -if it exists at all -is highly sensitive and heavily depends on the input data: Even the smallest flaw in the initial data can have a large impact on the evolution and may cause large deviations.

First, we enhance our model for convex backward diffusion to support not only a global and weighted setting but also a localised variant. We analyse this extended model in terms of well-posedness, stability, and convergence towards a unique minimiser. Furthermore, we formulate a simple explicit scheme for our newly proposed approach which shares all important properties with the time-continuous evolution. In this context, we provide a detailed discussion on the selection of suitable time step sizes. Additionally, we suggest two new applications: global contrast enhancement of digital colour images and local contrast enhancement of digital grey and colour images.",

We describe a general approach which allows to formulate weighted local and global evolutions. Section 3 includes proofs for model properties such as range and rank-order preservation as well as convergence analysis and the derivation of explicit steady-state solutions. Section 4 provides a simple explicit scheme which can be used to solve the occurring initial value problem. In Section 5, we explain how to enhance the global and local contrast of digital images using the proposed model. Furthermore, we discuss the relation to existing literature on contrast enhancement. In Section 6, we draw conclusions from our findings and give an outlook on future research.",

Often they are inspired by biology and describe long-range attractive and short-range repulsive behaviour between swarm members. The interplay of attractive and repulsive forces leads to flocking and allows to gain stability for the whole swarm. Inverting this behaviour -resulting in short-range attractive and long-range repulsive forces -leads to a highly unstable scenario in which the swarm splits up into small separating groups which might never reach a point where they stand still. One would expect that a restriction to repulsive forces only will increase this instability even further. However, we will present a model which copes well with exactly this situation. In our set-up every particle moves within the open interval (0, 1) and has an interaction radius of size 1. Keeping this in mind, let us briefly examine the two main assumptions of the evolution. First, there exist reflections for all particles at the left and right domain boundary. Secondly, the particles repel each other and -furthermore -get repelled by the reflections. However, due to the limited viewing range, only one of the two reflections of a certain particle is considered at any given time, namely the one which is closer to the reference particle (see Figure 1) . A special case occurs if the reference particle is located at position 0.5: the repulsive forces of both of its own reflections equal out.",

In Figure 2 we provide an illustration of three functions using a = 1 and n = 1, 2, 3. The penaliser is constructed following a three step procedure. First, the function \u03a8 (s 2 ) is defined as a continuously differentiable, decreasing, and strictly convex function for s \u2208 [0, 1] with \u03a8 (0) = 0 and \u03a6 \u2212 (1) = 0 (left-sided derivative). Next, \u03a8 is extended to [\u22121, 1] by symmetry and to R by periodicity \u03a8 (2 + s) 2 = \u03a8 (s 2 ). This results in a penaliser \u03a8 (s 2 ) which is continuously differentiable everywhere except at even integers, where it is still continuous. Note that \u03a8 (s 2 ) is increasing on [\u22121, 0] and [1, 2] . The flux \u03a6 is continuous and increasing in (0, 2) with jump discontinuities at 0 and 2 (see Figure  2 ). Furthermore, we have that \u03a6(s) = \u2212\u03a6(\u2212s) and \u03a6(2 + s) = \u03a6(s). Exploiting the properties of \u03a8 allows us to rewrite (4) without the redundant entries v N +1 , . . . , v 2N as",

Thus, we can achieve the time t = 2 \u00b7 10 \u22126 in Figure 5 in a single iteration. If one is only interested in an enhanced version of the original image with maximum global contrast there is an alternative, namely the derived steady state solution for linear flux functions (43) . The results are shown in the last column of Figure 5 . This figure also confirms that the solution of the explicit scheme (47) converges to the steadystate solution (43) for t \u2192 \u221e. From (43) it is clear that this steady state is equivalent to histogram equalisation. In summary, this means that the application of our global model to greyscale images offers an evolution equation histogram equalisation which allows to control the amount of contrast enhancement in an intuitive way through the time parameter t.",

Subsequently, our aim is the contrast enhancement of digital colour images without distorting the colour information. This means that we only want to adapt the luminance but not the chromaticity of a given image. For this purpose, we convert the given image data to YCbCr colour space [44, Section 3.5] since this representation provides a separate luminance channel. Next, we perform contrast enhancement on the luminance channel only. Just as for greyscale images we map all Y-values to the interval (0, 1) to fulfil our model requirements. After enhancing the contrast, we transform the colour information of the image back to RGB colour space. At this point it is important to mention that the colour gamut of the RGB colour space is a subset of the YCbCr colour gamut and during the conversion process of colour coordinates from YCbCr to RGB colour space the so-called colour gamut problem may occur: Colours from the YCbCr colour gamut may lie outside the RGB colour gamut and thus cannot be represented in RGB colour coordinates. Naik and Murthy [32] state that a simple clipping of the values to the bounds creates undesired shift of hue and may lead to colour artefacts. In order to avoid the colour gamut problem we adapt the ideas presented by Nikolova and Steidl [34] which are based on the intensity representation of the HSI colour space [20, Section 6.2.3]. Using the original and enhanced intensities, they define an affine colour mapping and transform the original RGB values. This preserves the hue and results in an enhanced RGB image. It is straightforward to show that their algorithms are valid for any intensityf of typef",

Thus, they are applicable to the luminance representation of the YCbCr colour space, too, i.e. c r = 0.299, c g = 0.587, c b = 0.114. Tian and Cohen make use of the same idea in [52] . As in [34] , our result image is a convex combination of the outcomes of a multiplicative and an additive algorithm (see [34, Algorithm 4 and 5] ) with coefficients \u03bb and 1 \u2212 \u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]. During our experiments we use a fixed value of \u03bb = 0.5 (for details on how to choose \u03bb we refer to [34] ). An overview of our strategy for contrast enhancement of digital colour value images is given in Figure  8 . Global Contrast Enhancement. Again, we apply the global model from Section 3.2 in order to achieve global contrast enhancement. As mentioned before, we consider the N different occurring Y-values of the YCbCr representation of the input image and denote them by v i (similar to Section 5.1 we neglect their positions in the image). Every entry of the weighting matrixw i,j contains the number of occurences of the value v j in the Y-channel of the image. It becomes clear that the application of our model -in this setting -basically comes down to histogram equalisation of the Y-channel. Figure 9 shows the resulting RGB images after global contrast enhancement. Similar to the greyscale scenario, we can either apply the explicit scheme (47) or -for \u03a6 = \u03a6 a,1 -estimate the steady state solution following (43) . For the first case the amount of contrast enhancement grows with the positive time parameter t. The second column of Figure 9 shows the results for \u03a6 = \u03a6 1,1 given time t. The corresponding steady state solutions are illustrated in the last column of Figure 9 .",

During our experiments we have fixed \u03a6(s) to the linear flux function \u03a6 1,1 (s) and \u03bb to 0.5. Valid bounds for the time step size \u03c4 are given in Theorems 9-11. From the theory in Section 3 and the subsequent experiments on greyscale and colour images it becomes clear that the amount of contrast enhancement grows with the diffusion time. Thus, it remains to discuss the influence of the parameters and \u03b3. We found out that the neighbourhood radius affects the diffusion time and controls the amount of perceived local contrast enhancement, i.e. it steers the localisation of the contrast enhancement process. Whereas small radii lead to high contrast in already small image areas, the size of image sections with high contrast increases with . For sufficiently large values of global histogram equalisation is approximated. Another interesting point is the choice of the weighting function \u03b3. Overall, choosing \u03b3 = \u03b3 1 leads to more homogeneous contrast enhancement resulting in smoother perception. For \u03b3 = \u03b3 2 the focus always lies on the neighbourhood centre which implies even more enhancement of local structures than in the preceding case. In summary, \u03b3 2 leads to more enhancement which, however, also creates undesired effects in smooth or noisy regions. Thus, we prefer \u03b3 1 over \u03b3 2 . Further experiments which visualise the effect of the parameters can be found in the supplementary material.",

As mentioned in Section 5.1, applying the global model -withW = 11 T -is identical to histogram equalisation (a common formulation can e.g. be found in [20] ). Furthermore, there exist other closely related histogram specification techniques -such as [45, 35, 36] -which can have the same steady state. If we compare our evolution with the histogram modification flow introduced by Sapiro and Caselles [45] , we see that their flow can also be translated into a combination of repulsion among grey-values and a barrier function. However, in [45] the repulsive force is constant, and the barrier function quadratic. Thus, they cannot be derived from the same kind of interaction between the v i and their reflected counterparts as in our paper.",

Of particular interest are the publications by Naik and Murthy [32] and Nikolova and Steidl [34] whose ideas are used in Section 5.2. Both of them suggest -based on an affine colour transform -strategies to overcome the colour gamut problem while avoiding colour artefacts in the resulting image. A recent approach which also makes use of these ideas is presented by Tian and Cohen [52] . Ojo et al. [37] make use of the HSV colour space to avoid the colour gamut problem when enhancing the contrast of colour images. A variational approach for contrast enhancement which tries to approximate the hue of the input image was recently published by Pierre et al. [41] .",

The underlying evolution makes use of ideas from the area of collective behaviour and -in terms of the latter -our model can be understood as a fully repulsive discrete first order swarm model. Not only it is surprising that our model allows backward diffusion to be formulated as a convex optimisation problem but also that it is sufficient to impose reflecting boundary conditions in the diffusion co-domain in order to guarantee stability. This strategy is contrary to existing approaches which either assume forward or zero diffusion at extrema or add classical fidelity terms to avoid instabilities. Furthermore, discretisation of our model does not require sophisticated numerics. We have proven that a straightforward explicit scheme is sufficient to preserve the stability of the time-continuous evolution. In our experiments, we show that our model can directly be applied to contrast enhancement of digital greyscale and colour images.",
