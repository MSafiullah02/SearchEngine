On the one hand, the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or RNA (dsRNA) genomes of numerous viruses need to be packaged into pre-formed capsids by virtue of a strong molecular motor, due to the high charge density and the rigid molecular conformation of the double-stranded nucleic acids on the nanoscale [1\u20133]. On the other hand, viruses with more flexible single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes tend to spontaneously self-assemble around the RNA filament, where the binding of the capsid coat proteins (CPs) can be guided both by structure- or sequence-specific as well as non-specific interactions [1, 2, 4\u20137].",

The presence of PSs alone does not, however, guarantee the packaging of RNA into virions. In addition to specific, localized structural features, RNA secondary and tertiary structure can be of importance for the interaction of the RNA with CPs prior to packaging [8\u201312]. What is more, the length of the RNA molecule itself is an important factor in the assembly, as it naturally carries a significant negative charge. The total charge of RNAs packaged into capsids of different ssRNA viruses is consistently greater than the positive charge of the basic amino acid (AA) residues lining the interiors of the capsids, making these viruses negatively overcharged [1, 2, 13]. This furthermore implies a direct relationship between the genome length and capsid charge, and in support of the importance of non-specific electrostatics driving RNA encapsidaton, the total positive charge on the capsid inner surface was observed to correlate with the length of the genomic RNA for a diverse group of ssRNA viruses [1, 14\u201316].",

These tail groups are extended, highly flexible N-terminal arms and unstructured regions of varying lengths, and are present in the majority of non-enveloped spherical ssRNA+  viruses, while the CPs of enveloped viruses possess only the unstructured regions, with no extended N-terminal arms [4, 18]. CP tail groups do not simply play crucial structural roles, but are highly involved in a wide range of biological functions: their disordered nature is essential in promoting correct particle assembly and RNA encapsidation [19], they help in the switching of the CP conformation during assembly [4], and when these tail groups are rich in positively charged residues, they can also control the size of the assembled particles, while their removal can prevent native capsid assembly [5]. Interestingly, not all charged tail groups necessarily serve the same function\u2014experimental evidence shows, for instance, that the tails of brome mosaic virus (BMV) and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) are not functionally analogous with regard to RNA packaging and seem to employ two distinct packaging mechanisms [5].",

            "text": "Thus, the CP structure of ssRNA viruses can be in general characterized by the presence of two structurally distinct regions: a globular and ordered C-terminal domain involved in the formation of two anti-parallel, four-stranded \u03b2-sheets with a jellyroll topology, and an extended, flexible N-terminal domain that is only partially ordered and thus not observable in the electron density [19]. These two structural regions lead to a variety of different interactions during virion assembly, including repulsive CP\u2013CP electrostatic interactions (which inhibit capsid assembly) competing with highly directional, specific CP\u2013CP pairing interactions, and both sequence-specific as well as non-specific electrostatic RNA-CP interactions, which can additionally help to overcome assembly barriers [17, 20]. Both experimental and computational observations show that weak interactions are in general required for productive capsid assembly [1], and that conformational flexibility together with the presence of disordered regions\u2014unusually common in RNA viral proteins\u2014can be related to the ability to interact with multiple and varying partners [21]. A computational study by Perlmutter and Hagan [22] has found that while PSs can confer arbitrarily high specificity of assembly over RNAs with uniform non-specific interactions, the degree of this specificity is overall insensitive to the underlying assembly driving forces, which can be, however, straightforwardly tuned by solution conditions (ionic strength, pH) and charge on the CP tail groups. In addition, the specificity conferred by the PSs can lead to kinetic traps in some regions of parameter space, while in others they indeed oversee a highly specific assembly. Their study found that specificity is maximal under conditions where non-specific interactions alone are slightly too weak to promote effective assembly.",

The fundamental importance of ARMs for RNA-CP interaction in several plant virus genera is well-established, and the positively charged N-tails can be thus envisioned to stabilize encapsidated RNAs within the virus particle [5, 23]. The existing works on N-terminal tails of virus CPs have used varying definitions of the N-tails and have either reported a direct correlation between the ssRNA genome length (and thus its total negative charge) and the net charge on the peptide arms [14, 15], or have concluded that there is no universal genome-to-tail charge ratio [16]. In this work, we provide two explicit and complementary definitions of the N-terminal tails\u2014based either on the secondary structure of the viral CPs or on the presence of intrinsically disordered regions in them\u2014and use them to classify the N-tails of a large number of ssRNA+  viruses. We compare how the predicted length and charge of the N-tails vary with other parameters, such as genome length and capsid size. In addition, we determine the solvent-accessible surface of the remaining (structured) parts of CPs and obtain the ionizable amino acid residues on them. With this, we are able to study the full pH dependence of the charge on both the N-tails and the CPs, a dependence which has been observed to have a significant impact on the self-assembly of viruses [22, 24\u201327].",

Taking this into account, we will always calculate the quantities such as N-tail charge as charge per tail, averaged over the different chains in a dataset entry. In the case of viruses belonging to Nodaviridae, the CP is cleaved in two during virion maturation, and their dataset entries often possess three copies of each of the resulting two proteins. However, during assembly of the CPs and genome into a provirion, where the N-terminal part of the CP plays an important role [4, 33], the CP is uncleaved [34].

The N-tail groups of CPs are structurally flexible regions, likely to be intrinsically disordered; such regions are often characterized by a high content of polar and charged residues and a low content of bulky hydrophobic residues [4, 19]. They may be ordered in the capsid via interactions with other viral components, but at the same time it is evident that they are flexible in the isolated protein. Taking this into account, we consider two complementary definitions and define the N-tail either\n(i)as the part of the CP extending from its N-terminus to the first occurrence of a given element of secondary structure; or(ii)as the first intrinsically disordered, contiguous region of the CP, starting again from its N-terminus.",

The single-code classification of protein secondary structure given by DSSP/STRIDE involves seven structural elements, such as 310 (G), \u03b1 (H), and \u03c0 (I) helices, hydrogen bonded turns (T), \u03b2-sheets (E), isolated \u03b2-bridges (B), and bends (S). Not all of these elements, however, necessarily correspond to the structurally-ordered part of a protein and could be present in the disordered region as well. Thus, in our definition of a protein N-tail, we terminate it at the first occurrence of any of the following structures: G, H, I, and E. We allow for the presence of T, B, and S structural elements in the tail region, as these represent very short stretches of bonding patterns and should thus not inhibit the flexibility of the N-tail. This definition turns out to be the most consistent in comparisons between individual chains of the same CP, as well as to provide a good match with the predictions of our second definition of an N-tail.",

What is more, common secondary structure assignment methods can underpredict certain structural elements, such as \u03c0-helices [37]. For this reason, we use a second, (ii), independent definition of N-tails and compare it to the first one. We base this definition on the predicted intrinsic disorder in the viral CPs, so that the flexible N-tails should, in general, correspond to a disordered N-terminal stretch of the CP. To predict the intrinsically disordered regions, we use the Metadisorder server (MD2) [38], one of the best predictors of protein disorder, which combines a number of different disorder predictors into a more accurate meta-prediction method. Using MD2, we thus obtain a prediction for the intrinsically disordered parts in the viral CPs based on their AA sequences. For simplicity, we consider only the first contiguous disordered region of the CP starting at its N-terminus to be the N-tail of the protein, which should be a valid assumption in most of the cases.",

In figure 2, we show the pH dependence of charge on the N-tails and CPs of two different viruses, CCMV and physalis mottle virus (PhMV), belonging to Bromoviridae and Tymoviridae families, respectively. In Bromoviridae, positive clusters of charge on the N-tails are known to play an important role in the assembly of functional virions, and the first 26 residues of CCMV carry a significant positive charge interacting strongly with the negatively charged RNA [13, 18]. Members of Tymoviridae are, on the other hand, predominantly stabilized by CP\u2013CP interactions [5].",

The CP of CCMV has an acidic isoelectric point (point of vanishing charge, where CPs can be crudely treated as electric dipoles [17, 39]), whereas the CP of PhMV has a basic one. The charge on the N-tails and its pH dependence are, on the other hand, quite different for the two viruses. The N-tails of CCMV have a large positive charge, mostly stemming from basic AAs and in particular from pronounced ARMs [5, 23], and the large positive charge persists far into the range of basic pH values. Charge on the N-tails of PhMV is comparatively much lower, and becomes negative early on in the pH range. This is true regardless of the definition of the N-tails we use, be it by virtue of secondary structure assignment or protein disorder prediction.",

Figure 3 shows the differences between the two methods in the predicted tail lengths and the average charge per tail, evaluated at three different pH values, for the entire dataset of analyzed viruses; individual plots of the differences in the predictions for two viruses, BMV and PhMV, are shown in figure S1 in the supplementary material. The example of BMV can also be seen in the sketch of figure 1, where the tail determined by the first definition is shown in the 3D structure of the CP, showing that it indeed ends at the bulk, structured part of the CP. In addition, the partial AA sequence of the protein already indicates that the major part of positive charge on the tail stems from arginine residues. The tail determined by the second definition is, on the other hand, shorter by 25 AA, but nonetheless captures the majority of the positively charged clusters on the tail (figure S1).",

Interestingly and notably, we observe that genome lengths of viruses which utilize positively charged N-tails appear to reach only a limited value (\u223c6 knt). Other viruses, which do not possess positively charged N-tails, tend to have longer genomes, all the way up to 10 knt. The only exception of a virus with positively charged tails and a comparable genome length is the recently discovered Orsay virus (PDB: 4NWV), which infects nematodes and bears semblance to viruses in Nodaviridae family, but has not yet been classified [41, 42]. The exceptions in the opposite sense are the phages belonging to Leviviridae family, which do not possess any tails and yet pack genomes of only 3\u20134 knt in length. Some of these phages, such as MS2, are known to utilize RNA packaging signals to direct their capsid assembly [43]. We note that viruses from Togaviridae family, absent in our dataset, are also known to possess N-tails containing clusters of positive charge [4, 14, 18]. While these viruses tend to pack longer genomes (\u223c10 knt), they also have significantly larger capsids with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}T=4 symmetry, unlike any virus in our dataset.",

This large difference is, interestingly, not related to the average size of the capsids into which these genomes are packaged (figure 7). The vast majority of the capsids have similar average size, even though their genome sizes vary significantly (as does their CP composition [5]). The observed difference in the genome sizes of the two broad classes of viruses is also not a consequence of the viruses without any charge on the tails actually having no tails at all\u2014the tails of the viruses in our dataset range anywhere from 0\u2013100 AA, and the lengths of non-charged tails can still approach 50 AA (figure S8 in the supplementary material). Similarly, the predicted lengths of the tails also do not correlate with the genome lengths (figure S9 in the supplementary material). Of course, the absence of net charge on the N-tails of viruses with longer genomes does not mean they cannot bind the genome. In these viruses, a more complex electrostatic mechanism could be at work, involving, for instance, polyampholyte-polyelectrolyte complexation [44\u201346] or multipolar interactions [39, 47].",

However, since these extended CP tail groups lack any definite structure and are thus intrinsically disordered, their definition cannot be entirely devoid of ambiguity. In an attempt to minimize this underlying vagueness, we investigated the length and the charge state of the N-tails of 80 distinct (and 116 in total) viruses in detail. We did this by introducing two concise but different definitions of a capsid protein N-tail, based either on the first occurrence of a given secondary structure element, or on the detection of an intrinsically disordered, contiguous part of the protein at the N-terminus end. In this choice we have attempted to generalize the previous work of Hu et al [15], based on a dataset of 27 viruses, where the N-tail was defined as the flexible sequence of AAs starting from the protein N-terminus and ending at the first \u03b1-helix (H) or \u03b2-sheet (E). Their work moreover established that the disordered (free) part of the N-tail, obtained from a comparison between the tail sequence and the missing part in the experimental data, entails on the average 76% of the full tail length.",

In the seminal work of Belyi and Muthukumar [14], focused on a subclass of 15 different WT and 5 mutant ssRNA viruses that bind their genome by using long and highly basic peptide arms, they found a linear scaling between the genome length and the net charge on the capsid peptide arms. This scaling appeared to be robust with very low uncertainty. The error of the charge on the peptide arms was estimated at just \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n}{}\\end{document}\u00b11 residue and mainly attributed to sequence variations between virus species and the uncertainty in distinguishing flexible peptide arms from the bulk of capsid protein. However, no detailed definition of the tail was provided, and it is unclear whether and how different definitions would modify the main results. Similar conclusion regarding the universality of the genome-to-tail charge ratio was also reached by Hu et al [15], who report a scattered charge inversion ratio with a median value 1.8 for a subset of 13 from the 27 viruses described above. Contrasting the claims of universality, a study by Ting et al [16], which used a thermodynamic framework to determine the optimal genome length in electrostatically-driven viral encapsidation, led to an opposite conclusion. Namely, they found no universal genome-to-capsid charge ratio, and that a fitted linear relationship between the genome and capsid charge is quite sensitive to the choice of viruses included in the dataset. Nevertheless, all the viruses from the [14] and [15] were found to be overcharged with respect to the packaged genome, a situation which the authors attribute to \u2018Donnan potential\u2019 and not specifically to the electrostatic attraction between the RNA and the capsomeres [6]. In addition, in all these works the RNA was treated as a linear polyelectrolyte, ignoring its secondary structures, which were very recently shown to affect the virus electrostatics profoundly and fundamentally [9, 10, 47].",

They do, however, show that the lengths of the WT genomes of these viruses do not seem to exceed  \u223c6 knt, unlike in other viruses with similar capsid size, although some caution should be exercised since this could easily be affected by the limited amount of viruses in our dataset. In addition, it is known that viruses with positively charged tails can also pack non-native RNAs and other polymers of different lengths [48, 49], as is the case with, e.g. CCMV. CCMV preferentially packages RNA1 of BMV instead of its own native RNA1 [50], and is found capable of packaging polyU RNAs, which do not form secondary structures and act essentially as structureless linear polymers [8]. The polyU RNAs are packaged more efficiently than WT RNAs of equal length, and while polyU RNAs up to 5 knt are completely packaged, the resuting virions exhibit smaller-than-WT capsids. Longer polyU RNAs up to 9 knt are also packaged, but into multiplet capsids. The conclusion is therefore that RNA secondary structure (or its absence) plays an essential role in determining the capsid structure during self-assembly of CCMV-like particles, as was later rationalized in detail from RNA polyelectrolyte models taking into account the secondary structure of non-linear RNAs [9, 10]. Inherently branched RNA secondary structure appears to allow viruses to maximize the amount of encapsidated genome, and makes the assembly more efficient and the virion more stable. Nevertheless, at present there is no good rationalization for why so many viruses show absolutely no correlation between the genome and the charge on the N-tails. One could in principle invoke PSs or, in more general terms, the sequence of the viral RNA that could somehow decouple the genomic charge and the structural capsid charge, leading to the features observed in figure 6.",

While the analysis of generic electrostatics for a linear RNA in a charged shell is straightforward, the details of the non-uniform charge distribution of the shell and indeed of the CP-tail effect, coupled to the secondary structure of the RNA genome, are more difficult to evaluate quantitatively but appear to underpredict the optimal genome length and thus the overall overcharging of the virion [47]. In addition, calculations based on linear polyelectrolytes, rather than base-paired nucleic acids, also underpredict the optimal length of the packaged genome, additionally demonstrating the importance of the nucleic acid structure for the assembly [23]. There is therefore a growing evidence that the sequence of the viral RNA plays an important role in packaging\u2014most probably through the coupling between the secondary structure of the RNA and its modifications when subjected to confinement in the virus shell with a complicated non-uniform charge distribution. The relative importance of RNA-RNA contacts compared to RNA-CP contacts and the detailed roles of specific and non-specific (electrostatic) interactions has yet to be determined conclusively.",

Lastly, we wish to mention a different possible source of discrepancies related to the choice of the virus dataset, and that is the structural data itself. Different database entries of CPs of the same virus can lack information both on sequence and structural level, to various degrees. In addition, experimental conditions used in determining the structure of the CP can vary\u2014including the pH of the surrounding solution, temperature, strain of the virus, and not the least the presence or absence of genomic material in the capsid itself. It is known, for example, that the amount of structural disorder found in capsid proteins varies strikingly not only between but also within viral families [19].",

For this reason, we included in our dataset also several different database entries of the same viral CP\u2014where available\u2014and investigated the resulting variations in the properties of their N-tails. Figure S10 in the supplementary material shows the examples of two viruses, human rhinovirus and PhMV, with four different entries each. In the case of the human rhinovirus, we include three different strains, which differ slightly already in the length of the full capsid protein. Sizes of PhMV capsid protein are on the other hand the same in all four cases, yet they, too, possess tails of slightly different lengths. As a consequence, we can observe in both examples some variation in the lengths of the determined tails and in the electrostatic properties of the tails and the CPs. The variation remains much in the same range as when we compared the variation between different definitions of N-tails, and this is the case also for other examples we examined. Some entries can again, however, yield quite different results: the pI of human rhinovirus 2, for instance, is acidic, while those of human rhinoviruses 1A and 16 are basic. Such differences are limited mostly to viruses coming from different strains. Importantly, the results for duplicate entries of viruses with positively charged tails that we have examined do not differ much (see tables S3 and S4 in the supplementary material).",

Predicted lengths of the N-tails usually agree within 20 AA, and consequent predictions of the average charge on the N-tails are within  \u00b12 e0. These differences are of the same order as the uncertainties stemming from the method used to determine the ionizable AAs and their charge [39].

This dependence shows how big of a game-changer the positively charged N-tails of some viruses can be, as they often contribute as much charge to the protein as the rest of the (structurally-ordered) CP itself, while pushing the pI of the capsid proteins to the basic range of pH. Our observations are in line with other studies showing that CP\u2013CP interactions get weaker with increased pH, while CP-RNA interactions remain strong by virtue of positively charged N-tails [26, 51, 52]. Here, we have shown that this is a robust consequence of the fact that the pH variation of the N-tail charge is much less pronounced than the corresponding variation for the structural part of the CPs. The understanding of the pH-dependence of charge in different viruses should have important consequences for the relative interplay of CP\u2013CP and RNA-CP interactions in them, which can be directly related to their assembly mechanisms as well as stability.",
