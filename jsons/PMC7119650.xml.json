Both diseases are spread by the oral uptake of feces from infected pigs, resulting in vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in nursery piglets (Pensaert, 1999, Saif and Wesley, 1999).",

            "text": "Conventional diagnostic assays use either antibodies or viral antigens to detect viral gastroenteritis. Several vaccines used for sows in Korea elicit immunoglobins (Igs) in maternal milk that help to protect offspring from infection. Therefore, serological examination cannot be used with these animals, since the vaccine does not distinguish between vaccinated animals and those infected with the wild-type virus. Several diagnostic assays are available for detecting viral antigens, including virus isolation, fluorescence assay, immune electron microscopy, in situ hybridization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Callebaut et al., 1982, Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988, Sueyoshi et al., 1995, Pensaert, 1999, Shibata et al., 2000, Kim and Chae, 2001, Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005). However, none of these techniques can be used for early detection of the viral antigen because they require clinical samples from the intestines of dead pigs and are cumbersome to use, resulting in rather long detection times. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which includes single and multiplex RT-PCR, has proven to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of PEDV and TGEV (Paton et al., 1997, Kim et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2001). This technique also has its limitations; it has lower sensitivity (\u223c10\u2013100 times) than real-time PCR, viral loads cannot be measured, and identifying the virus by agarose gel electrophoresis is time consuming (Keyaerts et al., 2006). RT-PCR also poses the potential risk of cross contamination during mass screening within the reverse transcription step. These drawbacks reduce the overall effectiveness of using RT-PCR to detect virus in new outbreaks and previous outbreak sites (Van Rijn et al., 2004, Ophuis et al., 2006).",

In this study, multiplex real-time RT-PCR was developed for differential detection and quantification of the viral loads of TGEV and PEDV in diarrhea from both experimentally and naturally infected piglets using two sets of primers and different colored probes in a single reaction tube.",

After precipitating with sequential ethanol solutions, the transcripts were dissolved in 200 \u03bcl of RNase-free H2O and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until used. The concentration of transcripts was determined using an ND-1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA) at 260 nm, from which the molecular number was calculated (Fronhoffs et al., 2002). Tenfold serial dilutions of the transcripts were prepared at concentrations of 9 \u00d7 107 to 9 \u00d7 101 copies of TGEV and 7 \u00d7 107 to 7 \u00d7 101 copies of PEDV per 2 \u03bcl volume and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was performed using these standard solutions to obtain standard curves. Intra-assay variability was evaluated with three independent samples of each virus tested in triplicate, demonstrating copy numbers of 9 \u00d7 107, 9 \u00d7 104, and 9 \u00d7 102 for TGEV and 7 \u00d7 107, 7 \u00d7 104, and 7 \u00d7 102 for PEDV. Inter-assay variability was also determined by testing the same three samples in triplicate over 3 days.",

Both viral loads in diarrhea were measured starting 1 or 2 days after inoculation with each virus, continuing until death. The viral loads of TGEV were first calculated on day 2, peaked on day 4, and then decreased until death. For PEDV, the viral load reached its highest level on day 1 and then decreased until death. In this study, the virus shedding time, viral loads, and period of viral persistence differed from those previously reported due to differences in titers, the size of the viral inoculum, and the ages of the experimental pigs. De Arriba et al. (2002) reported that PEDV peaked after 5 days as determined by fecal swabs and decreased for 8 days after inoculation.",

(2006), viral levels and piglet mortality show a low degree of correlation; some of our data were consistent with that report. Nevertheless, a correlation was noted: the larger the viral load detected by multiplex real-time RT-PCR, the higher the rate of piglet mortality. The results show that this assay can be used to determine viral loads in pig herds, which makes it an additional factor for evaluating the status of the affected farms. Furthermore, farms experiencing a disease outbreak can use information on viral loads to determine the most appropriate treatment, such as selection of vaccine type to protect their herds against future epidemics as described for quantitative RT-PCR using a PEDV internal control by Song et al. (2006). To optimize calculation of viral load by this assay, virus loads must be evaluated on farms where outbreaks are just beginning or ending to elucidate the potential transmission of both viral infections on pig farms.",
