The clinical characteristics of this disease were described [9, 10], but lacked the pathogenesis explanation and pharmacological therapies. The clinical syndrome, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, were recorded. Severe patients developed shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and even death [10]. According to the clinical manifestations, the confirmed COVID-19 patients can be divided into mild, common, severe, and critical type groups based on the China National Health Commission Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 6) [7]. The mild group refers to mild clinical symptoms, and no sign of pneumonia is found in chest computed tomography (CT) imaging. The common type refers to patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, and the sign of pneumonia in CT scanning. Severe COVID-19 patients present with any of the following: (1) shortness of breath, plus respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, (2) in resting state, oxygen saturation (SpO2) \u2264 93%, and 3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/Fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg. Critical COVID-19 patients are diagnosed by any of the following: (1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) shock, and (3) organ failures requiring intensive care unit admission and treatment.",

Specific steps are as follows. Throat swab samples were collected from patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2. After collection, samples were placed into a collection tube with 150 \u00b5L of virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extracted within 2 h using a respiratory sample RNA isolation kit. Then, a PCR reaction mixture containing 26 \u00b5L of PCR action buffer and 4 \u00b5L enzyme solution was added to 4 \u00b5L of the sample to perform RT-RCR. FAM (ORF-1ab region) and ROX (N gene) channels were selected to detect SARS-CoV-2, and the HEX channel was used for the internal standard. RT-PCR assay was performed under following conditions: incubation at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min and 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) of 40 or less for FAM or ROX channel was defined as a positive test result. Ct-values more than 40 for FAM and ROX channels and Ct-value of 40 or less for HEX channel were defined as a negative test. Also, Ct-values for FAM, ROX, and HEX more than 40 were defined as an invalid test result.",
