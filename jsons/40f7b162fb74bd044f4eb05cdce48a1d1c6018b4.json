We noted significant heterogeneity in incidence estimates for the incidence of viral infections (Cochran's \u03c7 2 = 269.9, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 91.8%). The combined incidence of viral infections was 22.4% (95% CI = 19.0-25.7). Incidences of viral coinfections with other pathogens ranged from 3 to 28%. A high level of heterogeneity was identified as well during the estimates for incidences of coinfections (\u03c7 2 = 200.9, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 91.5%). The combined incidence of viral coinfections with other pathogens was 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0). Our heterogeneity analyses suggested that a lower respiratory tract sample was associated with higher overall viral incidence. Moreover, the influenza virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus were the 3 most frequently detected viral pathogens in adult patients with CAP according to our study. Conclusions: Respiratory viruses are probably crucial pathogens of adult patients with CAP, with the influenza virus being the most frequent viral pathogen identified. More than half of the viral infections are characterized as mixed infections with other pathogens.",

Yet, up to now, there has been a lack of synthetic data that clearly demonstrates the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP. Objectives: We intended to demonstrate the incidence of respiratory viral infections detected by PCR and real-time PCR in adult patients with CAP. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies providing the incidence of respiratory viral infections in adult patients with CAP. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by a univariant metaregression analysis and calculated the combined incidence of viral infections, viral infections mixed with other pathogens and individual respiratory virus species. Results: We eventually identified 23 eligible reports with a total number of 6,404 patients. Incidences ranged from 8.6 to 56.2%",

In order to reduce the heterogeneity across studies and perform further analysis, a subgroup analysis was required. We further investigated potential sources of heterogeneity by metaregression analysis. Factors examined individually in univariable models were the sample type used for viral detection (by comparing a lower respiratory tract specimen with an upper respiratory tract specimen), time span of patient enrollment, geographical region, number of viral species detected and number of viral detection methods. We did all analyses in Stata (version 12.1, StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex., USA) with the commands 'metan' (for random-effects meta-analysis), 'metareg' (for metaregression) and 'metainf' (for sensitivity analysis).",

[22] 2010 New Caledonia 0.21 (0.14 -0.28) 4.12 Shibli et al. [21] 2010 Considering that the subgroup analysis cannot explain all sources of heterogeneity among the incidence of respiratory viruses in patients with CAP, we further carried out a univariate metaregression analysis ( table 3 ) and found that the viral incidence was higher in studies in which lower respiratory tract specimens were collected for viral detection (p = 0.048) than in those in which only upper respiratory tract specimens were collected for viral detection. Additionally, we did a sensitivity analysis and found that the study by Cilloniz et al. [20] might have contributed to the heterogeneity. However, the recombined incidence of respiratory viruses after omission of that study was 23.0% (95% CI = 19.7-26.3, I 2 = 90.5%), which was similar to the combined incidence before omission. figure 3 , the incidence estimates of coinfections ranged from 3 to 28%; heterogeneity was considerable (\u03c7 2 = 200.9, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 91.5%). The combined overall incidence of coinfections of respiratory viruses with other pathogens (mainly bacteria) was 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0, I 2 = 91.5%). Due to the high level of heterogeneity, the subgroup analysis was performed according to the patient types, economic level of the countries and regions where the studies were performed, as mentioned above. The combined incidence of coinfections was 12.9% (95% CI = 9.7-16.1, I 2 = 91.3%) in inpatients with CAP [7, 14-19, 21, 22, 24, 26-28] and 13.7% (95% CI = 7.1-20.3, I 2 = 90.6%) in mixed patients with CAP [29] [30] [31] [32] . Since only 1 study provided the inci-dence of coinfections in outpatients with CAP [12] , a combined estimate was not performed. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the time span of the studies, the combined incidence of respiratory viruses in the studies covering 1 year and >1 year was 12.5% (95% CI = 9.2-15.7, I 2 = 91.3%) and 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0, I 2 = 94.1%), respectively. Additionally, the combined incidence of coinfections was 12.3% (95% CI = 9.3-15.3, I 2 = 91.1%) and 12.4% (95% CI = 9.7-15.0, I 2 = 93.6%) in developed countries and developing countries, respectively. Moreover, the combined incidence of coinfections was similar between Europe [7, 14, 17, 18, 24, [28] [29] [30] , Southeast Asia [12, 15, 19, 32] and Australia [22, 26, 27] (12.9, 11.4 and 10.6%, respectively) as shown in table 4 .

Moreover, the combined incidence of viral infections mixed with other pathogens (mainly bacteria) is 12% in our study, constituting more than half of the total viral infections in adult patients with CAP. Evidence from several studies illustrated that viral infections made hosts susceptible to secondary bacterial infections because mucosal barriers in the respiratory tracts were impaired during previous viral infections [33, 34] , which led to the bacterial invasions becoming more facile. There is evidence as well, although sparse, suggesting that mixed viral-bacterial infections would generate a severer inflammatory status and clinical presentation than individual bacterial or viral infections [24, 26, 35] . Severe fatal pneumonia can be caused by concomitant infection with the influenza virus and Staphylococcus aureus in both children and adults [36] [37] [38] . Moreover, in 1 pneumonia study focused on adults, rhinovirus-pneumococcal coinfections correlated with severe pneumonia and raised mortality [24, 26, 35] . Therefore, our results would be helpful for clinicians to better recognize the burden of viral infections and mixed viral-bacterial infections on adult patients presenting with CAP. The influenza virus is the most frequent viral pathogen detected in adult patients with CAP as our study demonstrates, which is inconsistent with the fact that the respiratory syncytial virus is the leading viral pathogen in pediatric patients with CAP [39] [40] [41] [42] . Influenza vaccination has been previously proven to be efficient in preventing influenza viral infections especially during a pandemic influenza period [43] . Furthermore, several studies which enrolled patients with a chronic lung disease indicated that an influenza vaccination significantly reduced the incidence of pneumonia or acute exacerbations in those patients [44] . Therefore, a regular and routine influenza vaccination of patients with chronic lung disease would be needed to lower the burden of pneumonia caused by the influenza virus. Moreover, newly developed anti-influenza virus drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir), which have established roles in the early treatment of influenza infections through reducing the median time to the resolution of the symptoms and the risk of pneumonia [45] , provided an efficient weapon for clinicians to manage patients with viral pneumonia caused by the influenza virus.",

However, conventional virological diagnostic techniques such as serology, immunofluorescence and culture have been underestimating the contribution of viruses to the pathogenesis of CAP [46, 47] , especially in adult patients, due to their low sensitivity and narrow application. Owing to the development of more rapid and sensitive detection methods (PCR and real-time PCR), the viral diagnosis is largely improved, particularly through the combined application of these methods with conventional detection techniques [7] . Lots of previous studies evaluating the role of respiratory viruses in adult patients with CAP have been reported; nevertheless, there are discrepancies in the detection methods used for viral diagnosis across those studies. Therefore, we only included studies applying sensitive detection techniques (PCR and real-time PCR) for viral diagnosis in our further meta-analysis to reduce possible heterogeneity along with obtaining quantitative syntheses of original data.",

Our following heterogeneity analyses generated 1 potentially important finding, namely that lower respiratory tract specimens were associated with higher overall viral incidence. This may be because the molecular detection of the virus in lower respiratory tract specimens was more sensitive than the one in upper respiratory tract specimens. The potential implication of this result is that the presence of viral nucleic acids, detected by PCR of lower respiratory tract samples, implies stronger evidence of the infection by virus. However, no relation was identified between the incidence of coinfection and the lower respiratory tract specimens, which might be explainable. As we could speculate, discrepancies of both bacterial diagnostic and viral detection would lead to a significant heterogeneity of the incidence of coinfection. Caution is necessary when combined incidence estimates are used due to the significant heterogeneity, and further surveys are required for the standardization of the specimen collection, specimen quality, PCR primers and PCR reaction conditions during respiratory viral etiology diagnosis.",
