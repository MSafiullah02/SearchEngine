All patients had fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness and chest computed tomography (CT) images indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia. Most pregnant women had cesarean delivery (91.7%) and two neonates had low birthweight (< 2,500 g). Biological samples collected immediately after birth from upper respiratory tract (throat or nasopharyngeal) of neonates and placental tissues showed negative results for the presence SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test. In addition, no breast milk samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In three studies (10,12,13) there was a clear recommendation for mother\u2019s to not breastfeed their children despite the lack of evidence on the potential viral transmission via breast milk.",

            "text": "As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience fear and uncertainties regarding the care of their child. Making decisions without a robust evidence base may influence mother-child interactions and lead to poor outcomes. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus among health agencies regarding breastfeeding for women with COVID-19. In February 2020, the National Health Commission of China recommended that neonates of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be isolated in a designated unit for at least 14 days and should not be breastfeed due to the high risk of infection (16). Although this expert working group has suggested breastfeeding only in cases of negative tests for SARS-CoV-2, this warning may contribute to reducing breastfeeding by women with no exposure to the virus which may lead to infant poor health outcomes. On the other hand, interim guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (17) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (18) advises that breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers, and all possible prevention measures to avoid spreading the virus to the infant must be taken including wearing a mask and washing hands and breasts with soap and water before breastfeeding. If the woman opts to express breast milk, all recommendations for cleaning the breast pumps and utensils after each use must be rigorously followed. Consideration should be given to the possibility of someone healthy providing breast milk to the infant using a cup or spoon. This person must receive training from a qualified professional before starting procedures. If there is no production of breast milk by the mother, a human milk bank should be contacted. There are no restrictions on the use of milk from a human breast milk bank (19,20). The possibility of drug excretion into breast milk with potential adverse effects in breastfeed neonates should also be analyzed (21). To date, there is no evidence on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk of pregnant women with COVID-19. Data provided on current literature are still limited and breastfeeding of women with COVID-19 remains a controversial issue. Further studies with large samples are needed to confirm these results particularly given the importance of breastfeeding in preventing other childhood illnesses.",
