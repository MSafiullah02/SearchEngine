Differences in preparation and processing methods for bone can impact properties and clinical performance. Biological testing of processed bone and the outcome measures to validate biological activity (i.e., the so-called osteoinductive index, OI, described herein) are not uniform among tissue banks, and as a result DBM products have variable composition and properties. This variability has obvious significance for clinicians and patients, but also issues for understanding performance in research studies. In addition, DBM products consist of bone-derived particle sizes and particle size ranges, even protein fibers. DBM sterilization protocols are also variable. Finally, the composition of various carriers combined with the DBM, and DBM combined with various bioactive substances will influence clinical and research outcomes. Best practices and consensus for use are difficult to ascertain from the literature. The diverse types of DBM products as well as commercial claims regarding the performance of those products leads to many questions about clinical effectiveness, future opportunities and understanding how it is best used. Given DBM's substantial history that weaves biology together and clinical applications, an initial review of its history, contemporary and factual clinical basis for DBM properties and clinical utility in bone repair is useful to understand current usage trends and future opportunities. Importantly, in this context, DBM was the original source for discovery of several key growth factors that were subsequently cloned and recombinantly expressed to become FDA-approved clinical therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-7 in bone repair (rhBMP-7 is no longer FDA-approved but has a highly restrictive human device exemption label).",

            "text": "Early publications by Harakas [6] and Glowacki and Mulliken [7] provide key historical information for first identifying and recognizing important pioneering work on DBM. Context for DBM use was prompted by clinical recognition of the value of bone grafting that alone has substantial history. A 1632 report regarding a Russian soldier successfully treated with dog bone graft (the first reported bone xenograft) elicited vociferous condemnation from the Christian church [8]. The treating surgeon, Meek'ren, fearing excommunication, removed the xenograft. Autografting was also reported by Macewen in 1881 [9] who speculated that transplanted osteoblasts carried in the autograft were responsible for success. Senn in 1889 used decalcified bone to treat osseous defects [10]. He soaked tibiae from oxen in hydrochloric acid (HCl), using logic that HCl had antiseptic effects on the xenograft and would benefit patients with osteomyelitis. Deaver [11], Curtis [12] and Mackie [13] validated Senn's work. During World War I (1914\u20131917), combat-incurred injuries requiring bone grafting prompted resurgence in autografting. Notable clinician-scientists Phemister [14] and Groves [15] systematically studied autografting using pre-clinical models. Phemister underscored the need for \u2018mechanical stress\u2019 for successful structural bone grafting. While the concept of load may not have been specifically stated, the implications were that limb function following grafting is an important, positive bone-promoting stimulus. Phemister then introduced the \u2018creeping substitution\u2019 concept where host bone grows into bulk allograft. Barth (1893) [16] and Axhausen [17] previously described a process where host bone grows into other grafted bone. Contemporary nomenclature for \u2018creeping substitution\u2019 is \u2018osteoconduction\u2019, the term coined by Urist (reviewed in [18]). Groves emphasized the importance of \u2018secure fixation\u2019 of the graft to the recipient bed as well as noting viable bone produced better outcome than non-viable bone [15].",

Furthermore, time on the operating room table, infection risk and increased patient care costs were concerns that persist today as contemporary challenges.

The alcohol extracts injected into skeletal muscle produced osteogenesis. These studies were phenomenological, and it was not until 1945 and 1947 that a biological explanation was offered by Lacroix [25], [26] who thought that bone contained \u2018substances\u2019 that enabled osteogenesis. His 1947 paper in Nature stated that \u2018osteogenin\u2019, speculated to be in bone, initiated its growth [26]. Ray and Holloway [27] and then Urist in his landmark paper in Science\n[28] determined ectopic osteogenesis occurred when demineralized bone was implanted into a non-bony site. This elegantly detailed scientific explanation of ectopic osteogenesis coined the term \u2018autoinduction\u2019. Urist posited that the substratum (the non-mineralized matrix of bone) was key, providing morphogenetic signals that prompted osteogenesis. It is highly noteworthy that in 1971, Urist and Strates introduced \u2018bone morphogenetic protein\u2019 (BMP) and \u2018osteoinduction\u2019 to the scientific and clinical communities [29]. Urist systematically and lucidly presented a visionary process\u2014still highly relevant today\u2014of bone morphogenesis promoted by the demineralized component of bone: the organic substratum (as Urist called it) [30].",

This demineralized component was proven to contain the biological drivers essential for osteogenesis. This history provides a conceptual foundation to develop several issues germane to the biological activity of DBM and its clinical utility, including procurement, donor profile (e.g., gender, age), processing, production issues, sterilization, and its combinations with carrier biomaterials.",

The procurement process is highly regulated by the FDA and specific requirements are found in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 21) Part 1270. Compliance with these tissue processing guidelines requires the cooperation of independent organizations, including hospital-based medical staff, recovery and screening organizations, tissue processing facilities and sales and distribution organizations. The starting point is an assessment of the suitability of a donor conducted by a recovery or screening organization based on general criteria followed by an initial medical screening. The family of the deceased donor is consulted to obtain an informed consent for tissue donation.

FDA mandates that a detailed medical and social history is obtained to uncover social and behavioral risk factors (see Supplementary Table 1). The information is obtained through interviews with family and other close contacts of the donors. In some instances identification of a behavioral risk factor disqualifies a donor and in other cases it triggers further investigation. The next assessment is a physical examination that may reveal evidence of risk factors or signs of pathologies not otherwise detected through serological testing and could lead to donor exclusion (Supplementary Table 2). Finally, a series of clinical tests are completed to rule out Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and treponema pallidum (syphilis).

In general, the DBM preparation protocol includes donor bone debridement of adherent soft tissues and removal of blood and lipids. At this point, often an antibiotic soak is used to initiate the sterilization process. Subsequently, cleansed donor bone is morsellized to defined particles or fibers and subjected to acid demineralization followed by one or more rounds of freeze-drying. The mineral phase is extracted from the particulate whole donor bone with 0.5\u20130.6 N HCl, leaving the organic matrix intact. Upon freeze-drying, the resulting demineralized bone powder (synonymous with DBM) can be formulated into putties, pastes and more recently, flexible, pre-formed strips for implant use.

Consequently, some discussion regarding the optimal size and size range of particle for DBM preparations suggests that particles less than 250 \u03bcm are not as osteoinductive as larger-sized (420\u2013840 \u03bcm) particles [5], [41], [42]. Generally, preclinical data are inconsistent regarding DBM compositions as particles and their size ranges, as well as for fibers, and DBM formulations in sheets and gels. Inconsistency is due to different animal models and outcome measures, many of which are highly subjective and are unique to one laboratory and not universally accepted. Moreover, human data on DBM are weak due in part to the emphasis on DBM as a bone graft extender rather than as a stand-alone therapy. Consequently, the efficacy for different formulations for DBM has not been clearly elucidated. Formulation design features are largely empirically ascertained in arbitrary test beds.",

Moreover, individual \u2018DBM lots\u2019 processed by the same tissue bank may possess different osteoinductive capacities, and these capacities may vary among different donors. While biological activity is measured by osteoinduction and is reported as the osteoinductive index, OI, no DBM \u201cpotency\u201d or \u201ccompositional\u201d regulatory standards are enacted across DBM products to understand or control these differences.

Room temperature storage is the most inexpensive mode and is often considered a product feature promoted in marketing biomaterials. Storage conditions and product expiration dates must be explicitly stated in the DBM product insert. Most producers of DBM test transient product exposures to elevated temperatures to simulate potential temperature extremes that can occur during shipping. If temperature limits are identified, then manufacturers place temperature limit indicators on product packaging and clinicians are directed to not use the product if the indicator has been triggered. Unfortunately, there is a limited understanding of how storage conditions impact DBM shelf-life and OI. Consequently, different DBM producers may indicate on their respective packet inserts either storage at room temperature or freezing the DBM product. A recent report sheds light on a potential mechanistic approach to storage and stability issues for DBM [73]. The authors used an in vitro alkaline phosphatase assay and an ectopic bone formation assay in nude mice to determine the OI of either hydrous or anhydrous DBM preparations after prolonged exposure to temperatures as high as 65 \u00b0C. Anhydrous DBM was substantially more resistant to temperature related effects on OI than hydrous versions of DBM.",

However, there is limited data to date to support exclusionary criterion based upon either one. A potential age-related factor may include metabolic competence and relevancy to the balance between bone resorption and deposition. Investigations of correlative properties in vitro suggest age-related effects. For example, Groessner-Schreiber et al. reported osteoclast recruitment assessed in a chick chorioallentoic membrane assay was decreased in human DBM prepared from donors of increasing age [2]. However, their report used DBM from a cohort of only eight donors ranging in age from 18 to 72. Consequently, the study may have been insufficiently powered. Aaboe and colleagues found that ectopic bone formation by DBM from differently aged rats seemed to indicate a modest age-related increase in osteoinductivity from younger vs. older rat donors [3]. Moreover, an evaluation of human DBM preparations from age and sex stratified donors indicated a correlation between donor age and the amount extractable BMP-2 suggesting with an increase in age there was a decrease in BMP content (reviewed in [83]). A similar profile was observed for BMP-4 [84]. In contrast to these reports, no significant correlation was suggested between donor age and BMP-2, -4 and \u20107 [83]. Given that BMP-2 levels are in the nanogram per gram level in cortical bone, it is unclear that age related effects of either BMP-2 or TGF- are clinically meaningful [83].",

While loading is critical to stimulate new bone, DBM implantation is performed in the absence of controlled mechanical loading. After approximately 28 days, the rodent is euthanized and the explanted muscle mass is radiographed and tissues are processed for histological assessment. The radiograph is examined for radiopacity. The histological tissue assessment includes a subjective grading of bone formation among a number of random histological sections at a certain magnification using a stain of choice for the laboratory (e.g., Goldner trichrome). An arbitrary \u2018value\u2019 (i.e., some numerical \u2018grade\u2019) is given by the examiner to the histology slide based on the bone observed without any clear standard or endpoint for bone architecture defined for the field.

Similarly, demineralized bone products in foot surgery have been infrequently reported [109], [110]. Weinraub and Cheung used allogeneic bone either with or without demineralized bone in several procedures including arthrodesis, segmental lengthening, and treatment of nonunion. Michelson and Curl evaluated demineralized and autogenous bone for subtalar fusions and triple arthrodesis in 55 patients over a 5 year period [111]. They concluded that demineralized bone grafts aid arthrodesis at least as well as iliac crest bone graft and without the increased blood loss, cost, and postoperative pain associated with iliac crest bone harvest.",

However, demineralized bone has garnered attention in the repair of cysts [112], fractures, segmental bone defects, and non-unions. Tiedman and his group used demineralized bone, alone, and as a composite graft with autogenous bone marrow in orthopaedic applications [113]. They concluded that DBM and marrow composite grafting is a suitable alternative to autogenous iliac crest bone graft for clinical situations such as bone defects in children, comminuted fractures with associated bone loss, non-united fractures, or for augmentation of arthodesis [113]. In one of the few prospective studies using demineralized bone products in orthopaedics, Geesink et al. [114] compared Osteogenic Protein-1 (OP-1: Stryker Biomedical, Inc.; also known as rhBMP-7) to Grafton Gel in fibular defects. At early time points, OP-1 had superior union, however, at 12 months, there was no difference in bone mineral density scores between OP-1 and DBM Grafton Gel. Although controversial, controlled studies and anecdotal reports suggest that bone graft substitutes, including demineralized bone matrix, may result in improved treatment outcomes for patients with fractures of the distal radius [115].",

First, using demineralized bone in conjunction with autogenous bone demonstrates a synergistic osteogenic response. Second, demineralized bone products in bone defects provide qualitative and quantitative bone healing results depending on the volumetric characteristics of the defects. Osseous defects with only two walls (e.g., segmental or continuity defects) would be expected to have less predictable osteogenesis than defects with only one wall. Third, demineralized bone products are not advised for augmenting facial and cranial contour deficits due to the tendency for resorption. Fourth, considerable variability in tissue banking processing of demineralized products, as well as lot-to-lot variability in composition and OI are confusing and concerning still to DBM use. Though DBM can be successful if used alongside allograft bone, its use alone in applications undergoing high compressive loads is contraindicated, leading to greater graft collapse in the inherent absence of structural rigidity.",

Among the clinically most successful filler is DBM. DBM is osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and relatively easy to use clinically, especially in carrier formulations of diverse offerings. Moreover, DBM can extend the volume of an autograft. Maturation of DBM as a bone biology tool to understand BMP growth factor biology and pioneer bone regenerative recombinant therapeutics has led to tissue banking protocols that have standardized donor procurement, processing and sterilization. DBM initially was a non-FDA regulated tissue-derived product. However, as its clinical appeal expanded, innovative DBM formulations with carriers were designed and developed to increase clinical utility. Consequently, with this manipulation for clinical use, the FDA now regulates DBM as a 510(k) medical device. Therefore, DBM products must satisfy regulatory guidelines to ensure biocompatibility, manufacturing validation, shelf life and osteoinductive potential. It is the latter biological property that garners the most interest from clinicians in bone applications: DBM's intrinsic osteoinductive mechanism by releasing endogenous BMPs and growth factors by diffusion and matrix biodegradation.",

DBM OI modulation, standardization, and product validation seem like near-term needs. However, despite the modest product growth rates anticipated for DBM in the surgical marketplace, DBM is currently a highly valued therapeutic device for surgeons that should continue to remain important, especially in light of emerging markets and current health care systems that cannot bare substantial costs associated with recombinant growth factor delivery (see contributions in this theme issue on protein therapeutics for bone).
