A syndromic or disease surveillance system should therefore serve all levels, from the local healthcare service to the national and global level [2], [3].",

Lober et al. [5] provide a good description of the information sources that can be monitored to detect an outbreak as early as possible. Where affected people present may depend on the type of disease and on the organisation of the healthcare service. In Norway, which has a system of personal general practitioners (GPs) with gatekeeper functions to secondary and tertiary levels of care, patients will typically consult their GP or the casualty clinic in the first instance. Patients are only likely to present at a hospital emergency unit if they are acutely ill (for example, if they have been injured in an accident, or referred to the casualty clinic by the GP). A telephone survey in the USA, in New York, showed that 29.1% of persons with influenza-like illness (ILI) visited a physician, 21.4% called a physician for advice, 8.8% visited the emergency department, and 3.8% called a nurse or health hotline [6]. The EHR systems used by GPs are therefore likely to be very good sources for detecting disease outbreaks in a healthcare context where most people normally consult their GP in the first instance if they get ill. However, using patient data stored in the EHR system is difficult because of the privacy issues involved in exporting data from the EHR systems [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].",

If a new disease appears, as in the case of SARS, or as result of a deliberate spread, disease surveillance may become more difficult. First, we do not have codes for specifying confirmed, probable or possible cases of the new disease. This may easily be solved if it is sufficient merely to update the coding system. How fast such an update can be performed depends on a number of factors: How fast can the coding system be updated, how fast can the new version be disseminated, how fast can the updated code-set be employed, etc. Updating a disease classification is normally done very infrequently and the reliability of such classifications is therefore problematic when the goal is to count occurrences of a new disease. The creation of an additional coding system for contagious diseases, which enables quick updating, may provide a solution to this problem. However, this is also problematic, because duplication of coding systems adds to the quantity of information, which must be entered into the EHR systems. Basing surveillance of new diseases on existing classification categories is therefore problematic and adds to the complexity of the problem. However, without such disease codes we cannot automatically count the number of cases and get a picture of the geographical diffusion of the disease.",

Conditions with similar symptom patterns may be interpreted as possible or probable cases, thereby polluting the diffusion pattern. In the case of SARS, a visit or contact with a person who had visited a geographic area where there were reported cases was a main indicator of probable or possible cases. Such conditions are not known beforehand [13]. In the case of SARS, the definition of possible and probable cases evolved over the weeks following the outbreak from initially being very vague to becoming a very specific set of symptoms. It may therefore be necessary to distribute new and updated syndrome definitions if local classification of cases based on the syndrome definition is required. This dynamic behaviour of a disease or syndrome definition makes it hard to build software that automatically identifies and distinguishes between possible, probable and confirmed cases.",

[14] are based on the centralised storage and analysis of data. These systems have been classified as using first- or second-generation architectures for data integration [9]. The Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance system (RODS) from the University of Pittsburgh [12] also uses a centralised approach. The emergency departments covered by the system send HL7 messages containing ICD-9 codes in real time to a centralised inference system where outbreaks are detected. When a disease outbreak is detected by RODS, the appropriate authorities are informed about the situation. The outbreak detection process is run periodically on the data available to the system. The Bio-Surveillance, Analysis, Feedback, Evaluation and Response (B-SAFER) system [2], [15] is based on a federated approach involving the open source OpenEMed infrastructure. OpenEMed [16] (formerly known as TeleMed [17]) is based on the Clinical Observation Access Service (COAS) [18] and Patient Identification Data Service (PIDS) [19] CORBAMed specification of the Object Management Group. B-SAFER and OpenEMed take a more interoperable approach that demonstrates the value of the federated approach to syndromic surveillance, which makes it possible to view and manage information at several levels ranging from local to regional, national and global levels [2].",

The consultation date with the GP is therefore test_received_date minus 1 day, and consultation time equals test_received_time.2.We assume that all GPs have the same behaviour regarding entering data into the electronic patient record (EHR) system.3.They all create a consultation entry in the EHR system using the date and time values specified above.4.They all do a test from the posterior nasopharynx using darcon or calcium alginate swabs, which they send to the hospital laboratory and order a \u201cB. pertussis PCR\u201d (Bordertella pertussis) laboratory test (ICPC2 process code-33 Microbiological/Immunological Test) (code 6232 and 6192 in the lab system).5.If the lab report is negative, the GP does nothing. If the lab test is positive, the doctor creates a telephone consultation with the patient using \u201cR71 Whooping cough\u201d as the diagnosis, and prescribes erythromycin. Five days later the patient is assumed not to be contagious to others. (Pertussis is most contagious during the first week. Three weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient is seldom contagious.)6.The \u201cX days since onset\u201d value for the whooping cough patients will probably vary widely. We assume the distribution of X is Gaussian. We assume that most people will not see their GP before the second stage of the disease has started (7\u201314 days after onset of symptoms), when the severe cough with whooping and vomiting begins. This value may also vary with the age and gender of the patient. We assume it is likely that babies under the age of one (below 1 year in the test dataset) probably see their doctor earlier than older children do. We also assume male patients wait longer to see their GP than female patients do. Knowledge about an outbreak probably also affects how early a patient sees their GP. We assume that children <2 years see their GP 2\u20135 days after onset of symptoms, children \u22652, <8 years see their GP 3\u20137 days after onset, and that children \u22658, <18 years see their GP 5\u201310 days after onset.

Use of the cache reduces the processing time to an average of 1.53 s (over 10 execution runs with S.D. 0.57) when interrogating the server in Troms\u00f8, Norway from Brisbane, Australia. By relaxing the requirement for freshness of data, and scheduling periodic epidemiology missions to slow hosts, it seems to be possible to achieve an acceptable response time from the epidemiology service even if servers with 1997 technology (server 6) are used.

Because most patients in Norway see a GP as their first point of contact with the healthcare system, we should provide the general practitioners with the necessary tools to discover local disease outbreaks. A syndromic surveillance system should therefore include data from the EHR system used by doctors to increase the coverage of the system. In Norway this implies using EHR data from GPs for surveillance purpose. This is feasible, because Norway has close to 100% coverage of EHR systems among GPs.

In addition to the mandatory reporting undertaken by all GPs, approximately 200 GP clinics report weekly, during the winter, about the occurrence of a selection of diseases (including ILI). Achieving good coverage and high accuracy has been a problem in Norway as in other countries [39], [68], [69], [70], [71] and is also limited by the question of cost. Previous attempts to report the number of cases of selected diseases on pre-printed postcards proved too expensive to be sustainable. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health produces a weekly report (the MSIS report) containing the number of occurrences at a national and county level. The reporting frequency has been too slow and the geographic level too coarse-grained to be of any practical use in triggering general practitioners\u2019 awareness of disease outbreaks.

We believe such use of the system will have a positive effect on data quality in primary care.

The time advantage may sometimes be as much as a day, depending on geography and sample delivery routines. If the system counts the occurrences of prodromes or even just the rate of lab test requests, it can raise the awareness of local GPs about an outbreak long before the laboratory sees enough cases to issue an alarm. The Snow Agent system also has the advantage that it can count cases that are diagnosed using epidemiological techniques, for instance in situations where a whole family is affected.
