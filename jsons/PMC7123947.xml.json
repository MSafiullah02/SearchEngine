Secretion retention in airways may cause obstruction of broncopulmonary units and atelectasis, and this is even more pronounced in smokers and in patients with chronic lung disease. The diagnosis of sputum retention can be clinical and it is characterized by respiratory distress with rapid, shallow, and bubbly breaths. There was a strong association between sputum retention and postoperative pneumonia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking history, and poor analgesia [10]. There is a great importance for physiotherapy in this situation. At least two daily visits should be performed; some patients need more. Another noteworthy point is the hydration of patients for secretion mobilization. Oxygen therapy via a facemask inevitably dries secretions when non-humidified oxygen is used. This causes mucociliary dysfunction and a decreased ability to clear secretions, so humidified oxygen should be used. Sometimes mucolytic agents can be helpful. Chest physiotherapy is a therapeutic modality that should be kept in mind. Postural drainage, percussion, and vibration are applied to the affected lung opening and promote coughing during which physicians should provide adequate analgesia. Despite these interventions, tracheal suctioning can be used in patients who cannot remove secretions. Before suctioning, high oxygen fraction should be used in patients at risk for hypoxemia.",

Patients with COPD may have ineffective cough, increased secretions, and impaired gas exchange after lung resections, especially hypercapnia secondary to hypoventilation. Some patients may need re-intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary rehabilitation includes breathing exercise, cough training, and self-management education; psychosocial support has been shown to decrease complications [12, 13]. Preoperative assessment of these patients for targeting reduces postoperative complications and improves survival. Pneumonia is the most significant postoperative complication that increases morbidity and mortality. These interventions may help reduce the incidence, severity, and risks of pneumonia. Smoking cessation and pharmacological therapies such as bronchodilators, mucolytics, and antibiotics if necessary are useful for patients preparing for lung resection and also those with chronic lung disease.",

Surgical incision, intercostal nerve injury, and inflammation are major causes of pain after thoracic surgery. Thoracic epidural analgesia is still considered the gold standard for pain relief after thoracotomies, but recently some evidence showed that a paravertebral block had a similar analgesic effect with fewer adverse effects than thoracic epidural analgesia [18]. For reduced complications after thoracic surgery, patients should be able to breathe deeply, cough, and remove secretions and should be mobilized early. Postoperative ineffective pain relief associates with worsened pulmonary complications. Belda reported that a higher postoperative pain score was an independent predictor of postoperative respiratory infections [19]. Recently, multimodal analgesia has been preferred for post thoracotomy pain. In this regimen, regional blocks are combined with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, selective cyclooxygenase \u22122 inhibitors, and \u03b12 agonists. Multimodal analgesia is more effective and has fewer adverse effects. When the age and comorbid conditions of these patients are considered, more attention must be paid to the drugs used for analgesia in this population.",

Several studies investigated this issue. Hirakata et al. investigated the airway colonization patterns in patients with primary lung cancer and nonmalignant lung disease and healthy volunteers [27]. The rate of bacterial colonization was significantly higher in patients with lung cancer (51.9 %) than in those with nonmalignant lung disease (37.3 %) and healthy volunteers (37.8 %), and the Gram-negative colonization was higher in this cancer group than in other patient populations. The pathogenesis of airway colonization in patients with lung cancer is not clear, but centrally located tumors and high body mass index were found to be risk factors for colonization [28]. Smoking and poor pulmonary functions also add risk for colonization in patients with COPD. Furthermore, sampling methods that evaluate the incidence of airway colonization are imperative in this patient population.",

Sok demonstrated that postoperative infective complications were caused by Gram-negative bacteria, whereas most of the positive cultures obtained preoperatively were Gram positive [29]. The change in the pattern suggests that the colonization of microorganisms in the early postoperative period may be caused by the aspiration of gastric contents and frequent interventions to the airway in the operating room and ICU. In contrast to these studies, some authors reported a good correlation between microorganisms isolated from patients who developed postoperative pneumonia with the same agents identified preoperatively [1, 19, 21, 30].

In pneumonia developed during late postoperative period, resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria should be considered as potential pathogens. In the early postoperative period (first week), H. influenzae and S. pneumonia are the most common pathogens, but more resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumonia cause pneumonia in the late postoperative period. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with hematologic malignancies, patients who are human immunodeficiency virus positive, and lung transplant recipients is common, but the incidence of CMV infection in other types of cancer patients is not well known. A study performed in a surgical ICU showed that the incidence of CMV infections was around 35.6 % [31]. The essential thing here is to suspect a CMV and make the correct diagnosis, especially in patients under treatment with steroids. Preemptive antiviral therapy is administered in selected patient populations but not in thoracic surgery. Antiviral therapy should be considered for patients with severe pneumonia, ARDS, and resistant to classical antibacterial therapy in postoperative period especially for patients who underwent induction therapy.

If patients have no risk factors for multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDR) such as neoadjuvant therapy, longer entubation time, and steroid therapy aminopenicillin (sulbactam/ampicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime) or narrow-spectrum carbapenem (ertapenem) can be used. If patients have risk factors for MDR, antipseudomonal cephalosporin (cefepime, ceftazidime), or antipseudomonal carbapenem (meropenem, imipenem), \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor (piperacillin/tazobactam) + antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) or aminoglycoside (amikacin, gentamicin) can be used, and if MRSA is suspected, vancomycin or linezolid should be used. Antibiotic therapy is arranged according to culture results and patient clinical status. In recent years there has been an increased incidence of resistance to Acinetobacter spp., which should be taken into account because this bacteria is only susceptible to colimycin.",
