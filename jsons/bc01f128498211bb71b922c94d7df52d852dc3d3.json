With the peak in the new diagnosed patient curve (Figs. 1, 2) , we understood the long patient waiting list outside the hospital needed to be sorted and to be treated at that time in HuBei province. Those with typical CT findings among them, under the guidance of the 5th edition, received timely medical care. This also helped to maximally reduce the risk of community cross infection. After 2 weeks, at time of release of the 6th edition, those big bunch of patients with suspicious COVID-19 infection were successfully collected into hospital. Thus, in the 6th edition, definition of clinical diagnosis was cancelled. Indeed, RT-PCR test is still the most important and is the gold-standard diagnosis for this disease country wide.",

Due to its high sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis, CT is the front line of disease detection at the early clinical stage or even pre-clinical stage. Second, CT findings correlate with the severity of COVID-19 and it is also an important tool to perform fast and accurate follow-up evaluation of the treatment outcome. Feng P developed a CT scoring system to quantitatively estimate the pulmonary involvements and it was related with different disease stages especially between the early stage and the progressive stage [8] . Third, CT is one of the important check points for the definition of disease curation. According to the programme for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (the 6th edition) [3] , improved CT findings should be checked before the patient is to be discharged from the hospital.",

Note that several days following the release of guideline version 5 in 5th February there are several changes, firstly, a steep peak of confirmed case showed up in 12th February due to the use of clinical diagnos-tic criteria, secondly, the number of suspected cases continued to decline, thirdly, the daily cured cases continued to increase.
