            "text": "Interpersonal violence experiences (IPV; sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing violence) and other forms of traumatic events (e.g., traumatic grief, disasters, accidents involving injury) during childhood serve as strong and consistent predictors of substance use problems (SUP) [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]], posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [6], depression [7], and risky sexual behaviors [8,9] during adolescence and adulthood [10,11]. Evidence-based treatments have been developed and evaluated for treating pediatric PTSD and depression among adolescents who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events through individual, office-based approaches [12]. Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) [13], an exposure-based treatment that teaches youth and caregivers skills for managing trauma-related behavioral and emotional problems, is the most widely-disseminated pediatric trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment, with an abundance of RCTs to support its safety, efficacy, and effectiveness with trauma-related mental health concerns [12,14]. Existing treatments for adolescent SUP emphasize teaching youth new cognitive and behavioral skills for responding to internal and external substance use cues and often involve the caregiver in establishing contingencies for achieving and maintaining substance use reductions (e.g., CBT, Motivational Enhancement Therapy with CBT, Multisystemic Therapy [MST], Contingency Management, etc.) [15]. Among youth who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events, substance use may result from feelings of distress in relation to trauma cues and expectancies that using substances will help the young person cope with such distress. Long-standing, siloed approached to treatments for SUP versus mental health problems has resulted in a fragmented set of treatment offerings wherein interventions for substance using populations rarely address common co-occurring mental health disorders, such as PTSD, despite the fact that they may be functionally related [16,17].",

To address the need for an empirically-supported psychosocial therapy for adolescents with co-occurring SUP and PTSD, our team recently completed the first large, sufficiently powered randomized controlled efficacy trial of RRFT, focusing on the SUP and PTSD outcomes [73]. While a concise overview of the Methods specific to those outcomes are included in the published paper, it does not provide a full description of the recruitment and sampling procedures, assessment measures and methods, description of the intervention, and planned statistical approaches to evaluating the full range of outcomes. Thus, the current paper describes the full protocol of this NIH-funded Stage II RCT designed to evaluate the efficacy of RRFT in comparison to treatment as usual in reducing SUP, PTSD, HIV sexual risk behavior, and putative risk mechanisms (e.g., emotion regulation, parenting) among a sample of adolescents who had experienced IPV and other traumatic events who were treated in a \u201creal world\u201d setting.",

Families entering the study after the pilot cases (n = 135) were assigned to either an experimental condition or a control condition. One hundred twenty-four cases were urn randomized to condition (described below in detail) and 11 of these cases were not randomized bur rather assigned to a specific condition either because they had a sibling already enrolled in the study (and a family could not receive both treatments due to contamination factors) (n = 2) or because of case load issues (e.g., if therapists in the control condition were on a wait list and the RRFT clinician had several open slots, it was preferable not to have the participant wait to receive treatment and thus were assigned to RRFT or vice versa) (n = 9). See CONSORT diagram (Insert Figure here). Participants randomized to the experimental condition were assigned to a therapist who was trained and supervised in RRFT. Participants randomized to the control condition received Treatment as Usual (TAU). These treatment conditions are described in greater detail below (see Interventions).",

Statistical power was estimated for the difference between RRFT and TAU in change from baseline to each follow-up assessment. Using G*Power [37], the design effect formula was used to calculate the effective number of independent observations provided by each pair of measurements [36]. Results showed that at an alpha of 0.05 and with 165 independent observations from 124 participants, the study was adequately powered (i.e., power = 0.80) to detect a small-to-medium effect of f = 0.13 for the between-group differences in change.",

This approach to randomization reduces pre-treatment variability between groups on these factors. The urn randomization procedure was implemented using an adaptation of the Microsoft Access application gRand [26] and was set up by the study statistician (JC). To keep assessors blind to condition, participants were urn randomized to the RRFT or TAU conditions by a trained CAC staff member (not a study clinician) using this program immediately following completion the baseline assessment. Specifically, once the Research Assistant screened and consented a new participant entering the study, she or he provided the necessary information to the CAC staff member to enter into the urn to produce the condition assignment. Specifically, condition assignment was balanced based on pre-treatment PTSDs severity (score on UCLA-PTSD-RI [[24], [25], [26]] \u2265 38), frequency of pretreatment substance use (\u22654 substance using days over past 30 days); and the gender of the adolescent. Once the condition was identified, the CAC staff member informed the PI and the TAU supervisor of the condition assignment. The PI (for RRFT assignment) or the TAU supervisor (for TAU assignment) would then determine therapist assignment (based on case load and participant schedule match) and then inform the clinician about the new client.",

For example, the youth and caregivers work with the therapist to determine what maintaining factors (\u201cdrivers\u201d) contribute to a given risk behavior at each level of their ecology (e.g., substance use as a coping strategy; low parental monitoring; substance-using peers) and how those drivers can be modified to reduce substance use and promote emotional resilience (e.g., teach positive coping skills, involve other family members or neighbors for monitoring, connect the youth with structured activities that provide a forum for meeting non-using peers).",

According to this theory, fear is acquired through a classical conditioning process by which the individual pairs a neutral stimulus (e.g., the dark; a certain word/smell) with a stimulus that invokes a fear response (e.g., sexual assault) - such that the neutral stimulus elicits the fear/distress response in the absence of the feared stimulus. Change occurs through exposure therapy, as individuals can reduce a fear response during exposure to the feared stimuli without the feared aversive consequences. Based on its adaptation from TF-CBT, RRFT includes gradual exposure therapy to address PTSD symptoms via the development of a detailed written or verbal account of the IPV experiences and other traumatic events. As part of this exposure-based trauma narrative work, cognitive-behavioral therapy also is involved, where the therapist helps adolescents identify and replace inaccurate and/or unhelpful beliefs that they have developed in relation to the traumatic events (e.g., \u201cI am damaged goods\u201d; \u201cThe abuse was my fault\u201d; \u201cI am unlovable\u201d; \u201cBeing high is the only way to deal with what happened.\u201d) Skill-building in the area of coping (e.g., emotional reactivity) is an important preamble to the exposure work and is accomplished by teaching distress tolerance and relaxation skills.",

Therapists are encouraged to engage in brief phone or SMS/text check-ins with families between sessions to promote treatment engagement, particularly when new skills have been taught or during times of family crisis.

Thus, given the ethical need to provide treatment to the control group (adolescents with current substance use and clinically significant PTSD symptoms) and a deficiency of information regarding how to address the heterogeneous clinical needs of this population, TAU was selected as the most appropriate comparison condition for this study.",

Second, all therapy sessions across both conditions were audio-taped to measure therapist adherence to RRFT and to characterize TAU. The audio recordings of 20% of sessions across both conditions (560 sessions total) were coded by 3 raters trained to >80% inter-rater reliability. Tapes were coded using the Family Therapy Scale from the Therapy Procedures Checklist [38], which is an assessment of techniques used in session (e.g., improving family communication patterns), and an RRFT Therapist Adherence Measure (RRFT-TAM) [39]. The RRFT-TAM was developed using guidelines from the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing [40] and accompanying Rasch methods [41]. Because RRFT represents an integration of TF-CBT for PTSD and MST for SUP, the RRFT-TAM was designed to capture key features of those models.

The data are structured with five repeated measurements (level-1) nested within participants (level-2). To address this, the primary statistical models will be implemented as mixed-effects regression models [61], with continuous outcomes analyzed according to a normal sampling distribution and discrete outcomes analyzed using Bernoulli (dichotomous), negative binomial (count), or ordinal (ordered categories) sampling distributions. Primary outcomes focus on substance using days and PTSD symptom severity, with secondary outcomes targeting marijuana use and marijuana using days, alcohol use and alcohol using days, and polysubstance use (i.e., the use of at least two different substances). Sexual risk behaviors, as measured by the Sexual Risk Behavior Scale [56], are secondary outcomes that will be evaluated as well. To model change over time, polynomials and/or time-related indicators will be entered at the level of repeated measurements. For instance, by including linear and quadratic polynomials, the model would estimate an instantaneous rate of change that, over time, can slow down or speed up. Alternatively, more basic formulations, such as the use of dummy-coded indicators for the post-baseline assessments, could test for change between baseline and each subsequent assessment occasion. The effect of RRFT will be tested using a dummy-coded indicator for intervention condition (0 = TAU, 1 = RRFT), which will be entered at participant-level along with cross-level interactions between condition and the level-1 time term(s). Significance testing will be based on the Wald test (i.e., \u03b2/SE), and tests that are not directly provided by this formulation (e.g., the significance of within-group change for RRFT) will be obtained using planned contrasts. A number of potential control variables will be considered. For instance, at level-1, an indicator may be included for treatment status at each measurement occasion. This would test for an overall shift in the level of the outcome trajectory following the end of treatment. Likewise, at level-2, variables may be included to control for participant demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, race) and/or indicators of treatment intensity (e.g., duration, frequency). The models will be implemented using SuperMix [61] or similar software for mixed-effects regression models.",

This study was conducted to address a significant gap in the field with regard to integrative treatment for co-occurring SUP, PTSD, and related problems (e.g., HIV sexual risk behavior) among adolescents. That is, although significant progress has been made in treating trauma-related psychopathology among adolescents and in treating SUP among adolescents independently, significantly less is known about treatment of SUP and PTSD in an integrative fashion among adolescents who have experienced IPV and other traumatic events.",

Given that post-treatment substance use relapse rates are high, including among youth [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]], assessments that extend to the year following treatment are critical in determining whether gains are indeed maintained after treatment. A substantial strength of the Stage II trial was that it included 12- and 18-month post baseline assessments to determine if indeed RRFT was successful in targeting long-term improvements in SUP and PTSD symptoms, as well as sexual risk behaviors.",

First, this study focuses on a \u2018real world\u2019 population of adolescents\u2014where the focus was on heterogeneous symptoms (e.g., current substance use, PTSD symptoms), rather than requiring meeting full diagnostic criteria (e.g., severe substance use disorder + PTSD diagnosis). This ensures the study results will generalize to a broader population of youth who are highly vulnerable for the wide range of negative sequelae that can follow IPV and other traumatic event experiences. The multi-faceted clinical needs of this population call for an innovative solution to bridge the gap between early intervention and treatment, resulting in an inclusive risk-reduction approach with the potential for a wider-spread impact. Second, establishing an integrative treatment option for this population directly addresses issues related to client burden (having to navigate separate, parallel or sequential treatments for SUP and PTSD delivered by different therapists in different settings) and clinician preferences [72] to have tools to address the multi-faceted problems most representative of their clients. Third, the Stage II trial affords a unique opportunity to pursue mechanisms of action research, which can direct improvements to treatment models and inform important next steps in this line of research. As noted in the Methods, we assessed several empirically-informed skills specifically targeted in RRFT (e.g., emotional regulation; parenting) that may lead to improvements in SUP and PTSD.",
