Climate change-related reductions in land productivity and habitability and in food and water security can also interact with demographic, economic and social factors to increase migration. In addition to migration, climate change has also implications for travel and the risk of disease. This article discusses the impact of climate change on migration and travel with implications for public health practice. Methods: Literature review. Results: Migrants may be at increased risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases, due to factors in their country of origin and their country of destination or conditions that they experience during migration. Although migration has not been a significant driver of communicable disease outbreaks to date, public health authorities need to ensure that effective screening and vaccination programmes for priority communicable diseases are in place. Population growth coupled with socio-economic development is increasing travel and tourism, and advances in technology have increased global connectivity and reduced the time required to cover long distances. At the same time, as a result of climate change, many temperate regions, including high-income countries, are now suitable for vector-borne disease transmission. This is providing opportunities for importation of vectors and pathogens from endemic areas that can lead to cases or outbreaks of communicable diseases with which health professionals may be unfamiliar. Conclusion: Health systems need to be prepared for the potential population health consequences of migration, travel and tourism and the impact of climate change on these. Integrated surveillance, early detection of cases and other public health interventions are critical to protect population health and prevent and control communicable disease outbreaks.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Travel medicine will increasingly see the health consequences of significant changes associated with global change, particularly climate change and socioeconomic development. Together these changes mean more opportunities for people to travel to pathogen-endemic countries and for pathogens to be imported to new locations, with the potential for unexpected communicable disease cases and outbreaks. Moreover, people who migrate or are displaced can also be at increased risk for chronic disease and mental health issues. Thus, travel medicine needs to take a broader perspective than just asking patients where they are going or where they have been, considering how the ongoing and projected shifts in the magnitude and pattern of disease could affect the health and well-being of individuals and populations.

It also concluded that climate change will continue to increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events globally and the risk of drought in the Mediterranean region specifically (medium confidence). Climate change is a long-term process, but the extent to which individual weather events are influenced by climate change can increasingly be estimated. 2, 3 Migration The greatest human migration started 60 000 or 70 000 years ago when Homo sapiens left Africa for other parts of the world 4-7 ; a series of 'mega-droughts' may have contributed to this. [6] [7] [8] Migration has continued since and has become a defining characteristic of our times, affecting every inhabited continent. Migrants may move internally, settle in neighbouring countries or move to other continents. Currently, Europe, North America and Oceania are the main destinations for migrants although, overall, Europe and Asia have received the greatest number of migrants in recent decades. 9 Migration has political, social, economic, cultural, environmental and public health implications. Migrants generally contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in benefits.

In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants to support a comprehensive approach to migration. These international accords were also thematically linked to other major international agreements, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 15 ,16 The drivers of migration are complex and include political, economic, social, cultural and environmental factors (Figure 1 ). These same factors can determine whether migration is permanent or temporary. The drivers of migration can be grouped into five categories 17-19 : 1) Push factors that force people to migrate including war, unemployment, food scarcity, over-population or prosecution. 2) Pull factors that attract people to a new destination including work and educational opportunities, political or religious freedom. 3) Network drivers that facilitate the migration process such family ties, social support, kinship, safety and feasibility of transport. 4) National policies that allow or prohibit migration. 5) Personal aspirations and motivations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 259, "end": 261, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 675, "end": 681, "text": "15 ,16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 947, "end": 954, "text": "17-19 :", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 270, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 795, "end": 804, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Climate change"}, {"text": "These drivers are often interconnected and situation specific ( Figure 1 ). They can also interact with climate change, which can itself be a trigger for migration ( Figure 2 ). 20, 21 Although environmental drivers do not appear to have been the most significant contributor to international migration to date, 22, 23 migration in response to the consequences of climate change can be a pragmatic adaption strategy that balances the risks of staying and the risks of moving. 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] For example, for the Tonga-speaking people in Southern Zambia, migration is an adaptation strategy to climate variability when the availability of water affects both agricultural production and livestock survival. 28 Additional warming of 0.5 \u2022 C is projected to further exacerbate climate-related drivers of migration; studies suggest that an increase in extreme weather and climate events and disasters associated with climate change could trigger an increase in migration. [29] [30] [31] [32] Climate change impacts on migration and health. The complex and multiple drivers of migration mean that it is difficult to attribute specific migrations to climate change (Figures 1 and  2) . As a result, projections of migration associated with climate change vary widely, ranging from 50 million to 200 million, with these numbers based on extrapolations. 27, 33 In 2018, a World Bank report on the impact of climate change on migration estimated that by 2050-in just three regions-climate change could force more than 143 million people to move within their countries. 34 Table 2 summarizes the World Bank findings from three case studies in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia), South Asia (Bangladesh) and Latin America (Mexico).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 181, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 182, "end": 184, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 312, "end": 315, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 316, "end": 318, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 476, "end": 479, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 480, "end": 484, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 485, "end": 489, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 490, "end": 494, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 495, "end": 499, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 714, "end": 716, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 976, "end": 980, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 981, "end": 985, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 991, "end": 995, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1357, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1360, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1570, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 64, "end": 72, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 166, "end": 174, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1185, "text": "(Figures 1 and  2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1578, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Climate change"}, {"text": "Evidence for the possible role of climate change on migration comes from different sources (Figure 1 and 2) . These include studies of the extent to which 'temperature and precipitation' are associated with out-migration. For example, in recent decades, temperature had a statistically significant effect on out-migration from agriculture-dependent countries. 35 There is a nexus between climate change and migration in that temperature and precipitation are positively associated with migration: a 1 \u2022 C increase in average temperature in the sending country is associated with a 1.9% increase in bilateral migration flows; an additional millimeter of average annual precipitation is associated with an increase in migration of 0.5%. 36 Another study suggests that an increase in precipitation anomalies from the long-term mean may also be associated with an increase in out-migration. 37 Under a moderate climate change scenario, if global mean temperature rises by 2 \u2022 C, tropical populations would have to move considerable distances in order find places where temperatures are similar to those in places they currently live in and to preserve their annual mean temperatures. 38 'Extreme weather events' linked to climate change, such as heat waves, droughts, storms, floods and wildfires, cause shortterm population displacement ( Figure 2 ). In 2017, disastersmost of which were related to extreme weather-displaced 18.8 million people in 135 countries ( Figure 3 ). 9 In 2018, California Only low-income countries show marked increases in population under SPP4. b The higher number of climate migrants under the more climate-friendly scenario in Ethiopia is in part driven by the regional climate models, which project lower water availability by 2050 in general compared with the other two scenarios (pessimistic reference and more inclusive development scenarios), which are coupled with higher emissions. experienced the most destructive wildfire season on record with more than 81,000 people being evacuated from their homes. 39 A number of factors led to these fires, including accumulated natural fuel and compounding atmospheric conditions that were linked to climate change. 40 Based on the experience of other events in the USA, some people will eventually return to their communities, but others will permanently relocate. For example, following Hurricane Katrina, it was estimated that between 37% and 54% of the population returned, 41 with young adults being more likely to have moved further away. 41 ,42 In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew in Florida, 76% of displaced residents relocated within the same county, 18% moved within the state and 6% moved out of state. 43 In some cases, extreme weather events can cause longerterm migration. For example, an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts in Tanzania has killed livestock and forced the Maasai people to migrate from rural to urban settings, with documented implications for their mental health. 44 Similarly, prior to the Syrian migrant crisis in 2015, the Fertile Crescent was affected by a severe and sustained drought associated with anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gas emissions 45 and this, combined with unsustainable agricultural and environmental practices, contributed to internal migration, political instability and conflict and eventually to an exodus of one million migrants to Europe. 46 'River flooding and erosion' has adversely affected agriculture in Bangladesh and resulted in population migration to India ( Figure 2 ). 47 Climate change models project an increased frequency and likelihood of severe storms, with implications for sea level and flooding, in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, and this is likely to displace a large number of people. 48 In Pakistan, the adverse economic impact of heat waves on agricultural and non-agricultural activity has increased outmigration. 49 In contrast, flooding in Pakistan was not associated with significantly increased migration, possibly due to the larger scale of the response by relief agencies to floods compared with heat waves. 49 In other regions, food scarcity due to flooding has contributed to internal migration. In 2018 in Mali, flooding destroyed fields, damaged grain stores and impeded livestock production and, as a result, an estimated 4.6 million people are food insecure and 77 000 internally displaced.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 735, "end": 737, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 887, "end": 889, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1182, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2039, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2190, "end": 2192, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2454, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2525, "text": "41 ,42", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2687, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2983, "end": 2985, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3177, "end": 3179, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3395, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3534, "end": 3536, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3766, "end": 3768, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3898, "end": 3900, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 4098, "end": 4100, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 107, "text": "(Figure 1 and 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1344, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1469, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3530, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Climate change"}, {"text": "'Gradual changes' due to climate change, such as changing rainfall patterns, rise in sea level, increased salinization and decreased soil fertility, can also be a driver for migration ( Figure 2 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 194, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Climate change"}, {"text": "practice.

[56] [57] [58] Epidemic intelligence data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) suggests that migration is a relatively infrequent driver of communicable disease threat events in Europe, compared with travel and tourism. 59, 60 There was no evidence during the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe that migrants posed a risk to European Union citizens from communicable diseases, 61 and despite the barriers to accessing immunization that migrants experience, the contribution of migrants to the current measles outbreaks in Europe is minimal. 62 However, migrants may be at increased risk of communicable disease due to exposure or conditions during migration and in the country of destination (Table 3) . 29, 61, 63, [64] [65] [66] [67] For example, there is evidence that tuberculosis transmission occurs on migration routes to Europe, including during long-term stays in refugee camps. 68 Overcrowded and inadequate refugee camps, detention centres and housing can spread vectors (e.g. lice and fleas) that transmit diseases such as relapsing fever, trench fever and epidemic or murine typhus. 61 Poor and overcrowded living conditions can also increase the risk of respiratory diseases, such as seasonal influenza. 69 Migrants living in overcrowded conditions with poor sanitation may also be at risk of cholera outbreaks. 70 Overcrowding, poor sanitation and limited access to health services can also facilitate the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among migrants, particularly refugees and asylum seekers. 71 Migrants may be at increased risk of communicable disease in their country of destination due to factors including lack of vaccination, low socioeconomic status and poor living conditions and limited access to health care (Table 3) . 69 Recent evidence from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), based on CD4 cell counts and HIV-RNA trajectories from seroconversion also suggests that migrants may be at risk of HIV transmission in their country of destination; two-thirds of a sample of HIV-positive migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean acquired their HIV infection in the country of destination. 72 Essential public health measures include ensuring adequate living conditions, access to health care in refugee camps, detention centres, screening for communicable diseases and assessment Offer serological screening and treatment (for those found to be positive) to all migrants from countries of high endemicity in sub-Saharan Africa and focal areas of transmission in Asia, South America and North Africa.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 196, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 400, "end": 402, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 798, "end": 801, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 802, "end": 804, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 950, "end": 952, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1116, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1280, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1284, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1288, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1293, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1298, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1303, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1308, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1462, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1670, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1792, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1900, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2097, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2334, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2749, "end": 2751, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1265, "end": 1274, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2329, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Climate change impacts on migration: implications for public health"}, {"text": "Offer serological screening and treatment (for those found to be positive) for strongyloidiasis to all migrants from countries of high endemicity in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Oceania and Latin America.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strongyloidiasis"}, {"text": "Offer vaccination against MMR to all migrant children and adolescents without immunization records as a priority.

In Europe, a warmer climate appears to be associated with more frequent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya 81 are projected to become more suitable for onward transmission of the chikungunya pathogen. 82 Climate change may have contributed to the explosive spread of Zika in Brazil. 83 The epidemic was preceded by 'record warmest' climatic conditions, accompanied by a severe drought. 84 The utilization of home water storage containers during the drought might have provided breeding sites for Aedes mosquitoes and increased exposure to mosquitoes. Virus importation into a susceptible population could then have triggered the epidemic. 83 Precipitation, another important environmental factor affected by climate change, also influences the availability of conditions suitable for mosquito vectors. For example, heavy rainfall increases the abundance of A. albopictus and, hence, the risk of transmission of dengue and chikungunya. 85 Climate change can increase the risk of other vector-borne diseases, including tick-borne and rodent-borne infections, 85 and can also influence the range, seasonality and incidence of water-borne diseases such as cholera. 86, 87 Global air travel may facilitate the spread of 'resistant pathogens'. For example, it is thought to have facilitated the rapid dissemination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the UK and North America across Europe and then to Asia. 88 Vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae followed a similar trajectory. 88 The burden of antibiotic resistance in destination countries can also be exacerbated by climate change, because an increase in ambient temperature is associated with a significant increase in antibiotic resistance for common pathogens, including K. pneumoniae and S. aureus. 89 It is hypothesized that temperature accelerates horizontal transfer of resistance genes or the uptake of genetic material. Ambient temperature may also facilitate environmental growth of resistant strains and enhance transmission from food, agriculture and environmental sources. 89 Climate change impacts on travel: implications for public health practice. Air travel can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases around the globe. Passenger volume has been identified as a significant driver of the importation of viremic passengers. 90, 91 Flights directly connect millions of passengers between Europe and Asia, Africa, North America and South America, with many of these locations 'hot spots' for the emergence of communicable diseases. 92 A disease outbreak in one part of the world can quickly spread to another part via air travel. 59, 60 For example, in-flight transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 resulted in the rapid spread of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) around the world. 93 International air travellers departing from Mexico in 2009 unknowingly carried and disseminated the novel influenza virus A(H1N1)v around the world. 94 Similarly, air transport networks contributed to the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome from Saudi Arabia in 2012, chikungunya dispersion in the Americas in 2013, Ebola from West Africa in 2014 and Zika spread in the Americas in 2015. [95] [96] [97] [98] More specifically, air travel can increase the risk of importation of pathogens from endemic areas into regions with competent mosquito vectors and suitable climatic and environmental conditions for vector-borne diseases. 90 Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is a significant public health concern, threatening almost half of the world's population. 99 Table 5 .

In addition, certain pathogens, such as the West Nile virus, can persist in stored blood components and subsequently cause infection through intravenous application.
