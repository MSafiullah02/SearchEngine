A possible explanation may be that older children are more frequently exposed to virus infections than infants, due to more frequent contact with other children in various settings, including the parent's social activities and day care. The majority of children over 12 months of age attend day care in Sweden. The age for admission to day care and the percentages of children attending day care could be factors that vary between different countries and contribute to different findings in studies of single and multiple infections. If older children are indeed exposed to more viruses, this may lead to more frequent sequential infections, and the presence of virus from one infection may be more likely to overlap the next viral infection.",

There is incomplete knowledge about the duration of shedding of respiratory viruses as determined by molecular techniques. Kaiser et al. 22 demonstrated that HCoV\u2010NL63 was still detectable 3 weeks after the initial infection, and there are indications that HBoV is frequently shed for prolonged periods with ensuing diagnostic problems 23, 24. Asymptomatic carriage of rhinovirus is well known, and shedding may occur for weeks 25. The significance of a rhinovirus finding in a child with acute respiratory infection is therefore often unclear in the individual case. However, for most respiratory viruses such as RSV, asymptomatic carriage has not been considered common, and hence is not a likely explanation for multiple pathogens in respiratory specimens. RSV, influenza and hMPV appear in epidemics that often overlap. Thus, sequential infections may be the main mechanism behind multiple virus detection.",
