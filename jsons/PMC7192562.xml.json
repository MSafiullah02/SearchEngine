            "text": "Among the many ways that social distancing can impact the health and vulnerability of GBQT2+, we are particularly concerned of how their social and mental health might be impacted. In fact, among 6198 GBQT2+ who participated in the 2019 Sex Now Survey, over one-in-five GBQT2+ (21%) had Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item [22; PHQ-2] depression scores greater than clinical screening thresholds and 29% self-reported having \u201cFair\u201d or \u201cPoor\u201d mental health overall. Further, a staggering 57% of respondents wanted help with a mental health problem they were facing. Notably, of those who wanted help with a mental health problem, 19% wanted help dealing with suicidal thoughts. These statistics are alarming considering that we also see a dose\u2013response relationship between the number of people GBQT2+ can turn to for support and the proportion who have depression symptoms and the proportion who want help dealing with suicidal thoughts. If social distancing prevents people from accessing these supports, it may contribute to worse mental health outcomes, potentially even suicide. In addition to the effects on social distancing, economic impacts may also harm GBQT2+ and their mental health. In Sex Now 2019, only one third (33%) of GBQT2+ reported having \u201cextra\u201d money and 10% reported not being able to \u201cmake ends meet.\u201d Recent national research in Canada highlighted that half of LGBTQ2+ households (52%, compared with 39% of households overall) have experienced lay-offs or reduced employment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [23].",

As a baseline, 51% of Sex Now 2019 respondents reported meeting new sexual partners in the past three months, with two-thirds of these individuals having had sex with a new partner in the past 4 weeks (and 15% of all respondents reporting sex with a new partner in the week they completed the survey). While some people, including GBQT2+, will undoubtedly continue to connect in-person with sexual partners during the COVID-19 pandemic, we know that the apps and websites are also used for online sexual acts. With 32% of GBQT2+ reporting camming or sexting online\u2014it would suggest that at least some GBQT2+ may be able to find safe ways to fulfill their sexual needs while social distancing. It remains unclear whether these online encounters will fulfill the intimacy and connection needs of GBQT2+ men.",

            "text": "Social distancing is likely to have additional consequences with respect to antiretroviral medication adherence and implications as a result of changes in sexual health care. Beyond issues of delayed or missed diagnoses of STIs, especially asymptomatic ones, a lack of STI screening also means that clinical eligibility for PrEP [24] will be limited if rectal STIs or syphilis are not diagnosed. Regarding PrEP, 86% of HIV-negative GBQT2+ on PrEP reported daily use. Fortunately, if access to PrEP is made difficult by increased burden on the healthcare system or if individuals are worried about accessing health services to get their prescription fulfilled these individuals might be able to switch to on demand regimens (only 11% were currently taking it on demand), but this may not provide adequate HIV prevention during sex if sexual frequency is very low. Issues with antiretroviral adherence for people living with HIV may also be impacted by a lack of physical access to healthcare providers and peer navigators [25]. In Sex Now, there were already indications of sub-optimal adherence among people living with HIV: 33% reported having missed a dose in the past 4 weeks alone. Disruptions to regular habits and schedules as well as potential challenges to medication access could compound these problems.",
