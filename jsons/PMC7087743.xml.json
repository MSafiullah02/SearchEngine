Recently, bats have become a focus of attention as possible reservoirs of several emerging pathogens, including SARS-like viruses (Li et al. 2005), and other Corona viruses (Dominguez et al. 2007; Gloza-Rausch et al. 2008), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Joharra et al. 2001; Halpin et al. 2000), Ebola virus (Leroy et al. 2005), Herpes virus (Wibbelt et al. 2007), and others (reviewed in Calisher et al. 2006). Bats also have long been recognized as reservoir hosts, and vectors to humans and domestic animals, of rabies virus (Messenger et al. 2003; Constantine 1967) and related lyssaviruses (Fraser et al. 1996; Botvinkin et al. 2003). However, little is known about variation in immune function and susceptibility to disease in free-ranging bats (Calisher et al. 2006; Dobson 2005; but see Christe et al. 2000). Improving our understanding of variation in immune function among individuals and populations of bats is important for understanding the role of bats as potential vectors of emerging diseases (Messenger et al. 2003; Dobson 2005).",

            "text": "Bats possess a variety of life-history traits that are likely to affect their immune function and the role of bats as reservoirs and vectors of disease (Calisher et al. 2006). Many species are colonial, although considerable variation in colony size exists (Kunz 1982; O\u2019Shea and Bogan 2003). The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida\nbrasiliensis), for example, roosts in some of the largest aggregations of mammals on earth, with several thousand to several million individual bats estimated to form maternity colonies in caves and under highway bridges (Davis et al. 1962; McCracken 2003; Keeley and Keeley 2004; Betke et al. 2008). Colonial living brings the possibility of increased exposure to infectious pathogens, with direct links to immune defense and protection. Relationships have been shown between coloniality and immune responsiveness in several avian species, although evidence is conflicting. For example, Tella et al. (2001) found that T cell mediated immune response in fledglings of the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) was negatively correlated with colony size, whereas M\u00f8ller et al. (2001), examining immunity at the interspecific level, found that highly colonial swallows and martins, have higher levels of T and B cell response compared to less social songbirds.",

Roosts can differ in structure, capacity and possible quality (Lausen and Barclay 2006; Neubaum et al. 2006).

The innate and adaptive arms of the immune response interact to protect individuals, although their competence may vary among individuals (Blount et al. 2003). Most previous research on the effects of ecological conditions on immune function has focused primarily on the adaptive immune response (but see Tieleman et al. 2005 and Blount et al. 2003), by estimating T cell proliferation in response to mitogenic challenge (Tella et al. 2001; Tella et al. 2002).

Bactericidal activity of whole blood in culture, one aspect of the innate immune response, primarily measures complement-mediated cytotoxicity (Merchant et al. 2003), which is a major factor in defense against viruses (Blue et al. 2004). T cell mediated response, which contains aspects of both innate and adaptive immune components, is also important in clearance of viruses, including rabies virus (Hooper et al. 1998). This study was designed to characterize responses of T. brasiliensis to two immune challenges. We postulated that variation in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system would be affected by differences in roosting ecology as it relates to roost environment and colony size.",

Periods of data collection corresponded to female reproductive stages: pregnancy (May\u2013June); lactation (June\u2013July); post-lactation/non-reproductive (August\u2013September). Earlier studies indicated that mating in T. brasiliensis occurs prior to spring migration (Davis et al. 1962; Cockrum 1969), though recent evidence suggests that mating also occurs in Texas in March and April (Keeley and Keeley 2004). Outside of the mating season, however, many of these roosts are occupied by non-territorial maternity colonies, comprised mostly of females. Thus, we have focused on adult females in the present study.",

This technique has been used successfully as an in vitro assay of innate immune function in free-ranging animals (Tieleman et al. 2005). A small amount of whole blood (6 \u03bcl) was collected in sterile heparinized capillary tubes via venopuncture (Kunz and Nagy 1988) within 2 h of capture from each bat. Although Matson et al. (2006) found a decrease in bactericidal ability of the blood of several species of birds at this length of time post-capture, preliminary data on T. brasiliensis shows no reduction in bactericidal ability up to 2 h post-capture. The blood was diluted to 1:50 in RPMI-1640 media (Roswell Park Memorial Institute), supplemented with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). The E. coli (ATCC 8739; Microbiologics, USA) solution was diluted to 1:1,000 using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A total of 140 \u03bcl of diluted blood was mixed with 10 \u03bcl of diluted bacteria. Once mixed, 50 \u03bcl of the combined blood and bacterial dilution was spread onto labeled trypticase soy agar plates (BD Diagnostic systems, USA) at both 0 and 60 min post-mixing. Two control plates consisted of 5% FBS in RPMI with equivalently diluted bacteria and no blood. All plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 h, after which colonies of E. coli were visually counted and recorded. The unit-less index used to calculate the bactericidal ability of the blood was standardized for both controls of a given assay:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{BKA\\;index}} = - 1 \\times \\left( {\\left( {\\frac{\\text{blood\\;plate\\;60 - blood\\;plate\\;0}}{\\text{blood\\;plate\\;0}} \\times 1 0 0} \\right) - \\left( {\\frac{\\text{control\\;60 - control\\;0}}{\\text{control\\;0}} \\times 1 0 0} \\right)} \\right) $$\\end{document}This index assigned large positive values when bats had blood with high cytotoxic activity and negative values when blood had little or no cytotoxic activity against the bacteria.

Only data from assays where there was less than a 15% difference between the 0 and 60 min controls were used. Three individuals whose bactericidal indices were over three standard deviations lower than the mean of the remaining individuals were excluded from the data set, because these values deviated from the normal distribution of bactericidal ability found in our samples.

Injections were administered in the interfemoral membrane (uropatagium) below the knee at the point of contact with the leg. Prior to injection, the area was measured with a digital micrometer (Mitutuyo #293-230, Japan). The experimental area on each bat was injected with 0.05 ml of 3 mg/ml PHA in PBS. As a control, the contralateral side was then injected with 0.05 ml of PBS. Swelling at the sites of injection was subsequently measured at 12 hours post-challenge. Measurements of PHA swellings in the uropatagium of bats are very similar to the more common measurements made in the wing web of birds. The swelling produces thickened cellular infiltrate between the two layers of skin adjacent to the leg, thus our measurements are comparable in execution to those conducted in birds. Although bactericidal ability of blood was not tested in every bat, all bats were bled within 3 min of capture, for a companion study on stress hormones, therefore all bats in our study were bled once prior to PHA challenge. To ensure consistency in assessing the PHA test, one of us (L.C.A.) performed all injections, and another (A.S.T.) made all measurements. Care was taken to conduct repeatable, blind measurements with each swelling measured twice and averaged. Following Navara et al. (2005), the unit-less index below was used to determine the swelling response to the mitogenic challenge standardized against the control response:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{PHA\\;index}} = \\frac{{\\left( { 1 2 {\\text{hrPHA}} - 1 2 {\\text{hrPBS}}} \\right)}}{{\\left( {\\frac{{{\\text{prePHA}} + {\\text{prePBS}}}}{ 2}} \\right)}} $$\\end{document}Indices greater than one designate bats with marked T cell infiltration to the injection area, whereas smaller index values indicate that little or no response was observed.

In a separate group of T. brasiliensis (N = 18), we analyzed PHA treated and control tissues with biopsies of the swellings taken 6\u201321 h post-challenge. We documented significantly larger numbers of lymphocytes (mean cell count = 6), as well as heterophils (mean cell count = 35), in PHA-challenged tissues that were not observed in any numbers in control tissues, demonstrating that specific cellular infiltration had occurred in response to the PHA challenge. We found that measurements of the swellings at 12-h post-injection capture the maximal swelling response of individual bats, and represented when increased lymphocyte and heterophil infiltration occurred (Turmelle and Mendon\u00e7a, unpublished data). The immune response to PHA challenge in bats suggests that both innate and adaptive components are responsible for local swelling at the injection site, as was found in birds by Martin et al. (2006a). Because PHA elicits T-lymphocyte response at the site of injection, this method is a good overall measure of cell-mediated immune function in this species.",

Because we were only able to sample four colonies, a nested design was used (comparing roost types, with colony nested within roost type) to examine if there is significant variation in roost types beyond variation due to differences among colonies alone. Roost type, and colony nested within roost type were independent variables and body condition, a ratio of body mass to right forearm length, was a covariate in the overall model. We also treated colony as a random effect (i.e., we are interested in generalizing to other colonies of Brazilian free-tailed bats); roost type (bridge or cave), a fixed effect, was tested over colony nested within roost type. Because colony size varies with roost type (the majority of cave colonies, including those studied here, have more bats living in them than bridge colonies), we were unable to directly test for the effects of population size on immune function, but we will explore this hypothesis in our discussion below. Lastly, we tested for a linear association between bactericidal ability and the log-transformed T cell response data, within individuals subjected to both assays (n = 74), using Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation (\u03b1 = 0.05).",

This trend is also present when roost types are compared; suggesting that there are inherent differences between bridges and caves that likely affect immunity. Although this result is not linked to body condition, there may be additional factors that affect innate immunity which are not included in our model. One possible factor could be differences in ectoparasitism among the colonies surveyed. High parasite loads affect immune function adversely in a variety of vertebrates (Sheldon and Verhulst 1996; M\u00f8ller et al. 1999). Examination of infestations of ectoparasitic mites on T. brasiliensis at these same sites show that individuals at Davis Cave, the site with the lowest mean BKA index, had the highest degree of mite cover, followed by individuals at Frio Cave and then at bridge sites (Turmelle 2005). Although these types of immune responses are not directly related, we suggest that higher parasitism of bats in the colony at Davis Cave may reflect a weakened immune system overall; however, the exact causative mechanisms are currently unknown. Research on the relationships between ectoparasitism and immune responses in T. brasiliensis is in progress.",

            "text": "The lower T cell responses in females occupying bridges compared to their cave-dwelling counterparts indicates that adaptive immune response is also influenced by roost type (Fig. 1b). This supports our hypothesis that environmental differences may exist between roost types. Bats living in bridges may experience physiological stress associated with living in man-made roosts that negatively impact adaptive immune responses. As reviewed by Nelson et al. (2000) immune suppression associated with stress hormones has been demonstrated in several species of vertebrates. Notwithstanding, evidence linking stress hormone levels and immune system function in the Brazilian free-tailed bat is currently lacking. Alternatively, this pattern may also reflect differences in colony size between the roost types. While our model does not directly test for the effects of colony size on swelling response to PHA, a post-hoc test shows a positive correlation (P < 0.0001, F = 19.79(3,161), R\n2 = 0.11; Fig. 3) between mean PHA response and the best current estimates of colony size (Betke et al. 2008). Because colony size varied with roost type, and the effects of both variables may be working in combination, additional research will be needed to tease apart these effects. Similarly, in an interspecific study M\u00f8ller et al. (2001) found that highly colonial swallows and martins had more robust T cell responses compared to less social songbirds, and they suggested that higher levels of parasitism observed in larger colonies may cause individuals to allocate more resources to combat infection. Tella et al. (2001), found the opposite relationship, examining colonies of the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), with larger colonies having reduced T cell responses compared to smaller ones. The authors point out that density dependent food limitations and crowding negatively affected body condition and immunocompetence in fledglings. Since we found PHA response to increase with colony size, it is likely that these bats may not be particularly sensitive to crowding and food limitations.\n",

            "text": "Because the adaptive arm of the immune system responds to chronic infection (Klasing 2004), greater investment in immunity is expected in organisms threatened by a larger number of pathogens (Read and Allen 2000). Evidence suggests that bats in caves have higher ectoparasite loads than those roosting beneath bridges (Turmelle 2005). Differences in exposures to other pathogens may also vary by roost type. For example, once the spores of Histoplasma capsulatum and other fungi that grow in the accumulated guano below bats become airborne they can infect lungs and mucosal membranes (McMurray and Russel 1982). Resistance to H. capsulatum infection in mammals is dependent on a cellular immune response primarily mediated by T cells (Cain and Deepe 1998; Deepe 1994). One critical determinant of the course of infection is the inflammatory response evoked in response to host-pathogen interactions. The inability to evoke the appropriate inflammatory response can lead to disease progression. Compared to bats roosting in caves, bats roosting under bridges may be less exposed to fungi due to smaller accumulations of guano and greater air circulation between the guano and the roosting bats. Thus, we expect that higher pressures from parasites and fungi in caves may result in cave-roosting bats investing more energy in mounting memory-related, adaptive, resistance to the pathogens they commonly face. These findings are in contrast with those of Christe et al. (2000) who found that reproductive females of Myotis myotis had lower T cell responsiveness and higher mite loads than non-reproductive females, and that during lactation immunocompetence was positively correlated with body mass. In the current study, we found no evidence for differences in T cell response due to body condition or reproductive stage. Moreover, we found evidence for a positive relationship between ectoparasitic mite loads and T cell response, although this pattern may be indirect owing to differences in roosting condition in bridge and cave-roosting bats.",

Our data suggests that individuals may not be able to maximally activate all aspects of immunity owing to competing costs and the variety of strategies associated with a multiple-component immune system (Klasing 2004).

The infection cycle for these arboviruses occurs primarily between birds and arthropods, with incidental infection of mammals generally not producing significant viremia to act as amplifying hosts or facilitate transmission. Enzootic foci for arboviruses are generally swampy areas, drainages, or irrigated agricultural land, with infection occurring primarily during the summer months. Both risk factors are relevant for roosting aggregations of Brazilian free-tailed bats, particularly colonies that roost over standing water (bridges) or near irrigated agricultural lands (both caves and bridges). Infection with flaviviruses or alphaviruses should induce a viral neutralizing antibody response that confers lifelong immunity against the specific virus responsible for infection. In the context of our data, we would predict that bats which are unable to mount strong T cell mediated antibody responses would be more likely to succumb to viral infection.
