To define a change in treatment, we first distinguished between patients who were treated before testing and those who were not. Because it was not possible to determine precisely when the treating physician became aware of the test result and on the basis of a turnaround time of <24 hours, we made 2 assumptions. First, antimicrobials prescribed on or before the date of test collection (day 0) were started before testing. Among these, change was measured in terms of discontinuation of treatment with the antimicrobial on day 1 or 2 after testing (eg, discontinuation of antibiotics if the RVP detected a virus). Second, among patients who were not treated before testing, change was measured in terms of commencing antimicrobial treatment on day 1 or 2 after testing (eg, commencing antiviral if the RVP detected influenza virus). We hypothesized that a positive test result for influenza virus would be associated with the continuation or commencement of antiviral treatment and that a detection of any virus by RVP would result in a greater likelihood of discontinuation of antibiotics, particularly in patients for whom there was no radiographic suspicion of pneumonia.",

Over 3 consecutive winters, influenza virus was detected in 53% of study patients; this frequency was significantly higher than the overall rate of influenza virus detection in the community. Based on results from our laboratory, influenza virus was detected in 9%\u201316% and other respiratory viruses in 21%\u201339% of all nasopharyngeal specimens (including those from children and ambulatory patients) during the study period, suggesting that influenza virus was a major cause of admission for respiratory tract infections among adults in our institution. One study from a setting similar to ours, in Quebec, Canada, reported higher relative contributions of viruses other than influenza virus among their patients, but these contributions were variable from year to year, accounting for 25% of infections one year and only 16% the next [18]. In our study, nearly half of other virus\u2013positive patients had radiographic suspicion of lower respiratory tract infections, and the majority required supplemental oxygen therapy, suggesting that these viruses were likely implicated in lower respiratory tract infections or COPD/asthma exacerbations. However, positivity for viruses other than influenza virus did not appear to be an important determinant of significant clinical outcomes, such as duration of hospitalization.",

Our data confirm that clinicians use rapidly available results of influenza virus testing to guide appropriate appropriate antiviral therapy. If the RVP detected influenza virus, physicians were 10 times as likely to continue oseltamivir that was started empirically or 9 times as likely to start oseltamivir de novo than if the RVP had negative results. However, among patients who did not start therapy before testing, fewer than half were prescribed oseltamivir after confirmation of influenza virus, presumably because physicians deemed the delay was too long for the patients\u2019 benefit. The association between RVP positivity and de-escalation of antibiotics was of smaller magnitude: patients started on antibiotics before testing and were subsequently found to test positive for influenza virus were roughly 1.4 times as likely to have their antibiotics discontinued as compared to those who tested negative, but the association was not statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders, such as age and comorbidity. The variable most significantly correlated with continuation of antibiotics started before testing was radiographic suspicion of pneumonia. Despite the well-established fact that chest radiography findings do not reliably differentiate between bacterial and viral lower respiratory tract infections, nor even between infectious and noninfectious illnesses, clinicians appear to be influenced more by radiographic findings than by viral test results when making antibiotic management decisions, probably because of concerns about bacterial coinfection. This was not only true for patients who started empirical therapy and presumably had more-severe illness at presentation\u2014patients who were not treated before testing and were subsequently found to have a positive RVP result were just as likely as those testing negative for all viruses to start antibiotics within the first 2 days.",

Some have proposed the use of procalcitonin-guided algorithms to predict bacterial infection [25\u201327], but this approach has yet to gain wide acceptance. A recent randomized controlled trial evaluating an algorithm combining procalcitonin measurement with viral testing noted a trend toward decreased duration of antibiotics in the subgroup with the lowest risk for bacterial infection, suggesting that physicians can respond to a combination of viral and biomarker data. However, that study excluded patients with radiographic suspicion of pneumonia, making it difficult to extrapolate the conclusions to other populations [28].",

While the ability to detect a wide range of viruses might be critical for immunocompromised patients, testing only for viruses commonly linked to lower respiratory tract infections (ie, influenza virus, RSV, and possibly adenovirus and metapneumovirus) might be more cost-effective and sufficient for the purposes of antimicrobial stewardship. Viruses typically associated with upper tract infections (eg, rhinovirus/enterovirus and parainfluenza virus) are indeed common in children and in ambulatory adults, and their detection is potentially useful for determining a viral etiology for asthma/COPD exacerbations.

First, we used a prospective but nonrandomized design, as this was our only option for comparing the impact of a change in management following availability of test results to a situation where no test was available. Such designs have been shown to be valid for diagnostic test evaluation; we used carefully defined selection criteria and adjusted for confounding variables to limit biases. Second, we restricted our analysis to antimicrobial use in the first 2 days after testing, because our objective was to assess immediate changes attributable to test result. It is possible that antimicrobial use over the course of hospitalization would have been lower among patients with positive RVP findings, but it is equally or more likely that antibiotics would have been given for additional indications, such as nosocomial infections. Third, we did not analyze microbiologic data, so it is possible that some of the cases were being treated for confirmed bacterial infection. However, results of microbiological testing (ie, cultures of blood and sputum specimens) are generally not finalized before several days, so it is unlikely that these factored much into the clinicians\u2019 early antimicrobial management decisions. Finally, the sample size of other virus\u2013positive patients in our population was relatively small, making it difficult to draw definite conclusions about specific patient outcomes for each virus. Although we prospectively tried to identify all patients tested with the RVP, patients with influenza may have been more likely to be included. Even if such a selection bias occurred, the effect of influenza virus positivity on antibiotic management was small, making it unlikely that such a bias impacted our conclusions significantly.",
