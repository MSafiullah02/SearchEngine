We aimed to identify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCP transporter function. Methods: We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for their anti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed. Results: We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with a sub-micromolar IC 50 . Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets.

The resulting CsA/CyP complex subsequently binds CN to inhibit its phosphatase activity, which in turn inactivates NF-AT, an essential transcription factor for immune responses. In addition to this primary activity of CyPs-and CN inhibition, CsA is also reported to inhibit the transporter activity of membrane transporter families [13] . Thus far, CsA has been reported to inhibit the replication of numerous viruses, including HIV, HCV, HBV, herpesviruses, dengue virus, West Nile virus, human papillomavirus, and coronaviruses [14, 15] .

We then investigated whether the four CsA derivatives inhibit the sodium-dependent bile acid uptake. NTCP transporter activity was evaluated with HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells (Fig. 5A ) and primary human hepatocytes (Fig. 5B) in the presence or absence of an excess amount of CsA or its derivatives (10 lM) using [ 3 H]-labeled taurocholic acid (TCA) as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 5A , a preS1 peptide and CsA decreased the sodiumdependent TCA uptake, which indicated NTCP transporter inhibitory activity, in HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells, as reported previously [41, 42, 45] (Fig. 5A, dark blue bars) . Among CsA derivatives, SCY446 showed an apparent reduction of the TCA uptake, while SCY806, SCY450, and SCY995 did not significantly affect NTCP activity (Fig. 5A, dark blue bars) . In primary human hepatocytes, SCY806, in addition to SCY446, within the SCY series significantly reduced the bile acid uptake (Fig. 5B) . The dose-response curves for inhibition of NTCP transporter activity indicate that SCY446 dramatically impaired the bile acid uptake as the case with CsA, while SCY995 did not show significant effect on the transport ( Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Although there is still possibility that SCY995 can inhibit NTCP transporter at higher concentrations, it was clearly shown that the activity of SCY995 to NTCP transporter, if any, was much lower than CsA or SCY446 (IC 50 : 1.49, 1.92, and >25 lM for CsA, SCY446, and SCY995, respectively). The above results reveal two types of anti-HBV entry inhibitors: those impairing bile acid uptake and those minimally affecting transporter function. This effect was not likely to be due to the enhancement of NTCP endocytosis, as these CsA derivatives did not apparently change the cell surface localization of NTCP ( Supplementary Fig. 6C-F) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 457, "end": 461, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 462, "end": 465, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1021, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1025, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1029, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 635, "end": 643, "text": "(Fig. 5A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 676, "end": 685, "text": "(Fig. 5B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 839, "end": 846, "text": "Fig. 5A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1055, "text": "(Fig. 5A, dark blue bars)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1237, "text": "(Fig. 5A, dark blue bars)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1375, "text": "(Fig. 5B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1629, "text": "Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2266, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 6C-F)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Effects of CsA derivatives on NTCP transporter activity"}, {"text": "Our data suggest that certain compounds can inhibit HBV entry without significantly affecting the transporter function of NTCP.

To further confirm whether the function for bile acid transport and the capacity to support HBV entry can be distinguishable, we searched for compounds that bind NTCP and inhibit its function as a bile acid transporter but cannot inhibit HBV infection. Sulfobromophthalein is known to function as a substrate of NTCP that interacts with the bile acid pocket of NTCP [46] . As shown in Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. 7 , sulfobro- mophthalein impaired the bile acid uptake in sodium-containing but not sodium-free condition in HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells, and it did not affect bile acid uptake of NTCP-deficient HepG2 cells. This suggests that sulfobromophthalein inhibited the NTCP-mediated bile acid transport, as reported previously [47] (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. 7) . However, this compound did not inhibit HBV infection under the same concentration conditions (Fig. 6B) . Furthermore, depletion of sodium inactivated the bile acid transport mediated by NTCP (Fig. 6C) , but the activity to support HBV infection was still present (Fig. 6D) , as reported previously [45] .

Any substitution of amino acid residues related to the transporter function, including sodium binding (Q68, S105, N106, E257, and Q261), or bile acid binding (N262, Q293, and L294), were found to reduce or completely abolish the capacity of NTCP to bind preS1 and support HBV entry [45] . These results suggested that the residues essential for the transporter function are also utilized by HBV for entry into host cells. In addition, previously reported inhibitors of NTCP transport activity were found to reduce the capacity of NTCP to support HBV infection. Until now, there is no report clearly demonstrating that the two functionalities of NTCP can be distinguished. The possible mode of mechanism for cyclosporins-NTCP interaction is discussed in the Supplementary note of the Supplementary materials. In the present study, we identified CsA derivatives (SCY450 and SCY995) that can inhibit HBV entry without affecting the NTCP transport activity, with equivalent, or even higher, anti-entry activity than the parental CsA. Thus, by minimizing the side-effect on NTCP function in bile acid transport, it is possible to develop compounds with acceptable side-effect profiles. Strong support for the concept of separating the antiviral activity of a compound from its inhibitory effects on the original function of the receptor is found among antiviral drugs against HIV. Maraviroc and TAK-220 both target an HIV coreceptor CCR5 and inhibit HIV entry with comparable potencies. While Maraviroc also inhibits the binding of CCR5 to its cognate ligands (RANTES, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b) [50] , TAK-220 does not affect binding of CCR5 to MIP-1b [51] . CsA is also reported to have a potential but weak to inhibit the activity of apical sodiumdependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), also known as NTCP2, another family transporter working for bile acid uptake [52] . Con- sistently, SCY450 and SCY995, as well as CsA, did not show significant reductions in ABST transporter by 10 lM ( Supplementary   Fig. 8 ), excluding the possibilities that these two derivatives are more potent ASBT inhibitors than CsA. As immunosuppression induced by compounds is likely to facilitate viral infection/replication in vivo [40] , it is desirable that the immunosuppressive activity of CsA be removed. This was achieved during the development of alisporivir, SCY-635, and NIM811, as non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors as anti-HCV drugs [34, 35, 53] . Most of the CsA derivatives examined in this present study were deficient in calcineurin inhibition, which is essential for the immunosuppressive activity, but still exerted anti-HBV activity. Interestingly, some of these compounds were also found to have weak inhibition on cyclophilins, including SCY446 and SCY450.
