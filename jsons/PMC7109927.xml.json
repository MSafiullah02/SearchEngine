In viral hepatitis, the interaction between immune response and virus-infected hepatocytes represents a key event for the initial control of viral replication, the protection and the development of the disease (4, 5). Several data indicate that control and clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV infections may be provided by the direct non-cytolytic antiviral activity of soluble factors (6, 7). Among the different kinds of cells involved in the early immunity, \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are known to exert a broad antiviral activity against different viruses such as retrovirus, flavivirus, paramyxovirus, orthomyxovirus, picornavirus, coronavirus, arenavirus, herpesvirus, hepadnavirus and orthopox virus (8).",

Differently, a decrease of the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell subset was observed in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic hepatitis C when compared with those of either controls or responders to IFN-\u03b1 therapy (10), suggesting a V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell-specific involvement in the antiviral immune response. Interestingly, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells can be activated by several non-peptidic antigens such as pyrophosphomonoesters (11\u201314), alkylamines (15) and N-containing bisphosphonates (16, 17).

In order to specifically activate V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, we used IPP, a non-peptidic compound known to selectively trigger this population (12, 13). After 4 days of co-culture, total RNA was extracted and the levels of HCV RNA were determined by RT\u2013PCR analysis. Notably, as shown in Fig. 1(A), IPP stimulation of co-cultures induced a dramatic reduction of HCV RNA levels in Rep60 cells (lane 5 and lane 7 for donors 0502 and 2902, respectively) independently of cell\u2013cell contact, while IPP does not affect per se HCV replication (lane 2). On the other hand, no effects on HCV RNA levels were observed with unstimulated PBMCs (lane 4 and lane 6 for donors 0502 and 2902, respectively), indicating that IPP activation is necessary to induce the inhibition of HCV replication and suggesting, therefore, the direct involvement of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. IFN-\u03b1, known to inhibit subgenomic HCV replication (26), was used as control (lane 3). Similar results were obtained using PBMCs isolated from other 15 healthy donors (data not shown). Notably, flow cytometric analysis of PBMCs confirmed that IPP stimulation induces the expression of different activation markers (CD25, CD69 and HLA-DR) exclusively on the V\u03b42 T lymphocyte surface from all donors analyzed (data not shown).\n",

While unstimulated PBMCs produced none of the cytokines detectable by the CBA system (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), the antigen stimulation induced a drastic increase of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production (IL-10: 284.5 \u00b1 81.7 pg ml\u22121; TNF-\u03b1: 1803.9 \u00b1 485.3 pg ml\u22121 and IFN-\u03b3: 1227.1 \u00b1 567.8 pg ml\u22121). These cytokines were mainly released by V\u03b42 T cells. In fact, intracellular staining assays of PBMCs cultured for 6 h in the presence of IPP showed that this stimulation induced a high frequency of TNF-\u03b1- and IFN-\u03b3-producing V\u03b42+ cells (Fig. 2B and C; 28.5 and 30% of the total V\u03b42+ cells, respectively). In contrast, bystander production of these cytokines by other cells was not significant (0.6 and 0.2%, respectively), confirming that IPP selectively activates V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells.\n",

For this experiment we used cell-free supernatants. These supernatants, obtained from V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells stimulated with IPP for different periods of time, were able to inhibit HCV replication in Rep60 cells at a similar extent of co-cultures (Fig. 3, lane 2, and data not shown), thus confirming that the IPP-stimulated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells produce cytokines which exert antiviral activity. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the block of IFN-\u03b3 activity by specific neutralizing antibodies (28) significantly reduced the HCV replication inhibition (Fig. 3, lane 6). On the contrary, no impairment of the HCV-inhibitory activity was observed using neutralizing antibodies against either TNF-\u03b1 (data not shown) or IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 3, lane 4). As control for the neutralizing activity of mAbs used in our experiments, Rep60 cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3, two known inhibitors of HCV replication (25, 26), either in the presence or absence of the specific neutralizing mAbs (Fig. 3, lanes 8\u201313 and lanes 14\u201319, respectively). As expected, both anti-IFN-\u03b1 and anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAbs were able to block HCV replicon clearance even at high doses of cytokines (Fig. 3, lane 13 and lane 19, respectively). It is worthy to note that high concentrations of recombinant TNF-\u03b1 were not able to influence HCV RNA levels (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that antiviral activity of IPP-activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells is mainly mediated through IFN-\u03b3 production.\n",

We asked, therefore, whether these drugs are able to induce V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell-mediated HCV clearance.

            "text": "In HCV patients, both specific and innate immunities are frequently unable to eradicate the infection. Moreover, the current regimens based on IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin are not effective in a considerable number of HCV patients. Therefore, the development of additional therapeutical approaches is needed. In this study, taking advantage of the subgenomic HCV replicon system in hepatoma cells (21, 22), we analyzed the anti-HCV activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. The major contribution of this work is the finding that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T lymphocytes exert an antiviral activity against HCV when activated by non-peptidic antigens. We found that IPP stimulation of either PBMCs or highly purified \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes induced a drastic inhibition of HCV replication. This antiviral activity was mediated by the release of non-cytolytic antiviral factors since it was independent of cell\u2013cell contacts and obtained using the supernatants of IPP-stimulated cultures. By the use of neutralizing antibodies we have demonstrated that, in our cell-culture system, the inhibition of HCV replication is exerted through the release of IFN-\u03b3. This result is in line with the ability of recombinant IFN-\u03b3 to inhibit HCV replicon replication (25). We identified the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T population as the effector cells of the IPP-mediated antiviral activity. Although, we cannot completely rule out a possible effect of other contaminating effector cells, intracellular staining experiments demonstrated that the main IFN-\u03b3-producing cells are V\u03b42 T lymphocytes. Moreover, the ability of highly purified \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes to inhibit HCV replication strongly suggested that this cell population is likely to be the main mediator of the antiviral activity. It has been shown that HCV-specific CD8 T cells are able to inhibit HCV replication by both direct cytolytic effects and cytokine-mediated activity (7). Our findings extend to the cells of innate immunity the capability to induce an activity against HCV. Evidences that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells mediate antiviral activity through the release of non-cytolytic soluble factors have been already reported. In human immunodeficiency virus infection, several data indicate that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells exert both cytolytic (29, 30) and non-cytolytic antiviral activity through the release of \u03b2-chemokines [macrophage inflammatory protein 1 \u03b1/\u03b2 (MIP1\u03b1/\u03b2) and regulation on activation normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES)] (31\u201333). Considering another flavivirus such as West Nile virus, the adoptive transfer of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to TCR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mice reduced the susceptibility of these mice to the virus (34). As for our in vitro co-culture system, this protective effect in vivo was primarily due to IFN-\u03b3 production.",

In HCV infections, the ability of T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 in the acute phase has been associated to viral clearance in humans (37). In chronic HCV-infected patients, an impairment of peripheral-specific T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 and hepatic expansion of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells with regulatory phenotype have been reported (38). Moreover, in chimpanzees the expansion of a Th1-oriented, multi-specific and sustained T cell response was associated with the resolution of HCV infection (39). These data indicate that the establishment of chronic infection may be associated to a status of low inflammation level. This could lead to an inhibition of Th1-specific immune response and to an expansion of IL-10-producing T cells, thus suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 production could be one of the key events for the resolution of HCV infection.",

Our data suggest that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, in spite of their apparent lack of specificity in virus recognition, could play an important role in the immune response against viruses by releasing IFN-\u03b3 and, likely, other non-cytolytic soluble factors. An interesting feature of the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell biology is the possibility to induce their activation by non-peptidic antigens. V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells were shown to release Th1 cytokines and to mediate a cytoreductive effect on myeloma cells when activated by N-containing bisphosphonates (16). Moreover, Phosphostim-activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells kill autologous metastatic renal carcinoma (20).
