As of April 15, 2020, it involved 2,035,299 cases globally, of whom 130,712 died.1,2 Coronaviruses comprise a range of positive-sense RNA viruses including several zoonotic viruses. Severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become serious and devastating threat worldwide; it spreads quickly among humans via 2 major routes: respiratory and fecal\u2013oral. Contaminated droplets are the major source of the virus transmission, and the disease initially occurs in the respiratory tract.3 Human-to-human transmission by direct contact at <1 m is the most effective way to transfer an infective amount of the virus, and this type of contact occurs frequently in medical centers during routine practice. In addition, the stability of the virus on solid surfaces is high, which puts the medical center setting at high risk for viral contamination.4 Thus, medical centers are critical areas for disease control. Unrecognized COVID-19 cases referred for routine endoscopic practice are a probable source of viral contamination of facilities. Endoscopic procedures can facilitate airborne transmission as well as contamination of surfaces. Medical personnel are at risk for disease dissemination by various routes.5 Iran, a Middle Eastern country, has a high rate of COVID-19. In Iran, 76,389 confirmed cases and 4,777 deaths have been reported, and Iran ranks first among Middle Eastern countries and eighth in the world for COVID-19 prevalence.1,2 Here, we report the COVID-19 prevalence in Iranian endoscopic wards among gastroenterologists.",

We distributed a questionnaire to all gastrointestinal wards in Iran, and we received responses from ~480 gastroenterologists by March 26, 2020. Our data analysis revealed that 51 of these gastroenterologists (10.6%) had COVID-19 symptoms that had been confirmed by a laboratory test. Among these cases, 60% had moderate disease, 30% had mild disease, and 10% had severe disease. Furthermore, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may represent a source of underdiagnosed COVID-19 cases because they do not present with classic symptoms of the disease such as fever and respiratory signs.6,7\n",
