On the other hand, identification process of COVID-19 cases should always follow proper management and humanitarian principles, adopting the entire set of universal precautions and recommendations described. The respecting of safety precautions can minimize risks, and it is unethical to refuse to perform a dental autopsy where requested by the medical examiner, except when there is non-availability of PPE or the odontologist himself is at high risk due to health issues. The identification process relies not only on dental post mortem data but also on DNA collections, which has been collected by the forensic pathologist. These two primary identifiers, DNA and dental, should both be considered when performing an identification autopsy, but when a dental autopsy is too risky and/or too labor intensive, DNA can be considered a stronger substitute for the identification [20] .",
