Experts can skip over this completely. Readers interested in the predictions should jump right away to section 5. Section 3 describes the Johns Hopkins data source with its limitations and flaws, and then presents a variation of a SIR model that can be applied directly to the data. It allows to estimate basic parameters, including the Basic Reproduction Number, but does not work for predictions of peaks of epidemics.",

This needs two extra parameters that should be extracted from the literature. The first is the infection fatality rate, as provided e.g. by [11, 10] , combined with the case fatality rate that can be deduced from the Johns Hopkins 3 pointing out certain abuses of these notions. This will not work without calculus, but things were kept as simple as possible. Readers should take the opportunity to brush up their calculus knowledge. Experts should go over to section 3.",

This follows from series of experiments that we do not document fully here, In [9] , data for 2k days backwards were used for the estimation, and results did not change much when more or less data were used or when k was modified. Here, the range 7 \u2264 k \u2264 21 was tested, and backlogs of up to 50 days from day 109 (as of this writing). See Figure 8 below for an example. Larger k lead to somewhat larger fatality rates, because the method has more leeway to assign deaths to confirmations, but the increase is rather small when k is increased beyond 14. It is remarkable that k = 7 suffices for a rather good fit for US, UK, Sweden, and Italy. In contrast to other countries, this means that 7 days after confirmation are enough to assign deaths consistently to previous confirmations, indicating that a large portion of confirmations concern rather serious cases. In general, the fit gets better when the backlog is not too large, avoiding use of outdated data, and the resulting rate does not change much when backlogs are shortened. Roughly, the rule of a backlog of 2k days works well, together with k = 21 to allow enough leeway to ensure a small fitting error.
