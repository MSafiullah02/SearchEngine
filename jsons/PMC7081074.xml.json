They are enveloped viruses that form spherical structures between 50 and 200 nm in diameter, with spiked bulbous projections of their S membrane glycoprotein mediating fusion with target cell membranes. They have a capped and polyadenylated positive-sense genome that serves as a template for the synthesis of either a full-length antigenome or a nested set of shorter negative-stranded RNA copies. These, in turn, generate new full-length positive-sense genomic molecules or a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs for expression of the viral proteins (Lai et al., 2007), respectively.",

            "text": "Currently, four genera of coronaviruses have been defined, alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The genus Gammacoronavirus is mostly composed of viruses isolated from birds: Galliformes (chicken, turkey, quail, guinea fowl, pheasant, peafowl), Anseriformes (duck, goose teal, swan, pintail), Columbiformes (pigeon), Pelecaniformes (spoonbill, heron), Suliformes (cormorant), Charadriiformes (red knot, oystercatcher, black-headed gull) and Passeriformes (bulbul); however, recently, gammacoronaviruses have also been identified in the beluga whale and bottlenose dolphins (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Woo et al., 2014). The most economically important of the avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs) are infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronaviruses (TCoVs). IBVs, which were the first coronaviruses to be isolated back in the 1930s, cause highly contagious infectious bronchitis in domestic fowl, a respiratory, renal and genital disease with serious economic consequences worldwide (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008). TCoVs, initially linked in the 1970s with an enteric disease known as transmissible enteritis, coronaviral enteritis of turkeys or bluecomb (Guy, 2008), have more recently been associated with a syndrome that includes several intestinal disorders occurring in turkeys before 7 weeks of age and usually within the first 3 weeks of life (Barnes et al., 2000), known as poult enteritis complex (PEC). The emergence of coronaviruses in turkeys in the USA was proposed to have resulted from recombination events involving IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified coronavirus donating a spike (S) gene that encoded a protein of low amino acid identity to those of IBV (35 %). This is suspected to have resulted in a host shift from chickens to turkeys and also in an altered tissue tropism of the virus from upper respiratory to intestinal. Recombination has been proposed in preference to evolution or selection of a subpopulation of viruses owing to this low S protein amino acid identity and because under experimental conditions exposure/passage of TCoVs in chickens did not result in selection for genetic changes that were sufficient to maintain infection and replication in chickens (Jackwood et al., 2010). It has also been shown, using patterns of synonymous substitutions to determine the index of mutation rates in protein-coding genes, that mutation rates in the S genes of IBV and TCoVs are very similar to those in their other genes (Hughes, 2011).",

Later, coronaviruses were also implicated with the disease in the USA in the 1990s, the UK in 2001, Italy in 2002, and then Brazil in 2007. A study performed in France on samples collected between 2007 and 2009 in 52 flocks with signs of PEC showed coronaviruses to be present in 37 % of these flocks; however, no TCoV was detected in 23 intestinal samples collected in French turkey flocks with enteritis before 1988 (Maurel et al., 2010).",

These conclusions were drawn according to the nucleotide and putative amino composition of its full-length S ORF; 98 % identity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels was observed between the detected genomes of three French strains, whereas these figures were at most 65 and 60 % with US TCoVs, and at most 50 and 37 % with IBVs. Even lower aa identities were seen in the S1 subdomain between the Fr TCoVs and the US TCoVs (42 %), and between Fr TCoVs and IBV (18 %). Further analysis using partial nucleotide sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORFs suggested that similar recombination events played a role in the evolution of the US and Fr TCoVs (Maurel et al., 2011), yet involving IBVs originating from their respective continents.",

In the second tree (Fig. 2b), generated using nt 8659 to 20 280 (region between the first and second predicted recombinant sites), Fr TCoV was again coupled with GfCoV/Fr/2011 and again placed in close proximity to Italy 2005, although the bv (69 %) was below the threshold limit, set at 75 %. US TCoVs were grouped with IBVs of US origin (bv 85 %), with the exception of IBV Delaware 072. A unique trend was observed in the third tree (Fig. 2c), nt 20 281 to 24 058 (region between the second and third predicted recombinant sites, mostly corresponding to the S gene), where Fr TCoV, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US TCoVs were grouped together (bv 100 %) and separated from all IBVs. These three types of viruses then formed three branches, each supported by a bv of 100 %. In the fourth tree (Fig. 2d), nt 24 059 to 27 739 (3\u2032 part of the genome, downstream of the third predicted recombination site), Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 were again coupled together (bv 86 %), placed in a group containing European IBV, Italy 2005 (bv 82 %) and separated from the US TCoVs. US TCoVs were again grouped with IBVs of US origin (bv 100 %). In agreement with Fig. 2(c), plotting the single nucleotide polymorphisms between Fr TCoV, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US TCoV or their closest IBV relative (Italy 2005) clearly showed that most genetic relatedness between Fr TCoV, GfCoV and US TCoV was linked to the S gene (Fig. S1, available in the online Supplementary Material).",

It has been suggested that ORFs E and 6b use TRSs upstream of 3a and N respectively (Cao et al., 2008); however, in the present study, specific TRSs are proposed for each ORF in light of the recent study that showed biological function of a non-canonical TRS in which only the last three bases (CAA) are required (Bentley et al., 2013).

This same pattern was observed in the trees in Fig. 2(b, d), which correspond to nt 8659 to 20 280 and 24 059 to 2 7739, respectively. The same trend, however, was not observed in the tree in Fig. 2(c) (nt 20 281 to 24 058). This region of sequence (mostly the S gene) resulted in one group containing Fr TCoV, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US TCoVs that was separated from the IBV viruses. This TCoV/GfCoV/Fr/2011 cluster was further separated into Fr TCoV, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US TCoVs. A calculation of nucleotide identities for this region between the three groups revealed a much closer relationship between GfCoV/Fr/2011 and US CoVs (80\u201381 %) than between GfCoV/Fr/2011 and Fr TCoV (64 %) or Fr TCoV and the US TCoVs (64\u201365 %). The Bootscan results mostly corroborated these relationships; however, they further identified a small zone of sequence (8747\u20139971) that grouped both Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 with an American TCoV, TCoV (TX-GL). This zone of sequence was not identified when using the 69 full-length sequences for prediction of recombination events; however, it did fall close to breakpoint 8658. As the two zones of sequence either side of this position grouped the same viruses, the first potential recombination breakpoint in terms of evolutionary hypothesis was considered to be position 20 281.",

Independently from these events, the same European recipient IBV (or GfCoV/Fr/2011 itself) was involved in another recombination event with AvCoV donor 1, which supplied the Fr TCoV-like S gene, thus resulting in Fr TCoV [Fig. 5a (iii) upper panel]. A recombination event is proposed here rather than the evolution of GfCoV/Fr/2011 into Fr TCoV owing to the substantial number of nucleotide modifications required for GfCoV/Fr/2011 S to become Fr TCoV S. Also, as mutation rates in the S genes of IBV and TCoVs are very similar to those in their other genes (Hughes, 2011), then it would be expected that this number of changes would have imposed an accumulation of nucleotide modifications in the other areas of sequence, so that GfCoV and Fr CoV would not have been so closely related in the trees derived from other genes. Because of the similarities of the S genes of Fr TCoV, US TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011, it can be inferred that \u2018AvCoV donor 2\u2032 and \u2018AvCoV donor 1\u2019 should in this model share a common ancestor [\u2018AvCoV donor ancestor\u2019 in Fig. 5a (i) upper panel].

The domestication and complex worldwide diffusion of domestic guinea fowl, turkey and chickens may have provided ample opportunities over centuries for such inter-specific contacts. Chicken and guinea fowl breeding was already documented in ancient Greece, and guinea fowl meat featured in Roman banquets in the first century AD (Scherf, 2000). Although guinea fowl breeding was subsequently abandoned in Europe, this species was reintroduced when the Portuguese returned from Africa in the late 15th century (Belshaw, 1985). Both chicken and guinea fowl were transferred to the New World shortly after its Discovery: animal breeding farms established by 1495 in Cuba and Santo Domingo included chickens, which supposedly were shipped soon after to Mexico and South America (Scherf, 2000). The first shipments of guinea fowl to the Caribbean are documented slightly later, in 1508 (Lamblard, 1975). Such introductions of European poultry could have brought chicken and guinea fowl into contact with domestic turkeys, which apparently underwent a complex domestication history (Speller et al., 2010; Kennedy Thornton et al., 2012) and were reportedly widespread in Mesoamerica at the time of the Discovery and in the Caribbean soon after (Crawford, 1985). Reciprocally, the first shipment of domestic turkeys to Europe was documented in 1500 and turkey breeding, first encouraged in Spain in 1511, quickly expanded from southern to northern European countries in the first half of the 16th century (Crawford, 1985). Clearly, these movements must have led to the repeated introduction of naive birds into new ecosystems in both the New and Old Worlds, such epidemiological situations being favourable for inter-species transmission events. Similar situations most likely reoccurred over the centuries, as poultry (turkey) breeds developed in Europe were further re-exported to the Americas.",

For each partial genome region, all dated sequences that were neither of clone nor of vaccine origin and did not expose any evidence of recombination were selected (typically 40 sequences per region). For the S gene, all available full-length sequences of TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 that were dated were used, corresponding to seven American TCoV, four French TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011. With BEAUti software, the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock with the GTR+G + I model of nucleotide substitution was applied with constant size demographic models. The trace files were visualized with Tracer 1.6, especially to verify that the effective sample size value was greater than 200, which corresponds to the minimum acceptable number of independent samples. Maximum clade credibility trees were generated after removing a 10 % burn-in with TreeAnnotator v1.7.5. The trees obtained were also visualized and annotated by FigTree v1.4 software. For each part of the genome studied, the age of the most recent common ancestor between Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011 was determined with a posterior probability above or equal to 0.90, and then dates for the different genome regions were compared. Uncertainty in the estimated results was reported as values of the 95 % HPD.",
