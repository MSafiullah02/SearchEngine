Buses, taxis, and vans, both public and private service, can be used to transport large numbers of patients. Public-sector transportation vehicles are typically rapidly and easily accessible to government authorities. Many government authorities contract with private conveyance systems for more routine transportation needs. There may be opportunity to expand those contractual services to include emergency availability for transport not only of patients but, potentially, personnel. Finally, use of mass transportation vehicles may offer shelter for victims during the initial phases of a disaster.",

Specialized needs for high-level respiratory and isolation units may be \u201ccreated\u201d by relatively low-cost engineering with the installation of ventilation deflectors that allow for negative air flow to those rooms individually or to a unit. In an incident, air flow and air exchanges can be adapted to provide flexible utilization of nonspecialty bed capacity. The authors of Regionalization of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response,6 through retrospective analysis, determined that \u201cpre-event hospital designation contributes to lower costs and improved patient outcomes. The evidence from trauma care regionalization suggests that a key component of high-quality, cost-effective care is limiting high-cost specialty care to specifically designated hospitals with increased experience in treating severely injured patients. A bioterrorism response system may benefit from the pre-event designation of hospitals.\u201d However, in the SARS events in Toronto, it was found that the transfer of patients to designated facilities may have contributed to further spread of the disease, especially early in the outbreak when control measures were still being clarified and made universal.15,\n16 Well documented in the literature and further described by Einav and colleagues17 in a study of terrorist-related MCI blast incidents, the most urgent and nonurgent victims are taken to the nearest hospital, even if it is not a designated trauma center. The authors suggest a paradigm shift in trauma care in which all hospitals should have some minimal level of capability for trauma care. In fact, the most recent model in Israel designates the nearest hospital as the evacuation hospital to which all trauma victims are taken. Only the most seriously wounded get surgical intervention while other less critical victims are sent to surrounding facilities after stabilization of life-threatening injuries, thereby making the facility serve as a triage center. In a mass-casualty event, referral and transfer to tertiary care facilities for advanced specialty care may be necessary and desired; however, in the disaster operation phase, these specialized services may no longer be available, either because the services have been diverted to general care or the specialty services are overwhelmed. Additionally, until or even after aggressive diversion of patients to triage centers is well established, patients may still self-refer to the hospital of their choosing for a number of reasons, including proximity, insurance coverage, and personal preference. It may be unpredictable as to which facilities will become a focus for care and likely that many, if not all, hospitals will become primary institutions. For this reason, every facility must be prepared to care for patients.",

It has been suggested that early deployment of local medical centers can alleviate the burden placed on local hospitals.18 Decontamination facilities may need to be established rapidly to prevent further contamination of the center. Patient care flow in the center directs patients first to a triage process and then to either a transportation section for transfer to a hospital or to a treatment area for definitive care. The duration of care is anticipated to be relatively brief (24 hours or shorter) and may consist simply of observation for further symptoms. Because most casualties in an acute, rapid-onset event (explosion, structure collapse, or chemical release) will be rapidly transported, the most significant weakness of the OST3C model is the need for rapid deployment and implementation. Therefore, the OST3C facility must be well planned, well integrated, and well rehearsed. This frequently limits its utilization; however, two additional potential roles for such a facility include short-term (12- to 24-hour) observation units and predeployment for large-scale events, such as mass gatherings. Physical requirements include access to controlled vehicular traffic for ambulance use, male and female lockers and shower facilities or an external water supply for outside decontamination, heating and air conditioning, electricity with generator back-up, etc. Potential buildings to be used for an OST3C are gymnasiums, fitness centers, hotels conference centers, and any other building with large space capacity.",

It is designed to treat patients who require acute care but not mechanical ventilation for a duration of days to weeks. Patients who require intensive life supportive care would be admitted to a traditional hospital. The ACC would be near a traditional hospital but transparent to the public who should self-refer or be referred to the center's emergency department for initial evaluation and subsequent triage.19 However, the ACC also could be integrated into diversion protocols to alleviate emergency departments from this triage function and optimize the ACC's utility. The ACC module is a 250-bed pod system (5 \u00d7 50-bed nursing units) that is expandable to a maximum of 1000 patients and requires 40,000 to 48,000 square feet.

The CERT program is an all-risk, all-hazards training in which citizens may initially take actions on their own, and these actions can make a difference. The CERT program was developed by the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) to engage citizen volunteer efforts to augment the response capacity before and during the department's response. In 1993, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) made the concept and program available to communities nationwide. The Emergency Management Institute (EMI), in cooperation with the LAFD, expanded the CERT materials to make them applicable to all hazards. In January 2002, CERT became part of the Citizen Corps, a unifying structure to link a variety of related volunteer activities to expand a community's resources for crime prevention and emergency response. As of December 2004, 50 states, three territories, and six foreign countries were using the CERT training for a total of 1900 CERT teams.20\n",

DMATs deploy to disaster sites with adequate supplies and equipment to support themselves for 72 hours and provide medical care at a fixed or temporary medical site. They may provide primary healthcare and/or augment overloaded local healthcare staff. DMATs are designed to be a response element to supplement local medical care until other federal or contract resources can be mobilized or the situation has resolved. Each DMAT deployable unit consists of approximately 35 individuals; however, teams may consist of more than three times this number to provide some redundancy for each job role. This ensures that an adequate number of personnel are available at the time of deployment. A team is composed of medical professionals and support staff who are organized, trained, and prepared to activate as a unit. Some states and regions are developing intrastate DMATs or Medical Reserve Corps. In a large-scale disaster, a DMAT's ability to provide local personnel surge capacity may be limited because these teams frequently draw on the same pool of professionals already expected to respond during the disaster.",

In fact, in a long-term event, such as a communicable disease event, supply shortages may become an increasing and broader issue. A disaster may quickly exhaust available supplies, including medications, or may prevent the further replenishment of supplies from outside of the affected area. It is important to conduct a needs assessment and have an ongoing materials management process to assess current and anticipated needs and acquisition and appropriation of supplies on hand. In many U.S. disasters, supply shortages have not occurred, but rather, excessive donations have created a different challenge (see Chapter 35). Unfortunately, the pre-event purchase and stockpile of equipment can be costly and difficult to justify in the current economic environment and as healthcare facilities continue to shift to \u201cjust in time\u201d inventories. Graded increases in par levels of supplies, regionally leveraged purchases, and rotation into stock can ease the financial burden of preparedness. Federal response systems anticipate this need and purchase, and strategic forward deployment has been under way at that level. However, depending on the nature of the incident, it is prudent to assume that facilities and agencies should plan on being self-sufficient for the first 48 to 72 hours after an event. This places an additional burden on planning for an event, such as an explosion or chemical event, which will require adequate resources within the first hours or sooner. In this case, outside resources should be used to provide subsequent care and to restock used supplies.",

The speed and mechanism of delivery may vary, depending on the incident. Natural disasters may impede surface transportation of surge supplies. During the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon, emergency response vehicles, police closing of roads, and the ordered evacuation of federal facilities created a transportation gridlock, limiting the delivery of anticipated supplies to some hospitals in the District of Columbia (MedStar Health System, personal communication, January 2004).",

Depending on the nature of the event, the type of PPE used will likely be the most protective until the causative agent is defined. Standards for such PPE are well defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In disasters with noncontaminated physical hazards, such as an earthquake with building collapse, PPE should consist of protection for the extremity, head, ears, and eyes. In the prehospital arena, for suspected chemical, contaminated explosive, or unknown contamination scenes, personnel functioning within a \u201chot zone\u201d are likely to be in Level A protection. Level A PPE offers the highest level of protection. It encompasses positive pressure breathing apparatus, SCBA, with a fully encapsulating chemical suit. After the removal of victims and subsequent decontamination, graded \u201cstep-down\u201d in protection can be made until a level appropriate for definitive protection is attained. For example, initial evaluation of patients with an unknown communicable disease may first be approached with the provider in full high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) respiratory and splash precautions. Once the infectious agent is identified and other potential preventative steps are taken (e.g., vaccination), PPE can be shifted to the appropriate mask and Universal Precautions. Amounts of PPE required to sustain a response is dependent on the durability and lifespan of the equipment (single-use versus multi-use), inter-user transfer of equipment (sharing), and the anticipated number of changes per provider. Durable hazardous materials gear may have longevity of several days into an event, may be able to pass from one worker to another, and is not necessarily disposable after each use. N95 respirators used for smallpox respiratory protection may be usable by a single user over a 12-hour shift but would not be shared and would be disposed of after the shift.
