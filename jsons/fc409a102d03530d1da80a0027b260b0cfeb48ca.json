One such association is its tendency to cause thromboembolic events, particularly venous thromboembolism 1, 2 . In a four-week period during the initial spread of COVID-19 at a 300 bed community hospital in western Massachusetts, 23 patients who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA required treatment in either the intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate/step-down unit (SDU). All patients were treated with standard DVT prophylaxis from the time of admission, except for two patients who were on full anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation. Of the 23 patients, 7 (30%) were diagnosed with acute, clinically significant, pulmonary embolism (PE). Four of the 7 manifested evidence of acute cor pulmonale, one of whom succumbed as a direct consequence of a massive PE. Other markers were reviewed in the 7 patients to identify trends that could allow for early suspicion of PE in COVID-19 patients. Although D-dimer tended to rise during the hospitalization relative to the control group, the results were inconsistent, and there were no other meaningful distinguishing features between the groups at the time of admission.",

Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common complaints, but the mean resting heart rate was noted to be modestly higher in the PE group (104 vs. 88). Both groups showed lymphopenia. Pro-BNP was higher in the PE group at the time of admission, but the comparison was limited by incomplete data for the two groups. D-dimer trended upward in the PE group compared to the control group during the hospitalization ( Figure 1 ). Other risk factors for PE, including BMI, recent surgeries, and travel history were similar across both groups.",

Of the seven patients who developed acute PE, the mean time to diagnosis was 9.4 days following hospitalization. The mean Wells score for the PE+ group was 5.7 and the PE-group 4.2, indicating a lack of discrimination with use of Wells criteria in these two groups. The diagnosis of acute PE was confirmed by CT pulmonary angiography in 6 patients and by transthoracic echocardiography in one patient, who suddenly became hypotensive on day five with severe right ventricular dysfunction and a positive McConnell sign. Despite treatment with thrombolytic therapy (100 mg intravenous tissue plasminogen activator) he expired three days later with multi-organ failure secondary to obstructive shock.",

The mechanism of hypercoagulability in these patients is not known, but the emergence of antiphospholipid antibodies and/or triggering of disseminated intravascular coagulation in critically ill patients have been suggested as possible mechanisms 3, 4 . The latter is also supported by autopsy reports, which have shown the presence of frank hemorrhage along with small thrombi in sections of the lung parenchyma 5 .",
