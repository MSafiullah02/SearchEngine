            "text": "In August 2016, Paramount Pictures released a series of 12 posters to promote the forthcoming sci-fi film Arrival, an adaptation of the novella The Story of Your Life (1998) by American writer Ted Chiang, which explores language, communication, and determinism. Each of the 12 posters featured a giant UFO-like object hovering over a specific place on Earth: Hokkaido, the Indian Ocean, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Kujalleq in Greenland, Venezuela, Siberia, Montana, Devon in the UK, Pakistan, the Russian coast of the Black Sea, and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong poster, which showed one of the UFOs looming above the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour skyline, needless to say, caught the attention of many Hongkongers. Their excitement at seeing Hong Kong featured on a Hollywood film poster was, however, dampened by the fact that the Hong Kong in the image was not quite the same as the one they knew intimately. There was a notable interloper: Shanghai\u2019s Oriental Pearl Tower, the tallest building in China between 1994 and 2007, was added to the Hong Kong cityscape. The incongruity of the tower was not lost on Hongkongers, even if it might not be as obvious to those less familiar with the city. While some argued that the mistake was simply an innocuous oversight on the part of some ignorant creatives, there were others more offended by the mix-up who considered it politically insensitive, especially given the strained relationship between many Hong Kong people and China. The intrusion of a Shanghai Tower in a recognizable Hong Kong cityscape could itself be seen as a compelling metaphor for \u201cmainland-ization\u201d of the city. One online commenter, for example, wrote, \u201cNo excuses! You guys really did make a big mistake. Hong Kong is always different from China. This is totally unacceptable for real Hong Kong people\u201d (qtd. in Lai, np). The strong reaction of many Hongkongers to this casual conflation of Hong Kong and Shanghai, justified or not (given that this was a poster for a science fiction film), speaks to a deep-rooted ambivalence in Hong Kong about, or even resentment at, being associated with China. The poster strongly suggested that the specificity of each of the two cities was disregarded. It is as if all Chinese cities are generically similar and interchangeable.",

            "text": "The indignation of many Hongkongers at the gaffe made the news, and the film\u2019s distributors, Paramount Pictures, decided to completely remove the Hong Kong poster from its Facebook page and advertisement campaign and replace it with one featuring Shanghai. In recent years, Hong Kong appears in the backdrop of a number of Hollywood blockbusters including The Dark Knight (2008), Pacific Rim (2013), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), and Doctor Strange (2016), to name a few, suggesting that the city is \u201crecognized\u201d internationally as an urban center of some importance, as well as being a highly photogenic location. And yet the Arrival incident suggests that Hong Kong\u2019s appearance in these films is perhaps at best superficial and at worst replaceable. The response to a PR mishap was not to fashion a new poster without Shanghai\u2019s Oriental Pearl Tower but rather to elide Hong Kong altogether and reinstate the Shanghai high-rise in its locale; the episode suggests a wider issue of effacement of Hong Kong, possibly sacrificed to appease marketing concerns. After all, angering Hongkongers is not near as commercially disastrous as alienating the vast potential market in the mainland. A paradox emerges: Hong Kong is both absent and present in the regional marketing campaign for the film. Absent in the final poster and present in the withdrawn image that, despite being shelved, has been reproduced many times and continues to exist\u2014an existence that is lingering and haunting. In this case Hong Kong is already a specter before its time is up, almost \u201ca supernatural and paradoxical phenomenality, the furtive and ungraspable visibility of the invisible\u201d (Derrida, 6). The incident also shows that Hongkongers feel strongly about how their city is represented and perceived. How the city is portrayed also prompts reflection on their senses of identity.",

            "text": "The Arrival poster and the reaction it provoked among Hongkongers raise two major significant issues in the interdisciplinary field of Hong Kong Studies. How is Hong Kong presented in Western cinema and how do these representations affect Hongkongers\u2019 sense of self, place, and identity. The representations of Hong Kong in Western film construt a matrix composed of a wholesale circulation of people, genres, and ideas, including the use of Hong Kong actors, the appropriation of Hong Kong film genres (e.g. kung fu and gangster films), and an intertextual deployment of the aesthetics, the look and atmosphere, that characterize Hong Kong films. The appearance of the city of Hong Kong in English-speaking films produced by foreign companies is arguably of particular significance. The past decade or so is rife with what I term \u201cthe paradox of appearance and disappearance of Hong Kong\u201d in Western cinema and the Western film industry in general in the past decade or so. The city\u2019s recent appearances in big-budget Hollywood productions attest to its continuing visual and \u201cexotic\u201d appeal to a Western or global audience that recalls the role pre-handover Hong Kong played in the conception and design of Ridley Scott\u2019s 1982 film Blade Runner, adapted from the Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968). However, the real Hong Kong is often displaced in these films and supplanted by a recycled and stereotyped impression or simulacrum of the city\u2019s skyline and urban landscape. Even in a film supposedly set in Hong Kong\u2014Ghost in the Shell (2017)\u2014the metropolis is distorted to such an extent that, while it can still be recognized as Hong Kong, its representation is alienating and disorienting. In the following pages, I aim to provide an overview of the portrayal of Hong Kong in Western films in recent years, including a discussion of Hollywood blockbusters set at least partly in Hong Kong. Note, for example, the double removal of Hong Kong in both W. Somerset Maugham\u2019s The Painted Veil (1934) and its most recent film adaptation (2006), the stigmatization of Hong Kong as the origin of a lethal virus in Contagion (2011), and the gamification of Hong Kong in Ghost in the Shell (2017).",

            "text": "In a recent article published on National Public Radio\u2019s website, Ilaria Maria Sala and Jeffrey Wasserstrom write about how Hong Kong\u2019s recent history might be considered as \u201ca series of struggles over appearance and disappearance\u201d (2017). Beginning with pro-democracy protesters ahead of the twentieth anniversary of the handover shrouding the Golden Bauhinia statue in black cloth1\u2014in other words, making the statue disappear\u2014Sala and Wasserstrom trace other instances of appearance and disappearance in the city. These include the abduction between October and December 2015 of five booksellers associated with the Mighty Current publishing house, the closing-off of commercial distribution avenues in Hong Kong to the award-winning dystopian film Ten Years (2015), and the \u201ccreeping appearance\u201d in the city of things chiefly linked to China (the increasing use of Mandarin and the higher profile assumed by personnel and material of the People\u2019s Liberation Army). There is also the defiantly persistent appearance of certain things in Hong Kong (the yearly vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, replicas of the Goddess of Democracy statue) and the appearance of the Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Bridge off Lantau Island that \u201chas helped cause a literal disappearance\u2014of the [region\u2019s] endangered pink dolphins.\u201d Sala and Wasserstrom\u2019s article describes and documents Hongkongers\u2019 concerns over these appearances and disappearances. The trepidation about disappearance and loss, however, perhaps outweighs that about the appearance of things previously absent in the city. The authors conclude their piece with this ominous comment: \u201c[T]he fear in Hong Kong now is that the things that have been lost will never be coming back.\u201d Things disappearing or vanishing (as explored in the documentary Vanished Archives, about the paucity of available official records on the 1967 riots), historic buildings demolished (such as Queen\u2019s Pier in 2007), the removal of the city\u2019s famous neon signs, Cantonese disappearing as a medium of instruction in certain schools, the past manipulated\u2014these contribute to the dissolution of the Hong Kong as city denizens have known it, making it a little less like the Hong Kong of our lived memory every day.",

            "text": "When talking about Hong Kong and the notion of disappearance, one cannot omit to mention Ackbar Abbas\u2019s Hong Kong: Culture and the Politics of Disappearance (1997), which partly informs this present essay. Writing during the countdown to Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China, Abbas suggested understanding Hong Kong culture through the lens of \u201ca culture of disappearance.\u201d He wrote, \u201cThe change in status of culture in Hong Kong can be described as follows: from reverse hallucination, which sees only desert, to a culture of disappearance, whose appearance is posited on the imminence of its disappearance\u201d (7). As we approach 2047, the year the promise of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d expires, it can be said that the idea of \u201cdisappearance\u201d has become once again highly prescient to the narration of Hong Kong, as the city will be absorbed\u2014\u201cdisappeared\u201d\u2014into China, more fully than ever, and the status of Hong Kong as a semiautonomous special administrative region will be no more. Sala and Wasserstrom, in their article, focus on individual cases of (dis)appearance in the city. Building on their observations, I argue that the city as a whole can be seen as struggling over its appearance and disappearance in the face of the world\u2019s gaze, demonstrated in its representation and reception in the Western film industry, while Abbas\u2019s earlier discussion of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cculture of disappearance\u201d is an important intertext.",

            "text": "The most representative and often-studied Western films set in Hong Kong before the handover are perhaps Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955), adapted from the autobiographical novel by Han Suyin published in 1952, and The World of Suzie Wong (1960), adapted from Richard Mason\u2019s 1957 novel of the same title. The two films share a similar plot and the same lead actor, William Holden. In each film, a white man comes to Hong Kong and falls in love with a local woman; through this encounter the themes of cultural differences and love are supposedly explored. The women in both films are exoticized, eroticized, rendered as \u201cfetishistic\u201d objects, and are \u201cavailable,\u201d while the city itself is feminized and othered. This analysis of the films is, admittedly, as familiar and predictable as their plots. An interracial love story is neither inherently admirable nor objectionable, but in these films, one finds straightforward expressions and demonstrations of Edward Said\u2019s discourse on Western imaginary constructions of the East, which is a projection of Western fantasies and desires. Thomas Y. T. Luk (2002) compares The World of Suzie Wong with Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness (1899), saying that Suzie Wong is \u201creminiscent\u201d of Joseph Conrad\u2019s native woman in Heart of Darkness and is \u201can embodiment of the spirit of wilderness, fecundity and mystery.\u201d He continues: \u201cSuzie, the Orient, is vitality just as [Robert] Lomax, the west, is lie and hypocrisy, a bipolar paradigm, again, analogous to Africa and Europe in Conrad\u201d (76).",

This is not in itself progress, though, as there is a general absence of Hongkongers playing meaningful and major speaking parts. The lived experiences and aspirations of people from the city are also never really the focus. True, there is less racism and sexism reified in the form of a submissive and attractive female co-lead, but the lack of representation of Hong Kong\u2019s cultural and social structure continues to be conspicuous in these filmic texts. This virtual effacement of agency of the city\u2019s natives reminds one of Chinua Achebe\u2019s famous criticism to Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness (1978), in which he says of the book\u2019s Africa setting that it \u201celiminates the African as human factor,\u201d thereby \u201creducing Africa to the role of props\u201d (9).

In Transformers: Age of Extinction, part of the Hong Kong scene is also filmed elsewhere: at a vacant lot in downtown Detroit which was turned into \u201ca replica of Hong Kong\u201d (Hinds, np). These recent examples of filming Hong Kong outside of Hong Kong are in fact a continuation of the tradition of studio productions in an earlier period. The 1952 film Hong Kong, which features later US President Ronald Reagan, for example, is filmed in a Paramount studio. There are also films that shoot \u201cHong Kong\u201d in other locations. Wong Kar-wai\u2019s In the Mood for Love (2000) was filmed mostly in Bangkok, as most mid-twentieth-century architecture in Hong Kong had been demolished\u2014\u201cvanished as the city continually rebuilds itself\u201d (Camhi, np).

In the above commentary, the writer is othering \u201cHong Kong\u201d and \u201cChina\u201d against \u201cthe world\u2019s community,\u201d although the process of othering already started in the very conception of the film depicting a tale of global circulation of virus inspired by Hong Kong\u2019s SARS. Contagion is set in a number of cities other than Hong Kong, including Abu Dhabi, Atlanta, Geneva, London, Macau, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Tokyo, but Hong Kong is set apart from these other cities for being the source of the deadly, contagious virus. We see Hong Kong again in the spotlight of the global gaze, this time not being admired but portrayed as a sinister locus, both in the film\u2019s plot and in the real world where the film is shown and reviewed, a treatment neither the city nor its citizens asked for.6 One reviewer refers to \u201cHong Kong\u2019s embarrassment over the SARS epidemic\u201d (Catsoulis, np), while another believes shooting the film in Hong Kong is \u201ca move that is likely to stir up painful memories\u201d (Landreth, np). In The New Yorker, David Denby remarks that the scariest part of the film is that Paltrow\u2019s character caught the disease not in a jungle but while visiting \u201cone of the most cosmopolitan places in the world\u201d (np). This slight disbelief only highlights the unfortunate role Hong Kong plays in the fictional epidemic. Hongkongers may not want the SARS episode to disappear from the city\u2019s recent history and their memory altogether, but they certainly do not need to be reminded of it on cinema screens watched by audiences the world over, much as international news focused on Hong Kong when SARS racked the city in 2003.",

            "text": "The recent live adaptation of the Japanese manga series Ghost in the Shell (2017), directed by Rupert Sanders, like the four Hollywood blockbusters discussed earlier, is set in an otherworlded Hong Kong. Although the film shares a number of similarities with the other four films, such as transforming familiar places in Hong Kong into battlegrounds with a seeming disregard of the city\u2019s lived history and its people\u2019s lived experience, Ghost in the Shell exhibits a higher level of immersion in Hong Kong\u2019s urban environment. The manga series by Masamune Shirow, first serialized in 1989 and set in Tokyo, has been adapted a number of times. In the first anime adaptation in 1995, directed by Mamoru Oshii and set in 2029, Hong Kong is the backdrop. Takeuchi Atsushi, the art designer for that production, had the following to say about Hong Kong: \u201cThere is a sharp contrast between old streets and new ones on which skyscrapers are built. [\u2026] It is a situation in which two entities are kept in a strange neighboring relationship. Perhaps it is what the future is\u201d (qtd. in Wong, 106). In Atsushi\u2019s interpretation, Hong Kong, due to its admixed architecture and street elements combining the new and the old, looks as though it belongs to the future\u2014a suitable location then for a tale set in a near-future world where cybernetic enhancement is prevalent. Also interesting in Atsushi\u2019s remark is the focus on \u201cold streets\u201d; there is a similar emphasis in the live-action adaption, in which Scarlett Johansson, who plays the main character Major Mira Killian, is pursued through the bustling streets of Yau Ma Tei (Hadfield, np).",

This gamification of Hong Kong in the film, including heavy layers of CGI (computer-generated imagery) and huge hologram advertisements, alienates the city from the film\u2019s Hong Kong audiences. Still, Hong Kong locations and buildings such as the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Des Voeux Road in Central, the public housing estates of Lai Tak Tsuen in Tai Hang and Montane Mansion in Quarry Bay, the Lippo Centre in Admiralty, North Port waterfront, Tsuen Wan Chinese Permanent Cemetery, Yau Ma Tei Market, and Yee Wo Street in Causeway Bay are still distinctively recognizable.

As Vivienne Chow (2017) points out, \u201cIf Major was fighting under the synthetic skin to recover her personal history, then Hong Kong too is facing the same struggle within the skin that Beijing wants to house us in.\u201d The immersive use of Hong Kong\u2019s cityscape in Ghost in the Shell inspires this engaging reading of its possible symbolism, but on the surface the film is still a science fiction having nothing to do with Hong Kong.",

Admittedly, he is talking about heritage and identity in the context of Hong Kong\u2019s protest movements. But this sense of \u201ccommunity\u201d can be created by going to the cinema. Cindy Hing-Yuk Wong and Gary W.

As far back as 1988, the critic Paul Fonoroff was already lamenting that it was \u201cfrustrating for anyone with a knowledge of Hong Kong\u2019s rich cinematic heritage to view the current scene\u201d (308). In this context, whether Hongkongers\u2019 \u201cheritage,\u201d this time to use Dapiran\u2019s definition, is honored or disregarded in the global gaze of Western films set in the city affects how Hongkongers position themselves\u2014positively or negatively\u2014in relation to the rest of the world. In Orientalism, Edward Said discusses the unfortunate impact on colonized subjects exposed to Western texts and how they systematically fail to see themselves mirrored in this literature. Today, being more aware of the harmful effect of non-representation on marginalized individuals, there are those in the entertainment industry who call for more racial diversity and the casting of more people of color and members of the LGBTQ community in films and TV. The narratives of Hong Kong, however, are buried in this global cinematic awakening, as its unique identity is dissolving at a rapid speed\u2014via the disappearance of iconic city features and its elisions/distortions/appropriations in Western films that exploit it as site and sight, and especially in the last decade in the face of the powerful forces of the Chinese market which monetarize and so dictates the tastes and subjects of Hong Kong films.",
