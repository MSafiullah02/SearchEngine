The major concern in this condition is person to person transmission when the patient considers as a cured person with negative nucleic acid test. On the other hand, negative oropharyngeal swab may not an indication for discharge and possible shift from more oropharyngeal positive results during the early period to more anal positive results during the later period should be considered in this patients. Furthermore, anal swab specimen will reduce health care providers' infections by COVID\u201019. Finally, protection from fecal shedding route should be considered as important medical advice for reducing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, notably in treated patients who met discharge criteria with negative oropharyngeal swab test. Further studies need to consider negative fecal viral RNA test as a criterion for patients discharge, undoubtedly, protect against fecal shedding is necessary during hospitalization and after patients discharge.",
