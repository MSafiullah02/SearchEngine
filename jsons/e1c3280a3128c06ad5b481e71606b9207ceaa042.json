Based on the recently resolved 6LU7 PDB structure, ligands were generated using a multimodal structure-based design and then optimally docked to the 6LU7 monomer. Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases, irrespectively of the protonation state of the catalytic CYS-HIS dyad. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement. Molecular dynamics calculations fully confirm the stability in the 3CL pro binding pocket of most potent binder identified by docking, namely a chlorophenyl-pyridyl-carboxamide derivative.",

While dimerization is believed to provide a substrate-binding cleft between the two monomers, 8 in the dimer the solvent-exposed CYS-HYS dyads are symmetrically located at the opposite edges the cleft, probably acting independently. 9 As no host-cell proteases are currently known with this specificity, early drug discovery was directed towards the so-called covalent Michael inhibitors, 10 via electrophilic attack to the cysteinate of the 3CL pro dyad. On the other hand, the consensus in drug discovery leads to excluding electrophiles from drug candidates for reasons primarily relating to safety and adverse effects such as allergies, tissue destruction, or carcinogenesis. 11",

            "text": "The most potent non-covalent inhibitor for 3CL pro , ML188, was actually reported nearly ten years ago 13 with moderate activity in the low micromolar range. 14 Development of SMC targeting 3CL pro can hence be restarted from SARS experience, by exploiting the large level of homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 3CL pro . According to the latest report of the structure of 3CL pro from SARS-CoV2 15 (PDB code 6LU7) and the available structure of 3CL pro from SARS-CoV, 12 (PDB code 1UK4), the two main proteases differ by only 12 amino acids, with \u03b1 carbon atoms all lying at least 1 nm away from the 3CL pro active site (see Figure 1a ). The substrate-binding pockets (shown as a surface representation) of two Figure 1 : a):SARS-CoV2(orange, pdbcode 6LU7) and SARS-CoV (green, pdbcode 1UK4) main proteases. Violet spheres corresponds to the alpha carbons of the 12 differing residues in the two structures. Grey spheres indicate the CYS-HIS dyad b): Highlighted view of the binding pocket with the main residues in bond representation (green and red for SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV, respectively). The shaded region mark the binding site for the substrate (N3 compound in 6LU7 structure) coronavirus main proteases are compared in Figure 1b , exhibiting a strikingly high level of alignment of the key residues involved in substrate binding, including the CYS145\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 HIS41 dyad, and HIS163/HIS172. The latter residues, along with GLU166, are believed to provide the opening gate for the substrate in the active state of the protomer. 12 Figure 1 (a,b) strongly suggest that effective non-covalent inhibitors for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases should share the same structural and chemical features. In order to investigate this matter, we have performed a molecular modeling study on both the 6LU7 and 1UK4 PDB structures using a molecular docking approach. 6LU7 is the monomer of the main protease in the active state with the N3 peptidomimetic inhibitor 15 while 1UK4 is the dimer with the protomer chain A in the active state. 12 The main protease monomer contains three domains. Domains I and II (residues 8-101 and residues 102-184) are made of antiparallel \u03b2-barrel structures in a chymotrypsin-like fold responsible for catalysis. The substrate-binding site is located in a cleft between these two domains. 16 The 6LU7 structure was first fed to the PlayMolecule web application by Acellera 17 (www.playmolecule.org) using a novel and effective virtual screening technique for the multimodal structure-based ligand design, 18 called Ligand Generative Adversarial Network (LIGANN). Ligands in LIGANN are generated so as to match the shape and chemical attributes of the binding pocket and decoded into a sequence of SMILES enabling directly the structure-based de novo drug design. SMILES code for optimally shaped ligands were obtained using the default LIGANN values for shapes and channels with the cubic box center set at the midpoint vector connecting the SH and NE atoms of the CYS-HIS dyad in the 6LU7 crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV2 main protease monomer in the active state.",

Computed LogP values range from -0.5 to a max-imum of 5 with a number of rotatable bonds from 2 to a maximum of 12. Most of the LIGGAN compounds bear from 2 to 5 H-bond acceptor or donors. Values of \u2206G and LogP for each of the 93 compounds are reported in Table 1 of the Supporting Information. In Table   1 , the binding free energy data of these five best ligands are shown for both CoV proteases and both protonation states of the catalytic dyad. As previously inferred based on 3CL pro similarities (see Figure 1 ), inspection of Table 1 confirms that SARS-CoV2 best binders 27, 29, 39, 77, 19 are also good binders for SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Remarkably, compound 27 is consistently the most potent ligand for the two proteases, irrespectively of the dyad protonation state.

In order to assess the stability of the 3CL pro -27 association, we have performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the ligand-protein bound state with explicit solvent, using the GROMACS program. 2,3 The overall structural information was obtained by combining data from three independent simulations (for a total of about 120 ns), all started from the best docking pose of 27 on the 6LU7 monomeric structure with a different seed for initial velocity randomization. These simulations are performed following a state-of-theart technical protocol extensively described in Ref. 26 Further methodological aspects are provided in the Supporting Information. In Figure 5 , we show the probability distribution, P (R), of the distance R between the center of mass (CoM) of the ligand and that of the domains I+II of 3CL pro . The distribution has nearly a Gaussian shape with a half-width of about 1 \u00c5, exhibiting only a minor positive skewness and defining a tight binding site volume V site of few \u00c5 3 at most. 27 The MD-determined P (R) neatly shows that the ligand never leaves the binding pocket of the chymotripsyn-like fold at any stage during the whole simulation.",

As the road for delivering an effective anti-viral drug is still a long one indeed, the SARS-Cov2 harsh lesson, nonetheless, should not be forgotten once the emergency will end, hoping that our contribution can pave the way for the design of effective non-covalent antiviral drugs for the present and future Coronavirus emergencies.",

Upper panel: correlation diagram between ligand free energies obtained with the charged CYS \u22121 -HIS + (x-axis) and with neutral CYS-HIS (y-axis) dyad. Lower panel: correlation diagram between ligand free energies of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. (CYS \u2212 /HIS + ). The searching box for optimal docking was again approximately centered at the CYS-HIS dyad and full ligand flexibility was assumed. The minimum search was done using 50 cycles of Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm and empirical free energy scoring function with Babel-generated 20 Gesteiger atomic charges. Further details on Docking parameters are given in the Supporting Information.Results for the binding free energies of the 93 LIGGAN-determined 3CL pro ligands are reported inFigure 2. Binding free energies are comprised in the range 4-9 kcal/mol and are found to be strongly correlated for the two protonation states of the CYS-HIS dyad, hence indicating a weak dependency of the inhibition potency on pH in the range 6-8. Correlation is still quite high when ligand binding free energies for the main proteases are compared, confirming that good binders for SARS-CoV are, in general, also good binders for SARS-CoV2 3CL pro .",
