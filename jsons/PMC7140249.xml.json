            "text": "Management of infections in the ICU can be challenging due to the rise of multidrug-resistant organisms (Box 1\n). Among the most problematic pathogens are the following:\u2022ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli, which may be resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins\u2022For most ESBL-producing organisms, carbapenems, such as imipenem and meropenem, are the drugs of choice.\u2022\nP. aeruginosa is one of the leading causes of morbidity in ICU patients, especially those with VAP. It is also a common cause of ICU infections associated with devices and catheters, infections in the urinary tract, and surgical site infections.3\n\u2022Increasing rates of multidrug resistance have been noted, especially in immunocompromised hosts (Box 2\n), those patients with prolonged hospital stays, those patients with invasive devices or mechanical ventilation, and those patients with prior prolonged antibiotic use. Risk factors for acquiring pseudomonal infections are age, comorbidities at ICU admission (such as anemia and burns), and/or invasive devices.Box 2ICU infections in the immunocompromised patients\nIncreased risk\u2022Critically ill and immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for community-acquired, opportunistic, and nosocomial infections.\u2022Immunocompromised hosts include patients with neutropenia or hematologic malignancy; those patients on corticosteroids and other forms of immunosuppressive therapy; solid transplant patients; patients with hematopoietic stem transplant, HIV/AIDS, or asplenia; and patients on biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor l.\u2022The attenuated inflammatory response in these patients make it difficult to make an early diagnosis because clinical signs and symptoms are frequently atypical and nonspecific.\u2022Because these patients are always put on various prophylactic antimicrobials and have multiple hospitalizations, they are also at increased risk for multidrug-resistant organisms.\u2022Most infections in the immunocompromised patients present in a hierarchical pattern depending on the level of immunosuppression, neutropenia, and CD4 counts.\u2022Because morbidity and mortality are very high, early empiric antimicrobial therapy is universally indicated.\nHIV/AIDS\u2022Bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia, gastrointestinal (GI), and central nervous system infections occur at high frequency in HIV/AIDS patients, depending on CD4+ levels.\u2022Common pathogens include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumocystis, P. aeruginosa, endemic mycoses, Candida species, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides species, Toxoplasma gondii, and Listeria monocytogenes.\u2022Pathogens frequently encountered when the CD4+ levels less than 50 include mycobacterium avium complex, Cryptococcus neoformans, CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), although the advent of antiretroviral therapy has reduced the incidence of these pathogens.\u2022\nS aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common fatal bacterial infection in these patients irrespective of CD4+ levels.\u2022Diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients is often caused by protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum.\u2022Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a life-threatening complication of antiretroviral therapy, may occur, leading to an exuberant inflammatory response against a pathogen that may previously been latent.\nNeutropenia and other non-HIV immunocompromised hosts\u2022Gram-positive organisms are on the rise in neutropenia patients. These include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Corynebacterium species. Gram-negative bacilli include Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Klebsiella species.\u2022Empiric therapy covering both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms is recommended for febrile neutropenic patients\u2022Patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation present with a broad spectrum of infections overtime.7 During the postoperative period, the common infections include health care\u2013associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and catheter-associated and device-associated infections. The risk of opportunistic infections increases over time due to immunosuppressive therapy to prevent organ rejection.\n\u2022For the treatment of problematic multidrug-resistant pseudomonas, current treatment options include the following combinations:\u25cbCeftolozane/tazobactam\u25cbCeftazidime/avibactam\u25cbPiperacillin/tazobactam\u25cbCefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem plus an additional agent(s), such as colistin, fosfomycin, aminoglycoside, or a quinolone\n\u2022APPs working in the ICU should optimize dosing, frequency, and longer infusion time. It is good practice to combine time-dependent antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, and imipenem, with concentration-dependent antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin.\u2022\nAcinetobacter baumannii is also a major cause of VAP and bloodstream infections. Risk factors include longer ICU stay, recent surgery, mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic exposure. Data from the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System indicate that resistance of Acinetobacter species is on the rise.8\n\u2022For the treatment of susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter, APPs can use\u25cbBroad-spectrum cephalosporins\u25cb\u03b2-lactam\u2013\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations\u25cbCarbapenems\n\u2022For multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter isolates, APPs can use\u25cbPolymyxins, such as colistin\u25cbMinocycline\u25cbTigecycline\n\nBox 1Antimicrobial resistance and optimizing antibiotic use in the ICU\nPrevalence\u2022The prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms is increasing in the ICU,4, 5 leading to increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and higher costs.\u2022The emergence of resistance among gram-negative bacteria has significant implications because there are not many therapeutic options.\u2022The most encountered resistant pathogens include MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLs), P. aeruginosa resistant to imipenem, and fluoroquinolones.\nRisk factors\u2022Features that increase the risk of infection with multidrug resistant organisms in the ICU\u25cbOlder age\u25cbComorbid conditions, such as diabetes, immunodeficiency, and malignancies\u25cbFrequent hospitalizations and longer stays\u25cbIndwelling devices, such as catheters\u25cbFrequent utilization of antimicrobials\u25cbIn the neonatal ICUs, infections are commonly caused by rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, and adenovirus\n\nPrevention\u2022To reduce the emergency and spread of multidrug resistant pathogens in ICU, it is critical that\u25cbICU units establish strict comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship programs\u25cbEffective infection control measures and routine surveillance are implemented\u25cbHand hygiene is implemented and motivated\u25cbStandard and universal precautions are encouraged\u25cbPatients with chlorhexidine are decolonized\u25cbUnnecessary use of indwelling devices, such as catheters, is limited\u25cbEnvironmental surfaces are disinfected\n\nOptimizing antibiotic therapy in the ICU\u2022Principles governing antimicrobial therapy in the ICU include\u25cbEnsuring adequacy of the initial empiric therapy5\n\u25cbTiming and rapid initiation of empiric broad empiric broad antibiotics\u25cbSource-targeted and tissue-targeted therapy (eg, lungs, urinary tract, catheter, and abdomen)\u25cbNarrow antimicrobial choices based on microbiology and epidemiology data\u25cbConsidering host factors, such as immunosuppression and comorbidities\u25cbInitial patient response that should guide need for further work or antibiotic duration\u25cbTreating for the shortest effective duration6\n\u25cbAvoiding unnecessary combination therapy\n\n",

Table 1\nshows the commonly encountered species and their clinical features, work-up, management, and prevention. In the ICU, viral illness can be community acquired or nosocomial. Viruses can lead to multiple organ system complications. The most commonly affected systems are the respiratory, GI, neurologic systems, skin, and mucous membranes, which all eventually may lead to sepsis. Viral infections are also a major source of morbidity in the neonatal ICUs (Box 3\n) and are also a leading cause of central nervous system infections (Box 4\n). Prompt diagnosis and antiviral therapy are key to good outcomes. For long-term and population-wide prevention, immunization, prophylaxis, and infection control should routinely be encouraged.Box 3Nosocomial infections in the neonatal ICU\nBacterial\u2022The most common nosocomial bacterial species among neonates are Staphylococcus, Enterococci, Enterobacter, E coli, and group B streptococcus.\u2022The bloodstream is among the most frequent site of nosocomial infection followed by nosocomial pneumonia; GI; and eye, ear, nose, and throat sites.8\n\u2022The major risk factors are poor umbilical handling and central intravenous catheter use.\nViral\u2022Outbreaks of viral infections in the neonatal ICUs are commonly caused by rotavirus, RSV, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, and adenovirus.\u2022Nosocomial infections can be transmitted via droplet spread, hands of infected hospital personnel and other individuals, contaminated medical equipment, and breast milk from infected mothers. Other pathogens, such as HIV, hepatitis B/C, HSV, VZV, and CMV, can be transmitted vertically from infected mothers.\u2022The clinical manifestations can be severe requiring mechanical ventilation.\u2022Complications associated with nosocomial viral infections can be grouped into1.Respiratory complications, such as RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses2.GI complications, such as rotavirus (the most common GI virus for infants)3.Systemic disease, such as enterovirus and parechovirus\n\nBox 4Common infections of the central nervous system in the ICU patient\nBackground\u2022In critically ill patients, central nervous infections, such as meningitis and encephalitis, cause significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed early and treated promptly.\u2022Bacterial infections can lead to meningitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema, and sepsis.\u2022Viral infections can also cause meningitis, encephalitis, optic neuritis, and poliomyelitis.\nBacterial meningitis is often caused by\u2022\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (the most common causative agent)\u2022\nNeisseria meningitides\n\u2022\nHaemophilus influenzae\n\u2022\nListeria monocytogenes\n\nViral meningitis and encephalitis are often caused by\u2022Enteroviruses\u2022HSV\u2022West Nile virus\nClinical presentation\u2022Meningitis is characterized by the inflammation of the meninges surrounding the brain and the spinal cord.\u2022A triad of fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status in most but not all patients\u2022Cranial nerve palsies, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and photophobia\u2022Positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs\u2022Encephalitis is inflammation within the brain parenchyma. Clinical presentation is variable depending on the brain cells affected. Patients are more likely to present with altered level of conscience or confusion, coma, and focal or generalized seizures.\nDiagnosis\u2022Suspected patients should receive neuroimaging before lumbar puncture.9\n\u2022Bacterial meningitis is confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Positive findings for bacterial meningitis include\u25cbElevated opening pressure\u25cbPolymorphonuclear cell predominance\u25cbDecreased glucose concentration\u25cbElevated protein concentration\n\u2022In viral meningitis, opening pressure is usually normal, there is lymphocyte predominance, and CSF glucose is usually normal.\nTreatment\u2022The antimicrobial agent of choice must penetrate the blood-brain barrier and should be based on patient age and risk factors.\u2022Vancomycin plus ceftriaxone is the preferred empiric therapy.\u2022Ampicillin should be added to the initial empiric therapy in children, immunocompromised hosts, and the elderly (>50 years).2\n\u2022Patients with viral encephalitis can be managed with acyclovir.\n",

Vaccinations and effective infection control practice should be emphasized globally.Box 5Dealing with sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the ICU\n\u2022Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that results from an infection.\u2022Sepsis is described as severe if a patient develops end-organ dysfunction and hypotension that is not responsive to fluid resuscitation.\u2022The spectrum of sepsis causing pathogens is rapidly changing from predominantly gram-negative organisms to gram-positive organisms.\u2022Common clinical features for sepsis are\u25cbFever (>38.3\u00b0C)\u25cbHypothermia (<36\u00b0C)\u25cbHeart rate (>90 beats per minute)\u25cbTachypnea\u25cbAltered mental status\u25cbEdema\u25cbHyperglycemia (plasma glucose >120 mg/dL)\n\u2022Sepsis causes inflammatory, metabolic, and coagulation alterations. Laboratory evaluations may reveal2\n\u25cbLeukocytosis (white blood cell count >12,000/\u03bcL)\u25cbLeukopenia (white blood cell count <4000/\u03bcL)\u25cbPlasma C-reactive protein\u25cbPlasma procalcitonin\n\u2022Hemodynamic and tissue perfusion changes in a septic patient may include\u25cbArterial hypotension\u25cbHyperlactatemia (>1 mmol/L)\u25cbDecreased capillary refill\n\u2022When sepsis is suspected, clinicians should rapidly administer broad-spectrum antibiotics.\u2022The Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundle12 recommends the following:\u25cbMeasure and monitor lactate level.\u25cbObtain blood cultures prior to administration of antibiotics.\u25cbBegin rapid administration of crystalloid to manage hypotension and elevated lactate (>4 mmol/L).\u25cbApply vasopressors if patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain mean arterial pressure \u226565 mm Hg.\n\u2022Managing a sepsis patient involves a lot of supportive care. The first few hours should be dedicated to restoring adequate perfusion, providing antibiotics, and optimizing oxygen supply and demand\n",
