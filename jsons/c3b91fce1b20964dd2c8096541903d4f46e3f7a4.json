By early April, 2003, scientists from Canada, Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), Hong Kong and Europe had each identified a novel coronavirus never described before to be the causative agent for SARS, 6, [11] [12] [13] which was confirmed by the WHO on April 16, 2003 and was named SARS-CoV. 14 The first isolated coronavirus in Guangzhou, which is only 250 km away from Hong Kong, was confirmed on April 12, 2003 . The virus isolated from Guangzhou patients is the prototype of the SARS-CoV found in Hong Kong and countries around the world. 15 Two to three weeks later, these scientists, and also those from Singapore, had independently sequenced the genome of the SARS-CoV.

This is well illustrated by the example of infected guests in the affected Hong Kong hotel bringing SARS back to their home countries of Singapore, Vietnam and Canada, as mentioned earlier. Another example was the CA112 flight from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March 2003 on which a symptomatic passenger infected no less than nine tourists from Hong Kong to Beijing, three Taiwanese businessmen, one Singaporean and four Chinese. Since then, the WHO has issued guidelines on tight port control measures including temperature checks and health and contact screening forms for all passengers and crew. 19 The WHO has also regularly issued advice against nonessential travel to places badly affected by SARS, and the lists of countries/regions with recent local transmission of SARS was regularly updated and widely publicized. 20 Severe acute respiratory syndrome has not only caused enormous suffering in patients and families, but has also had profound impact on the economy. There is an immense global anxiety and even fear generated towards SARS. This is due to a number of reasons. The largely unknown nature of the novel infection; the lack of a rapid and reliable diagnostic test, effective treatment and vaccination; its alarming infectivity especially via superspreaders and in health care workers and families; the large number of relatively young and previously healthy people infected; the significant morbidity and ICU admission rate and the mortality of the disease have all contributed to the intense global anxiety. Furthermore, the very high profile that resulted from WHO and CDC travel advice and their listing of areas with recent local transmission of the disease; the tight and threatening quarantine policy and port infection control measures, and the intensive and often sensational media coverage of the disease with the closing down of hospitals, schools and wholesale markets, and with pictures of 'cities on the masks' have all imposed a tremendous adverse effect on travel and business around the world, and particularly in Asia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 416, "end": 418, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 759, "end": 761, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 984, "end": 986, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE SPREAD AND IMPACT ON TRAVEL AND ECONOMY"}, {"text": "During the peak of the SARS epidemic in May 2003, aircraft movement at the Hong Kong International Airport plunged by 49%, 21 and hotel occupancy rate dropped to an all time low level of 17% against a 83% rate in May 2002. 22 Similarly, Singapore Airlines and airlines in the mainland of China cancelled 50% and 78% of their flights. 23 The setback on tourism, business and the economy was enormous.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 125, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 223, "end": 225, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 334, "end": 336, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE SPREAD AND IMPACT ON TRAVEL AND ECONOMY"}, {"text": "Following the intense effort of local health authorities in the areas of isolation and quarantine control and following concerted international efforts in enhancing airport screenings, together with increasing knowledge of the disease and proper health education on personal hygiene, the SARS epidemic rapidly came under control in June 2003.

A number of questions remain unanswered. The origin of the new virus, its modes of transmission other than by droplets and fomites, its infectivity during its incubation period and after clinical recovery, and its natural history are all unknown. We need also to define its pathogenesis and the host reactions to the virus in order to establish the most effective treatment, if any, for this new disease. Current treatments are empirical and not based on randomized control trials. Whether it has become an endemic disease that will return in winter will also need to be established.

First, SARS is of great global significance. It provides a warning that in this age of globalization and heavy international air traffic, any outbreak of infectious disease can rapidly spread around the world to cause a severe adverse impact on health and economy, and must be dealt with by a concerted international effort. Second, the WHO is in a unique position to alert international health authorities, coordinate international medical, scientific and educational efforts and to disseminate information and advice. It is sobering to reflect that it took several years for scientists to isolate the HIV virus and to sequence its genome. The agent responsible for SARS was isolated within a few weeks due to the fact that scientists from 11 laboratories put aside their competitiveness and worked together under the WHO's leadership (together with advances in modern technology, of course). It is hoped that this will serve as a model for any future infectious disease outbreak to facilitate control and prevention of communicable diseases. Third, the outbreak has shown clearly that early reporting of an outbreak of infectious disease to neighbouring countries/regions and the WHO, together with early implementation of appropriate infection control and quarantine measures, is essential for containment and control of the infection. Fourth, we need to revisit the human-animal habitat. The SARS coronavirus is believed to have jumped from an animal host to people. The closeness between man and animals in southern China could provide an ecosystem for the interaction of their viruses and increase the likelihood that two strains will recombine genetically to produce a deadly new variant. An excellent example is provided by the avian flu. A recent study has detected SARS-CoV-like viruses in Himalayan palm civets, a raccoon-dog and humans in the same live-animal market in Guangdong, southern China. 24 Although the animal reservoir of SARS-CoV is not entirely clear, we need to revisit the eating habit (wild game) and lifestyle in Hong Kong and southern China. Finally, medical scientists and health care professionals in the Asian Pacific region have shown that they can stand up to the challenge of completely newly emerging infections. They have fought bravely to contain the disease and have contributed significantly to detecting the causative virus. We must remain vigilant as SARS has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience with the brief resurgence of cases in Toronto and most recently suspected cases in British Columbia in Canada in mid-August 2003 and a confirmed case in Singapore announced on 9 September 2003. The WHO has recommended that even without new case resurgence, we should have at least a full year of surveillance to determine whether the disease has established itself as an endemic disease. 25 Let us all remain on guard.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2001, "end": 2003, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2922, "end": 2924, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "REVELATIONS AND LESSONS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Our strategies for fighting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Zhong", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["Q"], "last": "Zeng", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Am.
