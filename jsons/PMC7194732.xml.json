The World Health Organization refers to a super-spreader as a patient (or an event) that may transmit infection to a larger number of individuals than is usual by one individual (or event). In the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) situation, a super-spreading event was defined as the transmission of SARS to at \u22658 contacts, and other authors defined this as individuals infecting an unusually large number of secondary cases [1,2]. A super-spreading event could merely be defined as an event in which one patient infects far more people than an average patient does, which is estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0).",

Serologic testing in the case of SARS-CoV showed a positive rate of 13% in asymptomatic individuals compared with 82% in severe disease and 4% in those with mild symptoms [10]. One study indicated that an asymptomatic patient with COVID-19 transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 to another patient in Germany [11].",
