Nowadays, the information needs of the users can be directly satisfied through entity-oriented search, by taking into account the entities that better relate to the query, as opposed to relying exclusively on the best matching terms. Evolving from keyword-based to entity-oriented search poses several challenges, not only regarding the understanding of natural language queries, which are more familiar to the end-user, but also regarding the integration of unstructured documents and structured information sources such as knowledge bases. One opportunity that remains open is the research of unified frameworks for the representation and retrieval of heterogeneous information sources. The doctoral work we present here proposes graph-based models to promote the cooperation between different units of information, in order to maximize the amount of available leads that help the user satisfy an information need.",

On one side, we propose the joint representation of terms, entities and their relations, as a collection-based model of corpora and knowledge bases. Our idea is to provide a novel way to index documents and entities such that, from design, the aim is to seamlessly integrate units of information of different types, providing a higher-level of flexibility and expressiveness than the inverted index or the triplestore alone. On the other side, we propose a universal ranking function that should be issued over the representation model that we design, in order to rank the different units of information, based on other input units of information. The goal is to obtain a unique ranking function that, depending on the query and the target result, will be able to solve several tasks from entity-oriented search, be it document and entity retrieval or the recommendation-alike tasks of related entity finding and entity list completion.",

            "text": "Classical information retrieval has focused on the representation of documents and their features, as well as the retrieval and ranking of those documents based on a representation model-usually the inverted index. Entity-oriented search, however, relies simultaneously on corpora and knowledge bases, which have mismatching representation models-usually the inverted index and the quad indexes in a triplestore. Moreover, if we look at the definitions of 'information retrieval' and 'entity-oriented search', which are ten years apart, we will find a collision between two paradigms that are seemingly different. While the first is focused on unstructured data (documents), the second largely relies on structured data (entities and relations). Moreover, entity-oriented search also incorporates ad hoc document retrieval, as long as it leverages entities [2, Ch. 8] . This collision of definitions, along with the consideration for both documents and entities, means that an integration of representation and/or retrieval models must happen at one of the stages of indexing and/or search. One way to tackle the problem is through separated subsystems based on an inverted index and a triplestore, which either independently respond to the query or contribute with different signals to the final scores. Another way to approach the problem is by considering data as a joint representation of corpora and knowledge bases-also known as combined data, according to Bast et al. [4, Def. 2.3] .",

Bast and Buchhold [3] have justified the need for such a unified framework based on the example of a friendship relation that could only be found in the text, but should influence retrieved triples by establishing new connections. One way to tackle this problem and to build a seamless model of text and knowledge is to use graphs, since they have already been used for the retrieval of documents [5, 11] and entities [1, 14] . While models like the graph-of-word [11] were designed to answer keyword-based queries with a list of ranked documents, entities in a knowledge graph like DBpedia [1] are still more frequently retrieved through a structured query language like SPARQL [9] . Our goal is to propose a unified model that is able to support the ranking of documents and entities, for a given keyword query, entity, or set of entities, without the need for a structured query language. At the same time, the model should retain the complex relations between entities, exploiting them for all tasks.",

We evaluated both models based on subsets of the INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection, measuring mean average precision, precision at a cutoff of 10 and normalized discounted cumulative gain for the top-p results. While we were able to propose a hypergraph-based model and a universal ranking function (the random walk score), we have only tested ad hoc document retrieval and ad hoc entity retrieval.
