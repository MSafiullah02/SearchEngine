In addition, the host serine protease TMPRSS2 is essential for processing of the viral S protein, which is prerequisite for S protein-ACE2 interaction and infection of the host. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 by camostat mesylate prevents SARS-CoV2 entry into cells in vitro. (2, 3) . Another study demonstrated that TMPRSS2 increases the entry of SARS-CoV not only by processing of the S protein, but also by processing of the host receptor ACE2 (4). TMPRSS2-deficient mice had decreased viral spread in the airways compared to control mice after infection with SARS-CoV (5).",

We chose to overexpress TMPRSS2 in a human cell line, HEK-293T, commonly used for experimentation, because of its high transfectability. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates revealed a band at ~60 kD in TMPRSS2-transfected cells but not in control cells ( Figure 1A ). GAPDH was used as a loading control. The trypsin-like activity of the transfected cells using the fluorogenic peptide substrate BOC-QAR-AMC revealed a >2.5-fold increase in the proteolytic activity of the TMPRSS2-transfected cells compared with that of control cells (p = 0.0002; Figure 1B ). The proteolytic activity of the TMPRSS2transfected cells increased over time compared with that of control cells ( Figure 1C ). The mean proteolytic rate per minute of the TMPRSS2-transfected cells was increased by >3.5 fold compared to the proteolytic rate of control cells (p < 0.0001, Figure 1D ). The proteolytic activity could be measured hours after addition of the substrate, and the average proteolytic activity per hour was increased by >2 fold in TMPRSS2overexpressing cells compared with control cells (p = 0.0008, Figure 1E ). These collective data demonstrate that overexpression of TMPRSS2 results in overproduction of functional TMPRSS2 and that the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 can be accurately measured.",

As expected, camostat mesylate inhibited the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 even at the lowest concentration of 100 nM ( Figure 2A ). We then tested whether SLPI would inhibit TMPRSS2. However, none of the concentrations tested inhibited TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity ( Figure 2B ). Next, we tested, human A1AT. A1AT inhibited TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner with peak effects seen at 1 \u00b5M ( Figure 2C ). In addition, we tested AEBSF, a drug with proteolytic inhibition activity that was shown to inhibit influenza infection in a murine model of pre-infection treatment (6) . AEBSF inhibited TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity in a dosedependent manner, with peak inhibition seen at concentrations of 1 \u00b5M ( Figure 2D ). We tested BHH, an FDA-approved drug used in a mucolytic cough suppressant that was reported to have inhibitory capacity toward TMPRSS2 (7) . BHH inhibited TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner, although this drug was less potent than A1AT or AEBSF ( Figure 2E ).

A1AT is mainly synthesized in the liver and found in high concentrations in the blood under normal conditions. A1AT concentration in the blood can be increased by 6-fold as part of the acute phase of inflammation or tissue injury (16) . As a drug, A1AT is delivered to several organs, including the lungs, where it inhibits primarily neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G. Neutrophil elastase cleaves several structural proteins in the lungs and processes several innate immune mediators. In addition, A1AT promotes clearance of apoptotic cells (17) . Therefore, A1AT is considered to be a protective protein that inhibits tissue damage and inflammatory response. Variable mutations in the A1AT gene cause deficiency of functional protein, resulting in proteolytic lung damage and panlobular emphysema (18) . Augmentation treatment of A1AT has been approved for the treatment of A1AT deficiency (19) .",

Therefore, we suggest that A1AT delivery can potentially decrease the pathogenicity of COVID-19 by inhibiting the alveolar inflammatory response in addition to its role as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Notably, truncated forms of A1AT are significantly increased in the serum of patients with SARS compared to control patients, and the truncated A1AT levels correlate with disease severity (22) . These findings suggest that A1AT may be a part of a natural protective mechanism to fight coronavirus infection and acute lung disease. A1AT belongs to the super family of serine protease inhibitors (SERPIN) that inhibits serine and cysteine proteases. Proteases interact with SERPINs and, in turn, cleave the serpins' reactive center loop. This cleavage results in a conformational change of the serpins such that they form covalent bonds with target proteases and irreversibly block their activity (23) . Therefore, the truncated A1AT observed in patients with SARS may be a result of cleavage of functional A1AT by proteases, such TMPRSS2, and other enzymes, such as neutrophil elastase.",

These protease inhibitors have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV2 entry to host cells by inhibiting S protein priming by TMPRSS2 and binding of the virus to ACE2 (Figure 3 ). A1AT may be particularly effective as it has dual capacity, inhibiting TMPRSS2 (and hence viral uptake and subsequent replication) and possessing anti-inflammatory activity. We suggest that using these inhibitors may be therapeutic in conditions in which TMPRSS2 function is pathogenic, such as in prostate cancer and several types of coronavirus and influenza infections. The ready availability of A1AT calls attention to its potential clinical use for the COVID-19 pandemic. processes the S protein on the SARS-CoV2 envelope in a process called priming. Priming of the S protein is necessary for binding between the S protein and the host receptor ACE2. TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat mesylate, A1AT, AEBSF, and BHH prevent the priming of the S protein and therefore block virus entry. In addition, inhibition of TMPRSS2 prevents processing of ACE2, which decreases the infectivity of the coronavirus.",
