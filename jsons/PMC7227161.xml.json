Asymptomatic infected individuals might also serve as the source of infection, which made the outbreak difficult to control. Inhalation and contact transmission are the two major modes of transmission. The incubation period is within 1\u201314 days, and most patients represented with an incubation period of 3\u20137 days. Common symptoms included fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), and dry cough (59.4%).[3,8] Wang et al. summarized 138 cases of COVID-19 and demonstrated some relative common symptoms such as anorexia (39.9%), myalgia (34.8%), dyspnea (31.2%), expectoration (26.8%), pharyngalgia (17.4%), diarrhea (10.1%), and nausea (10.1%). Unusual symptoms included dizziness (9.4%), headache (6.5%), vomiting (3.6%), and abdominal pain (2.2%). Severe patients usually developed dyspnea and hypoxemia 1 week later. Fatal complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intractable metabolic acidosis, septic shock, and coagulation dysfunction, and some patients developed arrhythmia, acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury. Lymphopenia commonly occurred in patients with COVID-19, with elevated lactate dehydrogenase, hepatic enzyme, creatine kinase, and C-reactive protein.[8] Chest computed tomographic scans usually revealed multifocal small patchy shadows and interstitial changes in the peripheral of lung and then bilateral multiple ground glass opacity. Consolidation could also be observed in severe cases. RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 using nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, serum, or stool samples of patients were available but needed repeat testing. Whole genome sequencing of the virus is available in some assigned laboratories.",

Once attached to ACE2 by SARS-CoV, the ectodomain of ACE2 is cleaved, accompanied by endocytosis of transmembrane domain into the cell. Sometimes ACE2 can be internalized as an intact molecule. The internalization and virus particle\u2013host cell fusion are essential for virus entry (Figure 2).[17]",

COVID-19 virus had a close relationship with two other SARS-like coronaviruses that are derived from bat, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, with 88% identity. However, COVID-19 virus has less genetical similarity with SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).[5] Phylogenetic analysis indicated that COVID-19 virus was a new betacoronavirus from the subgenus Sarbecovirus.[5] Spike protein sequences of COVID-19 virus and SARS-CoV were compared; the overall sequence similarities between the spike of these two viruses were about 76%\u201378% for the whole protein, around 73%\u201376% for the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and 50%\u201353% for the receptor-binding motif (RBM). These high similarities strongly suggested that COVID-19 virus used ACE2 as its receptor.[18] Recently, Wrapp et al. examined a 3.5-\u00c5-resolution cryo-EM structure of the COVID-19 spike (S) trimer in the prefusion conformation. They discovered that COVID-19 S shared the same mechanism of triggering similar to other viruses in the Coronaviridae. To be specific, receptor binding to exposed RBDs resulted to an unstable 3 RBD up conformation leading to shedding of S1 and refolding of S2. Biophysical and structural evidence showed that the COVID-19 S bound ACE2 with 10- to 20- fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. The high affinity of COVID-19 S for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) might facilitate it to spread from human to human.[19] Bao et al.[20] conformed that COVID-19 virus could infect the hACE2 transgenic mice and induce typical interstitial pneumonia, whereas wild-type mice could not be infected by the virus. Moreover, the COVID-19 S protein and hACE2 receptor were discovered to colocalize in alveolar epithelial cells.[20] These results further supported that the COVID-19 virus uses the hACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.",

            "text": "ACE2 belongs to the M2 family of metalloproteases, with their catalytic active site exposed to the extracellular surface, which promotes the metabolism of circulating peptides. ACE2 cleaves Ang I to produce the presumably inactive Ang 1-9 peptide, and Ang 1-9 can be further metabolized into Ang 1-7 by ACE or other peptidases.[10, 11] ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang 1-7 with much higher efficiency than metabolizing Ang I to generate Ang 1-9.[21] Ang 1-7 peptide interacts with Mas receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, to exert vasodilation and antiproliferative effect, opposite to ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway[22, 23, 24, 25] (Figure 1). Evidences have shown that Ang 1-7 have a variety of protective effects on cardiovascular system, including anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antifibrosis, antihypertrophic, antiarrhythmia, and natriuretic effect. It also mediates inhibition of plaque formation and improvement of vascular dysfunction associated with metabolic syndrome.[26] ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas pathway has been proved to exert beneficial effects in various animal models of hypertension, heart failure, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.[27] Besides, ACE2 can cleave an amino acid from the C-terminus of the peptides Apelin-13 in vitro, which makes Apelin-13 lose its hypotensive action.[21]",

After the spike protein of the virus contacts ACE2, the whole molecule or transmembrane region of ACE2 along with the virus enters the cell through endocytosis (internalization) with the help of clathrin. Spike is activated by trypsin or furin, which mediates membrane fusion, and viral RNAs are released into intracellular space; then SARS infection is established. [15] ADAM17, a transmembrane proteinase, can cleave the extracellular juxta-membrane region of ACE2; then the catalytically active ectodomain was released into the extracellular milieu.[35] This process is nominated as shedding (Figure 2). Although the role of ACE2 shedding remains unclear, some studies indicated that shedding might be associated with cellular entry and replication of SARS-CoV, because an ADAM17 inhibitor restrains SARS-CoV replication in vitro.[36] In summary, ACE2 internalization and shedding reduced the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of ALI and may be life-threatening. It is characterized as diffuse damage to alveolar capillary, triggered by multiple diseases such as severe pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis, and trauma. Pathological findings include increased lung permeability; edema fluid rich in neutrophils, macrophages, and protein in the alveolar spaces; and the formation of hyaline membranes.[37,38] Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, the role of RAAS in ARDS/ALI has attracted extensive attentions. In an animal model of ALI by aspiration of gastric contents, acid aspiration markedly increased Ang II levels in plasma and lungs of wild-type mice, but genetic inactivation of ACE remarkably decreased Ang II levels both in plasma and lungs in the same acid injury model.[39] A latest research by Liu et al. also showed that patients infected by COVID-19 represented with increased levels of Ang\u2161.[40] Compared with wild-type mice, ACE\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected against ALI caused by acid aspiration to some extent, and the protection effect reduced to a lesser extent in ACE+/\u2212 mice; meanwhile, genetic deficiency of AT1a receptor in Agtr1a\u2212/\u2212 mice also largely improved the lung function compared with wild-type mice, indicating a mediation role of ACE/Ang II/AT1R in the ALI model.[39] Ang II levels in the lung tissue were markedly elevated in mice treated with Spike-Fc of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the inhibition of AT1R alleviated pulmonary edema and ALI in Spike-Fc-treated mice, indicating that deregulation of RAAS was a crucial mechanism in ALI induced by SARS-CoV spike.[30] Compared with a control cohort, patients with ARDS showed an increased frequency of D/D genotype in ACE gene. Besides, the ACE D/D allele was associated with higher mortality in the ARDS group compared with I/I allele. These results demonstrated that the ACE insertion/ deletion (I/D) polymorphism was related to susceptibility and prognosis of ARDS.[41] In summary, ACE/Ang\u2161/AT1R signaling might mediate the pathogenesis of ALI.",

The deleterious effect of ACE2 gene deficiency on sepsis-induced ALI was also proved, and ACE2 gene deficiency also increased mortality.[39] In order to examine if loss of ACE2 is essential for pathogenesis of ALI, Imai et al. performed a rescue experiment by injecting rhuACE2; they found out that rhuACE2 decreased the degree of ALI in acid-treated ACE2 knockout mice. The protective effect of rhuACE2 could also be observed when injected to acid-treated wild-type mice. However, catalytically inactive ACE2 protein (mut-rhuACE2) could not reverse the severe lung phenotype of ACE2 knockout mice or attenuate the severity of ALI in wild-type mice after acid instillation.[39] These findings indicated that the catalytic activity of ACE2 could protect lung from ALI directly.",

ACE2 null mice showed impaired cardiac contractility, accompanied by the decrease in blood pressure. Abnormality of cardiac structure could also be observed, with ventricular dilatation and thinning of the ventricular wall.

Sham-operated ACE2(\u2212/y) mice exhibited normal cardiac function and morphology, whereas ACE2(\u2212/y) mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation. [46] Treatment with AT1 receptor blockers or double knock-out mice of ACE and ACE2 genes reversed the cardiac phenotype in ACE2 knock-out mice.

For instance, in MI mice model induced by left anterior descending artery ligation, the expression of ACE2 was increased in the affected myocardium in wild-type mice. ACE2 null mice were more susceptible to MI and suffered from increased infarct size, more obvious ventricular remodeling, and increased mortality. The mechanism of this phenomenon might include increased cardiac Ang II levels, decreased Ang 1-7 levels, and increased reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 levels, MMP9 levels, and neutrophilic infiltration. Treatment with AT1 receptor blocker in ACE2(\u2212/y)-MI mice alleviated this process. [48] So, ACE2 may minimize the adverse myocardial injury and adverse ventricular remodeling by antagonizing ACE/Ang II/AT1R.",

In patients with myocardial infection of SARS-CoV, macrophage infiltration increased significantly, and there were signs of myocardial injury.

            "text": "ACE2 is localized mainly in the apical membrane of the epithelial cells in the proximal tubules, colocalizing with ACE.[50,51] ACE2 also exists in glomerular podocytes, mesangial cells, and renal vascular system.[50] In the kidney, ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis are antagonistic to each other. The balance between them is of great significance for the maintenance of normal renal physiology. ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis promotes sodium reabsorption and vasoconstriction and induces cell proliferation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. ACE2 degrades Ang II, generating Ang 1-7, which interacts with Mas receptor, counteracting the harmful effects mediated by Ang II.[52] ACE/ACE2 ratio is upregulated in many pathological conditions, including diabetes,[51] hypertension, [53,54], hypertensive nephrosclerosis,[55] and diabetic nephropathy.[56] Ye et al. studied the expression of ACE and ACE2 in the kidney of mice model of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (db/ db).[50] They found that in the early stage of diabetes, the expression of ACE2 in the renal cortex of db/db mice increased, whereas the expression of ACE decreased. This pattern of increased expression of ACE2 may be a renal protective response in the early stage of diabetes, but with the progress of the disease, the expression level and activity of ACE2 may be reduced. At the same time, some studies showed that in db/db mice, kidney ACE2 shedding to the urine increased,[57] which might be due to the upregulation of ADAM17 mediated by hyperglycemia.[58] Treating with ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760, led to the increase of proteinuria and aggravation of pathological changes in the kidneys of db/db diabetic mice and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. These pathological changes can be reversed by using AT1 receptor blocker.[50,59]. The possible mechanism of Ang II/ AT1R pathway induced renal damage may be that the combination of Ang II and AT1R activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatase (NADPH), increases the oxidative stress response in the kidney, and leads to renal vasoconstriction, vascular damage, renal tubular damage, and fibrosis.[60] Therefore, we concluded that the decreased expression of ACE2 promoted the occurrence and development of renal diseases and ACE2 played a protective role in kidney by reducing the level of Ang II.",
