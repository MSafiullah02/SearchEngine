Urease production correlates with the degree of colonization and the occurrence of gastritis in biopsy results.22 A urease breath test is available for humans to aid in diagnosis, and a similar test has been used in ferrets under research conditions but is not practical for clinical use.55 Gastric atrophy and hypochlorhydria are associated with the ability of H. mustelae to persistently colonize the stomach; hypochlorhydria due to loss of parietal cells allows non\u2013urease-producing bacteria to colonize the stomach as well.22\nHelicobacter species inhibit secretion of acid by parietal cells in vitro, and this mechanism may also contribute to hypochlorhydria.26 In humans, chronic infection with H. pylori is associated with release of cytokines that impair function of enterochromaffin cells, which are neuroendocrine cells in the gastric mucosa that control acid secretion by releasing histamine. The impaired secretory function of these cells may predispose to hypochlorhydria and gastric carcinogenesis. Loss of parietal cells due to chronic inflammation is, however, the primary cause of achlorhydria in humans and ferrets colonized with their respective Helicobacter species.67\n",

Oral veterinary or pediatric amoxicillin suspensions are palatable and well accepted by most ferrets; metronidazole can be compounded into a suspension for oral administration. Although H. mustelae is sensitive to either amoxicillin or metronidazole, treatment with one of these antibiotics alone or single treatment with other antibiotics is ineffective for eradication therapy. Other drug combinations have been used in ferrets to eradicate H. mustelae, with advantages of improved palatability and convenience of dosing. Clarithromycin (Biaxin, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) (12.5 mg/kg PO q8h) in combination with ranitidine bismuth (24 mg/kg q8h) has been shown to eradicate H. mustelae in ferrets.53 Ranitidine bismuth citrate tablets (not available in the United States) may be crushed and mixed with a palatable liquid or compounded, and clarithromycin is available as a pediatric suspension. Both drugs are administered for 14 to 21 days (dosages are given in Table 3-1). A combination of clarithromycin, metronidazole, and omeprazole or clarithromycin and omeprazole proved more effective than triple therapy with amoxicillin, metronidazole, and omeprazole in eradicating H. mustelae in research ferrets.2 Resistance to clarithromycin has not yet been reported in ferrets but does occur in humans.53 To prevent development of macrolide-resistant strains, clarithromycin should be combined with a second antibiotic not in the macrolide class.2 Chloramphenicol has no effect on H. mustelae.61 Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (8 mg/kg PO q8h) may be substituted for bismuth subsalicylate.",

            "text": "Palpate the abdomen of an emaciated ferret. Grossly thickened areas of bowel in ferrets with PBD and eosinophilic gastroenteritis are sometimes palpable. A focal area of pain in the abdomen is more typical of the presence of a GI foreign body. Splenomegaly is common in ferrets in association with many diseases, and mesenteric lymph nodes are likely to be enlarged in ferrets with any of the wasting diseases. Projectile vomiting has been reported in one ferret with eosinophilic gastroenteritis.18 Although rectal prolapse is not pathognomonic for PBD, this diagnosis is highly probable in a ferret with prolapse associated with diarrhea and weight loss. In young ferrets (younger than 16 weeks of age and usually younger than 10 weeks), coccidiosis may be associated with diarrhea and rectal prolapse but is rarely associated with significant weight loss. Both Aleutian disease and lymphosarcoma are insidious; thin ferrets will have lost condition over a period of weeks or months and may not have diarrhea.",

Ferrets with eosinophilic gastroenteritis usually have dramatic eosinophilia (10% to 35% eosinophils compared with 3% to 5% in normal ferrets). Ferrets with lymphosarcoma may not be leukemic, and further tests, such as peripheral lymph node biopsy or a splenic aspirate, are necessary for diagnosis. Inflammation associated with PBD often causes leukocytosis with neutrophilia and a left shift. Ferrets with bleeding ulcers are usually anemic (normal hematocrit is 40% to 55% in spayed or neutered pets, lower in jills in estrus). Dehydration may mask mild anemia and hypoproteinemia in emaciated animals; therefore repeat the CBC after rehydration. Aleutian disease may cause diarrhea, anemia, leukocytosis, and wasting. Serologic tests for Aleutian disease virus are available (see Chapter 5), but many ferrets with positive test results are asymptomatic for Aleutian disease. Clinicians should not assume that illness in ferrets that are seropositive for Aleutian disease virus is caused by the virus.",

While waiting for results of diagnostic tests, if the ferret is treated for only one disease, the time required for recognizing treatment failure may be the factor that ultimately decides if the ferret will survive. Unfortunately, the effective drugs used for treating the diseases associated with wasting are different, and therapy necessitates multiple daily doses of several drugs for at least 2 weeks. Because the gut flora of ferrets is very simple and plays no vital role in digestion, long-term administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics does not cause dysbiosis and diarrhea in ferrets as it does in many species. Emaciated ferrets that die despite proper treatment usually have either very extensive gastric ulcers or severe ileitis, each of which drastically reduces the absorption of essential nutrients. The age of the animal may sometimes help in the differential diagnosis; young ferrets are more likely to develop PBD, whereas older ferrets develop inflammatory bowel disease or severe, chronic gastritis associated with H. mustelae infection.29 Also, H. mustelae\u2013associated disease is more often associated with stress factors common in mature pet ferrets, such as concurrent disease or surgery (see Table 3-2).",

Some animals refuse to eat their regular diet of dry pellets but do accept the same food mixed with water and heated in a microwave until it develops a porridge-like consistency. Supplemental foods formulated specifically for carnivores such as Carnivore Care (Oxbow Animal Health) or Emeraid Carnivore (Lafebervet.com) are readily accepted by most ferrets when fed by syringe. Alternatively, offer nutritional recovery foods formulated for dogs and cats such as Maximum-Calorie (The Iams Company, Dayton, OH) or Canine a/d (Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition); most sick ferrets accept these foods readily. Nutritional recovery diets such as these can be used as the sole source of nutrition for several weeks if necessary. When using these diets, calculate a minimum daily intake of 400 kcal per kilogram of body weight. Sick ferrets may not make the effort to get up and drink from a water bottle but do usually drink from a dish. Offer fresh food and water by hand several times daily during hospitalization and home care; ferrets often take a few mouthfuls of every new offering but never go back for more. The first 2 days are critical for an animal that has lost 40% to 50% of its body weight, and intensive supportive care is essential.",
