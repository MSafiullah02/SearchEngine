Another calicivirus, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus, attaches to H type 2 histo-blood group oligosaccharide present on rabbit epithelial cells. Our aim was to test if, by analogy, recombinant NV-like particles (rNV VLPs) use carbohydrates present on human gastroduodenal epithelial cells as ligands. Methods: Attachment of rNV VLPs was tested on tissue sections of the gastroduodenal junction and on saliva from individuals of known ABO, Lewis, and secretor phenotypes. It was also tested on human Caco-2 cells and on animal cell lines transfected with glycosyltransferases complementary DNA (cDNA). Competition experiments were performed with synthetic oligosaccharides and anticarbohydrate antibodies. Internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy. Results: Attachment of rNV VLPs to surface epithelial cells of the gastroduodenal junction as well as to saliva was detected, yet only from secretor donors. It was abolished by \u24231,2fucosidase treatment, and by competition with the H types 1 and 3 trisaccharides or with anti-H type 1 and anti-H types 3/4 antibodies. Transfection of CHO and TS/A cells with an \u24231,2fucosyltransferase cDNA allowed attachment of VLPs. These transfectants as well as differentiated Caco-2 cells expressing H type 1 structures internalized the bound particles.

Among NLVs, at least 2 genogroups are defined, based on sequence comparison of both structural and nonstructural genes. 12, 13 Their genomic RNA is about 7.5-kb long and predicted to encode 3 open reading frames. Open reading frame 2 encodes the major viral capsid protein, which has a molecular weight of 58 kilodaltons. 14 -16 Until now, HuCVs have proven refractory to growth in cell culture, greatly impairing the study of their biologic properties. However, production of the capsid protein by insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus results in the spontaneous generation of virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from authentic virions. 17 Such purified VLPs allow the generation of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-NV anti-bodies that can be used for diagnostic assays 18 -20 and study of virus-cell interactions. 21, 22 Among many cell lines tested, only differentiated Caco-2 cells allowed significant attachment of recombinant NV (rNV) VLPs. 21 Caco-2 cells originate from a human colorectal carcinoma and have retained the ability to spontaneously differentiate into small intestine enterocytes in culture after reaching confluency. A monoclonal anti-rNV VLP was found to inhibit the interaction between differentiated Caco-2 cells and the VLPs. 21 Epitope mapping of this antibody revealed that it recognizes an epitope lying on the P2 domain of the capsid protein and structural analysis of the rNV capsids indicates that this domain forms a protrusion emanating from the capsid shell. 23, 24 These results are consistent with the idea that the P2 domain is responsible for the attachment of NV particles to Caco-2 cells.

They may also be present as free oligosaccharides in biologic fluids such as milk. Their synthesis requires several glycosyltransferases acting on precursor oligosaccharides. Four main types of precursors are usually recognized that have in common a terminal galactose in \u2424linkage to either an N-acetylglucosamine (type 1: galactose (Gal)\u2424 N-acetylglucosamine \u2424-R, and type 2 Gal\u24241-4 N-acetylglucosamine \u2424-R) or an N-acetylgalactosamine (type 3: Gal\u24241-3 N-acetylgalactosamine \u2423-R, and type 4: Gal\u24241-3 N-acetylgalactosamine \u2424-R). These precursors are converted into H antigenic structures by fucosylation in \u24231,2linkage, a step catalyzed by an \u24231,2fucosyltransferase for which 2 genes have been cloned and designated FUT1 and FUT2 in humans. The corresponding enzymes have previously been termed H type and secretor type, respectively. The H oligosaccharides can thereafter be substituted on the galactose by an N-acetylgalactosamine or a galactose in \u24231,3 linkage to give the A and B antigens, respectively, this step being catalyzed by the enzyme products of the A and B alleles at the ABO locus. Inactivating mutations of the FUT1 and FUT2 genes are known. FUT1 inactivating mutations are very rare and responsible for the Bombay phenotype characterized by the lack of ABH antigens on erythrocytes and vascular endothelium. In contrast, FUT2 inactivating mutations are frequent and responsible for the nonsecretor phenotype found in about 20% of the European and North American populations and characterized by the absence of ABH antigens from saliva as well as from most epithelial cells of the respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts. Additionally, a fucose residue can be added in \u24231,3 or \u24231,4 linkage on the type 1 or type 2 precursors by \u24231,3 or \u24231,4 fucosyltransferases.

Both the anti-H types 3 and 4 mAb and the H type 3 trisaccharide gave a partial inhibition ( Figure  2D and H ).

To get a more quantitative estimate of the qualitative results obtained on tissue sections, saliva samples from individuals phenotyped and genotyped as either secretors or nonsecretors were coated onto enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates and the ability of rNV VLPs to bind was assessed. In agreement with the histochemistry experiments, strong binding occurred on saliva from 4 of 4 secretors but not from 4 of 4 nonsecretors ( Figure 3A ). In addition, this binding was clearly inhibited by the H type 1 and H type 3 trisaccharides, whereas the closely related H type 2, type 1 precursor, or Lewis a oligosaccharides showed little or no inhibition ( Figure 3B ). These inhibitions required concentrations of free oligosaccharides about 4 orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of capsid protein. In addition, a preincubation step between the oligosaccharides and the rNV VLPs was required to obtain inhibition of the rNV VLPs attachment to saliva.

FTB is the rat homologue of human FUT2 and we recently showed that, like its human counterpart, it catalyzes the transfer of a fucose on either precursor, yet with a clear preference for types 1, 3, and 4 over type 2. 34 Neither parental CHO cells nor TS/A cells have detectable \u24231,2fucosyltransferase activity and, consequently, they are devoid of A, B, or H histo-blood group antigens. However, after transfection with the FTB cDNA, both cell lines express H types 2 and 3 and 4 determinants, but not H type 1 (Figure 4 ). The lack of H type 1 epitopes on these transfectants is likely caused by an absence of type 1 precursor, as in the case of CHO cells. 35 When assayed by flow cytometry, binding of rNV VLPs to these H antigen-expressing CHO and TS/A transfectants was readily detected. In contrast, no binding was evidenced on mock transfected cells (Figure 4) . Addition of either an N-acetylgalactosamine or a galactose residue onto H structures generates A or B antigens, respectively, and this is known to hinder recognition by anti-H reagents. 36 To get further insight into the specificity of NV capsids, both CHO and TS/A cells were doubly transfected with the FTB and rat A enzyme cDNAs. As expected, the double transfectants expressed the A antigen whereas their recognition by either the anti-H type 2 or the anti-H types 3 and 4 mAbs was severely diminished.

This is confirmed by the internalization that occurs after binding to FTB-transfected, but not -nontransfected, CHO cells. It is suggested that the expression of the carbohydrate ligand on the cell surface is required for internalization of the virus particles.

In addition, they were kept in culture for a longer period of time after confluency with frequent changes of medium. These different culture conditions could affect the differentiation of the cells.

Yet, if this was the case, the fact that NV particles attach only to the gut of secretor individuals suggests that only these people can be infected by the virus. In contrast, nonsecretor individuals are not expected to be infected because they lack the histo-blood group H oligosaccharides on the digestive epithelial cells. Most interestingly, it has been observed in studies performed on volunteers challenged with NV that nearly 20% of the subjects did not develop clinical signs of the disease or antibodies to the virus. 43 This frequency matches that of the nonsecretors in the general European or North American populations, suggesting that the polymorphism at the FUT2 locus could indeed be a major genetic determinant for sensitivity to NV. Among the remaining 80% volunteers, a significant proportion developed antibodies but no clinical signs, indicating that additional factors may be responsible for resistance to the infection. Our observation that the presence of the A histo-blood group antigenic motif hinders the binding site of rNV VLPs suggests that the polymorphisms at the ABO locus could also play a part in determining sensitivity to the virus.
