Although additional research on the relationship between habitat degradation and EIDs is needed, Gottdenker et al. ( 2014 ) reviewed 305 studies incorporating a broad variety of diseases and found that the most common land use change types related to zoonotic disease transmission were deforestation, habitat fragmentation, agricultural development, irrigation, and urbanization. Functionally, the mechanisms infl uencing disease spillover include disruption of food web structures, changes in host-pathogen interactions, and mixing of pathogen gene pools resulting in increased pathogen genetic diversity (Jones et al. 2013 ) . Many studies have shown that habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss correspond to an increase in disease and pathogen abundance and diversity within a host species (Allan et al. 2003 ; Gillespie et al. 2005 ; Keesing et al. 2006 ; Salzer et al. 2007 ; Cottontail et al. 2009 ; Young et al. 2014 ) . Specifi cally, the emergence or re-emergence of many zoonotic diseases including yellow fever, Lyme disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Nipah virus encephalitis, infl uenza, rabies, malaria, and human African trypanosomiasis have been linked to anthropogenic habitat changes (Jones et al. 2013 ) .",

Pathogen spillover from bushmeat can occur through consumption; however, the main risks are associated with exposure to body fl uids and feces during handling and butchering (Kilonzo et al. 2014 ; Paige et al. 2014 ) . Historically, when a spillover occurred, the likelihood of an epidemic was limited because hunter-gatherer tribes were generally small and widely dispersed, hampering disease transmission between groups of people. Once agricultural expansion occurred, human population densities increased, and people became better connected, diseases could spread more easily. As a result, transmissions of infectious diseases from animals to humans have led to devastating outcomes across the globe (LeBreton et al. 2006 ) . EIDs cause hundreds of thousands of deaths annually (Bogich et al. 2012 ) . Some outbreaks have spread across large regions and became pandemics, costing the global economy tens of billions of dollars (e.g., SARS, H5N1, the 2014-2015 West African Ebola outbreak) and bringing entire nations to the brink of economic collapse.",

            "text": "The term \"bushmeat\" refers to the meat derived from wild animals for human consumption (Milner-Gulland and Bennett 2003 ) ( Fig. 24.1 ). It includes a wide range of animals, such as invertebrates, amphibians, insects, fi sh, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including as many as 500 species in sub-Saharan Africa (Ape Alliance 2006 ). Although research has focused largely on mammals and, to a lesser extent, birds, theoretically any wildlife species harvested for bushmeat could be a potential source of zoonotic disease that can spillover during the hunting, butchering, and preparation process (Wolfe et al. 2000 ; Karesh and Noble 2009 ) . Hunters face risk of injury from live animals, which might allow animal blood to enter the hunter's bloodstream through open wounds. While small animals can be carried in bags, large animals are commonly carried on the shoulder or back, bringing the hunter in close contact with the animal and facilitating transfer of body fl uids (LeBreton et al. 2006 ) . The highest risk of disease transmission occurs during the butchering of animals, e.g. skinning, opening of the body cavity, removal of organs, and cutting of meat. More people butcher than hunt animals (83 % and 42 %, respectively, LeBreton et al. 2006 ) and butchering involves the use of sharp tools, which may lead to cuts during the process. Subramanian ( 2012 ) found that 38 % of respondents cut themselves on a regular basis during butchering. Women are especially at risk of disease transmission as they engage more often in butchering and in food preparation than men. In discussing the links between bushmeat and disease, we refer to this all-encompassing suite of risky behaviors as \"bushmeat-related activities.\"",

A review of the West and Central African bushmeat literature including market, offtake, and consumption surveys documented a total of 177 species from 25 orders that were harvested for bushmeat, including 134 (76 %) mammal species, 24 (14 %) bird species, 18 (10 %) reptile species, and 1 (<1 %) amphibian species (Taylor et al. 2015 ) . Among mammals, the largest group was primates (48 species) including western gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla ), bonobos ( Pan paniscus ), and common chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ), followed by ungulates (34 species), carnivores (22 species), and rodents (16 species). In terms of biomass offtake, however, ungulates are generally the most prominent group. Although the Taylor et al. ( 2015 ) study is very comprehensive, it only included studies that: (1) provided a quantitative measure of bushmeat offtake, consumption, and/or market availability/sales; (2) used non-biased data collection methods and systematically sampled settlements/hunters to prevent selection bias; (3) identifi ed carcasses to the species level; and (4) recorded either the number of carcasses or the total biomass (kg). For a more inclusive and general review of existing Central African bushmeat studies, see Wilkie and Carpenter ( 1999 ) , and for West African studies, see Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen ( 2011 ). Fa et al. ( 2006 ) found that of the approximately one million carcasses traded in the Cross-Sanaga region of Nigeria and Cameroon, 99 % were mammals; of which around 40 % were ungulates, 30 % rodents, and nearly 15 % primates. However, as wildlife populations become depleted, such as near urban areas and intensively used agricultural landscapes, smaller bodied mammals comprise a larger share of hunters' offtake (Bowen-Jones et al. 2003 ; Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al. 2013a ).

Bushmeat is an important source of animal protein in many West and Central African countries, with up to 90 % of total animal protein consumption coming from wild animals (Fa et al. 2003 ) . Overall, the contribution of bushmeat to protein and food security is generally lower in urban than rural areas and is highest among remote rural communities . For example, the relative importance of bushmeat in the diet of rural Gabonese households ranged from 13 % of total household consumption value in a village near a town to 25 % in a remote community (Starkey 2004 ) . Similarly, for rural Equatorial Guinea, Allebone-Webb ( 2008 ) showed that bushmeat consumption contributed 43 % to total protein consumption in a village with poor transport links, but only 18 % in a village with good connections. In remote Cameroonian communities with very few opportunities for purchasing alternative protein sources, bushmeat comprised 80-98 % of animal protein consumption (Muchaal and Ngandjui 1999 ) . In rural communities with relatively good market access and low levels of bushmeat consumption, the importance of bushmeat for food has been shown to increase seasonally during the agricultural lean season (e.g. the planting season between harvests) when farming households receive little income (Dei 1989 , de Merode et al. 2004 , Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al. 2013b ) and during the dry season when fi sh is not available (Poulsen et al. 2009 ). Bushmeat is also an important source of nutrients, especially among children. Evidence from rural Madagascar shows that removing bushmeat consumption would result in a 29 % increase in the number of children suffering from anemia and triple the cases of anemia among children in the poorest households Most hunters sell at least part of their harvest making it an important source of income, especially where alternative income-generating activities are lacking. The importance of bushmeat in household economies varies across sites and individual hunting households, ranging from 38 % to more than 90 % of the total cash income earned (reviewed in Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen 2011 ). In rural Gabon, hunting accounts for up to 72 % of household incomes, with the proportion rising in poorer, more remote communities (Starkey 2004 ) . Hunters are also more likely to sell large animals and keep small animals for their own consumption, because the latter fetch a lower price per animal and may be less marketable (van Vliet and Nasi 2008 ) . Finally, households facing income shortages during the agricultural lean season and requiring cash income to pay for urgent expenditures, such as hospital bills, are more likely to sell bushmeat than keep it for own consumption (de Merode et al. 2004 ) .",

In the past, novel pathogens entering the rural communities may not have spread beyond the community, but this is no longer the case as remote rural areas are connected to urban areas, and increased global trade networks and air travel increases the risk of disease transmission worldwide . This expanding trade network links hunters to consumers, and with many people along this commodity chain coming into contact with bushmeat, the opportunity for disease spillover can occur at many points. For example, the commodity chain supplying bushmeat to an urban market in Ghana includes hunters, wholesalers, market traders, restaurant owners, and consumers (Mendelson et al. 2003 ) . The bushmeat commodity chain supplying an urban market in Democratic Republic of the Congo is comprised of hunters, porters who carry the meat to the road, the bicycle traders who transport the meat into town, and the market-stall owners who sell the bushmeat to consumers (de Merode and Cowlishaw 2006 ) . A recent study from Ghana estimates that a minimum of 128,000 bats are sold each year through a commodity chain that stretches up to 400 km and involves multiple vendors (Kamins et al. 2011a ) . In Zambia, Mozambique, and Malawi, well-developed and complex rural-urban trade supply networks link rural hunters to urban consumers who are willing to pay high prices for bushmeat (Barnett 1997 ) . Understanding commodity chains is important, as pathogens likely remain viable for some period after an animal is killed. For example, Prescott et al. ( 2015 ) demonstrated that Ebola virus remains viable on monkey carcasses for at least seven days, with viral RNA detectable for 10 weeks.",

Despite substantial effort in recent years, our knowledge is still site-specifi c and data are lacking from many regions. Most surveys have been restricted to relatively small areas or market catchments from which national estimates were extrapolated. Research efforts have focused on Central Africa with some data available for 60 % of countries compared to 30 % of West African countries (Taylor et al. 2015 ) . A large number of sites with detailed bushmeat data are concentrated in the Cross-Sanaga region of Nigeria and Cameroon, where Fa et al. ( 2006 ) collected market data at 86 sites, hence presenting a geographical bias in our understanding of bushmeat harvest . Furthermore, the majority of available data samples (79.3 % and 53.6 %, in West and Central Africa, respectively) identifi ed by Taylor et al. ( 2015 ) come from market surveys with poorly defi ned catchment areas, compared to offtake and consumption surveys. Strong variation between individual estimates highlights the problems with extrapolation of survey data to national or regional levels and the effects of sampling strategies (hunter versus market surveys), timing of survey (open season versus lean season), survey location, and extrapolation methods. Individual fi gures should therefore be treated with caution, but the overall message remains: bushmeat is harvested at an enormous scale exposing those involved in the bushmeat commodity chain to zoonotic diseases.",

For example, after the construction of 140 km of logging roads in northern Congo, the average time for a hunting trip was reduced from 12 to 2 hours (Wilkie et al. 2001 ) . Development of rural businesses , such as timber companies, attracts workers and their families to remote locations, increasing bushmeat demand, especially when no hunting regulations are in place and alternative protein sources are not provided Bennett and Gumal 2001 ; Poulsen et al. 2009 ). The effect of logging company presence on hunting pressure was documented in Gabon where ape populations decreased 50 % between 1983 and 2000 as a result of hunting (Walsh et al. 2003 ). In addition, agricultural expansion and mining have exerted a strong force in changing the African landscape and infl uencing human migration patterns (Norris et al. 2010 ).

Illegal wildlife trade is the second-largest black market worldwide, involving millions of animals and estimated to be worth US$50-150 billion per year (United Nations Environment Programme 2014 ). Case studies at airports screening passenger luggage for bushmeat estimated that approximately 5 tons of bushmeat per week arrive at Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport (Chaber et al. 2010 ) and 8.6 tons per year at Zurich and Geneva airports (Falk et al. 2013 ) . As bushmeat hunting, globalization, and human interconnectedness increase, the potential for zoonoses leading to EIDs also increases. This risk was highlighted when retroviruses (e.g., simian foamy virus) and herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus and lymphocryptovirus) were found in confi scated primates at US airports (Smith et al. 2012 ).",

For instance, nonhuman primates of the family Hominidae include the Gorillinae and Paninae, which show a genetic difference of only 2 % or less with humans (Gonzalez et al. 2013 ) , and members of these subfamilies share many morphological, physiological, and ecological features that may have a direct role in the transmission of infectious diseases (Davies and Pedersen 2008 ) . Cleaveland et al. ( 2007 ) , in their assessment of the risk of disease emergence by taxa, found that the relative risk of disease emergence was highest for bats, followed closely by primates, then ungulates and rodents. There have been surprisingly few studies of the connection between hunting of birds or other vertebrates and EIDs, especially in Africa, but surveillance for zoonotic pathogens in African birds is strongly needed (e.g., for avian infl uenza tracking see Simulundu et al. 2011 Simulundu et al. , 2014 .",

Taste preferences for certain species infl uence hunters' decisions as do attempts to maximize returns by preferring large-bodied animals that provide more food or fetch a higher price when sold than small-bodied species (Bodmer 1995 ) . Bats, especially the larger fruit bats popular in the bushmeat trade, are susceptible to hunting because they are often found in large, sometimes vocal groups that are visible during the day or in high concentrations in caves (Mickleburgh et al. 2009 ). Increased human encroachment in recent decades (Kamins et al. 2011b ) has driven some bat species to become peridomestic (O'Shea et al. 2011 ; Plowright et al. 2011 ) , which renders them easy targets for hunting. Finally, sick animals may be less successful in evading hunters and hence more easily hunted, thereby increasing the risk of disease transmission to hunters.",

From this, it follows that emerging pathogens are not an arbitrary selection of all pathogens. Becoming established in a human host typically requires adaptations, often for increased virulence, as has been documented in HIV (Wain et al. 2007 ; Etienne et al. 2013 ) . Generalist pathogens have the ability to infect more than one host species and have higher relative emergence risk than pathogens that are very hostspecifi c (Cleaveland et al. 2007 ); this is especially true for pathogens that can infect species in more than one taxonomic order. One example of this generalist \"broad\" host range is found in the newly described African henipavirus, which can enter and infect cells of nonhuman primates, bats, and humans (Lawrence et al. 2014 ) .",

            "text": "Of particular importance for understanding bushmeat-related spillover events is whether a wildlife species is a natural or incidental pathogen host. Natural or reservoir hosts are a natural part of the pathogen life cycle and may maintain the infectious pathogen for prolonged periods of time, often without showing symptoms. In contrast, an incidental or dead-end host may be infected by the pathogen and may even transmit it, but it is not a part of the normal maintenance cycle of the pathogen and is more likely to be affected by it than natural hosts. For example, contact with sick common chimpanzees and western gorillas has been tightly linked to Ebola virus spillover in several outbreaks (Leroy et al. 2004b ) . Like their human cousins, these great apes are largely considered incidental or dead-end hosts for this virus and do not maintain it long-term in nature. In the case of this deadly fi lovirus, understanding what species are true reservoirs (likely fruit bats in the family Pteropodidae; Pourrut et al. 2007 Pourrut et al. , 2009 Hayman et al. 2010 Hayman et al. , 2012 and the spillover events between these reservoirs and other mammals (including apes, carnivores, and ungulates; Leroy et al. 2004a ) will prove critical to mitigating the components of disease transmission that are due to bushmeat-related activities. Unfortunately, it is often diffi cult to defi nitively determine the natural host(s) of a particular pathogen as it requires, in descending order of importance, isolation of the agent from individuals of the target species, detection of pathogen-specifi c nucleic acid sequences from individuals, and serological evidence that an individual has been exposed previously. Indeed, the study of reservoir systems and how infectious agents move between and within them can be complex, requiring rigorous and sophisticated analyses of multiple interrelated variables (Gray and Salemi 2012 ; Viana et al. 2014 ) .",

In their review of global trends in EIDs, in which they separately listed each antimicrobial pathogen strain that has recently emerged, Jones et al. ( 2008 ) report that the vast majority of pathogens involved in EIDs are bacterial or rickettsial, followed by viral or prion, then protozoa, fungi, and helminths. Other studies have ranked viruses as more prevalent (Taylor et al. 2001 ; Woolhouse et al. 2005 ; Cleaveland et al. 2007 ). In Jones et al.'s ( 2008 ) analysis of 335 EID events between 1940 and 2004, only four EIDs list bushmeat as the driver; other signifi cant drivers were socioeconomic factors such as human population density. These four bushmeat-related EID events were all signifi cant events; all due to viruses (Ebolavirus, human immunodefi ciency virus-1, monkeypox virus, and SARS), suggesting that viruses are the most important pathogens in regard to spillover due to bushmeat-related activities (see also Kilonzo et al. 2014 ) . We review the literature from sub-Saharan Africa in relation to bushmeat species by pathogen type (viruses, bacteria, helminths, protozoa, fungi, and prions), noting the signifi cant potential for pathogens not yet associated with bushmeat-related activities to also be involved. Very few studies have considered all of the potential zoonotics in a region or in a taxonomic group. Magwedere et al.'s ( 2011 ) comprehensive study of zoonotics in Namibia is an exception. Table 24 .1 summarizes these pathogens by bushmeat host taxonomic group, conservatively listing only those species/pathogen combinations that have been tied strongly to spillovers from wildlife to humans via bushmeat-related activities and recognizing that this link is often putative and diffi cult to establish. Thus, Table 24 .1 does not include some of the potential but not demonstrated spillover risks of poorly studied groups such as helminths and protozoans. Furthermore, due to their close genetic relationship with humans, common chimpanzees and western gorillas may share many pathogens of all varieties with humans, but the direction of spillover is not always clear (e.g. tourist interactions may spread disease from humans to apes) and much of these data are not discussed herein. Also not included in the table are studies where pathogens are not determined to species and, consequently, the bushmeat host-human link is unclear, or where exposure would be via an insect vector, which could be encountered when handling bushmeat. While we have attempted a very thorough treatment of pathogens that meet our criteria for inclusion in the table, it is possible that some relevant studies have been missed. ",

            "text": "Viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites characterized primarily by the nature of their nucleic acids (DNA or RNA; single or double stranded, etc.). They are the most abundant form of life on earth; many viruses are recognized as important disease-causing agents, and they are subject to frequent mutation and thus evolution. The advent of modern molecular techniques has advanced our understanding of viral diversity and pathogenesis in both animal and human hosts. For example, in relation to bushmeat, it is now clear that many virus variants are present in hunted nonhuman primate species, which have received most of the research attention, and that these variants have crossed between nonhuman primates and humans on multiple occasions (Peeters and Delaporte 2012 ; Table 24 .1 ). Bats and rodents are also major zoonotic virus carriers (Meerburg et al. 2009 ; Baker et al. 2013 ); other taxonomic groups are less studied, at least in sub-Saharan Africa. Several sub-Saharan African viruses of importance are vector-borne, including Rift Valley Fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. While one presumes that this would make them unlikely to spread via bushmeat-related activities, the possibility remains that animal handling could present a risk (Magwedere et al. 2012 ). However, no signifi cant links between vector-borne viruses and bushmeat hunting have been made, and we will not include a discussion of these viruses here. . Evidence suggests that SIV crossed over to humans by blood contact when hunters had an exposed open wound or injured themselves during the butchering of nonhuman primates (Hahn et al. 2000 ; Wolfe et al. 2004a , b ; Karesh and Noble 2009 ) . The closest relatives of HIV-1 found among nonhuman primates are SIVcpz and SIVgor, from common chimpanzees and western gorillas in west central Africa (Gao et al. 1999 ; Sharp et al. 2005 ; Keele et al. 2006 ; Van Heuverswyn et al. 2006 , 2007 Takehisa et al. 2009 ) and at least four separate spillovers have occurred (Peeters et al. 2013 The potential for future and continued spillovers from SIVs is high, and multiple species-specifi c variants exist. For example, Peeters et al. ( 2002 ) and Peeters ( 2004 ) estimated that more than 20 % of nonhuman primates hunted for food are infected with a variant of SIV; Locatelli and Peeters ( 2012 ) and Peeters et al. ( 2013 ) noted that at least 45 species-specifi c variants of SIV from at least 45 primate species are currently recognized. Aghokeng et al. ( 2010 ) sampled 1856 nonhuman primate carcasses from 11 species found in bushmeat markets in Cameroon. They documented low overall prevalence of SIV (only 2.93 % of carcasses), with the lowest prevalence found among the most common species in the market. However, they did fi nd SIV variants in about 70 % of the tested primate species. In total, serological evidence of SIV infection has been documented for at least 40 different primate species (Aghokeng et al. 2010 ; Li\u00e9geois et al. 2011 Li\u00e9geois et al. , 2012 . Cross-species transmission of strains and co-infection with more than one strain have been documented, sometimes followed by genetic recombination (Hahn et al. 2000 ; Bibollet-Ruche et al. 2004 ; Aghokeng et al. 2007 ; Gogarten et al. 2014 ), a recipe for future spillovers into humans (Locatelli and Peeters 2012 ) .",

These pathogens are periodically emerging viruses, typically from single spillover events, which cause hemorrhagic fevers (reviewed by Olival and Hayman 2014 ; Rougeron et al. 2015 (but note that Rougeron's listing for a single case of SUDV in Sudan in 2011 is erroneous)). The 2014-2015 West Africa outbreak of EBOV is still ongoing at the time of this writing (Labouba and Leroy 2015 ) . While the zoonotic source of this outbreak is unknown, three initial outbreaks of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1976 to 1979 involved victims who were reported to have handled western gorilla or common chimpanzee carcasses or to have had physical contact with people who touched the animals (Leroy et al. 2004a , b ) . Similarly, Marburgvirus was fi rst identifi ed in laboratory workers who had dissected imported grivet ( Chlorocebus aethiops ) (Martini et al. 1968 ; Siegert et al. 1968 ). Both western gorillas and common chimpanzees have suffered signifi cant mortality from fi lovirus outbreaks (Walsh et al. 2003 ; Leroy et al. 2004a , b ; Bermejo et al. 2006 ; Rizkalla et al. 2007 ) and antibodies to EBOV were documented in several other primate species by Leroy et al. ( 2004b ) . The single case of TAFV occurred in an ethnologist likely infected while performing a necropsy of a dead common chimpanzee following a rash of common chimpanzee deaths in the Tai National Park in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Le Guenno et al. 1995 ; Wyers et al. 1999 ) . Beyond primates, other incidental hosts in the wild are possible, as was demonstrated for duikers ( Cephalophus spp.) (Leroy et al. 2004a ; Rouquet et al. 2005 ) . As reviewed by Weingartl et al. ( 2013 ) , both dogs (naturally) and pigs (at least experimentally) can also be infected. During the 2001-2002 EBOV outbreak in Gabon, Allela et al. ( 2005 ) found over 30 % seroprevalence in dogs living in villages with EBOV human and animal cases. Those dogs appeared to be asymptomatic and were presumed to be exposed by scavenging wild animals.",

            "text": "Although incidental hosts likely play important roles in the ecology of these viruses, especially when moribund or dead animals are consumed, strong evidence suggests that bats are the natural reservoir hosts for at least Marburgvirus and EBOV. For Marburgvirus, the cave dwelling and densely packed Egyptian rousette fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) is now well-documented as a reservoir host Amman et al. 2012 ), but antibodies against the virus and/or the presence of viral RNA have been found in several other species (see Table 24 .1 ). The strong association of Marburgvirus with the Egyptian rousette makes sense in light of the outbreaks of this virus in people visiting tourist caves or working in mines (Adjemian et al. 2011 ; Timen et al. 2009 ; Towner et al. 2009 ; Amman et al. 2012 ). The picture for EBOV is less clear, but evidence of infection has been found in at least eight sub-Saharan bat species (Pourrut et al. , 2009 Hayman et al. 2010 Hayman et al. , 2012 Table 24 .1 ). Of the ten bat species listed in Table 24 .1 for Marburgvirus and EBOV, seven are fruit bats, which are relatively larger and more visible, and thus targets of bushmeat hunters. That said, bushmeat hunting of these bats is not ubiquitous throughout their range and cannot solely explain fi lovirus spillovers. Mari Sa\u00e9z et al. ( 2015 ) unconvincingly suggested the non-fruit bat, Mops condylurus, might have been the source of the 2014-2015 West African Ebola outbreak. Pourrut et al. ( 2009 ) found evidence of antibodies against ZEBOV in this species, but there is no real evidence that this free-tailed bat played a role in the 2014-2015 outbreak. To date, no bat host has been identifi ed for BDBV, SUDV, or TAFV and broader surveillance for indications of these viruses in bats and other hosts should be conducted.",

However, recent studies have identifi ed Henipavirus and Henipa-like viruses in sub-Saharan African fruit bats, which are a phylogenetically distinct clade of pteropodid bats that do not overlap distributionally with any Pteropus species. Documentation of Henipavirus and related RNA (Drexler et al. 2009 ; Muleya et al. 2014 ; Baker et al. 2012 ) and anti-Henipavirus antibodies (Hayman et al. 2008 ; Pernet et al. 2014 ) in the African straw-colored fruit bat ( Eidolon helvum ) clearly show that this deadly and diverse viral group is present in sub-Saharan Africa. This bat species is a frequent target of hunters and a signifi cant protein source where it is found (Kamins et al. 2011b ). Weiss et al. ( 2012 ) documented the presence of this group of viruses in these bats found live in bushmeat markets. Strong evidence of spillover to humans was documented by Pernet et al. ( 2014 ) who found antibodies against HNVs in human samples from Cameroon. These seropositive human samples were found almost exclusively in individuals who reported butchering these bats. This bat is also a long-distance migrator with signifi cant panmixia across the continent, which could facilitate viral transmission between bats (Peel et al. 2013 ) .",

A precautionary tale from sub-Saharan Africa comes from the recent discovery and naming of the Sosuga virus from a wildlife researcher who became very ill after handling and dissecting hundreds of bats and rodents in Uganda and South Sudan (Albari\u00f1o et al. 2014 ). This virus is most closely related to Tuhoko virus 3, a rubulalike virus recently isolated from the Leschenault's Rousette fruit bat ( Rousettus leschenaultii ) in southern China. Amman et al. ( 2015 ) subsequently found Sosuga virus in R. aegyptiacus captured from multiple locations in Uganda; the researcher infected by this virus handled this species extensively in her studies.",

An estimated 25,000 people die in Africa each year from rabies (Dodet et al. 2015 ) , some portion of which may be from exposure that occurs in bushmeat-related activities, although most human cases can be attributed to domestic dogs. Rabies virus (RABV) is in the Lyssavirus genus. It is joined in Africa by at least fi ve additional species: Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), Shimoni bat virus (SHIBV), and the newly proposed Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV). These viruses have bat(s) as their reservoir host ) with two exceptions. The Mokola virus is found in shrews ( Crocidura spp.), rusty-bellied brush-furred rat ( Lophuromys sikapusi ; Saluzzo et al. 1984 ) , and companion animals (Delmas et al. 2008 ; Kgaladi et al. 2013 ). The Ikoma virus has thus far only been documented in African civets ( Civettictis civetta ; Table 24 .1 , Marston et al. 2012 ) . A variety of wildlife species can be secondary hosts of rabies (e.g., in Botswana, see Moagabo et al. 2009 ) and rabies has been documented to occur in a number of nonhuman primate species, including those encountered in the bushmeat trade (Gautret et al. 2014 ) . Lyssaviruses are found worldwide, but the greatest genetic diversity is in Africa and Lagos bat virus may be more than one species (Delmas et al. 2008 ; Markotter et al. 2008 ; Kuzmin et al. 2010a ) . While most human cases are due to rabies virus, Duvenhage virus has been documented in human fatalities associated with bat scratches that likely transmitted the virus (van Thiel et al. 2009 ; Paweska et al. 2006 ) . Mokolo virus has been detected in two human cases without mortality (Kgaladi et al. 2013 ) .",

The true diversity of lyssaviruses in Africa, and the potential for human spillover via bushmeat-related activities, remains to be discovered.",

As with some of the bacterial pathogens described below, the primary risk comes from peridomestic exposure to the rodent host, the natal mastomys ( Mastomys natalensis ), via exposure to urine or fecal materials. However, Ter Meulen et al.

            "text": "Human Monkeypox Virus : Contrary to its moniker, the reservoir hosts of human monkeypox virus (MPX) are neither monkeys nor humans, but rather rodents. The fi rst case of human monkeypox was identifi ed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with subsequent outbreaks in Liberia, Sierra Leone, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (reviewed by Reynolds et al. 2010 ; Rimoin et al. 2010 ) . Recent MPX increases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere have been attributed to cessation of the human smallpox vaccine, which conferred some immunity to other pox viruses . Human and nonhuman primate infections are suspected to result from wildlife exposure such as would occur in bushmeat-related activities; infected species include squirrels (e.g., Thomas's rope squirrel, Funisciurus anerythrus ; Khodakevich et al. 1986 ; African ground squirrels; Xerus sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010 ) , dormice ( Graphiurus sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010 ) , and giant pouched rats ( Cricetomys sp.; Reynolds et al. 2010 ) . The outbreak that occurred in the USA in 2007 after exposure to rodents in the illegal pet trade also linked human monkeypox to rope squirrels, dormice, and pouched rats (Hutson et al. 2007 ). While dormice are small and not likely to be the target of hunting, the diurnal and highly visible squirrels and the giant pouched rats are routinely hunted (Taylor et al. 2015 ) , making the spillover to humans highly plausible. Jones et al. ( 2008 ) list 54.3 % of EID events as being caused by bacteria and there is good evidence to suggest that bacterial pathogens have the potential to be just as important as viruses when it comes to those that may spillover due to bushmeat-related activities, but in this capacity they have received far less attention (Cantas and Suer 2014 ) . Transmission pathways for bacterial pathogens can occur through direct exposure to body fl uids or feces, but they can also possibly be transferred indirectly through exposure to disease vectors such as fl eas and ticks when handling animals. In a rare survey of bacterial pathogens that might spillover via bushmeat-related activities, Bachand et al. ( 2012 ) sampled muscle from 128 bushmeat carcasses from multiple species at markets in Gabon for the presence of Campylobacter , Salmonella , and Shigella . While they only recorded the presence of Salmonella , the potential for contamination and thus spillover of enteric pathogens from carcass handling remains high, especially in the days after purchase when pathogens continue to replicate. Bacteria in the genus Leptospira are endemic sub-Saharan African pathogens that have a high risk of spillover during bushmeatrelated activities as they are shed in urine. Jobbins and Alexander ( 2015 ) documented their widespread presence in wild mammals, birds, and reptiles, highlighting the role that wildlife may play in leptospirosis. The bushmeat interface may also play a role in human cases of anthrax, caused by Bacillis anthracis , which is largely a disease of grazing herbivorous mammals, but to which common chimpanzees are also susceptible (Leendertz et al. 2004 ). If bushmeat includes not only the hunting of apparently healthy animals but also sick animals or salvage of contaminated carcasses, the risk of human outbreaks increases (Hang'ombe et al. 2012 ) .",

The risk of protozoan spillover from bushmeat-related activities is similar to that for helminths and bacteria in that exposure to feces, bodily fl uids, and even potentially to meat could transmit disease to a permissive human host (Pourrut et al. 2011 ) . A number of protozoans are important pathogens with zoonotic potential (Taylor et al. 2001 ). Perhaps the best example are the amoebozoa, which cause diarrheal disease and which are documented in a variety of animals, including bushmeat species such as nonhuman primates (Gillespie et al. 2010 ; Pourrut et al. 2011 ) . Gillespie et al. ( 2010 ) documented the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica and the ciliated protozoan Balantidium coli in common chimpanzees; both are human pathogens (although the direction of spillover is uncertain, as common chimpanzees and other primates may have obtained this parasite from humans). Indeed, Lilly et al. ( 2002 ) documented both protozoans in common chimpanzees, western gorillas, agile mangabeys, and humans living in the same region in Central African Republic. A number of other nonhuman primates have had documented E. histolytica infections as well (see Table 24 .1 ). Other protozoan examples include Toxoplasma gondii , which causes the disease toxoplasmosis, but could not be detected during a recent, albeit small scale, survey of bushmeat (Prang\u00e9 et al. 2009 ) and water/foodborne parasites such as Giardia. Recent studies have documented Giardia in a variety of species that exist in the bushmeat trade, including western gorilla and African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer ) (Hogan et al. 2014 ).",

Whether hunters take precautions may depend on their knowledge and perception of disease risk. There is increasing evidence that the perception of and knowledge about zoonotic diseases is generally low but varies strongly between sites. A survey among rural bushmeat hunters and traders in Sierra Leone showed that 24 % reported knowledge of disease transmission from animals to humans (Subramanian 2012 ) . Similarly, 23 % of rural-urban hunters and traders in Ghana perceived a disease risk from a bat-bushmeat activity, with signifi cantly more respondents associating risk with bat consumption than bat preparation or hunting (Kamins et al. 2014 ) . Individuals who participate in butchering wild animals typically associate less risk to meat preparation and consumption than those who do not participate in butchering (Kamins et al. 2014 ) (Fig. 24.2 ) . LeBreton et al. ( 2006 ) found that hunters and butchers who perceived personal risks were signifi cantly less likely to butcher wild animals, but that risk perception was not associated with hunting and eating bushmeat. Thirty-three percent of bushmeat consumers in a Ghanaian market were not aware that zoonotic diseases could be transmitted from bushmeat to humans. Those who were aware gave Ebola (48 %) and anthrax (16 %) as examples of zoonotic diseases (Kuukyi et al. 2014 ). In contrast, a large-scale survey among rural Central African population showed that the majority (74 %) of respondents perceived contact with bushmeat blood or body fl uids as dangerous (LeBreton et al. 2006 ) . Unfortunately, studies in this fi eld can be challenging, as reported perceptions may differ from actual or 'revealed' behaviors and beliefs (Wilkie 2006 ) .",

LeBreton et al. ( 2006 ) found that only 4 % of hunters and 2 % of people reporting butchering indicated that they took precautions against contact with animal blood and fl uids while hunting and butchering. Furthermore, the few that took precautions may not have protected themselves adequately, as the most common response was \"generally being careful.\" This was followed by \"washing hands,\" and the least number of participants reporting \"avoiding contact with blood, draining blood from carcasses and wearing suitable clothing.\" Paige et al. ( 2014 ) examined human-animal interactions in western Uganda and found that nearly 20 % of participants reported either being injured by an animal or having contact with a primate. The most commonly reported animal injuries were bites (72.9 %) and scratches (23.2 %). In a separate study, it was also shown that although Ghanaian hunters generally handle live bats, they do not typically use protective measures such as gloves, and thereby come into contact with blood through scratches and bites (Kamins et al. 2014 ) . Given the lack of awareness and precautionary measures taken among people who come into contact with bushmeat, the opportunity for new zoonotic pathogens to spillover into humans remains high (LeBreton et al. 2006 ) . This is especially true, since the current rate of hunting wild animals will likely continue-at least until domestic animal production increases and can support the protein needs of the local people.",

This retroactive response to emerging disease outbreaks is often costly economically and in terms of human well-being (Childs and Gordon 2009 ; United Nations Development Program 2015 ) . Increased pre-spillover surveillance measures along with quantifi cation of spillover risk is critically needed. For example, Wolfe et al. ( 2004b Wolfe et al. ( , 2005b found that 1 % of rural Cameroonians are infected with wild primate variants of T-lymphotropic viruses and another 1 % are infected with wild primate variants of simian foamy virus. These sorts of data are simply lacking for most emergent disease systems. Here we will discuss the regulatory and educational measures that could be taken to mitigate the risk of a zoonotic spillover event and spread. Such efforts should be undertaken as a part of a comprehensive response to other sub-Saharan public health crises so as to not divert scarce resources. For example, increases in EID surveillance efforts and in post-emergence management go hand in hand with the improved healthcare infrastructure that must become a priority for sub-Saharan Africa.",

A more practical option may be to restrict hunting of nonhuman primates, as many zoonotic EIDs have come from them, and instead allow communities to hunt smaller-bodied mammals with higher reproductive rates. Any intervention aiming to restrict access to wildlife should involve community leaders and stakeholders during public outreach to reduce the risk of alienating communities (Monroe and Willcox 2006 ) . The education and enforcement necessary to implement such a restriction must consider the cultural and economic contexts surrounding individual communities. Consider, for example, the problems with enforcement of access restrictions and the history of antagonistic relationships due to exclusion from protected areas between conservationists and local communities. Without proper educational outreach, this could result in backlash from local communities. Furthermore, using zoonotic diseases to enforce hunting restrictions runs the risk of demonizing species considered to be the main disease carriers. Nonhuman primates could then become targets and their populations could be decimated (Pooley et al. 2015 ) .",

Communicating with hunters and butchers about the risks associated with bushmeat and promoting awareness of safer techniques may reduce current levels of pathogen exposure and transmission. To enhance the effectiveness of prevention campaigns, it is particularly important to reinforce the potential for infections during hunting and butchering as this may be overlooked by some hunters (LeBreton et al. 2006 ) . Because the risk perception of hunters and those engaging in butchering wild animals has a negative association with the level of participation in meat preparation and consumption (Kamins et al. 2014 ) , this may reduce current levels of pathogen exposure and transmission, if not by discouraging individuals to participate in preparation and consumption, then by encouraging those individuals to more proactively consider safety and preventative measures.",

Some authors have even found that when people do believe the risk is real and relevant, there is often little evidence that this knowledge promotes a change in behavior (McCaffrey 2004 ) . For example, a pilot education program among Ghanaian hunters resulted in substantially improved understanding of disease risk, yet largely failed to change peoples' behavior (Kamins et al. 2014 ) . When asked about what would change their behavior, participants responded; becoming ill from zoonotic disease followed by alternative livelihoods and stricter laws. Because awareness is not directly related to behavior, Monroe and Willcox ( 2006 ) suggest that campaigns should not rely on the threat of infection to change behavior, but should rather use community leaders to change cultural norms associated with hunting and educate people involved in butchering about best practices of how to protect themselves.",

Improved detection and surveillance will lead to a better prioritization of public health efforts. One of the most effective strategies in terms of early detection of an emergent pathogenic threat would be to focus surveillance efforts among people who are highly exposed to at-risk animals and on the animal populations to which they are exposed (LeBreton et al. 2012 ) .

In order to track and provide data for EIDs, this effort coordinates the collection of fi lter-paper blood samples from both hunted animals and people who hunt and butcher wild animals. Early results have shown that this type of surveillance can assist in early detection of new diseases by offering insight into pathogen origin. It would also help describe the spillover dynamics of new or existing diseases. Such data are valuable for developing a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the processes that drive disease emergence and prevent spillovers from spreading in early stages of an outbreak. Contextualizing the relative or actual risks of spillovers would be vital for the preferential allocation of resources to high-risk regions or humans who perform high-risk activities (Daszak et al. 2007 ). As part of these efforts, improved knowledge of how anthropogenic environmental changes and sociological or demographic factors affect the risk of disease emergence will likely be a cost-effective and sustainable mechanism to reduce or control disease spillover risks (Daszak et al. 2007 ).",

Accordingly, the challenge should be addressed in a holistic manner, by integrating multiple efforts to achieve common objectives. Although much progress has been made not only in addressing the problems concerning bushmeat harvest and zoonotic disease spillover, there is much work to be done. Research that would pave the way for future efforts would include the quantifi cation of social response to environmental policy change (e.g., in the context of harvest restriction), development of a more representative picture of bushmeat consumption in Africa, a broader exploration of the many classes of pathogens within wildlife, and more thorough understanding and quantifi cation of the dynamics behind spillover events and the risks to humans. Such efforts could facilitate the development of policy and infrastructure that would help curb the dependency on bushmeat, reduce risks associated with bushmeat harvest, and help understand in what circumstances zoonotic disease spillover events occur.",

Such an effort might consist of surveying rural bushmeat-harvesting populations across Africa and using the resulting data to contextualize priorities and goals in a way that could help standardize education approaches. While some locations in Africa have had extensive research in the scope and impact of bushmeat harvest, much of Africa has been neglected in those efforts. A more developed understanding of the location, scale, and structure of bushmeat harvest throughout the continent would help researchers and policy-makers prioritize efforts related to disease surveillance, education, or aid. The study of zoonotic spillover events related to viruses, while not completely developed, has received far more attention than the related fi elds of spillover from bacterial or other non-virus pathogens. There is signifi cant interest in pursuing these lines, as they represent an underdeveloped body of knowledge that could have signifi cant impacts related to human health and disease ecology.",
