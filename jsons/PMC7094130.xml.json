            "text": "As a part of the Korean healthcare system's efforts to provide citizens with complete medical care, the system is also under pressure to lower medical costs. The Korean government has been trying to optimize patient room design by increasing numbers of \u201cmulti-patient rooms\u201d rather than \u201csingle-patient rooms\u201d, in order to minimize overall healthcare cost for its citizens, as announced at the 2015 Health Insurance Policy Review Committee Conference in Seoul. Consequently, the existing system neglects operational perspectives and raises concerns by allowing 50% of hospital rooms to have more than four beds per room (Ki, 2015). Under another global view, the Canadian Standards Association argued that expansion of single patient rooms is no longer an option but a necessary decision (Stall, 2012), highlighting the relationship between patient room design and increased hand-touch dimensions within specific, patient-proximal areas. Stall (2012) reported risks of infections (such as Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-reistant Enterococcus) increased by 10\u201311% with new exposure to hospital roommate. Therefore, noted that with an increasing deadly threat of nosocomial infections, rooms with four or more beds expose patients to potential infections and, thus, the installation of single patient rooms is vital. Thus, infection control activities have been emphasized, such as the isolation of high-risk patients or patient with epidemiologically significant pathogens (Huang and Platt, 2003, Marshall et al., 2004). Furthermore, Bootsma et al. (2006) developed rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) for prediction of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) to a below 1%, using Monte Carlo simulation model. While prevention of HAIs has been previously studied and applied elsewhere, its need for application in Korean policy remains unaddressed.",

However, the active family care has increased the risks of disease transmission, through frequent contacts with patients and hand-touch areas. Hand-touch sites are pathways to transmit pathogens from patient to patient, healthy visitors, caregivers, and/or hospital staff (Oelberg et al., 2000, Rheinbaben et al., 2000). Even though ward cleaners are given specific cleaning specifications of general areas and bathrooms, these do not cover all hand-touch sites that are specifically near patients, such as bed rails and nurse call buttons (Dancer, 2004, Dancer et al., 2008, White et al., 2008). Consequently, frequent hand-sites provide imminent risks for patients and visitors, especially the sites that are closely situated beside patients. Bhalla et al. (2004) performed a two-week experiment using organisms such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to examine the frequency of hand acquisition of pathogens, after contact with surfaces near patients, and found that \u201chand imprint cultures were positive for one or more of the pathogens after contacting surfaces in 53% of occupied patient rooms, and 24% of rooms that had been cleaned after patient discharge.\u201d Their research concluded that the environment could play a significant role in the contamination of medical staff. Korea, where families are obligated to provide partial patient caregiving as a social norm (Ki, 2015), is in dire need for social education in the negative influence of frequent visits, and excessive care of patients, leading to HAIs.",
