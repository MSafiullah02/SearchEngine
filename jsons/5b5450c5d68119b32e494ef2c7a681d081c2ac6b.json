The qualified library was sequenced as 100 bp paired-end reads on Ion Torrent platform (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. We found one frameshift mutation in exon 15 (c.1995 delT), one synonymous NSP in exon16 (c.2070 T>C) and three splicing in exon18 (NM_021804 TA>AG, NM_021804 CT>GG and NM_021804 CT>GG) and NM_021804:exon4:c.439+4G>A in ACE2 receptor. On the other hand, we found 9 SNPs in BACE2 receptor, which are 3 non synonymous SNP in exons 1, 3 and 8 (c.190 C>G, c.455 G>A and c.1156 A>T, respectively) 2 synonymous SNP in exons 1 and 7 (c.192 G>C and c.1092 C>T), one frameshift mutation in exon1 (c.216 delG) and exon4:c.619-5C>T, exon5:c.748-14->T and exon5:c.748-10C>T. All the SNP variants are common in world population and their structural damaging scores are not high enough to affect the protein structure.",
