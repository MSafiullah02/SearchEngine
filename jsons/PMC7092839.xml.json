This B cell repertoire contains various antibodies with high specificity and matured affinity for SARS-CoV. Compared with na\u00efve or synthetic antibody library, the immune library is more likely to obtain nature-like antibody with high specificity and affinity. Another feature to obtain nature-like antibody is in using complete SARS-CoV virions, rather than a single recombinant protein, as antigen for selections.
