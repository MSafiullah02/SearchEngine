Novel designs with simultaneous application of different AOPs can offer better solutions for cleaner water. Methods We have comparatively studied two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on decolourisation of Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) azo dye pollutant from water: gas plasma treatment by low power atmospheric pressure plasma using novel plasma needle configuration, and semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalysis using titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanopowders. Additionally, simultaneous application of two advanced oxidation processes on azo dye decolourisation was studied. Results It was found that plasma treatment is very efficient system for the dye removal even for low flow rates (1 slm) of the Ar as feed gas. The presence of 10% of O 2 in Ar flow intensified dye oxidation process and shortened required time for total decolourisation. When plasma and catalyst were simultaneously applied, TiO 2 was activated with a few Watts plasma source as well as 300 W UV lamp source. The synergic effect of two AOPs was more pronounced for higher feed gas flow rates, resulting in improved decolourisation efficiency. Conclusion Plasma needle can efficiently remove Reactive Orange 16 azo dye from water with a power consumption of only few Watts. With the addition of TiO 2 the removal efficiency is significantly improved.",

They are widely used in textile industry and because of their chemical complexity and low biodegradability; the wastewater treatment is very demanding. Different methods are applied to remove these organic compounds from the water sources: biological, physicochemical (adsorption, coagulation/flocculation, reverse osmosis) or chemical treatments (chlorination and ozonation). However, these methods have certain limitations. The biological treatments are not effective in the case of stable and resistant azo dyes. Only few unstable azo dyes can be degraded under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, anaerobic degradation causes aromatic amines generation which are toxic and carcinogenic [7] . The physicochemical treatments often cause formation of secondary pollution, generating large amounts of sludge and transferring pollutants from water to solid phase. Therefore, incomplete degradation and necessity for additional operations including final degradation of the waste and adsorbent regeneration limit the application of these treatments [8] . Chemical treatments like chlorination can result in complete decolourisation of dyes, but chlorinated organic by-products are very hazardous [9] . Ozone oxidizes dyes as well, but its extreme oxidizing effects can harm the atmosphere. Thus, ozonation system must include a control unit which prevents excessive use of chemicals [10] .",

Plasma systems can be generally divided into thermal or non-thermal plasma. Thermal plasma typically needs more power than non-thermal and creates high flux of heat, which can be used for degradation of very resistant organic molecules. In the case of non-thermal plasma, electrons are at temperatures as high as 11,000 K, and are colliding with gas molecules at temperatures as low as the room temperature, promoting the generation of chemically active species [18] .",

We have developed plasma needle setup to study the effects of flow rate, feed gas composition (Ar and Ar/O 2 mixture), and the eventual UV influence on the oxidation process.

The room-temperature PL spectra at 425 nm of the supernatant were analyzed on the Fluorescence Spectrometer (Spex Fluorolog) using 320 nm as excitation light, in order to estimate the concentration of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid.

The complexity of physical and chemical phenomena, which appear during the discharges in both gas and liquid phase, is considerable. For this reason, we studied different plasma needle treatment parameters (e.g. feed gas flow rate and composition) and their influence on the RO 16 oxidation process (decolourisation). Later, we have also studied combined plasma-heterogeneous photocatalysis in order to examine the potential oxidation synergic effects of plasma and catalyst and to verify whether plasma UV radiation was adequate to activate the TiO 2 surface. The TiO 2 based heterogeneous photocatalysis on RO 16 degradation was used as a benchmark.",

It can be observed that RO 16 decolourisation was faster for the increased flow rate of Ar (4 slm) and almost total decolourisation was achieved after 90 min. It is obvious that generation of radicals in plasma depends on gas flow rate. The higher is the flow rate, the faster is the decolourisation. However, the efficiency of radicals generation and plasma chemistry can be also tailored by changing the feed gas composition.

            "text": "The introduction of O 2 into the feed gas evidently influenced the oxidation process kinetics. The better efficiency of the RO 16 oxidation with the addition of O 2 can be a consequence of at least two reasons. The most apparent reason is that higher amount of active species, like OH \u00b7 , can be formed when O 2 is introduced in Ar because of the lower energy of the first ionization of O 2 (12.1 eV) compared to Ar (15.8 eV) . In their work, Gumuchian et al. [24] measured amount of OH \u00b7 in different compositions of feed gases and concluded that in Ar/O 2 feed gas mixture, the concentration of OH \u00b7 was the highest [24] . Beside this, atomic oxygen can react directly with organic pollutants, and together with O 2 can produce very reactive ozone (Eq. 6). Nevertheless, in the paper of Miyazaki et al. [54] it was shown that very small amount of ozone was produced if the Ar concentration in Ar/O 2 feed gas mixture is equal or higher than 80%. Since in our experiments 90% of Ar, was used, we suppose that ozone contribution in these experiments is not of great importance. Evidently, the presence of O 2 in the feed gas significantly improves the oxidation potentials of plasma needle, presumably due to the formation of more reactive species (Eqs. 2, [15] [16] .",

            "text": "Since the hydroxyl radicals are considered the primary oxidizing species their presence on the surface of the UV illuminated photocatalyst can be confirmed in reaction with terephthalic acid (TA) as a probe molecule. This acid reacts with OH \u00b7 radicals, generated at the water/TiO 2 interface, forming a highly fluorescent product: 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TA-OH), with intensive peak at about 425 nm [61] . Since PL peak intensity is proportional to the amount of generated OH \u00b7 radicals, by monitoring the changes in the intensity of 425 nm peak the hydroxyl radicals could be detected indirectly. From the Fig. 8b , it can be observed that the intensity of 425 nm peak increases in time, meaning that the concentration of hydroxyl radicals also increases [61, 62] . The spectrum labelled as \"0 min\" represents the pure TA solution recorded prior the UV irradiation source. These results clearly demonstrated that with increasing illumination time the increasing amount of OH \u00b7 radicals are formed at TiO 2 /water interface, responsible for dye degradation. Figure 9 illustrates the degradation kinetics of RO 16 during the combined TiO 2 and non-thermal plasma treatment-PC treatment. As can be seen from Fig. 9 , PC treatment is more efficient than PT (Fig. 4) for the same Ar flow rate of 1 slm. Namely, after 15 min more than 40% of dye was degraded under the PC treatment, whereas under PT the photodegradation of dye reached only15%. It is also evident that the time for complete decolourisation reduced from 150 to 120 min. Similar effect was observed with increased feed gas flow rate (4 slm) when the time for complete RO 16 decolourisation was shortened from 90 min (PT) to 60 min (PC). Improved decolourization of RO 16 can be ascribed to the synergic effect of plasma-photocatalysis process.",

PT treatment with Ar 1 slm (k = 24.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 min \u22121 ) manifest almost the same oxidation degree as heterogeneous photocatalysis (k = 22.8 \u00d7 10 -3 min \u22121 ).

Namely, among all experiments with different setups (HP, PT and PC), the PC rate constants are the highest (see Table 3 ).

Therefore, it can be concluded that the synergic effect of two AOPs is evident and very dependent on the flow rate of feed gas and gas mixture. PC experiment with quartz glass demonstrated that UV radiation from the plasma needle source evidently has influence on the TiO 2 photolytic activity and contribute to the RO 16 decolourisation process. Further investigations will be directed to the estimation of the optimal TiO 2 concentration, identification of RO 16 oxidation by-products and determination of their levels of toxicity.",

In the case of only plasma treatment, it was demonstrated that both flow rate and feed gas composition had significant effect on dye removal. The presence of O 2 in the feed gas, as well as, increased feed gas flow rate significantly improved the process of RO16 decolourisation as compared with the TiO 2 based heterogenous photocatalysis.",

The synergic effect of two AOPs was more pronounced at higher flow rate of the plasma feeding gas. Accordingly, we can conclude that simultaneous application of different AOPs can offer better solution for wastewater treatment and improves energy utilization efficiency when using plasma needle as UV source.
