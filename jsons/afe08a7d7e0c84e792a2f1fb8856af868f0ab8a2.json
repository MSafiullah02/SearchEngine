The aims of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral trazodone in experimental horses and to evaluate the effect of oral trazodone in clinical horses. Six experimental horses were administered trazodone at 7.5 or 10 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations of trazodone and its metabolite (m-CPP) were determined via UPLC-MS/MS. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis, sedation and ataxia scores were determined. Trazodone was rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a maximum concentration of 2.5-4.1 \u03bcg/ml and half-life of the terminal phase of approximately 7 hr. The metabolite was present at low levels in all horses, representing only 2.5% of the total area under the curve. In experimental horses, concentration-dependent sedation and ataxia were noted, lasting up to 12 hr. For clinical cases, medical records of horses treated with trazodone for various abnormal behaviours were reviewed and data were summarized. Trazodone was successful in modifying behavioural problems to some degree in 17 of 18 clinical cases. Tolerance and subsequent lack of drug effect occurred in two of 18 clinical cases following 14 or 21 days of use.

Some horses do not tolerate confinement well, due to temperament issues, separation or situational anxiety or a lack of acclimation. These horses may walk incessantly, weave, crib, rear, buck or kick the stall walls. These behaviour problems may contribute to delayed wound healing, new injury, recrudescence of illness, as well as damage to the stall and distress for owners. Management techniques such as environmental or social enrichment and free choice access to feed are often attempted, but may not be successful or appropriate for all cases. Herbal and supplemental calming products are available, using various amino acids as well as magnesium for effect; however, there is little scientific data available to judge these products and they are not always effective. If environmental enrichment and supplemental calming agents do not work, medications are often tried. Of these, the most commonly used agents are acepromazine, fluphenazine and reserpine, all of which carry an unacceptable risk of adverse events.

A short period of vacuum was applied to initiate absorption, and then, the cartridges were allowed to sit for 5 min. Next, 2.5 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether was applied to the cartridge and allowed to sit for 5 min without vacuum followed by light vacuum for 2 min. This process was repeated and the vacuum was applied until complete elution of the sample. The eluate was then evaporated under a stream of compressed nitrogen for 15 min at 45\u00b0C. The samples and standards were then reconstituted using 200 \u03bcl of 50/50 ACN:ddH 2 O (v/v). From this point, the samples and standards were further diluted accordingly to produce concentrations within a high and low concentration standard curve. The high concentration standard curve was prepared by adding 5 \u03bcl sample to 400 \u03bcl 50/50 ACN:ddH 2 O (v/v) and was used for concentrations of trazodone between 0.01 and 10 \u03bcg/ml. The low concentration standard curve was prepared by adding 100 \u03bcl sample to 250 \u03bcl 50/50 ACN:ddH 2 O (v/v) and was used for concentrations of trazodone and m-CPP between 0.001 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ ml.

The cause is unknown; however, it may be due to the sedative effects of the drug resulting in decreased anal tone and potential pneumorectum. Trazodone has been shown to affect the core body temperature in humans, resulting in a tendency to advance the appearance time of the minimal temperature based on daily temperature rhythms compared to placebo and this effect is related to the development of slow wave sleep(Suzuki , Yamadera, Nakamura, & Endo, 2002;Yamadera, Suzuki, Nakamura, & Endo, 1999). Conversely, trazodone has also been associated with hyperthermia in humans that develop neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome, although this typically only occurs with administration of multiple medications, including other serotonergic drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antipsychotics or dopamine antagonists(Sokoro, Zivot, & Ariano, 2011).
