Its symptoms and pathology are a direct result of invasion of host erythrocytes by the Plasmodium merozoite1, 2, a complex process that requires coordinated interactions between host erythrocyte and parasite surface proteins, because of which it is an attractive target for vaccine and drug development. Although more than 50 merozoite surface antigens are expressed on Plasmodium merozoite surface, till date barely 7\u221210 possible interactions between them and their erythrocyte receptors have been well documented3\u20135. Of these, merozoite surface antigens from two main families: erythrocyte binding proteins (EBPs) and reticulocyte binding like protein (RH) have mainly been studied for their role(s) in erythrocyte invasion6\u20138. The parasite ligand PfRh5, for example, binds to Basigin, an interaction found to be essential for invasion by all tested Plasmodium falciparum strains8\u201310. Basigin has also been shown to be a druggable target for anti-malarial interventions as anti-Basigin antibodies effectively block erythrocyte invasion by different Plasmodium strains11.",

CD147 or Basigin, acts as an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer that regulates a number of biological processes, such as spermatogenesis, lymphocyte responsiveness, and movement of monocarboxylate transporters13. These multiple activities of Basigin involve a number of interacting proteins12. Among several Basigin interacting proteins, Cyclophilins are an interesting class of proteins in terms of structural, functional, and medical implications12, 14, 15. Basigin functions as a signaling receptor for Cyclophilins A and B in a variety of immune cells and this interaction regulates inflammatory responses in a number of diseases, such as lung inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis16. Cyclophilins were discovered as host cell receptors for the potent immunosuppressive drug, Cyclosporin A17. Cyclophilins belong to the immunophilin class of proteins18 and some members of this family have been associated with parasitic diseases. Human malaria parasite P. falciparum encodes 13 immunophilins or immunophilin-like proteins; however, their exact functions are still unknown19\u201321.",

Conversely, anti-RhopH3 antibodies inhibit the binding of Cyclophilin B to the merozoite surface. We demonstrate a multi-protein receptor ligand interaction involving human CypB and Basigin, and Plasmodium PfRh5 and PfRhopH3. Additionally, by screening a codon-shuffled library we identify a 98 (aa)-long de novo peptide that inhibits the interaction between CypB and PfRhopH3 by binding to CypB and blocks invasion of the RBC by the Merozoites. Together, these results indicate that a multi-protein complex is formed involving CypB and PfRhopH3 and small molecules or peptides against these interacting proteins can act as potential drug candidates.",

            "text": "To look for novel host RBC and Plasmodium merozoite interactions, we used a bacterial two-hybrid22, 23 approach and screened a human tissue cDNA library against the PfRhopH3-C-terminal region (aa 617\u2013865, Supplementary Fig 1). Plasmodium Rhoptry proteins, as it has been shown previously, act as important ligands for host receptors during the invasion process24. Specifically, PfRhopH3 has been shown to form a complex with the merozoite protein MSP1 and subsequently interact with erythrocyte Band 3 proteins to facilitate invasion25, 26. On the basis of blue\u2212white selection, a putative colony positive for interaction was selected and the isolated DNA sequenced. Sequence analysis showed the host interacting partner of PfRhopH3-C as the full-length (aa 1\u2013208) human Cyclophilin B (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 4). The plasmids harbored in the selected colony were segregated, confirmed by PCR, and used to co-transform competent R1 Escherichia coli cells to verify the interaction. Two-hybrid plasmids expressing the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins ESAT6 and CFP10, and whose interaction has been well-documented previously22 acted as the positive control. These interactions are shown in Fig. 1b, c. As Cyclophilin B possesses endoplasmic reticulum (ER) directed signal sequence and is secreted out in chondrocytes cells27, 28, we analyzed its erythrocyte surface expression. As shown in Fig. 1d, immunolocalization analysis using anti-Cyclophilin B antibody stained the human RBC well, thereby demonstrating the expression of Cyclophilin B on the RBC surface. To investigate whether Cyclophilin B acts as a receptor for the binding of the merozoite to the RBC, we assessed the binding of Cyclophilin B protein to free P. falciparum merozoites. We have previously performed similar studies to show ICAM-4 binding to merozoites22. Cyclophilin B showed significant binding on the merozoite surface (Fig. 1e), and co-localized with PfRhopH3 (Supplementary Fig. 2e), thus suggesting it to be a receptor for merozoite binding of human RBCs. Further, we developed an intensity measurement-based Cyclophilin B-merozoite binding assay. Briefly, P. falciparum free merozoites were incubated with 25 \u00b5M of Cyclophilin B protein. Intensity of Cyclophilin B binding on P. falciparum merozoite surface was quantified on Nikon fluorescent confocal microscopy using NIS element. Figure 2a shows Cyclophilin B binding intensity on four merozoites. For intensity measurements, the mean binding intensity for ten merozoites was calculated (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\n",

Recombinant PfRhopH3-C protein was subsequently refolded by dialyzing it against a decreasing concentration of the denaturant. Antibodies were raised against the refolded PfRhopH3-C protein (Supplementary Methods). Supplementary Fig. 2b shows the differential migration of refolded PfRhopH3-C protein on SDS and Native PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions, suggesting proper folding of the protein. We next assessed the binding of recombinant PfRhopH3-C to the RBC surface. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2d, PfRhopH3-C protein bound specifically to the RBCs and co-localized with human CypB on the RBC surface with a Pearson\u2019s coefficient 0.62 (Fig. 3e). To determine whether PfRhopH3 is the ligand for Cyclophilin B, intensity measurement-based Cyclophilin B merozoite-binding assay was performed in the presence of anti-RhopH3 antibody. Briefly, free merozoites were incubated with anti-PfRhopH3 or anti-PfRAP2 antibodies where after washing, the treated merozoites were incubated with Cyclophilin B protein at a concentration of 25 \u00b5M. Cyclophilin B binding was assessed on the treated merozoites and compared with untreated merozoites. As shown in Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 4, merozoites treated with anti-RAP2 antibody displayed similar binding intensity for Cyclophilin B as shown with the untreated control merozoites. However, more than 50% reduction in Cyclophilin B binding to merozoite surface was observed when the merozoite surface was treated with anti-RhopH3-C antibody, in comparison to merozoites treated with anti-RAP2 antibody or untreated cells (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that Cyclophilin B is the receptor for a merozoite surface localized Rhoptry protein PfRhopH3, which is known to be part of a large PfRhopH complex involved in erythrocyte binding1, 29. We further performed in vitro interaction studies between Cyclophilin B and PfRhopH3 proteins. Both, ELISA-based binding analysis and Far-western analysis showed a tight and specific interaction between Cyclophilin B and PfRhopH3 proteins (Fig. 3a, b). A reciprocal ELISA was also performed to further confirm the interaction between CypB and PfRhopH3-C (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis further confirmed an interaction between Cyclophilin B and PfRhopH3 (Fig. 3c). To quantify the interaction between Cyclophilin B and PfRhopH3, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed. Cyclophilin B displayed a strong interaction with PfRhopH3 with an equilibrium dissociation constant K\nD value of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 M (Fig. 3d). Together, these results confirmed the involvement of a novel receptor-ligand (Cyclophilin B-PfRhopH3) interaction in the invasion of human erythrocytes by P. falciparum merozoites.\n",

Cyclophilin A-Basigin interaction also regulates inflammatory responses in a number of diseases and is a target for new anti-inflammatory therapeutics12. To investigate whether Cyclophilin B and Basigin are co-expressed at the same time on human RBC surface, co-immunolocalization studies using anti-Cyclophilin B and anti-Basigin antibodies were performed. Both these antibodies stained human erythrocytes, thereby showing the existence and expression of both these receptors on RBC surface simultaneously (Fig. 4a). We next performed co-binding studies with these proteins on the merozoite surface. Cyclophilin B as well as Basigin bound to merozoites simultaneously (Fig. 4b, c), thereby indicating that these proteins bind to independent ligands on the merozoite surface that are, most likely, PfRhopH3 and PfRh5 respectively.\n",

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, Basigin has been reported to bind with Plasmodium merozoite protein PfRh58, 31. A previous study has shown the co-localization of PfRh5 and PfRhopH3 on merozoite surface32 but their physical interaction has not yet been illustrated. Therefore, to determine whether Cyclophilin B specifically interacts with Basigin during Plasmodium merozoite invasion of RBCs and involved in complex formation, we carried-out protein\u2212protein interaction analysis between Cyclophilin B and Basigin, between PfRh5 and PfRhopH3, and between Basigin and PfRh5. ELISA-based binding studies were performed as described earlier22. All of the above-mentioned interactions turned out to be positive and furthermore, robust, thereby indicating the existence of a multi-protein interaction between the two P. falciparum merozoite surface ligands and the two corresponding RBC surface proteins (Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013d). Further, co-localization of PfRhopH3 and PfRh5 was confirmed on the merozoite surface with a Pearson\u2019s coefficient value of 0.62 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Interactions between Cyclophilin B and Basigin, PfRh5 and PfRhopH3 were also quantified by SPR analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5g, h). Both these interactions were strong with K\nD values of ~4.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M and 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 M respectively. A previous study8 has reported a strong interaction between Basigin and PfRh5 with a K\nD value of 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22126 M. We confirmed these interactions by Far-western blot and co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Fig. 5e, f). Together, these results strongly advocate an association between Cyclophilin B and Basigin on the RBC surface and between PfRh5 and PfRhopH3 on the merozoite surface. Based on these interaction analyses, we built a model shown in Supplementary Fig. 13.",

A bacterial two-hybrid screening was performed between the Cyclophilin B gene cloned in pTRGqq plasmid, referred as CYPBpTRGqq, and a de novo dicodon polypeptide synthetic library cloned in pBTnn plasmid referred as DIEL-pBTnn (Supplementary Fig 7g). CFP10pTRGnn/empty pBTnn and CFP10pTRGnn/ESAT6pBTnn served as the negative and positive controls, respectively22 (Fig. 5a, b). A 98 aa long de novo protein named CDP3 (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 7a) was identified as an interactor of Cyclophilin B after several rounds of segregation, re-cloning and re-transformations. We have earlier used a similar approach to identify the role of host ICAMs in cell invasion by M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum\n22. To further explore the interaction between CDP3 and Cyclophilin B, we cloned and expressed CDP3 in pMTSA plasmid. C-terminal Histidine-tagged CDP3 was purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain under denaturing conditions on Ni-NTA+ column and the protein was subsequently refolded by dialyzing it against a decreasing concentration of the denaturant. Purified and folded CDP3 protein was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Reciprocal ELISA-based interaction assays were performed between recombinant CDP3 and Cyclophilin B proteins. The binding of CDP3 with Cyclophilin B was found to be concentration dependent (Supplementary Fig. 7d). A set of wells coated with an unrelated non-specific protein HBHA did not show binding to Cyclophilin B. CDP3\u2013Cyclophilin B interaction was further studied and quantified by SPR. CDP3 displayed a very strong interaction with Cyclophilin B, with an equilibrium dissociation constant K\nD value of 7.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M (Supplementary Fig. 7e). Since CDP3 is a binder of CypB, its binding and co-localization with CypB was evaluated on the RBC surface. Both proteins were co-localized on the RBC surface with a Pearson\u2019s coefficient of 0.46 (Supplementary Fig 3a). We next evaluated the effect of CDP3 on the binding of Cyclophilin B with PfRhopH3-C using a bacterial three-hybrid system developed earlier by us35. This system allowed us to transform the \u201cblue\u201d two-hybrid reporter strain carrying PfRhopH3-C-pBTqq and CYPB-pTRGqq vectors with a third compatible plasmid pMTSA expressing the CDP3 protein. As the gene cloned in pMTSA vector was under the tight regulation of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter, triple-transformed clones were plated on X-gal plates with and without L-arabinose. As shown in Fig. 5c, d, expression of CDP3 in the presence of l-arabinose turned the PfRhopH3-C/Cyclophilin B strain from blue to white, indicating the disruption of interaction between PfRhopH3 and Cyclophilin B. Arabinose gradient liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assay further confirmed the disruption of interaction by CDP3 (Fig. 5e). The disruption was specific and quantitative as it increased with the increasing expression of CDP3 induced as a function of arabinose concentration (Fig. 5e, f). The disruption of interaction between PfRhopH3 and Cyclophilin B by CDP3 was further studied using an ELISA-based interaction assay. Incubation of Cyclophilin B coated wells with different concentrations of recombinant CDP3 protein resulted in a dose dependent reduction in PfRhopH3 binding to Cyclophilin B (Supplementary Fig. 7f). Further, we tested the efficiency of CDP3 to block the interaction between CypB and Basigin in an ELISA-based binding assay. CDP3 was unable to block the interaction between CypB and Basigin (Supplementary Fig. 8c) indicating that it is specific to the PfRhopH3-C and CypB interaction. Together, these results showed that CDP3 is an effective binder of human Cyclophilin B and further, it disrupts the hitherto strong interaction between Cyclophilin B and PfRhopH3. This potent ability of CDP3 prompted us to evaluate further the role of Cyclophilin B in P. falciparum invasion of host cells. As CDP3, a product of a de novo codon-shuffled library, has no homology to any known protein, we studied its secondary structural elements by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectra of the protein was analyzed using circular dichroism neural network (CDNN) tool and found to be composed of ~29% Helix and ~19% \u03b2-sheets. (Supplementary Fig. 9).\n",

Although the precise anti-malarial mode of action of CsA is not yet known, CsA has been proposed to bind Plasmodium-encoded Cyclophilins and Cyclophilin-like proteins39. To confirm the role of Cyclophilins in the merozoite invasion of RBCs, and to know whether CsA acts by blocking the interaction between CypB and PfRhopH3-C, we tested its inhibitory potential in an ELISA-based inhibition assay. Importantly, CsA blocked the interaction between CypB and PfRhopH3-C (Supplementary Fig. 8a). To test whether CsA can also block the interaction between RhopH3-C and CypB in vivo, a liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assay was performed using CsA as an inhibitor. The results showed that CsA is a potent inhibitor of CypB/PfRhopH3 interaction in an in vivo system, too (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Further, we repeated the invasion assay using human RBCs treated with the drug Cyclosporin A. To find out whether Cyclophilins expressed on the human erythrocyte are important for the P. falciparum merozoite invasion of RBCs, human RBCs were treated with different concentrations of CsA for 1 h and treated RBCs were added at 2% hematocrit to synchronized and purified P. falciparum cultures at schizont stage in complete RPMI medium. After 42\u201348 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, newly formed parasites were scored. A concentration dependent reduction in the erythrocyte invasion was observed after treatment of human RBCs with CsA, with a maximum reduction of ~80% observed in RBCs treated with 100 \u03bcM of CsA (Fig. 6c). A similar dose-dependent decrease in parasitemia was witnessed with three other strains of P. falciparum: Dd2 (sialic acid dependent strain), HB3 (sialic acid-independent strain) and 7G8 (chloroquine resistant strain) (Fig. 6d). Simultaneously, we also tested the ability of CsA to block merozoite invasion by adding it directly in the culture during the invasion where it can bind to the RBC Cyclophilin B as well as merozoite Cyclophilins. As shown in Fig. 6e, CsA when added directly into the culture, showed better inhibitory potential; maximum reduction of parasitemia (~80%) was observed with 50 \u03bcM of CsA treatment. This indicates that upon direct addition to the culture, CsA may have bound to both, the RBC Cyclophilins as well as the merozoite Cyclophilins, in keeping with the findings of a previous report that showed reduced invasion efficiency for CsA treated merozoites40. These results were reproducible over three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicates.",

To be sure, CsA has previously been shown to cause eryptosis41 in the course of treatment in mice. That said, a molecular analogue similar to CsA that can specifically target the interaction between PfRhopH3 and Cyclophilin B would, we believe, be efficacious in blocking parasite invasion.

            "text": "In summary, we have applied a bacterial two-hybrid screening approach to identify Cyclophilin B as a novel receptor for a well-known P. falciparum surface protein, PfRhopH3. We confirmed the interaction between host Cyclophilin B and merozoite PfRhopH3 protein by employing a range of protein\u2212protein interaction tools, such as protein\u2212protein interaction assays, SPR, far-western co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization. We developed a Cyclophilin B merozoite binding assay and showed a reduction in Cyclophilin B binding on the merozoite surface in the presence of anti-PfRhopH3 antibodies, thereby confirming a receptor-ligand interaction between these two proteins. To investigate whether host Cyclophilin B does indeed play a role in merozoite invasion of human RBCs, we screened Cyclophilin B against a synthetic polypeptide library and identified a 98 amino acid long protein CDP3 that binds to Cyclophilin B and inhibits its biologically significant interaction with PfRhopH3. Importantly, addition of CDP3 inhibited the invasion of RBC by P. falciparum merozoites. Next, we tested the ability of the drug CsA to block the interaction between CypB and PfRhopH3 in vitro and in vivo; in both the assays CsA blocked these interactions. Further, the ability of CsA to block the host Cyclophilin B on the RBC surface was tested. We found that it efficiently blocked the merozoite invasion of treated RBCs, thereby confirming that Cyclophilin B is an important receptor for the merozoite invasion of RBCs. On the other hand, Basigin or CD147, an important integral plasma membrane glycoprotein that has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological activities and in particular for its role in inflammation and in merozoite invasion of human RBCs, performs these multiple functions by interacting with several human proteins or partners1. Basigin also functions as a signaling receptor for extracellular Cyclophilins A and B to mediate their chemotactic activities42. In neuron cells, interaction of CypA or CypB with Basigin has been shown to trigger a Ca2+ flux that results in the activation of ERK1/2 kinases43. Encouragingly, molecules that disrupt the interaction between Cyclophilins and Basigin are being developed for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and coronaviruses44, 45. Since Basigin has been shown to be an important receptor for merozoite invasion of RBCs8, we tested the co-expression and interaction of Basigin and Cyclophilin B. Both Basigin and Cyclophilin B were found to be expressed at the same time on human RBC surface and interact with each other. We further showed an interaction between their ligands PfRh5 and PfRhopH3 on merozoite surface, thereby suggesting a role of Cyclophilin B/Basigin signaling in merozoite invasion of RBCs. It is conceivable the interaction of CypB with Basigin is triggering a Ca2+ flux, known to be essential for P. falciparum merozoite invasion46. The parasite has been known to use multiple redundant pathways to gain entry into the RBCs1. We had earlier shown how dose-dependent inhibition of the RBC surface protein ICAM-4 results in blocking of the invasion process22. Inhibition of Basigin through anti-Basigin antibodies, as stated earlier, also leads to blocking of the parasite invasion8. In this context, the elucidation of a multi-protein interaction at the host-pathogen junction consisting of Cyclophilin B, Basigin, PfRhopH3, and PfRh5, the first two host proteins while the next two parasite proteins, offers an important handle for targeting parasite invasion at multiple levels. Finally, the finding that inhibitors of Cyclophilin B and Basigin are able to prevent the invasion of tested P. falciparum strains could provide an alternative option for future development of therapeutics.",

The ligation temperature was increased to 16 \u00b0C and incubated for another 12 h. DNA precipitation and extraction from the ligation mixture was carried out using the phenol/chloroform procedure, the DNA resuspended in milli-Q water and digested with XbaI enzyme for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C, after which 1 \u03bcl of the digested DNA was used as a template for PCR using HP2P primer that served both as a forward and reverse primer34. Elution of the PCR product was carried out using DEAE membrane and the assembled DNA fragments fractionated based on their lengths (100\u2013500 bp). The purified fragments were used as inserts for creation of de novo libraries in pBTnn and pTRGnn vectors once they had been cut with SnaBI and dephosphorylated.",

The co-transformants were plated on X-Gal indicator plates containing kanamycin (50 \u00b5g mL\u22121), chloramphenicol (30 \u00b5g mL\u22121), tetracycline (12.5 \u00b5g mL\u22121), X-Gal (80 \u00b5g mL\u22121), Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (25 \u00b5M), and phenylethyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (200 \u00b5M).

Competent cells co-transformed with CFP10pTRGnn DNA and empty pBTnn plasmid represented the negative control. The indicator plates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 36 h. The test plates were screened for positive interactions based on development of blue colonies. The plasmids harbored in the blue colonies were segregated, confirmed using PCR, re-cloned back into their respective plasmids and co-transformed in R1 competent cells to verify the interaction. Finally, the partner pBTnn and pTRGnn plasmids were sequenced and a BLAST analysis performed to identify the interacting protein. This was found to be Human Cyclophilin B (CYPB; Peptidylprolyl Isomerase B or PPIB). Similarly, a Bacterial two-hybrid experiment was performed to identify inhibitors of chosen target proteins from de novo Dicodon libraries. Cyclophilin B (CypB) gene, cloned in plasmid pTRGqq, was used as a bait. A de novo DIEL dicodon library was cloned in pBTqq vector and the plasmids used to co-transform the R1 strain. Blue colonies obtained were analyzed in the same manner as described above and the interacting partner of CypB was identified.",

Invasion Assay using CDP3: a Invasion inhibition of P. falciparum strains 3D7 and Dd2 by CDP3 into culture. Purified recombinant CDP3 protein (1\u201325 \u00b5M) was added to mature schizont stage parasite culture and the parasitaemia estimated after 40 h using flow cytometry. The data represent an average of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate. Invasion observed in control culture was taken as 100%. The CDP3 buffer components did not affect parasite invasion. b Similarly, Uninfected RBCs were treated with CDP3 (10, 25, 50 \u00b5M) for 4 h at RT followed by 3D7 merozoites infection. Parasitemia was analyzed using FACS. c\u2212e Dose dependent inhibition of invasion by CsA treatment of RBC: Uninfected BCs treated with CsA (2.5\u2013100 \u00b5M) followed by 3D7 merozoites infection. Invasion was reduced by ~80%. Similar results were obtained by using different strains of P. falciparum including Dd2, HB3 and 7G8. CsA (12.5\u201350 \u00b5M) added in culture at late schizont stage; parasitemia was estimated after 40 h. 80\u201390% inhibition of invasion was observed.
