            "text": "Patterns of interactions and contacts between individuals in populations are recognised as important factors shaping the spread of infectious diseases1,2. Mathematical models are routinely used in analysis of epidemic data and prediction of epidemic trends3,4. A wealth of different options for how to describe social interactions in mathematical models is available, ranging from assuming homogeneous mixing5,6, through analytically tractable models that focus on households, age structure or other idealised properties of the contact network1,2,7,8, to complex individual-based stochastic simulations1,9\u201312. However, few comparative tools exist to guide the initial choice of structure when designing a mathematical modelling study. One common approach is statistical, comparing models by their ability to fit the data, or seeking a trade-off between the quality of data fitting and model parsimony. However, when data are limited, like at the beginning of an emerging epidemic, different models can fit the same data equally well and nevertheless lead to different predictions. These methods would then favour the simplest model, and would therefore not highlight whether further data should be collected to parameterise a more complicated model whose predictions can be significantly different.",

Such multi-model ensemble methods, well established in the field of numerical weather forecast15, have recently started gaining momentum in epidemiology16\u201318, with different modelling groups sometimes asked to perform predictions of the impact of realistic control policies based on shared scenarios10,18\u201321. These comparative studies have proven popular with complex models and policy makers concerned with over-reliance on advice from single modelling groups, but so far have provided little insight into the causes of differences between models. In addition, unidentifiability issues owing to the large number of parameters are sometimes not discussed, and often dealt with through an informal and difficult-to-reproduce calibration procedure22. Furthermore, comparing models by fitting them to the same set of data (or small number of shared scenarios23) provides results that are useful in that specific context but often hard to generalise to other settings18,23 or pathogens.",

We then test the ability of these different models to predict: the average final size (z), the average peak daily incidence (\u03c0) and the average time to the peak daily incidence (t) of a single epidemic wave. Given model AH includes all others as submodels, we compare predictions by assuming model AH perfectly represents reality and measuring other models\u2019 deviations from it. More specifically, we extensively explore the parameter space of model AH and for each parameter combination we compute, in addition to the outputs of interest, those quantities that are most likely to be measured or estimated from early data in the initial phase of the epidemic, namely: the basic reproduction number R0, i.e., the average number of cases a typical case generates in a fully susceptible population (this is not trivial for models with households; see Methods and Supplementary Methods, Sections 1.2.4 and 1.4); the ratio of adults versus children among new incident cases; and the household secondary attack rate (SAR), i.e., the average size of a within-household outbreak. These quantities, hereafter referred to as the observables, are then used to map (i.e., compute deterministically, assuming no error or noise) the parameters of the models A, H and U, the outputs of which are then compared with the assumed-true ones of model AH and considered inaccurate when they differ by more than a specified threshold \u03b5 in relative terms. In computing model outputs and observables, we assume permanent immunity following infection, as well as constant parameter values and no demographic changes, i.e., we have in mind a relatively fast infection with negligible disease-induced mortality and no intervention nor behavioural or environmental change. In addition, despite the models used here being stochastic, for maximum computational efficiency we only focus on average values (infinite population limit).",

Model U predicts a final size z of 80%, a peak daily incidence \u03c0 of 5.5% and t = 9.8 generation times to the peak (we chose the generation time37 as the time unit to facilitate translation to other infections). These values are common to all models (Fig. 1, bottom-left corner of all panels) when there is no household transmission (within-household transmission probability paa = 0) and children and adults are equally susceptible (relative susceptibility \u03c8 = 1). For a fair comparison, the parameter explorations for all models are performed at fixed R0, i.e., larger values of the within-household transmission probability paa correspond to suitably smaller values of between-household transmission. Both the final size z (Fig. 1a) and the peak incidence \u03c0 (Fig. 1b) appear to decrease when increasing age difference in susceptibility (i.e., increasing \u03c8): this result is known for the final size in the absence of households5,38,39, but appears to hold also for the peak incidence, and to extend to any amount of within-household transmission. Conversely, both outputs increase when transmission is shifted from between to within households (increasing paa at constant R0). Comparing Fig. 1a, d and g and b, e and h, it appears that, for both final size z and peak incidence \u03c0, model A is better than model H at mirroring the qualitative behaviour of model AH (though note that model H has only two free parameters, whereas model A has four, of which two shared with model AH: see description of model A in the Methods and Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.1.2). It also appears that the joint contribution of age and household structure in model AH can be roughly decomposed in the separate contribution of the two social structures (Fig. 1a, b contain elements of d and e for increasing \u03c8, and of g and h for increasing paa), but that models A and H, respectively, underestimate and overestimate both the final size and the peak incidence. Predictions of time to the peak t (Fig. 1c) seem to decrease when increasing both paa and \u03c8, but are more complex to interpret and overall show limited variation (much variation would come from stochastic delays in the very early epidemic phase, but these are minimised on purpose to detect structural differences in epidemic speed between models). Results are qualitatively similar for other values of R0 and relative infectivity \u03d5 (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.1.2).",

Figure 3a reports the overall simplest-model acceptance regions for varying values of R0 and the relative infectivity of children versus adults \u03d5, still under baseline random mixing. For increasing R0 (left to right), the household structure becomes less relevant for accurate predictions, unless within-household transmission is extremely high. Intuitively, at least for the final size, this is because at large R0 almost all the population ends up infected, leaving very little room for stronger within-household transmission to increase it further (Fig. 1a). Despite not being capped, as the final size is by the total population, the peak incidence shows a similar behaviour. Figure 3a confirms the intuition that, under random mixing, the age structure can be neglected when age classes do not differ much in susceptibility and that the household structure can be neglected when not much transmission occurs in households. Quantifying this intuition, however, is an important result of this analysis. On the other hand, when realistic UK contact patterns25 are assumed, as in Fig. 3b, the age structure becomes absolutely crucial for accurate predictions, whereas the household structure remains important only at large values of within-household transmission.",

            "text": "To facilitate intuition about the quantitative meaning of Fig. 3, we locate points in the parameter space corresponding to some scenarios inspired by real infections. Scenario 1 is characterised by parameters in the ballpark of H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza (points 1): R0 \u2248 1.5, \u03d5 \u2248 1, \u03c8 \u2248 233 and values of paa from 0.1 to 0.4, corresponding to the wide range of SAR estimates found in the literature35, from  <10%40 up to 40%35. At the low end of this range, Fig. 3 suggests the household structure can be neglected, whereas at the high end the household structure should be retained, at least when mixing is heterogeneous (Fig. 3b, points 1). Scenario 2 has parameter values closer to those estimated for the 1918 influenza pandemic34, with a higher R0 than in 2009, and children apparently not more susceptible but potentially more infectious than adults. We choose R0 \u2248 2, \u03d5 \u2248 2, \u03c8 \u2248 1 and paa \u2248 0.3 (leading to a SAR of ~30%34) and conclude that the household structure can (just about) be ignored, whereas the age stratification is necessary when mixing is heterogeneous (Fig. 3b, point 2). However, we note that the higher transmissibility seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic compared to the 2009 one might be partially owing to a different demography and social structure, in particular with larger households. For Scenario 3, we imagine the hypothetical invasion in a fully susceptible population of a highly transmissible infection, with characteristics similar to common childhood infections like measles or chickenpox: R0 \u2248 4, \u03d5 \u2248 1 and a trade-off between \u03c8 and paa owing to the fact that only child-to-child estimates of transmission probability are available in the literature (see Supplementary Methods, Section 1.6.5). This leads to a range of possible points 3 in Fig. 3, all of which suggest the household structure can be ignored, whereas the age stratification is essential. Applications to other topical emerging infections (e.g., SARS, MERS, Ebola) would also be possible, though data scarcity and other limitations highlighted in the Discussion suggest conclusions in these cases would be rather tentative. Furthermore, parameter values for SARS and Ebola, with their marked lower susceptibility of children compared with adults41, would not appear in the range displayed in Fig. 3.",

This dependence is explored more extensively in Fig. 4a, where the values of the SAR along the lines at which model A differ by 5% in relative terms from model AH (the borders between the light blue and red regions in Fig. 3b) are collected for all values of \u03c8 ranging from 1 to 4 and for \u03d5 =  1, 1.5 and 2, and plotted against R0. The relationship appears approximately linear (Fig. 4a) for a wide range of values of R0, except for R0 close to its threshold value of 1 or for a SAR roughly above 70%.

Current estimates of the final size from retrospective analysis in Italy are even lower (in the range 15\u201330%12,46), but such discrepancy is easily imputable to interventions and spontaneous social distancing, and possibly a different demography and more refined age structure of these studies compared with the simple two-class one presented here.

The situation is more complex in the opposite case, as sometimes we have found the mapping from model AH to model A to fail (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.3). The insight is that, when children are less susceptible or infectious than adults, sometimes the mixing imposed by the household structure results in an age-stratified incidence that cannot be reproduced by an age-stratified model alone (with the same contact rates), irrespective of the level of assortative mixing assumed. In this sense, the household structure becomes essential to reconcile observed disease dynamics and measured contact rates of adults and children. More research, in particular, on the implications for public health, is needed in this direction. Except in this region of the parameter space, though, the household structure does appear in general less relevant for accurate predictions than the age structure (Fig. 3). Throughout, we have assumed a 5% accuracy threshold, which is probably optimistic in an emerging epidemic scenario. However, the same result appears even more strikingly at less-stringent accuracy requirements, as the need for household structure drops, whereas the age structure, at least with heterogeneous and assortative mixing patterns, remains essential (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.2.2 and Supplementary Fig. 16).",

Despite being chosen for their public health relevance, other outputs might be of more interest, depending on the question addressed. We then only presented results in terms of aggregate outputs (some comments on age-stratified final size appear in the Supplementary Discussion, Sections 2.1.2 and 2.2.2). Furthermore, we also exploited the fact that model AH includes all the others as submodels and we were therefore able to compare predictions by studying the divergence of the outputs of simpler models from the assumed truth of model AH. Alternative choices would be required in the absence of a full model. Finally, we chose to keep R0 fixed across all model, whereas another perhaps even more natural choice would have been to fix the real-time growth rate r. This would have been feasible in the case of models involving constant transition rates between compartments (analytical methods for computing r in the presence of household can be found, e.g., in8), but the lack of exact results in the case of the time-since-infection modelling framework assumed here (see Methods and Supplementary Methods, Sections 1.1.3, 1.2.9 and 1.4) would have caused significant loss in computational efficiency. A brief exploration (only in the baseline scenario: see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.2) leads to similar results, with simpler models appearing even more likely to be accurate than the constant-R0 comparison suggests. This is in line with previous results42,47 showing that ignoring the household structure in the time-since-infection model used here leads to an overestimation of R0: models with households, therefore, when forced to match the same R0, need to compensate with a slightly larger overall infectivity, and this leads to a larger final size and peak incidence, if instead the models are calibrated on the same r, no compensation in infectivity is needed and models with no households are likely more accurate on a larger region of the parameter space (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.3.2). However, not all aspect of the present study can be captured by the simple comparison of R0 and r42,47, given past work is restricted to the exponentially growing phase, whereas the present study investigates also the late epidemic behaviour.",

The first and most obvious one is the lack of uncertainty: despite models being stochastic, the comparison is performed by deterministically mapping parameters from one model to another, thus ignoring the impact of any randomness, noise or estimation bias on model observables and outputs; in addition, final predictions are deterministic. It would not be difficult to compare the full distributions of model outputs, but more complicated results than binary acceptance/rejection of simpler models based on arbitrary thresholds would likely be harder to present and interpret. A more significant step would be to implement uncertainty in the model-mapping process. However, the choice we made in this study was to trade proper uncertainty management for the ability to perform extensive exploration of the space of observables, as any formal statistical estimation procedure, especially, if Bayesian in nature, would have been computationally challenging, and possibly difficult to automatise. Nevertheless, the role of uncertainty could still be roughly quantified by heuristically considering confidence intervals around each quantity in Fig. 3 (or similar figures, for values that do not appear there), given that boundaries appear to be changing monotonically with parameters: for example, for confidence intervals (1.5, 2) for R0 and (20%, 40%) for the SAR, from Fig. 3 one can still conclude the clear need for age, and the need for household structure in the lowest R0 range only when SAR  >30% and with decreasing and ultimately vanishing need as R0 increases (\u03d5 and \u03c8 are almost irrelevant).",

Furthermore, with more parameters, results would be again more difficult to present, so it was deemed less relevant in the first instance. However, for practical purposes, for example, in the case of influenza, it would be relevant to have at least a third age group, i.e., seniors, who make up a substantial fraction of developed countries\u2019 population and typically have lower contact rates25, potentially reduced susceptibility owing to prior immunity33,36,48 and higher risk of severe symptoms49.",

Outbreak response would likely reduce contact rates over time, (as well as time intervals to notification or hospitalisation52), causing the actual epidemic to deviate from initial forecasts.

However, such early predictions would still be highly informative in assessing the impact of interventions (or additional impact after estimates became available) by comparison with the epidemic outcome actually observed. Finally, note that potential factors playing a role only under certain intervention scenarios would not be useful to tease apart models compared in the absence of such interventions; however, this is not a limitation of the current methodology, but rather a typical out-of-sample prediction problem17.",

Improvements are certainly possible, but we believe the general approach proposed here should be adopted for comparing models and shed light on how structural model components affect predictions. In the particular case of age and household structure, substantial information is still needed early on in an outbreak of a new emerging infection for an appropriate, scientifically driven model choice. Nevertheless, the present analysis suggests that, in many real-world scenarios, households give limited additional accuracy in overall descriptors of epidemic severity for high cost in terms of model complexity and, despite the risk of slightly underestimating the epidemic severity, are probably worth neglecting in the first instance, when limited information is available and rapid predictions are needed.",

In the presence of explicit expressions for the observables, which is rarely the case, one could simply invert them to map parameters directly from one model to another42. In the absence of explicit expressions, iterative methods must be used (see Supplementary Methods, Section 1.1.1), which require solving the forward problem multiple times and might become prohibitive for computationally costly simulations. The efficiency of our approach stems from the fact that the context we have focussed on, though rather specific, is rich in analytical results: in particular, thanks to the latest methodological advances in the computation of R0 for households models47,60, the observables of all models can be obtained without having to integrate the system dynamics.

The thick black line shows the empirical rule of thumb, with parameters reported in the figure (\u03b71, regression coefficient; \u03b70, intercept), and is empirically chosen to: be closer to the dark than the grey dashed line, reflecting low confidence in extreme differences between adults and children; and provide an acceptable fit for both the SAR values obtained assuming UK-like mixing (here) and random mixing (see Supplementary Discussion, Section 2.4). Note that part of the spread in the data points is owing to the ruggedness of the borders between regions (contour lines in Supplementary Fig. 16B): a smaller step in paa and \u03c8 would reduce the spread but increase the computational cost.",
