An increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the desire to treat pathogens that do not respond to antibiotics, such as viral pathogens, has prompted many researches to use antibodies as alternative to antibiotics [1]. IgY (immunoglobulin in yolk) antibodies are the predominant serum immunoglobulin in birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and are transferred from serum to egg yolk in the females to confer passive immunity to their embryos and neonates [2]. The potential of orally administered IgY for the prevention and treatment of many pathogens has been studied for many years, for Escherichia coli\n[3], Helicobacter pylori\n[4], Salmonella\n[5], Rotavirus\n[6], Staphylococcus\n[7], Streptococcus mutans\n[8], Yersinia\n[9], Coronavirus\n[10], and the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [11]. This paper evaluates the efficiency of IgY against enterovirus 71 (EV71).",

These virions consist of a non-enveloped capsid surrounding a core of single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA approximately 7.5 kb in size [12]. Since the initial description of EV71 in 1974 [13], outbreaks of this virus have been identified periodically in countries throughout the world, including the USA, Australia, Sweden, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, Hong Kong, and Malaysia [14]. In 1998, an outbreak of EV71 infections occurred in Taiwan, in which 405 children were hospitalized and 78 died [15]. EV71 infections are generally mild, like hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina, but occasionally lead to severe diseases such as aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis, and even fatal encephalitis in neonates [16], [17], [18]. In recent years, some efforts have been made to control EV71 infections. The most promising antiviral agents for EV71 are WIN-group compounds, which have undergone clinical trials [19], [20]. In addition, a research group from Taiwan has developed two candidate EV71 vaccines, including a formalin-inactivated whole virus vaccine and a VP1 expressing DNA vaccine [21]. The efficacy of both vaccine constructs is currently being tested in animal models.",

            "text": "Several approaches have been attempted in the treatment of viral diseases. Researchers tried to block the replication of virus through binding the capsid of virus with some chemicals, such as pyridazinamines [22], phenoxyl imidazoles [23], or pleconaril [24], [25]. However, the treatment of EV71 with pleconaril was not significant, the binding of pleconaril with capsid was limited under higher viral concentration in vitro\n[26]. A specific antibody which could bind with the virus and hence reduce the contact of virus with host cells is an alternative choice. Human's immunoglobulin has been applied in the treatment of EV71 infections in babies whose immune system are not well-developed [27], [28]. There is no routine therapy for the treatment of EV71 infection with human's immunoglobulin so far. However, some animal model of EV71 challenged mouse has been developed, and provided some information about the protective effects of the neutralizing antibody on EV71 infection [29]. Compared to traditional antibody production, chicken as bio-factory can produce higher yield of IgY antibodies than mammals\u2019 IgG. A chicken can lay 280 eggs in a year and an egg yolk contains 100\u2013200 mg of IgY antibodies.",

The plate was then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After washing with PBS\u2013Tween 20 buffer, 2% BSA blocking was conducted overnight at 4 \u00b0C.

To generate the standard curve, wells were filled with 100 \u03bcl serial-diluted pure chicken IgY at a concentration from 0.015 \u03bcg/ml to 1 \u03bcg/ml (Promega, G116A) and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for overnight.

The absorbance was then measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Multiskan MS: Thermo Labsystems). The resulting absorbance of standard curves provided a relative measurement of anti-EV71 IgY concentration. For the total IgY determination, each well on the microtiter plate was first coated with 100 \u03bcl of rabbit anti-chicken IgY antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma C2288), to which 100 \u03bcl of 10,000-fold diluted WSF was then added.

This variation in antibody production, based on the specific IgY production, might be the result of differences in individual immune responses [3]. The origin of antigen also plays an important role in the immune response, as different outer membrane proteins or fimbrial adhesions from the bacteria affected the rate of IgY production [5], [9]. When the protein antigen contained whole bacteria, or when the virus achieved better specific antibody production, the in vivo neutralization effect of the resultant antibody was also better [7]. This study used the whole virus as the antigen source to obtain a better IgY titer. The total protein obtained from an egg yolk by the water dilution method is around 595 mg per egg. This protein contains few lipids and lipoproteins, and accounts for one-sixth of the total protein of a yolk [42]. In this study, the purity of IgY in WSF was approximately 30\u201340% (Table 1). This demonstrates that the water dilution method can easily separate the IgY from other egg yolk components, as described previously [4], [34].",

The results revealed no therapeutic effect. On the contrary, if the neutralization titer value of specific IgY was 128 or higher, the protective effects were significant (Table 2).

Compared to the control group, the mice in specific IgY treated group not only had a lower mortality, but also had normal weight gains. Most of the mice in control group showed a weight loss 5 days after the viral challenge, and continued to lose body weight until they died. Less than 10% of the sick mice in the control group survived the artificial infection of EV71 at a dose of 105\n pfu per mouse. The surviving mice gained some weight despite showing signs of illness. After reaching a body weight of 4.5\u20135.0 g, they recovered from the infection and returned to healthy status. However, their subsequent weight gains were only 60\u201370% of the mice in the specific IgY treated group (data not shown).

In practical situations, children infected by EV71 will probably only receive the IgG treatment after they exhibit the typical symptoms. To determine the critical timing of effective treatment, trials 5 and 6 applied specific IgY treatment one and two days later, respectively. Clearly, the starting time of specific IgY injection was essential in reducing the mortality of infected mice. If IgY was given on 4\u20136 dpi, at which point most mice exhibited the symptoms of hind limb paralysis, only 37% of infected mice survived. It has been reported that on the first day of EV71 infection, the virus is kept in the small intestine, and then spreads to other organs on 2 dpi. The virus attacks most organs on 3 dpi, including the brain stem, lung, spinal cord, and muscle [31], [48]. If we started the specific IgY treatment on 2 dpi, which corresponds to the onset of clinical symptoms in children, then the therapeutic outcome was improved. In this case, the survival rate of the EV71-infected mice could be increased to 79%, highlighting the importance of the timing of specific IgY treatment. Before the on-set of clinical symptoms, specific IgY treatment has a better chance of achieving effective therapy.",

The mortality among specific IgY treated mice was 24% (10/41), which was significantly lower than that of the control group, at 69% (33/48).

When the challenge was carried out orally with a dose of 3 \u00d7 106\n pfu per mouse, the lower morbidity in IgY treated group proved that the protection could be achieved by the neutralization of virus in the gastroenteric duct, thereby reducing the mortality of challenged mice.",
