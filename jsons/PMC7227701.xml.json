Like other flaviviruses including dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), ZIKV is an arbovirus, with mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, particularly Aedes aegypti, transmitting ZIKV between human and non-human primate (NHP) hosts.1\u20133 Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, but some individuals develop mild symptoms after infection that include fever, headaches, lethargy, rash, arthralgia, and/or myalgia. Outbreaks of ZIKV infections across islands in the Pacific Ocean and in the Americas (primarily Brazil) between 2007 and 2016, however, have indicated both previously unreported modes of transmission including sexual, vertical, and through blood transfusions/organ transplant as well as new, severe signs of ZIKV infection.3\u20135 The most significant of these new manifestations is a dramatic increase in the incidence of microcephaly, congenital blindness, and other severe birth defects in babies born to mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. Subsequent studies in mice and humans have since confirmed that ZIKV is a teratogen.3,6\u20139 Additionally, ZIKV infection was also found to increase the risk for development of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome post recovery.8 This alarming increase in cases of microcephaly and other birth defects following ZIKV infections prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV infection a global health emergency in 2016.4,10",

Vaccines targeting ZIKV have been made in several formulations including purified inactivated virus, protein subunits, adenovirus vectors, DNA plasmids, and RNA.11\u201316 Each of these has been shown to induce ZIKV-specific immune responses in mice and NHPs that can protect these animal models against morbidity and mortality following ZIKV challenge. Some of these vaccines are now being evaluated in phase I clinical trials.11 A second line of investigation for ZIKV therapeutics is the isolation and production of anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for passive transfer into infected patients. Several antibodies have been identified and isolated from ZIKV-infected patients that are capable of neutralizing in vitro infection by a broad panel of ZIKV isolates from Africa, Asia, and the Americas.",

            "text": "Therapeutic mAbs can be an effective means of combating infectious diseases, but factors including a laborious production process and the need for repeated dosing to maintain protective serum levels make them cost-prohibitive, which limit their clinical application. To overcome some of these barriers, our group has pioneered a method that uses DNA plasmid technology as a delivery vehicle for these antibodies. Delivery of DNA plasmids encoding genes of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs) into muscle followed by electroporation stimulates long-term, in vivo production of the mAbs which significantly reduces costs by eliminating both the need for ex vivo production and purification of protein mAbs and the need for repeated dosing. Furthermore, using DNA plasmids as vectors for mAb gene delivery has additional advantages including; (i) a strong safety profile in numerous clinical trials; (ii) the ability for re-dosing since DNA vectors are non-immunogenic, and (iii) the possibility for long-term gene expression even though DNA vectors do not integrate into cellular DNA. Synthetic DNA technology allows for manipulation of mAb sequences to improve in vivo expression levels and/or modify effector function(s) of the antibodies. We have demonstrated that delivery of dMAbs targeting Pseudomonas, Chikungunya, Dengue, and Influenza into mice produces biologically relevant mAb serum levels that can protect animals from challenge by each pathogen.17\u201320 Additionally, dMAbs can be co-delivered with DNA vaccines to provide immediate protection during the eclipse period when conventional vaccine-induced immunity is developing.19",

The genetic sequences of the anti-ZIKV mAbs were modified to synthetically produce human IgGs while retaining each mAb\u2019s complementarity-determining region (CDR). The genetic sequences were optimized to improve protein translation and then cloned into DNA vectors. The dMAb plasmids were shown to direct production of ZIKV-specific antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Mice administered ZIKV-dMAb plasmids were protected from morbidity and mortality after challenge with a contemporary clinical ZIKV strain. Most importantly, the dMAb plasmids provide immediate protection from ZIKV which could be co-administered with a ZIKV DNA vaccine to provide comprehensive protection from ZIKV during the eclipse period of the vaccine-induced immune responses. The anti-ZIKV mAbs described here may be useful in providing protection against this rapidly emerging virus.",

Passive antibodies may have value in therapy of infected persons to lower viral load as well as in rapid protection strategies to protect at risk women of childbearing years or the immune compromised. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of several infectious diseases as well as in preliminary in vitro and in vivo models of flavivirus-related infections.25,26,28 Given their specific antiviral activity as being well-tolerated molecules with limited side effects, mAbs could represent a new therapeutic approach for the development of an effective treatment, as well as useful tools in the study of the host-virus interplay and in the development of more effective immunogens.",

Spleen and whole blood mononuclear cells were harvested from the macaques 15 d-post re-challenge.

RT-PCR to amplify variable heavy (VH), variable kappa (V\u03ba), and variable lambda (V\u03bb) gene segments was performed separately on peripheral blood RNA and splenic RNA, and then VHs, V\u03bas, and V\u03bbs from each source of RNA were pooled. RT-PCR was performed as described21\u201323 using a combination of human immunoglobulin primers previously described and supplemented with sets of macaque-specific VH, V\u03ba, and V\u03bb as summarized in supplementary data Table 1.

We have previously reported on the effectiveness of a DNA vaccine containing a novel consensus prME ZIKV antigen in inducing protective humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, NHPs12 and humans.27 As with most vaccines, optimal levels of protective immune responses are not achieved until at least a week post administration, and often, one or two boosting immunizations are needed to achieve durable, protective responses. In an outbreak situation, it is imperative to get health-care professionals and other personnel to hot zones rapidly, and often before they can receive a boost of any vaccine available to protect them from the threat.33 For these situations, we hypothesized that formulating a dMAb plasmid with a DNA vaccine could create a novel field strategy capable of providing both immediate and persistent protective responses against a pathogen. DNA is a useful vector for this strategy as it is non-immunogenic and allows for multiple administrations without loss of potency.17,19 For this study, we injected groups of A129 mice intramuscularly + EP with ZIKV DNA vaccine plasmid co-formulated with mouse-derived- or RhMac-derived- anti-ZIKV dMAb plasmids as described in Figure 6a. Half of the mice in each group were challenged with 106 PFU of ZIKV PR209 2 d later (D 2) while the other half in each group were challenged 3 weeks after the first immunization (D 21). As expected, ZIKV challenge of vaccine+dMAb groups conducted 2 d post the first vaccine+dMAb injection was able to protect the mice from morbidity and mortality (90% protection). The other half of each group that were challenged 3 weeks post the initial injection conferred 100% protection from ZIKV morbidity and mortality (Figure 6b,c). These results indicate that neither the mouse nor RhMac ZIKV dMAbs interfered with the induction of immune responses by the ZIKV DNA vaccine-making co-administration of these plasmids a viable strategy for providing immediate and persistent protection from ZIKV.",

Current ZIKV vaccine platforms utilize various modalities including nucleic acids (both DNA and mRNA); purified, inactivated whole virus vaccines (PIV); viral-vectored vaccines; subunit proteins-virus-like particles (VLPs); and live-attenuated vaccines. Developing ZIKV vaccines based on a single strain of virus is feasible because the two genetic lineages of ZIKV, African and Asian/American, have limited variability.36 As for ZIKV therapeutics, anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies for both prophylaxis and treatment have been developed including the EDIII-specific ZKA190 clone which is broadly neutralizing and the ZIKV-117 clone that reduces infection in pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Small molecule antiviral agents have been tested that limit ZIKV infection in various ways including nucleoside analogs, peptidomimetic agents, adenosine analogs, antimalarials, anthelmintics, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDK).37 With both ZIKV vaccines and therapeutics for prophylactic and therapeutic usages, one of the biggest hurdles in advancing agents to the clinic has been the selection of the most suitable clinical endpoint.37 Given the endemic potential of ZIKV encompassing several continents and the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, it is difficult to discern a na\u00efve population without extensive laboratory testing. Ethical considerations for the inclusion of pregnant women and their safety related to ZIKV-related neurological complications, notably microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, have also hindered the clinical evaluation of ZIKV vaccines and therapeutics.",

To improve expression levels in vivo, changes in dMAb plasmid formulation are being explored along with two-plasmid strategies where the heavy and light chains of each antibody are delivered on separate plasmids. DNA plasmids co-formulated with hyaluronidase have been shown to increase in vivo expression.20,39,40 Despite variable expression levels, the ability of the different antibodies to bind to ZIKV envelope is similar at normalized serum concentrations. An area of concern for antibody therapies for flaviviruses, particularly dengue virus, is the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection where sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies can mediate greater levels of infection by allowing uptake of virus into cells expressing the Fc receptor. There are findings that cross-reactive dengue virus mAbs can exacerbate ZIKV infection of placental macrophages using Hoffbauer cells.41 However, such effects had not been strongly demonstrated so far with ZIKV mAbs and increased ZIKV infections.

Monoclonal antibodies binding to ZIKV-NS1 region may confer advantages during an active viral replication phase of ZIKV infection, whereas clones that bind to ZIKV capsid anchor (Ca) region may block proper virion assembly as the cis-binding of Ca with PrM is strictly required to produce infectious particles.42 Broadly neutralizing capability of these anti-ZIKV clones has not been evaluated in this study since the dMAb-administered animals were challenged with a single strain of ZIKV-PR209. Despite the limitations in study designs, ZIKV has limited strain variability in which the African and Asian/American lineages are classified as a single serotype.36 ZIKV-PR209 is of the Asian/American lineage and one of the most virulent strains of wild-type ZIKV in recent years, which has been used in numerous published studies to test neutralization and in animal challenges to validate therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy of ZIKV agents.12,27,44 Moreover, sequence alignments of 58 complete ZIKV genome and 5 ZIKV envelope sequences compiled as of April 2016 show highly conserved amino acid variations and only eight variation sites in the envelope region.45",

A129 mice of 3\u20136 weeks of age and mixed gender were immunized with 25\u03bcg of pVax1 vector or ZIKV prME1 DNA vaccine i.m. in the left tibialis anterior muscle, and 100\u03bcg of pVax1 vector or the ZIKV dMAb plasmids i.m. in the right tibialis anterior muscle, as both injections were followed by CELLECTRA\u00ae enhanced electroporation delivery (n= 24, n= 12 for pVax1+ pVax1 group, n= 12 for prME1+ ZIKV dMAb group). Six mice from each group were challenged with 105 PFU of ZIKV PR209 2 d post DNA vaccine + ZIKV-dMAb combination. These remaining 12 mice were challenged with 106 PFU of ZIKV PR209 at 3 weeks after the first immunization. A combination immunotherapy of ZIKV DNA vaccine plus a ZIKV dMAb selected from mouse-derived clones (b) and rhesus macaque (RhMac)-derived clones (c). ZIKV dMAb clones of both origins confer protection in mice from an acute and prolonged challenge. The top and bottom left graphs refer to the ZIKV challenge 2 d post the first combination immunotherapy (vaccine+dMAb), where the top indicates a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the bottom indicates percent body weight change over time. The top and bottom right graphs refer to the ZIKV challenge 3 weeks post the initial vaccine+dMAb administration, where the top graph indicates a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the bottom graph charting percent body weight change over time.",
