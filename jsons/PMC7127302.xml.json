The first model takes advantage of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain 31 and the BB rat 32, 33, both of which spontaneously develop type I diabetes. Infection of either animal with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) reduces the incidence of diabetes compared with sham-infected animals. In this work 31, 32, 33, it was shown that both insulitis and the normally elevated levels of insulin in the urine were markedly reduced. This was one of the first models to demonstrate that virus infections can protect against autoimmune disease. More recently, another group injected NOD mice with CpG-containing oligonucleotides or plasmid DNA containing CpG motifs and were also able to modulate diabetes 34. The mechanism of inhibition and actual viral infection is probably similar, and will be discussed later.",

In EAE, animals are sensitized with myelin, myelin proteins such as MBP or PLP, or encephalitogenic peptides (derived from the myelin proteins) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), which potentiates immune responses. Animals can develop a relapsing\u2013remitting clinical disease with CNS lesions similar to the acute inflammatory lesions seen in MS patients 35. Infection with a recombinant vaccina virus can protect mice from EAE. This model takes advantage of molecular mimicry 36, 37 as the recombinant virus shares an immunological determinant with a host CNS protein (Fig. 1\n). Molecular mimicry occurs when a microorganism and its host share an immunological epitope; the epitope can be a similar amino acid sequence or a comparable conformational determinant. An immune response induced by infection with a virus having a cross-reactive determinant also recognizes the similar host epitope. Another example of this is the cross-reaction between the M protein of Streptococcus and heart myosin \u2013 infection with certain strains of Streptococcus can lead to myocarditis owing to a cross-reacting immune response (reviewed in Refs 38, 39).",

            "text": "Mice were vaccinated with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding an encephalitogenic epitope of MBP (Ref. 40). This infection alone did not cause autoimmune CNS disease. When these vaccinated mice were sensitized with the same encephalitogenic peptide or the entire MBP, they did not develop the symptoms or pathological changes of EAE (Ref. 40), whereas non-vaccinated mice and mice vaccinated with a control virus did develop EAE. Vaccinated mice had decreased lymphoproliferative and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to MBP. CD4+ T cells from these animals could not adoptively transfer EAE to naive mice, whereas T cells from mice infected with the control virus (vaccinia virus encoding \u03b2-galactosidase, VVSC11) could transfer disease. It is likely that recombinant vaccina virus can protect from EAE because acetylation of the first amino acid is important for the ability of this peptide to induce EAE (Ref. 41), and in the virus-encoded MBP peptide this residue is not acetylated. The recombinant virus presents an altered peptide ligand to the mouse, resulting in protection from autoimmune disease 42, 43, 44. It should be noted that another possible explanation is that T cells specific for the cross-reacting epitope were inappropriately stimulated during infection leading to anergy or unresponsiveness owing to activation-induced cell death 45. However, when taken together, these data indicate that viral infections can protect individuals against autoimmune disease; the types of infections described above might explain the paucity of MS observed in the equatorial regions of the world.",

Two laboratories have developed an interesting model involving transgenic mice encoding the LCMV glycoprotein (GP) or nucleoprotein (NP) 46, 47. The viral gene is under the control of the rat insulin promoter; the viral protein is therefore expressed in the pancreas and, because it is present in the mouse from inception, it is considered to be a \u2018self\u2019 protein. When mice are infected with LCMV, they develop diabetes and this LCMV infection also generates an immune response to the \u2018self\u2019 LCMV GP or NP present in the pancreas. Thus, the murine immune system is fooled into attacking a self protein present in the pancreas. The effector cell in this model is the CD8+ T cell 48. A class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) blocking peptide can inhibit the CD8+ T cells from mediating diabetes 49, 50.",

If the \u2018self\u2019 (LCMV) protein is expressed in the thymus as well as the pancreas, CD4+ T cells are required to expand and activate the CD8 population sufficiently to induce overt disease 51. The hypothesis here is that an individual becomes infected very early in life with a virus having a specific tropism for an organ such as the pancreas or brain and this virus then persists in that organ. A later infection, with the same virus or a related virus having a similar epitope, leads to immune-mediated attack of virus-infected cells in that organ. Periodic infections with the same or related viruses could lead to increased damage and frank clinical disease. A similar scenario could occur if animals were infected with a virus having molecular mimicry with a pancreatic epitope. The immune-mediated damage could in itself result in sufficient tissue destruction to cause functional disease (i.e. diabetes) or immune-mediated attack of the target cells could release other self antigens. The release of other self antigens in this inflammatory milieu would lead to the presentation of additional self peptides to the immune system, initiating an autoimmune response different from that of the original inciting self determinant. This is often referred to as determinant or epitope spreading 52.",

In the proteasome, proteins are degraded into peptides and can be presented on the cell surface by MHC molecules to T cells, which recognize viral peptides presented in association with MHC molecules. Ubiquitination of PLP targets it to the proteasome 54. Three-week-old female SJL/J mice were injected with a cDNA construct encoding ubiquitinated PLP (pUPLP) 55. Injection of young mice with pUPLP leads to the synthesis of PLP within cells, with PLP degradation via proteasomes (similar to an infection with a virus sharing cross-reacting epitopes with PLP) occurring early in life. The mice were rested and then challenged with a non-specific immunological stimulus (the adjuvant CFA). Interestingly, 20% of the mice developed EAE. One interpretation of these data is that viruses having molecular mimicry with self CNS proteins could prime mice for disease early in life and a non-specific immunological challenge such as an infection could initiate or exacerbate disease at a later time. To further test this hypothesis, mice were inoculated with pUPLP and rested; they were then infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding \u03b2-galactosidase, an antigen that does not cross-react with any CNS protein, instead of being given CFA as a non-specific challenge. Again, 20% of these mice developed CNS inflammatory lesions. Therefore, a non-specific virus infection could replace CFA as an immunological stimulus. As a corollary to these experiments, mice were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding PLP (VVPLP), rested and then given CFA as an immunological stimulus. The majority of mice developed inflammatory lesions within the CNS. Under these conditions, viruses encoding cross-reacting epitopes could silently prime mice for autoimmune disease and, at a later time, a viral infection could exacerbate the disease 55. This could explain why no virus has been identified as the causative agent in many autoimmune diseases such as MS and why infections are often seen in temporal association with attacks.",

The production of type 1 IFNs downregulates the production of interleukin (IL)-12 by monocytes and dendritic cells 56. In many experimental models of autoimmune disease, IL-12 exacerbates disease. For example, IL-12 can exacerbate diabetes when given to NOD mice 57. Similarly, IL-12 can initiate an attack of EAE (Ref. 58). Therefore, IL-12 plays an important role in the expansion and activation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Thus, in the NOD\u2013LCMV model, where viruses have a beneficial effect, we propose that the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 by infection results in the downregulation of IL-12, leading to a decrease in spontaneous disease.",

            "text": "In the experimental model where viruses with molecular mimicry to CNS proteins can prime mice for autoimmune disease, and a non-specific immunological challenge can exacerbate disease, we predict that certain kinds of viral infections \u2013 those that produce very little type 1 IFN and enhance IL-12 production \u2013 could exacerbate autoimmune disease (Fig. 2\n). Interestingly, viruses that stimulate the production of IL-12, including herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, influenza virus and coronavirus 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, have been isolated from or been associated with exacerbation of MS (Refs 25, 68). Virus-stimulated IL-12 production could lead to early NK cell activation. These NK cells produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b3 (Refs 69, 70). IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 have been shown to be two prerequisites for the activation of CD4+ T cells 71, 72. If autoreactive CD4+ T cells have been previously expanded by virus infections having molecular mimicry with self CNS proteins, then infections with one of the viruses that induce high levels of IL-12 could now lead to further expansion of the autoreactive cells. Having these cells above a certain threshold could manifest as autoimmune disease.",

By contrast, other viruses induce the production of IL-12, which in turn can activate natural killer (NK) cells.
