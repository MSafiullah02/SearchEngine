The estimate of up to 38% absenteeism for avian influenza virus is alarmingly high as the H5N1 virus has never been transmitted from patients to health-care workers. 25 We felt that the disproportionate concern among staff most likely relates to avian influenza's considerable and often dramatic media profile. 1 For a pandemic influenza threat, the absentee rate of up to 53% is comparable to prior international findings for an equally threatening infectious and transmissible biological hazard. 11,12 This high predicted absentee rate is less surprising as 21% of SARS victims worldwide were health-care staff. However, transmission of the SARS virus was found to be most likely because of lack of basic preventative measures. 30 We felt that respondents in our survey did not fully appreciate the effectiveness of basic preventative measures. During the SARS epidemic, hospital staff in Toronto and Singapore needed specific education to develop a positive view on the effectiveness of basic protective measures in preventing further transmission of the SARS virus. 3, 30, 31 Previous research has shown that in the face of perceived risks to personal health, willingness to attend work was higher in medical and nursing staff than in support staff. 5, 12 Our study did not find such a difference, but along similar lines, we found that staff working in areas likely to be directly responsible for the care of influenza patients (i.e. emergency and acute medical wards) were more likely to report for duty, despite the higher risk of exposure to the virus. This finding was the same for both clinical and non-clinical support staff. This is consistent with research demonstrating that staff are more willing to attend work if they perceive their role to be central and important in the response to a public health threat. 5, 12, 13 Along similar lines, full-time employees were less likely to be absent, which might reflect either greater job commitment or job dependency compared with part-time workers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 178, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 298, "end": 300, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 460, "end": 463, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 464, "end": 466, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 505, "end": 508, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 509, "end": 511, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 669, "end": 671, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 991, "end": 993, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1137, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1557, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1897, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1901, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1904, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2081, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2084, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2651, "end": 2653, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2654, "end": 2657, "text": "12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2658, "end": 2660, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The corollary of the above finding is that other hospital services not directly related to treatment of influenza patients might deteriorate, compounding the surge-capacity situation and hospital crisis. 32 Particular attention should therefore be focused on minimizing absenteeism of staff in these departments (e.g. pathology, pharmacy, allied health and non-acute medical and surgical wards).

This overestimation of mortality rate, together with the expected high absentee rates for both scenarios, strongly suggests that the perceived risk (rather than actual risk) is an important determinant of work attendance.
