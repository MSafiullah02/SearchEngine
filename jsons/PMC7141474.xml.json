The greater risk, however, may be to the employees\u2019 health and the health of the broader community. We are all human, and we cannot help but consider the financial strain on everyone in the practice. However, when money drives the decision process, ethics often will be compromised. The compelling ethical obligation to \u201cact for the benefit of others\u201d (the principle of Beneficence)1 should be the priority, which may mean temporarily limiting service. We are all at risk, and we must all act with concern for one another to mitigate the damage in the most humane way.
