U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative defines nanoparticles (NPs) in the range 1\u2013100 nm (National Nanotechnology Initiative 2008). Microbial, fungal, and viral infections represent an increasing worldwide threat that is caused by both general immunosuppression of the world population and the growth of resistance of pathogens to clinically used drugs as well as development of cross-resistant or multidrug-resistant strains (Jamp\u00edlek 2018). In particular, viruses caused a number of diseases worldwide, many of them with fatal termination. Although smallpox has been eradicated and for some of them vaccines were developed, viruses continuously indicate to us that conventional antiviral drugs/strategies directly targeting viral or cellular proteins have been limited, due to frequent virus variation resulting in drug resistance, because many of drugs show high specificity (e.g., De Clercq and Li 2016; Takizawa and Yamasaki 2018; Wang et al. 2018a; Deng and Wang 2018). It can be stated that design and discovery of structurally new anti-infectives with a new/innovative mode of action is time consuming and relatively risky (Jamp\u00edlek 2016a, b, 2018). Moreover, many of the existing antivirals demonstrate also human toxicity and rapid clearance from the body. Thus, design and development of new safe and potent antivirals with activity against viral infection at multiple points in the viral life cycle remains a major challenge (Al-Ghananeem et al. 2013; Li et al. 2016; Kos et al. 2019).",

In fact, this strategy is not only used for anti-infectious drugs but nanoformulations are also widely used for different classes of drugs, such as antineoplastics (Pentak et al. 2016; Jamp\u00edlek and Kr\u00e1\u013eov\u00e1 2019a), antipsychotics, antidepressants (Jamp\u00edlek and Kr\u00e1\u013eov\u00e1 2019b, c), and nootropics (Jamp\u00edlek et al. 2015). Nanoscale dimension significantly modifies properties and behavior of all materials (e.g., Dolez 2015), whereby to benefits of pharmaceutical and medical nanoformulations belong primarily sustainable release of drugs, modifications of bioavailability, reduction of the required drug amount, reduction of toxicity of drugs, as well as increasing drug stability (e.g., Jamp\u00edlek and Kr\u00e1\u013eov\u00e1 2018; Patra et al. 2018). Thus in the light of the above mentioned facts, nanomaterials can constitute a useful tool in combat with viruses as well (Szunerits et al. 2015; Milovanovic et al. 2017; Siddiq et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2017; Zazo et al. 2017).",

Cagno et al. (2018) designed antiviral NPs having long and flexible linkers mimicking HS proteoglycans, allowing for effective viral association with a binding that was simulated to be strong and multivalent to the viral attachment ligand repeating units, generating forces that eventually lead to irreversible viral deformation and showing nanomolar irreversible activity against HSV, human papilloma virus, RSV, dengue virus , and lentivirus in vitro and were active ex vivo in human cervicovaginal histocultures infected by HSV-2 and in vivo in mice infected with RSV.

(2018) were able to multivalently interact with viral glycoproteins, shield virus surfaces, and efficiently block infection and were found to act as robust inhibitors for human viruses. Dendritic cells are crucial during development of T cell-specific responses against bacterial and viral pathogens.",

Ag nanocomplexes with anionic linear globular dendrimers that were assessed against HIV replication pathway in vitro showed also good ARV activity with nonsevere toxic effects in comparison with nevirapine as the standard drug in positive control group (Ardestani et al. 2015). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs were found to be a promising microbicidal candidate for use in topical vaginal/cervical agents to prevent HIV-1 transmission (Lara et al. 2010). Inactivation of microbial infectiousness by AgNPs-coated condom as a new approach to inhibit HIV- and HSV-transmitted infection was proposed by Fayaz et al. (2012). At treatment of HIV-1 infected cells with curcumin-stabilized AgNPs of 45 nm reduced replication of HIV by inhibition of NF-B nuclear translocation and the downstream expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-6 was estimated and no similar biological effects were observed with curcumin alone and conventional AgNPs capped with citric acid (Sharma et al. 2017a). Stable and crystalline AgNPs fabricated using the aqueous leaf extract of mangrove (Rhizophora lamarckii) with particle sizes ranging from 12 to 28 nm inhibited HIV type 1 reverse transcriptase activity (IC50 of 0.4 \u03bcg/mL on the HIV-1) showing the promising potential to be used in the fight against HIV and other viruses of public health importance (Kumar et al. 2017a). AuNPs capped with sulfate-ended ligands that are able to bind HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and inhibit in vitro the HIV infection of T cells at nanomolar concentrations were reported by Di Gianvincenzo et al. (2010). AuNPs inhibiting HIV entry by binding with gp120 and preventing CD4 attachment were described by Vijayakumar and Ganesan (2012). HIV-1 peptides loaded onto AuNPs bearing high-mannoside-type oligosaccharides increased HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation and induced highly functional cytokine secretion compared with HIV peptides alone and elicited a highly efficient secretion of pro-Th1 cytokines and chemokines, a moderate production of pro-Th2, and considerably higher secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, suggesting that AuNPs that could simultaneously deliver HIV-1 antigens and high-mannoside-type oligosaccharides could be utilized as a superb vaccine delivery system (Climent et al. 2018).",

For example, tenofovir (TFV) alafenamide and elvitegravir (EVG) loaded NPs subcutaneously administered to female humanized CD34+-NSG mice showed long residence time and exposure for both drugs. The AUC(0\u201314 day) estimated for TFV and EVG using NPs was 23.1 \u00b1 4.4 and 39.7 \u00b1 6.7 \u03bcg h/mL, while with application of drug solutions the observed AUC(0\u201372 h) reached 14.1 \u00b1 2.0 and 7.2 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcg h/mL, respectively. Similarly, application of NPs resulted in strong increase of elimination half-life (t1/2) that was 5.1 and 3.3 days for TFV and EVG, respectively, while the corresponding t1/2 values for free drugs were 14.2 and 10.8 h (Prathipati et al. 2017).",

(2015) incorporated ARV drugs maraviroc, etravirine, and raltegravir into poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) NPs and found that ARV NPs maintained potent HIV inhibition and were more effective, when used in combinations. Significantly higher antiviral potency and dose-dependent reduction against both cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 BaL infection in vitro was estimated mainly for ARV NPs combinations involving etravirine NPs, whereby the combinations that showed large dose-reduction were identified to be synergistic. Moreover, ARV NPs combinations inhibited propagation of reverse transcriptase in simian-human immunodeficiency viruses in macaque cervicovaginal tissue and blocked virus transmission by migratory cells emigrating from the tissue. PGLA NPs were also used as a biodegradable carrier for loading with TFV in combination with efavirenz or saquinavir, which resulted in pronounced combination drug effects, and emphasized the potential of NPs for the realization of unique drug-drug activities (Chaowanachan et al. 2013). TFV and EVG-loaded PLGA NPs tested using humanized BLT mouse model were reported to be suitable for long-acting prevention of HIV-1 vaginal transmission (Mandal et al. 2017a). In an in vitro HIV-1 inhibition study, the IC50 value observed with emtricitabine-loaded PLGA NPs (size of <200 nm and surface charge \u221223 mV) was found to be 43-fold lower in TZM-bl cells (0.00043 \u03bcg/mL) and approx. fourfold lower (0.009 \u03bcg/mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with drug solution (0.01861 and 0.033 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) and showed comparable activity with emtricitabine solution. Based on prolonged intracellular drug concentration and inhibition of HIV infection, the researchers noted that this long-acting, stable formulation could ensure once-biweekly dosing to prevent or treat HIV infection (Mandal et al. 2017b). PLGA-EVG NPs (~47 nm; zeta potential of approx. 6.74 mV) showed time- and concentration-dependent uptakes in monocytes with an approx. twofold higher drug intracellular internalization of EVG compared to free drug and also exhibited superior viral suppression over control for a prolonged period of time (Gong et al. 2017). Due to the presence of mannose receptors on the surface of macrophages, the mannosylated NPs of anti-HIV drug can target the macrophages, resulting in improvement of the therapeutic outcome and reduced toxicity of ARV bioactives. Surface-functionalized mannosylated-PLGA NPs of lamivudine (LVD) administered by intravenous route in a dose of 10 mg/kg to rats showed pronouncedly higher calculated brain/plasma ratio than PLGA NPs and continuously increased drug concentration up to 12 h (Patel et al. 2018). EFV-loaded PLGA NPs prepared using microfluidic method with particle size 73 nm, zeta potential \u221214.1 mV, and 10.8% drug loading showed a sustained in vitro EFV release (50% released within the first 24 h), and NPs functionalization with a transferrin receptor-binding peptide was found to be safe to blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial and neuron cells (metabolic activity above 70%) and nonhemolytic, whereby functionalized nanosystems exhibited 1.3-fold higher drug permeability through a BBB in vitro model compared to free drug (Martins et al. 2019). EFV-loaded PLGA NPs and PLGA NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating with particle sizes 200\u2013225 nm also retained native ARV activity of drug in vitro, while showed lower cytotoxicity against different epithelial cell lines and HIV target cells. Both types of NPs were readily taken up by colorectal cell lines and mildly reduced EFV permeation and increased membrane retention in Caco-2 and Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell models monolayer in vitro. At intrarectal administration to CD-1 mice in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), the coated PLGA NPs encapsulating EFV reached higher drug levels in colorectal tissues and lavages compared to free EFV or EFV-loaded PLGA NPs and they provided enhanced local pharmacokinetics that could be beneficial in preventing rectal HIV transmission (Nunes et al. 2018). TFV and EFV-loaded PLGA NPs incorporated alongside free TFV into fast dissolving films during film manufacturing showed higher retention in vivo in vaginal lavages and tissue when associated to film, and NPs-in-film were still able to enhance drug concentrations of EFV. Film alone also contributed to higher and more prolonged local drug levels as compared to the administration of TFV and EFV in aqueous vehicle, and once daily vaginal administration to mice of this formulation did not cause notable histological changes and major alterations in cytokine/chemokine profiles (Cunha-Reis et al. 2016).",

(2013) referred about the potential of nanoassemblied nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) delivered as squalenoylated prodrugs to enhance their absorption and improve their biodistribution and also to enhance their intracellular delivery and antiviral efficacy toward HIV-infected cells. Biodegradable cationic cholesterol-\u03b5-polylysine nanogel carriers for delivery of triphosphorylated NRTIs demonstrating high anti-HIV activity along with low neurotoxicity, warranting minimal side effects following systemic administration, were prepared by Warren et al. (2015). Nanogel modification with brain-specific peptide vectors resulted in efficient central nervous system targeting. Senanayake et al. (2015) conjugated succinate derivatives of NRTIs with cholesteryl-\u03b5-polylysine nanogels. Nanogel conjugates of zidovudine (ZDV), LVD, and abacavir demonstrated tenfold suppression of reverse transcriptase activity in HIV-infected macrophages with EC90 drug levels of 2\u201310, 2\u20134, and 1\u20132 \u03bcM, respectively, for single nanodrugs and dual and triple nanodrug cocktails, conjugate of LVD being the most effective single nanodrugs (EC90 2 \u03bcM). NPs of 50\u201360 nm prepared by encapsulation of ZDV in lactoferrin NPs were found to be stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids and the anti-HIV-1 activity of drug remained unaltered in nanoformulation in acute infection, the drug release from NPs was constant up to 96 h and bone marrow micronucleus assay showed that nanoformulation exhibited ca. twofold lower toxicity than soluble form (Kumar et al. 2015). Lactoferrin NPs loaded with a triple drug combination of ZDV, EFV, and LVD showing a diameter of 67 nm and EE >58% for each drug delivered the maximum of its payload at pH 5 with a minimum burst release in vitro, exhibited improved anti-HIV activity, were practically not toxic to the erythrocytes, and reached in in vivo experiment an approx. >4-fold increase in AUC, 30% increase in the Cmax compared to individual drugs, and >2-fold enhancement in the half-life of each drug. They also showed improved bioavailability of all drugs with less tissue-related inflammation (Kumar et al. 2017b). Improved HIV-microbicide activity through the co-encapsulation of drugs acting as NRTIs in biocompatible metal organic framework nanocarriers containing iron(III) polycarboxylate NPs was reported by Marcos-Almaraz et al.

Viruses of influenza A type occur in humans and animals, while types B and C can be found only in humans. Influenza A viruses are classified according to the type of hemagglutinin (H) and the type of neuroaminidase (N) into subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, and H8N4. Each virus subtype has mutated into a variety of strains with differing pathogenic profiles using humanized BLT mouse model (Taubenberger and Morens 2010; Takizawa and Yamasaki 2018). Influenza A virus causes influenza in birds and some mammals, and is the only species of the Alphainfluenzavirus genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Type A influenza is a contagious viral infection that can have life-threatening complications if left untreated. An influenza could be pandemic, when an epidemic of an influenza virus spreads on a worldwide scale, e.g., \u201cSpanish flu\u201d of 1918 (Kuchipudi and Niessly 2018).",

The effect of size dependence of the AgNPs (3.5, 6.5, and 12.9 nm average diameters) that were embedded into the CS matrix on antiviral activity against H1N1 influenza A virus was also observed showing generally stronger antiviral activity with smaller AgNPs in the composites (Mori et al. 2013). Evaluation of the efficacy of AgNP-decorated silica hybrid composite (Ag30-SiO2) with particle size of 400 nm in diameter for inactivation of influenza A virus showed that even after 1 h of exposure to these NPs >80% of HA damage, 20% of neuraminidase activities, and reduction of the infection caused by the virus in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells was observed.

            "text": "As the primary mechanism of influenza virus inhibition by AuNPs with different anionic groups blocking of viral attachment to cell surface was suggested, although viral fusion inhibition could not be excluded (Sametband et al. 2011). Li et al. (2016) proposed a new modality to inhibit viral infection by fabricating DNA-conjugated AuNPs networks on cell membranes as a protective barrier, antiviral activity of which may be attributed to steric effects, the disruption of membrane glycoproteins, and limited fusion of cell membrane bilayers. In addition, these DNA-AuNPs beside inhibition of virus attachment and entry could also inhibit viral budding and cell-to-cell spread. Multivalent sialic acid-functionalized AuNPs of 14 nm inhibited influenza virus infection. As the binding of the viral fusion protein HA to the host cell surface is mediated by sialic acid receptors, a multivalent interaction with sialic acid-functionalized AuNPs is expected to competitively inhibit viral infection (Papp et al. 2010). Intranasal immunizations with a mixture of conjugated recombinant trimetric influenza A/Aichi/2/68(H3N2) HA onto functionalized AuNPs surfaces in a repetitive, oriented configuration and AuNPs coupled with Toll-like receptor 5 agonist flagellin as particulate adjuvants resulted in improved mucosal B cell responses (increasing influenza-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG l in nasal, tracheal, and lung washes), stimulation of antigen-specific interferon-\u03b3-secreting CD4+ cell proliferation and induced strong effector CD8+ T cell activation suggesting powerful mucosal and systemic immune responses protecting hosts against lethal influenza challenges (Wang et al. 2018b).",

HAI-positive and HAI-negative neutralizing monoclonal antibodies derived from mice immunized with NIV were active against homologous and drifted influenza A (H3N2) strains (Smith et al. 2017). Layered protein NPs composed of structure-stabilized HA stalk domains from both HA groups, and constructed M2e, were reported to have potential to be developed into a universal influenza vaccine that could induce broad cross protection against divergent viruses (Deng et al. 2018a).",

Serum samples collected from immunized chickens with formulation consisting of plasmid encoding HA gene of AIV, (A/Ck/Malaysia/5858/04 (H5N1)), formulated using biosynthesized AgNPs (4\u201318 nm) and PEG showed rapidly increasing antibody responses against H5 on day 14 after immunization and single oral administration of this formulation resulted in the induction of both the antibody and cell-mediated immune responses as well as enhanced cytokine production (Jazayeri et al. 2012). A vaccine formulation consisting of ion channel membrane matrix protein 2 of the extracellular domain of influenza A conjugated to AuNPs with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide as a soluble adjuvant, which was delivered intranasally in mice, resulted in lung B cell activation and robust serum anti-M2e IgG response, with stimulation of both IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes. Lethal challenge of vaccinated mice with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1pdm) pandemic strain, A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2), and the highly pathogenic AIV A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) resulted in 100, 92, and 100% protection (Tao et al. 2017). Considering a very important role of mucosal immunity in the antiviral immune response, AgNPs biofabricated using Cinnamomum cassia extract showed enhanced antiviral activity against highly pathogenic AIV subtype H7N3, when incubated with the virus prior to infection as well as introduced to cells after infection, whereby the tested concentrations of extract and AgNPs (up to 500 \u03bcg/mL) were found to be nontoxic to Vero cells (Fatima et al. 2016). For complexity, it is necessary to mention (as was discussed above) that Fujimori et al. (2012) described antiviral activity of CuI NPs against influenza A virus of swine origin H1N1.",

Similarly, nonencapsulated CpG 2007 in inactivated AIV vaccines administered by the intramuscular route generated higher antibody responses compared to the CpG 2007 encapsulated in PLGA, while PLGA-encapsulated CpG 2007 in AIV vaccines administered by the aerosol route elicited higher mucosal responses compared to nonencapsulated CpG 2007 (Singh et al. 2016b). Seok et al. (2017) designed an intradermal pH1N1 DNA vaccine delivery platform using microneedles coated with a polyplex-containing PLGA/polyethyleneimine NPs inducing a greater humoral immune response due to rapid dissolution of the coated polyplex in porcine skin (within 5 min) than that observed at intramuscular polyplex delivery or naked pH1N1 DNA vaccine delivery by a dry-coated microneedles. Consequently, intradermal delivery of DNA vaccines within a cationic polyplex coated on microneedles has potential in skin immunizations. Polyanhydride NPs encapsulating subunit proteins can enhance humoral and cell-mediated immunity and provide protection upon lethal challenge. A robust immunogen, recombinant H5 hemagglutinin trimer (H53) encapsulated into polyanhydride NPs used to immunizing mice induced high neutralizing antibody titers and enhanced CD4+ T cell recall responses in mice and H53-based polyanhydride nanovaccine induced protective immunity against a low-pathogenic H5N1 viral challenge (Ross et al. 2015). Similarly, intranasal delivery of nanovaccine consisting of inactivated SwIV encapsulated in polyanhydride NPs enhanced antigen-specific cellular immune response in pigs, with promise to induce cross-protective immunity (Dhakal et al. 2017a), and inactivated SwIV encapsulated in PLGA NPs (200\u2013300 nm diameter) administered via intranasal route reduced the clinical disease and induced cross-protective cell-mediated immune response in a pig model as well (Dhakal et al. 2017b).",

Curcumin-modified AgNPs showed strong inhibitory activity against RSV infection resulting in a reduction of viral titers about two orders of magnitude at AgNPs concentration showing no toxicity to the host cells, whereby AgNPs inactivated the virus directly, which resulted in the prevention of RSV to infect the host cells (Yang et al. 2016a).",

(2013). AgNPs applied at nontoxic concentrations administered prior to viral infection or soon after initial virus exposure were capable to inhibit HSV-2 replication, suggesting that the AgNPs acted during the early phases of viral replication (Hu et al. 2014). Tannic acid-modified AgNPs of 13, 33, and 46 nm showed antiviral activity and reduced both infection and inflammatory reaction in the mouse model of HSV-2 infection, when used at infection or for a postinfection treatment (Orlowski et al. 2014), and antiviral activity of such NPs with a size of 33 nm applied upon the mucosal tissues caused activation of immune response in vaginal HSV-2 (Orlowski et al. 2018a). Multifunctional tannic acid/AgNPs-based mucoadhesive hydrogel for effective vaginal treatment of HSV-2 genital infection was also reported (Szymanska et al. 2018). Investigation of the ability of tannic acid-modified Ag and Au NPs to induce dendritic cells maturation and activation in the presence of HSV-2 antigens, when used at nontoxic doses, showed that both types of these metal NPs were good activators of dendritic cells, albeit their final effect upon maturation and activation may be metal and size dependent and can help to overcome virus-induced suppression of dendritic cells activation (Orlowski et al. 2018b). AuNPs of the size of 7.86 nm surface-conjugated with gallic acid showed the antiviral efficacy against HSV infections in Vero cells with EC50 of 32.3 \u03bcM in HSV-1 and 38.6 \u03bcM in HSV-2 (Haider et al. 2018). AuNPs capped with mercaptoethanesulfonate (MES) strongly inhibited HSV-1, whereby they interfered with viral attachment, entry, and cell-to-cell spread, thereby preventing subsequent viral infection in a multimodal manner (Baram-Pinto et al. 2010). However, the antiviral effect of MES-capped AgNPs against HSV-1 was found to be imparted by their multivalent nature and spatially directed MES on the surface (Baram-Pinto et al. 2009). An overview related to application of AgNPs in inhibition of HSV was presented by Akbarzadeh et al. (2018).",

It was found that the solution formula with CS or sodium alginate exhibited comparable immunogenic responses to alum-adjuvanted suspension and the triple adjuvant application (alum, CS, sodium alginate) resulted in considerably higher immunogenic response than controls.

Graphene can disrupt the C-terminal domain interface of VP40 hexamers being crucial in forming the Ebola viral matrix, suggesting that graphene or similar NPs-based solutions used as a disinfectant could notably reduce the spread of the disease and prevent an Ebola epidemic (Gc et al. 2017). Rodriguez-Perez et al. (2018) found that MWCNTs functionalized with glycofullerenes can be considered as potent inhibitors of Ebola infection. In two mRNA vaccines based on the EBOV envelope glycoprotein, differing by the nature of signal peptide for improved glycoprotein posttranslational translocation, the mRNAs were formulated with LNPs to facilitate delivery. Vaccination of guinea pigs induced EBOV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses and 100% survival after EBOV infection (Meyer et al. 2018). Adjuvant-free dendrimer NPs vaccine platform wherein antigens are encoded by encapsulated mRNA replicons, able to generate protective immunity against many lethal pathogen challenges, including H1N1 influenza, Toxoplasma gondii, and EBOV, that can be formed with multiple antigen-expressing replicons and could elicit both CD8+ T cell and antibody responses was designed by Chahal et al. (2016). Administration of siRNA encapsulated in LNPs able to target Sudan ebolavirus VP35 gene to rhesus monkeys receiving a lethal dose of the virus resulted in up to 100% survival and a reduction of viral replication (up to 4 log10) (Thi et al. 2016). Similar results were received with treatment of Ebola-virus-Makona-infected nonhuman primates following administration of siRNA encapsulated in LNPs suggesting the therapeutic potential of such nanoformulation in combating this lethal disease (Thi et al. 2015). Incorporation of Ebola DNA vaccine into PLGA-poly-l-lysine/poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid increased vaccine thermostability and immunogenicity compared to free vaccine and vaccination performed to skin using a microneedle patch produced stronger immune responses than intramuscular administration (Yang et al. 2017b).",

DENV is an arthropode-borne virus that includes four different serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) and spread by Aedes mosquitoes. Its presenting features may range from asymptomatic fever to dreaded complications such as hemorrhagic fever and shock and it is considered as a major global public health challenge in the tropic and subtropic nations (Hasan et al. 2016). To achieve durable protective immunity against all four serotypes DENV vaccines must induce balanced, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. A tetravalent DENV protein subunit vaccine, based on recombinant envelope protein (rE) adsorbed to the surface of PLGA NPs, was designed. Particulate rE induced higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to the soluble rE antigen alone and stimulated a more balanced serotype-specific antibody response to each DENV serotype compared to soluble antigens, suggesting that such vaccines might overcome unbalanced immunity observed for leading live attenuated vaccine candidates (Metz et al. 2018). AgNPs showed in vitro antiviral activity against dengue serotype DEN-2 infecting Vero cells and the activity of AgNPs against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti expressed by IC50 values ranged from 10.24 ppm (I instar larvae) to 21.17 ppm (pupae) (Sujitha et al. 2015). AgNPs biosynthesized using the aqueous extract of Bruguiera cylindrica leaves significantly inhibited the production of dengue viral envelope E protein in Vero cells and downregulated the expression of dengue viral E gene and they were found to be suitable for application at low doses to reduce larval and pupal population of Ae. aegypti, without detrimental effects of predation rates of mosquito predators, such as Carassius auratus (Murugan et al. 2015). Stabile AgNPs (particle size from 7 to 32 nm and zeta potential \u221215.58 mV) biosynthesized using silver nitrate and Carica papaya leaf extract demonstrated good binding affinity against dengue type 2 virus nonstructural protein 1 (Renganathan et al. 2019). Treatment with a hybrid consisting of AuNPs functionalized with domain III of envelope glycoprotein derived from serotype 2 of DENV (EDIII) resulted in a high level of antibody, which mediates serotype-specific neutralization of DENV in BALB/c mice, was found to be size-dependent and according to researchers the hybrid concept could also be adopted for the development of a tetravalent vaccine against four serotypes of DENV (Quach et al. 2018). It is important to note that good antiviral activity against dengue virus exhibited also SeNPs (Ramya et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is the focus of an ongoing pandemic and public health emergency and represents a public health threat due to its teratogenic nature causing microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers and association with the serious neurological condition Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults (Plourde and Bloch 2016). Haque et al. (2018) proposed strategies to design effective and safe vaccines against ZIKV, including Toll-like receptors based NPs vaccines. The development of biomimetic nanodecoy (ND) that traps ZIKV and inhibits ZIKV infection was suggested by Rao et al. (2019). The ND, which is composed of a gelatin nanoparticle core camouflaged by mosquito medium host cell membranes, effectively adsorbs ZIKV and inhibits ZIKV replication in ZIKV-susceptible cells. AgNPs fabricated using leaf extracts of Cleistanthus collinus (triangular and pentagonal shape with sizes 66.27\u201375.09 nm) and Strychnos nux-vomica (spherical and round shape with sizes 54.45\u201360.84 nm) can be applied as a natural biolarvicidal agent to vector control strategy as an eco-friendly approach to prohibit Zika, chikungunya, and dengue fever in the future (Jinu et al. 2018). Insecticidal AgNPs prepared using Suaeda maritima were found to be effective against the dengue vector Ae. aegypti as well (Suresh et al. 2018). Bacterial exopolysaccharide-coated ZnO NPs nanoparticles showed high antibiofilm activity and larvicidal toxicity against malaria and ZIKV vectors Anopheles stephensi and Ae. aegypti with 100% mortality against third instars mosquito larvae at very low doses, whereby in the midgut of treated mosquito larvae presence of damaged cells and tissues was observed (Abinaya et al. 2018). Promising toxic and repellent activity against ZIKV mosquito vectors showed also TiO2 NPs prepared using an extract of Argemone mexicana that were capped with poly(styrenesulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (Murugan et al. 2018). Nanoscale silicate platelets modified with anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate significantly suppressed the plaque-forming ability of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) at noncytotoxic concentrations and blocked infection with DENV and influenza A virus and also reduced the lethality of JEV and DENV infection in mouse challenge models (Liang et al. 2014).",
