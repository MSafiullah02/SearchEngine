In addition, as the emergence of COVID-19 affects the commodity markets in China and other regions in the world, the proliferation of COVID-19 has caused impacts of global crude oil demand. Since January 2020, the new coronavirus has affected China's crude oil demand to a certain extent. At the end of February, it further expanded to South Korea, Iran, Italy and other countries and regions. In addition, in March, the United States, Britain, Spain and other countries spread rapidly , which affected the global demand for crude oil and caused panic about the economic outlook of the global market. We note that the international benchmark Brent crude oil fell to its lowest level since 2002.",

The Johansen cointegration test was used to study the covariates between crude oil prices and corn, sorghum, sugar, soybean, soybean oil, and palm oil prices from 2003 to 2007 in [2] . The analysis showed no co-integration relationship over the entire sample period. However, analysis of the 2006-2007 sub-sample showed that soybean and corn prices were cointegrated with crude oil. Besides, Natanelov et al. [3] studied the co-movements between crude oil and agricultural commodities by Johansen cointegration, Threshold cointegration, and vector error correction model. Their results indicated that the relationship is a dynamic concept, and some economic and policy development may change the relationship between crude oil and agricultural commodities. Du et al. [4] studied the fluctuation relationship between international crude oil futures and corn, wheat futures markets from 1998 to 2009 by using stochastic volatility models. The models were estimated by using Bayesian analysis, Markov chains, and Monte Carlo methods. They found that crude oil futures and corn, wheat futures markets have significant volatility spillover effects after the second half of 2006, which has a huge connection with the rise of bioethanol fuel.",

Afterwards, Zhou [15] extended this method to analyze the cross-correlation analysis for two nonstationary series, which is the MF-DCCA [10, 16, 17] .

The reasons for our selection of these agricultural futures will be analyzed and explained in Section 4.2. Our sample data covers the period from 3 April, 2017 to 3, April, 2020. After eliminating the non-matching missing data, the time series of Brent Crude Oil consists of 776 observations, and the other time series length of four agricultural futures are 762, 761, 761, and 759, respectively. Based on the total data of Brent Crude, we interpolate the price time series of the other four agricultural futures, and the length of the series after interpolation are all equal to 776. The time series of daily closing prices of all the commodities are illustrated in Fig. 1 , the codes and exchange information of these commodities and their statistics are introduced in Table 1 . In addition, the sample for analyzing the impact of COVID-19 consist of two periods which are the period 1 before the emergence of COVID-19 and the period 2 after the emergence of COVID-19.

According to [8, 10] , we set the window scale s ranges from 50 to 200, the value of order q is q = \u221210, \u22129, . . . , 9, 10. As can be seen from Fig. 3 , for different q, all the fluctuation function F q (s) and the window scale s show a good power law relationship, i.e.,, there exist cross-correlation between Brent Crude Oil and all agricultural future markets. This shows that changes in the volatility of the agricultural future markets are not only affected by their own volatility, but also by the volatility of the Brent Crude Oil market. By fitting the loglog plots of fluctuation function ln(F q (s)) \u2212 ln(s) of the closing price sequence of crude oil and agricultural futures using least square method, the slope H xy (q) can be obtained in Fig. 4 . It can be seen from Fig. 4 that H xy (q) decreases with the increasing of q, which shows not fixed constants, indicating the cross-correlations of multifractality exist between the crude oil market and all the agricultural future markets. When q varies from \u221210 to 0, the decreasing rate of the Hurst exponent values of all series pairs are accelerated, indicating the H xy (q) reveals the small fluctuations. Otherwise, when q varies from 0 to 10, the decreasing rate of the Hurst exponents gradually slow down, suggesting the large fluctuations exist in the series pair. In addition, in Fig. 4 and Table 2 , we see that when q = 2, all H xy (q) are greater than 0.5, indicating that there is a longrange correlation between the time series of the Brent Crude market and all agricultural future markets, i.e., the fluctuations in the crude oil market will has an impact on the future returns of the selected agricultural future markets.",

            "text": "We envisage several reasons for the long-range correlation between crude oil and selected agricultural products. For sugar future, the medium between crude oil and the white sugar market is sugar-based ethanol, and a considerable portion of international sugar is used to produce ethanol. While ethanol is mainly used for fuel, the price of crude oil has a greater impact on the production and sales of fuel ethanol. When the price of crude oil is low, the market expects that the production and sales of fuel ethanol will decrease, companies will increase the sugar ratio, sugar supply tends to be loose, and the downward pressure on sugar prices will increase; when the price of crude oil is high, the market expected production and sales of fuel ethanol will increase, companies usually increase ethanol production, white sugar supply tends to be tight, and the upward momentum of sugar prices has increased. That is, crude oil regulates the supply and demand balance of sugar by affecting the production and sales of ethanol, therefore, crude oil has a cross-correlation on the sugar future market. Ethanol fuel is also a medium for wheat and crude oil. The new ethanol production line mainly uses wheat and barley. Ethanol can help people reduce their dependence on petroleum and is a renewable biofuel. The main link between crude oil and the cotton market is the chemical fiber. The main raw materials for the production of chemical fiber are PTA and MEG, and the final upstream raw material of the PTA and MEG is crude oil. Chemical fiber and cotton are mainly used to produce textile and apparel products, and the two categories have a strong substitution relationship. At last, the correlation between crude oil and orange juice price is also strong. We assume that crude oil has a greater impact on the transportation cost of orange juice, and large fluctuation in crude oil prices often change the sentiment of the entire commodity market, it is highly likely that orange juice price is affected by the sentiment of the entire commodity market and show a strong correlation with crude oil price.",

            "text": "In this section, we explore the impact of the emergence of COVID-19 on the crosscorrelations of multifractal characteristics between the Brent Crude Oil and agricultural future markets. COVID-19 began to appear in December 2019 and gradually showed a trend of pandemic. In this article, we choose December 1, 2019 as the cut-off point, and select two samples, one period of which is from July 30, 2019 to November 30, 2019, we call it Period 1, and the other period from December 1, 2019 to April 3, 2020, we call it Period 2. The closing price time series of Brent Crude and agricultural futures for period 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 7 . The statistics of the time series in two periods are illustrated in Table 3 . According to the length of each subsample, we set the scale s ranges from 5 to 15, the value of order q is q = \u221210, \u22129, . . . , 9, 10. As shown in Fig. 8 , all the H xy (q) in period 1 and 2 decrease with the increasing of q, showing the cross-correlations of multifractality exist between the crude oil market and all the agricultural future markets in both period 1 and 2. In addition, we see that H xy (q) decrease fast with q varies from \u221210 to 0, suggesting there exists small fluctuations, while large fluctuations exist in the series pair when 0 < q < 10. Futhermore, according to Table 4 , all the H xy (2) are larger than 0.5, implying that there exists strong positive persistence of cross-correlations between the time series of the Brent Crude market and all agricultural future markets in both period 1 and 2. Besides, we observe that in period 1, the persistence of series pair LCO-LWB is the strongest, meaning that the fluctuations in the crude oil market will has the greatest impact on the future returns of wheat future market. However, under the influence of COVID-19, the fluctuations in the crude oil market will has the greatest impact on the future returns of orange juice market since the persistence of series pair LCO-OJ is the largest. This may be due to the indirect effect of COVID-19 on transportation in orange juice transportation. Besides, all the H xy (2) in period 2 are larger than in period 1, indicating a stronger persistence under the influence of COVID-19. By comparing \u2206H xy (q) in Fig. 8 and Table 4 , in both period 1 and 2, \u2206H xy (q) of LCO-LSU is the largest, which imply the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and sugar future market is the strongest among other four agricultural future markets. In addition, the cross-correlations of all the agricultural futures increased in period 2 except the orange juice. The same conclusion can also be obtained by comparing the curvature of the curves in Fig. 9 and comparing \u2206\u03b1 xy in Fig. 10 and Table 4 . The experimental results show that COVID-19 has a great impact on the cross-correlation of multifractal property between crude oil and most selected agricultural future markets. ",

Firstly, DCCA coefficients were employed to test there exists cross-correlations between the time series of crude oil and agricultural futures. Afterwards, MF-DCCA approach was utilized to further analyze the cross-correlations between the Brent crude oil and agricultural futures. The computed \u2206H xy (q) and \u2206\u03b1 xy indicated that the time series pair LCO-LSU has the strongest cross-correlation. Besides, the sources of the cross-correlations were envisaged and discussed. We also analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and agricultural futures. The values of H xy (2) showed that the feature of positive persistence became stronger after the emergence of COVID-19, and \u2206H xy (q) and \u2206\u03b1 xy calculated in period 1 and 2 showed the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and sugar future market is the strongest. Furthermore, we observe that the cross-correlations of almost all the agricultural futures behave stronger in period 2 than that in period 1, which imply that COVID-19 has an impact on the crosscorrelation of multifractality between Brent Crude Oil and selected agricultural future markets.",
