The Black Deaths (probably bubonic plague) spread starting in 1346, first through Asia and moving across Europe repeatedly during the fourteenth century. The Black Death has been estimated to have caused the death of as much as one-third of the population of Europe between 1346 and 1350. The disease reappeared regularly in various regions of Europe for more than 300 years, a notable outbreak being that of the Great Plague of London of 1665\u20131666. It gradually withdrew from Europe afterwards.",

Even within the twenty-first century, we see that millions of people die of measles, respiratory infections, diarrhea, and more. Individuals still die in significant numbers from diseases that are no longer considered dangerous, diseases that are easily treated or that have been well managed by resource-rich societies or by nations that invest in public health and prevention systematically. Some highly prevalent old foes include malaria, typhus, cholera, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness, endemic diseases in many parts of the world; diseases that have a significant negative impact on the mean life span of a population as well as on the economy of afflicted countries due to their impact on the health of the population. The World Health Organization has estimated that in 2011 there were 1,400,000 deaths due to tuberculosis, 1,200,000 deaths due to HIV/AIDS, and 627,000 deaths due to malaria (but other sources have estimated the number of malaria deaths to be more than 1,000,000). In short, HIV, malaria, and TB account for at least 9,000 deaths each day. The impact of vaccines can be dramatic, for example, there were 2,600,000 deaths due to measles in 1980 but only 160,000 by 2011. The development and availability of the measles vaccine led to a reduction in the number of deaths due to this childhood disease of nearly 94%. \n",

            "text": "In order to describe a mathematical model for the spread of a communicable disease, it is necessary to make some assumptions about the means of spreading infection. The idea of invisible living creatures as agents of disease goes back at least to the writings of Aristotle (384\u2013322 bc). The existence of microorganisms was demonstrated by van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723) with the aid of the first microscopes. The first expression of the germ theory of disease by Jacob Henle (1809\u20131885) came in 1840 and was developed by Robert Koch (1843\u20131910), Joseph Lister (1827\u20131912), and Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131875) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The modern view is that many diseases are spread by contact through a virus or bacterium. We focus in this book on the problem of understanding the spread of disease at a population level. Similar modeling approaches can be used to study the dynamics of infection within a host for diseases including HIV. This area is the backbone of the field of mathematical and computational immunology and viral dynamics. An introduction to immunology may be found in the book by Nowak and May [67].",

It is worth noting that the foundations of the entire approach to epidemiology based on compartmental models were laid, not by mathematicians, but primarily by public health physicians such as Sir R.A. Ross, W.H. Hamer, A.G. McKendrick, and W.O. Kermack between 1900 and 1935. \n",

We will think of networks as bi-directional, with disease transmission possible in either direction along an edge. A brief taste of network models is given at the beginning of Chap. 10.1007/978-1-4939-9828-9_4.

In other words, we assume that a disease outbreak begins when a single infective transmits infection to all of the people with whom he or she is in contact. Our development via branching processes is along the lines of that of [26]. Another approach, using a contact network perspective taken in [20, 65, 66] begins with an infected edge, corresponding to a disease outbreak started by an infective individual who passes the infection on to only one contact. This approach is the one taken more commonly in studies of epidemics on networks. It is somewhat more complicated and leads to somewhat different results, although the methods are quite similar.",

The Reed\u2013Frost model was actually anticipated nearly 40 years earlier by P.D. En\u2019ko [30]. The work of En\u2019ko was brought to public attention much later by K. Dietz [28]. E.B. Wilson and M.H. Burke have given a description of Frost\u2019s 1928 lectures with a somewhat different derivation [78]. M. Greenwood introduced a somewhat different chain binomial model in 1931 [40]. The Reed\u2013Frost model has been used widely as a basic stochastic model and many extensions have been formulated. The book [25] by D.J. Daley and J. Gani contains an account of some of the more recent extensions. Also, a stochastic analogue of the Kermack\u2013McKendrick epidemic model has been described in [6].",

Age of infection reappeared in the study of HIV/AIDS, in which the infectivity of infected individuals is high for a brief period after becoming infected, then quite low for an extended period, possibly several years, before increasing rapidly with the onset of full-blown AIDS. Thus the age of infection described by Kermack and McKendrick for epidemics became very important in some endemic situations; see, for example, [74, 75]. Also, HIV/AIDS has pointed to the importance of immunological ideas in the analysis on the epidemiological level.",

There are seasonal outbreaks which may be closely related to the strain of the previous year, that is, modified by point mutations, or it may be less closely related or it may be unrelated. The level of relation of two strains, as measured by the response of hosts that have experienced a prior influenza infection, is what we refer to as strain cross-immunity. Cross-immunity measures the level of protection earned by individuals who were infected by a related strain in a previous year. Influenza models may consider the effect that a partially efficacious vaccination may have before an outbreak, as well as the role of antiviral treatment during an outbreak. Considering multiple modes of transmission is critical when the goal is to minimize the impact of a disease in a population. Cholera may be transmitted both by direct contact and by contact with pathogen shed by infectives. In tuberculosis some individuals progress rapidly to active tuberculosis, while others progress much more slowly. Also, active-tuberculosis individuals who fail to comply with long-term treatment schedules become prime candidates for the development of a drug-resistant strain. In HIV/AIDS, the infectivity of an individual depends strongly on the time since infection, while transmission depends on modes of transmission, mixing between individuals and more. In malaria, immunity against infection is boosted by exposure to infection or by genetics (sickle cell anemia).",

The analysis of a model for an endemic disease, carried out in Chap. 10.1007/978-1-4939-9828-9_3, begins with the search for equilibria, which are, by definition, constant solutions of the model. Usually there is a disease-free equilibrium and there are one or more endemic equilibria, with a positive number of infected individuals. The next step is to linearize about each equilibrium and determine the stability of each equilibrium. Usually, if the basic reproduction number is less than 1, the only equilibrium is the disease-free equilibrium and this equilibrium is asymptotically stable. If the basic reproduction number is greater than 1, the usual situation is that the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is asymptotically stable. This approach also covers diseases in which there is vertical transmission, which is direct transmission from mother to offspring at birth [19].",

Another possibility is that there is a unique endemic equilibrium but it is unstable. In this situation, there is often a Hopf bifurcation and an asymptotically stable periodic orbit around the endemic equilibrium. An example of such behavior may be found in an SIRS model, with a temporary immunity period of fixed length following recovery [51] and in an SV IR model [38].

In sexually transmitted diseases there is often a \u201ccore\u201d group of very active members who are responsible for most of the disease cases, and control measures aimed at this core group have been very effective in control [52]. In epidemics there are often \u201csuper-spreaders,\u201d who make many contacts and are instrumental in spreading disease and in general some members of the population make more contacts than others. Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4939-9828-9_5 deals with models for diseases with heterogeneous mixing and includes description of a general method (the next generation matrix) for determining the basic reproduction number for models with heterogeneous mixing. To model heterogeneity in mixing we may assume that the population is divided into subgroups with different activity levels. Formulation of models requires some assumptions about the mixing between subgroups. There have been many studies of mixing patterns in real populations, for example, [9, 10, 18, 37, 68].",

This would have predicted at least 30,000 cases of SARS in China during the first 4 months of the epidemic. In fact, there were fewer than 800 cases reported in this time. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the estimates were based on transmission data in hospitals and crowded apartment complexes or in the scaling of the model used to estimate parameters [24]. It was observed that there was intense activity in some locations and very little in others. This suggests that the actual reproduction number (averaged over the whole population) was much lower, perhaps in the range 1.2\u20131.6, and that heterogeneous mixing was a very important aspect of the epidemic.",
