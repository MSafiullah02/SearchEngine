For this reason, different antigens appear similar to the immune system, thereby challenging the theoretical specificity postulated by the clonal selection theory. To understand this issue, it is useful to distinguish between crossneutralization and cross-protection. In crossneutralization, antibodies elicited by vaccination with a certain serotype neutralize other serotypes in vitro. Cross-protection means that immunization with a certain vaccine type provides clinically significant protection against infection or disease (or both) owing to another serotype, i.e., that the cross-neutralizing response has a functional impact. One example is the HPV vaccine. Immunity to HPV is type-specific. However, if we look at the phylogenetic tree that includes the various HPV types, we observe that some degree of crossprotection is possible, given the high level of homology of some viral types with vaccine types. This is the case, for instance, for HPV-31 and -35 (strictly related to HPV-16), and for HPV-45 (strictly related to HPV-18). Another example can be seen with rotavirus vaccines. The antibodies elicited by these vaccines not only protect against those circulating strains sharing the same G or P variant as that contained in the vaccine strain, but also other non-matching G and P strains (heterotypic protection). According to this, typespecific antibodies targeted at neutralizing VP7 or VP4 epitopes are not solely responsible for their protective effect. The comparable effectiveness of RV1 and RV5 reinforces this conclusion: neutralizing antibody titers induced by RV1 or RV5 consistently underestimates the protection conferred by the vaccine. Other examples of this cross-reactivity have been confirmed in humans, involving influenza virus-specific immunity, or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, among others.",

            "text": "Cross-protection was described five decades ago and later termed heterologous immunity. The initial observation was that CD8 + -T cells are able to cross-recognize peptides from two distinct viruses and may play roles not only in protective immunity, but also in immunopathology (autoimmunity). According to this phenomenon, memory T cells that are specific to one pathogen can become activated during infection with an unrelated heterologous pathogen. As such, previous host exposure to unrelated infectious agents can greatly alter immune response to an infection. T cells recognize processed peptides that are presented at the cell surface in antigenbinding grooves of class I major histocompatibility class (MHC) proteins. At the same time, the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to the peptide-MHC complex. Thus, a TCR that recognizes a given MHC-presented peptide may also recognize other peptides that fit into the appropriate MHC groove, and has amino acid chains that are able to bind to TCR. This degeneration of the T-cell recognition is called molecular mimicry when the cross-reactive peptide has similar determinants and interacts with TCR in the same manner as the original peptide. It is called alternative recognition when different determinants of the TCR are involved in recognition. A third explanation for cross-reactivity is when a given T cell expresses two different TCRs as a result of an incomplete allelic exclusion of a second TCR chain; in this way, the two distinct TCRs formed may recognize different antigens.",

However, very recently, cross-protective immunity has also been highlighted as one of the mechanisms for the unexpected beneficial effects of BCG vaccination on infections other than tuberculosis. Researchers showed that BCG vaccination induces a long-lasting, nonspecific potentiation effect of heterologous T-helper responses, Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Th17 (IL-17 and IL-22), to non-mycobacterial stimulation. Previously, 1 other authors had demonstrated that both effector and memory CD8+ cells had the potential to secrete IFN-gamma in the absence of related antigens. According to these findings, vaccination can provide not only a heterosubtypic protection, but also heterologous protection through a crossimmunity mechanism.",

The basis for the herd effect is that individuals who are immune to a disease act as a barrier in the spread of disease, slowing or preventing the transmission of disease to others. When a given proportion of the population -known as the herd immunity threshold -becomes immunized, the disease may no longer persist in this population. This threshold is defined based on the \"basic reproduction number\" (R 0 ), which represents the number of people in an unprotected population that could receive the disease from one infected individual. The more contagious the disease, the higher this number, and thus the higher the threshold to be reached to protect the community. For example, measles, an extremely contagious disease, has a threshold of 95% to ensure community protection. On the other hand, mumps, which is not as contagious, needs a threshold of 80% (. Fig. 1 A clear example of herd protection is the case of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine in the UK, the Netherlands, and subsequently in other countries. The impact of this vaccine on the prevalence of the disease was higher than expected according to the population covered with the vaccine, also reducing the number of cases in a nonvaccinated population. This indirect protection was due to the high efficacy of the vaccination at preventing nasopharyngeal carriage and thus, spreading of the pathogen to the rest of the population.",

Expected and Unexpected Effects of Vaccination 1 of scientific papers have documented this unexpected effect of vaccination, and explained it as resulting from an indirect action of vaccines on the immune system, other than their specific expected effect. These so-called heterologous effects of vaccines are now being explored not only for BCGthe most frequently studied in this regard -but also for polio, measles, influenza, rotavirus, and others. Scientific data reveal a dual mechanism for these heterologous properties of vaccines: crossprotective immunity (an old and well-known phenomenon described above) and immune training, a new and revolutionary concept referring to the innate immunological memory and its ability to be trained through vaccination. Immunological memory, or the ability to remember the encounter with a pathogen, used to be considered an exclusive virtue of the adaptive immune system. For some years now, this concept is changing and immunological memory is recognized too as an ability of the innate host defense. Immune training is the term applied to this recently described feature of innate immunity, and its demonstration in humans was first documented with BCG vaccination by Kleinnijenhuis et al.: they showed a BCG-induced trained immunity mechanism of nonspecific protection from infections through epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells as monocytes. This revolutionary concept represents a plausible explanation for the rapid protective effects observed after BCG vaccination, unexplained by the cross-protective effect of the adaptive system -the latter, with long-term effects but slow to develop.",

An association between the AS03-adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccine and the development of narcolepsy has been described in some children and infants due to cross-reactivity to host antigens. In this case, molecular mimicry between a fragment of one of the influenza antigens (nucleoprotein) and a portion of the human brain receptor that promotes wakefulness (hypocretin receptor 2) has been reported as an explanation for this heterologous effect.",

In 2013, a strategic advisory group of experts commissioned by the WHO reviewed all evidence concerning possible nonspecific effects of DTP-containing vaccines on survival and all-cause mortality in children under 5 years of age, concluding that findings on DTP vaccines were inconsistent. Further research into the potential nonspecific effects of DTP vaccines is warranted. Based on current knowledge, it is suggested that the order in the administration of DTP vaccines with other scheduled vaccines (especially BCG) is important in the generation of these nonspecific effects, as DTP seems to oppose the positive heterologous effects of live vaccines.",
