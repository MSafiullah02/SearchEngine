Complications of prematurity underlie more than half of all neonatal deaths worldwide, such that over one million infants die each year due to complications of preterm birth [1]. For those who survive the neonatal period, many face a lifetime of ongoing health problems with a substantially increased risk of significant respiratory morbidity that persists through life [2\u20134]. The risk and severity of lifelong morbidity and mortality are accentuated by the level of prematurity [5,6], birth weight [6] and the presence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [7].",

New BPD is classified in infants born <32 weeks gestation, based on the requirement for supplemental oxygen for at least 28 days after birth, with severity assessed at 36 weeks post-menstrual age [11]. Unlike the older description of progressive fibroproliferative disease [8], new BPD is characterised by premature interruption of alveolar and micro-vascular maturation leading to fewer, immature, larger and more simplified alveoli along with dysmorphic pulmonary vascular development [10, 12].",

During early life, all infants rely heavily upon maternally transferred antibodies as well as components of the innate immune system as a first line of defence and protection against invading pathogens due to the relative immaturity of the pathogen-specific adaptive immunity, which gradually develops after birth [17\u201319]. However, these defences against pathogens are severely compromised in preterm infants [20]. Features of immaturity of innate immunity following preterm birth including a smaller pool of effector cells (neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells and antigen presenting cells) and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines have been reported by several studies [18,21,22]. In addition, the levels of antigen specific immunoglobulins are substantially reduced in preterm infants, since these antibodies are largely transferred across the placenta during the third trimester, particularly after the 32nd week of gestation [23]. Preterm birth is also associated with limited production and function of antimicrobial proteins, peptidases and soluble cytokines [22,24,25].",

Exposure to perinatal infection and intrauterine inflammation have been associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines and premature activation of the immune system which can skew immune responses toward a hyporesponsive (tolerant) phenotype and result in long-term immune programming effects [26,27]. Similarly, exposure to other non-infectious influences including oxidative stress and shear forces generated from supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation have also been associated with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in sustained systematic inflammation and which can further compromise immune responses [18]. Diminished ability to detect and eliminate viruses and other pathogens due to reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes have also observed in preterm infants following antenatal corticosteroid administration, a well-established practise to improve foetal lung maturation and reduce pulmonary complications when preterm labour are suspected (Figure 1) [28].",

Although bacterial outbreak has long been the main focus of nosocomial infection during the neonatal period, previous studies have demonstrated that viral outbreaks can contribute to an equivalent level of mortality (6.4% vs. 7.17% respectively) [33,34]. The role of viruses in nosocomial infection has become increasingly recognised, with several studies showing that 20 to 50% of very preterm infants, born at \u2264 32 weeks\u2019 gestation, acquired a nosocomial infection with a respiratory virus during their birth hospitalisation, often in the absence of clinical indicators of respiratory illnesses [35\u201337]. The detection of asymptomatic respiratory viruses was associated with deleterious outcomes, such as prolonged hospitalisation, increased number of clinical deterioration events as well as a greater requirement and longer duration of supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support [33,34,36,37]. In addition, the risk of developing a BPD diagnosis was more than two-times higher among infants with detected respiratory viruses during their birth hospitalisation [36,37]. Collectively, such findings may advocate for more comprehensive routine testing for respiratory viruses in preterm infants during the neonatal hospitalisation",

However, incidence of RSV-related hospitalisation among preterm infants ranges from 10 to 19% during the first year of life [55\u201360]. The risk of RSV-related hospitalisation is significantly influenced by the neonatal diagnosis of BPD, with studies reporting a 2- to 7-fold increased risk of hospitalisation during the first 2 years of life among preterm infants with BPD compared to those without BPD [60,61], and more than 7-fold increase compared to healthy term-born infants [62]. In addition, RSV-related morbidity is higher among preterm infants, particularly those with BPD, with a greater risk of increased clinical deterioration events, higher therapeutic intervention scores, prolonged hospitalisation and greater requirement for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during RSV-related hospitalisation compared to term-born infants [43,59,63]. One particular study of clinical outcomes during RSV-related hospitalisation showed that preterm infants had significantly longer hospital stays (17 vs. 8 days; P < 0.001) as well as more frequent (41.4 vs. 12.6%) and longer stays in the NICU for invasive respiratory support (13 vs. 6 days; P < 0.001), compared to term-born infants [64].",

In addition, hospitalisation with RSV infection during infancy is associated with increased odds of subsequent hospitalisations with non-respiratory conditions including anaemia, anorexia and fever.

Even though the majority of the data on the long-lasting impact of RSV have been based on studies of healthy term-born infants, limited studies have demonstrated increased risk of asthma [68], recurrent wheeze [34,69,70] and lung function impairments [66] in preterm children with a history of RSV-related hospitalisation during infancy. Early-life hospitalisation with RSV infection in preterm infants has been associated with more than twice the risk of ongoing respiratory morbidity, with wheezing rates ranging from 20.7 to 42.8%, 1\u20132 years following RSV-related hospitalisation compared to 4.1 to 23% following non-RSV related hospitalisation [43]. The risk of asthma, recurrent wheeze and long-lasting impairments in lung function following severe RSV-related respiratory illness during infancy is more pronounced among preterm infants with BPD [66,71] and those born at a lower gestational age [68]. Although most studies demonstrating persistent respiratory morbidity following RSV-related respiratory illness have focused on hospitalised infants, a single study has demonstrated persistent airway resistance at 1 year of age in preterm infants following mild RSV infection that did not require hospitalisation [72].",

Mouse models have also demonstrated the ability of RSV to induce and maintain prolonged inflammatory responses leading to significant damage to the airway epithelium, as well as chronic airway remodelling and persistent airway hyperresponsiveness following the initial infection [75\u201377]. Alterations of the local production of immunoregulatory cytokine, particularly interleukin-10, have also been identified as an important contributor to the subsequent development of recurrent wheeze and persistent airway hyperresponsiveness following RSV infection [78\u201380]. The ability to alter local immune responses has also been proposed as a key mechanism, with some evidence describing the ability of RSV to redirect immune cells and maintain a low level of replication in immunologically privileged sites within the lung (possibly involving neuronal or lymphoid cells) in order to avoid recognition by the immune system [76,77,81]. Such alterations in immune responses sequentially result in latency and chronic persistence of the RSV genome within the lung for several weeks following the initial infection, with studies reporting significant association between the detected level of RSV within the lung and the level of both airway hyperresponsiveness and persistent airway inflammation [76,77].",

However, the use of palivizumab is currently restricted to high-risk infants, as the American Academy of Pediatrics only recommends immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab during the first year of life for infants born at <29 week\u2019s gestation with coexisting morbidities including BPD or hemodynamically unstable cardiovascular disease [85]. Such restricted use of palivizumab has been largely related to the high cost of this treatment (estimated cost for a single course approximately $US 4458 per child), as well as the uncertainty about cost-effectiveness, with recent studies reporting limited or no effect of palivizumab among otherwise healthy preterm infants born at or after 29 weeks\u2019 gestation [86\u201388]. To date, there is no effective acute treatment for RSV, even in high risk groups such as preterm infants. Current recommendations advocate supportive measures only such as respiratory support and hydration [89]. Nevertheless, new RSV treatments such as vaccines and therapeutic agents are currently under development [90]. The successful implementation of these agents will depend on a comprehensive assessment of the burden and risk factors for RSV illnesses and morbidity, in preterm infants both in the community as well as those admitted to hospitals, so that vulnerable infants can be targeted for RSV prevention interventions.",

Rhinovirus (RV) is a major cause of acute respiratory illnesses and wheezing episodes in infants and young children and has been associated with an increased health burden, particularly among preterm infants [91\u201394]. Although RV infections have long been thought to be limited to the common cold and mild self-limiting upper respiratory illnesses, the application of improved viral molecular detection methods has substantially improved understating of the epidemiology and the clinical significance of RV, particularly among high risk children [94\u201398]. In a 2-year prospective study, RV was detected in 41% of all episodes of acute respiratory illnesses and 33% of related hospitalisations during the first year of life in a cohort of preterm infants [99]. The risk and severity of RV-related respiratory illnesses are considerably elevated among preterm infants with BPD, with a more than 5-fold increased risk of RV-related hospitalisation among infants with BPD compared to non-BPD infants [99].",

Insight on the association between RV-related respiratory illnesses and the risk of future asthma originated from the Childhood Origins of Asthma Study, a prospective birth cohort of term-born infants at high risk of asthma and atopy [103]. The prevalence of asthma at 6 years of age was more than three times higher in children who wheezed in the first three years of life during RV-related respiratory illnesses compared to RSV-related respiratory illnesses (Odds ratio = 9.8 vs. 2.6; p < 0.05); even though the majority of these illnesses did not require hospitalisation [104]. Another finding from this cohort suggested that the occurrence of RV-related wheezing illness in the first three years of life is associated with significant airflow limitation and lung function impairment at 5 to 8 years of age [102]. Hospitalisation with RV-related respiratory illness has been associated with a more than 3-fold increase in the rate of recurrent wheeze among healthy term-born infants during the following year [105]. Similarly, hospital presentation and/or admission with an RV-related wheezing illness in childhood is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of subsequent hospitalisation for another respiratory illnesses [106] as well as a more than 4-fold increased risk of subsequent asthma [100].",

Although damage to the developing airways and altered immune responses are thought to be the main mechanisms through which RV could induce asthma and airway hyperreactivity later in life [107,108], others have suggested that early-life infection with RV might be the first indication of the pre-existing tendency in some children to develop asthma, including among preterm infants [109,110]. The ability of RV to induce prolonged and exaggerated inflammatory responses after the initial infection has been described as a potential contributor to the development of chronic respiratory morbidity among preterm infants, with limited data demonstrating increased airway secretion of inflammatory cytokines and remodelling molecules during acute RV infection, particularly among those with BPD [108,111]. The dysregulated immune response to RV infection was associated longitudinally with more severe respiratory morbidity, increased hospitalisation and requirement for intensive care admission during the first 2 years of life [108].",

The occurrence of atopy and allergic sensitization is less frequent following preterm birth, which might be related to altered immune programming during early life and the shift toward a more tolerant immunophenotype [18]. Thus, different pathophysiological mechanisms, other than allergic sensitization, are proposed to underlie the increased risk of asthma and wheezing disorders following preterm birth. This hypothesis has been supported by studies describing the lack of association between allergic sensitization, viral infection and the risk of asthma and diminished lung function later in life among preterm-born children [116\u2013118].",

Additional studies are needed to characterise and assess the consequences of early-life infection with respiratory viruses among preterm infants \u2013 both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Identifying the mechanistic role of respiratory viruses in the development of chronic respiratory morbidity is equally important and may aid the design of more targeted therapeutic strategies to reduce virus-induced pulmonary morbidity, and potentially halt the progression of, or even prevent the development of irreversible airway disease.",
