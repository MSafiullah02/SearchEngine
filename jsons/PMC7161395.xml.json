Emergency personnel or physicians may inform relatives arriving at the scene or hospital. However, in most cases of sudden or violent death in which death is determined at the scene and the family is not present, the medical examiner traditionally notifies the next of kin, although this responsibility is usually not spelled out legally.3\n",

Box 2-1\nprovides brief guidelines for death notifi?cation. When the family's initial needs have been met, any issues related to a medicolegal autopsy should be discussed. Because a distraught family may have difficulty remembering complicated information or may have additional questions, it is useful to provide a telephone number and a written explanation of procedures related to the body and the family's responsibilities.3\nBox 2-1Important guidelines for death notification by medical examiners\n1Notification at the residence of a family member is ideal. If notification occurs in a public setting, seek a private area.2Introduce yourself. Speak slowly and calmly.3Briefly describe the events leading to death, but tell the family that their relative is dead early in the conversation. Fill in details after this or in response to questions.4Use the word \u201cdead\u201d or \u201cdied,\u201d not confusing terms such as \u201cpassed on,\u201d \u201cexpired,\u201d or \u201cgone.\u201d Refer to the deceased by name, and do not refer to the \u201cbody.\u201d5Avoid medical jargon and graphic terms.6If you can honestly tell them that the deceased did not suffer, do so. This may help their grieving process.7If this is a medical examiner's case, advise the family. Explain issues related to release of the body.8Discuss how the deceased's belongings will be returned to the family. Explain whether clothing and other belongings may be retained as evidence.9After the family's immediate needs are met, discuss any issues related to autopsy. Provide them with written information detailing their responsibilities and a telephone number they may call with any questions.10Help them call other relatives or friends, and arrange for any necessary support.11Allow them the opportunity to view the deceased, but prepare them for his or her appearance. Accompany them initially, but permit them time alone with their relative.\n",

The legal custodian of the deceased has the duty to arrange proper disposition of the remains. Although this individual does not have ordinary property rights to the?corpse, he or she may authorize an autopsy; donate tis?sues,?organs, or the entire body for therapeutic or educational purposes; or, following appropriate legal statutes, have the remains cremated or embalmed and moved to a final resting place. The next of kin may place restrictions on the extent and manner in which an autopsy is performed. Any unauthorized dissection may be considered mutilation and is tortious or even criminal.7 Tissue and organ retention is regulated in the United States under state rather than federal law; other countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom have enacted specific legislation with respect to retention of organs.8\n",

However, the law does not establish a standard for determining whether a fetus has advanced to 20 weeks' gestation. Unless there is an obvious discrepancy, we rely on the clinician's assessment of gestational age as determined by medical history, examination, and testing. In ambiguous cases, it is advisable to seek parental consent before the examination. A parent may object to postmortem examination of a stillborn fetus of less than 20 weeks' gestation. Our approach to such a situation would include counseling the family about the value of examination. However, the parents maintain ultimate jurisdiction, and their instructions would be honored. Stillbirths of 20 weeks' gestation and beyond require a standard death certificate and authorization for autopsy, and the usual laws related to disposition of the body pertain.",

However, in a majority of these states, an individual's directives regarding autopsy or interment, or both, may be nullified by the objection of the legal next of kin.12 Before death, the decedent may indicate objection, and in some jurisdictions this is sufficient to prevent routine postmortem examination.13 Some statutes include provisions stating that consent from only one of several persons with custody of the remains is sufficient. In such cases, the wishes of the relative accepting responsibility for burial are often given preference.11 Because disposition of a dead body requires timely action, failure of an individual to assert these rights constitutes a waiver of the right.14 When a party waives these rights, he or she cannot also allege wrongful autopsy. However, some statutes clearly indicate that objection by another person with equal right of custody may preclude an autopsy. Thus, it seems that a pathologist should seek local legal guidance before proceeding with a postmortem examination in which he or she is aware of conflicts among equal next of kin.",

Second, the clinician is probably present at the time of death; she or?he notifies the family of the event and helps the family begin dealing with the legal responsibilities that accompany the death of a relative.

In such situations, the pathologist assumes equal responsibility for properly notifying the medical examiner. This has particular legal consequence for the pathologist.

Therefore, at any stage of an autopsy\u2014review of the medical history, prosection, or microscopic examination\u2014at which a pathologist recognizes issues or findings that indicate that the case should be reported, it is the pathologist's obligation to notify the medical examiner or coroner. This applies equally in cases previously released by the authorities if new discoveries might place the case within their purview. Finally, notification should be made immediately at the time of discovery, not after completion of the dissection or autopsy report.

In general, two documents are of concern for the autopsy pathologist: the autopsy report and the death certificate. Autopsy reports prepared in the setting of a hospital practice are legally protected as part of the confidential medical record. However, in some states, autopsies reported by a medical examiner become part of the public record. Likewise, the public may gain access to causes of death listed on death certificates.25 For these reasons, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association recommends that infection with human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS appear in the autopsy report only when it is relevant to the patient's cause of death.25 Others suggest that government offices adopt a two-part death certificate that includes one part for interment and immediate legal purposes and another for medical certification.26,\n27 This would provide greater privacy to the family of the deceased.",

In the modern world, in which communication in effect establishes a single great parish and the autopsy has a greater influence on the treatment of disease, others express the opinion that postmortem examinations may honor the dead through service to humanity.36,\n38 Consistent with this more liberal attitude, a formal agreement between the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel and the Hadassah Hospital and?Medical School in Jerusalem permitted autopsies in cases required by law, when in the opinion of three physicians the cause of death cannot otherwise be established; in cases involving hereditary diseases when necessary to guide medical care for a family; or when an autopsy may save the lives of others with a similar disease.39,\n40 However, more recently enacted laws?have had the effect of limiting the number of autopsies performed in Israeli hospitals.41\n",

In 1410, Pietro D'Argelata performed an autopsy on Pope Alexander V after his sudden death. In the late fifteenth century, Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree allowing the medical students at Bologna and Padua to study human remains.42 The acceptance of autopsies by the church was well established when, in 1556, the autopsy of Ignatius Loyola revealed stones in the kidneys, bladder, and gallbladder.43\n",

This tradition produced an association of postmortem dissection with crime and contributed to the public's negative attitude toward autopsies.12 The limited numbers of bodies available for dissection in nations under Protestant rule led to the practice of grave robbing and clandestine anatomic studies, resulting in additional adverse public reaction to dissection.38\n",
