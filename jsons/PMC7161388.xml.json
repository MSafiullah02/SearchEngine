They provide antigens that may be incorporated into vaccines composed of peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. They may also be indirectly introduced to the host immune system through recombinant DNA plasmids or chimeric virus vectors. Inactivated vaccines are killed through the use of heat or chemicals, whereas attenuated vaccines contain live, less virulent organisms. Often these vaccines are derived from live viruses that have been cultured under conditions that disable their pathogenic properties. Attenuated vaccines often produce a durable immunological response and thus are preferred for many classes of infectious agents. Subcomponents of microorganisms may also be used as antigens in vaccines. For example, toxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic components and offer protection from the effects of the infection. Additionally, fragments or subunits of an attenuated or inactivated microorganism can also be used as the basis of an antigenic response to a vaccine. Subcomponents may also be used for other purposes. For example, poorly immunogenic components of microorganisms can be improved by their conjugation to proteins that typically are toxins. This approach is often used in conjunction with polysaccharides, which form the outer coat of some infectious bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. Immunization with DNA plasmids and virus vectors involves vaccines that encode an antigen protein that are subsequently expressed within cells of the recipient following administration of the vaccine.",

Vaccine proteins and peptides as presented by APCs interact directly with T-cell receptors that recognize the specific amino-acid sequence in association with class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptors, and humoral antibody production is mediated by B cells.

These cells serve to inhibit immune responses that are potentially harmful by inhibiting or increasing Th1 or Th2 activity. Treg activity is believed to play a role in controlling autoimmune diseases that could possibly arise from wayward responses to the antigen contained in vaccines through antigen-spread response. An interaction between vaccine antigens and adjuvants with Treg is likely but remains unclear and requires further research [1]. Both the generation and maintenance of B and CD8+ T cells are governed by the activity of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, and these cells are frequently subdivided into T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) subtypes.",

These authors found that Lewis rats with a Th1-biased immune response differed in their reaction to aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted vaccine from Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, which have a more balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. Lewis rats demonstrated significantly smaller MMF lesions than Sprague\u2013Dawley rats.

This has resulted in the development of more powerful adjuvants to compensate for the potentially diminished immune response. Nevertheless, alum remains the major adjuvant used in vaccines used to immunize humans. Alum has the propensity to induce effective levels of antibodies mediated by Th2 responses, but has little capacity to stimulate cellular responses mediated by Th1 mechanisms. The latter is an important aspect of immunity for some newer efforts in the development of vaccines [35]. Additionally novel adjuvants address the need to develop more powerful antibody responses in human populations with insufficient responses to vaccines using alum, such as the newborn, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. They also reduce the amount of administered antigen (antigen sparing). Although a number of recently developed adjuvants clearly demonstrate the potential for increased immunogenicity, concerns about their safety remain [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Adjuvants may be classified in various ways reflecting various properties (see Table 27.1).",

These adverse effects reflect the activation of various components of the immune system, and will vary with the specific nature of the vaccine antigen and/or adjuvant. Similar to naturally occurring infections, the administration of a vaccine results in the activation of cells regulating immunity and the resultant inflammation is accompanied by the release of various proinflammatory cytokines and frequently evokes an acute-phase response.

Changes in the arterial response to hyperemia were accompanied by small increases in CRP and fibrinogen levels, which were considered to be indicative of a systemic inflammatory response to the vaccine. Dilatory responses to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate and carotid intima-media thickness as measured by external ultrasound were not altered. Similarly, Hingorani et al. [46], in a small number of human subjects, found that after the administration of an attenuated capsular polysaccharide vaccine of Salmonella typhi, significant dysregulation of arterial endothelial function occurred in both resistance and conduit blood vessels that was accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response characterized by elevations in white blood cell count and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. Beyond influences on cardiovascular physiology, changes in underlying cytokine levels were reported to be factors in alterations of negative mood affect following administration of the S. typhi\nvaccine [47], [48], which may be linked to the direct influence of the inflammatory actions of vaccines on malaise, lethargy, and impaired cognitive ability sometimes observed in clinical populations.",

In some aspects, these cases appear to mimic the course of increased disease severity, or adverse events due to natural infections. The most well-established examples of increased disease severity occur with respiratory syncytial, dengue, and measles virus infections. Children immunized with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI)-RSV or RSV G vaccines were infected with RSV. This infection was associated with enhanced disease and pulmonary eosinophilia that was believed to be due to an exaggerated memory Th2 response [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Animal models of respiratory syncytial virus infection have suggested various mechanisms as a causal role, including sensitizing antibodies to untoward sites, unfavorable T-cell responses, or overexuberant immune responses involving cytokines or interleukins [57].",

In this regard, three different mechanisms may be at work, namely molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, and autoimmune dysregulation. The incidence of autoimmune-induced disease is low, and in many cases cannot be reliably associated with the administration of vaccines. Although no unequivocal associations are known, various possible pathogenic mechanisms exist. Molecular mimicry is the result of an immune response to shared epitopes between antigens of the host and antigenic components of the vaccine. To assess this potential toxicity, protein sequences may be screened in computer base searches of amino-acid structures between antigenic protein components and known protein structures. Another possible mechanism for the autoimmune phenomenon is epitope spreading. Three different types of this are believed possible: shared identical amino-acid sequences between peptides and/or proteins, homologous but nonidentical amino-acid sequences, and epitopes on dissimilar chemical structures such between DNA and peptides or carbohydrates and peptides.\n",

T cells may exhibit epitope spreading as a response, which is not directed at the original epitope, but as recognition of epitopes in target-tissue proteins expressed in the inflammatory process caused by the vaccine. Additionally, other theoretical mechanisms exist. These include activation by superantigens of a large fraction of T-cell populations and induction of inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules. However, there is currently a lack of in vivo evidence that molecular mimicry is associated with vaccines, although it remains an issue of concern.",

Clinical chemistry tests are used to diagnose disease, to monitor disease progression or response to therapy or toxin exposure, and to screen for the presence of underlying disease in apparently healthy animals. A wide variety of clinical chemistry tests are used for this purpose. The results of the following parameters are included in the clinical chemistry testing [73]:1.Electrolyte balance (calcium, chloride, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium). Changes in free water and changes in electrolytes themselves (rate of intake, excretion/loss, and translocation within the body) affect the electrolyte levels in blood. As electrolytes are essential to the proper functioning of cells, the body maintains electrolyte concentrations within narrow limits.2.Carbohydrate metabolism (glucose (principal source of energy for mammalian cells)). Sources of glucose include digestion of dietary carbohydrates, break down of glycogen in the liver (glycogenolysis), and production of glucose from amino-acid precursors in the liver (gluconeogenesis). Hormones (eg, insulin, glucagon, catecholamine, growth hormone, and corticosteroids) affect blood glucose concentration by facilitating its entry into or removal from the circulation. Changes in blood glucose levels due to test-article treatment could be an indication of an adverse event through the above-mentioned pathways.3.Liver function (alanine animotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), total bile acids, alkaline phosphate (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin). Injury to liver parenchymal cells can be detected by measuring the hepatocellular leakage enzymes (ALT, AST, SDH, and GLDH). Enzyme leakage from cells through damaged cell membranes is indicated by the increased serum activity of these enzymes. Cholestasis, which implies impairment of bile flow, is diagnosed by the changes in ALP and GGT levels. Cholestasis will result in elevations of bilirubin in blood if it is severe. The main value of these enzymes is their greater sensitivity for this abnormality as compared to serum bilirubin levels alone. Gamma-glutamyl transferase is more specific than alkaline phosphatase for this purpose.4.Muscle enzymes (AST (used also as liver injury marker, see above), creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase). Creatine kinase, present in high concentration in the cytoplasm of myocytes, is the most widely used enzyme for evaluation of neuromuscular disease and is a \u201cleakage\u201d enzyme. This enzyme functions by making ATP available for contraction in muscles. This is done by the phosphorylation of ADP from creatine phosphate by catalyzing the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP to form phosphocreatine + ADP. Phosphocreatine is the major storage form of high-energy phosphate in muscle. Lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. It is not tissue-specific, being found in a variety of tissues, including liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Lactate dehydrogenase levels could be elevated by exercise, liver disease, muscle disease, and neoplasia.5.Kidney function (creatine and blood urea nitrogen). Urea and creatinine tests are normally used as indicators of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Ammonia, generated by catabolism of amino acids derived either from digestion of proteins in the intestines or from endogenous tissue proteins, is used by hepatocytes to synthesize urea. Urea is excreted by the kidney and intestine and in saliva and sweat. Plasma urea nitrogen concentrations depend on hepatic urea production and renal tubular flow rate. Increases in protein catabolism and digestion and decreases in GFR cause an increase in urea nitrogen levels. Plasma urea nitrogen levels are decreased when protein intake is decreased, protein anabolism, increase in excretion, and decrease in production (eg, liver disease). Muscle metabolism results in the production of creatinine. An energy-storing molecule in muscle called phosphocreatine undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form creatine and inorganic phosphorous. Creatinine is the result of creatine decomposition.6.Proteins (total protein, albumin, globulin, and A:G ratio). Total protein and albumin are the measured parameters, and globulins and A:G ratio are calculated from them. Quantitative values for the above major proteins are the test results. However, there are many different types of proteins within the globulin fraction besides immune globulins, such as those associated with the acute-phase response, and this measurement does not provide information on these fractions. Both quantitative and qualitative data for the different fractions that comprise total protein could be obtained by electrophoresis. Electrophoresis can be used on serum, urine, or body-cavity fluid samples (eg, cerebrospinal fluid).7.Lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol). In serum, triglycerides are incorporated into lipoproteins that are composed of a coat of phospholipid, cholesterol, and proteins (apolipoproteins) enclosing a hydrophobic center of cholesterol esters and triglycerides. The most commonly occurring steroid is cholesterol. Cholesterol is a precursor of cholesterol esters, bile acids, and steroid hormones. It is derived from dietary sources and synthesized in vivo from acetyl-CoA in the liver (main site) and other tissues (intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs).\n",

Hematocrit (HCT) is calculated as the product of the mean cell volume (MCV) and the red blood cell (RBC) count. Packed cell volume (PCV) is a directly measured value obtained from centrifuging blood in a microhematocrit tube in a microhematocrit centrifuge. Hemoglobin concentration (Hb) is reported as grams of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood (g/dL). Hemoglobin concentration of whole blood normally is about one third of the HCT (ie, the MCHC is 33%) because red cells are approximately 33% hemoglobin. The MCV, expressed in femtoliters (fL; 10\u221215\n L), indicates the volume of the \u201caverage\u201d red cell in a sample. Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) represents the absolute amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell in a sample and its units are picograms (pg) per cell. The MCH is calculated from the Hb and the RBC values using the following equation: MCH (pg) = (Hb \u00d7 10) \u00f7 RBC. The MCHC is the mean cell hemoglobin concentration, expressed in g/dL. It is calculated from the Hb and the PCV using mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) = (Hb \u00f7 PCV) \u00d7 100. The term \u201chypochromic\u201d is used for red cell populations with values below the reference interval. This can occur in a strongly regenerative anemia, where an increased population of reticulocytes with low Hb content \u201cpulls\u201d the average value down. Low MCHC can also occur in iron deficiency anemia, where microcytic, hypochromic red cells are produced because of the lack of iron to support hemoglobin synthesis.",

This is termed a regenerative response. Detecting immature erythrocytes by virtue of the presence of RNA in the form of ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum in their cytoplasm is required to evaluate the bone marrow response. The more immature the cell, the more RNA it contains. In contrast, mature red blood cells, which are no longer synthesizing hemoglobin, contain very small amounts or no RNA.",

Fibrinogen (factor I) [75] is synthesized by the liver and is soluble plasma glycoprotein that is converted by thrombin into fibrin during blood coagulation. To form a clot, fibrin is then cross-linked by factor XIII. It has been shown, in recent research, that fibrin plays a key role in the inflammatory response and development of rheumatoid arthritis. Prothrombin time is a blood test that measures the time it takes for plasma to clot, to check for bleeding problems, or to check whether medicine to prevent blood clots is working.

            "text": "Since the early 1990s, a new approach to vaccination has been actively developed. These novel approaches include the direct introduction of plasmid DNA containing the gene encoding the antigen against which an immune response is sought by incorporating antigens into appropriate host tissues and the in situ production of the target antigen(s). The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches are that it stimulates both B- and T-cell responses, the vaccine has improved stability, the absence of any infectious agents, and the relative ease of large-scale manufacture [93]. Vaccines are generally used as biological medicinal products for the prophylaxis of infectious disease, but DNA vaccines are also being developed for therapeutic use (eg, against infectious disease or other diseases such as cancer). Using genes from a variety of infectious agents, including influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, malaria, and mycoplasma, many scientific publications [93] explore the potential of DNA vaccination and immune responses in animals. For nucleic acid and viral vector-based vaccines, biodistribution studies are necessary to determine the tissue distribution following administration and the potential for the vector to integrate into the host genome [93], [94]. The design of nonclinical safety tests should take into consideration the use of the DNA vaccine and the risk/benefit situation. In addition to following GLP requirements for preclinical toxicology studies (see above), DNA studies should also evaluate any local inflammatory response (eg, myositis), organ-specific autoimmunity, immunopathology, and other relevant parameters. In particular, where the encoded antigen is a self-antigen, or may show self-antigen mimicry, a wider range of studies (including autoantibodies) may be necessary to address the specific concerns [93].",

Nasal discharge, cough, fever, labored breathing, and weight loss have been reported in pigs as the cause of certain swine strains, which made this animal a useful model for studies of immunity and pathogenesis [129], [130], [131]. For study of the 2009H1N1 pandemic virus (A/California/04/09), specific-pathogen-free miniature pigs were used [132]. This model was particularly attractive because of the availability of a number of reagents enabling studies of immune correlates of protection [133]. Highly pathogenic avian viruses did not cause severe clinical signs of disease in pigs [134]. However, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses did cause disease and death in cats [135], [136]. Thus cats were considered a good model to test protection against disease and death due to highly pathogenic avian-origin strains. H1N1 virus causes a moderate level of disease in cats when infected intratracheally, replicating primarily in the lungs but can also be isolated from other organs [137]. Pigs and cats are not extensively used for studies of pathogenesis, immunity, or transmission of human influenza and therefore are not currently used routinely to support human vaccine studies [110].",

Infection of inbred mice with Leishmania species pathogenic for humans superseded the L. enriettii guinea pig model [148]. The spectrum of disease manifestations observed in human leishmaniasis can be mimicked in the laboratory by infection of different inbred strains of mice with L. major. Including a range of susceptibility states depending on the strain of mouse used, the mouse model reproduces many aspects of human disease. Upon infection, BALB/c mice develop large skin ulcers, which expand and metastasize, leading to death. However, C57BL/6 and CBA/N mice are resistant; they develop small lesions that cure in 10\u201312 weeks, and are resistant to reinfection. Intermediate susceptibility was reported in most other strains of mice [149]. Both susceptible and resistant mice produce Th2 cytokines during the period of active lesion development [150], [151]. The difference between susceptible and resistant mice is that the latter are able to switch to a Th1 profile and control the disease [152], [153].",

[166] reported that immunization with DNA-encoding herpes simplex virus type 2 full length glycoprotein D (HSV-2 gD) or a truncated form of HSV-2 g-induced immune responses in mice and protected them from lethal challenge with HSV-2. They also showed that a combination of these two DNAs protected guinea pigs from primary genital disease. McClements et al. [166] also found that protective immunity could be induced by low doses of DNA in the mouse model with only a single immunization. Additionally, other investigators demonstrated protective immunity in the mouse [167], [168], [169] and guinea pig [170], HSV-infection models were induced by multiple immunizations with higher doses of gD DNA or gB DNA. Provost et al. [171] reported that both the marmoset and the chimpanzee are useful models for hepatitis A virus behavior in man.",

Difficulties associated with efficient vaccine delivery and weak immune responses following mucosal immunization made the induction of protective immune responses at mucosal surfaces an elusive goal. Thus for the evaluation of mucosal vaccine-delivery technologies, effective and safe mucosal adjuvants, and the characterization of mucosal immune responses, an appropriate animal model is required. In mice, intranasal vaccination may be associated with inhalation and ingestion of vaccine antigens. This makes it difficult to discriminate between intranasal, oral, and intrapulmonary vaccination. However, larger animals like the pig or the cow can be used for the controlled delivery of vaccines to the nasal passages [178], [179]. The nasal passages of these animals more closely resemble that of humans than do those of the mouse. Surgical models have also been useful for screening a variety of mucosal vaccine delivery technologies and potential mucosal adjuvants [180], [181].",

Because it replicates in the body, only a small amount of viral material needs to be injected. Less viral material means a reduced risk of allergic and injection site reactions. No adjuvant is required in this kind of vaccine, hence the risks of allergic and injection site reactions are reduced. Other than injection, live vaccines can be given by other routes (eg, intranasal). Thus live vaccines can potentially be tailored to induce immunity in the areas of the body where it will be most effective (eg, immunity in respiratory system to protect against respiratory viruses). The drawbacks of live vaccines are:1.It must be stored carefully, or its potency may be lost.2.Immunocompromised or pregnant animals/humans might get the disease.3.Severe complications might be caused by certain live vaccines (eg, live rabies vaccines can cause fatal neurological disease in some dogs and cats).4.Poorly produced vaccines may contain virulent organisms that could produce severe disease.5.Some live vaccines can cause severe illness if given by the wrong route (eg, injectable cat flu vaccine viruses that accidentally get inhaled by a cat will produce marked signs of cat flu, and intranasal Bordetella vaccine viruses can cause liver damage and death if injected).\n",

            "text": "In addition to toxicity studies, in vivo and in vitro assays play a significant role in assessing critical safety characteristics of vaccines. Testing encompasses assessments for identity, purity, safety, and efficacy in terms of antigenicity and potency. Generally, these types of study are aimed at detecting undesirable contaminants or impurities, characterizing the vaccine product, and ensuring conformation to specified manufacturing standards. Unlike toxicity studies, which explore the potential for unanticipated risk, or further refine the understanding of adverse effects, product characterization studies emphasize, quantify, and examine aspects that are associated with the properties of vaccines such as potency and are important to the consistent and safe manufacture of vaccines. In some respects, these studies may be considered to be focused toxicity studies that have restricted or narrow endpoints that include survival or clinical signs. Among the most important are tests for potency, general safety (21CFR610.11), neurovirulence (IABS Scientific Workshop on Neurovirulence Tests for Live Vaccines, WHO, 2005), tumorigenicity (Meeting Report, WHO Study Group on Cell Substrates for Production of Biologicals, WHO, 2007; European Pharmacopoeia Section 5.2.3), and pyrogenicity (21CFR610.13). The degree and nature of these tests depend on the immunological mechanisms involved in the action of the vaccine or the nature of potential unwanted constituents.",
