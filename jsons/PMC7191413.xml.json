            "text": "Vitrectomy, an ocular surgery performed to partially or completely remove the vitreous, is widely used to treat various ocular conditions, such as cloudy vitreous, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy [1\u20133]. Most vitrectomies are performed to facilitate surgery to address one of a variety of retinal conditions [3]. Some vitrectomies are conducted for diagnostic purposes. With advances in the instrumentation available, vitrectomy has become a well-established procedure. Serious vitrectomy-associated complications are very rare [1, 3]; however, like other types of ocular surgeries, vitrectomy may traumatize the conjunctival tissues, often resulting in the development of secondary dry eye disease (DED) [4\u20136]. Using the demographic and clinical features of patients to predict risk for vitrectomy-related DED will facilitate decision-making in the management of vitrectomy patients and improve the relationship between doctors and patients. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the prediction of risk for secondary DED in patients scheduled to undergo vitrectomy.",

To quantify preoperative BUT, sodium fluorescein solution was dripped into the conjunctival sac. After the patient had blinked several times, he/she was asked to look straight ahead. The patient was evaluated under wide-angle cobalt blue light from the slit lamp. The time from the last blink to appearance of the first black spot on the cornea was considered as tear film rupture time. After repeated measurements, the average value was obtained. For preoperative corneal fluorescein staining, fluorescein solution was dripped into the conjunctival sac of the eye that had been operated upon, which was then observed under the cobalt blue light from the slit lamp. The presence of any corneal epithelial defect was recorded. The range of corneal staining was scored as follows: corneal epithelial nonstaining, 0; dispersed fluorescence throughout the cornea, 1; slightly dense corneal staining, 2; and dense or flaky corneal staining, 2. Intraocular pressure (IP) was measured with a noncontact tonometer, with the range of normal values considered to be 10\u201321 mmHg.

First, factors thought to increase risk for dry eye secondary to vitrectomy were extracted as input layer vectors. Second, we established a neural network model, which consisted of three layers: input and output layers on both sides and hidden layers in the middle. Each hidden layer comprised multiple layers. Finally, forward and backward propagation networks were trained. For forward propagation, independent variables were input into the neural network from the input layer and then passed through several hidden layers. Finally, the prediction results were output to the output layer. For back propagation, an error backpropagation algorithm and the gradient descent optimization method were used to adjust the weights of each network layer. Error information was obtained by comparing the output information and expected information. The chain derivation method was employed to obtain error information for each step. Each layer was propagated forward to obtain the corresponding error information, and the weight and bias of each layer were adjusted accordingly.",

History of diabetes mellitus and surgical duration were identified as risk factors only by the LR model, while preoperative CCT was only identified as a risk factor for vitrectomy-associated DED by the ANN model.

The pathogenesis of DED includes inflammation, apoptosis of the lacrimal gland cells and conjunctival epithelial cells, and androgen imbalance [13, 14]. The results of this study helped us to identify the mechanisms underlying DED after vitrectomy. First, the corneal epithelium and conjunctiva may be damaged by vitrectomy. After the operation, numerous factors may disturb the ocular surface, including scleral sutures, conjunctival sutures, incisions, and conjunctival edema. Corneal curvature may be affected, resulting in a decrease in tear film stability [15]. Importantly, it has been reported that basic fibroblast growth factor (alone or in combination with cytochrome c peroxidase) accelerates the healing of surgically damaged corneal epithelium [16, 17]. We therefore sought to investigate the benefit of reducing the occurrence of DED in patients who had undergone vitrectomy. Second, vitrectomy-associated congestion and edema of the corneal tissue may affect the adhesion of mucin, allowing for the infiltration of inflammatory factors. This process can cause lacrimal gland damage, which exacerbates any corneal damage [18]. Prolonged surgical time can thus destroy the stability of the tear film and lead to secondary dry eye after vitrectomy. Third, corneal goblet cells are more sensitive and vulnerable to external environmental factors, such as hyperglycemia (in diabetic patients). Metabolic disorders and nutritional disorders shorten the tear film rupture time and destroy the normal corneal morphology, thereby reducing the secretion of mucin. Finally, the eye drops often prescribed for patients after vitrectomy contain preservatives, which can affect corneal epithelial integrity, damage repair functions, and reduce the regularity of the corneal surface. All of these factors decrease tear film stability [19].",
