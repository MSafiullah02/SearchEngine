            "text": "Background: Electroencephalographic (EEG) indicators for anaesthesia depth are being developed. Here, we propose novel EEG parameters created by using two kinds of waveforms discriminated by voltage thresholds from a new perspective. Methods: Six young-adult beagles and 6 senior beagles were anaesthetised with end-tidal sevoflurane (SEV) of 2.0%-4.0% in 0.5% intervals, and 2-channel EEG (256 Hz) was recorded. Two events were discriminated: a consecutive part (\u03c4) with a peak-to-peak potential difference (Vpp) within 1-6, 8, 12, or 20 \u00b5V, and another part (burst) with Vpp outside the threshold. Number of \u03c4 (N\u03c4), mean \u03c4 duration (M\u03c4), total percentage of \u03c4 (SR\u03c4), mean burst duration (Mbst), and amplitude of burst (Abst) were evaluated as anaesthesia depth indicators using Pearson's correlation coefficients (r). Results: When Vpp was near the suppression wave threshold, N\u03c4 had the highest correlation with SEV in both groups. As SEV was increased until onset of burst suppression, N\u03c4 decreased, M\u03c4 remained unchanged, and Mbst and Abst increased. In the young-adult group, mean |r| exceeded 0.95 for N\u03c4 with Vpp of 4-6 \u00b5V, for Mbst with Vpp of 8-12 \u00b5V, and for Abst with Vpp of 4-12 \u00b5V. In the senior group, r exceeded 0.90 for N\u03c4 with Vpp of 4 \u00b5V and for Abst with Vpp of 5-12 \u00b5V. Conclusion: We developed new EEG parameters that were almost perfectly correlated with volatile anaesthetic concentrations using traditional bipolar recording. This study suggests that the effect of anaesthetics on EEG can be investigated from two directions: pacemaker (\u03c4) and generator (burst).",

Because a complete suppression wave (i.e., non-electrical activity) is the endpoint of anaesthetic action regardless of species, this study discriminated an ultrashort suppression wave (ms), named \"\u03c4\" (tau), and a wave between adjacent \u03c4 suppression waves, named \"burst\". The \u03c4 waves appear rhythmically on a short time scale. Relationships between sevoflurane concentration and parameters derived from \u03c4 and burst were examined using traditional bipolar EEG recording in beagles.",

Simultaneously, raw signals were exported into EEG analysis software (Bispectral Analyzer for A2000) and down sampled to 256 Hz. 16 To avoid the checking time of the BIS monitor, 3 EEG data packets of 64 s were extracted for analysis. One-second moving averages were subtracted from the data, which were divided into mutually non-overlapping 2s periods, and Welch's window function was applied. Subsequently, discrete Fourier transform was performed at 50 \u00b1 1 Hz and 100 \u00b1 1 Hz to remove noise caused by the alternating current power source.

            "text": "We first focused on an ultrashort suppression wave. Enlarging the EEG waveform ( Figure 1B and C) revealed that the suppression wave was not flat but fluctuating and comprised minute waves with periods of approximately 0.010 s. Such waves ranging from 1 min to a few minutes in duration were scattered throughout the EEG data at any level of anaesthesia, and we refer to these waves as \"\u03c4 \" waves ( Figure 1D and E). We defined a waveform between two adjacent \u03c4 waves as a \"burst\". Thus, EEG waveforms were classified into two types of waves, namely \u03c4 and burst. After detecting peaks in EEG data using the first derivative, Each consecutive part in which the potential difference between adjacent peaks (peak-to-peak-voltage) was within a given voltage threshold was defined as \u03c4. Each consecutive part in which the potential difference between adjacent peaks was outside the voltage threshold (between adjacent \u03c4 waves) was defined as a burst (Fig. 1A) . The potential difference threshold (Vpp) was set at 1-6 \u00b5V in 1-\u00b5V intervals and additionally at 8, 12 and 20 \u00b5V. Despite some individual differences in the measured potential, this measure was roughly classified according to the magnitude of Vpp referenced from the enlarged EEG data as follows. When Vpp was set to approximately 1-3 \u00b5V, \u03c4 was detected as a microwave. When Vpp was set around 3-8 \u00b5V, \u03c4 was detected as a fluctuating suppression wave. When Vpp was set to 8-20 \u00b5V, a burst was detected as a spike wave. New EEG parameters Based on \u03c4 and burst components in 64 s of EEG data, we developed the following 5 new Abst (\u00b5V) = (\u00b5 )\u2044 \u03a3\u03c4 (s) denotes the sum of all \u03c4 events. \u03a3burst (s) denotes the sum of all burst events. Nbst is the total number of burst events occurring in 64 s and is equal to N\u03c4 or N\u03c4 \u00b1 1. \u03a3amp (\u00b5V) is the sum of the difference between the maximum and minimum voltages in a burst, which we call burst amplitude. M\u03c4 (s) is mean \u03c4 duration (s). SR\u03c4 is the total percentage of \u03c4 events in the 64-s interval and can be calculated from N\u03c4 and M\u03c4. Mbst (s) is mean burst duration and can be calculated using N \u03c4 and M \u03c4 . Abst (\u00b5V) is mean burst amplitude. Under deep anaesthesia, where burst suppression (BS) appears on EEG, both M\u03c4 and SR\u03c4 within Vpp of 3-8 \u00b5V should increase. Finally, when EEG data comprise a completely flat wave, N\u03c4 equals 1. Data were analysed by a program written in C. The graphical outputs were generated using gnuplot (Version 5.1, http://www.gnuplot.info/).",

In 11 animals other than S3, the highest |r| between SEV and N\u03c4 was 0.93-0.98, including a nearly perfect fit of |r| = 0.98 in 4 animals. Mean N\u03c4 had the strongest negative correlation with SEV for Vpp of 6 \u00b5V in the young-adult group and for Vpp of 4 \u00b5v in the senior group (Figures 2 and 3 ). For the same Vpp, M\u03c4 remained within a narrow range (0.02-0.04 s) and was also constant at any SEV <3.5% in each animal. In young-adult animals except YA3 and in S1, S4 and S6, Mbst was strongly correlated with SEV. In YA3, S2, S3 and S5, the correlation between Mbst and SEV weakened as Mbst decreased at 4.0% SEV. In addition, for almost all Vpp values, Abst showed strong correlation with SEV. In 11 animals, except S3, the highest r value between SEV and Abst was 0.91-0.99, including r \u2265 0.97 in 5 animals. Especially in YA1 and YA2, Abst showed remarkably positive correlation (r = 0.99) with SEV for almost all Vpp values. with SEV in all animals except S5, where the EEG data were almost completely occupied by suppression.",

One wave consisting of the potential difference between adjacent peaks within a threshold of voltage (Vpp) was defined as a \u03c4 event, and the other wave exceeding the threshold was defined as a burst. Increasing the value of Vpp changes target detection to microwave, suppression wave and spike wave events. The parameters created based on \u03c4 and burst events showed specific trends with respect to depth of anaesthesia in all animals. The number of \u03c4 events (N\u03c4) showed almost perfect negative correlation with SEV in almost all animals when Vpp was 2\u22126 \u00b5V.

            "text": "When BS was clearly present on EEG, M\u03c4 and the total percentage of \u03c4 (SR\u03c4) increased as expected. Mean burst duration (Mbst) increased with increasing SEV in the absence of BS. The amplitude of burst (Abst) showed almost perfect positive correlation with SEV across a wide range of Vpp values in all animals. Additionally, the correlation coefficient between those parameters and SEV changed stepwise according to the magnitude of Vpp. To our knowledge, this is the first report to introduce EEG parameters having a strong linear correlation close to \u00b11 with volatile anaesthetic concentration. In our previous study, enlarged EEG waveforms were observed to measure the suppression ratio, and it seemed that an ultrashort suppression appeared occasionally but rhythmically at any SEV. Moreover, a complete suppression wave (N \u03c4 = 1) is the endpoint of anaesthetic action regardless of species. Hence, in this study, an ultrashort suppression wave ( Figure 1E ) was discriminated as a \u03c4 event to investigate depth of anaesthesia. The frequency of \u03c4 events showed very strong negative correlation with anaesthetic concentration. In addition, our previous study also showed that there was value in focusing on the ultrashort suppression wave. Suppression wave was defined as <2.25 \u00b5V using the same EEG data of the senior dogs. 15 This value corresponds to Vpp of 4.5 \u00b5V, which is close to 4 \u00b5V, which occurred when |r| was highest in the senior group. Furthermore, the behaviour of N\u03c4 is consistent with previous findings comparing young-adult and senior beagles. In general, the amount of anaesthesia required decreases with age, 18 19 and the measured potential is higher at a younger age, with less resistance because of more moisture and less fibre. Indeed, for example, mean N\u03c4 for Vpp of 6 \u00b5V in the young-adult group, which was most strongly correlated with SEV, was greater than the Vpp of 4 \u00b5V in the senior group at any SEV (N\u03c4 = 829 vs 748, N\u03c4 = 766 vs 731, N\u03c4 = 692 vs 675, N\u03c4 = 653 vs 601, N\u03c4 = 585 vs 478 at 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, and 4.0% SEV, respectively). Three key conclusions can be made based on these findings. (1) The strongest correlation between the number of \u03c4 events and SEV was when Vpp was close to the suppression criterion. (2) In almost all animals, the number of \u03c4 events correlated fairly strongly with SEV. (3) The N\u03c4 results were consistent with age differences in depth of hypnosis and measurement of potential. These results suggest that \u03c4 is a suitable anaesthetic indicator. Additionally, \u03c4, similar to some fluctuations in suppression waves ( Figure 1E ), seems to show a momentary electrical pause synchronised in some areas, resembling a rhythm between electrical activity. In that case, a decrease in N\u03c4 means that the tempo of the electrical pauses slows as anaesthesia deepens. Furthermore, BS, an indicator of excessive anaesthesia, tended to appear when N\u03c4 was <600 in this study, which we presume depended on the amount of nerve tissue monitored by the electrodes.",

This circuit is monitored by the reticular formation in the brainstem using acetylcholine as a transmitter. Rhythmic firing of thalamic neurons produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) synchronously with pyramidal neurons. That frequency is determined by EPSP duration and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) duration in thalamic neurons. In other words, it is dependent on the membrane potential level of the thalamus. 21 24 25 Anaesthetics, including sevoflurane, act on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAA) to open chloride channels and inhibit EPSP transmission and promote IPSP transmission. 26 27 Furthermore, volatile anaesthetics have an inhibitory effect on the hyperpolarisation activated current (H current) that slowly causes depolarisation of post-hyperpolarisation and contributes to the generation of synchronised oscillatory neural rhythms. 28 29 Indeed, use of 1%-4% sevoflurane dose-dependently inhibits H current. 30 The inhibition of H current may lead to tempo delay.",

In contrast, although Mbst calculated from N\u03c4 and M\u03c4 was nearly proportional to Abst in the absence of BS, the proportional relationship no longer held at BS levels (supplementary). These results might reflect the effect of anaesthetics on the postsynaptic potential activity of pyramidal cells in the neocortex, the main component of EEG readings. High-amplitude slow waves on EEG due to the administration of anaesthetics are well known. Through the hyperpolarisation of thalamic cortical neurons, delta waves are generated on EEG. 25 Moreover, during BS, the hyperpolarisation of cortical neurons blocks input from the thalamus, which then stops working. Endogenous pacemakers can activate 30%-40% of thalamic neurons, inducing activity of thalamic cortical neurons. They also activate cortical neurons from the hyperpolarised membrane potential as burst waves in the BS pattern. 31 32 In this study, we defined Abst as the potential difference indicating the magnitude of current energy. When deciding which EEG parameters to set, both the root mean square (RMS) value of amplitude and Abst were examined. Although the relationship between SEV and RMS was similar to that of Abst, the r value was inferior.",

As the threshold was increased, the duration of detection increased and the number of detections decreased, in a manner that was dependent on the distribution of the amplitude of the EEG waveform. Accordingly, although it is difficult to accurately detect small potential differences of suppression waves owing to individual differences in resistance based on tissue and skeleton, a value close to the actual number of ultrashort suppressions can be detected with an approximate Vpp threshold. Even for a large difference in amplitude between individuals, Vpp can be set each time based on M\u03c4, which has an almost constant value and lacks individual differences. Also, this method uses a popular 2-channel bipolar recording method. These results show that such new parameters could be widely applicable.",
