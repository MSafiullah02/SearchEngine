The three key dimensions of this response are: (i) emotional exhaustion (EE), or a loss of enthusiasm in one\u2019s work; (ii) depersonalization (DP), or an impersonal response to patients; and (iii) personal accomplishment (PA), or a feeling of carrying out one\u2019s job successfully [1,2]. Burnout has been included in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases as an occupational phenomenon [3] affecting a broad spectrum of workers [4]. Healthcare professionals are more likely to develop burnout [5], and nurses in particular are among the major risk groups [6]. Studies have reported high values in this respect for nurses [7,8].",

Moreover, in ED, waiting times, a demanding public, overcrowding, and inadequate human resources are common stressors [17,18]. Similarly, occupational stress, defined as the perception of a discrepancy between environmental demands (stressors) and individual capacities to fill these demands determined by work organization, work design, and labor relations [19], is also associated with burnout [20]. The prevalence of job stress is increasing globally [21]. Over a number of studies, between 27% to 46.9% of ED nursing staff reported a high level of occupational stress [22,23]. This situation may, in turn, lead to nursing errors and lower patient satisfaction [24].",

The main objectives of this study were therefore as follows: to estimate the burnout, perceived stress, job satisfaction, coping and general health levels experienced by nurses working in Spanish EDs and to analyze the relationship between the sociodemographic, occupational, and psychological variables and the occurrence of burnout syndrome among these professionals.",

This is consistent with the results of another study carried out among emergency and intensive nursing staff [63]. The use of adaptive coping styles produces a positive effect on physical and psychological well-being, management of stress, and overall performance among healthcare professionals [64], which is related to an improvement in the quality of care, greater patient safety, and a fall in health service costs [65]. This is congruent with our results that showed that the use of problem-focused coping reduced both social dysfunction and anxiety and depressive symptomatology. We found that the most commonly used coping strategy was problem-focused coping and the least common was avoidance coping, as in similar studies [18,64,66,67,68]. The use of avoidance coping may be explained by the low level of personal suffering due to the high turnover rate occurring in EDs [56]. In the multivariate analysis, EE and DP were determined positively by the use of avoidance coping, which was consistent with the findings of other authors [69,70]. It should be noted that some authors have long argued that the DP dimension is in fact a coping style [71,72]. In addition, this type of coping was positively related to somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression. These results were similar to those of Yates et al. [73]. Nevertheless, avoidance coping may be the best option for ED personnel when an event occurs in order to avoid emotional involvement [74].",

However, this result should be viewed with caution due to the sample of our study consisting predominantly of women. While previous studies noted that gender is an important variable in EE and that women experience more burnout than men [75,76], there are other studies which suggest that the burnout is not associated with gender in EDs [77,78]. The significantly higher EE scores in women may be due to the social role played by women and their effort to strike a better work-life balance [79]. In addition, work-family conflicts are considered important risk factors in the development of burnout among women [80]. Regarding the age of ED nurses, G\u00f6k\u00e7en et al. [81] determined that this was positively related to EE. On the other hand, Schooley et al. [75] also found the same relationships and a significant positive relationship with DP. Lloyd et al. [82] showed that with age, the level of DP decreased, while the level of PA increased in ED physicians. In the present study, a significant negative relationship was found between age and the PA level, which is due to the fact that, over time, daily work with people tends to lead to feelings of personal inadequacy and low professional self-esteem as a result of the lack of concern for the problems of others and the loss of empathy [81].",

Furthermore, no relationship was found between smoking and the dimensions of burnout. This result is similar to that obtained in ED physicians [84]. DP, in the multivariate analysis, was determined by the absence of daily physical exercise. Likewise, Goldberg et al. [85] reported that low levels of physical exercise were a predictor of burnout in ED personnel. It has been suggested that regular physical exercise facilitates psychological detachment from work and increases people\u2019s self-efficacy. As a result, ED nurses may feel more able to cope with their work duties and may find the tasks less demanding, which reduces the risk of burnout. In addition, regular physical exercise may result in the body recovering faster after exposure to stress and may induce changes in several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, leading to a better mood and increased energy, thus reducing the risk of burnout [86].",

In the multivariate analysis, PA was influenced negatively by the years worked in EDs. Working in an ED involves dealing with unexpected situations, patients who have life-threatening pathologies, and more frequent attacks or assaults than other specialized medical units, which may produce lack of assertive skills in nursing professionals and, as a result, low PA [11,87]. However, here, too, there are conflicting findings. While Popa et al. [88] found no relationship between years worked in EDs and the level of burnout, other studies have found a significant positive relationship evident in two periods, corresponding to workers in the first two years of their professional career and those with over ten years of experience. In these stages, the relationship with burnout is lower [85,89].",
