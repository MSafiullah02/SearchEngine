            "text": "We propose an efficient and accurate measure for ranking spreaders and identifying the influential ones in spreading processes in networks. While the edges determine the connections among the nodes, their specific role in spreading should be considered explicitly. An edge connecting nodes i and j may differ in its importance for spreading from i to j and from j to i. The key issue is whether node j , after infected by i through the edge, would reach out to other nodes that i itself could not reach directly. It becomes necessary to invoke two unequal weights w ij and w ji characterizing the importance of an edge according to the neighborhoods of nodes i and j . The total asymmetric directional weights originating from a node leads to a novel measure s i , which quantifies the impact of the node in spreading processes. An s-shell decomposition scheme further assigns an s-shell index or weighted coreness to the nodes. The effectiveness and accuracy of rankings based on s i and the weighted coreness are demonstrated by applying them to nine real-world networks. Results show that they generally outperform rankings based on the nodes' degree and k-shell index while maintaining a low computational complexity. Our work represents a crucial step towards understanding and controlling the spread of diseases, rumors, information, trends, and innovations in networks.",

From the perspective of the severity of a spreading process, the most influential spreaders are those resulting in a much larger final infected proportion of the whole system when the spread of a disease or a piece of information originates from them than from other nodes. Centrality measures such as the degree [1] , betweenness [2] , closeness [3] , eigenvector centrality [4] , and k-shell coreness [5] have been used to identify the most influential spreaders. The degree is the simplest measure. In social networks, for example, an individual with a large degree has more direct contact with other people and is thus likely to be more influential than one with a small degree for transmitting disease or information. Subsequent research indicates that the core nodes as identified by the k-shell decomposition are the most influential spreaders [6] . Algorithms based on other centrality measures have been proposed to improve the accuracy of identifying influential spreaders [7] [8] [9] [10] . They include the neighborhood coreness [11] , improved eigenvector centrality [12, 13] , H index [14, 15] , and nonbacktracking centrality [16] .",

            "text": "In most studies on identifying influential spreaders so far, the networks are taken to be unweighted and undirected. Each edge is treated as being equivalent in its function, as in the centrality and ranking methods [10] . However, edges in a network could be quite different [21] . In weighted networks, the weight of an edge reflects the strength of the interaction between the connected nodes, as in situations concerning the number of communications, size of trade, intimacy of friendship, frequency of cooperation, etc. [22] [23] [24] . In addition, edges may not be equally important in keeping the network robust [25] . An example is the small influence on network robustness in food web networks when redundant links are removed [26] . In terms of network functionality, differences among edges are also observed. For example, removing redundant links has no effect on network synchronization [27] , but closing specific routes in air transportation networks can minimize the spreading of a disease [28] . To quantify the weight of an edge, a class of measures relying on its importance in the network structure has been defined [29] . For example, the edge betweenness counts the number of shortest paths between any two nodes that go through the edge and it can be regarded as the weight of an edge [30] . Immunizing edges of high betweenness was found to be effective in suppressing epidemics [31] , but deleting such edges in scale-free networks would enhance the transmission efficiency dramatically [32] . In a global air transportation network, the strength of an edge that reflects the volume of passengers traveling between two airports was found to correlate positively with the product of the degree of the connected nodes. Thus, a measure w ij = (k i k j ) \u03b8 [33] was introduced as the weight of an edge. This measure has been adopted in many works for distinguishing the importance among edges in unweighted networks [34] [35] [36] .",

The sum of asymmetric weights of links originated from a node defines a measure of the strength s i of a node i, which is shown to be an efficient quantity for identifying influential spreaders with a low computational complexity.

To quantify the influence of each node on spreading, we let one node, say, node i, be infected and all the other nodes be susceptible initially.

The first term stands for the basic effect of infecting the direct neighbor j of node i through the edge. We test the result of neglecting this element and find that the ranking accuracy is not as good as keeping it, implying that the basic effect of an edge on the direct neighbor should not be neglected. The factor k out j is included to reflect the potential impact of node i through infecting its neighbor j . The product k i k out j include the degree of node i in the consideration. The idea can be illustrated by considering a leaf node (node of degree 1) connected to a hub (a node of large degree), the number of outgoing links is very large for this leaf node. However, its impact is not necessarily high because only when it and its neighboring hub are infected could the infection spread to the other part of the network. The parameter a serves to tune the contribution of k i k out j to the importance of edge e ij . The presence of (k i k out j ) a emphasizes the asymmetric importance of an edge. The weight w ij is different from w ji for the same link connecting node i and node j . From Eq. (3), w ji = 1 + (k j k out i ) a , which measures the importance of the edge e ji when a spread goes from node j to node i along the link e ji and then moves on to other parts of the network. Note that w ij = w ji generally as they are defined by considering the neighborhoods of the neighbors of node i and node j , respectively. Given a network, w ij and w ji can be evaluated entirely based on the network topology and they label every edge to better reflect the bidirectional and yet asymmetric contributions of the edge in spreading processes. There are many other ways to define the edge weight from the network topology [30, 33] . For example, the edge multiplicity is defined as the number of triangles an edge participates in Ref. [42] . This method defines the weight symmetrically in both directions and focuses on the influence of clustering, i.e., counting the number of nodes that are both first and second neighbors. This idea is partly in contrast to our method of weakening the effect of nodes that are both first and second neighbors. While the edge multiplicity focuses on the effect of spreading in the first neighborhood, our way of defining the link impact considers further steps of spreading out of the first neighborhood, thus resulting in asymmetrically defined weights.",

This list can be compared with the list based on the actual spreading efficiency by calculating Kendall's \u03c4 correlation coefficient. We calculate the ranking correlation of nodes' spreading efficiency and their strength for different values of a and obtained \u03c4 (a), as shown in Fig. 3 (squares) . For a = 0 [see Eq. (4)], s i reduces to the degree k i and thus \u03c4 (a = 0) measures the correlation between the rankings based on the degree and the spreading efficiency. Note that \u03c4 is significantly enhanced for a > 0, implying that the node strength, which includes the bidirectional and asymmetric weights of the edges, ranks the nodes more accurately. Results in Fig. 3 further show that there exists an optimal value of a for each network at which \u03c4 is a maximum. The optimal value of each network is given in Table I , together with the other network properties. Figure 3 also shows the \u03c4 (a) obtained by ranking the nodes according to the s-shell index. The results will be discussed later. Figure 4 shows the imprecision function of the ranking based on the node strength, together with the results based on the degree and k-shell index for comparison. Recall that a lower imprecision implies a higher accuracy in identifying the influential spreaders. The node strength (triangles) give an imprecision that is less than 0.1 for all p in nearly all cases. Only in the network Netsci is the imprecision slightly larger than 0.1 for a few values of p. The results show that the node strength outperforms the degree (squares) in almost all networks. Only in the network Hamster do the imprecisions based on node strength and on the degree become comparable, but they are both small. The node strength is therefore a better index for pinpointing the influential spreaders than the degree. More noticeable is that the node strength performs even better than the k-shell index in most cases, except at some small values of p in the AS and Netsci networks. The k-shell index is regarded as an efficient measure for identifying influential spreaders and it is widely used in ranking algorithms. However, the assignment of a k-shell index requires a complete network structure rather than indices relying solely on the local structure such as the degree or the node strength. The node strength introduced here provides not only a more accurate measure, but also a computationally efficient method in handling large-scale networks.",

In the Emailcontact network, s s and s rankings work equally well. In fact, the s s and s rankings approach the same value of \u03c4 as a increases. Given that the optimal values of a in the networks are less than or equal to 1, the weighted coreness gives a better ranking.

            "text": "We analyze the reason why the proposed node strength and s-shell index outperform the degree and k-shell index. First, the method proposed herein can identify weak nodes, which have a low degree but are influential spreaders [51] . For example, a node i of degree 2 has two neighbors with large outgoing links. The edges connecting i and its neighbors will be assigned a large link weight, thus resulting in a large strength, as well as a large s-shell index. If evaluated by degree and the k-shell index, node i will be ranked low as a less important node. Second, the methods proposed herein can identify nodes that are in fact not influential spreaders but are ranked high by degree and k-shell index, which form a local clique structure [39] . For example, in the real-world network CA-Hep, there exists a cliquelike local structure composed of 32 mutually connected nodes with very few outgoing links. In our methods, the edges of these nodes will be assigned low weights, due to the very few or even no outgoing links, thus having a low strength and s-shell index. If Though we use the SIR spreading dynamics to obtain the spreading influence of each node, which can be interpreted as a percolation process, previous researches have pointed out the correlation between the existence of a large component and the ratio of the average number of second and first neighbors [52, 53] . In Ref. [53] the authors indicated that clustering strongly affects the percolation properties and size of a giant component. By avoiding the edges that are responsible for clustering, the percolation properties of clustered random networks can be computed correctly. This idea is very similar to our way of defining the dynamical importance of edges, which synthesizes the first and second neighbors but neglects the nodes that are both first and second neighbors. This guarantees that the contribution of triangles is not overcounted. How to use the percolation theory to distinguish the influence of each node requires further exploration [54, 55] . For example, researchers used the optimal percolation and message-passing method to predict the spreading influence of nodes and the proposed index counts the degree of nodes that is at a certain distance from the central node [51] .",

However, the optimal value is not often known precisely in real applications. It will be useful to examine the performance of the node strength s i for some arbitrarily chosen value of a. Let us set a = 1/2 so that the term (k i k out j ) a in w ij represents a geometric mean. The comparison in Fig. 6 of the imprecision function shows that s i ranking gives a lower imprecision than the degree and k-shell index. An interesting point is that the imprecision of node strength evaluated at a = 1/2 is even lower than that evaluated at the optimal value of a in the AS network for p < 0.1. The result indicates that although the best performing overall ranking correlation coefficient occurs at some optimal a, the same value does not necessarily give the best identification of the most influential spreaders. Figure 7 compares the effectiveness of the node strength and the s-shell decomposition for a = 1/2. Again, the s-shell index works better in most cases. In fact, the results resemble those in Fig. 5 when the optimal a is used. These results further support the assertion that the node strength and the corresponding s-shell index are better measures for spreading processes than methods based on the degree. Between them, the s-shell index performs slightly better, but evaluating the index requires more computing effort than the node strength alone.",

Although an edge between nodes i and j certainly helps spread a disease, its role may be different when the infection goes from i to j than in the other direction. This is because what matters is whether the node j , after infected by i, would reach out to other nodes that node i itself could not reach. If so, the link carries a greater importance for infection from i to j , which is quantified by a higher weight w ij for the link. It is therefore necessary to invoke asymmetric and bidirectional weights with w ij = w ji for a link so as to capture the dynamics in spreading processes. Here we introduced a form of w ij [see Eq. (3)] and showed that it facilitates accurate ranking in the node's importance. Pictorially, the network is better described by the nodes connected by links with asymmetric weights in different directions when spreading dynamics is concerned. To establish the effectiveness of our method, the weights of the links were used to construct a node strength s that predicts the importance of a node in spreading processes. An s-shell decomposition scheme based on the node strength was then introduced. The s-shell index s s of the nodes provides another way of ranking them. Applying s and s s rankings to nine real-world networks, it was found that our measures generally outperform the standard rankings based on the degree of the nodes and the k-shell decomposition method. Superiority is shown in both the overall performance of the ranking as indicated by Kendall's \u03c4 correction coefficient and in identifying the influential spreaders as indicated by the imprecision.",

The weights w ij can then be used to assign a strength s to the nodes and a corresponding s-shell decomposition based on s can be carried out to assign an index s s to each node. Figure 8 compares Kendall's \u03c4 correlation of rankings based on s s and s s with the actual SIR spreading efficiency for different values of the parameter a. In all cases, the measure with asymmetric weights s s works better than that without the asymmetry. In the Emailcontact and Hamster networks, the two measures are equally accurate. The results confirm that it is important to include the different roles of a link in spreading a disease between nodes i and j in two different directions into the construction of a reliable measure. In summary, we proposed a node strength as an alternative centrality measure for efficient and accurate identification of influential spreaders. The idea of examining the functionality of a link in spreading in either direction is a general one and thus could be further developed for ranking a set of objects. As the current method only considers one step, it may be extended to further steps. Consider if node j in Fig. 1 has three outgoing nodes that are leaf nodes, while node k has only one outgoing node which further connects to many nodes. Whether taking further steps into consideration is a better choice for defining the dynamical link weights needs to be verified in future research. Previous results indicated that taking the two-step neighborhood into consideration balanced the calculation cost and ranking accuracy the best in a ranking method [56] . Although we work on defining the link weight from the network structure, it is worth considering how to integrate the artificial link weight with real weight on weighted networks. We think that the formation of a network structure depends on the function of the network elements of nodes and links.",
