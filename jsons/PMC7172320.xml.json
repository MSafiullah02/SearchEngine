However, as these models have been primarily developed for chemical agents (NHMRC, 2004), issues associated with immunity and transmission of disease are often ignored, particularly when many children are present. Some QMRA models have been applied to waterborne pathogens accounting for both immunity and person to person transmission (Eisenberg et al., 1996; Eisenberg et al., 1998 ; Soller et al., 2003). Risk in recreational waters was addressed using such a model in Soller et al. (2003). However, children should be taken into separate consideration in QMRA (Nwachuku and Gerba, 2004) as they may display attack rates higher than adults when swallowing water and submerging their head (Balbus et al., 2004). Age has also been investigated as the primary determining factor related to the type and severity of health outcomes from enterovirus exposures in recreational waters (Parkin et al., 2003); however, limited data on this subject are currently available in the peer review literature.",

To eliminate these biases, the survey lasted 4 h in the afternoon\u2014from 1 PM to 5 PM\u2014on each occasion. The sampling location \u201cMandurah Bridge Beach\u201d is located in the City of Mandurah, at the mouth of the estuary. The water recreational area was small (about 500 m2) suggesting that sampling would be close in space to the recreational users. Preliminary data showed that while indicator levels in the recreational area were higher in the afternoon than in the morning when the number of recreational users was lower, they did not significantly vary during the afternoon (data not shown). To reduce the short-term variability of the indicator (Boehm et al., 2002) duplicate samples were collected at 3 PM, on each day the survey was conducted as well as outside the bathing season. Two water samples were collected 30 cm below the surface inside the main swimming area, one of the duplicate a few metres from the \u201cupstream side\u201d of the enclosure (where the river water enters the swimming area), the second few metres from the \u201cdownstream side\u201d of the enclosure (where the river water leaves the enclosure).",

A follow-up interview was conducted by telephone 2 weeks later. Information on who swam and who became ill within the family or group was gathered on that occasion. Gastrointestinal illness (GI) was recorded whenever an individual reported two or more occurrences of loose stools per 24 h or two or more incidences of vomiting, or diarrhoea with abdominal pain, vomiting or nausea or one episode of vomiting with abdominal pain or nausea or any of two of the symptoms together (Payment et al., 1997). The symptoms of GI did not include fever to include infections such as giardiasis. The case definition of respiratory illness (RI) was similar to that of McBride et al. (1998) who did not require fever to include common cold\u2014as low-grade fever may not be noticed\u2014but who neglected hay fever and asthma. We therefore focused on viral rhinosinusitus (common cold syndrome or non-specific upper respiratory tract infection), which is an acute illness typically characterised by rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough and low grade fever (Rosenstein et al., 1998). Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the main culprit as they together account for up to 60% of these infections (Anderson et al., 1993). Ear infection was recorded only when confirmed by medical examination.",

Several studies reported frequent symptom rates in lower age groups (Cabelli et al., 1998; Fattal et al., 1997; Pr\u00fcss, 1998). We noticed high RI and GI incidence rates in very young children (less than 5 yr old). Their activity, mainly playing with wet sand above the shoreline promoted sand and water ingestion, and may have resulted in an excess of GI and RI. The GI cases observed in the age group 26\u201335 yr corresponded mainly to secondary infection by contact between parents and children.

However, QMRA provides estimates based on assumptions and extrapolations from existing data. The dose\u2013response curves used in QMRA have been generated using healthy adult volunteers without existing diseases. In this study only 31% of the recreational water users (primary contact) belonged to that category. Of the population 50% was under 15 years of age, and was therefore more susceptible to water-related illnesses (Wade et al., 2003). A large majority of these children (>90%) were wading, swimming or playing with wet sand above the shoreline. The expected relative exposure to pathogens for wading or playing with wet sand above the shoreline was expected to be different (lower) from the exposure upon which the WHO guidelines were based. However, use of the beach by diapered-children that may increase the potential for water-borne disease transmission (Carpenter et al., 1999) and presence of gulls may have resulted in higher relative exposure for playing in the wet sand. Levels of FS indicator in sand showed that beach sand may be a reservoir for pathogens (data not shown).",

This study accounted for symptoms deriving from sources excluding the recreational water, such as food, alcohol and sunbathing.",

The recreational area at Mandurah town is used by large groups of extended families (up to 61 individuals in one single group). Significant loss of follow-up can result if one group cannot be contacted. The large groups and families may also have contributed to bias in the study by creating clusters of illnesses. However, the short time frame (2 weeks) between the two interviews, and the simultaneity of symptom appearance in most cases led us to conclude that clusters were not important in our study. Furthermore Pr\u00fcss (1998) calculated that for significant results, the study population size should reach a minimum of 1700 swimmers and 1700 non-swimmers under the hypothesis of a 5% background illness rate and an excess rate of 50%. Such sample size could not be achieved in the present study, as 100 people or less were present at any time during the interview periods. The sample size may explain the absence of relationship between GI and FS in particular.",

Another issue was the impact of variables such as swimming duration, water activity, age, gender, health condition and local immunity on vulnerability to contaminated water (Machado and Mourato, 2002). The vast variation in resistance or immunity among the population makes it impossible to calculate accurately the effects of swimming in polluted waters. Miscalculation of exposure may produce an artificially low threshold for increased risk (Pr\u00fcss, 1998), and a difference in threshold could be due to a study population limited to adults (higher immune status resulting in higher threshold), or to a lower pathogen/indicator ratio. Here the threshold was quite high (251 FS per 100 ml for the whole population, 235 FS per 100 ml for children (<16 yr), and 260 per 100 ml for adults (16\u201355 yr), (see Fig. 3)), most likely due to a lower ratio between pathogen and indicator resulting from a repetitive stirring of the sediments (Youn-Joo et al., 2002).",

Furthermore, the low illness rates observed in people sick at the time of the first interview could merely indicate that people generally avoid the beach when sick and the OR of 1.6 between sick children and adults would therefore not be a reliable value for comparing background of illness. The choice of a reliable value representing background of illness is difficult as few relevant data are reported in the literature. This choice becomes even more difficult when children are involved. Background of illnesses and confounders have been mainly reported in relation to childcare attendance. Slack-Smith et al. (2004) reported rates of 0.49 per annum of AFRI in child care settings, corresponding to OR of 1.46. Fleming et al. (1987) observed 24% of upper respiratory infection (URI) and 6% of ear infection in children under 5 yr old during a period of 15 days, corresponding to ORs of 1.6 (p=0.02) and 3.8 (p=0.05), respectively, when assuming a background level of 15%. In Western Australia, more than half of children under 5 yr do not attend childcare (ABS, 1999). This, and the fact that the study was mainly conducted over summer holidays led us to assume that childcare attendance would not be an important confounder in that study, even if it may impact immune levels, therefore attack rates at relatively low FS concentrations.",

Z-test using two-tailed test (a=0.05) showed that exposure to recreational water increased significantly the incidence of respiratory illnesses for the whole population by almost a factor two (p=0.0002, p<two-tailed).
