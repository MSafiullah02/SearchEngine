The first outbreak of Zika fever was reported in 2007 on the Pacific island of Yap, this outbreak caused 108 symptomatic cases. Another epidemic outbreak occurred in French Polynesia between 2012 and 2014. During this time, it was estimated that about 28,000 people were reported to have Zika like symptoms (Anderson et al., 2016).",

As stated previously, it has been suggested that Zika virus can spread to newborns from their mothers, and we therefore feel that an accurate model must include the vertical transmission. Our work is an extension of our previous model (Imran et al., 2017) by including a population group that is using controlling measures. In the previous work, we considered death due to the infection and the total human and vector populations were functions of time. The previous model did not possess global stability for both disease-free and endemic equilibriums. We showed a backward bifurcation phenomenon. The current model has constant population size. Since death cases reported from Zika fever were negligible, we take disease-induced mortality to be zero. There is no backward bifurcation and the steady states results are global. Since the only way to control the disease is to isolate patients who have been infected with the Zika virus, we included a new population compartment consisting of hospitalized individuals. We have calculated the basic reproductive number associated with our model that guarantees the elimination of the disease. Finally, using optimal control techniques, we also propose and analyze the control strategies for decrease infected individuals while minimizing the costs and resources simultaneously.",

The human population is divided into five mutually exclusive groups, susceptible humans S\nh(t), exposed humans E\nh(t), infected humans I\nh(t), isolated or hospitalized individuals H\nh(t) and recovered humans R\nh(t). The total vector population is divided into three mutually exclusive classes comprising of susceptible vectors Sv(t), exposed vectors Ev(t) and infected vectors Iv(t). The model assumes that the susceptible human population S\nh(t) has a recruitment rate \u03bc\nh\nN\nh, where N\nh is total human population and \u03bc\nh is the natural birth rate of humans. We assume that the birth rate of human population is same as the natural death rate. Susceptible individuals get infected with Zika fever virus (due to contact with infected vectors) at a rate \u03bb\nh and thus enter the exposed class E\nh. In order to consider vertical transmission in our model, we make the assumption (see, e.g., Li et al., 2001) that a fraction of newborn individuals from parents in the E\nh(t) and I\nh(t) classes will be infected, and thus remain in E\nh class before becoming infectious. We have assumed that the hospitalized individuals do not contribute to vertical transmission. Population in each class is removed at the natural death rate \u03bc\nh. We assumed a lifelong immunity for humans who recovered from Zika virus. The exposed individuals who got an infection, move to infectious class at a rate \u03be. The infected population recovers from the Zika fever at a rate \u03b8\nI and some infected individuals are transferred to hospitalized class at a rate \u03c4. The hospitalized population recovered at a rate of \u03b8\nH.",

The only way to control this disease is to reduce the contact rate either by killing the mosquitoes or using the protective measure like mosquito repellents, nets etc. The effective contacts will be further reduced by isolating the infected humans. Isolation of individuals with disease symptoms constitutes what is probably the first infection control measure since the beginning of recorded human history (Hethcote, 2000). Over the decades, these control measures have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to combat the spread of some emerging and re-emerging diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, Ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Gumel et al., 2003, Imran et al., 2013, Lipsitch et al., 2003, Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003). Chavez et al. analyzed a SAIQR model in detail, to investigate the effect of isolation on influenza (Vivas-Barber et al., 2015). They used the isolation (quarantine) I-Q model, where the infected population is isolated.

Also, all solutions originating in X converge to N\n0 as t \u2192 \u221e. N\n0 is asymptotically stable in X. Hence N\n0 is isolated in X. Corollary 4.7 in Salceanu (2011) (where M = B \u2229 X, \u03a9(M) = {N\n0}, T = 1, P(1, N\n0) is e\nA(N0)), together with Proposition 4.1 and Lemma 3.1 in Salceanu (2011), imply that {N\n0} is also uniformly weakly repelling. Then, from Theorem 8.17 in Smith and Thieme (2011) we have that the semiflow generated by (2.4) is uniformly weakly \u03c1-persistent. From the positive invariance of B, we have that (2.4) is point dissipative. Then, according to Theorem 2.28 in Smith and Thieme (2011), there exists a compact attractor of points for (1). This, together with uniformly weakly \u03c1-persistent imply (10) (see Smith and Thieme, 2011, Theorem 5.2). In this case there exists an endemic steady state (Smith and Thieme, 2011).  \u25a1\n",

Here \u03b6 is a positive number and is defined as the maximum value attained during optimal control procedure. Our aim is to minimize the associated cost function which is given as:(15)J[\u03c4]=\u222b0TAIIh+ANNv+12W\u03c42(t)dtHere A\nI and A\nN are positive constants used to balance in the size of I(t) and Nv(t). Further, we used a nonlinear cost function in order to accommodate the impact of variety of factors associated with hospitalization, documented widely in literature, see for instance Kirschner et al. (1997). W is weight associated with quadratic cost due to hospitalization. Moreover a linear function has been chosen for cost incurred by infected individuals and the mosquitoes population. Our objective is to find an optimal control for hospitalization rate \u03c4\n*(t) such that J[\u03c4*]=min\u03c4\u03f5U   J[\u03c4]. The Lagrangian of the optimization problem is given by L=AIIh+12W\u03c42(t).

W depends on the relative importance of the control measures in mitigating the spread of the disease as well as the cost incurred (such as material resources and human effort) during the implementation of control measure per unit time. Pontrayagin's Maximum Principal converts model (1) and objective function (16) into minimizing the Hamiltonian (17) with respect to \u03c4. Now we prove the following theorem to elicit the effect of optimal control of hospitalization.Theorem 5.1\nThere exists a unique optimal control \u03c4\n*(t) which minimizes J over\nU\n.

Also, the solutions of our model are bounded above. In addition, it is verifiable that the model has the Lipschitz property with respect to the state variables. Using the properties mentioned above along with corollary 4.1 of Fleming and Rishel (1975), the existence of an optimal control is established.Now using the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we obtain\nd\u03d51dt=\u2212\u2202H*\u2202Sh,\u03d51(T)=0d\u03d52dt=\u2212\u2202H*\u2202Eh,\u03d52(T)=0\u22ee\u22ee\u22eed\u03d58dt=\u2212\u2202H*\u2202Iv,\u03d58(T)=0evaluated at the optimal control which results in the above stated adjoint system. The optimality condition is \u2202H\u2202\u03c4=0. Therefore on the set {T : 0 < \u03c4\n*(T) < \u03b6} we obtain\u03c4*(t)=Ih(\u03d53\u2212\u03d54)W\n",

The optimal strategy is obtained by solving the optimal system consisting of both the state system as well as the adjoint system. Since there are initial conditions present for the state equations, we start solving them with a guess for \u03c4 using the fourth-order forward Runge-Kutta method. The adjoint equations are then solved using the fourth-order backward Runge-Kutta method because of the presence of final conditions. Then, the controls are updated by using a convex combination of the previous control and the value from the characterization given above. This process is repeated until we obtain a desired accuracy of convergence (Fig. 7\n).",

It is shown that the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive number (R\n0) is less than 1. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction number R\n0 exceeds unity.
