Genome-based studies recently became much more affordable, providing enhanced discriminatory power for microbial surveillance. However, use of the bioinformatics tools needed to analyze these large amounts of sequence data is a challenge for surveillance laboratories and research laboratories alike. Dag Harmsen (Universit\u00e4tsklinikum M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany) opened the session by giving an overview of concepts and available software tools for rapid HTS analysis in clinical and public health microbiology. He elaborated on the current switch from traditional typing tools, which are standardized and broadly used but provide only partial information, to more complete genome-wide approaches [23]. Genome-based approaches promise to increase the capacity to discriminate isolate genotypes to its theoretical maximum, providing possibilities that have been lacking thus far, e.g. for outbreak investigation. This change in scale not only refines the resolution of microbial characterization, but also opens up novel opportunities, such as identifying individual transmission events [36], [24]. The challenges of HTS include the need for development of large storage capacity and databases and for standardization. Various genome-based characterization methods exist, from multi-species to lineage specific ones. The species-specific standard multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach is expected to remain useful as strain nomenclature is well known and this provides a basis on which to build genome typing approaches [22].",

Any number of sequences, from single genes to complete genomes, can be linked to isolate data. The system also includes a sequence and profile definition database, which allows the grouping of loci into schemes. Schemes can include varying numbers of genes and range from MLST data to whole genome schemes. In addition, schemes with particular purposes such as virulence or resistance-associated elements or pan-genome schemes for a species can be defined, searched and tagged in a set of genomic sequences; this process was termed \u2018population annotation\u2019. Additional BIGSdb functionality, called the Genome Comparator, enables rapid comparison of genomes based on user-selected schemes.

Hannes Pouseele (Applied-Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) presented his work entitled \u201cOptimized whole genome MLST [wgMLST] versus whole genome SNP [wgSNP] typing in NGS-based epidemiological surveillance\u201d. As wgMLST uses defined loci, which generally only include the coding sequences, intergenic regions are not considered; therefore, important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be overlooked. Comparing 26 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, the authors found 347 SNPs by a whole-genome mapping approach, with some regions of the genome being unmappable due to repeated sequences. wgMLST included 4018 genes, but 47 were removed as they included repeated sequences, which led to difficulties in assembly, mapping and/or allele calling. Further, different calls of alleles were found in some pairs of strains believed to be identical, which was attributed to paralogous sequences. Although this issue could be solved in the future using genomic localization information, nearly 10% of the genes were removed from the analysis. Overall, the resolution of wgMLST was found to be similar to wgSNP.",

The Outbreak Genomics and Epidemiology session covered a wide range of topics along this theme, from the practicalities of integrating whole genome sequencing into existing infrastructure, to an example where inference from genome sequences conflicted with national health policies. Jonathan Green (Public Health England [PHE], Colindale, UK) described progress in establishing a centralized sequencing service at PHE to monitor and track outbreaks of infectious diseases. Although HTS technology is rapidly evolving, PHE believes that current technology is robust enough to make investment worthwhile, even though costs are very large and an overhaul of the existing infrastructure is required. The need for robotics, a specialized staff, bioinformatics support, expensive hardware as well as training services was underlined. Priority areas were identified, such as emergency response and a small number of pathogens of high public health importance. Using Streptococcus pneumoniae as a case study, J. Green asked whether HTS could replace the current serotyping system. Whilst there is a very high correlation between sequence and serotype, a small number of cases are hard to resolve, but this should hopefully change in the future by building a bank of reference serotypes. This early experience was judged very positive, but automation and validation of this novel approach are likely to take time and to bring up many new issues such as data sharing and the ethics of using HTS data in legal cases.",

Using 957 genomes from Oxfordshire infection cases over a 3.6-year period, Tim Peto (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) and colleagues examined the relationships among isolates in individual hospitals [9]. A genetic threshold of epidemiological linkage was defined based on the whole dataset. Using this threshold (>10 SNPs), the authors showed that 45% of cases were not epidemiologically related and that only 35% could be conclusively linked. Of the latter, 38% could be explained by patterns of patient contact. These results imply that the majority of cases may be unrelated and are actually coming from asymptomatic carriage or some unknown environmental reservoir. C. difficile infection may therefore be a wider public health problem, with within-hospital transmission playing a smaller role than current consensus opinion suggests.",

Based on the eloquent example of Salmonella, it was shown how most of the >1500 serovars are probably polyphyletic (i.e. have multiple founding ancestors), due to horizontal genetic exchange and environmental selection for certain serotype antigens. In spite of this, serotyping remains the most commonly used Salmonella typing method in public health laboratories. M. Achtman strongly advocated forgetting serotyping of Salmonella, given its poor phylogenetic value and other limitations [1]. The power of genomics to investigate outbreaks and genome dynamics within a single serovar was then illustrated on Salmonella enterica serovar Agona, which caused multiple outbreaks in recent years. In particular, it was shown that identical types that are defined based on SNPs can have very different PFGE patterns because of bacteriophage integration [48], questioning the reliability of PFGE as a strain typing method.",

STs were distributed among three clades, which could be broadly classified as containing (i) human commensal strains; (ii) animal-associated strains; and (iii) nosocomial strains. Whole genome sequencing of 25 isolates with varying vancomycin resistance levels was consistent with an evolutionary scenario whereby lineages originating in animals, not from human commensal carriage, entered the hospital environment and are circulating. This was associated with the acquisition of different van genes through horizontal gene transfer and followed by the epidemic rise of VRE in the Netherlands.",

Their initial evolution from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), following cross-species transmission was estimated at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century for the major groups. The study of strain diversity in humans revealed how several subtypes of HIV subsequently arose from founder events and how social factors, sexual practices, geographical constraints and political forces influenced their diversification and spread. As an example, dispersion of the HIV1-C subtype was linked to the copper belt corridor (southern and southeastern Africa), whereas HIV1-B migrated from the Congo to the US through Haiti in two main historical steps: after the Congo acquired independence in the 1960 and during the gay movement emancipation in the 1970's [14]. Likewise, one HIV2 lineage went through a founder effect out of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, with a probable effect on the HIV 2 epidemic of socio-cultural changes induced by the war of independence in Guinea-Bissau [30].

Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5), a serotype of the enterovirus B species, is mainly involved in mild infections that can, in some cases, induce fever, meningitis, and even myocarditis. The occurrence of this common enterovirus follows a seasonal epidemic pattern. To gain insights into the tempo and mode of evolution that sustain the genetic diversity of CVB5 and its interplay with virus transmission, 218 virus samples were investigated. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed two distinct CVB5 genogroups. Genogroup B was estimated to have been co-circulating with genogroup A over the last 50 years. A coalescence study revealed three peaks of genetic diversity, in 2000, 2003 and 2006. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that the evolutionary processes responsible for the diversity of viral protein 1 were different between the two genogroups: in genogroup A changes were distributed all along the phylogeny, while in genogroup B all changes were mapped at the origin of the clade. These differences were attributed to the immune selective pressure of the host. Finally, it was suggested that environmental samples and pediatric as well as asymptomatic cases should be considered for a more complete understanding of the epidemiological pattern of enterovirus infections.",

However, it was also pointed out that identifying virulence factors from whole genome sequences can be complex, and quantifying the different effects of the bacterium and host in the manifestation of virulence is needed. Siv Andersson (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden) provided a genomic perspective on the adaptive radiation of the emerging pathogen Bartonella\n[20] in her talk \u201cThe ecological context of pathogens and the evolutionary dynamics of their virulence genes\u201d. There are three distinct phylogenetic clades of Bartonella, each roughly associated with a different host type: a ruminant group; a cat and rodent group; and a human, cat, dog and rodent group. Adaptation to humans appears to have evolved twice. Mapping the dynamic gene flux of Bartonella across the species phylogeny, Andersson's group identified a gene transfer agent (GTA) containing a phage-derived origin of replication, located near a secretion system cassette. This GTA is being transferred between different strains of Bartonella, suggesting a role in host adaptation. An example of transfer of the secretion system was found between a dog-adapted strain and a cat-adapted strain. The dissemination of host-specific genes could have been important in the successful adaptation of Bartonella to different host groups. In humans, modification of the existing gene pool through gene loss was observed, but no novel human-specific gene was found, which may be explained by the high genetic homogeneity of the population.",

Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are often phenotypically and genotypically distinct from commensal E. coli isolates. However, some are superficially indistinguishable from commensals, and others even resemble intra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC) or other extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). This highlights the need for better typing of E. coli isolates. U. Dobrindt showed that MLVA offers better resolution than MLST, but it is still unable to ambiguously distinguish the different pathotypes. The distribution of genes encoding autotransporter proteins, known to contribute to virulence, was determined from the sequencing of 111 whole genomes. Whilst their distribution correlates with phylogeny, these genes also do not appear to be reliable biomarkers of pathotypes. In fact, there was little pathotype distinction even using whole genome sequences, perhaps highlighting the specific host contribution to clinical outcome.",

This genus is responsible for outbreaks of acute respiratory illness in humans, as it is transmitted by inhalation of aerosolized contaminated water. Natural reservoirs of Legionella are amoebas from lakes and rivers. Serogroup 1 of Legionella pneumophila alone is responsible for 90% of infections. C. Buchrieser showed that the different serogroups did not cluster together in a phylogeny based on whole genome sequences. This is attributed to horizontal transfer of the lipopolysaccharide cluster between genetically different strains. In France, two serogroup 1 clones are responsible for 30% of disease cases. Interestingly, these clones have horizontally acquired a thiocyanate hydrolase gene. As thiocyanate compounds are used to clean water circuits, this acquisition may represent an adaptation to this specific niche [16].",

The necessity to evaluate the clonality of bacterial isolates from within patients up to the international level was stressed, and commonly used tools were reviewed. Although PFGE has been recognized as the \u201cgold standard\u201d typing method, MLST represented a very significant improvement in molecular typing, as it allowed for the definition of major emerging clones of key organisms in the group of CRE, E. coli and K. pneumoniae\n[8].

The second part of the talk illustrated key data on the international epidemiology of selected CRE, tracing their spread and dissemination [39]. The major focus lay on the clonal structure of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, which harbor many different plasmids carrying a plethora of different bla\nKPC genes.

Despite the fact that 12 Lyssavirus species can infect a large range of hosts, including numerous Chiroptera species, more than 98% of human infections are due to the dog-adapted rabies virus (RABV), transmitted through dog bites. The study of nucleoproteins and glycoproteins allowed exploration of the spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies in dogs and the processes responsible for its maintenance and re-emergence. The most recent common ancestor of RABV was estimated to have circulated on the Indian subcontinent 1500 years ago. The main drivers of canid RABV phylogeography are genetic drift and population subdivision. In Africa, anthropogenic factors contributed to the spatial distribution of RABV. Moroccan and Algerian strains were clearly clustered separately, indicating that political boundaries were acting as efficient barriers to gene flow. Road distance is associated with RABV diversity, with human-mediated dispersal being inferred as a dominant factor in strain exchange between large cities. The periodic introduction of new lineages into cities leads to limited but recurrent outbreaks. Vaccination is a pivotal element for rabies control, but control of dog populations should also be implemented.",

VIRO-Typened is a web-based database tool where laboratories enter sequence-based information together with clinical and epidemiological data [27]. The usefulness of this enterovirus (EV) surveillance tool in the Netherlands and its value in the detection of clinically relevant types was evaluated in comparison to classical surveillance [38]. It offers an infrastructure on a national basis to aid poliovirus eradication and to improve EV surveillance, prevent outbreaks and provide better patient management. In the future, submission of clinical data should provide a more in-depth analysis of type-specific illnesses. Analysis of clusters of human parechoviruses was also presented, where molecular sequence data enabled analysis of possible immune divergent strains.",

However, the unsatisfied need of combining high discriminatory power, accuracy, ease of use, low cost or speed drives a continuous search for new methodologies. Repetitive DNA motifs in bacterial genomes constitute important targets for microbial typing. In the first two talks of this session, characterization of the variability of the spacer content of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci was presented as a valuable typing approach for two major human pathogens, S. enterica and group B Streptococcus (GBS). CRISPR loci, known to provide immunity against mobile genetic elements in some bacteria, consist of several non-contiguous direct repeats separated by stretches of variable sequences named spacers, and are often adjacent to cas (CRISPR-associated) genes, a set of conserved functional protein-coding genes [35]. Francois-Xavier Weill (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) presented \u201cCRISPR markers for Salmonella epidemiology\u201d as a new method to perform real-time simultaneous typing and subtyping of all referred Salmonella isolates [10]. As already discussed, the current standard, serotyping, is laborious and has limitations in subtyping isolates from two highly prevalent serotypes, Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Spacer content was strongly correlated with both serotype and MLST. The study of 150 Typhimurium strains showed that spacer microevolution discriminated numerous subtypes within these prevalent serotypes. Further, a high-throughput assay for Typhimurium and its monophasic variant, the CRISPOL method, was developed based on spacer presence/absence using Luminex technology. CRISPOL is now routinely used and its database includes 450 types from 6000 isolates.",

As was the case for Salmonella, Streptococcus agalactiae has two CRISPR loci in the genome. The CRISPR1 was sequenced in 351 GBS, non-redundant isolates previously characterized by CPS and MLST [33]. CRISPR1 trailer-end spacer content was found to be highly concordant with MLST. In contrast, the distribution of more recent spacers distinguished STs or specific lineages within the hypervirulent clonal complexes CC17 or CC23. The method was validated in a blind test with more than 100 GBS clinical isolates and was able to determine the ST of 95% of the isolates. It was concluded that CRISPR sequencing in GBS, with around 900 described spacers to date, proves to be rapid, accurate and cost-effective.",

Surveillance of Salmonella infections requires high-resolution systems that detect outbreak and guide prospective interventions. A total of 8936 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) isolates were genotyped between January 2008 and December 2010, with the overwhelming majority of isolates belonging to only two phage types (PT), PT170 (44.6%) and PT135 (13.9%) [43]. STM isolates were further subtyped using a five-loci MLVA scheme [32], distinguishing 1562 MLVA patterns. Isolates from epidemiologically linked patients showed indistinguishable MLVA patterns. A cluster of infection was defined by \u22655 isolates with identical MLVA patterns obtained within a four-week period, with 50% of the isolates having been recovered in a restricted geographic area [43]. An illustration of the investigation of two outbreaks was presented. Isolates from one of these were further investigated by HTS, showing only 1 to 2 SNP differences.

Along with the increasing availability of whole genome data come significant data analysis challenges. Inspired by solutions to similar challenges in human genetics, S. Sheppard presented a method by which bacterial isolate genome sequences are divided into 30 bp reads and segregated by phenotype. The model, which takes into account the isolate phylogeny, is alignment-free and simultaneously identifies variation in the core and accessory genome. This approach enables identifying features that are significantly associated with any phenotype. These features can be mapped to a finished genome to identify phenotype-associated genes or genetic elements that are candidates for adaptation to specific niches. S. Sheppard and his colleagues applied the method to identify factors responsible for adaptation of Campylobacter to cattle and chickens, as host switching is an important feature in the pathogenesis of zoonotic organisms such as Campylobacter. A seven-gene region was found. Genes in this region were almost universally present in cattle isolates, but were frequently absent in isolates from chickens and wild birds. Three of the seven genes encoded vitamin B5 biosynthesis and isolates from cattle were better able to grow in vitamin B5-depleted media. The different diets of cattle and chickens may have provided the selective pressure leading to this trait. This method will be widely applicable to other bacterial pathogens in order to understand the genetic basis of phenotype variation.",

Three M. tuberculosis isolates belonging to the original outbreak and five control isolates were sequenced to identify mutations unique to the outbreak strain. Two outbreak-specific mutations were incorporated into a strain-specific TaqMan genotyping assay, which was used to screen all available MTB patient isolates recovered in the Canton of Bern from 1991 to 2011 (1642 isolates). This allowed identification of 79 outbreak-derived isolates from 68 patients, differing by up to 19 SNPs. Subclusters descending from the 1992 outbreak, as well as potential superspreaders, were identified, and at least six drug-resistance-associated mutations were detected. This SNP typing approach provides a cost-effective way of identifying outbreak isolates within a large strain collection, and demonstrated the legacy of the 1992 outbreak among subsequent TB infections.",

The rapid evolution of human influenza A viruses is driven by a combination of progressive sequence changes in antigenic determinants and infrequent reassortment of the genomes with those of highly distinct animal influenza viruses. A. Hay described how the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (and the former Global Influenza Surveillance Network) coordinated by the WHO functions as a highly responsive global cooperative mechanism that provides the basis for biannual recommendations on vaccine composition, and the early detection of and rapid response to novel influenza virus infections. Recent zoonotic infections have increased awareness of the pandemic potential of deadly influenza variants, such as H5N1 or H7N9. The strong demand for transparency of available information, and especially of genome sequence data, led to the establishment in 2008 of the GISAID EpiFlu database, in order to promote responsible sharing of all influenza virus sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data. The EpiFlu database now includes sequences from nearly 100,000 influenza viruses and has two key founding principles. First, submitters are committed to provide data with no restrictions on their use, while retaining ownership. At the same time, users of data are committed to acknowledge the providers and make every effort to collaborate with them. A.
