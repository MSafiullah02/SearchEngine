The main theme of the report is ethical, balancing the rights of volunteers with the needs of the community, and the possible benefits arising from understanding the mechanisms of microbial disease, and how to fight it. The case for undertaking these types of studies is overwhelming, but so are the requirements to get the studies and their aftermath right.",

Between 1946 and 1989, the Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit (near Salisbury in Wiltshire, UK) did 1006 studies, mostly on 19 911 male and female volunteers (with several thousands volunteering for experiments many times).2, 3 Thanks to the efforts of the staff and volunteers we know that the cold is a syndrome caused by very many different agents and we have what I call \u201cTyrrell's rule of three\u201d. In any given year, a third of upper respiratory infections will have no known cause. A third will be caused by a mixture of agents: this third consists of all known agents, with the exception of rhinoviridae, which cause the remaining third.PanelAchievements of Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit in challenge studies in volunteers 1946\u201389 (from interviews with the late Dr David Tyrrell in February, 2000)\n\u2022Defined causes of common cold\u2014mainly in succession of advances in methods of viral isolation, recognition, culture, and successful human-to-human transmission experiments. Towards the end, strong psychological component was recognised.\u2022Described immune responses to common cold\u2014in laboratory assessment of volunteers' responses.\u2022Produced effective vaccines against common cold and attenuated common cold agents in vaccines\u2014this vaccine activity was less successful, because of multiviral aetiology of common cold. Some vaccines against influenza, rhinovirus, and other agents of common cold were produced.\u2022Assessed effects of natural and synthetic antiviral agents. This assessment activity was done in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies producing compounds.\u2022Assessed effects of environmental interventions (such as local hyperthermia) on prevention or attenuation of common cold.\n",

The sections on recruitment and safety of volunteers, the surrounding community, and researchers seem the strongest and most detailed. The recommendations for the creation of a National Expert Advisory Committee to oversee all challenge studies and the institution of a national register are sensible. Researchers will also be grateful for other pointers, such as those about adequate insurance cover. Other crucial parts are, in my view, vague and miss a golden opportunity for moving our knowledge and safeguards further.",

The national register of studies should be expanded to include a confidential depository of all records to do with all challenge studies. Why? Because we do not know what requirements there will be in the future. Historical cohorts of volunteers exposed to microbes and their unexposed controls with their records, tissues (a well-detailed part of the report), and possible follow-up could help answer future questions. Because there are several past and present challenge studies (listed in the report), we should also try our best to obtain as much evidence as possible from these studies and link up internationally similar registers. The idea is to squeeze every drop of evidence from existing animal and human studies.",
