This family can be divided into four genera, \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b2-CoVs, \u03b3-CoVs, and \u03b4-CoVs. 2 CoV in humans are common (Table 1) , often associated with mild cold symptoms, and include the \u03b1-CoVs HCoV-229E 3 and HCoV-NL63, 4 and the \u03b2-CoVs HCoV-OC43 5 and HCoV-HKU1. 6 In addition, to date three high pathogenic CoVs (all \u03b2-CoVs) are recognized in humans and characterized by moderate (MERS-CoV) or high (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) transmission rates and association with mortality ( 13 Interestingly, all currently recognized high pathogenic CoVs in humans appear to have spilled over from bats or other wildlife sources. 14 Therefore, concerns for further interspecies transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other species may be justified. (Table 1) . As outlined, pigs have their own range of CoVs and humans have their own range of CoVs with no apparent overlap.",

Virus isolation was unsuccessful; RNA was detected in blood from pigs and chickens and virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in two pigs. The authors concluded that chickens and pigs likely do not play a role in virus amplification. 25 Recognized natural hosts of MERS-CoV include dromedaries and camels. 26, 27 To further investigate the potential of other species to amplify MERS-CoV, llamas, pigs, sheep, and horses were experimentally infected. 28 Specifically, these species received MERS-CoV intranasally using a mucosal atomization device. Nasal and rectal swabs were collected over time, and MERS-CoV RNA and antigen and virus could be detected in nasal swabs from llamas and pigs. The authors concluded that MERS-CoV circulation in animals other than dromedaries, such as llamas and pigs, is not negligible. 28 From the obtained data available today, it would appear pigs can carry SARS-CoV and develop antibodies. Furthermore, evidence exists that pigs can amplify MERS-CoV. So far there is no evidence that pigs can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or are capable to amplify the virus. However, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has just emerged and is ongoing any testing currently focuses on identifying infected people to prevent further human-to-human transmissions.",

In human CoV studies, it has been shown that RNA can be detected by PCR in serum or plasma obtained from patients with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and also SARS-CoV-2 infections. 30 In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in a patient's stool sample. 31 It is presently unknown if these events resemble just leakage of viral particles or fragments or if the virus can replicate outside the respiratory tract. 30 The risk associated with human blood for transmission to other people is unknown, but blood donations are not practiced in high-risk areas where infections are ongoing and it is recommended to measure the body temperature of blood donors prior to blood donation. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is emerging and spreading at a high rate in the human population. Due to the large number of infected people often with high virus loads, SARS-CoV-2 could potentially spill over in other species including pigs and this should be monitored closely.",
