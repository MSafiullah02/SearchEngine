Although antibiotic resistance has increasingly become a recognized problem in pneumonia, older age and underlying disease, not antibiotic resistance, are more important factors in mortality.1\n",

These objective measures of severity should be supplemented by subjective factors, such as the ability to take medications safely and reliably. Clients with septic shock should be directly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for vasopressors, intubation, and mechanical ventilation.

Chest radiographs may also be useful in identification of causative agent, prognosis, alternative diagnoses, and associated conditions. In cases when the chest X-ray is not definitive, although the client's toxic condition is suggestive of pneumonia, it may be prudent to treat presumptively for 24 hours and repeat the imaging in 1 to 2 days.

Exceptions to this recommendation, such as influenza that can be tested using rapid point-of-care tests, do exist. Specific recommendations for additional diagnostic testing are provided in Table 3\n. Suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), fungal infections, avian influenza, and disease caused by agents used in bioterrorism should be verified with further diagnostic testing. Moreover, in situations when antibiotic treatment would likely be altered, investigation for specific causative agents should be undertaken, especially when the presence of specific pathogens is suspected based on the clinical presentation. This allows the clinician to narrow or completely alter antibiotic therapy, improving the likelihood of treatment success. Clearly, extensive diagnostic testing should be indicated for critically ill clients, and the guideline provides additional information about the circumstances in which other testing, such as blood cultures, respiratory tract specimen Gram stain and culture, and antigen tests, should be done.",

Other factors to consider in selection include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, compliance, safety, and cost. Local susceptibility patterns, if available from local or state health departments, should be considered in antibiotic selection. When the specific pathogen(s) is known, antimicrobial therapy should be directed toward that causative agent (Table 6\n).1 Clients should be treated with antibiotics for at least 5 days, be afebrile for 48 to 72 hours, and have no more than one sign of clinical instability (heart rate \u2264 100 beats/minute, respiratory rate \u2264 24 breaths/minute, systolic blood pressure \u2265 90 mm Hg, arterial oxygen saturation \u2265 90% or partial pressure of oxygen \u2265 60 mm Hg on room air, ability to maintain oral intake, normal mental status).
