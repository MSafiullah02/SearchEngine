This can be accomplished based on professional expertise, direct observation, photography, video recording, or drawing the activity. JHA should involve the workers who perform the activity because they have experience with how the work activity is performed, and their participation can increase their personal hazard awareness and concurrence with the outcome.9 Human factors engineers are trained to disaggregate work activities into discrete tasks and motions and should be included if possible.7 Related paradigims, such as failure mode and effect analysis, which focus on opportunities for deviation from standard work practices, may also be helpful.",

The most relevant performance test for this hazard is class D3 of the American National Standards Institute and the International Safety Equipment Association Z78, 1-2015 standard.15 Class D3 devices feature indirect ventilation to prevent penetration of projected liquids. Eye and face protection are distinguished by the extent of facial coverage, potential for projected liquids to by-pass the equipment, and potential for workers to reach under or around the equipment and touch (self-contaminate) their face or eyes. For example, goggles with solid side shields (class D3 devices) have a tight seal to the face, cannot be penetrated by spray, and are difficult to circumvent by the wearer; however, they cover only the eyes. In contrast, full face shields cover the whole face; however, they are not tight-fitting, and allow projected liquids and HCP to reach the face. If the severity of disease is such that no exposure can be tolerated, a hood or a shroud with an integrated visor that covers the face and head should be selected, as these devices can be made of fluid-impermeable textile. Eye and face protection should be selected with consideration for corrective eyewear.",

The level of protection provided by respirators is defined by the assigned protection factor (ie, the ratio of the contaminant concentration outside the respirator to the concentration inside the respirator) and varies substantially between respirator designs. The relative performance of different types of respirators has not been widely considered in health care. This is indicated by recommendations that call for an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), with a loose-fitting hood for use with the same infectious disease in the same setting. The protection offered by the PAPR, however, is 2.5-fold greater than that offered by the N95 FFR, and would offer substantially more protection to HCP.16, 17 In general, if there is concern about eye and face protection, a full facepiece respirator or a PAPR with a loose-fitting hood or helmet may be preferred, as goggles can adversely affect the fit of N95 FFRs and face shields are susceptible to being by-passed by splash or touch. Facial hair interferes with the seal of tight-fitting respirators; therefore, if enforcement of facial hair policies is not feasible or undesirable, a PAPR with a loose-fitting hood should be considered.",

Elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods offer better respiratory protection and more facial coverage against splash than FFRs. Given the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the higher level of protection afforded by a PAPR with a loose-fitting hood may be warranted. The JHA also indicated that contamination of the torso, arms, and hands is likely. Body and hand coverings should be used because, although SARS-CoV does not infect through the dermis, contaminated clothing and skin may serve as an environmental reservoir. Given the relatively short duration and limited fluid volume produced during intubation of SARS patients, fluid-impermeable gowns may not be required, particularly if HCP are able to rapidly doff soiled body coverings and perform hand hygiene.",

Aerosols formed during intubation may be inhaled by an HCP into the nares, or transferred to the nares during self-contact with hands contaminated during the procedure; the torso and arms may be contaminated with respiratory secretions (Table 2). Unless the HCP has an open wound or indwelling device, there is low risk of developing infection from exposures associated with intubation. PPE is necessary to prevent contamination of HCP clothing and skin, which could serve as an environmental reservoir for future transmission. Colonization of HCP rarely leads to overt symptoms; however, protection of the nares with a mask or respirator could decrease the risk of colonization or further transmission.

However, PPE is the default strategy in health care, as reflected in the standard and transmission-based infection control precautions.1 This makes it particularly important that the PPE be chosen with caution and reason. The rationale for PPE selection is not always transparent, which means that decision making will be neither reproducible nor convincing to HCP. This issue was apparent in the changing guidelines for PPE during the 2014-2015 EVD.5 The risk-based approach we propose in this study enables transparent decision-making, even in the face of uncertainty or disagreement, because each step of the approach can be documented, allowing review (and critique) by others.",

Product evaluation tests typically involve only components of the PPE (eg, the penetration of fluid through the textile, not the seams in the garment or performance in the field),18, 19 and federal agency representiatives and others have been called on to test the permeability of textiles to specific infectious agents.37 Although there is room to improve the realism of this type of product testing, it is equally important to evaluate how PPE ensembles perform in the field, where human behavior and individual pieces of PPE influence protection. The 2014-2015 EVD outbreak motivated substantial research about the potential for self-contamination associated with doffing complex PPE ensembles,26 and more work about ensemble performance during care activities. Hall et al38 evaluated 5 PPE ensembles intended for use with suspected EVD patients, using a complex health care activity simulation with fluorescent simulated body fluids, and found contamination under the PPE and other flaws with all ensembles tested. Herlihey et al14 evaluated 7 PPE ensembles designed for use with highly infectious diseases, using a human factors lens, and found problems with protection, comfort, and function of all ensembles testing during simulated care activities or doffing. This research highlights that existing pieces of PPE are imperfect and should be evaluated for performance before implementation. Although sophisticated, formal research methods can be used, a lot of information can be gained with fewer resources. For example, in the Chicago area, HCP used visual inspection and colored liquids (eg, Kool-Aid [The Kraft-Heinz Co]) to evaluate dermal coverage and fluid impermeability of PPE, respectively, to increase confidence in PPE selection decisions during EVD preparations.5\n",
