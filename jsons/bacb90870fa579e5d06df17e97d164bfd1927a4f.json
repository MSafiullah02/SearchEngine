An epidemiological investigation was carried out by the authors between November 2010 and July 2011, leading to the implication of a commercial dietary supplement as the potential cause for this outbreak. The components of this product were first tested in a cell culture model and two of them (dietary chestnut extract and glycerol monolaurate) showed a cytotoxic effect. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of supplemental feeding of both components alone or in combination on liver function in newborn calves on a commercial dairy farm. Ten calves were enrolled in each of the three treatment groups and the control group (group O) following a blocked design. Treatment consisted of supplementation with chestnut extract at 0.02% of birth body mass (BM) (group C), supplementation with glycerol monolaurate at 0.006% of BM (group G) or a combined treatment (group CG) for five consecutive days. The effect of treatments on liver function was evaluated clinically and by measurement of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities as well as the determination of the concentrations of glucose, L-lactate and total bilirubin in serum. There was a significant increase in GLDH and AST activities and a significant decrease in glucose concentration in treatment groups C and CG compared with the control group (p \u2264 0.035), whereas no difference was shown for group G. Survival was significantly decreased in groups C (p = 0.029) and CG (p = 0.001) compared with both group G and the control group.

The results of an epidemiological survey carried out in Bavaria between November 2010 and July 2011, followed by a preliminary feeding trial carried out by the authors suggested a causal involvement of a commercially available dietary supplement used for prevention and treatment of diarrhoea in neonatal calves (Metzner et al., 2012) . Detailed information about the epidemiological investigations and the preliminary feeding trial with this dietary supplement can be found elsewhere (Metzner et al., 2012) . The investigation of acetonitrile-water extracts of each component of the dietary supplemental feed in the MTT assay according to Reubel et al. (1989) [reduction in a yellow tetrazolium salt to violet formazan by cellular enzymes using human epidermoid cancer cells (Hep2-cells)] revealed a cytotoxic effect of two of the 12 tested components (chestnut extract and glycerol monolaurate). Chestnut extract is obtained by water extraction of the chestnut wood (Castanea sativa) and is mainly composed of tannins, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and mineral salt (Graziani and Tosi, 2006) .

GLDH is considered to be a liver-specific enzyme and effective biomarker of acute hepatic injury with activity in hepatocytes ten times higher than in other tissues. It is released in cases of hepatocellular necrosis (Thomas, 2005) and therefore of great value for indication of liver disease in adult cattle as well of liver dystrophy in calves (Hunter et al., 2013) . The significant increase in serum GLDH activity in calves from group C and CG indicates acute hepatic injury. Despite the fact that elevation of AST may be due to conditions not involving the liver, it is considered to be a sensitive biomarker of liver cell injury in cattle (Sattler and Fuerll, 2004) . The significant difference of activity of AST between groups C and O on days 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, as well as between groups CG and O on day 8 indicates hepatocellular damage in the two treatment groups that included feeding of chestnut extract. Although total serum bilirubin is not considered to be a sensitive indicator of hepatic dysfunction (Pratt and Kaplan, 2007) , elevation of total bilirubin concentration is frequently documented in cases of hepatocellular necrosis in cattle (Raposo et al., 1998) . Hence, the significant increase in concentration of total bilirubin in group C on day 9 and 10 indicates a liver dysfunction which supports the evidence that chestnut extract alone or in combination might be the causal factor.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 425, "text": "(Thomas, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 540, "end": 561, "text": "(Hunter et al., 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 839, "end": 865, "text": "(Sattler and Fuerll, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1236, "text": "(Pratt and Kaplan, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1374, "text": "(Raposo et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Elevated concentration of L-lactate within the first 48 h of life followed by a decrease as shown in Fig. 5 has been documented in cattle by several authors (Egli and Blum, 1998) . According to Steinhardt et al. (1995) , elevation of L-lactate concentration can be a consequence of an increase in production due to hypoxia and enhanced sympathetic activity due to stress around the time of birth. More importantly, elevation of concentration of L-lactate is known to be a result of inhibition of mitochondrial function by certain drugs which impair both beta-oxidation and the respiratory chain enzymes, and is a hallmark of mitochondrial impairment (Scatena et al., 2007) and hepatocellular dysfunction (Pratt and Kaplan, 2007) . Elevation of the concentration of L-lactate is also seen in severely dehydrated calves suffering from acute diarrhoea (Tennant et al., 1968) . We cannot determine with certainty whether the increase in concentration of L-lactate in treatment groups C and CG was a direct consequence of hepatic failure or if it was due to dehydration as a consequence of acute diarrhoea. However, as only three calves were severely dehydrated, it seems likely that the substantial increase in the concentration of L-lactate in group C and CG was a direct consequence of hepatocellular dysfunction. Neonatal diarrhoea can lead to abnormal posture and behaviour in calves. In several cases, this may be due to septicaemia (Fecteau et al., 1997) or Dlactataemia (Lorenz, 2004) . However, similar abnormalities have also been documented in cases of hepatic encephalopathy (Buczinski et al., 2007) . As all calves in this study suffered from diarrhoea to some extent, the cause for abnormal posture and behaviour scores cannot be determined. Abnormalities in the central nervous system of calves can be due to hypoglycaemia (Leifer and Peterson, 1984) as well as hepatic failure among other reasons (Mayhew, 2009) . Several authors highlight the effect of low ambient temperature and the resulting hypothermia on glucose level in newborn calves (Diesch et al., 2004) . Temperatures during the study period ranged from \u00c08.5 to +18.8\u00b0C, with lower temperatures possibly resulting in an excessive cold stress and a more rapid depletion of carbohydrate reserves (Todd et al., 2000) .

Yet the findings of this study are strikingly similar to descriptions and findings of those calves described in the preceding epidemiological investigation of commercial dairy farms carried out between November 2010 and July 2011. Several causes have to be discussed when trying to explain this difference between both feeding trials. In contrast to the preliminary feeding trial under hospital conditions, the present study was carried out under field conditions on a commercial dairy farm. We assume that differences due to location, management and pathogen load played a substantial role and were more consistent with conditions described in the preliminary study. Despite the fact that each calf received chestnut extract according to its individual body weight, some calves recovered from clinical disease or were only affected subclinically (showing abnormal blood parameters only), while others died or had to be euthanised. Concurrent infections (diarrhoea, pneumonia, etc.) could have influenced the development and severity of the disease caused by the treatment. It has to be mentioned that none of the experimental calves in the preliminary feeding trial suffered from diarrhoea, whereas in the present study, all experimental calves did so to some extent during the 13 days of the trial. Apart from this, temperatures during the preliminary trial (May and June, 2011) were between +0.4 and +33.9\u00b0C and therefore decreased the risk of hypothermia in newborns. The striking difference concerning the clinical outcome in the present study in comparison with the experimental calves in the preliminary feeding trial as reported by Metzner et al. (2012) may also have been due to the fact that feeding a single component (chestnut extract) or two components (chestnut extract plus glycerol monolaurate) had a stronger impact on liver function compared with feeding the complete feed supplement. We cannot rule out that the hepatotoxic effect of chestnut extract as shown in this study was attenuated by one or more components in the commercial product.
