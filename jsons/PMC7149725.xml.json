Among the habitats of the species, northern America, Africa, southeastern Europe, and western Asia can be cited. Using these plants can protect fields from wind damage. Many researchers have reported that the species might demonstrate both fastigiate and horizontal growth habits, and therefore, it has been given subspecific taxonomic ranks. As the fastigiated form has a horticultural origin dating back to early historic or prehistoric times, it is commonly accepted that only the horizontal form precedes human activity.",

Although there are many different subspecies and varieties of this species, the widely accepted varieties by ramification type are branched cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L. var. horizantalis (Mill.) Cord.) and pyramidal (Ehrami) cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L. var. pyramidalis (fastigata = stricta) (Pictures 1\nand 2\n)).",

It is one of the ordinary trees in the Mediterranean region and spreads from the Himalayas to China. All cypresses are quite decorative, especially in their early periods, and used in park and garden landscaping as protective, strip, and live fence trees. The Mediterranean cypress can reach up to 20\u201330 m in height, and its trunk is in a conical shape (Picture 3\n). The most important property distinguishing Mediterranean cypress from other species is the oil glands within long cavities on the backs of its dark green scale leaves [1].",
