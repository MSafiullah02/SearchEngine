            "text": "Individuals with inflammatory rheumatic disease require special consideration with regard to coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many of these individuals are considered at-risk for serious infections due to their immunocompromised state resulting from their underlying immune conditions and use of tar geted immune-modulating therapies such as biolo gics. 1-4 However, some disease-modifying drugs commonly used to treat rheumatic diseases, such as hydroxychloro quine, are being investigated as potential therapies for COVID-19. 5 Other commonly used therapies, such as biologics targeting interleukin (IL)-6 (eg, tocilizumab, sarilumab) and IL-1 (eg, anakinra), are being assessed in patients with COVID-19 and who have subsequently developed pathological immune responses, including cytokine storm (eg, reactive haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). 6 Whether background immunosuppressive medications put individuals with rheumatic disease at an increased or decreased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, 7 and evidence is lacking to guide treatment decisions. A general understanding of COVID-19 char acter istics in this population is urgently needed to inform management guidelines and identify high-risk individuals during the pandemic.",

Despite the recognised track-record of high-quality observational drug safety research in rheumatology within multiple national biological registries, 8 immediate data on COVID-19-specific out comes would need to be collected to address this demand. Therefore, the inter national rheumatology com munity mobilised at an unprecedented pace to create the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance. In less than 1 week, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance successfully developed online portals and case report forms to enable healthcare providers around the world to enter information on individuals with rheumatic disease who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.",

Rheumatologists reporting cases are also under extreme pressure to work outside of rheumatology and provide front-line medical care to all patients with COVID-19 and might be unable to report cases, or reporting might be delayed. Duplicate entries might occur across different providers, although our data analytics teams carefully examine and address data quality on a regular basis. Also, despite including individuals from across the world, specific adjusted analyses might not be possible due to sample size. Finally, as the whole denominator of individuals with rheumatic diseases who acquire COVID-19 is unknown, the database will be unable to provide accurate estimates of the risk of specific outcomes across the entire rheumatic disease population or in association with specific treatments. With time, existing patient registries and administrative databases will provide these data, but likely not until the current pandemic has ended, thus strengthening the current and critical role of this database.",
