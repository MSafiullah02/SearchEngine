Here we demonstrate the long-term stability of nasopharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing across three assays recently approved by the U.S. FDA under Emergency Use Authorization. This study demonstrates that nasopharyngeal swab specimens can be stored under refrigeration or even ambient conditions for 21 days without clinically impacting the results of the real-time RT-PCR testing.",

To allow for the extensive testing needs required for effective mitigation strategies, the typical regulatory CE Mark or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval processes require a more permissive approach.(1, 2) These streamlined processes may leave individual laboratories and patients at some risk as real-world performance characteristics are assessed within the actual clinical setting. Additionally, the unprecedented rise in necessary testing caused some laboratories to reach maximum testing capacity creating delayed results and the need for prolonged storage of specimens prior to testing.(3) Given the necessity for possible longer-term storage and the lack of robust preclinical data, it is critical to understand the stability of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) following collection of patient nasopharyngeal specimens.",

Overall consistency of Ct values over the study period, for all assays and storage conditions was very good with the Fusion demonstrating slightly tighter grouping over time with the coefficients of variation (CV) of only 0.59% and 1.01% for refrigeration and room temperature respectively. The slopes of the linear regression through each platform/temperature pair ranged from -0.075 (ARIES 4\u00b0C) to 0.129 (m2000 RT) indicating only minimal deviation from the horizontal for all platforms over time.

While the testing situation in the United Kingdom and United States is improving, the number of tests performed per 100,000 individuals still lags behind other developed countries such as Demark and Italy. (11) In an effort to broaden testing capabilities, the US FDA allows some manufacturers to market their assays under the less strenuous review process of Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). It has been demonstrated that for some platforms that a manufacturers' claims provided through this more liberal review pathway may significantly overestimate performance characteristics in a true clinical environment. (12) For these reasons we sought to evaluate the performance of three separate EUA platforms over a lengthy period of time. Our data supports others' findings that viral RNA may remain stable for molecular testing for some time.
