The effect of Immunomax was observed on\nthe model of RSV-induced BA exacerbation where a pronounced Th2 response was\ninitially induced in mice by sensitization with a model allergen ovalbumin. The\nbasal concept in the treatment of allergic diseases is an inversion of the\nimmune Th2 response towards Th1. This approach is especially important for BA\npatients, because abundant data has indicated a more severe course of ARVIs in\nasthmatics [9]. This is believed to be\nrelated to the dominant Th2 response that is probably associated with the\nprevalence of activated M2 M\u03c6s in the lungs of patients\n[3]. In this regard, our findings indicate\nthat treatment with Immunomax, a TLR4 agonist, affects the phenotype of pulmonary\nM\u03c6s, polarizing the immune response towards Th1, and, therefore, that it\nmay be used for the prophylaxis of RSV infection in asthmatics.\n",
