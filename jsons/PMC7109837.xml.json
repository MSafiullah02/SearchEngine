An intact ZP has been reported to act as an effective natural barrier against viruses for various species and prevents transmission of infectious agents during embryo transfer [3\u201310]. However, very small viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family (e.g., the Mengo virus, which is 27\u201328 nm in size [11\u201313], and the Coxsackie B-4 virus, which is 30 nm [14]), have been shown to traverse the ZP of murine embryos, suggesting that this may also hold true for other viruses of similar size. The micropores in the ZP may allow entrapment of small mouse viruses even after extensive washing.",

It is highly contagious in laboratory mice, being at present one of the most prevalent viruses in mouse colonies worldwide [15]. The symptoms of MHV infection in experimental studies range from subclinical manifestations in adult mice to high morbidity and mortality in neonatal or young mice, depending on virus strain, route of infection and genotype, age, and immune status of the host [16]. In a natural infection, enterotropic MHV is restricted largely to the intestine with excretion primarily in feces, while respiratory MHV is disseminated from the nasal mucosa to various target organs [17]. Transmission of MHV occurs via direct contact with infected mice and via exposure to contaminated bedding [16\u201318].",

The virus is highly contagious, but the outcome of natural infection in immunocompetent mice is essentially asymptomatic. Breeding mice become infected during the second and third months of life [20]. During acute infection, virus replication occurs in the small intestine, lymphatic organs, and liver. The virus can persist in the mesenteric lymph nodes for a long period and is transmitted primarily by urinary or fecal excretion. Contaminated food and bedding [20] also play a role because the virus is highly resistant to environmental factors and to a number of disinfectants [21, 22].",

Today, the technique of embryo transfer is the most widely used method to rederive mice that are microbiologically contaminated or to recover valuable mouse lines archived by assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) such as cryoconservation of sperm or embryos. The risk of embryo transmission of viruses is prominent due to contamination of the reproductive tract in the abdominal cavity or due to the presence of blood from viremic mice in collecting and washing drops. Viruses can be transferred from the reproductive tracts to the holding media and can contaminate the embryos. Even mice with an acute infection can be used for ARTs, and, as such, the persistence of the virus is not an issue. The International Embryo Transfer Society recommends that embryos should be washed 10 times before transfer to suitable recipients [29]. The question remains as to whether small viruses can be removed by washing when embryos become contaminated.",

NCTC-1469 and A9 cells were used for propagation of MHV-A59 and MMVp, respectively, while L929 cells were used for titration of MHV-A59 and MMVp. NCTC-1469, A9, and L929 cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco minimum essential medium supplemented with 4.5 g/L of d-glucose/l-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (L929 in 5% fetal calf serum). Propagation of virus stocks was performed in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks (NCTC-1469 in cell culture flasks from Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA; and A9 and L929 in cell culture flasks obtained from Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 37\u00b0C using 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cultures of permissive cells were infected with the appropriate virus for 1 h followed by removal of the virus suspension and replacement with 10 ml of cell culture medium.

The supernatant was passed through a Minisart filter having a pore size of 0.20 \u03bcm (Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). For titration, L929 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 20 \u00d7 103/well for MHV-A59 and 3 \u00d7 103/well for MMVp and were cultured overnight. After removal of the culture medium, 12-fold wells were infected with 100 \u03bcl of each dilution. The cytopathic effect (CPE), observed as syncytia for MHV-A59 and as detachment of cells for the MMVp infection, was determined on the second day and the sixth day of culture, respectively. The mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) for each viral stock was calculated according to the Spearman-Kaerber method [31, 32]. The MHV-A59 and MMVp stocks used in this study had titers of 109 TCID50/ml and 106 TCID50/ml, respectively, and were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used.",

Embryos were cultured in undiluted virus stocks or in 10-fold dilutions of the virus stocks in KSOM under silicone oil (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) at 37\u00b0C in a moisture-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air in an incubator.

As such, in the present study, only blastocysts were exposed to MHV. Washing blastocysts through 10 drops of media reduced the viral load to noninfectious levels or removed virus altogether, and recipients did not develop MHV antibodies even when doses as high as 109 TCID50/ml were present in the culture media. This observation confirms results obtained when in vitro-fertilized embryos produced in media containing MHV were washed 10 times before transfer to suitable recipients [30] and when seronegative mice were rederived [4, 5, 7, 46]. These reports indicate that MHV does not become tenaciously attached to the ZP, enabling removal by washing to a level that does not constitute an infectious dose for the recipient and precluding the risk of infection. The results also show that recipients seroconvert to MHV when doses of 107 TCID50/ml or higher are present in the culture media.",

Seroconversion of MHV-infected mice generally occurs between Day 7 and Day 20 after infection [17, 27, 50\u201352]. In this study, MHV antibodies were detected in some mice in the positive groups as early as Day 21 and as late as Day 42 after embryo transfer (i.e., at the time of weaning of the pups). As such, microbiological examination of the killed mother after weaning of the pups would detect the presence of MHV in recipients. However, the absence of antibodies in some recipients receiving embryos from the same culture dish implies that recipients may not necessarily become infected, despite the presence of virus in the transferred embryos. Therefore, pertinent to microbiological monitoring, each recipient rather than representative samples or cohorts should be examined. The difference in immune response by mice to the same viral dose may be due to individual differences in the outbred mice used in the present study [41].",

MMV antibodies were found in recipients by Day 42 after embryo transfer, enabling microbiological examination immediately after weaning of the pups. MMV persists in infected mice for a longer period than MHV [53]. In our experimental colony, mice were shown to excrete MMVp in the feces for at least 1 yr after infection (unpublished results), posing a high risk of transmission to other mice, a condition that warrants appropriate measures to prevent infection of neighboring mice. Because the ODs dwindled with time and the pups became seronegative, we conclude that the MMV antibodies found in the pups were of maternal origin.",

Nevertheless, the data show that MMVp at high concentrations was not removed by 10 washes. This may also hold true for other murine viruses that are of similar size to MMV such as MPV (20\u201326 nm), Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (28\u201330 nm), and lactic dehydrogenase virus (30\u201355 nm). A lack of MMV detection by immunofluorescent assay using rat embryo fibroblast cells [23] after 2-h exposure of intact 2-cell embryos to MMV is in contradiction to the present findings. This discrepancy may be due to the coincubation of MMV-inoculated embryos with MMV antibody for 30 min [23], which may have neutralized viruses present. In our study, washing was performed with medium lacking MMV antibody. Further research is needed to optimize removal of viruses such as MMV from mouse embryos before embryo transfer.",

Viruses such as bovine herpesvirus (BHV-1) (180\u2013200 nm) and pseudorabies virus (150\u2013250 nm) adhered to the ZP even after 10 washings [29]. BVDV, having a size of 35\u201360 nm [60\u201362], and BHV-1 [63] remained attached to bovine embryos, despite washing. In contrast to a previous report of transzonal infection of the porcine ZP-intact embryo by porcine parvovirus [64], most porcine viruses adhere to but do not penetrate the ZP [40, 65] and can lead to seroconversion in recipients [66]. Sendai virus adhered to the murine ZP even after 12 washings with trypsin [58]. In the present study, whether MMV was in or within the ZP was not investigated in detail. However, serological and PCR data showed that embryos served as vectors for MMVp, suggesting that penetration of the ZP by MMVp should not be excluded. This could be the reason why, in some cases, MMVp was no longer detected in the washing drops but led to seroconversion of recipients. Another plausible reason is that MMV may get deeply lodged in the micropores of the ZP and cannot be removed even by frequent washings. Further studies are underway to determine if MMVp was in the ZP or if this virus had penetrated the ZP.",
