The 2-year progression-free and overall survival rate was 80.5% and 80.1%, respectively. Toxicities included nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, and febrile neutropenia. Treatmentrelated mortality was 8.3% in the first 100 days after transplantation. These data support the use of consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma. Background: High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been investigated in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with CNS involvement and has shown promising results. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 48 consecutive patients who had undergone HDC/ASCT with TBC (thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide) conditioning for PCNSL (27 patients), secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) (8 patients), or relapsed disease with CNS involvement (13 patients) from July 2006 to December 2017. Of the 27 patients with PCNSL, 21 had undergone ASCT at first complete remission (CR1). Results: The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 80.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.9-92.9) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-92.7%) among all patients. The 2-year PFS and OS rate for patients with PCNSL in CR1 was 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%), respectively. On univariate analysis of the patients with PCNSL, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable statistically significant for outcome (P \u00bc .007 for PFS; P \u00bc .008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL or CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI, 59.5%-96.8%) and 75.3% (95% CI, 58.6%-98.6%), respectively. The most common side effects were febrile neutropenia (89.6%; of which 66.7% had an infectious etiology identified), nausea/vomiting (85.4%), diarrhea (93.8%), mucositis (89.6%), and electrolyte abnormalities (89.6%).

Other studies have reported less impressive results, with a noted EFS rate of 46% AE 26% and OS rate of 41% AE 28% at 5 years for 13 patients with SCNSL who had undergone HDC/ ASCT with carmustine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide conditioning 39 and a disease-free survival rate of 23% AE 19% at 2 years for 24 patients with SCNSL who had undergone HDC/ASCT with TBC conditioning. 40 However, both of these studies had included patients with active CNS disease, which is known to result in poorer outcomes than those for patients with CNS lymphoma in remission. 38, 41 All the patients with SCNSL/CNS relapse in our study and in the study by Chen et al 15 and Qualls et al 36 had undergone transplantation while in CR, which likely contributed to the favorable survival outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 253, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 742, "end": 745, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 746, "end": 748, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1158, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2201, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2339, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2521, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2522, "end": 2524, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2611, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2631, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "One concern with the TBC regimen is nonhematologic toxicity. The most common therapy-related toxicities noted in most studies using this regimen have been febrile neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea. 14, 15, 18 Our study also found a high rate of nausea/vomiting and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of septic complications with TBC conditioning appears to be greater than that with other conditioning regimens and has also led to higher rates of treatment-related mortality. In our study, the TRM rate was 8.3% (all from septic complications), and other institutions have reported a range of 0% to 14.3% with TBC conditioning in patients with PCNSL. 8, 15, 18, 42 The reason for this increased toxicity is not clear. Although some studies have found age > 60 years to be a factor, 8 others have found no such association. 18 Scordo et al 18 hypothesized that the high TRM rate might be secondary to busulfan if the levels are greater than the therapeutic range. However, they found that patients with elevated first-dose busulfan area under the curve values did not experience more toxicity. 18 Given that CNS penetration of cyclophosphamide is much lower (< 30%) than what can be achieved with thiotepa and busulfan, 32 the additional benefit is unclear and might instead contribute to increased toxicity. Four patients (8.3%) developed hemorrhagic cystitis in our study. One study by Montemurro et al, 11 in 2006, examined thiotepa and busulfan without cyclophosphamide for conditioning as postremission consolidation for 16 patients. The estimated 2-year EFS was 45%, 11 and a long-term follow-up study showed an OS rate of 35%. 12 They reported a greater relapse rate (4 patients; 25%) than that reported by other studies with TBC conditioning 14, 15 and also a high TRM (2 patients; 12.5%). 11 Neurotoxicity occurred in 88.9% of the patients who had undergone WBRT, although no such cases were reported for patients who had undergone ASCT without previous WBRT. Therefore, the data thus far show no superior outcomes with the removal of cyclophosphamide from the TBC conditioning regimen. However, given that only 1 study has examined thiotepa and busulfan alone and it had a small sample size of only 16 patients, the true benefit of cyclophosphamide remains undetermined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 204, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 205, "end": 208, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 209, "end": 211, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 660, "end": 662, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 663, "end": 666, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 667, "end": 670, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 671, "end": 673, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 791, "end": 792, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 832, "end": 834, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 848, "end": 850, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1104, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1413, "text": "Montemurro et al,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1416, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1583, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1644, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1761, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1764, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1808, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An alternative option for a CNS-directed conditioning regimen is the combination of carmustine and thiotepa. Carmustine is another agent with substantial CNS penetration (15%-70%), although not as high as busulfan. 32 Two studies by Illerhaus et al 7,21 evaluated this conditioning regimen with favorable results. One study reported a PFS and an OS rate of 83% at 5 years, 21, 22 and the second study reported a projected PFS rate of 73% and OS rate of 82% at 5 years. 7, 24 Both studies reported no TRM, making this regimen another promising treatment option. As discussed in further detail in subsequent paragraphs, the conditioning regimen of carmustine and thiotepa was also evaluated in the randomized study, IELSG32 (International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group-32), which reported a 2-year OS of 77% and a TRM of 3%. 43 A meta-analysis of HDC/ASCT for PCNSL found carmustine/thiotepa to be the conditioning regimen with the lowest risk of TRM. 44 However, the TBC regimen had numerically superior PFS and OS rates. 44 Neurotoxicity appears to be less common with HDC/ASCT than with WBRT consolidation. We found a rate of 27.1% for reversible neurotoxicity, which most commonly consisted of delirium and, rarely, seizure (4.2%). Scordo et al 18 reported a similar finding of neurotoxicity in 10% of patients (including delirium, seizure, anxiety/depression, neuropathy, syncope, headache, and mania) who had undergone HDC/ASCT. Long-term neurotoxic effects were not evaluated in our study, although other reports have documented some delayed effects. 15, 17 However, the rates of long-term neurotoxic effects appear to be lower than those with WBRT, which has been reported as a 5-year cumulative incidence of neurotoxicity of 24%. 3, 4, 45, 46 Our study had several limitations, including the limited sample size and its retrospective nature. Although we did not have precise data on the number of patients who had not received HDC/ASCT, the vast majority of patients with these diagnoses in whom we initiated therapy did ultimately undergo ASCT. In our experience, it was rare for patients with these diagnoses to not be candidates for ASCT after receiving induction or salvage therapy once they had achieved a best response. Additionally, although patients with PCNSL who underwent ASCT in CR1 received a uniform induction regimen, the patients with refractory or relapsed PCNSL and SCNSL/CNS received heterogeneous induction and salvage therapies (Table 1) , making definitive conclusions on the efficacy of HDC/ASCT in this cohort of patients difficult. Finally, toxicity evaluation was not performed using the Common Terminology for Adverse Events or objective scoring systems, and toxicity was arbitrarily defined using medical record review.
