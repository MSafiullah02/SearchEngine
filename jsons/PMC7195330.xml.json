The first epidemic occurred during 2002\u20132003 in Guangdong province, China. The disease was termed \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2019 (SARS) and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus that was named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lin et al., 2006). SARS-CoV infected 8000 individuals from several countries and resulted in 774 deaths. The second epidemic occurred in 2012 in the Middle East. This disease was termed \u2018Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2019 and was caused by a new virus called MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV infected 2494 individuals and resulted in around 860 deaths (Munster et al., 2020). At the end of 2019, a third epidemic occurred. This was caused by another new type of coronavirus designated by the World Health Organization as SARS-CoV-2. The resultant disease was named \u2018coronavirus disease\u2019 (COVID-19); the disease is now a worldwide pandemic (Gorbalenya, 2020).",

An ecological study conducted in China found that air pollution was associated with lethality in individuals affected by SARS. This was attributed to the fact that short- or long-term exposure to certain pollutants can compromise lung function (Cui et al., 2003). Another environmental factor was air temperature. Lin et al. (2006) identified, for the first time, that the incidence of SARS was 18 times higher at lower air temperatures than at higher temperatures. The authors reported that respiratory system diseases are more common in colder environments and that the virulence of agents deteriorates at higher climatic temperatures, as they may not be able to withstand the environmental changes. In addition, they pointed out that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV, in terms of climatic fluctuations, is similar to that of the influenza virus. Furthermore, the incidence of influenza increases significantly with low temperatures and high relative humidity (Park, 2020), indicating that climatic factors can significantly affect viral transmission.",

(2020) identified that the speed of transmission was positively correlated with temperature and correlated with humidity. Thus, it is expected that if the temperature rises to 20 \u00b0C, transmission rates increase by an average of 1.8 days. Regarding temperature and mortality rate, a study conducted in four Chinese cities found that colder temperatures had a greater effect on mortality (Bao et al., 2016). This is in contrast to the results of the study by Li et al. (2019), which showed that both cold and heat can adversely impact the mortality resulting from respiratory syndromes.",
