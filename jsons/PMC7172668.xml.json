            "text": "The anti-rotavirus effects of some commercially available antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, interferon, dipyridamole, cimentidine, and famodine have been examined in vitro and in animal experiments (Gu et al., 2000) and have shown anti-rotavirus activities (Lecce et al., 1990, Smee et al., 1982, Tonew et al., 1977). Dipyridamole has also been reported to possess antiviral activity against representatives of other virus families (e.g., Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, and Poxviridae) (Lecce et al., 1990, Smee et al., 1982, Tonew et al., 1977). Cimentidine and famodine do not only have anti-HIV activity, but also exhibit therapeutic effects against herpes simplex virus infection (Bourinbaiar and Fruhstorfer, 1996, Kabuta et al., 1989). Although these drugs act by inhibiting rotavirus replication and adsorption, any side-effects have not been examined in clinical studies. Immunoglobulins have also been used to treat diarrhea caused by rotaviruses; however, these drugs are very costly and the side-effects are unknown (Guarino et al., 1994, Madkour et al., 1993, Yolken et al., 1985). Antiviral agents from natural sources such as black tea, Citrus aurantium, marine sponges, soy, and Stevia rebaudiana were considered as ideal drug candidates because they are less toxic, have fewer side-effects, and cheaper, but may have more effective reaction than those commercially available anti-rotavirus agents (Andres et al., 2009, Bae et al., 2000, Clark et al., 1998, Da Silva et al., 2006, Takahashi et al., 2001). However, these drugs are not currently available for human or animal use. Nevertheless, the diarrhea caused by rotaviruses remains uncontrolled, thus new drugs are urgently needed to control rotavirus infection.",

It has been reported to contain a variety of diarylheptanoids, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenoid, flavonoids, and chalcones as major constituents (Kuroyanagi et al., 1983, Ngo and Brow, 1998, Yang et al., 1999). The extracts and compounds isolated from this plant have shown anti-emetic activity and a plasma cholesterol-lowering effect by cholesterol esterase inhibitory activity, and anti-oxidant activity (Kim et al., 2000, Lee et al., 2003, Yang et al., 1999). Recently, compounds isolated from this plant showed in vitro neuraminidase inhibitory activities against human influenza virus A/PR/8/34 of subtype H1N1 and four H1N1 swine influenza viruses with antiviral effects in plaque reduction assays (Grienke et al., 2010). However, to date the anti-rotavirus activities of the extracts and compounds isolated from this plant have not been previously evaluated. Therefore, in this study, we have found the in vitro anti-rotaviral activity of AK extracts and its mechanism of anti-rotaviral activity.",

The combined ethanol extract was dissolved in 2.0 L of a mixture of water and ethanol (1:9) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and water, yielding a layer of EtOAc (192 g, AK-2) and a layer of water (70 g, AK-3). The water soluble fraction AK-3 was subjected to dianion (HP-20) column chromatography, eluted with MeOH in water in a step-gradient manner from 20% to 100% to make five fractions [20% methanol (AK-4): 3.9 g, 40% methanol (AK-5): 11.9 g, 60% methanol (AK-6): 32.7 g, 80% methanol (AK-7): 3.8 g, and 100% methanol (AK-8): 1.1 g]. In order to obtain the polysaccharide fraction, we performed another procedure. The dried and pulverized seeds of A. katsumadaii (600 g) were mixed with 1.5 L of water and shaken at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h. The water extract (98 g, AK-9) was filtered through filter paper to remove debris, and the solution was precipitated by the addition of ethanol with a 1:4 ratio (v/v) at room temperature. After overnight precipitation, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 30 min at 4 \u00b0C) and washed with acetone and freeze-dried. This fractionation procedure was repeated three times. The corresponding fraction (56 g, AK-10) was light a brown powder (polysaccharide fraction), and the remaining supernatant was concentrated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, yielding a supernatant fraction (28 g, AK-11).",

VP4 is responsible for the hemagglutination (HA) activity and the binding SA which could be different according to rotavirus strains (Isa et al., 2006, Lopez and Arias, 2006). The HA activity of some rotavirus strains lead to the idea that SA is involved in the cell binding and infectivity of some animal rotavirus as in the case of influenza A virus, reovirus type 3, various coronaviruses, and Sendai virus (Isa et al., 2006). Therefore, hemagglutination inhibition assay was employed to assess the inhibitory effects of AK extracts on viral adsorption to host cells. As a result, the six AK extracts completely inhibited viral adsorption onto hRBCs in both G8P[7] and G5P[7] rotaviruses below 11 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 2). Particularly, AK-1, AK-3, and AK-5 showed strong inhibition of hemagglutination with EC50 values of 0.7\u20134.3 \u03bcg/mL in both rotaviruses.
