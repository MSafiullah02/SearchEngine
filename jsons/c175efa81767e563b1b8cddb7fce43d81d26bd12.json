Most of the affected peoples had reached India from different part of the world, as like of carrier. Owing to this, India made several precautionary measures to mitigate/neglect the disease in beginning stage, however, the denser population of country will not be simple to control the same for long time (community spread), if government will not incorporate the visionary strategies. Since attacked several nations have been worried mostly for their people life (health), despite that developing country like India with huge population should consider about the livelihood (for Below Poverty Line (BPL) people), equally with the life. This article will give insights to make effective strategy to culminate the world threat COVID-19 in India.",

An overall good sign has been mortality rate (4.33%) which was lesser than the other pandemic diseases, and almost one third of the affected peoples were recovered (till March 23, 2020). 7 Though fatality ratio was statistically less, the affected patients are increasing in the rate of multiplication; not by an addition. Thus, world governments should make consensus to eradicate the COVID-19 as much earlier, which will be helpful to save the poor population in all over the globe.",
