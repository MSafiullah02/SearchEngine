Endoscopy departments are fertile grounds for viral spread because aerosolisation of bodily secretions occurs during procedures. A single viral-shedding patient with a high viral load can contaminate an entire endoscopy room with the virus that remains viable for up to 3 days, putting uninfected patients and HCWs at risk.2 3\n",

However, the median incubation time of the virus is 5.1 days but can extend to 14 days (99th percentile), meanwhile patients remain asymptomatic or have subclinical symptoms and may be infectious.5 6 This limits screening protocols reliant on symptomatology. GI symptoms of COVID-19 are also non-specific. Travel history becomes limited when COVID-19 becomes more rampant in local communities so contact screening for exposure to individuals who have symptoms of COVID-19 may be more useful. Nonetheless, data on the accuracy of question-based screening tools were not identified.",

US and UK guidelines regarded lower endoscopy as low risk and therefore were less stringent with PPEs compared with China or Singapore (table 2).
