Most of these are benign, and some, such as the normal gut flora, play an important part in promoting health via the synthesis of vitamins and stimulation of normal function of gut epithelia. Approximately 0.1% of microbes in our environment have catastrophic effects if they penetrate the epithelial surfaces of the body (Bryson, 2003) . History reveals many instances in which armies have been defeated and civilizations have collapsed because of encounters between humans and such microorganisms (Diamond, 1999) .",

            "text": "Humans, like all mammals, have evolved with a complex immune system, which is present as specialized organs (spleen, thymus) or cell types (lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells) throughout the body. The system can detect and destroy any cell or particle that is not\"self,\" i.e., a normal component of the body. A complex series of events follows from contact between components of the immune system and microbes invading the body ( Fig. 1) . The response can be divided into two main categories. The first is the acquired immune response, in which the immune system recognizes specific chemical motifs on the invader and \"remembers\" the encounter so that a more rapid, specific, and intense response can be produced at any future meeting. The second category is the nonspeciflc response in which the response to each encounter is similar for all invaders of the body. The process of inflammation is a central part of the second category of response. The immune response is also activated by a wide range of adverse events, such as surgery, bums, and trauma. The primary purposes of the response are to kill pathogens and initiate the curative processes that will restore body function to normal. The first purpose is achieved by creating a hostile tissue environment through production of oxidant molecules and activation of T and B lymphocytes. Part of the response ensures a supply of substrate, from endogenous sources, for supporting the activity of T and B lymphocytes and enhancement of antioxidant defenses. The latter event is important for protecting healthy tissue from the oxidants produced as part of the inflammatory response (Grimble, 2001 a) . The response exerts considerable biological demands and stress on the body. A central part of substrate provision is the release of amino acids into the blood from the breakdown of proteins in skeletal muscle, skin, and bone matrix, and fatty acids released from triglycerides stored in adipose tissue. Enhanced gluconeogenesis, catabolic hormone production, and decreased insulin sensitivity occurs to facilitate this redistribution of tissue Infective or cellular Fig. 2 .

The animal loses the desire to carry out many day-to-day activities. Physical weakness ensues, exploratory activity declines, appetite is decreased, and apathy and sleep may occur. The response thus exerts physiological and mental stress upon the body.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-113, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-t~, are major activators and modulators of the events described above. To modulate the degree of stress imposed on the body, in achieving the essential functions of inflammation, the response comes under the control of powerful anti-inflammatory mechanisms. These will impose their biological effects with increasing vigor as the original stimulus for the inflammatory response (infection, injury) declines in intensity. Heat-shock proteins, endorphins, glucocorticoid hormones, and cytokine receptor antagonists are important components of this anti-inflammatory system.This system is essential for closing down the inflammatory response once it has achieved its primary purposes because of the high biological cost it imposes on the body (Grimble, 2001 a) .",

Many studies have shown that excessive or prolonged production of cytokines is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions (Fig. 2) . These include sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, malaria, meningitis, cancer, cystic fibrosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. Events similar to those seen in the inflammatory response to injury and infection can be observed during the course of overt inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease and in diseases that have a covert inflammatory basis, for example, atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus (Fig. 3) . Clearly the inflammatory response in these situations does not have a purposeful nature and contribute to the disease process. Recent studies indicate that low-intensity inflammation occurs in elderly and obese individuals (Grimble 2002 (Grimble , 2003 . Thus, the inflammatory response, which has evolved to allow humankind to survive infection and injury, is indiscriminate in both its triggers and targets. As a result, the process is a two-edged sword capable of both defending and damaging its bearer.",

However, research in the last 5 yr has shown that the balance in production between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines has a more direct bearing on the outcome of infection and injury. For example, in sepsis, plasma IL-6 concentrations were higher and IL-10 concentrations were lower in patients who died than in those who survived (Arnalich et al., 2000; Taniguchi et al., 1999) . A survey of over 400 patients admitted to hospital in the Netherlands with fever showed that, independently of how the patients were clinically classified (positive blood cultures, presence of endotoxin), those who subsequently died had a higher plasma IL-10:TNF-o~ ratio than patients who survived (Van Dissell, van Langervelde, Westendorp, Kwappenberg, & Frolich, 1998) .",

The families are nuclear transcription factor K B (NF-rd3) and activator protein 1 (AP1). These transcription factors act as \"control switches\" for biological processes, not all of which are of advantage to the individual. NF-rd3 is present in the cytosol in an inactive form, by virtue of being bound to an inhibitory unit I-r,B. Phosphorylation and dissociation of I-r,B renders the remaining NF-~cB dimer active. The dissociated I-rd3 is degraded, and the active NF-r,B is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to response elements in the promoter regions of genes. A similar translocation of AP1, a transcription factor composed of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-jun, from cytosol to nucleus, also occurs in the presence of oxidant stress. Binding of the transcription factors is implicated in activation of a wide range of genes associated with inflammation and the immune response, including those encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, cell adhesion molecules, acute-phase proteins, and growth factors (Schreck, Rieber, & Baeurerle, 1991) (Fig. 4 ) . Activation of NF-rd3 can be brought about by a wide range of stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines, hydrogen peroxide, mitogens, bacteria and viruses and their related products, and ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiations. The extent of activation of NF-rd3 will depend in part upon the strength and efficiency of the antioxidant defenses of the body. These comprise endogenous components such as glutathione (GSH) and enzymatic components of antioxidant defenses, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and GSH peroxidase, and dietary components that have antioxidant properties (e.g., vitamins C and E and polyphenolic compounds). The influence of modulation of inflammation by these dietary factors are dealt with later.",

This sequence of events, in the case of HIV, accounts for the ability of minor infections to speed the progression of individuals who are infected with HIV towards acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Thus, if antioxidant defenses are poor, each encounter with general infections results in cytokine and oxidant production, NF-~zB activation, and an increase in HIV replication. It is thus unfortunate that reduced cellular concentrations of GSH are a common feature of infections, including that from the HIV (Staal, Ela, & Roederer, 1992) .

A large body of research has indicated that SNPs occur in the upstream regulatory (promoter) regions of many cytokine genes (Bidwell et al., 2001) . Many of these genetic variations influence the level of expression of genes and the outcome from the inflammatory response. Both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines are influenced by the differences in genotype (Allen 1999; Turner, Williams, & Sankeran, 1997) . A number of SNPs that have been implicated in the outcome of inflammatory stress are shown in Table 1 .",

There are four variations in the NRAMP1 gene, resulting in different basal levels of activity and differential sensitivity to stimulation by inflammatory agents. Alleles 1, 2, and 4 are poor promoters, whereas allele 3 causes high gene expression. Hyperactivity of macrophages, associated with allele 3, is linked to autoimmune disease susceptibility and high resistance to infection, whereas allele 2 increases susceptibility to infection and protects against autoimmune disease (Searle & Blackwell, 1999) .",

In a study of inflammatory lung disease caused by exposure to coal dust, the TNF2 (LT-a+252 A) allele was almost twice as common in miners with the disease than in those who were healthy (Zhai, Jetten, Schins, Franssen, & Borm, 1998) . Development of farmer's lung from exposure to hay dust was 80% greater in individuals with the TNF2 allele than in those without the allele (Schaaf, Seitzer, Pravica, Aries, & Zabel, 2001) . The TNF2 allele was also twice as common in smokers who developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than in those who remained disease-free (Sakao et al., 2001) . In addition to disease progression, genetic factors have important effects on mortality and morbidity in infectious and inflammatory disease. During malaria, children who were homozygous for TNF2 had a sevenfold greater risk of death or serious pathology than children who were homozygous for the TNF1 allele (McGuire, Hill, Allsopp, Greenwood, & Kwiatkowski, 1994) . In intensive-care patients the occurrence of 1082\"G high-producing allele for IL-10 was present in those who developed multiorgan failure with a frequency of one-fifth of that of the normal population (Reid, Hutchinson, Campbell, & Little, 1999) . In sepsis, patients possessing the TNF2 allele had a 3.7-fold greater risk of death than those without the allele, and patients who were homozygous for the LT-~ + 252 A allele had twice the mortality rate and higher peak plasma TNF-ot concentrations than heterozygotic individuals (Mira et al., 1999; Stuber, Peterson, Bokelmann, & Schade, 1996) . The TNF2 allele also been found in increased frequencies in systemic lupus erythromatosus, dermatitis hepetiformis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (Jacob et al., 1990 , Wilson, Clay, & Crane, 1995 Wilson, Gordon, & di Giovine, 1994) .",

            "text": "Thus, it now appears that each individual possesses combinations of SNPs in their genes associated with inflammation corresponding to inflammatory drives of differing intensities when microbes or tissue injury are encountered. At an individual level this may express itself as differing degrees of morbidity and mortality (Fig. 5) . The strength of the genomic influence on the inflammatory process may affect the chances of an individual developing inflammatory disease, particularly if their antioxidant defenses are poor. In addition to disease progression, genetic factors have important effects on mortality and morbidity in infectious and inflammatory disease and following injury (Paolini-Giacobino, Grimble, & Pichard, 2003) . There are sex-linked differences in the influence of genotype on the inflammatory processes. In general, males are more sensitive to the genomic influences on the strength of the inflammatory process than females. In a study on LT-a genotype and mortality from sepsis, it was found that men possessing a TNFB22 (LT-o~+ 252 AA) genotype had a mortality of 72% compared with men who were TNFB 11 (LT-o~+ 252 GG), who had a 42% mortality rate. In female patients the mortalities for the two genotypes were 53% and 33%, respectively (Schroder, Kahlke, Book, & Stuber, 2000) . In a study on patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer, it was found that postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 concentrations were higher in men than in women. Multivariate analysis showed that males possessing the TNF2 (TNF-o~-308 A) allele had greater responses than men without it. The genomic influence was not seen in females (Table 2) (Grimble, Thorell, et al., 2003) . Furthermore, possession of the IL-1-511 T allele was associated with a 48% greater length of stay in hospital in old men admitted for geriatric care (Table 3) (Grimble, Anderson, et al., 2003) . Women were unaffected by these genetic influences.",

Periodontal disease and other low-grade infections, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, have been linked closely with atherosclerosis. Development of atherosclerotic plaques to which macrophages have already been recruited occurs by cytokines inducing hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (Kol, Sukhova, Lichtman, & Libby, 1998; Saldeen & Rand 1998) . Chlamydial infection induces production of TNF-~. The cytokine inhibits the action of lipoprotein lipase, leading to changed lipid metabolism, elevation of serum triglycerides, and a decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, thereby exerting an atherogenic influence (Arrnitage, 2000) . In the Bruneck study, raised plasma bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was associated with an increased rate of thickening of the coronary artery intima. Smoking, a further inflammatory stress, exacerbated this effect (Williet & Kiechl, 2000) . LPS binds in human serum to both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL cholesterol and makes LDL cholesterol immunogenic or toxic to endothelial cells. Thus, the link between specific infections and atherosclerosis may be a nonspecific effect of chronic inflammation on the atherosclerotic process.",

Proteins that increase during inflammation (positive acute-phase proteins, e.g., CRP and fibrinogen) and those that decrease (negative acute-phase proteins, e.g., serum albumin and retinolbinding protein) are used to diagnose inflammation in population nutritional surveys. The early indications that inflammation was involved in atherosclerosis came from the findings that there were links between concentrations of positive and negative acute-phase proteins in blood and CVD (Grimble, 1990 ). In the Bruneck study of a group of 826 40to 79-yr-old Italians, it was found that impaired glucose tolerance and, to a greater extent, type 2 diabetes were strong independent predictors of advanced atherosclerosis (measured by high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid artery) (Bonora, Kiechl, & Oberhollenzer, 2000) . A cross-sectional study of obesity, plasma CRP, fibrinogen, and carotid artery intima media thickness (an index of atherosclerosis) in more than 1500 multiethnic subjects showed a positive relationship between plasma CRP and body fat. Intima media thickness was related to CRP and fibrinogen in men. The relationship was attenuated by adjustment for BMI (Festa, D'Agostino, & Williams, 2001) . A cross-sectional study of more than 1800 men and women examined the link between elevated plasma CRP concentrations and prevalent CVD, ankle/brachial blood pressure, and carotid artery intima media thickness. After adjustment for age and family type, there was a weak association between CRP and intima media thickness in both sexes and with prevalent heart disease in women (Folsom, Pankow, & Tracy, 2001) . A study on a Turkish population of 1046 individuals with low cholesterol concentration but a high prevalence of other risk factors for coronary heart disease investigated whether CRP acted as a predictor of coronary heart disease. Among the risk factors, only CRP and systolic blood pressure were independent risk factors for CVD (Onat, Sansoy, & Yildirim, 2001) . In a study in which CRP concentrations and conventional risk factors for CVD in 500 healthy Indian Asians were compared with values in a similar number of healthy European white subjects, CRP and CVD risk factors were higher in the former group. However, differences were eliminated when adjustment was made for central obesity and insulin resistance score (Chambers, Eda, & Bassett, 2001) . A study on a Brazilian population found that markers of inflammation correlated with components of the metabolic syndrome---cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors, insulin resistance, and central obesity (Duncan & Schmidt, 2001) . In a study of 574 healthy elderly subjects in the Netherlands, acute-phase proteins, soluble adhesion molecules, IL-6, and insulin were measured and associated with cholesterol and obesity. The association between insulin, obesity, and cholesterol was as strong as between insulin, acute-phase proteins, and adhesion molecules (Hak, Pols, & Stehouwer, 2001) .",

The relative risk of future type 2 diabetes in women between the highest and lowest quartiles of these inflammatory markers was 7.5 for IL-6 and 15.7 for CRP (Pradhan, Manson, & Rifai, 2001) These data suggest a possible role for inflammation in diabetogenesis. Furthermore, data collected from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in the United States provide further evidence for a possible role of inflammation in insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. More than 2500 men and women were studied for associations between plasma CRP, fasting insulin, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c). Elevated CRP was associated with higher insulin and HbA 1 c in both sexes and with raised glucose in women (Wu, Dorn, & Donahue, 2002) .

Blood TNF-t~ concentrations and glycosylated hemoglobin decreased (Iwamoto, Nishimura, & Nakagawa, 2001) . Conversely, improvement in insulin sensitivity exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. A group of 18 hyperlipidemic patients and 20 normolipidemic controls who were insulin resistant and hypertriglyceridemic with low HDL cholesterol concentrations and raised TNF-o~ production and plasma IL-6 and fibrinogen concentrations were studied.

Many studies suggest that the former is more likely to be the case. Reviews have highlighted the risk of inflammation and infection of atherosclerotic plaques associated with poor diabetic control and the importance of elevated nonesterified fatty acid concentrations, glucocorticoids, and low-grade inflammation as causative agents in atherosclerosis and insulin insensitivity (Bell, 2000; Corry & Tuck, 2001) . A study on type 2 diabetes mellitus patients determined the extent to which PBMCs contributed to oxidative stress and inflammation. A linear correlation between HbAlc and superoxide release was found. The authors concluded that type 2 diabetes mellitus is accompanied by priming of PBMCs and increased self-necrosis. The necrosis may start a chain of events that results ultimately in oxidant stress and endothelial dysfunction (Shurtz-Swirski, Sela, & Herskovitis, 2001) . In a study on Pima Indians, who are characterized by high incidence of obesity and insulin resistance but not atherosclerotic disease, CRP, ICAM-1, and secretory phospholipase A2 are correlated with body fat but not E-selectin and von Willebrand factor. In addition to showing that markers of inflammation increase with adiposity, the study showed that markers of endothelial dysfunction increase in proportion to insulin resistance and inflammation (Weyer, Yudkin, & Stehouwer, 2002) . A further study on Pima Indians examined whether a raised white blood cell count predicted a worsening of insulin action, insulin secretory function, and the development of type 2 diabetes. A high white blood cell count predicted the development of diabetes with a relative risk of 2.7 when adjusted for age and sex (Vozarova, Weyer, & Lindsay, 2002) .",

Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to account for these metabolic effects of TNF-ot. These include the downregulation of genes that are required for normal insulin action, direct effects on insulin signaling, induction of elevated plasma free fatty acids via stimulation of lipolysis, and negative regulation of PPAR-7, an important insulin-sensitizing nuclear receptor (Moiler, 2000) . The induction of insulin resistance is mediated through its ability to produce serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, decreasing the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (Hotamisligil, Budavari, Murray, & Spiegelman, 1994) . Neutralization of TNF-t~ in obese fa/fa rats by intravenous administration of a soluble TNF receptor immunoglobulin G chimeric protein substantially improved insulin sensitivity and restored the tyrosine kinase activity in fat and muscle (Hotamisligil et al., 1996) . In an in vitro study using 3T3-L 1 adipocytes, TNF-t~ was shown to induce sustained suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 3 (SOCS-3) production. SOCS-3 has been shown to decrease insulin-induced IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (Emanuelli, Peraldi, & Filloux, 2001) . These observations therefore suggest that SOCS-3 may be a key mediator in the development of insulin sensitivity during inflammation.",

            "text": "Obesity is associated with insulin resistance, particularly when body fat has a central distribution. While elevated plasma leptin concentrations are associated with obesity, some studies have suggested that insulin sensitivity is an additional determinant of circulating leptin concentrations. Leptin is produced by adipose tissue in proportion to adipose tissue mass and is a pleiotropic molecule. In addition to playing a role in appetite and adipose tissue regulation, leptin influences immune functions. Leptin concentrations increase acutely during inflammation and regulate T-cell responses, polarizing T-helper (Th) cells toward a Th 1 phenotype. Thus, increased leptin production during obesity, may exert a pro-inflammatory influence (Faggioni, Feingold, & Grunfeld, 2001) . Further complexity is added to the concept of a link between insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and obesity by the results of a study of 268 individuals selected from the Health Professionals follow-up study in the United States (Chu, Spiegelman, & Hotamisligil, 2001) . In the study plasma insulin, leptin, and soluble TNF receptor (sTNF-R, an index of TNF-o~ production) concentrations were measured and correlated with BMI and the CVD risk factors insulin, triglyceride, t-PA antigen levels, and apolipoprotein (Apo)-A1. In a multivariate regression model controlling for age, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and diet, BMI was inversely associated with HDL cholesterol and Apo-A1 and positively associated with trigyceride, Apo-B, and t-PA antigen levels. The associations between BMI and these CVD risk factors were only slightly changed after adjusting for leptin and/or sTNF-R, but were substantially attenuated after controlling for insulin levels. These data suggest that the association between obesity and biological predictors of CVD may be mediated through changes in plasma insulin, rather than leptin or sTNF-R levels, and that insulin may be exerting an anti-inflammatory effect.

NF-~:B is an important mediator of inflammation by increasing transcription of a range of genes central to the inflammatory process (cytokines, adhesion molecules, acute-phase proteins). SNPs in the NF-r,~B gene were investigated in a group of 217 type 1 diabetic patients and compared with gene frequencies in 111 normal controls. It was found that there was a higher frequency of allele 138 bp (A10) (high bioactivity) and a lower frequency of allele 146 bp (A14) (less bioactive) in diabetics than in controls. Genotype may thus contribute to inflammatory stress in diabetes mellitus (Hegazy, O'Reilly, & Yang, 2001) . NF-~:B may also provide an important focus for PPAR-7 action, because it has been shown in a number of studies that PPAR-~/in combination with retinoid X receptor is able to inhibit NF-~:B activation (Wada, Nakajima, & Blumberg, 2001; Fruchart, Staels, & Durlez, 2001; Debril, Renaud, Fajas, & Auwerx, 2001) . It is interesting to note that the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), found in abundance in fish oil, are PPAR-y agonists, raising the possibility that the oil may exert its anti-inflammatory effects partly via this mechanism.",

Insight into this issue can be gained from the response to surgery where an inflammatory stimulus is applied at a defined moment in time, making it easy to follow the subsequent response. Ono, Aosasa, Tsujimoto, Ueno, and Mochizuki (2001) investigated the agerelated changes in the inflammatory response in patients with gastric cancer undergoing distal gastrectomy. Patients were divided into two groups: >75 yr of age (elderly group) and -<75 years of age (young group). Serum IL-6 concentrations, TNF-ct production and CD 11 b/CD 18 expression by monocytes, and the postoperative clinical course were compared between the two groups to assess the inflammatory response to surgery. TNF-~ production by LPS-stimulated monocytes and CD 1 l b/CD 18 expression on monocytes were significantly higher in the elderly than in the young group. Moreover, serum IL-6 concentrations on the first postoperative day in the elderly group were significantly higher than those in the young group.",

It is an important contributor to the development of frailty and functional impairment during aging. It is well established that aging is associated with a significant decline in muscle strength that becomes functionally important by the seventh decade of life. The relationship between chronic inflammation owing to disease during aging and the prevalence of low body mass are well illustrated in rheumatoid arthritis. In a study on patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the loss of body mass was greater for lean tissue than fat, with over 50% of the rheumatoid group falling into the lowest 10th percentile of a reference population for skeletal muscle mass assessed from the upper arm muscle area. In female patients there was a significant correlation between reduced fat-free mass and two indicators of inflammatory stress---erythrocyte sedimentation rate and plasma CRP concentration (Munro & Capell, 1997) . Clinical and animal studies show a relationship between raised plasma cytokine concentrations and low muscle mass. Visser et al. (2002) investigated whether markers of inflammation are associated with muscle mass and strength over a time course of several years in over 3000 healthy well-functioning black and white elderly persons (70-79 yr). Mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area, appendicular muscle mass, and muscle strength were assessed. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-~ were also measured. Higher cytokine concentrations were associated with lower muscle mass and lower muscle strength. The most consistent relationship across the gender and race groups was observed for IL-6 and grip strength. When an overall indicator of elevated cytokine production was created by combining the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-o~, with the exception of white men, elderly persons having high concentrations of IL-6 (> 1.80 pg/mL) as well as high levels of TNF-~ (>3.20 pg/mL) had a smaller muscle area, less appendicular muscle mass, and lower muscle strength compared to those with low levels of both cytokines. Thus, raised plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-~ are associated with lower muscle mass and lower muscle strength in well-functioning older men and women as well as those suffering frank inflammatory disease.",

Twenty subjects had a positive urine culture, and 20 sex-and age-matched subjects had a negative urine culture. Inclusion criteria were temperature <37.8\u00b0C, no clinical signs of infection, and no current antibiotic treatment. Patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria had significantly increased levels of TNF receptors and a higher number of neutrophils in the blood compared to the group without bacteriuria. Thus, the study provides some support for the hypothesis that asymptomatic urinary infections are associated with low-grade inflammatory activity in frail, elderly subjects (Prio, Bruunsgaard, Roge, & Pedersen, 2002) .",

In aging, dysregulation of secretion of hormones that come under the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may occur. This may have an effect on the regulation of cortisol secretion, as mentioned earlier. Cortisol is important as an anti-inflammatory agent. The effect of aging on glucocorticoid sensitivity of pro-inflammatory cytokine production was examined in elderly men, testosterone-treated elderly men, and young controls. Stress-induced increases in cortisol did not differ significantly between experimental groups, but glucocorticoid sensitivity increased significantly in young controls and testosterone-treated elderly men, whereas a decrease was found in untreated elderly men. As the increase in glucocorticoid sensitivity after stress serves to protect the individual from detrimental increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the disturbed mechanism in elderly men may result in an increase in inflammatory stress (Rohleder, Kudielka, Hellhammer, Wolf, & Kirschbaum, 2002) .",

However in premenopausal women production is highly variable at an individual level, indicating how ovarian hormones are able to override the influence of genotype (Jacob et al., 1990) . The exact mechanisms by which estrogen interferes with cytokine activity are still incompletely known but may include interactions of the estrogen receptor with other transcription factors, modulation of nitric oxide activity, antioxidative effects, plasma membrane actions, and changes in immune cell function. Experimental and clinical studies also strongly support a link between the increased state of pro-inflammatory cytokine activity and postmenopausal bone loss (Pfeilschifter et al., 2002) .",

Thus, although HLA studies in mice of different genotypes may be interpreted to support studies of MHC effects on longevity in humans, in mice the association may be by way of altered susceptibility to lymphomas, whereas in human beings the effect on longevity is likely to be via an altered response to pathogens and susceptibility to infectious disease. A number of cross-sectional studies have examined the role of HLA genes on human longevity by comparing HLA antigen frequencies between groups of young and elderly persons. Conflicting findings have been obtained. When this topic was reviewed (Caruso et al., 2001) , it was concluded that in humans there may be an association between longevity and some HLA-DR alleles or the HLA-BS,DR3 haplotype. These genotypes are involved in the antigen nonspecific control of immune response, in other words, the component of immune function associated with inflammation and cytokine biology.",

When 700 individuals between 60 and 110 yr of age were studied, it was noted that not only was plasma IL-6 concentration positively related to age but individuals with a SNP in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene, which predisposes to high levels of production of the cytokine (-174 GG), decreased in frequency with age. The effect was seen in men but not in women (Bonafe, Olivieri, & Cavallone, 2001) . Although men with SNPs made up 58% of the 60-to 80-yr-old age group, the percentage fell to 38% in subjects <99 years of age. Conversely, one of three SNPs in the IL-10 gene (-1082 GG), which is closely linked to higher production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Hutchinson, Pravica, Hajeer, & Sinnott, 1999; Turner et al., 1997) , was found in higher proportions in male centenarians than in younger controls (58 vs 34%). In females this genotype exerted no effect upon longevity (Lio et al., 2002) . Thus, it would appear that genetic characteristics that might influence the balance between proand anti-inflammatory cytokines influence mortality in men but not in women (Franceschi et al., 2000) . A study on SNPs that influence interferon (IFN)-~t production further reinforces the concept that possession of a genotype that predisposes to a raised pro-inflammatory status is not compatible with a long life span (Lio et al., 2002) . In women, possession of the A allele, which is associated with low production of IFN-'~, significantly increased the possibility of reaching old age. It might be concluded that possession of high-producing alleles of the IL-10 is universally protective against morbidity as well as mortality.",

Meta-analyses have been conducted on the efficacy of immunonutrients that influence antioxidant status.

However, Beale, Bryg, & Bihari (1999) , in a meta-analysis of 12 studies containing more than 1400 patients receiving enteral immunonutrition, observed that although there was no effect upon mortality, there were significant reductions in infection rates, time spent on a ventilator, and length of hospital stay.

First, patients used as the subjects of clinical trials of immunonutrients will constitute a diverse population--different ages, at different stages of a disease process, and undergoing complex clinical treatment in addition to nutrient therapy. Second, patients will have differing genetic backgrounds that will influence the intensity of the inflammatory and immune responses they are undergoing. This issue is dealt with below. Third, nutrients may exert paradoxical effects, as illustrated by the findings of the first observations of the effects of fish oil on cytokine production in healthy subjects. The findings of Endres et al. (1989) that a daily supplement of 18 g/d of fish oil given to nine young men for 6 wk was able to reduce ex vivo production oflL-1 and TNF-~ by LPS-stimulated PBMCs aroused great interest in fish oil as an anti-inflammatory nutrient. This perception was supported by a large amount of animal data. However, Endres' data showed a wide variability in the effect of the fish oil supplements. The standard deviations of the mean for IL-113 and TNF-cx production were 59 and 51%, respectively. This indicates that cytokine production could have risen or fallen as a consequence of taking the supplement.",

It was found that 51% of subjects experienced a fall in production and 49% a rise. Although the ability of fish oil to increase TNF-t~ production is at first sight paradoxical, earlier work of Dinarello, Bishai, Rosenwasser, and Coceani (1984) and Kunkel, Remick, Spengler, and Chensue (1987) indicated that fish oil could potentially change cytokine production in either direction. What mechanisms could result in this divergent effect? Inflammation will result in activation of phospholipase A2, which releases arachidonic acid (AA) (C20:4 n-6) from the cell membrane for prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2) or leukotriene B 4 (LT B4 ) synthesis. The in vitro studies (Kunkel et al., 1987) showed that PGE2 suppressed TNF-t~ production, whereas LTB4 had the opposite effect (Dinarello et al., 1984) .. Fish oil is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3), which will replace AA in the cell membrane and results in the production of PGE3 and LT B5. PGE3 and LT B5 are considerably less potent than the corresponding compounds produced from AA, and thus dietary fish oil may lessen the inhibitory influence of PGE2 or the stimulatory influence of LTB4 on TNF-o~ production, resulting in a potential increase or decrease, respectively, in production of the cytokine. Fish oil could thus result in an inflammatory cytokine response, which could fall on either side of the pivot.",

Although the inflammatory response and the T-cell response both play a part in defeating the invader, the inflammatory response may in some clinical circumstances exert an inhibitory influence on T-cell function. In severely infected or traumatized patients, an enhanced inflammatory state occurs, which is associated with immunosuppression. In vitro studies support this inverse relationship. PBMCs taken from healthy young subjects and incubated with GSH show decreased PGE2 and LTB4 production (reduced inflammation) and an increase in mitogenic index and IL-2 production (enhanced immune function) (Wu, Meydani, Sastre, Hayek, & Meydani, 1994) .",

Although all antioxidants are important owing to the linked nature of antioxidant defense (Fig. 8) , GSH plays a pivotal role as it acts directly as an antioxidant and maintains other components of defense in a reduced state through enzymic conversion between the oxidized and reduced states. Various compounds can be used to increase GSH synthesis (Fig. 9 ). N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) and the GSH prodrug oxothiazalidine-4-carboxylate (procysteine) have been used in a number of clinical studies. Tissue GSH content is also influenced by protein and sulfur amino acid intake. Unfortunately, surgery, a wide range of diseases that have an inflammatory component, and aging and protein energy malnutrition decrease GSH concentration in blood and other tissues (Boya et al., 1999; Loguercio et al., 1999; Luo, Hammarqvist, Anderson, & Wernerman, 1996; Micke, Beeh, Schlaak, & Buhl, 2001; Nuttal et al., 1999; Reid et al., 2000) (Table 5 ).

            "text": "Modification of the GSH content of liver, lung, spleen, and thymus in young rats by feeding diets containing a range of casein (a protein with a low sulfur amino acid content) concentrations changed immune cell numbers in lung (Hunter & Grimble, 1994 found that in unstressed animals the number of lung neutrophils decreased as dietary protein intake and tissue GSH content fell. However, in animals given an inflammatory challenge (endotoxin), liver and lung GSH concentrations increased directly in relation to dietary protein intake. Lung neutrophils, however, became related inversely with tissue GSH content. Addition of methionine to the protein-deficient diets normalized tissue GSH content and restored lung neutrophil numbers to those seen in unstressed animals fed a diet with adequate protein content (Fig. 10) . Why does tissue GSH content have differing effects on immune cell populations depending on whether or not an inflammatory response is occurring? A partial explanation may come from an in vitro study using HeLa cells and cells from human embryonic kidney. In the study, both TNF-o~ and hydrogen peroxide resulted in activation of NF-~cB and AP1 (Wesselborg, Bauer, Vogt, Schmitz, & Schulze-Osthoff, 1997) . Addition of the antioxidant sorbitol to the medium suppressed NF-~fl3 activation as expected, but unexpectedly activated AP 1. Thus, the antioxidant environment of the cell might exert opposite effects upon transcription factors closely associated with inflammation (e.g., NF-~fl3) and cellular proliferation (e.g., AP1). Evidence for this biphasic effect was seen when GSH was incubated with immune cells from young adults (Wu et al., 1994) . A rise in cellular GSH content was accompanied by an increase in IL-2 production and lymphocyte proliferation (enhancement of T-cell function) and a decrease in production of the inflammatory mediators PGE2 and LTB4 (anti-inflammatory influence). Without doubt, a decline in antioxidant status in the presence of oxidant stress will increase inflammatory stress. The interaction between oxidant stress and an impaired ability to synthesize GSH, a situation that stimulates inflammation, is clearly seen in cirrhosis, a disease that results in high levels of oxidative stress and an impaired ability to synthesize GSH . In Pena an inverse relationship between GSH concentration and the ability of monocytes to produce IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-t~ was observed. Treatment of cirrhotic patients with the procysteine increased monocyte GSH content and reduced IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-t~ production. Septic patients given an infusion of NAC (150 mg/kg bolus followed by infusion of 50 mg/kg over 4-h) showed a decrease in plasma IL-8 and soluble TNF receptor p55, had a reduced requirement for ventilator support, and spent 19 fewer days in intensive care than patients not receiving NAC (Spapen et al., 1998 ). De Rosa et al. (2000 showed that NAC was able to restore tissue GSH concentrations in individuals with HIV infection. In a study on HIV-positive patients, Brietkreutz et al. (2000) showed that a dose of 600 mg/d of NAC for 7 mo resulted in a decrease in plasma IL-6 (decreased inflammation), an increase in natural killer cell activity, and increased responsiveness of T lymphocytes to tetanus toxin stimulation (improved lymphocyte function).",

When rats were subjected to depletion of effective tissue GSH pools by administration of diethyl maleate, there was a significant reduction in lymphocyte proliferation in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (Robinson et al., 1993) . An increase in inflammatory stress would be expected in this study. Thus, it can be hypothesized that antioxidants exert an immunoenhancing effect by activating transcription factors that are strongly associated with cell proliferation (e.g., AP 1) and an anti-inflammatory effect by preventing activation of NF-r,B by oxidants produced during the inflammatory response (Dr&ouml; ge et al., 1994) .Thus, inclusion of antioxidants or substances that increase GSH synthesis in immunonutrient mixes would seem to be beneficial. Improvement of antioxidant defenses is also possible by feeding other components of antioxidant defenses. Supplementation of the diet of healthy subjects and smokers with 600 IU/d t~-tocopherol for 4 wk suppressed the ability of PBMCs to produce TNF-t~ (Mol, de Rijke, Demacher, & Stalenhoef, 1997) . The same dose given to healthy elderly subjects for 235 d increased delayed-type hypersensitivity and raised antibody titers to hepatitis B (Meydani et al., 1997 ). An enteral feed enriched with vitamin E, vitamin C, and taurine given to intensive-care patients decreased total lymphocyte and neutrophil content in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (decreased inflammation) and resulted in a reduction in organ failure rate, a reduced requirement for artificial ventilation, and a reduction of 5 d in intensive-care stay (Gadek et al., 1999) .",

The effects would be seen in a decrease in oxidant damage, downregulation of inflammation, and, because of the inverse link between inflammation and immune function, an improvement in T-lymphocyte function. Meydani, Meydani, & Verdon (1986) reported that supplementation of aged mice (24 mo old) with dietary vitamin E (500 ppm) improved several indices of the immune system to levels comparable to those seen in young animals. Supplementation of aged mice with this vitamin also increased clearance of influenza virus from the lung to that observed in animals supplemented with other antioxidants such as melathonine, GSH, or strawberry extract, which contains a high level of flavonoids with antioxidant activity . In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Meydani and colleagues (Meydani, Barklund, & Lui, 1990; Meydani et al., 1997) also reported that supplementation of elderly subjects with vitamin E for a short (1 mo) or long (4.5 too) period of time also improved several in vitro and in vivo indices of immune response. The optimal immune response was observed with 200 IU of vitamin E per day in the long-term study. It is worth noting that this level of vitamin E has also been reported to be the optimal level for reducing plasma F2-isoprostane, a reliable index of lipid peroxidation (Dillon, Vita, & Leeuwenburgh, 1998) . Improving the immune response in the elderly may result in a lower incidence of infections, which are prevalent among the elderly, and thus may contribute to a longer and healthier life. Many observational and clinical trials have also indicated that a high intake or high plasma level of this vitamin is associated with a low risk of cardiovascular disease. The vitamin may be operating at two levels; first, by protecting LDL from peroxidation, thereby reducing its atherogenicity, and second, by lowering the level of chronic inflammation by downregulation of NF-r,B. A reduction in platelet aggregability may also arise out of this action (Huang et al., 2001; Tanus-Santos et al., 2002) . Indeed, several lines of evidence indicated that supplements of vitamin E may prevent cardiovascular disease by reducing the susceptibility of LDLs to oxidation (Jailal, Fuller, & Huet, 1995) , reducing the expression of chemokines, adhesion molecule expression, and monocyte adhesion (Wu, Koga, Martin, & Meydani, 1999) , decreasing smooth muscle proliferation (Azzi, Boscoboinik, & Marilley, 1995) , and decreasing platelet aggregation (Steiner 1999) .",

            "text": "Fish oil supplementation is not universally efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory disease (Grimble, 1998) . Rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease have been the most successfully treated of all inflammatory diseases (Calder, 1997) . The antiinflammatory mechanism may be through suppression of TNF-tx production. Endres et al. (1989) reported that large doses (15 g/d for 6 wk) of oil in nine healthy volunteers resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction in TNF-o~ and IL-1 [3 production from PBMCs. Subsequently, fewer than half of 11 similar small intervention studies were able to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in cytokine production. To understand the differences in response more closely, the author's laboratory conducted a study on 111 young men fed 6 g fish oil daily for 12 wk and measured TNF-tx production by PBMCs before and after supplementation in relation to the SNP at -308 in the TNF-o~ and at +252 in the LT-tx genes. No significant effect of fish oil on cytokine production was noted in the group as a whole. However, when data were examined according to tertile of TNF-ct production prior to supplementation, homozygosity for TNFB2 (LT-o~+ 252 A) was 2.5 times more frequent in the highest than in the lowest tertile of production. The percentage of individuals in whom fish oil suppressed production was lowest (22%) in the lowest tertile and doubled with each ascending tertile. In the highest tertile, mean values were decreased by 43% (p < 0.05). In the lowest tertile, mean values were increased by 62% (p < 0.05). TNFB2 (LT-cz+252 AA) homozygotes were strongly represented among unresponsive individuals in the lowest tertile of TNF-cz production prior to supplementation. In this lowest tertile, only TNFB l/B2 (LT-o~+252 GA) heterozygous subjects were responsive to the suppressive effects of fish oil. In the medium tertile, this genotype was six times more frequent than other LT-t~ genotypes among responsive individuals. No relationship between possession of TNF 1 or 2 (TNF-ot-308 G or A) alleles and responsiveness to fish oil was found. Clearly, although the level of inflammation determines whether fish oil will exert an anti-inflammatory influence or not and is influenced by the TNFB2 (LT-ct+252 A) allele, the precise genomic mechanism for an anti-inflammatory effect is unclear at present .",

In a study on healthy men and women and smokers, dietary supplementation with 600 IU/d ct-tocopherol for 1 mo suppressed the ability of PBMCs to produce TNF-t~. Production was reduced by 22 and 33% in nonsmokers and smokers, respectively (Mol et al., 1997) . In a similar dietary intervention study on normolipaemic and hypertriglyceridaemic subjects given 600 IU/ d of o~-tocopherol for 6 wk, reduced TNF-o~, IL-113, and IL-8 production by LPS-stimulated blood mononuclear cells occurred (Mol et al., 1997; van Tits, Demacker, de Graaf, Hak-Lemmers, & Stalenhoef, 2000) . A similar effect of cx-tocopherol was noted in a study on normal subjects and type 2 diabetics (Devaraj & Jialal, 2000) . However, there were large standard deviations in the data from these studies, indicating major intraindividual variability in the ability of vitamin E to suppress production of the cytokine. Although a number of studies have shown that o~-tocopherol suppresses superoxide production, the situation with regard to nitric oxide is less clear (Mol et al., 1997; van Tits et al., 2000) n The a-tocopherol derivative pentamethyl-hydroxychromane inhibited LPS-stimulated NF-gB and iNOS activation in cultured J774 macrophages (Hattori, 1995) . At present it is not known whether antioxidants interact differently with SNPs in the genes associated with oxidant stress and inflammation than they do with the other anti-inflammatory nutrient, n-3 PUFA. This topic is currently an area of active research at the author's laboratory.",

However, within the response lie the seeds of disaster at an individual level, for the inflammatory component of the response can turn against the body, particularly as the body ages or becomes obese. The response, which can be devastating when directed against microbes entering the body, also sows the seeds of atherosclerosis, degradation of brain function, and insulin insensitivity and hastens the passage of HIV-infected individuals towards full-blown AIDS. Along with the insights arising from the unraveling of the human genome has come evidence that the inflammatory response is able to protect the human species from invasion by pathogens but not all individuals within the species from ill health. The differing ability of humans, particularly the male of the species, at an individual level to mount an inflammatory response of different levels of intensity owing to genotype can result in widely contrasting outcomes of invasion of the body by pathogens. On the one hand, individuals may effectively fight off invasion provided the immune response follows a normal pathway, whereas other individuals within the same community encoutering the same pathogens will die from the strength and nature of the response rather than from the direct effects of the invader. Insights gained from the genomic influences on cytokine production and the response to malaria suggest that the retention of alleles in pro-inflammatory cytokine genes that resulted in enhanced cytokine production within the human gene pool over generations could be a result of the heterozygotes' better capacity for fighting pathogens, whereas homozygotes of the high-producing genotype run an increased risk of a strong adverse inflammatory response. In the case of sickle cell anemia, where heterozygotic individuals reap an advantage in resistance to malaria by possession of only one copy of the anemia allele, homozygous individuals for the sickle cell trait pay the price for possession of two copies of the allele and die young. Because of the overall advantage of this situation to the species, the potentially disadvantageous allele will be retained within the human gene pool over generations.",
