Since the lung disease and immunosuppression are interleukin -17 (IL-17) production with a specific inhibition on Th17 cells [13] . Then, we can speculate that suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T-cell activities by steroids and other immunosuppressive agents might be protective, even in SSc patients .

Very recently, Mihai et al. reported the observation of a SSc patient who developed a mild form of COVID-19, even in the presence of ILD treated with tocilizumab and type 2 diabetes mellitus [14]. More severe forms of COVID-19 are characterized by acute systemic inflammatory response and cytokine storm, which can result in injury to multiple organs. Different studies have shown that high circulatory levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines correlate with disease severity and poor J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof prognosis during SARS-CoV2 infection [15]. Inflammation occurs to restore the homeostasis after viral infection and could be harmful if excessive. In this respect, Xu et al [16] found an overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, in the peripheral blood of a patient suffering from a severe and lethal form of COVID-19. The authors suggested that the important immune response could account for, at least in part, the severe lung immune injury in COVID-19 patients. Likewise, lymphopenia has been suggested as the result of lung sequestration of hyperactivated T-cells. In other words, inflammatory response and overaction of both T cells immune response in viral pneumonia could be a double-edged sword. Although immunosuppressed SSc patients, particularly those with ILD, could be potentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection with severe clinical manifestations, the anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppression could decrease the clinical expression of disease. Besides specific anti-IL6 effects mediated by tocilizumab, both cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of patients with progressive SSc-ILD, act as regulator of proliferation, survival and maturation of T-cells. Furthermore, MMF inhibits",
