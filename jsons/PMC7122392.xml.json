These elegant studies, conceived by Carrel, initiated the modern day art of histoculture as it is now known.4,5\n",

            "text": "Primary cell culture involves the isolation of cells from a tissue by disaggregation. Single-cell suspensions from tissues can be completed through either enzymatic digestion of extracellular matrix surrounding the cells \u2013 such as with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, trypsin, or collagenase \u2013 or mechanical disaggregation. These disaggregation procedures have the disadvantage of possibly injuring cells. If the cells of interest are adherent viable cells, they will be separated from nonviable cells when the medium is changed. Alternatively, viable cells can be separated from nonviable cells before culture by subjecting the single-cell suspension to density-gradient centrifugation (e.g., Hypaque). Primary cells have an advantage of possessing many of the biological properties that they possessed in vivo because they are not transformed. Primary cells, unlike cell lines, are not immortal and have only a finite survival time in culture before becoming senescent. Variant cells, however, as well as those obtained from neoplastic tissue, may proliferate infinitely, thus becoming immortal in vitro. This development will eventually allow the immortal cell to take over the culture and can be thought of as a cell line. In general, primary human cultures will survive for 30\u201380 passages in vitro, although this number is dependent on cell type, conditions, and possibly other unknown factors. Primary cells are widely used to examine the effects of toxins, infectious agents, or other cellular interactions that would not be feasible in vivo. Primary cells have a disadvantage of being a heterogeneous mixture of cells upon primary isolation, with the type of cell obtained generally a component of the disaggregation method used. The most common contaminant seen following isolation of primary cells are cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g., fibroblasts). However, advances have been made that allow the culture of homogeneous populations of cells. For instance, cell-surface molecules specific for the cells of interest may be tagged with monoclonal antibodies. Techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting or the use of magnetic beads can be utilized to enrich the single-cell suspension for the cell type of interest. Additionally, some investigators have recently exploited unique characteristics of certain cells, such as the presence of P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance-associated proteins expressed on endothelial cells, to poison other contaminating cells in culture.7\n",

Many of the early cell lines were established from tumor tissue and as such possess abnormal growth characteristics. Newer cell lines have been established by molecular techniques such as inserting a telomerase gene into a cell to allow it to replicate infinitely.10 Because of the phenotypic changes that allow cell lines to replicate infinitely in culture, they are often a first choice for experiments; however, they are also highly criticized in light of their nonnatural phenotype.",

The utilization of tissue culture as a research methodology has allowed investigators to study isolated interactions in its near-normal environment. These experiments by their very nature introduce artifacts; however, they do minimize the number of confounding variables that may affect a particular experiment. For instance, tissue culture allows investigators to determine the effects of one particular treatment on a particular cell type, which would not be feasible in vivo. Additionally, tissue culture models of disease allow investigators to obtain samples and make observations more readily than those done in vivo. However, it is the relative simplicity of experiments done in vitro that allows models of disease or physiology to come under frequent and warranted criticism. These models do not take into consideration the complexity of biological systems. Diminishing possible confounding variables by culturing cells in vitro brings up the constant criticism of how applicable results are because of alterations of the normal cellular environment in vivo. For example, cell\u2013cell interactions in vitro are reduced and unnatural. Moreover, the culture does not contain the normal heterogeneity and three-dimensional architecture that are seen in vivo.

Fetal bovine serum is a common additive to most tissue culture media, although some investigators choose to forgo this additive for more defined supplementation. Additionally, others may choose sera from other sources such as human serum when culturing cells of human origin. Inactivation of complement by heat treating serum for 1 h at 56\u00b0C was initially very popular in tissue culture. However, it has become clear that this treatment may in fact damage some of the proteinaceous growth factors present in the medium, rendering it less effective. Currently, many experts recommend heat inactivation only if the cell type of interest is particularly sensitive to complement.13\n",

Recently, however, human type II alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) have been successfully isolated from fetal human lung tissue by collagenase digestion.36 Briefly, fetal lung tissues were minced and incubated in a serum-free medium containing dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate for 5 days. The tissue explants were then treated with collagenase and incubated with DEAE-dextran to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts.

Clusters of mammary cells were initiated into cultures, and Nandi and colleagues observed three-dimensional formation of ductile structures and sustained growth over a period of several weeks concordant with proliferation at the edge of the cell mass with minimal fibroblast contamination.41 Thus, mammary tissue cultured in the collagen gels resembled, histologically, in vivo tissue, differing significantly from two-dimensional monolayer cultures. Nandi et al suggested an important criterion for successful growth of mammary tissue-like structures in collagen gels, versus the monolayer culture, was maintenance of mammary cell shape in three dimensions as opposed to conventional monolayer culture. Many of the advantages of three-dimensional cultures seen by Leighton, Nandi, and others may be attributed to permitting the cells to retain their normal shape and special associations.4 This global concept will be important as we begin to understand and recall the physical and environmental characteristics of the rotating-wall vessel systems.",

The microgravity effect on bone decalcification has been documented beginning with early space flights and subsequently found to mimic conditions analogous to osteoporosis frequently seen in aging females. Over the past three decades, the relationship between cellular morphology and metabolism and the role of physical stress in bone loss has been studied. Physiomechanical stresses induce shape changes in osteoblasts, possibly mediated by reorganization of focal contacts. Thus, gravity variations (Gz) have been studied to understand their influence on osteoblast adhesion of ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells during 15\u201330 parabolic flights. Nontrivial flight-induced cell shape changes consisting of decreased area concordant with contact plaque reordering have been observed; however identical periods of continuous mechanical stress induced by centrifugation (2 Gz) or clinostatic rotation (Gz randomization) had no discernible effect on cell adhesion. Synchronization of ROS 17/2.8 G2/M accomplished via treatment in nocodazole inhibited the flight-induced decreases in adhesion parameters. Investigators thus concluded that ROS 17/2.8 cells possess the ability to sense Gz triggers and that adaptation is related to cytoskeletal function.59\n",

            "text": "Conventional culture systems for microcarrier cultures (i.e., bioreactors) use mechanical agitation to suspend microcarriers and thus induce impeller strikes as well as fluid shear and turbulence at the boundary layer between the wall and the fluid. Investigators have attempted to make a complete study of the most efficient bioreactor designs and agitation regimens.68 They concluded that virtually all stirred-tank bioreactors operate in the turbulent regimen. It has been demonstrated that bead-to-bead bridging of cells is enhanced significantly at lower agitation rates in a stirred reactor.69 Aggregates of as many as 12\u201315 microcarriers bridged with bovine embryonic kidney cells (BEK) have been reported. Excessive agitation from either stirring or gas bubble sparging has been documented as a cause of cell damage in microcarrier cell cultures.70,71 To overcome the problems induced by these mechanisms, investigators developed alternative culture techniques such as porous microcarriers to entrap cells,72 increased viscosity of culture medium,73 bubble-free oxygenation,74 and improved methods for quiescent inoculation.75,76 These steps decreased the damage attributed to turbulence and shear forces but failed to significantly rectify the problems. Reactor systems of substantially increased volume exhibit less agitation-related cell damage, presumably because of the decreased frequency of cell-microcarrier contact with the agitation devices in the systems. Research-scale investigations do not afford the luxury of experimenting with large-scale production systems. Therefore, if a large-volume system is indeed more quiescent, an improved bioreactor system should emulate the fluid dynamics present in the upper regions of large-scale reactors in which cells and microcarriers reside with minimal agitation. Microcarriers and cells in large-volume reactors are semibuoyant, rendering them practically weightless, a condition that we hypothesize may be analogous to the environment of microgravity. It is stated that \u201cUnless a cell culture is growing in an environment free of gravitational forces, moderate levels of agitation are required to suspend microcarriers that are not neutrally buoyant.\u201d73 The ability to grow cells in a rudimentary horizontally rotated chamber has been previously demonstrated and is intended to simulate in the laboratory the effects of weightlessness or microgravity on cells. It was shown that human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells attach to microcarriers in microgravity (Space Shuttle experiment) and that attachment and spreading may be enhanced in a weightless environment.77 Review articles of cell biology performed in space flight experiments delineate the growth of many cell types in an environment devoid of gravitational influence.78 The problem, then, is to suspend microcarriers and cells without inducing turbulence or shear while providing adequate oxygenation and nutritional replenishment. One environment that possesses these attributes is the microgravity of space flight. Another is the system referenced here, which randomizes the forces of gravity by classical methods, thus simulating some aspects of microgravity.",

Because of the presence of large tissue-like masses that express differentiated epithelial, mesenchymal, and developing endothelial cells, a multitude of possibilities are afforded for cell biological investigations, and further, functional epithelial cell brush borders with extracellular matrix and basal lamina components that represent ordering of tissue and cellular polarity were nurtured by the molecular conditions and physical orientations of the culture system. An important additional finding was that this 3-D model demonstrates a significantly diminished requirement of complex culture media, which suggests specific cell-cell interactions and the production of paracrine and autocrine factors essential to the growth and development of these fragile tissues.63\n\n",

Levels of endothelial cell (Factor VIII-positive) and epithelial cell (villin-positive) staining remained reasonably constant, while staining for angioblasts (endothelial precursor cells) developed toward the end of each experiment. Functional brush border markers such as sucrase were also present in this coculture system. Other brush border-specific monoclonal antibodies, kindly supplied by Dr. Andrea Quaroni (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), have similarly proved positive in more recent studies (unpublished results). Collectively, these results indicate that the model, although not histotypically correct, exhibits many facets of functional normal small intestine. Growth conditions, however, may still be skewed slightly in favor of the mesenchymal versus the epithelial cell types. Work will continue on further definition of the correct nutritional and growth-matrix requirements directed toward attaining the best representation possible. Interestingly, all the RWV cocultures exhibited laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen production, as well as large amounts of proteoglycan. Hahn states that only undifferentiated, highly proliferative intestinal epithelial cells (usually fetal) synthesize the aforementioned proteins.88 Of these, only laminin appeared to promote differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Type IV collagen and fibronectin had no effect.",

RWVs were used in conjunction with multicellular cocultivation to develop a unique in vitro tissue modeling system. Cells were cultivated on Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads, with and without mixed normal human colonic fibroblasts, which served as the mesenchymal layer. Culture of the tumor lines in the absence of fibroblasts produced spheroid-like growth and minimal differentiation. In contrast, when tumor lines were cocultivated with normal colonic fibroblasts, initial growth was confined to the fibroblast population until the microcarriers were covered. The tumor cells then commenced proliferation at an accelerated rate, organizing themselves into three-dimensional tissue masses that achieved 1.0- to 1.5-cm diameters. Each of these engineered tumor tissues produced tissue-like aggregates (TLAs) with glandular structures, apical and internal glandular microvilli, tight intercellular junctions, desmosomes, cellular polarity, sinusoid development, internalized mucin, and structural organization akin to normal colon crypt development. Necrosis was minimal throughout the tissue masses up to 60 days of culture while achieving >1.0 cm in diameter. Other notable results included enhanced growth of neoplastic colonic epithelium in the presence of mixed normal human colonic mesenchyme. These results mimic the cellular differentiation seen in vivo and are similar to results obtained with other tumor types.",

In particular, the LNCaP and ARCaP models represented in the review are known to be lethal in the human, being androgen independent and metastatic. Rotating-wall vessel TLA engineering also allowed in-depth study of epithelial and stromal interactions, which are the facilitating elements of the continuance of LNCaP prostate-specific antigen production in vitro. When LNCaP was cultured in three dimensions without stroma, production of prostate-specific antigen ceased, and metastatic markers were not observed. The authors outline the process of malignant transformation, demonstrating that these metastatic models are only possible in three-dimensional TLAs and are achieved by specific geometric relationships in three-dimensional configuration. Furthermore, they show through direct comparison with other culture systems the advantages of the RWV system to allow synergistic relationships to study this disease state.107\n",

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell research has primarily dealt with tumor cells in single suspension cultured in the presence of LAK cells in close proximity using 96-well plates. Although a substantial amount of literature exists in this field, no literature could be found investigating three-dimensional tumor models and the kill response elicited in the presence of LAK cells. We hypothesized that not only would the three-dimensional models more closely resemble in vivo tissue histologically, but they also could demonstrate a useful application of using three-dimensional models. Three breast carcinoma cell lines were chosen for this investigation: BT-20, an undifferentiated estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013 cell line; MCF-7, a moderately differentiated and metastatic ER+ cell line; and T-47D, an ER+ cell line. Each cell line was cultured in the RWV for a minimum of 21 days. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and placed in T-flasks at a cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml in the presence of rhIL-2. A modified procedure based on the standard 51Cr release assay was developed to quantitate the activity of LAK cell invasion of three-dimensional (3-D) RWV-grown tumor aggregates. Cells from T-flasks (2-D controls) or RWV-grown aggregates (3-D) were labeled with 51Cr and seeded into 12-well plates with LAK cells at a 10:1 ratio to the tumor cells. We chose the lowest ratio of effector cells to target cells compared to standard suspension cell protocols of using 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1. Spontaneous release controls were initiated identically without LAK cells. Supernatant samples were taken at 24-h and 48-h intervals and counted using a gamma counter. Maximum release data were obtained by lysing the entire cell population using Triton X-100. Cytokine analysis of the supernatant and flow cytometry analysis of the cytokine receptors were performed from samples taken at the same time points from a duplicate nonradiolabeled assay.",

Several studies have been conducted recently that indicate that three-dimensional tissues respond to infective agents with greater fidelity and with a more in vivo-like response than traditional two-dimensional cultures. Nickerson et al109 describe the development of a three-dimensional TLA engineered from INT-407 cells of the human small intestine, which were used as targets for the study of Salmonella typhimurium. In this study, three-dimensional TLAs were used to study the attachment, invasion, and infectivity of Salmonella into human intestinal epithelium. Immunocytochemical characterization and scanning and transmission electron microscopic analyses of the three-dimensional TLAs revealed that the TLAs modeled human in vivo differentiated tissues more accurately than did two-dimensional cultures. The level of differentiation in the INT-407 TLAs was analogous to that found in previously discussed small intestine TLAs62 and from other organ tissues reconstructed in rotating-wall vessels. Analysis of the infectivity studies revealed Salmonella attached and infected in a manner significantly different from that in control two-dimensional cultures. During an identical exposure period of infection with Salmonella, the three-dimensional TLAs displayed a minor loss of structural integrity when compared with the two-dimensional INT-407 cultures. Furthermore, Salmonella demonstrated a greatly reduced ability to adhere, invade, and induce the apoptotic event in these INT-407 three-dimensional TLAs than in two-dimensional cultures. This result is not unlike the in vivo human response. Two-dimensional cultures were significantly damaged within several hours of contact with the bacteria; conversely, although \u201cpot marks\u201d could be seen on the surfaces of the three-dimensional TLAs, they remained structurally sound.",

Immor-talized human epithelial cell lines, such as BEAS-2B,116 primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells,117 and air-liquid interface cultures,118 are used to study respiratory virus infections in vitro. Traditional monolayer cultures (two-dimensional) of immortalized human bronchoepithelial cells represent homogeneous lineages. Although growing cells in monolayers is convenient and proliferation rates are high, such models lack the morphology and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions characteristic of human respiratory epithelia. Thus, their state of differentiation and intracellular signaling pathways most likely differ from those of epithelial cells in vivo. Primary cell lines of human bronchoepithelial cells provide a differentiated model similar to the structure and function of epithelial cells in vivo; however, this state is short lived in vitro.117,119 Air-liquid interface cultures of primary human bronchoepithelial cells (or submerged cultures of human adenoid epithelial cells) are grown on collagen-coated filters in wells on top of a permeable filter. These cells receive nutrients basolaterally, and their apical side is exposed to humidified air. The result is a culture of well-differentiated heterogeneous (ciliated, secretory, basal) epithelial cells essentially identical to airway epithelium in situ.118,120 Although this model shows fidelity to the human respiratory epithelium in structure and function, maintenance of consistent cultures is not only difficult and time consuming but also limited to small-scale production and thus limits industrial research capability.",

            "text": "Viral studies by Goodwin et al129 and Suderman et al130 were conducted with RWV-engineered TLA models of normal human lung. This model is composed of a coculture of in vitro three-dimensional human bronchoepithelial TLAs engineered using a rotating-wall vessel to mimic the characteristics of in vivo tissue and to provide a tool to study human respiratory viruses and host\u2013pathogen cell interactions. The TLAs were bioengineered onto collagen-coated cyclodextran beads using primary human mesenchymal bronchial tracheal cells as the foundation matrix and an adult human bronchial epithelial immortalized cell line (BEAS-2B) as the overlying component. The resulting TLAs share significant characteristics with in vivo human respiratory epithelium, including polarization, tight junctions, desmosomes, and microvilli. The presence of tissue-like differentiation markers, including villin, keratins, and specific lung epithelium markers, as well as the production of tissue mucin, further confirm these TLAs differentiated into tissues functionally similar to in vivo tissues. Increasing virus titers for human respiratory syncytial virus (wtRSVA2) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (wtPIV3 JS) and the detection of membrane-bound glycoproteins (F and G) over time confirm productive infections with both viruses. Viral growth kinetics up to day 21 pi with wtRSVA2 and wtPIV3 JS were as follows: wtPIV3 JS replicated more efficiently than wtRSVA2 in TLAs. Peak replication was on day 7 for wtPIV3 JS [approximately 7 log10 particle-forming units (pfu) per milliliter] and on day 10 for wtRSVA2 (approximately 6 log10 pfu/ml). Viral proliferation remained high through day 21 when the experiments were terminated. Viral titers for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus were approximately 2 log10 pfu/ml at 2 days post inoculation.",

A model that more closely links the expression of specific antibodies in normal lung cells, transformed lung cells, and cancerous lung cells to cellular biology may provide new information about cancer. The development of three-dimensional cell cultures in bioreactors may ultimately provide a model that facilitates discovery and interpretation of more relevant information for the expression of an antibody and its role in cellular pathobiology of the lung.",
