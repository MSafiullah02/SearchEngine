In this study, we found that more infants born at term who were admitted to the PICU had dual infections than did infants born prematurely, but we could not demonstrate statistical significance. Larger studies, which pool data from several winter seasons, are necessary to investigate this phenomena.",

This discordance raises the possibility that bronchiolitis caused by hMPV is more prevalent than is currently recognized and that it has been underreported because the virus has not been found in the nasopharynx. This possibility contrasts with what was observed for bronchiolitis caused by hRSV, in which the virus is usually detected in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Collection of BAL samples would therefore appear to be the preferred sampling method for the detection of hMPV in infants receiving mechanical ventilation. For infants who do not require mechanical ventilation, nasopharyngeal secretions will remain the only acceptable source for sampling.",

The prevalence ofhMPV infection in cases of bronchiolitis may be underreported because of the pragmatic limitations to the collection of BAL samples from infants who do not require mechanical ventilation. Several clinical studies are currently investigating the immunopathogenesis of severe bronchiolitis caused by hRSV. In any given bronchiolitis season there may be several different endemic viruses. Severe disease in an individual can be understood to be a function of host response to a particular virus. To improve our understanding of host response, we must now search for multiple viral pathogens and examine the timing and sequence of viral infections. We would be wise to seek consent to archive samples, to allow for retrospective investigations of the influence of presently unknown pathogens that may confound current studies of bronchiolitis.",
