In particular, the wealth of data and knowledge on the Internet and its World Wide Web should lead to improved clinical decision support (CDS) by computer systems, i.e. to improved clinical decision support systems CDSS [1]. Prior to the growth of the Internet, software with similar goals, such as that of the pioneering Stanford MYCIN project [2] did, of course, exist, and it is notable that right from the outset, most such systems developed for medicine were seen as needing to consider probabilistic measures, such as degrees of certainty, to be associated with statements of clinical or biomedical knowledge [1], [2]. However, these were Expert Systems that obtained their knowledge offline by useful statements about the world inputted with associated probabilities estimated by human experts, often seen as requiring a specialist human knowledge engineer to act as mediator, and overall representing a very time-consuming process [1], [2]. We recently introduced a CDS application called MARPLE [3]. MARPLE stands for Medical Automated Reasoning Programming Language Environment. A common theme of work of this kind is that it involves a repository of knowledge in a form that computers can more readily use. Such a repository for prediction and decision making is said to be a knowledge representation store (KRS). Any kind of KRS is a set of syntactic and semantic conventions that describe things and relationships. Any specific example from such a store is a knowledge element or KRS element, that early Expert System designers might describe as a kind of frame\n[1], [2]. MARPLE rests on a considerable body of previous work by ourselves, collaborators, and other workers, and these efforts close to its essential features are first reviewed here (this Section 1). We also introduce the new version, MARPLE 2, which has significant advantages in helping ensure the quality of the above knowledge, an important consideration as follows.",

However, studies like MARPLE are timely. There has been an escalating interest in \u201cBig Data\u201d and rapid progress in data mining of it [1], including of electronic health records [1], [5]. The input data being \u201cmined\u201d is usually conveniently classified as of two types (a) structured data as in spreadsheets but also including relatively structured data as in electronic health records (EHRs) or similar public health sources, and (b) so-called unstructured data, in the present case simply meaning that it is mainly represented by natural language text (NLT) on web pages and other medical text accessible in digital form. MARPLE gets some of its knowledge to use, test, or further curate if necessary from offline digital repositories of data and other knowledge collections [1], [4], [5], and from the automatic \u201csurfing\u201d of the Internet, particularly to extract knowledge from NLT as described in this paper. Because of the escalating quantity of information obtained by data mining, and with future applications to CDS in a real clinical setting in mind, the quality of it as usable and authentic knowledge is of concern. MARPLE draws on both structured and unstructured data not least because each has well known strengths and weaknesses. Notably, while structured data mining can efficiently provide probabilities to certain important kinds of knowledge, mining natural language text on the Internet usually faces the problem that prevalence may reflect matters of interest and newsworthiness in inverse relation to actual frequency of occurrences in the \u201creal world\u201d. Combining elements of knowledge from various sources and exploring means of overcoming the above kind of probability problem are by no means unique to our efforts (e.g. Ref. [6]). Nonetheless, the escalation of collected knowledge makes it difficult to keep up with ensuring its quality.",

Especially with applications to CDS in real clinical settings in mind, knowledge elements should come as much as possible from good sources and adequately represent the originally intended information, but in a form usable by computers. In our definition, all aspects of this including tidying, correction, and even rejection if necessary, represent curation, briefly reviewed in Section 1.8. The MARPLE project is primarily a study to develop better methods for curation of KRS elements for CDS. In addition to structured and unstructured data mining, MARPLE also gets some of its knowledge from human experts just as was the case in Expert Systems like MYCIN [2] and as persists for many CDSS today [1], [5]. However, with MARPLE, the role of the human expert has primarily become one of auditor, and of curation not creation of KRS elements already obtained automatically by data mining. Compared with early Expert Systems, the human role is now more responsive rather than proactive. This is important because having human experts provide knowledge in good form is long known to be time-consuming [1], [2], and it is easier to automate a task of this well-defined nature.",

            "text": "The prominent, unusual, and perhaps controversial feature of MARPLE [3] is that, as one of its tests of quality of knowledge, it attempts the kind of multiple choice examinations given to medical students as a major part of the process of satisfying medical licensing boards. These tests are undertaken by medical students to obtain a license to practice medicine, and as practice and self-assessment tests in preparation for taking these (see Section 1.9). Only secondarily is our project an investigation of how the same algorithms might be applicable to CDS, though this is potentially an important spin-off. As with real students, along with formally receiving knowledge, practicing these exams is part of the learning process. Similarly, MARPLE is told the official \u201ccorrect answer\u201d, but only after it has made an attempt to answer the question, which contributes the official final exam score when we present results as if it were an exam taken by a medical student. Curation of the KRS to satisfy the criterion of good exam performance and learning from the examinations (as well as \u201clearning\u201d by receiving knowledge from data mining) become essentially the same thing. The level of automation of curation is already fairly high. There is only human intervention into the KRS when MARPLE persistently fails to answer an exam questions correctly. Before that happens, MARPLE takes considerable effort to seek out the knowledge required to answer the exam question, without human intervention.2\nBy inspecting the question and most importantly the candidate answers, MARPLE queries the Internet and, having extracted knowledge from one web page, it explores more deeply by searching in turn on links found, including any found in a list of scientific references.",

            "text": "Having a computer tackle medical school exams might seem likely to require fairly advanced techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, our preliminary studies [3] suggested that while such exams obviously test some important qualitative aspects of captured knowledge, they represent a rather restricted and \u201cartificially crisp\u201d world, to allow the student every chance to verify his or her knowledge. Our study is allowing us to comment of features that are of educational interest, as well a dissecting out some issues that do suggest some useful tools for CDS that are at least of the flavor of AI. For example, such exams still clearly test knowledge, but usually the reasoning with that knowledge almost always only requires presyllogistic logic, a term that we introduce in more detail in Section 5.1 but provide the theoretical basis in 2.3, 2.4. Apart from calculation questions that are excluded in the present study, very few exceptions to that have been found. Whereas more complete logic will be important for applications like CDS, it is a powerful pre-filter. It relates to the somewhat surprising finding that so-called contextual probabilities were sufficient [3]. These were originally intended just to be rough empirical estimates of prior probabilities for identifying the most likely answer, but they worked well with or without the support of the more precise kinds of intrinsic probabilities that are much more familiar, and which we would ideally like to test for CDS as well as flat statements of knowledge. These are probabilities as degrees of truth or scope intrinsically associated with each such statement. MARPLE 2 has a much improved ability to separate parts of the calculations and the parts of the KRS so that we can perform \u201ccomputer experiments\u201d giving insight into the above issues, as described in this paper. We also describe technological progress since MARPLE 1. It is by processes of Internet searching, preliminary curation, later automatic sweeps of curation, and human intervention if necessary, that MARPLE 1 learned from examination questions as well as from the more general curated medical knowledge given [3]. However, the essential features of MARPLE 1 are not specific to medicine. For example, wherever first directed to search on the Internet, it could still ultimately start to gather more general knowledge of any kind. Although not without theoretical interest and indirect clinical value, the effort required is a heavy price to pay for success in medical school exams. MARPLE 2 is much more efficient by knowing how to focus on scholarly medical texts. Last but not least, the present paper explores curation as reduction of a kind of \u201cnoise\u201d that MARPLE 2 helps reduce, as follows.",

            "text": "An educational analogy may be helpful. Generating and using well curated KRS elements as more formal teaching resembles supervised learning in schools and universities in formal classes, while knowledge as rougher extracts gathered from searching the Internet outside of formal class seems less organized, broader, diffuse, and vaguer, essentially analogous to that in unsupervised learning by a medical student reading and researching outside of formal class. When knowledge of a more general nature is collected over a long period, its use in an exam may seem like intuition and making hunches. It seems \u201cnoisy\u201d, in practice meaning that exam scores can deteriorate if there is too much reliance upon it. By \u201cnoise\u201d in this present paper we essentially simply mean imperfections in the KRS evidenced by deteriorated examination performance, and repairing this is a major part of the curation and learning process. This arises from the fact that MARPLE can use information extracted from the Internet while still in a premature, rougher, and less well curated state. For this reason, MARPLE 2 benefits from being more focused. In the process of extraction there is some natural language processing as curation: extracts of source text that often but not always correspond to sentences are parsed and put into a canonical form so that MARPLE can at least sufficiently \u201cunderstand\u201d them. Some extracted elements will already essentially be in good form for that and even for future CDS applications. What the many remaining elements lack in sophistication, they can in principle make up in considerable abundance, as described throughout this paper. Exam performance indeed improves with Internet searching, since more time searching provides more knowledge likely to help answer the question, but as thousands or hundreds of thousands of extracts accumulate exam performance starts to deteriorate to a lower plateau of performance. It seems natural to use the above unsupervised learning analogy or, in a little more detail, assume that it represents fluctuations in information that do not in practice cancel out, as if there is an increasing probability of confusing or contradicting previous statements of knowledge. Theoretically, however, it seems somewhat of a paradox that is investigated in this paper.",

It may therefore be asked why the rougher knowledge the Internet is not better curated as it arrives. In practice, automatic curation takes some time for hundreds of thousands of knowledge elements if there is to be any degree of \u201csmartness\u201d or sophistication, e.g. taking account of semantic and knowledge considerations beyond simple basic correction grammatical processing. At the same time, the exam helps here by pinpointing what elements of knowledge need to be present and curated. The greater focus by MARPLE 2 on what is more immediately needed is therefore important. Since hundreds of thousands of extracts of knowledge can be generated in a day, the required information is likely to be found, even if found element by element, but it has to be recognized as \u201cpromising\u201d. That this brute force approach works at all is explicable as follows. The underlying algorithm attempts to see relevant knowledge by piecing a small chain of several KRS elements, i.e. a \u201cchain of associations\u201d. Single elements of knowledge can answer a question, but that is usually insufficient except with questions that test simple matters of definition. More precisely, a small network of relevant knowledge elements tends to form between question and each answer, each contributing a different estimated probability or weight, and the overall weight of evidence ideally identifies the most probable candidate answer. The rougher elements freshly acquired from searching the Internet can be tolerated as contributing evidence in the overall argumentation process, somewhat analogous to use of circumstantial evidence in a court of law. Evidently, however, in the present case that can lead to noise in information of predictive or explanatory value that can cloud final judgment.",

            "text": "IBM\u2019s Watson system [6], [7], [8], [9] that beat humans in the TV quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d seems the most interesting other effort to compare because a general knowledge quiz like \u201cJeopardy!\u201d has obvious similarities to taking a university examination. Also, a Google query IBM Watson health at time of writing this paper claims over 3 million results, showing that Watson is being preened for exploitation in healthcare. Technical comparison with medical versions of Watson is difficult because while the earlier reports (e.g. Refs. [7], [8] are of a scientific nature, accounts of applications of Watson in medicine [9], and hints regarding medical licensing examinations [10], [11], are essentially news items or anecdotal. It seems clear, however, that the issue of whether or not computers really can pass medical licensing examinations is in particular by no means closed by the performance in \u201cJeopardy!\u201d That was a competition against humans, and scoring as incorrect the questions that Watson did not answer (as is appropriate in an examination), Watson fared less well [12]. Technical comparison has proven difficult in any case, because the aims and methods of Watson and MARPLE are somewhat different. Watson is a \u201cGrand Challenge\u201d selected to demonstrate the power of high performance computers as much as the skills of their programmers. MARPLE runs on a standard laptop and is part of a larger experimental prototype system for a future probabilistic \u201cThinking Web\u201d starting with healthcare and intended to be distributed freely over more standard servers. Because the primary aim is the curation of knowledge elements for CDS, and the second is that some techniques developed to take part in exams may be applicable to CDS, MARPLE has no recriminations in searching the Internet for answers even during an exam (Section 1.2), a luxury forbidden to any contestant in \u201cJeopardy!\u201d This is in any case important for MARPLE because it allows it to use the Internet as a \u201cmemory extension\u201d by querying on the question and particularly each answer rather than rely only on limited personal computer resources. Knowledge in Watson is used in probabilistic way, but in the Watson as developed for \u201cJeopardy!\u201d, probabilities were assigned in order to \u201clay bets\u201d on answers to quiz questions being correct using an empirical probability estimate based on different degree of confidence in the answers proposed by various subsystems, in the context of each question type. With future CDS applications in mind, the probabilities in our systems are so-called intrinsic probabilities mentioned in Section 1.2 that ideally come closer to those familiar in biostatistics, epidemiology and evidence based medicine such as risk factors [1], although it is contextual probabilities, also mentioned in Section 1.2, that emerge as better tested in the exam context [3]. The latter probabilities seem to come closer to Watson\u2019s. Nonetheless, in MARPLE this is currently governed by a single algorithm and essentially a single equation (Section 2.4).",

            "text": "For discussing the theoretical basis, we continue to use the notation standard and associated probabilistic algebra due to theoretical physicist Paul Dirac. It was developed in the 1930s to 1940s [13] for quantum mechanics (QM) [14] and author Robson and colleagues have adapted it for classical inference over several years [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. MARPLE owes a debt to a considerable body of work going back to efforts in early data mining in bioinformatics in the 1970s, as reviewed in Refs. [20], [23], [27]. Dirac notation may be an accepted standard in physics and so its use here may please physicists, but to most readers it is still largely an unfamiliar approach and somewhat less essential for understanding here because QM is about intrinsic probabilities, and it is extrinsic probabilities that played the important role in exams (as discussed above, and in Ref. [3]). However, QM represents a huge of amount of done work, integrated in a way that provides a unified formal picture, to which we can refer. Notably, an important consideration for CDS is that Dirac\u2019s work leads to mathematics that allows an inference network to be a general graph, including cyclic paths, rather than artificially restricted to a directed acyclic graph as is traditionally (and actually by definition) characteristic of a Bayes Net approach [20]. MARPLE was developed in that context and it is a Q-UEL application, testing knowledge in a Q-UEL system. The \u201cQ\u201d in Q-UEL is a reference to QM and Dirac\u2019s notation and algebra on which Q-UEL is based. The \u201cUEL\u201d is a reference to the \u201cXML-like\u201d Universal Exchange Language requested for healthcare by the (US) President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) in 2010 [24]. This resulted in the development of Q-UEL interoperability language and the prototype Q-UEL system based on it [25], [26], [27], [28]. MARPLE KRS elements are, or are readily inter-convertible with, Q-UEL communication artifacts called tags (by analogy with XML). All Q-UEL tags are not only based on Dirac notation, but can also have analogous algebraic roles. They are usually in the common Dirac \u201cbra-operator-ket\u201d form <subject|relationship|object>, associated with a complex number that encodes two probabilities, the first for the statement as read, and the second as read with subject and object switched. It is also called a Semantic Triple (ST) because it has three parts, analogous to subject-verb-object (SVO) clause. The knowledge represented in these can interchange with preexisting Q-UEL applications such as POPPER [22], and DiracBuilder [23], and its sources are human experts inputted via POPPER HELPER [23] and structured data mining such as DiracMiner [23], as well as other Q-UEL applications and clinical data repositories [27], [28].The knowledge from the Internet which is said to be less well curated form (Section 1.3) is captured as attribute values called XTRACTs in Q-UEL XTRACT tags generated by the automatic browser and surfer called XTRACTOR [27]. It is these XTRACTs that are the rougher knowledge elements that are extracted from source text. When an XTRACT is finally well curated, it may become one or more STs, but usually it becomes one or more Linear Semantic Multiples (LSMs). Seen as the parsed form of a sentence, each LSM is a linear graph, a single path, extracted from it (the parsed form could be a linear path already). In format the LSMs looks like a break with Dirac notation and Q-UEL\u2019s so-called general specification\n[27], but they can merely be interpreted as convenient abbreviated forms of certain Dirac expressions. Nonetheless, there are significant practical advantages (see Section 2.3). Notably, the LSM helps avoid or reduce a combinatorial explosion of possibilities that similarly arises in the Feynman Path Integral [29]. Roughly speaking, this is a kind of inference net in QM, with analogies to the exam problem.",

            "text": "XTRACTOR is an invisible automatic browser that \u201cautosurfs\u201d the Internet to obtain the QUEL tags called XTRACT tags [27]. An XTRACT typically, but by no means always, corresponds to an original sentence in natural language text on a web page. It is reparsed into a more canonical form that is as close to an LSM as possible, grammatically annotated. However, this retains source links, and subsequently XTRACTOR can surf automatically on links including those in scientific citations. Hence the impression is that XTRACTs can spawn other XTRACTS from the links. If it later encountered text that had no links, an additional small application enabled it to build new queries from the content and so \u201ckeep on surfing\u201d. In MARPLE the exam itself generates the queries. MARPLE can use content of the exam question to do that but initially it works through the essential content of candidate answers as queries, one at a time. Since it can, if permitted, keep on re-adressing. exams, with or without new questions, it can keep on accumulating, and helping curate, knowledge from the Internet. An exam will of course give searches a more specific focus, the topics covered by questions. MARPLE 2 is more efficient because it checks that web pages are of scholarly medical character before any XTRACTs are generated. While general knowledge is important, it comes at a high price of distracting from the main curation activity and by adding to the above combinatorial explosion (Section 1.8). It draws from two new two dictionaries of words and phrases that are, and that are not, characteristic of \u201cserious medical writing\u201d, and using a common topic algorithm it assesses the degree of appropriateness of every web page before XTRACTs are obtained. XTRACTOR tended to draw on Wikipedia [27] because its analytic techniques were well set up to understand Wikipedia web pages, but it was by no means confined to it, and might not use it at all. Sources like PubMed were a common option [27]. MARPLE 2 always starts by submitting queries to Wikipedia and by using its own essentially simple query system, not riding on that of Google as MARPLE 1 could do, and as was done extensively in our earlier XTRACTOR efforts [27]. MARPLE 2 also keeps track of links to web pages it has examined before and avoids revisiting them in a single run, i.e. in the course of an exam. It has a list pre-specified sources to search if it ever gets stuck, e.g. if there are no links, or the sources do not look like scholarly medical text. Nonetheless, in routine ongoing operation it is encouraged to revisit web pages that may be rewritten by experts over the years, in order to capture many different ways of expressing same knowledge. When reading each item on a KRS to find those relevant to an exam question, MARPLE 2 repairs more obvious format damage and checks that noun and relationship phrases are in the right slots between delimiters and in correct sequence (but it does not delete the element if there are difficulties). Unlike its predecessor, MARPLE 2 can convert quantitative clinical data in questions to low, normal, or high ranges. It considers that low, normal or high, not the original numeric value, is the important description in a knowledge element. Last but not least, MARPLE 2 facilitates switching on and off of various algorithmic contributions and blocks of knowledge so that some surprising findings in MARPLE 1 can be explored.",

            "text": "Review of curation is hampered because definitions vary. Digital curation in general is a better defined discipline [30\u201331], but it emphasizes interoperability and extensibility that Q-UEL has already sought to address, and we have already reviewed these (e.g. Refs. [27], [28]). The word \u201ccuration\u201d does not appear as often as one might expect in literature about the Semantic Web (SW) [32], probably simply because curation of knowledge into a widely usable canonical form is the whole point of the SW. It is common to read that an author is \u201cusing the tools of the SW\u201d to curate other digital data (e.g. Ref. [33]). MYCIN had facilities for capturing and curating knowledge from human experts [2]. The larger INTERNIST Expert System effort [34] provided facilities for capturing and curating tens of thousands of statements of knowledge, perhaps now 100,000 or more, for diagnosis in internal medicine, over many years [34]. Both these systems [2], [34] could use something like an exam or test to help curate knowledge and made comparison with human experts under same conditions, and since these were genuine experts in specific fields these could be regarded as much harder tests. However, an overall comprehensive exam as taken by MARPLE is not necessarily easier, because medical experts in one field often forget their medical lessons in other fields. Within our own Q-UEL effort, there has significant amount of work related to facilities for manual curation (e.g. by POPPER HELPER [22]) and automatic curation (e.g. using aids like THESAURUS [27]) in the Q-UEL project, Ref. [6] provided a good example by other workers of the fairly general sense in which we also interpret curation.",

            "text": "In education science, there are always ongoing efforts improve the fairness and testing power of multiple choice medical examinations (e.g. Ref. [35]). The questions presented by such sources are excellent for testing and training MARPLE, because they provide a more realistic clinical scenario and because of the demands they place on the discerning power of the KRS elements. For example, there is increasing interest in \u201cExtended-Matching (R-Type) Items\u201d, basically a single large sent of answers to which many different questions are directed [35]. However, they are not at time of writing typical of qualifying exams, and the more typical and recent questions actually used in real final medical licensing exams are not so easy to obtain and share in any significant quantity. Licensing boards like that for the USMLE hold copyright on actual exam and practice questions [36]. While they make these available for practice via the Internet, they usually prohibit and digitally block copying and distribution. This is somewhat impeding research and sharing in the field of automated tackling of medical school exams, but since the field is barely emergent it is hardly seen as a problem. Fortunately many professors construct their own questions and make them available in text books and lecture presentations [37], though excessive copying and distribution still risks raising copyright issues. The examples used in our papers are chosen cautiously to respect original authors and publishers and do not represent the full set used in testing. Published clinical case studies [38] can be readily adapted to form exam questions by presenting the symptoms and tests and removing the clinician\u2019s interpretations, and these are especially valuable for MARPLE by testing the decisions made in real clinical practice. However, the text forming the question part can represent up to a third or half of the original published paper, raising even stronger copyright issues.",

For fairness to the student, an exam normally requires only the kind of mental manipulations that humans do naturally and fairly well. Notable here are the simpler uses of syllogistic logic. For example, given the two statements that rubeola virus causes measles and that the typical manifestation of measles is a rash, we can deduce that a rash may indicate rubeola virus but only sometimes, because, for example, very similar rashes may be due to other causes such as rubella. Each statement in a syllogism can be of explicit or implicit universal (\u201call\u201d), or existential (\u201csome\u201d), including universal negative (\u201cno\u201d) or existential negative (\u201cnot all\u201d, \u201csome not\u201d) character.

We can then also compute probabilities involved in syllogisms, e.g. <A | R | C> = <A | R | B><B | R | C>.

In addition, the role of determiners, \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d \u201csome\u201d etc., is demoted (except for negatives). Details as implemented in MARPLE 2 are as follows.(I)First, in this preliminary step, content is represented in a simpler and rather more canonical form. So-called \u201ctrivial words\u201d that are removed are actually really ignored, because they correspond to the determiners such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201csome\u201d, \u201call\u201d, many etc. that we may (or may not) wish to use them later in curation. However, negative forms such as \u201cno\u201d, are not ignored.(II)All the noun fields F, i.e. A, B, C, etc. between relators in a LSM are each kept intact in word order, and held separately, but as above, each has so called \u201ctrivial words\u201d ignored.(III)This is repeated in terms of individual words W, again after all so-called \u201ctrivial words\u201d have been removed. It may be helpful to think of a larger number of fields, each now a single word, but for clarity they are still called words rather than fields.(IV)NF is now computed as the number of fields that are common to any two specified tags, or between a specified tag and the question, or a specified tag and a specified answer.(V)NW is now computed as the number of words that are common to any two specified tags, or between a specified tag and the question, or a specified tag and a specified answer.(VI)We now consider separately the number of fields, and then words, when at least one of the two tags (or question or an answer) contain at least one positive verb form\nR, S, T, etc., as NF+ and NW+ respectively.(VII)We also consider separately the number of fields, and then words, when at least one of the two tags (or question or an answer) contain at least one negative verb form\nR, S, T, etc., as NF- and NW- respectively.\n",

However, there are automatic techniques or equivalent with somewhat analogous effect considered below and in next Section 2.6. Another is that new things of potential interest usually have to be observed several times before they start to have significant impact. Eq. (13) indicates that a virtual frequency v is added to the counts immediately before use by the zeta function to represent a kind of absolute prior frequency (in actuality v is added inside the zeta subroutine function as called, but the above is the appropriate mathematical representation). The value of v is rather larger than has been the case in previous studies, as this quenches the considerable noise due to use of knowledge representation tags that may as yet be poorly curated. This should be seen in the context of an additional scoring and bonus systems described later below that modifies the value of counts NF+, NW+ . As a probability, MARPLE computes an associated probit probability, i.e. that implies the use of predictive odds distorted monotonically into a probability form by imposing normalization.(15)P(F+)=eI(F+:F\u2212)/Z\n",

If no tags are found in the knowledge store that satisfy a path between question and answer, then an automatic consequence of the above is that all answers have equal probability, i.e. 1/n for n answers.

This is a multiplicative scaling factor to reflect the fact that observations of occurrence some circumstances carry more weight than others, and in effect such scaling assigns \u201cbonus scores\u201d. Everything generally scores 1, e.g. if F+ is seen 8 times then the NF+ = 8 and 8 + v is used as the independent variable or argument of the zeta function, with the following exceptions that imply the use of the weightings or \u201cbonus scores\u201d. However, When there is common content with the question and with the set of answers the value of NF+ replaced by W\u00d7NF+ such as10\u00d78=80, and similarly for NF-.

Recall that the incrementing of counts and weighting NF+ and NF-, is applied to fields, and then repeated for NW+ and NW- for individual words as fields according to Eq. (13). Subsequently, this all repeated yet again using more challenging criteria for commonality of content (Section 3.3) especially the requirement that there common content with a specific answer.

Knowledge content from curated tags is seen as supervised learning, as from lectures that adhere to rigid syllabus, while crude XTRACT tags obtained from surfing the Web can be considered as unsupervised learning, like student reading of text books and journals.

Because this often involves taking out information related to test questions but putting it back into answer others, \u201cexperiments\u201d of this kind are called jackknifing. The flow of information in such modes and studies is influenced by input.txt. Normally, this file contains just a link (URL), or an html page, or natural language text extracted from a web page or, in the case of the present study, a query to the Wikipedia system. If it commences with an HTML DOCTYPE specification it is taken as a page in HTML, and if it starts with http:// or https:// it gets the required page in HTML. If it is the former and it contains signs that it is page in response to a query to Wikipedia, and that it has successfully found a relevant Wikipedia entry, then subroutine Xtract extracts the first reference to that entry. Further control as to specific sites can be exerted by changing a text variables called $HitList and $StartList. Normally, a link is memorized in $HitList, so that the link, and hence the corresponding web page, is only used once. If a query via the examination answer and topic relevance functions persistently fails on relevance tests it can be reset is to restart surfing from a list of URLs to start from, and judged by the end-user as likely to be productive, e.g. \u05f3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Pathology\u05f3.",

It contains the tags generated by the XTRACTOR component. It is normally this file that is read is read for each answer to each question in the examination. In the hybrid mode (ii), the PrK file, usually knowledge.txt, is copied to this file to initialize it, i.e. before it is extended by KRS element tags by the action of the XTRACTOR. In other words, it contain well curated PrK conent, and the rougher new XTRACT content extended progressively.(3)Curation is usually applied to a curated Knowledge File (CuK) curated.txt which is output as far as initial main runs are concerned, but becomes the input PrK in future runs, which therefore grows in a cyclic way. It arises because both on writing and reading the above XTRACT tags in the course of an examination, there is correction, repair and curation so that tags have correct canonical form, by methods described in Section 3.2.\n",

The basic counting required to evaluate the common content function is directly computed in this routine and is set to score +1 for field and word hits score as described in the Theory Section 2.4, but up to two additions of an adjustable bonus score taken as 10 in the present study as follows. However, in all cases below, any added score including bonus is negative if the tag being examined contains at least one negative relator filed, e.g. \u201cis not\u201d, \u201cdo not\u201d etc. Initially a tag is indicated to its general relevance as (a) whether or not it has a field in common with the question, and (b) whether or not it has a field in common with any one of the set of all answers for that question. In general, we say that A is a field in common with a field in B if it is the equivalent string, or one is the substring of the other, noting that an effort is made to place the field in a standard canonical format, removing determiners and trivial noun phrase words, and finally regularizing whitespace. If a field of a tag is found in the question it scores a 1 for a particular candidate answer if there is a common field with that candidate answer or with the last tag that had a field in common with that candidate answer. If a field of a tag is found in a candidate answer it scores a further 1 if there is a common field with the question or with the last tag that had a field in common with the question. If a tag is found to have a field in common with the question and also a field that is in common with a specific candidate answer, it scores the additional bonus (here, 10). It will score a second bonus (again, here 10) both (a) and (b) above were satisfied. Recall that the score are actually estimates of (positive or negative) mutual information and are all added prior to deducing the probability as an exponential of information, followed by normalization of probabilities of all answers so that the sum to 1.

PopperTidy is a simple automatic curation always called when knowledge representation tags are read in to insure they are not severely corrupted and adhere sufficiently to canonical form to be used by the internal working of GetCrudekNowledgePrior (see above). PopperTidy is adequate for use of curated tags already curated via POPPER. It also does basics such as recognizing probability assignment statements in POPPER language code [22], and re-express them as Pfwd and Pbwd attributes as the format preferred in MARPLE KRS elements. OpenPopper calls POPPER [22] for automatic curation by metastatements [22] but POPPER HELPER [22] can intercept for manual curation as well as creation of new metastatements. OpenPopperHelper calls POPPER HELPER directly, but that is primarily for manual curation, although it does contain contain some automated support tools such that manual component is helped or minimized [22]. Xtractor essentially calls XTRACTOR [27] to search the Internet, but XTRACTOR itself does the preliminary curation that allows XTRACTs to be used directly, and Xtractor in MARPLE does some further checking tidying. The results remain XTRACTs. In contrast, XtractTidy now automatically curates all tags found to \u201cwell curated KRS element\u201d As XtractTidy is general its name is somewhat a misnomer, but its most dramatic effect is on XTRACTs to STs and LSMs. It is the more sophisticated and slower curation routine that is applied to XTRACTs in the KRS at longer intervals in curation cycles, and so it does not typically act on XTRACTs just extracted. It will reject tags from use if they cannot be fully understood or repaired. VerifyField verifies that a field, such as a noun of verb phrase, is correctly constructed. It is used to help curate XTRACT tags. VerifyOption verifies that an answer option is correctly constructed and can extract essential content that can be used as a query, but it is also now applied to curate strings that are noun phrase and relationship phrases in XTRACTs. ValueToHighNormalLow converts clinical values to standard high, normal, and low ranges. It can be used to help curate both XTRACT and POPPER tags in that respect. NotNegated establishes that a relation is at least assured not to be of negative form, such as \u201cis not\u201d. It can used to help curate XTRACT as well as POPPER tags. Detrivialize curates a relationship field to contain only important words. While \u201cnot\u201d is highly significant, nominators presnt and words like \u201csomewhat\u201d etc. are not.

We now find that about 30% of questions are definitional in the sense of requiring just one knowledge element between question and answer, and 65% clearly two, but that really depends on the run because it is possible to make the connection with one link, or more, depending on what is available.

We consider the knowledge elements to be well curated as far as MARPLE and the exam is concerned. In the last run at the time of writing, the above100% was obtained using 2435 well curated KRS elements with, and without, previously obtained XTRACTs, and with, or without, new XTRACTs obtained by surfing the Internet during the exam, e.g. 11,500 XTRACTs in the last run. In that particular run the number of well curated KRS elements is about 12-13 on average per question and when Internet searching is allowed in addition, the number of XTRACTs is on average about 60 per question. The 12-13 is notably close to the average number of answers per question (13), but in a few cases just one may answer a question, and averaged over some 50 runs in the recent past required a minimum average of 16 per question. However, in some runs some questions appear more recalcitrant for no immediately obvious reason that is intrinsic to the question, and an average of 122 well curated elements per question has been needed to guarantee that exactly 100% is always obtained. The actual results will depend on the number of XTRACTs obtained and hence on the duration of Internet searching. In normal operation, indefinite time is allowed to gather knowledge, and the limiting factor is either when the questions so far are all answered correctly, or because overall performance makes worse the \u201cnoise\u201d as a consequence of too many elements and inability of curation to keep up as discussed in more detail in Section 1.6 and Section 5, but for example, 7,200,000 XTRACTs drops the 100% to 65%. For purposes of discussing exam performance as a kind of \u201cexercise in AI\u201d, 30 seconds \u201csurfing\u201d is allowed to consider each candidate answer, comparable to an exam for a human student, typically of 50 questions each of 5 answers to be answered in about one hour. See Section 4.3 for an overview of \u201ctiming\u201d benchmarks and how they relate to XTRACTs. Noise is still seen as arising mainly from XTRACTs because 96% to 100% is obtained if approximately 1 million well curated (or at least better curated) legacy knowledge elements from clinical data mining (Section 3.1) are included on the KRS. The set of 2435 well curated elements used to obtain 100% at the time of writing appears fairly typical in the character of the elements and the number of them, and appear to be close to a minimal set required because of the following preliminary results. The \u201ccomputer experiment\u201d of removing some elements at random to produce a reduced set of 2000 drops the score to 90%, and to 1000 gives 55%. Removing all content from the KRS, i.e. well curated KRS elements plus XTRACTs, gives 8% which is essentially what is expected on a random basis given an average of 13 candidate answers per question. If MARPLE 2 is then allowed to search the Internet during the exam, then 40% is obtained. Note that in this case the only sources of knowledge are the freshly obtained rougher XTRACTs, as yet without fuller curation.",

Curation Studies are really best considered as relating to performance after extensive good curation has been applied, while \u201cBlind Studies\u201d are in practice the same but with performance recorded at the moment that a new question is introduced. Blind Studies are also those in which emphasis is put on testing the \u201csmartness\u201d or otherwise of MARPLE, done by somehow setting the \"test\" questions apart from the set of \"development\" questions. That is, the questions previously used in learning are removed from training set for each relevant question. Under those conditions, an exam score of 73% is obtained. That is, providing the Internet can be searched. Recall that we consider that fair because it is the ability to use the use the Internet as a \u201cmemory extension\u201d when needed allows MARPLE to run on a standard personal computer. The precise meaning of this result should be explained, due to the number of possible ways, all fair tests, by which it could have been achieved (e.g. the learning machine approach in Ref. [20]). So that we can work with a stable fixed set of questions for the purposes of the present paper, we used jackknifing in the present study. One question is taken out at a time and the system is retrained in its absence, and then that question is placed back into the exam and tested as if seen for the first time. Many changes in conditions can affect the score. The above 73% is more precisely a specific if typical last run at the time of writing, using 1641 well curated KRS elements plus 14,612 new XTRACTs gathered from the Internet during the exam, and no older XTRACTs. This kind of result is only slightly more sensitive to minor variations as discussed for Curation Studies, although in earlier studies with fewer questions and fresh Internet search for each exam variously 55%-86% was obtained in otherwise similar conditions (there was a negative skew and a mode at about 77%). The fall from well curated KRS elements was in this case from the above 2435 of the Curation Studies to 1641, because we removed those \u201cwell curated KRS elements\u201d that arose by the curation of XTRACTs obtained from the Internet in earlier response to each question that is removed.",

We call this strong jackknifing, since is rather like the medical student who neglected to study the topic that came up, and has no way, during the exam, to get the knowledge needed. There is not an obvious common code that is transferable form one topic to another, as there can be in some prediction problems [20]. However, it is a fuller curation of XTRACTs that ultimately produces most of the well curated KRS elements that are present, and indeed the above has recently increased to 47% with ongoing curation of the XTRACTs. Clearly some relevant knowledge has been got, but this is essentially unsupervised learning that has picked up relevant information, but not by being directed to it by MARPLE in tackling a question. Earlier, when repeating with slightly varying conditions we obtained an average with a mean of 45% and standard deviation of about 10%, indicating more sensitivity dependent on the number and relevance of the KRS elements. Conversely, if all KRS elements are removed, and only the XTRACTs newly found in the exam are allowed, the 73% drops to 40%, the result that was already quoted at the end of Section 4.2.1 on \u201cCuration Studies\u201d.

For conditions of the first row of the Table, using an older Dell Vostro 320, MARPLE tacked questions correctly at a rate of 1.65 seconds per question, and 0.2 to 1.2 seconds per question on a variety of other personal computers. A very large piece of text rendered as a question, say 1-3 standard pages of text from the start of a published case study report, takes about 3 seconds. There is no well-defined distinction as yet between the time required to give the correct answer and the time taken when giving an incorrect answer when only well curated KRS elements are used, rather than Internet searching which along with curation is the slowest component function at present. When not in Popper mode, which applies to all rows below the first except the last, Internet searching is allowed (and obligated) and can take 2-3 minutes a question, of which about half is due to practical Internet access rate issues and half to the above basic degree of automatic curation. As of recently in this study, some 50,000 XTRACT tags can be readily be assembled and subject to some limited degree of automatic levels of curation in about an hour, and in practice roughly 20,000 such new tags can so be generated in a typical exam. One can potentially obtain some 1,200,000 XTRACTs per day allowing or forcing MARPLE to continuously search the Internet, but that number can vary considerably for two main reasons. First, on some occasions, a new questions can prove more troublesome and may take about 3-4 attempts before suitable XTRACTs or KRS elements curated from them are found, and these 3-4 attempts are together typically associated with generating some 60,000 tags taking about 15 minutes per question in very troublesome cases. In very incalcitrant cases a search might precede for an hour to answer a question, but that introduces a practical limit because at around 180,000 XTRACTs the score with jackknifing starts to fall from 73% to 71% and then continues to deteriorate. Straightforward learning without jackknifing, however, requires about 700,000 XTRACTs to fall to a similar score. Note that continued searching even if exam performance deteriorates still produces XTRACTs that can be put aside for later curation. Second, there are always practical considerations for time of day, location, and trace route. Notably, pinging Wikipedia in studies performed from a domestic residence in the Cayman Islands is not always so fast and significantly slower than pinging Google, on average some 200ms per packet response compared with 20ms for Google.",

Of greater concern from an automated curation perspective is that without jackknifing the performance of 100% with based on at least 2435 well curated KRS elements, and 0 to 11,500 XTRACTs based on at least 2435 well curated KRS elements, falls to 90% at about 14,000-15,000 XTRACTs, and to 80% at 173,200 XTRACT tags. This value has persisted at time of first writing for several million XTRACTs, but recently fell to score of 66% when using 7,200,000 XTRACTs, beyond which now appears to be stable. These recent results seem fairly typical in reruns with minor variations. The finer information-theoretic implications of this are still unclear and require further \u201cexperiments\u201d, but in drilling down to identify XTRACTs that appear responsible for forcing wrong answers, some 20% of the problematic statements that were not explicitly negative have so far been found to be negative or low probability by implication or context. For example, XTRACTOR and MARPLE at the present time will still inevitably have trouble with constructions like \u201cContrary to the evidence accumulated since the late seventeenth century, it was long believed that vision with one eye was superior to that with two\u201d. If KRS element tags representing negative statements are discarded from the curated KRS, the exam performance falls to 56%, so determiners are important through curation when a relationship is of a negative nature. Preliminary work has been in assigning words or phrases such as \u201cvery few\u201d as negative, and in general using an extension of the determiners associated with negative information as shown in the screenshot of POPER HELPER in Fig. 1 of Ref. [22]. The direct beneficial effect is on noise. At 7,200,000 XTRACTS the noise effect previously led to 50% exam score even in the absence of jackknifing, but rose to 65% with the above greater care over negatives. Intrinsic probabilities can be taken into account by multiplication with contextual probabilities; the finding is that any reasonable implementation has little effect on exam performance except for negative forms, i.e. providing that reasonable values reflecting the positive and negative sense of a statement were assigned. Paying attention to purely positive qualifiers and ensuring that such forms result in positive statements, has improved exam scores when \u201cnoise\u201d is present from many extracts. However it is only by a modest circa 2% on average. Drilldown to identify difficulties encountered with intrinsic probabilities and estimates of them based on determiners shows that better treatment is required in expressing relationships using intrinsic probabilities based on scope. For example, that no Americans have eye cancer would seem a good approximation of the probability 0.000008 based on prevalence, and injudicious use of such knowledge in inference risks eliminating such a diagnosis as ever being possible in the exam context where contextual probabilities dominate and \u201clife is relatively simple\u201d, i.e. of a more binary nature.",

Contrary evidence is important, and at first we suspected that this was due to better managing the noise arising from use many XTRACTs, because the structure of the formula was designed to focus on cases of more extensive data and focusing on the balance of evidence from it. Indeed, deleting all negative well curated KRS elements (e.g., containing relationships such as \u201cis not associated with\u201d), with 7,200,000 XTRACTs, recently dropped the score from 66% to 56%. Instead, simplifying the common content function by dropping the last two terms gave a similar 55%. Keeping the last two terms but dropping the prior frequency used in the zeta function to 10 or less gave 50%. However, in the first two cases, similar final values are obtained even when dramatically decreasing the number of XTRACTs, suggesting that a very significant effect is on the well curated KRS. In contrast, using a prior of more than 10 uniformly for the prior frequencies in the zeta function had relatively little effect on exam performance when no XTRACTs were used, suggesting that the choice of prior frequency, without other changes, has an important role in damping the \u201cnoise\u2019 from many XTACTs. Somewhat surprisingly, without jackknifing for 2310 well curated elements and 7,200,000 XTRACTs, dropping the last two common word terms from the common content function and dropping prior frequency in zeta function to 10 or less at the same time dropped the exam score to 24%. There appears to be some clue to this in the result of 24% that is also obtained with all well curated KRS elements removed and deleting XTRACTs containing significant words (primarily meaning other than determiners \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201csome\u201d etc.) that are found in both the question and answer set. This involved 6,110,433 XTRACTs, the drop in number being due to the above deletions. While some findings still beg detailed explanation, all this would seem to confirm that the full form of the common content equation combined with a strong damping effect from a uniform prior frequency is generally important.",

This is most easily policed by only allowing ourselves to curate elements of knowledge that show up as XTRACTs or preexisted in the Q-UEL system prior to use of the current exam set, except in the most recalcitrant cases (see below). We would estimate from \u201ccomputer experiments\u201d that some 25% of new questions required some unusually high degree of attention to refinement of existing KRS element tags and importantly there was in those cases usually the need to include others with more radical modifications that might suggest a degree of forcing. This represented 40% of cases that have separate questions but an answer set in common (See Section 5.2). The above \u201crecalcitrant cases\u201d are extreme or controversial examples, about 6% of cases. This is being reappraised, however, because it is now noted that many corresponded to introduction of negative statements such as < X | \u2018is not associated with\u2019 | Y> to ensure that wrong answers Y are avoided, and this turned out not to have as much impact of scores as might be expected (see Section 5.2). It is, of course, a well justified inclusion if X is indeed not associated with Y in real world medicine, which is the ultimate whole point of curation. This normally turns out to be the case because the exam questions typically thoughtfully and fairly constructed by their authors, and reflect real world medicine. When curation does look like forcing, it most often naturally arises in those cases in which the exam question is not correct, or more likely misleading or ambiguous. Examiners preparing questions in the style of licensing examinations, and medical licensing boards, can appear to adopt definitions and classifications that are to some degree consensus in their community but nonetheless reflect an arbitrary rather than fundamental justification.

Depending on how one views it, the following, as a means of resolving that, is either an aspect of curation or an easy way of greatly reducing the need for curation, although paradoxically it requires increasing the number of \u201craw\u201d XTRACTs in a particular way. Note first that to human inspection, some 40% of XTRACT tags seem already to be already in adequate usable form by MARPLE without further curation, certainly at least as far as the rather tolerant common content function is concerned. Unfortunately, some 10%-20% of the remaining 60% of XTRACT tags have some kind of errors that appear of sufficient severity to yield noise and reduce overall performance dramatically. These include parsing ambiguities and misinterpretation of the role of words. As far as Q-UEL\u2019s THESAURUS that helps XTRACT curation indicates that some 500-600 common words in English may have 20-30 different meanings with different probabilities calculable a priori\n[26]. Nonetheless, there is significant preliminary evidence, from studies on smaller sets of tags as follows, that the bad effect of increasing the number of XTRACT tags is greatly diminished if different text sources are used that express the same knowledge content in somewhat different ways. In that case, many different XTRACTs are produced of essentially same knowledge content that paraphrase each other. It is not hard to do that in practice, because in some instances it occurs naturally on the Web. It does however demand that XTRACTs are being generated over many years.

It is not sufficient, not least because intrinsic probabilities are not well tested, except as binary degrees of truth represented by positive and negative statements. As to being a success in AI, it emerges that passing medical exams is not as much an AI challenge as one may think. It continues to looks as if medical licensing examinations are set up so that a student taking the examination can reason as follows: \u201cThe question has a part that has something to do with part of one of my knowledge elements, and part of that knowledge element has something to do with part of one of my other knowledge elements, which has a part that has something to do with one of the answers.

Early recognition of this has been widely attributed to a statement by Edward Feigenbaum and subsequently called the Feigenbaum Bottleneck\n[42]. While we feel bound to continue auditing experts of KRS elements by human with CDS applications in real clinical settings in mind, escalating numbers of XTRACTS in particular are making routine manual intervention increasingly impractical. Any automation of curation processes is important. There are a number of ways that a knowledge representation may be wrong, and hence a number of ways to correct it. Some are easier to automate than others. Readily automated were simple detection and correction of obvious canonical structure errors, and the characteristic content of noun and relationship phrases about to be laced in the wrong \u201cslots\u201d of STs and LSMs. The POPPER HELPER interface [22] facilitates the progressive transformation from human expertise capture to its replacement by automation, so that this evolves at the same time as the KRS is growing. This is easy to do by constructing metastatements that act on statements as KRS elements [22], but steps that are essentially curation are being added directly to the code of MARPLE on an ongoing basis. All these approaches were used in the later of studies reported above. A recent implementation in MARPLE 2 which resulted in the later results reported above was automatic creation of negative statements to provide appropriate evidence against incorrect candidate answers appears important, and is readily automated. That is to say, statements like < X | \u2018is not associated with\u2019 | Y > are important, and effectively eliminate Y as an answer, but therefore needs to be verified that this is medically the case to avoiding forcing correct answers that will damage performance in later questions on similar topics. It is not as yet applied to XTRACTs, but only in their processing to become well curated KRS elements. Note that we are increasingly making use of multiple questions sharing the same answer sets [35], when sometimes the same answer is the case and more commonly not, so the common content function will tend to increase specificity and weight contributions naturally without much need for human intervention (except for ongoing checks). Probably because of use of such questions, and because MARPLE was already working will a well curated core set of KRS elements, this implementation has only minor effect in the present study. Results are not significantly changed by removing this feature. However we expect it to become important in the future as a large number of more recently acquired XTRACTs are progressively further curated. Studies on these curation aspects and others will be reported elsewhere.",

The challenge is conversion to a specific value in Pfwd and Pbwd attribute values, though note that Q-UEL allows e.g. Pfwd:=0.85+/-0.05, standard deviations etc., and other qualifications of certainty, as it does for any attribute values [23], [27]. Some aspects of our current theoretical thinking on determiners are indicated elsewhere [22], [41]. These Pfwd and Pbwd values are, however, precisely the same intrinsic probabilities that we have shown to be less important in the present exam context, except for taking account of negation, so the minor role of determiners in exams seems less surprising in hindsight.",

MARPLE can gather 106 XTRACT tags per day from the Internet, and their curation, now the main focus of current efforts, is improving rapidly. With well curated KRS elements, each question in an exam takes the order of a second to answer. An average human medical student may study privately about 500-600 total hours for the USMLE Step 1 and spend 3000-5000 hours overall including lectures and practical classes, and a real comprehensive medical licensing examination can take 4 or 8 hours involving perhaps 200 multiple choice questions each with just 5 answers. In contrast, the TV quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d, is specifically an interactive competition against humans, and winning is based on the total amount of money won, which is based on wagers by participants that the answer given would be correct. On that basis, Watson was a clear winner. However, Watson only answered 50% of all questions in Round 1, 77% in Round 2, and 0% in the short final according to Ref. [12]. That gives 44% questions answered in this quiz game interpreted as an exam, overall, in which those that are not attempted are counted as fails.",

            "text": "As to the quality that in the long term may be or may not be achievable in quizzes and examinations, and not least in medical decision making, some closing comment might be made in the light of the movie \u201cSlum Dog Millionaire\u201d [43], said to be based in part on a true story. It suffices to state the plot itself, and to think of the possible implications for applying the celebrated Turing Test [44] in such situations, replacing Jamal Malik, the hero of the movie, by a computer system. In the movie, Jamil is one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India\u05f3s Kaun Banega Crorepati? (2000) (Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?), but that night, police arrest him. It is on suspicion of cheating: he is an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai. How could such a person have so much wisdom and knowledge? To prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life and how it provided key knowledge and wisdom in stages that could be used to provide the answer to one of the game show\u05f3s seemingly impossible questions. It would seem hard for a computer to pass a quiz or exam if so much depends on subtle human experience. However, while we can live complicated lives, and present a challenge for a guru, spiritual guide, counselor, or even psychiatrist, most of us usually get physically sick in a relatively limited number of ways, as \u201ccase\u201d types that allow a physician, and hopefully future CDSS, to function effectively.",
