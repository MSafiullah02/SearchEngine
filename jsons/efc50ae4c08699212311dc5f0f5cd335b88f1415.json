This interaction between smoking and ICS use deserves further exploration, since ICSs may affect RV-induced illness by restitution of the airway epithelium, as well as modification of host response to virus, and this may be different for smokers and nonsmokers. Tobacco cessation may have an even more important role in modifying the outcome of RV infection among persons with asthma.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "There are several potential limitations of this study to consider. First, the study is relatively small and was conducted at a single university medical center, and our findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Other studies have detected higher RV infection prevalences during acute adult asthma exacerbations; however, one other study that used nasal specimens yielded an RV prevalence similar to that in our study, suggesting that the relatively higher rates of viral detection in those investigations may be explained by potential differences in detection rates between nasal and sputum specimens [43] . However, because we used the same methodology to compare patients at both time points, the conclusions drawn should be valid. In addition, we were only able to obtain convalescent specimens from 75% of study patients, including 12 who were RV positive at hospital admission. Although there were no significant differences in general demographic characteristics between study patients who did and those who did not follow-up that would suggest that RV infection rates may be differential, because study patients who did not return for follow-up were more likely to smoke and because smoking appeared to be a characteristic of those with RV infection, convalescent-phase RV infection prev-alence could have been underestimated. The prevalence of RV infection at the convalescent follow-up visit (1.3%) was lower than that previously reported for asymptomatic populations, and the single individual in this study in whom it was detected at follow-up had symptoms of a respiratory infection and significantly exacerbated asthma. Previous reports of RV detection in asymptomatic individuals have varied from 10% to 12% in subjects with asthma and from 4% to 35% in subjects without asthma, with studies varying in the length of time that subjects had no upper respiratory tract symptoms preceding sample collection [3, 4, 8, 22] . Three of these studies, however, were performed in children with asthma, and a recent study by Jartti et al. revealed that, after the onset of symptomatic respiratory infection, RV RNA may take 5-6 weeks to disappear from the nasopharynx of children admitted with acute respiratory wheezing [44] . Lastly, the etiology of exacerbations in the RV-negative group was not determined, but a large proportion were almost certainly caused by other respiratory viruses, as evidenced by a high prevalence of upper respiratory tract symptoms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 615, "end": 619, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1935, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1936, "end": 1938, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1941, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1945, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2243, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, these data confirm that RV respiratory infection is an etiologic factor for severe asthma exacerbations necessitating hospitalization, and patients with RV infection appear to have unique characteristics, including current smoking and nonuse of ICSs. The role of smoking and ICSs in host susceptibility to viral infection in asthma deserves further exploration, since this has significant implications for indications for ICS use and in decreasing severe asthma exacerbations and disease morbidity. The finding that 21% of hospitalizations for severe asthma are associated with RV positivity can be considered significant, in view of the lack of licensed antivirals for RV and the unlikelihood, because of multiple serotypes, of a vaccine being developed. The importance of RV infection in this setting illustrates the need for further research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0",
