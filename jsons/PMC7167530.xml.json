            "text": "Since the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV-2) infection in Hubei in December 2019, SARS\u2013CoV-2 has spread throughout China and worldwide.1 The population is generally susceptible, and elderly individuals and those with underlying diseases are more likely to present with severe disease.1,2 The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS\u2013CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern and raised the global risk level to the highest level. By 15 April, 2020, 1,878,489 confirmed cases had been reported in more than 200 countries, resulting in 119,044 deaths. The worldwide epidemic of SARS\u2013CoV-2 may be a once-in-a-century pandemic,3 so how to deal with the epidemic and protect public health is the first priority. Patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection and are more likely to have severe events due to the immunosuppressive state caused by cancer itself and anticancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.4 Indeed, Wenhua Liang and his colleagues found that the incidence of COVID-19 patients with a history of cancer was higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall Chinese population, and that patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events than other patients.5 Therefore, it is a matter of great concern for every patient and medical staff member to co-ordinate epidemic control and cancer treatment during the epidemic period. Considering the characteristics of SARS\u2013CoV-2 transmission and the requirements for prevention and control of COVID-19 by relevant departments, this paper proposes strategies for cancer diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic that can provide information for SARS\u2013CoV-2 prevention and control, reduce the impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnosis and treatment and ensure the continuity of treatment.",

Regardless of whether tumours are benign or malignant, if there is rapid progress, severe organ function impairment or a life-threatening situation, such as rupture and haemorrhage of the tumour or severe compression caused by a large tumour, an emergency operation should be considered. A confined operation should be comprehensively evaluated and reasonably arranged according to the local epidemic and hospital situation. Tumour resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be completed in as reasonable an interval as possible if all conditions permit. By contrast, a radical operation should be postponed until the end of the epidemic.",

The prognosis of patients is closely related to how to ensure the standardisation and continuity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy during the pandemic. After chemotherapy, the majority of patients will present with myelosuppression of varying degrees and durations, which will increase the risk of infection. Severe thrombocytopenia may lead to fatal bleeding, and the risk of the patient is even higher due to the blood shortage during the pandemic. Chemotherapy in local hospitals is preferred to reduce population migration. High-dose chemotherapy and other regimens with severe myelotoxicity should be avoided. Dose-reduction chemotherapy is an option if necessary. In some cases, oral chemotherapy is a feasible choice, especially for palliative treatment. Radiotherapy might cause myelosuppression and increase the risk of infection due to increased exposure. It is recommended that the radiotherapy be postponed if not necessary during the pandemic.",
