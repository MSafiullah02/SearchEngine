            "text": "We showed that a prompt point-prevalence survey by systematic nasopharyngeal RT-PCR for SARS- The very low positivity rate of systematic screening of nursing home staff after identification of a COVID-19 case in a resident might be explained by various factors. First, the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is 5 days, and transmission of the virus can occur in the 48 hours before symptom onset [2, 3] . There is therefore a theoretical window period of 3 days during which nasopharyngeal RT-PCR will be negative during the early incubation period, assuming that the transmission risk is correlated with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR [3] . Second, viral transmission during the incubation period varies between 6% and 44% of cases, which would diminish performances of one-time testing of asymptomatic individuals, even more so if such transmission rate is in the lower range [3] [4] [5] . Third, the survey was conducted four weeks after lockdown and strong decrease of new viral infections in our area, which could also explain the very low positivity rate of RT-PCR. Finally, nasopharyngeal RT-PCR has poor sensitivity, around 70% in symptomatic individuals. Sensitivity is unknown but probably even lower in asymptomatic infected individuals, especially during the incubation period [6] [7] [8] . In conclusion, our study suggests that human resources and cost for systematic screening of all staff members of a medicalized nursing home after diagnosing a first case of COVID-19 in a resident are totally disproportionate according to the limited effectiveness of such point-prevalence survey. Our large screening had limited or even no impact on viral transmission reduction. Whether testing of asymptomatic staff members in medicalized nursing homes should be proposed to better organize COVID-positive and COVID-free dedicated units, in case of large outbreaks, remains to be investigated [9] . A national policy for systematic point testing for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR of all staff members of medicalized nursing homes after identifying COVID-19 in a resident should be put on hold.",

Following notification of the case, all staff members were immediately offered SARS-CoV-2 testing as part of a point-prevalence survey. Nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests (Detection kit for 2019 novel coronavirus RNA, PCR Fluorescence Probing, Daan Gene Co.) were performed on April 16 and 17 in the COVID-19 ambulatory clinic. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and risk factors for severe COVID-19 were collected through a standardized symptomassessment form.",

Such results reinforce the policy of enhanced screening measures for minor symptoms in health care personnel, with immediate isolation and quarantine in case of RT-PCR positivity.Our study has limitations. The index case was diagnosed on chest CT-scan with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. One could argue that this resident did not have COVID-19, although CT-scan was typical, with no alternative diagnosis, and sensitivity of nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in the elderly with isolated pneumonia is low. In the current pandemic context associated with the critical situation in medicalized nursing homes and implementation of national guidelines, it would have been impossible perform the prompt and massive one-shot systematic testing of all staff members, even if entirely asymptomatic, following one case of high suspicion of COVID-19.",
