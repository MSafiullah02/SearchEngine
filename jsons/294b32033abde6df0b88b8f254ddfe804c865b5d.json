Although physicians commonly accept the history of a patient's underlying illness as valid, treatment for a disorder with potentially toxic agents should always require verification of the diagnosis. It could therefore be argued that the GP was remiss in instituting a cocktail of medications without having a confirmed copy of the test result for HIV infection. This is particularly damaging for an asymptomatic subject with no history of opportunistic infection or clinical evidence of AIDS complication.

The normal CD4 + T lymphocyte count usually averages 8.0-10.5 \u00c2 10 8 cells/L (800-1,050/mm 3 ), but the range of normality (2 standard deviations of the mean) is quite wide (500-1,400 cells/mm 3 ). 7 About 80% of the normal blood lymphocytes are T lymphocytes and nearly twothirds of blood T lymphocytes are CD4 + (helper) lymphocytes and most patients with lymphocytopenia have reduction in absolute number of CD4 + T lymphocytes. 8 There are many conditions that can be associated with lymphocytopenia and lower than normal CD4 + lymphocyte count. Although HIV infection is the most common viral infection associated with CD4 + lymphocytopenia, other viral infections can transiently decrease CD4 + cell counts (including measles, corona viruses and others). 8 The list of conditions associated with CD4 + lymphocytopenia (besides viral infections) include bacterial and fungal sepsis (including tuberculosis), major surgery, recent trauma or hemorrhage, malignancy, glucocorticoid use, cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, auto-immune diseases, nutritional deficiencies, organ transplantation, acquired common variable immunodeficiency, and idiopathic CD4 + lymphocytopenia. 8 Furthermore, it is common to observe biologic variations in the absolute CD4 + cell count even in HIV infected subjects without any other factors. A healthy adult may have, at some time, transient decrease in CD4 + cell count below 500. Whether the plaintiff's CD4 + cell count decline was due to viral upper respiratory tract infection or other causes was not clear. In HIV-infected patients, the T lymphocytes decline by 4% per year for every log 10 HIV RNA copies/mL in the plasma. 7 Currently, the optimal time to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) for asymptomatic HIV patients is not clear. There is consensus that patients with AIDS complications or symptomatic disease should be started on ART. There is still controversy as to the optimal time to initiate ART in asymptomatic patients. Some guidelines recommend considering starting ART below 350 cells/mm 3 and others recently <500 cells/mm 3 , but there are no randomized controlled trials to provide a clear answer.",

This is associated with a dramatic drop in circulating CD4 + lymphocytes, then a slowing of T-cell loss, and rebound by 9-12 weeks. This rebound of CD4 + cells corresponds to a decline in viral load, which reaches a steady state (set point), which is variable by 9-12 weeks. Clinical progression of HIV disease has been tied to a set point level with lower levels associated with better prognosis. 17 At 1 year after seroconversion, patients demonstrate a fall of about 349 CD4 + cells/mm 3 (mean baseline 999 cells/mm 3 ), followed by a more gradual decline in CD4 + cells in the later period of infection. 18 There is usually a variable period of 8-10 years span before patients develop AIDS (about 50%).

            "text": "Long-term non-progression or elite controllers represent <5% of HIV-infected subjects who maintain relatively normal CD4 + cell count and very low or immeasurable viral load for 8 years to decades without therapy. 19 This is a heterogenous group of elite controllers whose benign course may result from robust immune responses against HIV, or defective poorly replicative virus secondary to deletion of the nef gene. 20, 21 There is evidence that host factors that influence the course of HIV disease are correlated to polymorphisms dominating the HLA region, with class I polymorphism dominating the HLA associations. 22 There is also evidence from studies in the United States and Europe that HLA-B57 and HLA B-27 are strongly associated with long term survival or non-progression. 22 Not all long-term non-progressors are \"elite or viremic controllers\" (patients with undetectable HIV or plasma HIV RNA levels of 50-2,000 copies/mL). These patients with CD4 + cell counts of >500 cells/mm 3 for at least 10 years most often had HIV RNA levels of >2,000 copies/mL, but had significantly lower HIV RNA than subjects with typical progression. Thus plasma set point HIV RNA levels explain <50% of the variability in rates of clinical progression. 24 The chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) protein serves as a co-receptor on CD4 + lymphocytes for certain strains of HIV-1. Homozygosity for a 32-base pair deletion allele (CCR5D32) protects against HIV infection (1% of Caucasians) and heterozygosity (individuals with one allele) show a decreased progression to AIDS. 25 There is also evidence that co-infection with GB virus (GBV-C), a flavivirus not known to cause disease (in subjects with GBV-C viremia), have slower progression and slower decrease in CD4 + cell counts than those without GBV-C infection. 23 Although the reasons for this protective effect are unclear, there is evidence that GBV-C inhibits HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, and since GBV-C infects CD4 + cells, this may compete with the HIV for target cells for infection. 23 A minority of patients with HIV infection can rapidly progress to AIDS within 1-3 years of their infection. This may be related to host genetic factors and age at the time of infection and other extrinsic conditions. Older age at the time of infection (>25 years) has been associated with faster progression of the disease in hemophiliacs and older homosexuals. 23 Concomitant co-infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been associated with rapid progression to AIDS in hemophiliacs and others. 26, 27 Co-infection with HTLV-I may increase the risk for development of AIDS while HTLV-2 can delay the progression of disease. 23, 28, 29 Active tuberculosis can also enhance HIV replication and cause rapid progression to AIDS. 30 However, although treatment of active tuberculosis for 6 months is associated with increased CD4 + cell count, it does not markedly affect the HIV viral loads. 31 The role of hepatitis C-virus (HCV) co-infection on the progression of HIV disease has been conflicting, with some studies showing more rapid progression, but others have found no effect on the development of AIDS. 23 The clade or strain of HIV-1 may play a role in the course of the disease. Clade D of HIV-1 is associated with faster progression to death in Africa than Clade-A and B. 32 Women in Senegal infected with C, D or G HIV Clade were eight times more likely to develop AIDS than those infected with Clade A subtype (the predominant sub-type). 33 Infection with multiple strains of HIV-1 (more common in women) have also been associated with faster disease progression. 34 Socio-economic factors such as poverty, homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, and black race play indirect roles in the prognosis and disease progression of HIV infection, primarily through lower access to medical management, delay in instituting antiretrovirals and poorer compliance with medications. Although a previous study found that alcohol and psychoactive drugs did not accelerate HIV disease, 35 there is in vitro evidence that alcohol, cocaine and narcotics can impair the immune response to HIV-1 and allow enhanced replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 23 A case report of rapid progression to AIDS within a year of infection has also been attributed to alcoholism. 36 ",

However, by 1994 he had progressed to symptomatic AIDS. Thus, his course was more rapid than usual HIV infected individuals were, and especially as no other conditions or factors were recognized that could accelerate his course of disease. However, the failure of the FP to notify the patient of his HIV-positive status before recognition of his condition was only 1 year. Would an earlier diagnosis by 1 year and assuming institution of ART then, affected the outcome as to lifespan and quality of life? Appropriate treatment a year earlier with ART would likely have aborted or ameliorated his symptomatic disease, of weight loss, diarrhea, and malaise. However, it is less clear whether his expected lifespan would be any greater. If we assume that over the preceding year his CD4 + cell count probably declined by 50-100 cells/mm 3 , then even at that time he would have already progressed to AIDS (CD4 + cell count <200 cells/mm 3 ). There is reasonable good cumulated evidence that starting therapy when the CD4 + cell count is very low (<200 cells/ mm 3 ) is associated with less chance of immune reconstitution and greater risk of opportunistic complications than those started on ART when the CD4 + cell count was >200 cells/mm 3 . The optimum CD4 + cell count for initiating ART has not been well established although recent large observational cohort studies (retrospective and prospective ) and suggests better outcomes for HIV infected patients receiving earlier ART with CD4 + cell count !350 cells/mm 3 or >500 cells/mm 3 ; the data however is flawed and controversial. 37, 38 Lack of randomization in these studies could result in significant biases as motivated, health-conscious individuals would likely do better that those less motivated. It is not clear in these studies as to the cause of excess mortality in those not accepting treatment. For instance, it would be expected and predictable to find excess mortality (from any disease) in marginalized people (homeless, alcoholics, drug abusers), who are less likely to start ART, which may be unrelated to HIV complications, such as suicides, homicide, accidents, drug overdose, liver failure or other diseases more prevalent in these groups (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and cancer).",

It could be argued, however, that the FP should have been doing regular HIV serology in an individual that belongs to a high-risk group (with the patient's consent). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that nearly 50% of men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV infection are unaware of their status. The CDC National Behavior Surveillance System of high-risk venue-based recruitment found 25% of MSM tested to be infected with HIV, and nearly 50% of the HIV infected individuals were unaware of their infection. 39 In New York City, the HIV incidence rate among MSM was 2.3%, with 52% of those infected being unaware of their HIV seropositivity. 39 It is estimated that 21% of HIV-infected people in the US who are unaware of their infection may account for up to 52% of new infections. CDC HIV testing guidelines recommend annual testing for high-risk populations (including MSM), and since 2006 have recommended universal opt-out HIV screening in all health care settings. 40 Thus, the plaintiff could argue that the defendant fell below the standard of care by not recommending and performing annual HIV tests. Furthermore, if he were found to be HIV seropositive earlier, (by 1990 or before) with careful monitoring and institution of ART before his CD4 + cell count fell <350 cells/mm 3 , his quality of life and life expectancy would be greater. 41 What is the effect of life expectancy with late treatment initiation for HIV disease? In a recent study using a state-transition model of HIV disease, the projected life expectancy of HIV uninfected and HIV infected persons with similar risk profiles were compared. 41 Those with HIV infection lost 11.92 years of life if they received care concordant with guidelines and late treatment initiation resulted in 2.60 additional years of life lost (greatest for Hispanics [3.90 years]). 41 ",

He was admitted as possible PCP under the care of the ID physician, but no eye examination was performed. A week after his admission to hospital, a neurologist who was consulted found very poor vision with light perception only in the right eye and finger counting on the left eye. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral chorioretinitis and ophthalmology consultation was requested, but treatment of CMV retinitis was only instituted 2 days later. His course was complicated by retinal detachment secondary to CMV retinitis with almost complete blindness in the right eye and severe visual impairment of the left eye -legally blind.",

            "text": "The most dreaded ocular complications of AIDS were from opportunistic ocular infections (CMV retinitis, herpes zoster (VZV) retinitis, or herpes zoster ophthalmicus, toxoplasma retinitis and ocular syphilis), or neoplasm (Kaposi sarcoma of the lids and conjunctivae, and orbital or intraorbital lymphoma). 42 CMV retinitis is the most frequent sight threatening ocular complication of AIDS, occurring in the late stages when the CD4 + lymphocyte counts <50 cells/mL. In the pre-HAART era CMV retinitis occurred in 30% of patients with AIDS, and the number of new cases has dramatically fallen since widespread use of HAART by 55-95% (average 80%). 42 The incidence of CMV retinitis among patients with CD4 + cell count <100 cells/mL was 10% per year and for many patients with CD4 + cell count <50 cells/mL, it was 20% per year. Symptoms of CMV retinitis include floaters, flashing lights, loss of visual field, or visual loss. In the early stages with small peripheral retinal lesions patients can be asymptomatic and 13-15% of persons with CD4 + cell count 50 cells/mL have asymptomatic CMV retinitis. 43 Lesions adjacent to the optic nerve or fovea (posterior pole of the retina or macula) are immediately vision threatening. The retina has been divided into three zones for clinical assessment of risk to vision. Zone 1 lies within 1,500 mm from the edge of the optic nerve, zone 2 extends from the edge of zone 1 to the equator of the eye, and zone 3 extends from the equator to the pars plana (pigmented posterior zone of the ciliary body). See Fig. 13 .1 for the schematic diagram of the zones of the retina. Lesions of zone 1 are immediately sight-threatening and require urgent treatment, whereas lesions of zones 2-3 may be observed for short periods of time without risk of loss of visual acuity. 42 The mean time for progression of peripheral lesions without treatment was found to be 22 days (enlargement to uninvolved retina by !750 mm in width). 44 The complications of untreated or delayed treatment of CMV retinitis include impaired vision to blindness, secondary to progressive retinitis with hemorrhages, scarring and retinal detachment. In the pre-HAART era, retinal detachment in CMV retinitis occurred in 25% at 6 months and in 50-60% at 1 year. 42 The diagnosis of CMV retinitis can be made reliably by an experienced ophthalmologist by dilated direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy. Examination of the fundus through an undilated pupil is inadequate to diagnose or exclude CMV retinitis as only 10% of the retina can be evaluated. 42 The aim of treatment with anti-CMV drugs (ganciclovir intravenously or oral valganciclovir) is to arrest progression of the disease, prevent further spread, and preserve vision. Treatment with anti-CMV agents does not eradicate the virus but delays progression and relapse, until immunity can be restored by HAART. Anti-CMV therapy, half the dose after induction for 3 weeks, can be discontinued once the CD4 + cell count is >100-150 cells/mL for 6 months. Some experts advocate intravitreal injection or ganciclovir implant in addition to systemic therapy for zone 1 CMV retinitis to avoid loss of vision. 42 ",

The results could be forwarded to the FP and notify him or her of the patient's cancelation plus need for counseling, close monitoring, and for initiating ART or PCP prophylaxis depending on the CD4 + cell count. If the subject has no FP, then the person can be notified of the results by letter or phone, or through the public health department. Although some physicians are reluctant to discuss confidential issues on the phone, there is no edict against this practice. However, confidentiality needs to be maintained and the identification of the person on the phone should be verified. This has become a common practice with financial institutions and even lawyers who discuss medicolegal cases with medical experts on the phone. Since the defendant knew the plaintiff had advanced HIV disease (AIDS) as indicated by the very low CD4 + cell count, it was mandatory that the patient be made aware of the seriousness of his condition as soon as possible by one of the above mechanisms.
