            "text": "Becoming a professionally qualified engineer is not easy-it requires the kind of hard work and dedication that generates self-respect. Almost all engineers I know are modestly proud of what they have achieved. When you have been part of the designing and making of a challenging project you have great satisfaction when you see the finished product. To be working on a bridge as part of it collapses is devastating and something that stays with you for the rest of your life. Recovery depends on a strength of character that goes beyond the ordinary. But personal trauma need not stand in the way of success. Psychologists Feldman and Kravetz 2 have noted this in people who have an accident, receive a devastating medical diagnosis, lose a loved one or live in a country where war and famine are almost routine. They identified five factors that seem to help people: hope, personal control, social support, forgiveness and spirituality. They write 'truly accepting the consequences of a trauma with realistic thinking rather than delusional positive thinking can open people up to true hope something that enables setting and achieving goals that ultimately can improve one's life\u2026.A realistic view of the situation + a strong view of one's ability to control one's destiny through one's efforts = grounded hope ' .",

            "text": "Flourishing is about achieving your potential-individually and collectively despite obstacles and setbacks. The word stems from the Latin florere 'to bloom, blossom, and flower'. Aristotle was the first to understand its importance. He saw that flourishing occurs when we want to do what we ought to do-take pleasure in moral action. He thought that earthly happiness is a by-product of using our individual capacities to realise our potential. In that sense what really matters is not what we believe but how we behave. Karen Armstrong 3 calls the religious emphasis on belief as determining action, a metaphysical mistake and an accident of history. Acting by creating imparts feelings of achievement. As we noted in Chap. 2 personal hobbies like gardening, drawing, craftwork or simply just repair jobs around the home can be very satisfying. Throughout history we have built big cathedrals, mosques, churches and temples as expressions of communal faith. Experiencing those spaces often creates feelings of high spirituality. Sports stadia like Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, exhibition halls and museums like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, large-scale art works such as the i360 tower in Brighton opened in 2016 ( Fig. 9 .1) and the colossal Cornish Man Engine 4 ( Fig. 9 .2) are all artistic expressions that embody the conscious use of the imagination.",

            "text": "Given the complex challenges we are facing in the twenty-first century, we can learn a lot about our collective future from the advice from Feldman and Kravetz and the experiences of those who live through personal trauma such as the West Gate Bridge collapse. In order to flourish together, we need to maintain hope, take collective control, support each other, live with a spirit of forgiveness that unites rather than divides us and develop a sense of spirituality that goes beyond conventional religion. The five principles of Part, Unintended, Preparedness, Ingenuity and Learning are key ingredients. When we truly understand ourselves as Part of the natural world then we have hope for a better future. When we admit our tendency for technical triumphalism-past arrogance in thinking that we are in total control of the natural world then we are ready to accept unforeseen and Unintended consequences and unknown unknowns. When we recognise that Preparedness for an uncertain future is by developing communities that integrate rather than divide us with a sense of overall common purpose. When we accept that the golden rule of all religions is 'Don't do to others that you would not have them do to you' then we have a key to spirituality. Again, this rule emphasises that the way we act leads to the way we believe rather than, as most religions now teach, belief determines how we should behave. We should be using all of our considerable ingenuity to find new ways of living to learn how to be resilient when an unknown becomes a known-for example, an unforeseen consequence (an unknown) of climate change hits us (becomes known). Christopher's story started with an offer to work in the company that Sir Ralph Freeman senior had created. Freeman had been one of the most eminent engineers of his day-for example, he designed the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932) in Australia. His son, also Ralph Freeman (and also knighted for his services to engineering) joined the business after the war and was made a partner in 1947. He had pre-war experience of bridge design and construction in Africa and worked on the 3.2 km steel girder road and rail Storstr\u00f8m Bridge in Denmark. He served with distinction in the war as chief engineer to 21 Army Group and was responsible for military bridges in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. Freeman junior took over as senior partner at Freeman Fox in 1963, a position he held until he retired in 1979. Freeman Fox and Partners were in the early 1970s without doubt the top bridge designers in the world. They were responsible for the Forth Road Bridge, the Severn and Wye Bridges, the Erskine Bridge and both Bosphorus Bridges in Turkey. Freeman's other most notable partners were Sir Gilbert Roberts, Oleg Kerensky and Bill Brown. Roberts and Brown were responsible for the design of the West Gate Bridge. They had previously developed new design concepts including suspension and cable-stayed bridge decks with a stable aero-foil-shaped cross section, box girders with stiffened steel decks, new methods for spinning of cable wires and a new cable configuration.",

He was then seconded in 1970 to the contractor Fairfield-Mabey working in Scotland on the Erskine Bridge, and responsible for the construction of the south side. One day he had an urgent phone call asking him to go straightaway to Australia to work on the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. A new contractor, John Holland Pty, had been appointed by the Bridge Authority. Although the company had a high reputation, it had no experience of the construction of long-span steel bridges. The contractual position had become unclear with no definition of responsibilities of the respective parties. Christopher was given the responsibility for the construction of the bridge on the east side of the river.",

Unfortunately, Bill was one of the 40 people killed. The other engineers who lost their lives and had worked closely with Christopher were Jack Hindshaw and Peter Crossley. Jack was the Resident Engineer. His role was to represent the designer on site-on behalf of the clientand to make sure that the contractor carried out the work as required. Jack had only been in Australia for a relatively short time after replacing the previous resident engineer. Christopher recalls that Jack was small in stature but very likeable with a strong Lancastrian accent. Christopher had worked in the London Office with Peter Crossley.

They had many difficulties with the trades union and eventually the company was dismissed from the contract by the Bridge Authority. As well as the problems at West Gate, Freeman Fox also had to cope with the collapse of their Milford Haven Bridge in Pembroke in Wales in 1970. That bridge differed from West Gate in that it was an all steel structure and was being erected by cantilevering out from a pier. Lengths of the full cross section of the box were welded on the end of a growing cantilever until the total length reached and rested on the next pier. The collapse occurred just as they were near to the next pier. At that point, the cantilever was at its longest and hence most vulnerable stage. The forces in the bridge at the root of the cantilever were at their maximum. As a direct consequence, a steel diaphragm at the pier buckled, the bridge effectively broke its back, the end of the cantilever fell to the ground and the span ended up broken and leaning at a sharp angle on the first pier.",

            "text": "At West Gate, all of the long approach spans were constructed in concrete. The main span over the river and the two spans each side of the river were designed as a composite structure-a steel box girder topped by a concrete deck. This was quite unusual at the time for a bridge of this size but was used because of political pressure to have as much local content as possible. The problem was that the Australian steel mills could not produce enough steel of the required quality for a full steel design. Also, there had been problems with cracking in the steel beams of a bridge built earlier in Melbourne. Long-span bridges have to be made as light as possible because the effect of its own weight is large when compared to the effects of the traffic. The result was that the erection of the bridge was challenging. The method of erection of the first of the steel spans was quite different from that used at Milford Haven. Two full span lengths of half boxes were assembled on the ground directly alongside the span. So, if you imagine the bridge in cross section, the joint between the two halves was down the centre line of the bridge. Each half section was the length of the span. After assembly, each one was jacked on towers high into the air and moved across to the final position on top of the piers at either end. The adjacent steel plates along the centre line were then to be joined together to form the full cross section. The joint was to be made by inserting a series of friction grip bolts into pre-drilled holes on both sides of the centre line. The problem was that the half sections were asymmetrical, and the abutting plates were very flexible. Consequently, the plates buckled and distorted along their length. It was difficult to get the holes in the steel plates aligned so the bolts could be inserted and tightened. The spans on the east side of the river were constructed first-to learn lessons that could be used for the west side.",

In Fig. 9 .3, Christopher is shaking hands with the Governor of Victoria Major General Sir Rohan Delacombe. Christopher remembers that on the fateful day Jack and Peter came to him on the east side of the river. They had received a message that there was a problem on the west side-advice was needed but there was no indication that it was critical. Jack asked Christopher to accompany him. As they prepared to take the ferry, Christopher saw something that concerned him with the jacking operation to enable the cantilevered span to land on the next pier on his side of the river and he felt he needed to attend to it. So, he asked Jack if he could sort that out first before joining them on the west bank. Jack agreed and with Peter boarded the ferry to cross to the other side of the river. Christopher went up and on to the deck of the eastern span. A little later he was briefing some of the men when they heard a horrendous crash coming from the west bank. Christopher told me that the noise, dust and smoke is something he and the others will never forget-the western span had collapsed killing 35 men on the bridge including Jack and Peter who had only just reached the top of the deck.",

They concluded 'There can be no doubt that the particular action which precipitated the collapse\u2026. was the removal of a number of bolts from a transverse splice in the upper flange plating near to mid-span. The As I later read the Commissioner's report, I began to realize that Christopher and his colleagues on site had to deal with a set of very complex technical issues-box girders were state of the art at the time. Freeman Fox were at the top of the game technically and pushing at the boundaries of what was possible. The whole episode was really about solving a hugely difficult technical problem very severely aggravated by the political and commercial pressures surrounding the project. The role of the Bridge Authority, the human and organisational factors especially in the London office of Freeman Fox, the inexperience of the contractor and the consequential difficulties on site, had not just been circumstantial to technical matters, but had been a central part of the reason for the collapse and loss of life. In the whole of my engineering education up to that moment I had never been asked to even think about human and organisational factors. I realised for the first time that engineering is not just a technical discipline. Above all, engineering is a risky activity done by people for people. As we have seen in earlier chapters when it is done well it contributes to the quality of life. But if the people involved make mistakes that are not just narrowly technical but also include poor management practice, then lives may well be lost. In retrospect, this now sounds all too obvious but at the time it began to help me make sense of all sorts of issues deriving from the narrow technical focus of my education. It also led directly to my later work with Barry Turner and his theory of 'incubating' accidents-waiting-to-happen'. 5",

The feeling that someone close has suffered in vain is very painful. We naturally want to learn the lessons. But how realistic is it to believe with absolute certainty it will never happen again. History does repeat itself-we can, and we do attempt to learn the lessons and reduce the risks down to acceptable levels-but they are never zero. We know that sloppy thinking, negligence, corruption and wrongdoing have to be rooted out. But failures incubate in many various guises and investigators may get so immersed in the details of specific events that they fail to spot the 'big picture' patterns that Barry Turner's incubating accidents model suggests. Incubation, or accident waiting to happen, as used by Turner, is an emergent property of events. Likewise, so is the actual catastrophe as the incubating preconditions are triggered by a final event. People responsible for projects need to look for signs that the pressures in Turner's balloon are growing and when necessary take action to reduce them. In other words, they have constantly to be prepared, vigilant and careful-actively looking for evidence of incubating issues and being ready to act-to spend money to save money-especially with low-chance high-consequence risks. Some of the detailed things we learn are common sense. West Gate tells us rather obviously 'Don't position site huts under the bridge you are building'. But what might be the cost-risk benefit on a future restricted site where positioning the huts somewhere else is an upfront immediate real cost? Other lessons are much less straightforward and more general. For example, being prepared to admit you don't know when that is genuinely the case risks you being seen to be incompetent. Someone else may claim to know-when perhaps the fact that they don't know only emerges later after they have gained the advantage.",

We are, in effect, a massive collection of organised interacting atoms-interacting simpler things that lead, in successive layers, to more complex things. Unfortunately, the systems carry a bevy of uncertainties and unintended consequences from the interactions such as disease.

The loss of Aristotle's idea of practical wisdom as phronesis (Chap. 3) in modern times means that we simply do not recognise, value or nurture it. Not only that, practical people are made to feel inferior compared to those with more theoretical knowledge. Of course, the roots of this loss are complex as Aristotle's ideas have been interpreted and modified by many historical developments. For more on this see. 10 Practice is often criticised as being ad hoc and lacking rigour because engineers use approximations and judgment. In fact, engineers must be, and are, rigorous in a different way for two compelling reasons. Firstly, engineering products will inevitably be subject to the ultimate test-that of Mother Nature. If a bridge structure is inadequate to take the imposed forces, then it will collapse. This enforces a kind of 'natural honesty' and trustworthiness-a requirement that cannot be twisted by propaganda or 'spin'. Secondly, engineers have a legal duty of care to society. Under this duty engineers must justify their decisions, if called upon to do so (e.g. when something goes wrong), in a society that questions expertise.",

It is top-down reasoning, i.e. theorems (at the bottom) are deduced from axioms (including rules) which are true (at the top) by definition. The result is a self-consistent body of true statements-but only if the axioms correspond to reality. An example of where there are differences in the axioms is Euclidean plane geometry, (that we learnt at school with axioms that apply only to 2D plane surfaces) and spherical geometry (used by navigators, surveyors and astronomers with axioms that apply to a sphere). Science is rigorous in an opposite way to mathematics because it is reasoning from the bottom up. Put simply scientists' construct theories (at the top) and use them to deduce propositions (at the bottom) that they can test with an experiment. If successful, then they have a truth or a fact (at the bottom). Unfortunately, one fact (at the bottom) does not prove that the theory (at the top) is true in all circumstances. That is because there could be lots of other propositions deducible from the theory in many different circumstances which haven't been tested, or just haven't been thought of, and which could turn out not to be true. We can never be sure because there are so many possibilities. Nevertheless, the more successful tests we conduct then the more we understand the context in which the theory works and the more dependable it is to make practical decisions.

Practitioners make sensible approximations that respect nature but provide useful insights into possible future behaviours as well as using creative foresight to imagine what could possibly happen. Practical rigour requires diligence and duty of care that leaves no stone unturned with no sloppy or slip-shod thinking. Practical solutions must meet explicit needs and deliver a system valued in a variety of ways. Those ways are not just efficiency or cost but including such criteria as aesthetics, sustainability, practicability and resilience. Solutions have to be scanned for possible unintended consequences before being implemented, and able to be monitored to identify them during use. Because a practical system has to work for a particular period of time then the principle of Preparedness is required to be ready to monitor, fine-tune, readjust and maintain performance. That requires finding and evaluating evidence that we can depend on. That evidence needs to be testable, if possible, in as many ways as seems appropriate-for example, data from measurements will allow judgements about performance such as the displacements of a retaining wall or length of cracks in an aeroplane wing. Judgements can differ between individuals with similar levels of competence-which is why calm critical discussion is so important. Good judgment is a critical part of practical rigour. Professional opinions are not arbitrary, rather they are based on practical wisdom. Engineers test their judgements by asking themselves this question. Could we justify our decisions in court?",

Possibilities include using large banks of batteries (as Solar Impulse), pumping water and recovering energy (as hydroelectricity), employing superconducting magnets or flywheels, and electrolysing water to generate hydrogen to power fuel cells.

Similar approaches could be developed for coal-burning electric power plants in which smokestacks become absorption towers. But once sequestered the gas how has to be stored. Suggestions include old gas and oil fields, but they aren't on their own large enough. Carbon dioxide with water can be severely corrosive as carbonic acid. In 2017, a number of researchers reported 14 on 20 options for better stewardship of land. They identified and quantified 'natural climate solutions' to increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands and agricultural lands. They argued that the actions could mitigate around 37% of the cost-effective carbon dioxide needed through to 2030 with a greater than 66% chance of holding warming to below 2\u00b0C. The actions also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat and enhanced climate resilience.

They are demands riddled with unintended consequences ranging from the 'dark web' to 'sexting' teenagers, self-harm and suicides. Encryption is a central issue-converting the syntax of meaningful patterns of sensitive information into code that is not meaningful unless you have a decoder. Sensitive information includes passwords, banking data, credit card numbers and other personal and private data. Unencrypted data is often called plaintext. Current methods use an encryption key to convert plaintext into ciphertext. Brute force is the crudest method to attack it-systematically trying each key until one that works is foundin that case, the strength of an encryption is directly related to the length of the key. End-to-end encryption is more subtle because only the sender and receiver can decrypt it-no one else (including the Internet service or applications providers) or hacker can read it without some cryptanalysis-finding out weaknesses. Legitimate users benefit from secure encryption. Illegitimate use (for example, by terrorists or pornographers) is a threat because it is tricky for law enforcement agencies to get access. One suggestion that would be difficult to implement in practice is to divide a key into pieces so no one person or agency alone could decide to use it.

The layers are very strong but flexible, transparent and with high conductivity so that they can be used in transistors without any doping. Potential applications are just emerging.

In the past century, mass production has given us good quality products from furniture and clothing to food and drugs to bicycles and cars. We have enjoyed things we might simply have not been able to afford if individually produced by a craftsperson. But it has eroded our sense of individuality and identity. People look for and value highly individual creativity in art and design. Mass production can result in uniformity-sometimes drab like houses set out in box-like estates. Modern techniques such as 3-D printing create the possibility of much more individuality. The word printing is possibly misleading. Rather it is bespoke engineering by getting personal.

It is a long way from being smart in the sense of creating understanding, knowledge and is totally devoid of anything approaching wisdom. The future smart city is often quoted as having digital technology integrated across many services such as schools, libraries, entertainment, transportation, power and water supplies, waste management and law enforcement-but to be a really smart city the digital systems will need to be embedded in ingeniously wise human and social systems that are fully integrated by identifying cross-cutting processes. 5 Smart buildings will be accessed by autonomous vehicles, incorporate solar walls and panels, have advanced computer-assisted energy management, with as much natural lighting and green space as possible, but at the same time must cherish our environmental and contextual heritage.

This is not a call for technocracy-government by an elite of technical experts. Technocracy means that leaders are chosen for their expertise and unelected. Technocracy is undemocratic. Of course, governments can and do consult experts of all kinds in making policy. However, there is often a lack of mutual understanding of the issues. For example, for many years, despite being advised to the contrary, governments in the UK did not seem to realise that lack of continuity of policy in providing and maintaining infrastructure created extra and avoidable costs. Partly, as a consequence, many engineers find the kind of decision making of politicians and civil servants rather baffling. If engineers are to be at the heart of public decision making there will have to be a change in the current culture of engineering education and professional development. There will need to be a much greater empathy, connection and integration with other disciplines especially the social sciences, law, medicine but also surprisingly perhaps with science and philosophy. James Crowden shows us that an engineering education can be a preparation for a life outside of the profession. Though usually conceived as a vocational subject, engineering, by its very nature, is an essential part of the human condition and needs to be taught in that way. Teachers of engineering should be aware that as well as teaching to engineering they can teach through engineering.",

In his 1959 Rede Lecture, at the University of Cambridge, Snow said that the split was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems. Mitcham's gap is not between two forms of knowledge production but rather between two forms that are practical action and consequences. He contrasts designing and constructing the world-by which he means engineering in its broadest sense-with reflecting on what it means-by which he means the humanities.

In his lucid account of law as engineering David Howarth, a distinguished academic lawyer and politician, has written about transactional and legislative law 17 : '\u2026like engineers\u2026lawyers want to make something useful that works for their clients. They are presented with problems to solve, an undesired current state of affairs, and a desired future state of affairs with obstacles and risks lying between the two'. The objects created by lawyers are not metal or concrete or plastic but relationships between people and designed in words rather than in drawings. The forces that lawyer's harness are not natural physical laws but human and can include the coercive power of the state. Contracts, companies, conveyances, wills, trusts, regulations, statutes and constitutions are all useful objects designed and created by lawyers and in engineering terms are devices that produce change in the world outside of the device. Likewise, Harvard economics professor Alvin Roth pointed out in 2002 that whilst the economic environment evolves it is also designed. Entrepreneurs, managers, legislators, regulators, lawyers and judges all get involved in the design of economic institutions. Gregory Mankiw, also an economist at Harvard, agrees that economists should think of themselves as engineers rather than scientists. In April 2019, a major conference on economics as engineering was held in the USA. 18",

In other words, just as truth is an attribute of what we think we know so is risk an attribute of how we think about how we should act. Risk, perceived and interpreted in one context, doesn't easily transfer to other contexts. For example, many people accept higher risks when driving a car than when they are flying in an aeroplane because they feel in control driving a car but at the mercy of others in an aeroplane. Most experts agree on variations of a basic definition of risk as 'the chance that a particular set of conditions will happen in a stated context in the future' but interpretations differ. For example, statisticians emphasise probability as chance or degree of belief, psychologists see it in terms of how people think, feel and act and engineers see it in terms of safety and performance factors. When the risky set of conditions spell danger or harm then they are a hazard. The flip side when the conditions promise a benefit then they are an opportunity. A simple hazard is a trailing wire that someone may trip over. A complex hazard is the difficult to spot incubating conditions of an 'accident waiting to happen' as first articulated by Barry Turner. A chance, such as 1 in 1000, is the ratio of the number of times an event may occur to the number of possible future scenarios. So, for every 1000 possibilities 1 might occur. This kind of thinking is straightforward for a simple problem like the tossing of a dice or the spinning of a roulette wheel. Unfortunately, problems that involve the way people behave are often complex because people have the propensity to do the unexpected. In some instances, anything could happen. We have to admit the possibility of unknown unknowns and utter surprises like 9/11 and the 2008 banking collapse or the 2020 coronavirus in China. We now know that even simple physical systems can, under certain circumstances, be complex. Results from new theories of 'chaos' show that even quite simple deterministic processes, like the rotation of a hinged pendulum, can be unpredictable. In other words, in some situations, the number of possible futures is infinite. Therefore, a chance of one in infinity is zero and meaningless. Of course we can and do produce theories that project the past into the future, including risk analyses and predictions, but we should always remember that the theories depend on context and the principle of the unintended rules risk for any other than quite simple contexts (like a roulette wheel).",

Vulnerability is the opposite to resiliencea susceptibility to damage of the 'weakest link'. The weakest link in a chain defines the total strength of the chain even if every other link is very strong. A really tough, strong boxer with a weak chin is only as strong as his chin. A vulnerable system is not robust, i.e. not strong, healthy, hardy and able 'to take a knock' or persist when subject to changes or perturbations and uncertain conditions.

Politics also needs leaders who inspire consensus, encourage collaboration and recognise interdependence to find and deliver integrated levels of purpose. Politics does not need leaders who follow blind doctrinaire 'policy red lines'. Greg Young has written 20 that leaders shape the culture of an organisation-a large factor controlling performance. He writes about companies, but his ideas also relate to the politics of nation states. He calls for a new kind of 'transpersonal leader' for the twenty-first century where companies (and countries) need to be nimble and agile in responding to rapid change. These leaders will embed authentic, ethical and emotionally intelligent behaviours into the DNA of the organisation (country). They will build strong, empathetic, collaborative trusting relationships and develop a sustainable performance enhancing culture.",

Third to suggest some 'grounding' principles that may help us to guide or steer our way through a risky future. In Chap. 1, I quoted Sir Neil Cossons challenge to engineers to 'spread the word to the rest of the world, get out of your professional bunkers and meet the people, ignite in them some of the magic of what it is that you do'.

If in doubt, just think of your mobile/cell phone and how only a generation ago that kind of performance and functionality was science fiction. Think of Ben's pacemaker and how astonishing it is that a small gadget implanted in his chest can save his life. Think of a big bridge like the magnificent Millau Viaduct in France which certainly has a 'wow' factor. Think how people can talk, face to face, across oceans via satellite communications.

            "text": "But modern engineers specialise in one of the branches of engineering-and the result is often a lack of 'joined-up' thinking to address 'big picture' issues. As scientific knowledge grew after the Renaissance, so the professions fragmented into their 'silos'. You will recall that the six main 'horizontal' branches are civil, mechanical, electrical, aerospace, computing and medical. The 'vertical' divisions include engineering workers, technicians, incorporated and chartered engineers. However, different countries use different terminologies-in North America, the roughly equivalent term for UK chartered engineer is professional engineer. We have traced the stories behind some of the important engineers of the past such as Michael Faraday, Joseph Bazalgette, William Armstrong, Thomas Edison and Frank Whittle as well as some of the less well-known engineers of the present-many of them women. These people are just as important to our national and international culture as politicians and celebrities because engineering is at the heart of society. We rely on it every day and it contributes to our well-being-from the roof over our heads, the food we eat, the water we drink, disposal of waste (including flushing toilets), the roads and railways we travel on through to media, communications, tv and radio, and medical equipment such as scanners. We have also seen that engineering is often taken for granted and hence undervalued-for example, lists of creative occupations rarely mention science or engineering and economic progress is rarely understood as depending on new technology. Design is often presumed to be individual emotional expression through form, appearance and symbolism whilst function is prosaic and delivered by the precision of science. Consequently, engineering as applying those laws is dismissed as being relatively straightforward.",

But largely unappreciated is the idea that aesthetics is more than just beauty but concerns our emotional relationship with things. To engineer is to solve problems as only we humans can but, historically, we have also underrated practical experience and overvalued academic ability to an extent that mars our educational systems. The Roman Vitruvius understood this when he articulated a set of objectives for practice as firmness (integrity or soundness of form), function (looking for simplicity in complexity) and delight (grace as elegance of form). Buckminster Fuller expressed the aesthetic of a structure as being 'where the stresses and strains are at ease'. What he was saying is that the aesthetic of function is an elegance of flow of energy. For example, in the way the pressure, volume, velocity and temperature of gas are manipulated in a gas turbine engine to create the thrust that propels the aircraft. The way the complicated behaviour of the Internet emerges from the layers of interacting simplicity.",

This derives from the caricature of science as the 'laying bare' of the inviolable nature rather than the creative result of individual inspiration to model what we experience. Science does not have all the answers we need-it is incomplete. We can expect our buildings to be 'as safe as houses' as long as we understand that does not imply perfection. There is always a risk that any engineered thing can fail. When things do fail because of negligence or evident lack of duty of care then those responsible should be brought to justice.

We have made nuclear weapons, missiles, remotely controlled drones and created the potential for cyberattacks on our information systems by hostile powers-including terrorists. We have polluted our environment and altered our climate. The global 'grand challenges' are many but include risk and resilience, bioengineering, energy policy, new materials and bespoke engineering. If we are to meet these challenges, then it is imperative, therefore, that we learn from the ways engineered things fail. Engineers need to break down their professional silos by adopting 'joined-up' systems thinking. They need to more readily see the 'big picture', the context, as they contemplate the detail. Whilst we can never ensure that failures 'never happen again' we can reduce the risks to acceptable levels, and we can design our systems to be more resilient. To do that we need to spot the 'patterns' as they incubate. I have suggested five grounding principles that have been, in my view, implicit in the best engineering of the past and missing in the worst, and from which we would benefit if they should become explicit in the future. You will recollect that they are PUPIL, 'we are Part of a world of Unintended consequences for which we need to be Prepared through Ingenuity and Learning. PUPIL tells us that we are of this world not just in the world and so we are both parts and wholes. It points out that everything we decide and act on has unintended consequences-some good and some bad. It helps us to recognise and hence deal with unknown unknowns through contingency planning. PUPIL cautions us to be prepared by developing resilient and agile systems that take us away from our current focus on prediction to thinking through how we manage outcomes, no matter how unlikely, that avoid misplaced 'triumphalism' of human technological progress. It advises us to revalue and nurture the lost art of practical wisdom to reduce the 'ingenuity-gap' between those who adapt well to complex changes and those that don't and the chasm between academic and vocational education. PUPIL admonishes us if we are not pupils in life, i.e. we don't 'learn from our mistakes'-something we constantly avow to do but often fail to implement. It warns us that engineering education has placed little or no emphasis on the history of its disciplines-with the consequence that many of today's engineers see little value in their heritage.",

As I said in the Preface, the USA National Academy of Engineering has a campaign called 'Changing the Conversation'. It has four messages: engineers make a world of difference, engineers are creative problem solvers, engineers help shape the future and engineering is essential to our health, happiness, and safety. Engineering is done by people for people to improve the human condition. Engineers are agents of change-they create technology by configuring patterns of flowing energy to achieve a desired outcome, a human purpose. There is a strong case for engineering to be conceived as a much wider discipline than it is currently the case. Politics, law and economics are forms of engineering-helping to engineer the flourishing of life on earth.",

We must prepare ourselves to face future challenges that we cannot yet anticipate. The UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has pointed out that the Barry Turner incubation of the issues around climate change is well underway (although I have no way of knowing if he is aware of Turners work) when he said 'The world reached several dire milestones in 2017'. 21 He calls for us to 'let some of the air out of the Turner balloon' if we are to avoid some of the extreme events that threaten our futures when he says '\u2026.we continue to see huge investments in unsustainable infrastructure that lock in bad practices for decades. As many have pointed out, the Stone Age did not end because the world ran out of stones. It ended because there were better alternatives. And the same applies today to fossil fuels. Our problem is not that we do not know what to doit is how quickly we can do it'. 21 A new breed of engineers is required who can read and interpret the signs and change the conversation by initiating, discussing and debating with society at large the technical challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. A new perspective on engineering by non-technically trained people could give greater value to the contribution that engineers make. The media should either appoint engineering correspondents or change their technology and their science correspondents to report on engineering as a whole (rather than their current tendency to focus on digital systems). Any form of triumphalism and hype is unhealthy-but it can only be countered by the better understanding of non-specialists. At root the message is that despite all the advances in science, we know less actually than we think we know. Contingency planning that expects surprises must be the new norm. Learn anew how to learn together is the new wisdom. Use the golden rule 'do not do to others that you would not have them do to you', whatever you are told to believe is the tenet we should always hold foremost in our thoughts. Behaviour is more important than belief-imperfect doing is better than uncertain knowing. But to do all of this collectively requires leadership that we can trust-perhaps the biggest challenge of all?",

The buckle in turn, had been caused by the application of kentledge (heavy weight) in an attempt to overcome difficulties caused by errors in camber. To attribute the failure of the bridge to this single action of removing bolts would be entirely misleading. In our opinion, the sources of the failure lie much further back; they arise from two main causes. Primarily the designers of this major bridge, FF & P (Freeman Fox and Partners) failed altogether to give a proper and careful regard to the process of structural design. They failed also to give a proper check to the safety of the erection proposals put forward by the original contractors, WSC (World Services and Construction Pty Ltd). In consequence, the margins of safety for the bridge were inadequate during erection; they would also have been inadequate in the service condition had the bridge been completed. A secondary cause leading to the disaster was the unusual method proposed by WSC for the erection\u2026. This erection method, if it was to be successful, required more than usual care on the part of the contractor and a consequential responsibility on the consultants to ensure that such care was indeed exercised. Neither contractor, WSC nor later JHC (John Holland & Co), appears to have appreciated this need for great care, while the consultants FF & P, failed in their duty to prevent the contractor from using procedures liable to be dangerous'.",

A man engine was a mechanism of reciprocating ladders and platforms for miners to travel up and down between working levels during the nineteenth century. It was invented in Germany but used in the tin and copper mines in Cornwall until the beginning of the twentieth century. The Cornish Man Engine puppet is a 10-metre-high giant mechanism built in 2016 to mark the 10th anniversary of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape becoming a World Heritage site.

The events at West Gate Bridge and failures in social services and criminal justice systems seem, at first sight, to have little in common. Closer examination reveals that lack of communication across organisational silos is common to all. The murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 shocked the nation in 2000. Harold Shipman was a family doctor who was found guilty in 2000 of murdering many of his patients. In 2002, Ian Huntley was found guilty of the Soham murders. A policy briefing by the UK Local Government Information Unit in 2003 said 'Despite all the initiatives for joint working and local partnerships, a silo mentality still appears to persist in government departments'. In all of these cases, a lack in the joining-up of agencies led to disastrous consequences. Pieces of evidence, considered in isolation, were pieces of a jigsaw. Had the pieces been put together, then a very different picture would have emerged. 7. Acker, F. (2005) Autism and Engineers-is there a connection? Ingenia, Issue 25, December 2005.
