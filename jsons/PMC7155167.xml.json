The inhaled route of administration is chosen to be effective for delivering different types of preventer and reliever drugs to patients with airway obstructions owning the unique advantage of delivering relatively small doses of drug directly to the respiratory tract airways for achieving a high local concentration and diminishing systemic adverse effects; besides they may provide considerable cost savings because of the lower dosage regimens, especially with expensive therapeutic agents. Consequently, this results in a high therapeutic ratio as compared with other systemic drug delivery either through oral or parenteral route of administration (Borghardt et al., 2018). Numerous and countless studies have shown that the lungs provide substantially superior bioavailability (BA) for macromolecules than any other route of drug delivery to the systemic circulation (Paranjpe and M\u00fcller-Goymann, 2014; Javadzadeh and Yaqoubi, 2017).",

This was achieved by developing a pharmaceutical dosage form known as the aerosols that was able to do that. Aerosols dosage forms are designed to be sprayed into the mouth which causes their contents to expel from the container directly into the lungs so as to deposit there and employ their anticipated action. Aerosols contain the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in combination with additional excipients in the form of fine mist. To form the final dosage, the ingredients are packaged with the aid of pressure to form a pressurized dispenser called the aerosol container. The excipients and therefore the components of the aerosol container along with plenty of other factors are accountable for the aerosols dosage form to indicate optimum function. Thus various quality control tests are performed to these dosage forms to guarantee that the ultimate product is at its optimum performance with the highest safety and that they fulfill product specifications which are going to be discussed in details throughout this chapter (Sahab et al., 2016).",

The nose, sinuses, pharynx, and upper larynx are components of the upper portion, whereas the lower larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs belong to the lower. Accordingly, anatomical classification rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and the common cold are considered as upper respiratory tract diseases caused by bacterial or viral pathogens. Examples of such pathogenic microorganisms are stained Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. On the other hand, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are Gram-negative bacteria (Mhlanga et al., 2018). Respiratory viral pathogens that cause illness such as Parainfluenza virus, Coxsackie, influenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus are considered of being harmless, nevertheless in third world countries, they are a cause of death (Laut et al., 2015). The policy of resolving upper respiratory tract infections involves relieving pain, reduce congestion, surprising cough, and inhibiting the growth of pathogens or eradicating them. Pharmacological treatment includes several categories of medications such as anticholinergics, antitussives, the first generation of antihistamine, decongestants, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and antivirals. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin, clindamycin, benzathine benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, and erythromycin are mutual bacterial infections treatments. One of the foremost mistakes in the treatment plan is prescribing antibiotics for the viral pathogenic cause of infections due to a misdiagnosis that consequently elevates the possibility of microbial resistance (Mhlanga et al., 2018).",

Increasing air flow rates raise the outcome effectiveness effect for the velocity-reliant particles deposition impaction mechanism while decreasing the effectiveness effect for time-reliant particles deposition diffusion and sedimentation mechanisms. Increasing tidal lung volumes permit particles to reach and distribute more in distal respiratory aeries, where the likely main particles deposition are governed by sedimentation and diffusion; therefore, the total input to overall deposition compared to deposition by impaction is increased. During exercise, both tidal volumes and breathing flow rates are increased, resulting in an increased deposition by sedimentation and diffusion in the small respiratory airways and alveoli; on the other hand, those conditions increase particles impaction in the large airways. Finally, mouth breathers will result in more particle deposition in respiratory tract than nose breathers because of the nasal efficient particles filtering compared to that of an oral route (Sankhal et al., 2013).",

There is a great number of variations in total respiratory particles deposition among normal healthy subjects breathing in the same pattern because of inters subject variability. Even within the same individual, age and pathological processes along with the changes in dimensions and features of the tracheobronchial tree of the respiratory system with lung volume. Gender differences in anatomical respiratory system structure and modulators of lung function also cause variations in deposition between men and women. For example, deposition in the lung tracheobronchial tree is higher in women compared to that in men as the average female thorax dimension is smaller than that in men and lower conducting airways volume which is only around 75% that in men. So far, when these anatomical gender volume variances are shared with lesser resting minute ventilation volume (volume of gas inhaled or volume exhaled) and breathing flow rates pragmatic in women, total respiratory particles deposition is lesser in women than in men mainly for the reason that a smaller dispersion of the aerosol occurs in the alveolar distal region of the female lung. Respiratory airway breathing conditions and geometry develop from birth to maturity. These changes affect respiratory elements\u2019 deposition in childhood. According to studies on particle deposition among children, the respiratory particles deposition in children tend to be higher compared to that in adults by an average factor of 1.5, and because of their minor lung surface area than that of adults, the quantity of particles deposited per surface area is higher by a factor of 4 or 5 in children (Sankhal et al., 2013).",

These receptacles are full of with standard test solutions each with defined specific gravity proposed to assesses variation in valve delivery. These solutions are alcohol USP-NF, isopropyl myristate (0.1%), dichlorodifluoromethane (49.95%), trichloromonofluoromethane at 25\u00b0C. Subsequently, a 0.02-in. actuator is mounted on each valve and then the filled containers are located in 25\u00b0C\u00b11\u00b0C airspace so that they will change to that temperature. These filled receptacles are actuated to the fullest extent for at least 2 seconds and weighed. Difference between determined weights represents delivery in mg.

Closed cup tests purpose to simulate the situation of a fluid spill in a closed environmental condition. For any liquid of the test sample if it is at, or above, its flash point, a fire or explosion is a possibility once exposed to a possible ignition source. In closed cup tests to determine the flash point the investigated sample is placed inside a sealed test cup and introduced to a potential ignition source, determining the temperature at which the sample flashes.

The obtained flash point is typically referring to the most flammable component\u2019s flash point (Parmar and Patel, 2017).

Though a series of glass slides and nozzles projects a high-velocity stream of particles, an impactor can classify particles into known size ranges. The powerful air jets from these device nozzles impact on flat sampling surfaces, and each phase collects finer sized particles than its predecessor. The large particles are impacted and collected first on the plane stages of lower velocity, and the small particles will pass and get collected at the stages of higher velocity. Particles having adequate inertia will impact on related particular stage collection plate, whilst finer particles will stay entrained in the air stream and move to the next stage where the process is repeated (Lashkar, 2012).
