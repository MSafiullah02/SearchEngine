            "text": "Macrolides are bacteriostatic antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against many Gram-positive and atypical bacterial species commonly associated with respiratory tract infections (Min and Jang, 2012, NIH, 2017). As well as their antibacterial effects, macrolides have been shown to have immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects (Amsden, 2005, Kanoh and Rubin, 2010, Nakamura et al., 1999, Wales and Woodhead, 1999, Zarogoulidis et al., 2012). Morbidity and mortality caused by respiratory viral infections is associated with the excessive elaboration of cytokines and immunopathologic host inflammatory responses (Min and Jang, 2012, Mosquera et al., 2014, Us, 2008, Wang et al., 2012). Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that macrolides downregulate the inflammatory response, attenuating extreme cytokine production and promote the induction of immunoglobulin antibodies (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2009), which may reduce the complications of respiratory viral infections (Lee et al., 2017, Lendermon et al., 2017, Min and Jang, 2012, Us, 2008, Wang et al., 2012). Given these properties, macrolides (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fidaxomicin, telithromycin) have been studied for their potential use as targeted therapy for a wide spectrum of viral respiratory infections including influenza (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2009, Min and Jang, 2012, Suzuki et al., 2002, Tahan et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Clinical studies of macrolides in patients with viral respiratory infections have yielded contradictory results. In a retrospective analysis, use of clarithromycin with oseltamivir or zanamivir was associated with restoration of attenuated antiviral mucosal and systemic immunity and reduction in the re-infection rate in pediatric patients with influenza (Shinahara et al., 2013). In another study, pediatric patients with influenza-related symptoms were randomly assigned to groups receiving either cephalosporins or macrolides. In this study, macrolides were found to be more effective for alleviating fever and reducing the occurrence of pneumonia (Ninomiya et al., 2002). In a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related bronchiolitis, administration of clarithromycin daily for three weeks was associated with reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS), supplemental oxygen, the need for \u03b22-agonists, and hospital readmission. In addition, it was associated with reduction in plasma interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-8 and eotaxin levels (Tahan et al., 2007). In an open-label, prospective RCT, clarithromycin was associated with fever reduction in adult patients with influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection who were treated with neuraminidase inhibitors. However, there was no difference in the reduction of serum IL-6 levels between the study groups (Higashi et al., 2014). Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label RCT, a combination therapy of osteltamivir and azithromycin was associated with early resolution of some clinical symptoms but no difference in inflammatory cytokine levels (Kakeya et al., 2014). In a recent open-label RCT of hospitalized adults, early combination therapy with clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir was associated with reduced 30-day and 90-day mortality and hospital LOS compared to oseltamivir monotherapy (Hung et al., 2017). Similar results were obtained from secondary analysis of a multicenter RCT, in which use of the macrolides azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin was associated with improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with acute lung injury (Walkey and Wiener, 2012).",

This study showed when adjusted for possible confounders using logistic regression analysis, macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant change in 90-day mortality. This may suggest that immunomodulatory effects of macrolides alone may not be effective on improving mortality rate in patients with MERS in the absence of effective antiviral drugs against MERS-CoV.",

An in vitro study on human bronchial epithelial cells showed that azithromycin significantly reduced rhinovirus replication and release (Gielen et al., 2010, Schogler et al., 2015). However, another study reported that azithromycin did not directly alter viral replication or clearance of parainfluenza type 1, Sendai Virus in mice (Beigelman et al., 2010). Similarly, in an RCT, azithromycin therapy in infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis did not facilitate RSV clearance from the upper airway compared to placebo (Beigelman et al., 2015). In an RCT, adults hospitalized for laboratory confirmed influenza were randomized to receive oseltamivir and azithromycin or oseltamivir alone, both for 5 days (Lee et al., 2017). Pro-inflammatory cytokines declined faster in the oseltamivir-azithromycin group. However, viral RNA decline was not affected (Lee et al., 2017). Our study is the first to have investigated the association between macrolide therapy and MERS-CoV RNA clearance. Our results showed that macrolide therapy had no significant association.",

This study also used an international standardised data collection tool. We adjusted for possible confounders including community-acquired infection, because of the probable association of this variable with both the exposure (macrolide therapy) and outcomes. Since macrolide therapy was initiated early during the ICU course, the risk of immortal time bias (survivorship bias) is probably limited. The main limitation is the retrospective nature of this observational study, and the potential that unmeasured confounders may influence the relationships we sought to examine. Also we did not measure cytokine levels or immune measures that might have been affected by macrolide administration.",
