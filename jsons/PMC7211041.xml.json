As there is currently no vaccine nor effective antiviral therapy for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, innovative approaches need to be developed rapidly. The repurposing of existing drugs, which are currently used, or have been used, against other diseases, represents a potential fast track to effective clinical treatment. Large\u2010scale and hypothesis\u2010free drug screening against viral infections can be costly and time consuming and, therefore targeted strategies are more suitable. However, a major difficulty is often the limited amount of information about the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenicity of a virus when a new outbreak starts.",

Interestingly, GFRs have also been identified as necessary for the entry of some viruses, including coronaviruses, and GFR signaling is involved in viral replication in many instances. Drugs targeting GFRs and their signaling are currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of cancer and given the role of GFRs in virus entry and replication, these drugs could potentially be repurposed against viral infections.

In the adult body, GFRs are involved in the control of cellular turnover and homeostasis, as well as in tissue repair and regeneration, and their deregulation can lead to cancer. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were the first growth factors to be identified, leading to the award of the 1986 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine to Stanley Cohen and Rita Levi\u2010Montalcini.\n6\n, \n7\n Subsequently, the receptor for EGF (EGFR) was characterized and shown to be a transmembrane receptor with an intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that initiates a cascade of downstream protein phosphorylation when it is engaged by EGF.\n6\n As more growth factors were identified, a complex picture of associated GFRs emerged. To date, more than 20 families of GFRs have been described, and, as initially reported for EGFR, most GFRs exhibit a tyrosine kinase activity\n8\n; the only notable exception being the receptors for members of the transforming growth factor betas (TGFbRs), which exhibit a serine/threonine kinase activity.\n9\n Most tyrosine kinase GFRs activate the same set of intracellular kinases, including but not limited to SRC, AKT, PI3PK and ultimately the MAP kinases, all of which translocate into the nucleus to regulate gene expression.\n8\n In contrast, the serine/threonine kinase activity of TGFbRs ultimately leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of members of the SMAD transcription factor family.\n9\n\n",

This is well illustrated by the receptors for the fibroblast growth factors (FGFRs). There are four different FGFRs (FGFRs1\u20104) genes generating seven isoforms. All are expressed in most human cell types and, upon ligand binding, the resultant stimulation of their tyrosine kinases induces a wide range of cellular effects including cell proliferation in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, the migration of endothelial cells, as well as the differentiation of neurons and their subsequent neurite outgrowth. Notably, the activity of FGFRs is also co\u2010regulated by a class of unbranched glycosaminoglycans, the heparan sulfates (HS), which are abundant on both the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix. HSs make many FGF/FGFR interactions much more efficient by cross\u2010binding them into trimeric complexes, thus facilitating the activation of FGFRs and their downstream signaling pathways.\n10\n\n",

This study was also the first to show that tyrosine kinase inhibitors can have substantial antiviral activity.\n12\n In turn, the HCV upregulates EGFR activation, which favors further viral entry.\n13\n The involvement of EGFRs with virus internalization and transport to the endosomal network was further confirmed in the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV)\n14\n, \n15\n as well as for gastroenteritis viruses.\n16\n, \n17\n The vaccinia virus (VACV) has also been shown to co\u2010opt EGFR signaling to enhance virus spread through the stimulation of cell motility that contributes to the rapid spread of infection.\n18\n Significantly, many respiratory viruses have been shown to induce EGFR activation, leading to suppressed interferon regulating factor\u20101 (IRF1)\u2010dependent interferon \u03bb and thus lowered antiviral defense in airway epithelium.\n16\n, \n19\n Thus, EGFRs are not only portals for virus entry, but are also involved in the suppression of the immune response of the host.",
