            "text": "S urgical resection is the primary treatment and typically the only curative therapy for most solid malignancies. Throughout this surgical textbook, virtually all chapters dealing with individual organs have some portion of that chapter devoted to the surgical treatment of primary cancer at that site . For example, Chapter 96 on breast disease primarily discusses the treatment of cancer because this is by far the predominant surgical disease in that organ. On the other hand, Chapter 49 on the small intestine has a much smaller proportion dealing with cancer as primary malignancies comprise a smaller fraction of the surgical diseases involving the small intestine. A specialized type or category of surgical treatment for cancer can be categorized as regional therapy. As opposed to straightforward surgical resection, in this type of therapy a specific region or area of the body is treated. Regional therapy is primarily applicable to metastatic disease limited to one site or area of the body. There are two broad categories of regional therapy of cancer: (1) vascular-based treatments and (2) intracavitary treatments. The most successfully treated areas of the body by vascular means are the extremities and the liver . There is also potential to treat other sites such as the lung or pelvis . The peritoneal cavity and the pleural cavity are areas amenable to intracavitary treatments.",

The majority of regional treatment strategies use standard chemotherapeutic agents. For most antineoplastic drugs, dose escalation to the maximally tolerated level leads to the optimal response rate for that agent . Dose-limiting toxicities vary among different antineoplastic agents, but specific side effects most commonly seen are bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, or neurotoxicity, which provide well-defined limits beyond which it is unsafe to administer any more systemic treatments. If a patient has tumor that is only in one region of the body, such as an extremity, or in one organ, such as the liver, delivery of drug only to that site may allow dose escalation to achieve tissue levels well beyond what can be achieved with maximal systemic drug delivery. When the location of the metastatic cancer differs from the target organ of drug toxicity, the therapeutic index is improved if technical means exist to allow the successful delivery of regional therapy.",

Isolation perfusion is a surgical procedure in which control of the inflow and outflow vessels to and from an organ or region of the body is achieved by operative dissection. That area of the body is then perfused using an extracorporeal bypass circuit which allows continuous recirculation of antineoplastic agent into that area of the body. This technique is advantageous as it not only eliminates the target organ of toxicity for a particular drug, but also may eliminate the organ of metabolism for that drug such that the area under the curve of drug exposure during the time of isolation perfusion is markedly increased. The ability to perform isolation perfusion was dependent upon the technological advance of extracorporeal bypass that was designed primarily to facilitate cardiac operations. With the develop- which has been shown to be effective in vitro to reverse malignant phenotypes, often cannot be translated into in vivo therapies because the vector cannot be delivered successfully to the sites of cancer.

Within the category of regional vascular treatment are two general categories differentiated by the mechanism of drug delivery: (1) regional vascular infusion and (2) isolated vascular perfusion. Regional infusion is technically more straightforward than isolation perfusion and is often performed by an interventional radiologist working in conjunction with medical oncologists. However, the degree of advantage gained in improving the therapeutic index based on regional infusion compared to systemic intravascular delivery is much less than can be achieved by isolated perfusion. By far the most important site of treatment for regional intravascular infusion is the liver. The ability of infusion to be effective in this location is predominantly because of the role the liver plays in drug metabolism. This ability to metabolize drug allows the liver to clear certain agents on the first pass through the liver parenchyma, which is not applicable ment of this technology in the midpart of the twentieth century, surgical oncologists recognized the ability to apply extracorporeal bypass to regional vascular perfusion. 15 In this initial experience, many areas of the body were attempted to be treated with isolation perfusion.\":\" Only treatment of the extremities primarily for in-transit melanoma produced results with positive objective antitumor responses and acceptable toxicity such that the operation became accepted as a standard procedure. Recently, partly because of improved technical aspects of complex surgical procedures as well as the availability of alternative treatment agents, isolation perfusion has been applied to other organs that were abandoned by the earlier investigators 30 to 40 years ago (see Table  103 .3). Specifically, isolation perfusion procedures of the liver l9,2o and lung,21,22 which had been reported as failures as a result of technical difficulties and low response rates, are being actively studied once again. Additional work has been performed on isolation perfusion procedures of the pelvis 23,24 as well as the kidney.\" Because of the multiple areas of vascular inflow and areas of vascular outflow in the pelvis, this has not been as successful as isolation perfusion of the limb or liver. Isolation perfusion of the kidney is technically easier but is limited by the lack of clinical situations in which isolation perfusion would be an optimal outcome as compared to unilateral nephrectomy or renal wedge resection. The application of intravascular regional therapy to the extremities and liver is discussed here in great detail, and experience with isolated perfusion of other areas is also mentioned.",

To attempt to improve these results, more aggressive surgical procedures called peritonectomy procedures have been advocated, as the peritoneal lining is often a barrier against this disease because tumor implants spread on the surface but do not invade through the peritoneum.\" Although peritonectomy including stripping of the lining of the diaphragms, pericolic gutter, anterior abdominal wall, and pelvis is technically possible, the extensive operation removes less than half the potential surfaces available for contamination with intraperitoneal spread.\" Specifically, the capsule of the liver and the capsule of the spleen cannot be completely stripped without leading to life-threatening blood loss. Similarly, the serosa of the stomach, small bowel, and colon cannot be excised, and these are frequently sites where tumor implants will grow. Finally, the mesenteric peritoneum for the small intestine and the transverse mesocolon, although it can be removed in small areas, cannot be completely removed without considerable blood loss and potential ischemic injury to the intestine by damaging mesenteric vessels.

Finally, standard systemic chemotherapy is generally ineffectual against intraperitoneal disease caused by gastrointestinal tumors. Ovarian cancers are more chemoresponsive, but once gross peritoneal carcinomatosis is present (i.e., stage 3 disease), this tumor is almost never cured. This lack of efficacy stems from the general failure of available antineoplastic agents against solid malignancies at any location and is compounded by the inability of intravascular drug delivery to reach peritoneal disease that may be poorly vascularized. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy given via one or even more catheters placed at the time of an operative procedure has been attempted as regional infusional therapy.\" However, after any surgical procedure, particularly when malignancy is involved, the contents of the abdominal cavity become densely adherent to one another, creating multiple isolated areas of peritoneal surfaces.

For both the upper and lower extremity, there is essentially one artery into the extremity and one vein out of the extremity. The exception is the upper extremity where there may be multiple axillary veins, but typically these run in parallel and there is one dominant vessel. Isolated limb perfusion involves cannulating an artery leading to the extremity and a vein leading from the extremity, ligating collateral vascular branches, placing a tourniquet at the root of the extremity, and by these maneuvers there is control over the circulation to that portion of the body. This cannulation can be performed at multiple sites in both the upper and lower extremities. The potential levels for cannulation in the lower extremity are the external iliac vessels via a retroperitoneal approach, the common femoral vessels, and the popliteal vessels. Options for cannulation of the upper extremities are the axillary vessels and the brachial vessels just above the elbow. The level of cannulation is dictated by the disease that is being treated and other factors such as previous surgical dissection, body habitus, or anatomic variations. For in-transit melanoma in which the entire extremity is at risk for disease, the most proximal technically possible cannulation site is utilized. This site is always the axillary vessels for the upper extremity and typically the external iliac vessels for the lower extremity. For soft tissue tumors such as single large extremity sarcomas, the most distal site that can perfuse the entire tumor is utilized as this histology tends not to spread via intradermal lymphatics. An exception to this rule is multifocal sarcomas which act as melanoma such as epithelioid sarcomas and angiosarcomas in which proximal perfusion is indicated.",

With the use of high-dose tumor necrosis factor at several times the lethal systemic dose level, this problem has been magnified. There is much greater potential for leak from the extremity to the rest of the body in isolated limb perfusion compared to isolated organ perfusions including the liver, lung, and kidney in which the dissection can completely isolate that organ and obviate any significant leak. The cross-sectional area of the lower extremity at the pelvis is quite large, and significant potential collaterals exist posteriorly in the gluteal and pudendal vessels and centrally in the obturator vessels. An upper extremity perfusion is more easily controlled as the cross-sectional area of the arm at the shoulder is much smaller and more complete control can be obtained. The maneuvers utilized to achieve vascular isolation of the lower extremity at the external iliac vessels are complete skeletonization of the external iliac artery and vein down into the\u00b7 proximal common femoral vessels, ligating all branches circumferentially. The internal iliac artery is dissected and clamped and the obturator artery is tied. Either the main internal iliac vein or branches of that vein which appear to be going inferiorly to the leg can also be encircled and either tied or clamped. Finally, a tourniquet is placed around the root of the extremity, typically using an Esmarch tape placed in the medial groin crease and controlled laterally with a Steinmann pin in the anterior superior iliac spine. Approaching the lower extremity via the common femoral vessels utilizes a similar application of a tourniquet but does not control the branches above the inguinal ligament and therefore has a greater potential for leak of the perfusate to the systemic circulation. Cannulation via the popliteal vessels utilizes a pneumatic cuff tourniquet in the proximal thigh at 300mmHg, which leads to virtual total isolation of that lower portion of the extremity. For upper extremity perfusions, dissection of all the axillary artery and vein branches and placement of an Esmarch tourniquet around the axilla secured with a small Steinmann pin in the head of the humerus lead to almost complete control of perfusate leak. In fact, the greatest problem with upper extremity ILP is to avoid causing brachial plexus trauma with excessive tightness in the tourniquet.",

Historically, the largest number of ILP procedures have been performed in the adjuvant setting, most commonly after resection of high-risk primary melanoma but also for resection of limited satellite or in-transit metastases.\" Although individual investigators who believe in the benefit of ILP applied this regional technique after resection of highrisk primary lesions (typically primary melanomas more than 1 or 1.5 mm thick), both retrospective case-controlled studies and prospective randomized studies have failed to verify a benefit for this use of ILP. 5 Therapeutic Isolated Limb Perfusion for Extremity Melanoma Therapeutic ILP is defined as procedures that treat measurable disease in the extremity. The response rates that are obtained with ILP are considerably higher than any other systemic therapy for this type of tumor. Although melphalan has very limited activity given systemically against melanoma, it is the optimal chemotherapeutic drug for ILP. 4 1 ,45,54 Objective response rates with melphalan ILP under either normothermic (37\u00b0C) conditions or with mild hyperthermia (38'so-40\u00b0C) have been reported as high as 90% to 100%. These response rates should be placed in context of the responses seen with systemic chemotherapy. The best combination systemic chemotherapy gives a 25% to 40% response rate and a 0% to 5% complete response\" (Table 103 .6). Interleukin 2 treatment results in an 18% to 25% overall response rate and a 7% complete response.\" There have never been any randomized clinical trials comparing melphalan ILP to systemic treatments because of this clear difference in response. Pr\" What is not known is whether this difference in regional response translates into any improvement in survival. The optimal dose of melphalan is calculated based on limb volume, because basing melphalan dose on patient weight may undertreat or overtreat an individual dependent on body habitus.\" Limb volume measurements either with water displacement or sequential circumferential measurements can be obtained with lower extremities treated with 10mg melphalanjL limb volume and upper extremities treated with 13mg melphalanjL limb volume. Even with melphalan dosing based on limb volume, recent studies have shown highly variable perfusate in tissue drug levels, possibly contributing to variable response rates.\"",

The final results of this study have yet to be reported. In Europe, as TNF is an approved agent for ILP for unresectable extremity sarcoma, investigators use TNF selectively in melanoma for reperfusion after melphalan failure or for bulky disease.

However, there is value in the use of TNF in patients with bulky disease and in patients who have failed prior melphalan-alone ILP. 71 One study showed that the overall response rate achieved with melphalan plus TNF was 59%, and in a nonrandomized trial compared to their melphalan-alone perfusions there was no difference in recurrence rate or median limb recurrencefree survival.

Palliation of symptoms within the extremity occurred in 7S% of the patients.P:\" Evidence for the TNF effect includes enhanced response rates in bulky disease as well as responses in patients who have failed melphalan-alone isolated limb perfusion.

The overall approach with large extremity sarcomas that have no local resection options because of relationship to neurovascular and bony structures is to conduct an isolated limb perfusion with TNF and melphalan. This treatment generally results in significant tumor shrinkage by 8 to 12 weeks. At that time, a second procedure is undertaken to resect this smaller tumor. Objective response rates by size criteria in a large European trial of 186 patients were 17% complete response rates and S4% partial response rate .\" When patients do not undergo the secondary resection, there is a high incidence of local recurrenee.\" Other groups have similar although not quite so dramatic response rates. A group from Amsterdam of 48 evaluable patients had a complete response rate of 2% and partial response rate of 47% based on standard size criteria. When they incorporated pathological responses, this increased to 8% complete response rate and 570/0 partial response rate.\" However, because high-grade sarcomas often have a large degree of necrosis without any treatment, it is hard to differentiate tumor necrosis resulting from rapid growth from that induced by the regional therapy. A study from France has questioned whether the dose of tumor necrosis factor used in perfusion for sarcoma is too high. They performed a clinical trial with four doses of TNF (0.5, I, 2, and 3 or 4mg). 84 The response rates of extremity sarcoma in these four dose groups were 680/0, 560/0, 720/0, and 640/0, respectively, showing absolutely no dose effect, and none was significantly different from another. The long-term overall survival and disease-free survival were no different. The authors did comment that the systemic toxicity seen in this patient population was always higher in the higher TNF groups and questioned whether a lower dose may be equally effective but safer. A separate group of sarcoma patients are those in which multifocal disease behaves more as in-transit melanoma metastasis than a single bulky sarcoma; examples include angiosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, and multifocal malignant fibrous histiocytoma. In a series published from Europe, 64 isolated limb perfusions were performed on 53 patients with multifocal disease.\" The overall response rate was 88% with 42% complete response rate and a 46% partial response rate. In this same group of patients, single large lesions had an overall response rate of 690/0 (see Table 103 .8). Just as for melanoma, this perfusion strategy seems to achieve better results when administered for smaller volume, but multifocal, disease. A second clinical situation that often rises in extremity sarcoma is local recurrence after initial resection with maximal radiation therapy. In these situations, the local recurrence often grows in a way in which repeat excision is not possible and, as there is no way to deliver additional radiation therapy, amputation may be the only option. A group of 30 isolated limb perfusions were performed for this indication, with a response rate of 700/0 with 200/0 complete responses and 500/0 partial responses.\" The overall limb salvage was 650/0. There was no increased toxicity seen in this patient group compared to the patients who have not had radiation therapy.",

Reperfusions using the ILP technique have been reported, but again this is more technically challenging and also there is some cumulative toxicity within the extremity.\" An alternative regional treatment for extremity melanoma that has been proposed by Thompson from Australia isolated limb infusion (ILI).14/89 In this setting, a radiologic procedure in which balloon cannulas are utilized is essentially a stop-flow infusion into an extremity with a tourniquet, which allows a relatively acceptable dose of melphalan to be present within the extremity for 15 to 20 min. The objective response rates seen in gross disease in melanoma are significant, considering the ease and dose of agent utilized in this technique. Complete response rates of 30% to 40% and overall response rates of 70% have been reported, and this technique has the advantage of being much easier for reperfusion.\" The Sydney Melanoma Group has furthered this field of isolated limb infusion by developing a salvage regimen. They treated patients who have failed one or more ILls with melphalan in whom amputation was the only other treatment option with ILl with fotemustine after systemic chemosensitization with DTIC. 90 They treated 13 of these patients; 4 had a complete response and 8 had a partial response. However, the median duration of the response was only 3 months, resulting in limb salvage in 5 of 12 assessable patients; this is a very good response rate in a heavily pretreated patient population.",

First, it is commonly the sole site of metastatic disease for a variety of malignancies such as colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gastrointestinal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and ocular melanoma. Also, as an essential organ as opposed to the extremity, liver failure is often the cause of death in patients with metastatic cancer from these primary lesions, so that an effective regional therapy may improve survival. Second, the liver is able to be dissected such that there is essentially no vascular connection to the remainder of the body except via bile duct collaterals. Third, the vascular anatomy favors regional intravascular therapy. Although the dual vascular supply of the hepatic arterial system and the portal vein would appear to complicate regional treatment of the liver to some extent, it offers advantages as well. The branching vasculature in and around the liver offers a straightforward cannulation site via cutdown on the gastroduodenal artery in most patients to allow simple access to the hepatic arterial system for both infusion or isolated hepatic perfusion. Also, studies have demonstrated that the majority of the blood supply from metastatic tumors growing in the hepatic parenchyma is parasitized from the hepatic arterial system, as opposed to the portal venous system, which allows better drug delivery via the hepatic artery.\":\" The final reason why the liver is an excellent organ for regional perfusion is that, as a central component of the body's system to metabolize drugs, extensive clearance of infused agents often occurs after a first pass through the hepatic vasculature, limiting systemic exposure with hepatic infusion.P'!'",

The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the colon/rectum has decreased recently in the United States but there were still an estimated 139,000 cases in 1999. There will be an estimated 42,000 patients with metastases to the liver, and in approximately half these cases the liver will initially be the sole site of metastatic disease. It is estimated that only 10% of these patients would be eligible for complete resection, meaning there are approximately 37,000 new patients per year with colorectal metastases to the liver who are not resectable.\" Historically, the first line of systemic therapy for metastatic colon cancer was fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin, with response rates in the range of 12% to 200/0 and duration of response less than 1 year. There has been tremendous progress in the treatment regimens available for colon cancer, with several new agents and several new treatment combinations reported over the past 5 to 10 years (Table 103 .9). New standard antineoplastic agents such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin as well as targeted therapy such as an antivascular epithelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody (Bevacizimab) and antiepidermal growth factor (anti-EGF antibodies) (Erbitux) have greatly improved the response rate and duration of response for metastatic colorectal cancer in the liver as well as elsewhere.\" With this greatly improved systemic therapy, the role of regional treatment with intraar- terial infusion therapy has greatly diminished in the past 5 years. The theory and results of hepatic arterial infusion therapy are reviewed briefly, and how this regional treatment may be incorporated into current protocols is discussed. The initial regimen used for continuous intraarterial infusion therapy was floxuridine (FUDR). The reason for use of FUDR as opposed to 5-FU is that the extraction in the first pass through the liver with FUDR is in the range of 98% to 990/0 whereas with 5-FU it is 650/0 to 700/0. 10,11 More than 20 years ago, a device was developed that would serve as a subcutaneous pump which at body temperatures would infuse a small quantity of medication such as intraarterial FUDR on a daily basis continually, and these pumps replaced catheters placed percutaneously by radiologists.\"",

At the time when isolated limb perfusion was performed initially in the 1950s, isolated hepatic perfusion was also attempted but, as stated by Dr. Chung, lithe technique for complete isolation of the liver is a relatively complicated procedure because of its anatomic peculiarity.\"16 Specifically, the dual blood supply as well as the reality that the inferior vena cava essentially passes through the posterior liver, with the hepatic veins being broad short structures, make this a much more complex situation than isolated limb perfusion. One recent strategy attempted in performing an isolated hepatic perfusion was a double-lumen cannula that allowed inferior vena cava blood returning from the lower extremities and kidney to pass behind the liver at the same time that hepatic venous return was collected in a recirculating system. A major advance for IHP was the application of a venovenous bypass extracorporeal circuit to shunt both the portal venous flow and the inferior vena cava flow below the level of the liver back to the axillary vein. 20 \u2022 1I 3 This circuit is utilized in liver transplantation when patients are anhepatic, and while the liver is completely isolated it can be used to shunt blood flow peripherally. The hepatic artery can be cannulated via the gastroduodenal artery as in hepatic infusional therapy. The retrohepatic vena cava can be cannulated directly for venous return and with a complete dissection including ligation of phrenic veins and the right adrenal vein, the entire liver is completely isolated.Ff\" The only connection that does not allow complete vascular control is the bile duct, and the amount of blood flow there is minimal. The initial trials of isolated hepatic perfusion reported recently used mitomycin C, which led to significant objective responses but were complicated by life-threatening venoocelusive disease, and this dose-limiting toxicity made this treatment impractical. lI 4 Even though melphalan is not an active agent against colorectal adenocarcinoma given systemically, because it is an excellent perfusion drug with outstanding tissue levels as seen with isolated limb perfusion it was utilized in isolated hepatic perfusion. A series of studies have evaluated isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan either in combination with tumor necrosis factor.J\" alone, or with additional intraarterial hepatic infusion with FUDR and leucovorin. The initial study was a mixed group of tumors treated with melphalan and tumor necrosis factor with a n % partial response rate and a 3 % complete response rate occurring in an ocular melanoma patient. Subsequent follow-up studies have shown the response rates are between 71 % and 77% for colorectal cancer, however, the median duration of response is 10 months! \" (Table 103 .12). The addition of post-isolated hepatic perfusion intraarterial FUDR did not appear to augment the response rate. Another tumor type that may be very appropriate for treatment with isolated hepatic perfusion is metastatic ocular melanoma. For unknown reasons, approximately 70% of patients with this tumor when it metastasizes have liver disease only. Furthermore, this tumor has been very resistant to treatment with standard agents that show benefit for cutaneous melanoma. A trial of melphalan isolated liver perfusion for ocular melanoma, showing a 10% complete response rate and a 52% partial response rate (see Table 103 .12). For patients who had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the mid-to low normal range, there was prolonged survival, but the overall duration of response was 9 months, this seemed to be greatly improved with the addition of tumor necrosis factor in the perfusate. Trials in Europe have generally reproduced these results in small series in the Netherlands and Germany. Typically, the response rates are in the range of 60% to 80% for melanoma, but the duration of response tends to be between 9 and II months. 1 16 In a recent report from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of nine patients with primary hepatoma, a partial response rate of 67% (six of nine) was reported with a median time to progres-~! l1 sion of 7.7 months. Because of the complexity of this procedure, it has not been widely accepted, and efforts to streamline the operation by use of percutaneous catheter techniques are being studied.I'\"",

This technique uses a percutaneous arterial catheter into the common hepatic artery.1l8 A double-balloon inferior vena cava catheter collects the hepatic venous effluent, and then this collected blood is recirculated externally into a large-bore cannula into the subclavian vein. Two significant problems exist with this percutaneous technique compared to the open isolated hepatic perfusion technique. First, the portal venous flow is not controlled, and therefore the majority of the blood coming through the liver does not contain chemotherapeutic drug and a large outflow from the hepatic veins is from this portal system. Second, the type of drug in the dose escalation is limited by the ability of the extracorporeal charcoal filter system to remove the agent before reinfusion into the subclavian vein. Technological limitations on this clearance at rapid flow rates limit the ability to significantly escalate the drug as can occur in isolated hepatic perfusion. Third, the isolated hepatic perfusion uses hyperthermia by heating the perfusate. Again, in this closed technique it would be technically impossible to successfully utilize hyperthermia to augment chemotherapy response. The initial use of this technique treated patients with 5-FU, adriamycin, or melphalan.':\" Although the procedure was technically possible, there were only limited objective responses of very short duration following this treatment. A recent phase I trial was reported using this type of technique from the group at the Surgery Branch at the NCI. A total of 74 percutaneous treatments were administered to 28 patients.':\" The drug used was melphalan initially at a dose of 2.0mgjkg, escalating up to 3.5mgjkg, with a treatment time of 30min. The dose-limiting toxicity, seen at 3.5mgjkg, was neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The radiographic response rate overall was 300/0, and in 10 patients with ocular melanoma a 500/0 overall response rate was seen with 200/0 (2 patients) having complete responses.l \" These results are much more promising than the earlier studies on this technique using other agents. This percutaneous technique is much less involved in terms of the technical aspects of the procedure than an open isolated hepatic perfusion performed surgically and allows retreatment. Further studies are needed to define the response rates in the patient population that will benefit from this regional treatment in light of the improved systemic therapies and alternative treatments for colorectal cancer. Perhaps this treatment may become a standard for the patient population with ocular melanoma who have limited alternative options.",

In a recent report of the NCI phase I trial of cisplatin with or without tumor necrosis factor with a median follow-up time of 12.3 months, the l-year survival rate was 49%. 130 Patients with colorectal carcinoma recurred at a median time interval of 3 months.

However, one could also interpret that the patients who achieved complete debulking had fairly nonaggressive tumors and may benefit from the surgical procedure alone as there has been no randomized trial comparing surgery alone in this patient population to surgery plus hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion.

Tumor is debulked to the maximum possible degree and then two large-bore catheters are placed, one in the upper abdomen and one in the pelvis.l\" The abdomen is filled with perfusate and the abdominal incision is closed. Multiple thermal probes are placed at various locations throughout the abdomen to monitor the temperature at those sites to ensure good distribution of treatment. The abdomen then is perfused with a volume of 2 and 6 L perfusate that is recirculated with an extracorporeal circuit with a pump and heater. The setpoint of the inflow temperature of the perfusate will define the maximally achieved temperature as read by the thermisters. During the perfusion, the abdomen is gently manipulated and the table is turned side to side to ensure even distribution. At the conclusion of the treatment interval, generally either 90 or 120min, the perfusate is washed out of the abdomen into a waste container. The abdomen is then reopened with removal of the thermisters and formal closure of the incision. Another key component in perfusing CHPP is to place ice around the extremities, chest, and head to prevent core body temperature arising to above 40\u00b0C. 135 This technique allows exposure to smallvolume disease or microscopic disease on peritoneal surfaces to high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agent that may be augmented by hyperthermia. The major disadvantage of CHPP, as for all other surgical regional therapies, is that this is limited to a single treatment. Some investigators leave intraperitoneal catheters behind at the time of surgery for additional postoperative treatment. However, shortly after an operation the formation of adhesions limits the utility of the indwelling cannulae.",

Instead of using chemotherapeutic agents augmented by hyperthermia, PDT uses a laser light treatment of all surface areas. The three components of photodynamic therapy that are essential for cytotoxicity are light and specific wavelength, a photosensitizer retained by tumor cells, and oxygen.\" When the photosensitizer is stimulated with the appropriate wavelength light, then the energy absorbed is transferred to oxygen, and oxygen-free radicals are generated that lead to cell death. One potential limitation of this treatment is the depth of penetration of the light, which is variable depending on the wavelength of light used for a given sensitizer, typically in the range of 3 to 5 mm. Although this is a disadvantage because larger nodules of disease cannot be treated, it has an advantage as it protects normal tissues from toxic effects. The theoretical selectivity of the antitumor effect with PDT after systemic photosensitizer administration is in selective uptake and retention of the photosensitizer within malignant cells to a greater degree than normal cells; this has been shown to be true for a variety of these porphyrin-derivative sensitizers that are retained in tumor and skin primaries for reasons that are not clear.v\" The time interval between administration of photosensitizers and light delivery varies depending on the pharmacokinetics of the specific photosensitizer that is used.

The results of this phase I trial were published\" and recently updated in abstract form.!\" In an initial report, 56 patients were entered and received photosensitizer. Two patients had no evidence of disease at operation and 15 patients had tumors that could not be debulked below 5 mm as required by the protocol. Therefore, only 39 patients were treated, including 21 with ovarian cancer, 12 with sarcomatosis, and 6 with gastrointestinal (GI) carcinomatosis. Nine of 39 patients remained disease free between 3 and 27 months later; 9 patients died of progressive tumor, and 21 were alive with disease with follow-up of approximately 1 year. Three patients with ovarian tumors were free of disease at 3, 4, IS, and 27 months after treatment. Three patients with GI tumors that were low-grade pseudomyxomas were free of disease at 8, 9, and 18 months, and 1 patient with sarcomatosis was free of disease at 20 months. 138 ,139 A phase II trial was designed based on these data utilizing photofrin given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg 48 h before debulking surgery. The inclusion criteria of this trial were disease confined to the peritoneal cavity with no evidence of hematogenous spread. To receive light treatments, the patient had to have tumors debulked down to 5 mm or smaller. Patients were divided into ovarian carcinomatosis, carcinomatosis from gastrointestinal tumors including stomach, pancreas, colon, and appendix, and sarcomatosis from gastrointestinal stromal tumors or retroperitoneal sarcomas. One hundred patients were entered in this trial, although only 71 could be debulked to a degree where light therapy was administered. All patients showed signs of recurrent disease typically within 3 to 4 months, but the median overall survival for this heavily pretreated population was 22.0 months for the ovarian carcinoma group, 13.2 months for the gastrointestinal group, and 21.9 months for the sarcoma group.l'\" Tissue analysis suggested that, particularly for gastrointestinal tumors and sarcomas, there was no detected retention of the photosensitizer within the tumor compared to normal tissue contributing to the early recurrences. However, the fairly prolonged median survival in the patient population that at entry was very heavily pretreated indicates some essential benefit for this difficult disease.",

The field has matured enough that individual investigators are now accumulating significant follow-up for specific types of cancer. The group at Wake Forest has reported studies evaluating experience with gastric cancer as well as colorectal cancer.'!' In 34 patients with gastric cancer treated with hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with mitomycin C for carcinomatosis and compared to a historical population, the overall survival rate was 11.2% versus 3.30/0, with a 2-year survival rate of 450/0 versus 80/0. 131 Again, this was not a randomized trial but a historical comparison against patients who have a very poor prognosis. This same group reported on 77 patients with colorectal cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis.132 In this patient group, the 2-year survival rate after tumor debulking and hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion was 250/0 and the 5year survival rate was 170/0. Bowel obstruction, malignant ascites, and incomplete debulking were all correlated with poor outcomes. The Loggie group has reported using hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with mitomycin in 109 patients with carcinomatosis. For patients who could have complete debulking of all gross tumor, the median survival was 15.5 months with a 5-year survival of 130/0. For patients who did not achieve complete debulking, the median survival was 7.9 months with a 2% 5-year survival.",
