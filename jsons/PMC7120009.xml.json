It is mainly used for prevention of the airborne disease from infecting both the environment outside the ward and the people except for the patient. These diseases include the tuberculosis, the chickenpox, the pneumonia, SARS, the hemorrhagic fever virus, etc.This book focuses on the negative pressure isolation ward only.Some infected patients may also need protection, such as tuberculosis patients.In occasions when there is no infectious patient inside, the isolation ward can be used as the ordinary ward. This has been clearly specified in the standard of some nations, such as the AIA standard in U.S.A. \u201cWhen there is no need for isolation, the isolation ward can be used as the ordinary nursing room or can be divided into individual isolation wards.\u201d \u201cWhen there is not patients with airborne diseases, the isolation ward can be used for patients without infectious diseases\u201d [1].The infectious strength of the disease on patient inside the infectious isolation ward can be classified as four levels which can be referred in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-2923-3_1.The function of the isolation ward is as follows:The isolation ward should play the role of isolation.Isolate the ward from the ambient environment, and isolate the patient from the medical personnel.The isolation ward should play the role of safety.To guarantee the safety of the environment outside the ward.To guarantee the safety of the medical personnel inside the ward.It could also be classified as four levels according to the required pressure difference, such as the Australian standard which is shown in Table 7.1 [2].\n\n\n",

Since the isolation ward is the main component of hospital, this principle should be followed naturally. The concept of the minimum distance 20 m was first proposed by author, which was adopted by the national standard GB 50346-2004 \u201cArchitectural and technical code for biosafety laboratories\u201d. This is aimed in terms of the risk of the exhaust air from the biosafety laboratories. When the microbes with highly pathogenic and the safety of the exhaust air are concerned, the isolation ward should not be an exceptional.In the general hospital, it is better if the isolation ward can be placed alone. Otherwise it should be set at one edge of the building as possible. If should form a zone and placed at the leeward wind side in the most annual wind direction in this area. When there are two most wind directions in this area, the isolation ward should be placed at the opposite direction facing the wind direction with the least frequency.\n",

The public corridor is the potentially polluted area. The primary changing room, the preparatory room and the offices for the medical personnel area the clean area.If there is enough space for setting double corridors, the patient should enter into the ward through the back corridor and the back door. In this case, the back corridor should be classified as the polluted area. The relative pressure inside the back corridor is positive. The net width of the corridor should be not less than 2.4 m. When there is relative height difference in the corridor, the barrier-free cohesion edge should be used, and the antiskid measures should be taken.The medical personnel should enter into the ward through the front corridor which should be classified as the potentially polluted area. Only the region outside the exit of this corridor could be classified as the clean area.Figure 7.1 shows the renovated SARS ward in a hospital in Shanghai, where the scheme with two corridors was adopted [2]. In the figure, the semi-clean area can be considered as the potentially polluted area. While the semi-polluted area can also be considered as the polluted area, where the pressure is slightly higher than that in the ward. Besides, buffer rooms should be set at two edges of this corridor.\nAs shown in Fig. 7.1, it is better if there is also the buffer room at the back door of the ward. In this case, it is unnecessary to set the buffer room at two edges of the exterior corridor which can be classified as the potentially polluted area.In the national standard GB50849-2014 \u201cCode for design of infectious diseases hospital\u201d, more than two passageways should be set for the ward in the hospital where the number of the sickbeds is more than 150, and two passageways are required to be set for the ward in the hospital where the number of the sickbeds is less than 150. The detailed information is given in Table 7.2 (Both Tables 7.2 and 7.3 are cited from the literature \u201cDiscussion on planning design of the infectious diseases hospital\u201d by Zhang Chun-yang and Huang Kai-xin). The items 2 and 3 in the table are united.\n\nIf the ward is placed in other buildings, the passageway must be set independently, which could be disinfected in a closed space.According to the different transmission routes of the infectious diseases, the ward and the outpatient room (or the emergency room) in the hospital are set. The ward with infectious disease by airborne transmission must be set independently, which is shown in Table 7.3.\n",

The delivery window set between the isolation ward and the polluted area should be Type B1 or C1. Figure 7.2 shows the basic appearance of the delivery window.\n\nAir shower should not be placed along the passage of people flow. Air curtain should not be used at the gate in the ward area.The ordinary vertical hinged door or the upper suspended sliding door can be used between the isolation ward and the buffer room. The vertical hinged door is suitable to be set between the buffer room and the corridor. In both cases, the wooden door should not be used.When it is possible, the advantage is more obvious if the sliding door is adopted between the isolation ward and the buffer room. In this case, the velocity of the induced turbulence by the sliding door is the minimum, compared with that of the vertical hinged door. Therefore, the sliding door is recommended for the entrance of the isolation ward in related standards in Japan. This is also recommended in AIA standard in U.S.A. and it is also pointed out that the sliding slot should not be set on the floor for this kind of the sliding door. Therefore the upper suspected sliding door should be used, which is the same as that of the clean operating room. Of course, whether the sliding door can be set depends on the space of the buffer room. The gap of the vertical hinged door is small, so it should be used between the buffer room and the corridor, which is suggested in Japanese standard.It is not necessary to use the air-tight door and the air-tight inter-lock door for the doors of the isolation ward and the buffer room. The requirement can be met when the ordinary door is used. But the wooden door should not be used.Except for the safety door and the door towards the entrance hall which open outwardly, other doors should open towards the side with larger pressure.Door should not be placed for other bathrooms outside of the ward. Instead, the open labyrinth-style inlet used in the airport terminal building can be adopted.Buffer room is placed outside of the isolation ward.

            "text": "\nThere was objection opinion for the usage of air conditioning system in the isolation ward during the early epidemic of SARS in China. Because of the incognizance of SARS, for the purpose of the emergency response, it was emphasized in the \u201cDesign Highlights for Hospital Buildings Receiving SARS Infected Patients\u201d issued by the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China that the ventilation condition is accessible to all the areas. Central air conditioning system is prohibited in all the areas. Air exhaust unit can be installed for the simple-built negative pressure ward.It is understandable that these provisional measures were specified. But during the East Asia Rainy Season (or Meiyu Season) and the hot summer in the southern region where the humidity is extremely large, the propagation of pathogenic microbes indoors cannot be prevented in hospitals by natural ventilation alone. In this case, the microbial contamination may still occur. If the temperature and the humidity indoors are very high, the patient will generate heat and sweat, which will increase the bacterial generation rate. When the medical personnel wear the insulation garment, the protective cloth, the mask and eyeglasses, sweating will occur soon after the work. Sometimes febrile disease may even appear. Especially in the isolation ward for SARS, the working environment will be worsened if the problem of HVAC and environmental control is not solved. This will influence the physical and mental health of the medical personnel.In June of 2003, the WHO representative office in China wrote to Ministry of Health of China. Different opinion was proposed. Natural ventilation by window opening is not allowed in the isolation ward for SARS. The HVAC system should be operated continuously. Exhaust air fan should be installed on the exterior window or the exterior wall, so that negative pressure is maintained indoors.However, the \u201cHospital infection control guidance for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\u201d issued by WHO pointed out that when there is no independent air exhaust system in HVAC system, the air conditioning system can be turned off, and ventilation can be provided by window opening. But windows are prohibited to be open towards the public space.In fact, air conditioning system is not prohibited in related foreign standards. And circulation air can be adopted conditionally.In \u201cGuidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities\u201d issued by CDC from U.S.A. in 1994, it was emphasized that for the known airborne infectious droplet nuclei, the general exhaust system can be adopted. Meanwhile, it was pointed out that it was inevitable to adopt the scheme of recirculation air. When HEPA filter is used, air can be re-circulated. Three kinds of air distribution were proposed, which would be introduced in the next section. It was also pointed out in \u201cThe guideline of design and management for air-conditioning system of Hospital\u201d by Healthcare Engineering Association of Japan that the fan unit with HEPA filter can be installed in the isolation ward.In March 1st of 2003, novel idea for central air conditioning system appeared in \u201cCode for hygiene of central air-conditioning ventilation system in public places\u201d published by ministry of health of China. It was specified that when the epidemic of airborne disease occurs in the local area, the central air conditioning system can be operated continuously only when the following requirements are satisfied. It can be used when the full fresh air scheme is used. It can also be used when the air cleaning device with disinfection function is installed and its performance is guaranteed to be effective. It can also be used when independent ventilation is accessible to each room when the HVAC system scheme by the combination of the fan coil unit and the outdoor air is adopted. However, this solution is obviously not enough. It should be pointed out that for the isolation ward with infectious disease, except for the full fresh air system, air can be circulated only when HEPA filter is installed (at the return air grille). Of course, no matter whether full fresh air system is used, exhaust air must pass through HEPA filter.For the infectious diseases hospital and isolation ward, the above idea is also applicable.But different cleaning air conditioner system should be set for the clean area, the potentially polluted area and the polluted area, respectively.The air-circulation system is only suitable for the single ward with infectious disease. Or circulation of indoor air is adopted for the ward receiving multiple people with the same kind of disease. When heating and cooling are provided by fan coil unit, another independent or public outdoor air supply system should be set. In this case, it is suitable to switch to or adopt the full fresh air system for one or more wards.\n",

In other auxiliary rooms, the air change rate should be 6\u201310 h\u22121.Although there is no requirement on the air cleanliness level in the isolation ward, air filtration device with low pressure drop and efficiency larger than the high and medium efficiency air filter shown in Table 10.1007/978-981-10-2923-3_3(1), (2) must be installed at the air supply opening. HEPA filter should be installed for the supplied air into the buffer room where the air change rate is \u226560 h\u22121.The safely demountable leakage-free high efficiency negative pressure air exhaust device sealed with dynamic air current can be used in the isolation ward and its bathroom.The outlet of the air exhaust pipeline should be linked towards outdoors. The check valve and the rain droplet prevention measures should be used. The end of the air exhaust pipeline should be above the roof by more than 2 m. It should be far away from the air intake opening on the wall by more than 20 m, and it should be located in the downstream of the air intake opening. When the distance between them is less than 20 m, the retaining fence should be set.The cleaning air conditioning system should be operated for 24 h continuously. The air velocity of the supplied air in the daytime should not be less than 0.13 m/s. While in the evening, the flow rate is under the low gear station, and the velocity of the supplied air should not be larger than 0.15 m/s. The air supply and air exhaust should be inter-locked. The air exhaust system should be turned on at first and closed later.In the ordinary time, the cleaning air conditioning system can provide normal pressure status in the isolation ward, when the non-infectious patients are received. But the pressure conversion scheme is not allowed in the infectious isolation ward and the protective isolation ward. This has also been specified in the related standards in Japan and U.S.A.In the isolation ward where cleaning air conditioning system and air circulation system with HEPA filter are used, indoor air cleaning device should not be used again to disturb the original air distribution.Air cleaning device must be installed at the entrance of the outdoor air. According to national standard GB51039-2014 \u201cCode for design of general hospital\u201d, two-stage air filters including the coarse and fine filters should be installed at least for the entrance of the outdoor air, when the annual concentration of respirable particulate matter PM10 in the atmosphere does not exceed 0.10 mg/m3. When it exceeds 0.10 mg/m3, the high and medium efficiency air filter should be added.In European standard EN13779, it is also specified that when the outdoor air is clean, two-stage air filters such as F5 + F7 should be set for the outdoor air pipeline.It is also specified in ISO 16814 that G4 + F7 should be set for outdoor air. It is better to set F5 + F8. It is very good to set F7 + F9.According to GB51039-2014 \u201cCode for design of general hospital\u201d, for the return air grille in the HVAC system in the auxiliary room for isolation ward area, air filters with initial pressure drop less than 50 Pa, the one-pass penetration for microbes not larger than 10% and the one-pass arrestance for particles not larger than 5% should be installed.\n",

The sequence for the extent of negative pressure is the bathroom, the negative pressure isolation ward, the buffer room, and the interior corridor. For the ordinary negative pressure isolation ward, at least one buffer room should be set outside the ward based on the actual condition.For the buffer room between the corridor inside or in front of the potentially polluted area and the clean area, its pressure relative to both this corridor and outdoor should be positive. The relative positive pressure between the buffer room and the region connecting the ambient should not be less than 10 Pa.Because the ward and its bathroom are polluted areas and there is usually exhaust air system in the bathroom, the air must flow from the ward towards the bathroom. From the viewpoint of principle of dynamic isolation with dynamic current, the value of pressure difference between the ward and the bathroom was not given in DB11/663-2009. Instead, it was required for the directional airflow from the ward towards the bathroom. By adjusting the exhaust air volume, the degree of negative pressure in the bathroom should be higher than that in the ward. Upward shutter can be set above the door of the bathroom.For the isolation ward with extreme high risk, two negative pressure buffer rooms can be set in series at the gate of the ward. In Japanese standard, this suggestion has been proposed. The gradient of the pressure difference is: Ward---- \u2190 Buffer room (1)--- \u2190 Buffer room (2)--- \u2190 Interior corridor \u2192 \u2190Buffer room (3)(+ or \u2212)--\u2194Clean area (+ or 0).\n",

            "text": "\nCompared with the atmospheric pressure, the relative pressure inside each room is marked in the frame as shown in Fig. 7.13.\nCompared with the pressure in the adjacent room, the direction of the pressure difference is expressed with the arrow at the gate connecting two rooms. The value of the pressure difference is marked beside the arrow or at the end of the arrow. Take the above figure as an example, Fig. 7.13 can be obtained. In Fig. 7.13, the value \u201c\u221210 Pa\u201d means the pressure difference between the room where the arrow starts and the room where the arrow points to is \u221210 Pa. The value \u201c+5 Pa\u201d means the pressure difference between the room where the tail of the arrow starts and the room where the arrow points to is +5 Pa. Therefore, both the value of the pressure difference and the location cannot be confused.It is shown in Figs. 7.13 and 7.14 that these two kinds of expression methods are different.\nIn terms of the pressure difference itself, it is aimed to prevent the leakage from adjacent room or the outward leakage towards adjacent room. Because the room studied is connected with the adjacent room, the pressure difference between them is meaningful.However, it has no practical implication to discuss the leakage towards the ambient air through the envelope or the inward leakage from the ambient air towards indoors. The biosafety laboratory with high class level is an exceptional.In the layout shown in Fig. 7.15, it is required that:\nThe absolute value of negative pressure in room A \u2206P\nAO \u226e 40 Pa.The absolute value of negative pressure in corridor B \u2206P\nBO \u226e 30 Pa.If all the measured data are \u221240 Pa, the pressure in corridor B does not violate the original requirement. But in fact there is no relative pressure difference between A and B. The design or adjusting results are not reasonable.Figure 7.16 shows another example. The differential pressure gauge only set on the partition wall between the isolation ward and the polluted corridor, which shows the relative pressure difference between them. Inspection shows that there is no differential pressure gauge between the isolation ward and the buffer room, but the actual pressure difference is 0. In this case, even though the pressure difference between the isolation ward and the polluted corridor meets the requirement, there is no pressure difference between the isolation ward and the buffer room. The buffer room and the isolation ward is combined to be one unit. The function of buffer loses, so the buffer room only exists as a name.\nIt has been mentioned before that it is difficult to control with the absolute pressure during the actual adjusting process. If one side of the differential pressure sensor connects indoors while the other connects outdoors as shown in Fig. 7.17, the sampled pressure difference is unstable because of the wind direction and wind magnitude of the atmosphere. It may be positive or negative, large or small.\nIn fact, during the process of system design, the flow rate by negative pressure or positive pressure is calculated based on the relative pressure difference. Figure 7.13 should be expressed as Fig. 7.18. The difference of the exhaust air volume from A and that from B can be calculated. The difference of the exhaust air volume from B and that from the exterior corridor can also be calculated. This has been introduced in Sect. 10.1007/978-981-10-2923-3_2.\nBased on the relative pressure, the corresponding absolute pressure difference relative to atmospheric pressure can be converted. The conversion equation is as follows:7.2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta P_{{0,{\\text{n}}}} = ( \\pm\\Delta P_{\\text{n}} ) + ( \\pm\\Delta P_{{{\\text{n}} - 1}} ) + ( \\pm\\Delta P_{{{\\text{n}} - 2}} ) + \\cdots + ( \\pm\\Delta P_{ 1} )$$\\end{document}\u0394P0,n=(\u00b1\u0394Pn)+(\u00b1\u0394Pn-1)+(\u00b1\u0394Pn-2)+\u22ef+(\u00b1\u0394P1)where \u2206P\n0,n is the absolute pressure difference at room n.

Every two wards share the same anterior buffer room. Each ward has its posterior buffer room. Moreover, buffer room is placed at all the entrance and exit. This realizes the feature of \u201cThree-Area-Two-Buffer\u201d. Three-Area means the clean, the potentially polluted and the polluted areas. Two-Buffer means the buffer room between the ward and the corridor, and the buffer room between the corridor and outdoors. The isolation capability is greatly increased. Independent air conditioning system is used for each area. In the clean area, the scheme with the fan coil unit and the dedicated outdoor air handling unit is used. In the potentially polluted area, the dedicated all air system is used. In the polluted area, independent all air system is adopted for every isolation ward, which operates with two gears of velocity. In other regions, an independent all air system is adopted.The air change rates in the ward and the buffer room are 12 and 60 h\u22121, respectively.The gradient of the pressure is also marked in Fig. 7.26.Simplified analysisCorridors are set in front and back of the ward, which realizes the separation of clean and dirty matter.Buffer rooms are set in front and back of the ward. Buffer rooms are also set between the corridor and outdoors. These greatly increase the isolation performance and safety. By adapted to local conditions, there is no obvious occupation of floor area. Positive pressure should be kept in the buffer room 4.The ward is set at one side, while the auxiliary rooms are set at the other side. The arrangement is uniform, which is good for usage and pollution control.The opening direction for the door of the anterior should be opposite, since the pressure in the anterior is higher than that in the ward.Air supply outlet should be placed on the ceiling above the middle of the two beds in the double-bed ward, which is beneficial to control the dispersion of pollutant.Since the leakage-free negative pressure high efficiency air exhaust device is installed at the return air grille, the return air can be switched on. Because the bacterial removal efficiency of the HEPA filter on the return air grille reaches more than 99.9999% and there is no leakage on the frame of air filter, one bacterium in the return air can penetrate through only when the indoor bacterial concentration reaches millions per cubic meter or even tens of millions per cubic meter. But the probability of this incidence is extremely small.For the installation style of the fan coil unit on the ceiling, the problem for the accumulation and removal of condensation water once occurred should be solved.\n",
