            "text": "In light of the recent outbreak of human H7N9 influenza cases in China [1], concerns of an influenza pandemic have again been heightened. Emerging infections, once they arise, can spread rapidly around the world via international travel, as was the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2], [3], [4]. Travellers are an important vector in the global spread of infectious diseases, especially during outbreaks. Historically, China has been a major source of emerging infectious diseases of international concern [5]. The easing of government-imposed travel restrictions has resulted in a rapid expansion of international travel to and from China over the last decade. In 2012, outbound Chinese were the largest tourist source nation and China ranked third in the number of inbound tourist arrivals, and is expected to receive the largest number of international arrivals by 2020 [6]. With this high and increasing volume of cross-border movements, the global spread of infectious diseases from China warrants consideration.",

The risk of infectious disease and subsequent importation of disease is greater in travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travellers [7], [8], [9]. VFR travellers commonly acquire similar infectious diseases as do other travellers [10], but they may be especially at risk for certain diseases [11]. Whilst there is no standard definition of a VFR traveller, the term most commonly refers to both first and second generation immigrants who are ethnically distinct from the majority population of their country of residence, who return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives [12], [13]. The term generally refers to those travelling from high income to lower income countries [12] where their risk of infectious diseases are greater [7], [8], [9]. A range of factors related to higher risk of exposure and lower uptake of preventative health measures contribute to the higher risk in VFR travellers [11]. While there are no data on the travel patterns and travel health practices of Chinese VFR travellers, evidence suggests that the proportion of Asian travellers seeking pre-travel health information is lower than that of Western travellers [14], [15], [16].",

Globally, international travel for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives accounted for a quarter of international tourist arrivals in 2012 [6], particularly originating from Western countries [18], [19]. In 2011, 46% of outbound international travel by US residents was to visit friends and relatives [18], whilst the main purpose of travel for 23% of Australian resident departures in 2012 was for the purpose of 'visiting friends and relatives' [19]. Ethnic Chinese are one of the largest cultural groups in many Western countries including Australia [20], Canada [21] and the USA [22] and was the largest source country for migration to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2011 [23]. In Australia, travel to mainland China and Hong Kong accounts for a significant proportion of all overseas travel. Of resident Australian departures in 2010, 4.7% were to mainland China and 3.0% were to Hong Kong [24], of those 28.9% were for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives [25]. Chinese VFR travellers contribute substantially to the volume of travel to China from Australia and other Western countries.",

Able to efficiently spread between humans, the SARS virus resulted in a pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality [2]. The SARS coronavirus was of zoonotic origin [29] and Chinese wet markets were likely to have played an important role in the emergence of SARS. A similar virus was isolated in civet cats and racoon dogs in wet markets in Guangdong province during the pandemic [30]. After the initial spread from mainland China to Hong Kong, air travel was central to the global spread of the SARS virus. As with other outbreaks of newly emerged pathogens, infection control measures early in the pandemic were hampered by the lack of knowledge of the virus [31]. As a result, those countries with importations via international travel early in the pandemic, before the virus could be properly identified and proper control measures were in place, observed the highest number of cases outside China, including Canada, Singapore and Vietnam [32], [33]. VFR travel also played an important role in the SARS pandemic. The index case of SARS in Canada was a VFR traveller [34]. SARS demonstrated the importance of travellers in national disease control efforts aiming to prevent or delay the introduction of an emerging infectious disease and future pandemic planning. Part of that effort needs to be directed at VFR travellers and their role in spreading emerging infectious diseases across international borders.",

In January 2014, there was a spike in cases (at least 95 cases in this month compared to 144 cases in the whole of 2013) but associated with a lower death rate [35]. The reason for this is currently unclear. Sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9 has not been documented [35], but efficient human-to-human transmission through further mutations or reassortment is a possibility [36], with H7 viruses having tendencies towards genetic promiscuity [37].

Whilst H5N1 is more often acquired via close and high-risk contact with birds, H7N9 appears to be often acquired via only incidental contact [50]. For unknown reasons, whilst H7N9 avian influenza has mainly affected older individuals, especially those over 60 years of age [39], [40], [43], H5N1 avian influenza has more often affected younger individuals [43], [51], especially those under 18 years of age [52].

In addition, there have been reports of H10N8 infections in China recently [54]. Since so many different avian influenza subtypes have been able to infect humans directly, it must now be assumed that all subtypes of influenza viruses, including H1-15 and N1-9, have the potential to become the new pandemic strain [49]. This new view of pandemic influenza means that there is now a much larger pool of precursor influenza viruses that may trigger a pandemic and the threat of avian influenza outbreaks in humans is ever-present. Awareness of the risk of highly pathogenic influenza should be raised amongst VFR travellers to China and agencies and professionals dealing with such travellers. Health professionals who may treat returned Chinese VFR travellers should also be well informed regarding the latest outbreaks, so that prompt diagnosis may be made in returning travellers.",

            "text": "The SARS, H5N1 and H7N9 pandemics have all originated in South-eastern China (see Fig. 1). It has been hypothesized that Southern China is an epicentre for the emergence of new, pandemic causing viruses [5], [55], [56]. There are various reasons for this, including farming practices, close proximity of humans and livestock, and food preferences in Chinese culture [5]. Practices potentially encouraging the development and spread of new strains of influenza and other viruses include duck farming on flooded rice fields close to human housing, live poultry markets and wet markets, and the sale and consumption of exotic meats including snakes and civet cats, all potential sources of a range of zoonotic pathogens [5]. These are all long-held cultural practices, deeply embedded in Chinese history and culture [5]. Various provincial and local governments in China have attempted to make changes to these practices, such as requiring enhanced disinfection and regular closure of wet markets to mitigate risks [57], [58]. Whilst these measures may be somewhat effective [57], they may not significantly reduce the risks. For example, the Hong Kong government has ordered that certain animals including ducks, quail and geese be excluded from wet markets, and that all markets be simultaneously emptied and cleaned twice a month. However, even this has not been effective in keeping H5N1 out of wet markets [58]. Radical changes like permanently closing all wet markets are not generally considered a practical option. Banning the sale of live poultry, as practiced in Beijing, may not be effective, as illegal live poultry trade has continued [59]. As these measures have been implemented regionally rather than nationally, their effectiveness may also be further limited. With the continued potential source of zoonotic pathogens remaining, Southern China will continue to be a source for the emergence of epidemics in humans. Outbreak awareness, and awareness of respiratory infection control procedures in the event of a new outbreak arising during travel, should therefore be important components of pre-travel advice and education for Chinese VFR travellers.",

Wet markets, where live poultry and other animals are slaughtered and sold to the public, are visited daily by large numbers of people and are common across China. Wet markets provide an ideal environment for the emergence of new pathogens. Numerous species of live and slaughtered animals are kept in close proximity to each other and to humans, promoting genetic reassortment and recombination between pathogens originating from different species and are easily transmitted to humans, who are also present in great numbers at the markets [60]. Frequenting live poultry markets is not likely a common activity for travellers to China for the purpose of holiday or business. However, VFR travellers are more likely to have close contact with the local population, use local facilities and eat local food [17], compared to other travellers.

A 2012 study in five provinces affected by malaria in central China found that the incidence rate for each province was 0.05 per 100,000 or less [71]. The malaria species found in China is primarily Plasmodium vivax, with P. falciparum common in select locations [72] with evidence of resistance to chloroquine and mefloquine [72]. There are no known reports of malaria in VFR travellers returning from China, and GeoSentinel Surveillance data between 1998 to November 2007 report no cases of malaria amongst travellers to China [73]. Despite this, the risk remains and chemoprophylaxis should be used by travellers to malarious areas in Hainan, Yunnan, Anhui, Guizhou, Henan, and Hubei provinces, with recommended regimens reflecting known drug resistance. Mosquito avoidance measures alone are recommended for travellers to all other malarious areas [72].",

There have been no studies on travel patterns and traveller behaviour in this population. A greater understanding of Chinese VFR traveller risk perceptions and behaviours are required to inform the control of travel-associated infectious diseases. Travellers play a significant role in the spread of infectious diseases across international borders and responsible travel through preventative practices and behaviour modification is crucial to the comprehensive control of infectious diseases on a global scale.
