Monitoring of microorganisms in water therefore involves the use of different techniques including the use of indicator and index bacteria such as faecal coliforms [4]. Examples of faecal indicators include Escherichia coli, Enterococci [5], Bacteroidetes spp. [4], Candida spp. [6], adenoviruses and polyomaviruses [7]. However, the reliability of these indicators is questioned. The quantity of indicator microorganisms may differ from the actual number of pathogens [8], infectious doses between the microorganisms may vary [8] and in some cases the microorganisms are viable but nonculturable [9]. Microbial source tracking indicators are for example useful for pinpointing pollution sources of groundwater, used as a drinking water supply.",

This is accomplished through the monitoring of fluorescently labelled PCR products [13, 14]. The methods of quantitation of the amplicons and type of standard used in the assay determine the strategy for qPCR. Different approaches include the use of internal and external standards for competitive or non-competitive assays, respectively [15]. Two methods are used for qPCR, namely end-point PCR and real-time PCR. During end-point PCR a measurement is taken after completion of the entire PCR reaction to calculate the amount of template present prior to PCR. Real-time PCR takes measurements at the exponential phase of the PCR and is a more sensitive and reproducible method [16]. Different protocols exist for real-time PCR, including relative qPCR and absolute measurements, and small differences in variables may influence the final accumulation and quality of PCR products [17].",

This single-stranded cDNA serves as the target during PCR amplification. This technique is referred to as RT-PCR and is used for the detection of enteric viruses containing RNA genomes [18, 19]. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR) has been used to detect and quantify enteric viruses in environmental water sources. This method can also be used to measure low levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in samples of a small volume, for the comparison of mRNA levels in different samples, characterization of patterns in mRNA expression and discrimination between closely related mRNAs [20]. Messenger RNA is only present in viable organisms and can therefore be used to discriminate between viable and non-viable organisms [21].",

This virus was also observed to be present in wastewater in higher densities than other enteric viruses [38\u201340] and has been detected more often in environmental water sources than other enteric viruses [41, 42]. Recently it was shown that human adenoviruses can persist, for extensive time periods, in natural environmental conditions [43, 44]. The fact that adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses is related to their prolonged persistence in environmental water sources compared to single-stranded RNA viruses [45, 46]. Polyomaviruses are also double-stranded DNA viruses and have been investigated as a possible viral indicator for monitoring water quality [47, 48].",

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever caused by S. typhi and S. paratyphi respectively are responsible for 17 million cases annually. Humans can be carriers of Salmonella spp. even after recovery from typhoid fever because small numbers of the bacteria can persist [62]. Epidemic cholera is caused by the serogroups V. cholerae O1 and O39 that produce the cholera toxin. Cholera is associated with watery diarrhoea and if left untreated could lead to rapid dehydration and death in 50\u201370 % of the cases [63]. C. jejuni, C. coli, pathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli strains, and Y. enterocolitica are all agents for diarrhoea [61]. Legionella spp. are opportunistic human pathogens that proliferate in warm waters which support the growth of certain serogroups. These serogroups, once aerosolised, can be inhaled by humans resulting in subsequent legionnaires\u2019 disease and Pontaic fever [64].",

However, in cultured cells, the quantity of total RNA produced is determined by comparing with an internal control for example expression of a reference gene or with a calibrator sample [12]. Reference genes include endogenous [76] or exogenous [77] mRNA targets that are assayed separately or together with the unknown target followed by the evaluation of the final ratio [78]. The two genes should be analysed in the same PCR assay to improve the reliability of the method [12]. The calibration sample is used to evaluate a biological effect in terms of per cent variation in comparison to a basal condition. The main approach is to determine the changes in gene expression by varying the experimental conditions in in vitro studies [12]. In this case the difficult process to develop accurate RNA standards is avoided by using a comparative quantification method. The method is based on the fact that the difference in threshold cycles between the target gene and the housekeeping gene is proportional to the relative gene expression level of the target gene [73].",

Conventional procedures are used to separate the PCR amplicons and the signal of the specific target is then compared to the known concentration of the internal standard. The most accurate procedure is to add a known amount of the competitor to each assay tube to ensure the amplification of the two species at the same rate. After amplification, the nucleic acid target and competitor are separated analytically to evaluate the ratio between the two species. This final ratio reveals the ratio between the target and competitor in the initial sample [17].",

Different methods exist to synthesise competitors to distinguish them from the target template. Examples are the inclusion of a new restriction site in the native sequence [80] and insertion of a slightly modified nucleotide sequence [82]. However, a simpler method is to modify the size of the competitor in the range of 10\u201315 % by introducing a short deletion or insertion. The amplification rate of the PCR will thereby not be modified [12].

In real-time PCR quantification takes place early, in the exponential amplification phase of the reaction.

During a PCR cycle, the probe specifically hybridises to the corresponding template, cleaves via the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase and subsequently increases the FAM fluorescent emission [108]. The increase in fluorescence is proportional to the amount of specific PCR product as the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase acts only if the fluorogenic probe is annealed to the target [12] (Fig. 1). The TaqMan assay can be applied for end-point and real-time measurements of PCR products. End-point measurements are only for qualitative applications i.e. presence or absence of a nucleic acid target. In real-time PCR, the fluorescence spectra are continuously measured during PCR amplification by a sequence detector [12, 13].\n",

Although it is easy to use it binds non-specifically to any dsDNA and makes the quantification of low copy numbers difficult [110]. It prevents the need for target-specific fluorescent probes and the same PCR master mix can be used for many genes of interest [16]. However, the disadvantage of using SYBR Green I is the occurrence of false positives. It is important to carefully optimise PCR conditions and the design of the primers and to prevent contamination from genomic DNA [16].\n",

Complementary stem sequences are on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the probe with the fluorophore in the immediacy of the quencher [71]. After amplification and incorporation of the hairpin probe, the loop sequence of the resultant amplicon is complementary to the probe. During each cycle of denaturation and annealing, the probe is free to bind to the complementary sequence, leading to the separation of the fluorophore and quencher and resulting in an increase in fluorescence. The PCR stopper in the hairpin prevents the stem-loop structure from being copied during PCR by extension from the other primer [71].",

The number of microorganisms to be monitored in potable and surface waters may be below the detection limit of qPCR. Therefore the microorganisms are normally concentrated by membrane filtration to a detectable number [35]. Tangential-flow, hollow-fibre ultrafiltration has recently showed promising results in concentrating pathogens in one process [112, 113]. Viruses in water samples from wastewater treatments plants have been concentrated through centrifugation steps before the re-dissolved pellets are filtered [23]. Viruses in water samples can be extracted by using glass wool columns [7], pre-acidified glass wool columns [114], ultrafiltration cartridges [115], electropositive cartridges [47] and ultracentrifugation [35]. The first two methods are the most cost-effective with acceptable recoveries of viruses, whereas electropositive cartridges have higher cost and cannot be used for turbid water samples and ultracentrifugation is only applicable for small volumes of heavily polluted water [7]. DNA can be extracted by a variety of DNA kits in combination with bead beating depending on the tested microorganism [4, 24]. Cell lysates can also successfully be used with the same reproducibility of purified DNA and involves less labour [11]. The genomic segment(s) to be amplified is (are) then selected and the optical tubes containing the reaction mixtures are subjected to thermal cycles that vary between 1 h and 15 min to 2 h and 45 min [6, 22, 24, 69, 116]. The amplified genomic segment(s) is (are) then detected and quantified by using specific protocols [36] (Tables 1 and 2). To determine the presence of inhibitors, the tested water sample is autoclaved and a pure culture of the test organism is cultured and inoculated into the water sample [117].\n\n",

The population ratio of Enterococcus and Candida spp. can serve as an early warning system for faecal contamination over time to indicate the need to change supply of water. Drug resistance in yeasts is increasing and it may be important to monitor the changes in yeast population of faecal origin regularly [6]. Brinkman et al. [6] developed a qPCR method to accurately identify six Candida spp. in different water sources. Untreated effluent and stormwater run-off into the ocean increases the risk of pathogenic Candida spp. on beaches. Quantitative PCR was used to analyse these water samples on the same day to eliminate the possible risk of infection [6].",

High numbers of Bacteriodetes are found in faeces and serve as a potential faecal indicator. Reischer et al. [4, 24] developed a qPCR assay to detect human-specific and ruminant-specific Bacteriodetes markers (BacH and BacR) in spring water in alpine karstic regions. The BacH assay could detect human faeces as low as 100 pg per volume of water. The detection limit of the BacR assay was 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 g per analysed filter. The assay met the requirements for MST in the alpine karstic spring water and was used to pinpoint the source of pollution. The use of qPCR assays can therefore assist in determining critical control points from source to tap to ensure safe drinking water. It is also a tool for quantitative microbial risk assessment and forms part of the World Health Organization (WHO) water safety plan recommendations [24].",

The advantage of molecular techniques is that the results are obtained within a shorter time period. The USA is therefore considering the application of qPCR for the rapid identification of indicator bacteria, such as faecal bacteria, as a national water quality metric [118]. Traditional methods used for the detection of E. coli O157:H7, a bacterial pathogen in water, takes about 3 to 5 days. An alternative method is the use of PCR assays although other pathogenic or non-pathogenic E. coli strains are also detected. A method is therefore required that would ideally be rapid and specific for the viable and stressed pathogenic isolates of E. coli O157:H7. Sen et al. [119] developed a culture-qPCR assay to detect stressed E. coli O157:H7 in source and finished drinking water. The assay takes 24 h from collection to detection and entails an enrichment step to allow growth of stressed cells followed by two triplex qPCR assays.",

Quantitative PCR was compared to EPA Method 1600 membrane filter (MF) analysis to measure the faecal pollution indicator genus Enterococcus at two recreational beaches during the summer of 2003 [25]. The qPCR method showed similar results and could therefore replace the MF method [25]. These results were confirmed in a study that investigated the relationship between qPCR and culturing techniques in the detection of Enterococcus spp. in surface water collected from 37 sites [120]. A linear relationship between the two techniques was observed at high levels of contamination [120]. The reproducibility of qPCR in the detection of the faecal bacteria, Enterococcus and Bacteroidales, was compared between eight different facilities, including the US EPA [118]. Only small variations in results between the laboratories were observed [118]. A qPCR assay for the rapid identification of Bacteroides fragilis has also been developed to indicate faecal pollution in recreational waters [121]. A higher relative error in replicate qPCR assays was observed than during replicate culturing techniques. This emphasizes the need to further optimise qPCR assays for routine analysis of environmental samples, taking into account sample variability, different pollution sources and environmental factors [120]. The relationship between gastrointestinal illnesses among swimmers and the presence of Enterococcus spp. in surface water has been well established with qPCR in fresh [122, 123] and marine water beaches [124] and can assist authorities in preventing potential disease outbreaks in public recreational areas.",

The drawback of this method is that viability is based only on membrane integrity. The efficiency of viable qPCR methods utilizing EMA and PMA dyes in the detection of bacteria in wastewater samples before and after chlorination treatment has been investigated. After disinfection, qPCR results were not comparable with results obtained with cultivation methods. The researchers suggested that EMA could not penetrate some of the cells in the chlorinated samples [127, 153]. EMA-qPCR assays to detect viable Legionella species in spa water [154], tap water [155] and cooling water [156] have also been developed. EMA-qPCR was more suited for quantifying viable microorganisms because PMA-qPCR led to an overestimation of viable Legionella species in cooling water samples. Important factors to consider during quantifying viable organisms are the determination of the optimal concentration of EMA and exposure time [156].",

One major limitation that hinders the implementation of qPCR for the use in environmental water analysis is that the qPCR signal does not decrease after common disinfection methods. In other words, as previously discussed, it cannot discriminate between viable and non-viable microorganisms. The EA and academic institutions compared the efficiency of conventional faecal indicators with the accredited EA qPCR method to determine whether the data obtained from this qPCR method could be solely used for making regulatory decisions. Crude sewage, secondary treated sewage and UV-disinfected sewage were collected from Scarborough Wastewater Treatment Works and analysed using both methods. After UV treatment a significant decrease in the colony forming units (CFU) of faecal coliforms and presumptive intestinal enterococci was observed. However, no significant decrease was observed in the genome copies of Bacteroidales after UV treatment (Fig. 4). Researchers therefore advise that qPCR cannot be used as the sole detection method for routine analysis of environmental water samples [168].\n",

Autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis is performed by the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment [170]. The products synthesised after amplification include stem-loop DNA structures with many inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structure with multiple loops [171]. The advantages of LAMP include a single reaction temperature ranging between 60 and 65 \u00b0C, high specificity by using six primers that can recognise eight distinct regions and lack of DNA purification due to tolerance to inhibitory materials [172\u2013174]. Detection of the products is visually assessed as a large amount of DNA is synthesised in a short time resulting in the production of pyrophosphate that forms white precipitates of magnesium pyrophosphate leading to turbidity [175]. An increase in turbidity indicates an increase in precipitate production and correlates with the amount of DNA [172, 174]. The method is therefore cost-effective as expensive equipment is not necessary [172, 176, 177]. LAMP products have been detected in research studies by using gel electrophoresis, real-time turbidimetry and fluorescence probes [178, 179]. Pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli [172], C. coli, C. jejuni [174], S. aureus [176], Salmonella [177], H. pylori [180], Shigella [181] and V. cholerae [174] have been detected in water samples by LAMP assays.",

This technology has been used in biological wastewater treatment systems to analyse the microbial community [197] and in the MST of pathogens in coastal urban watershed [198]. Another novel tool that has emerged in the detection of waterborne pathogens is pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing is based on the sequencing-by-synthesis principle that utilizes enzyme-coupled reactions and bioluminescence to monitor the release of pyrophosphate and nucleotide incorporation in real time [199]. A large number of parallel sequencing reactions can be carried out e.g. the GX FLX+ produces a million reads within 23 h [200]. Pyrosequencing has been applied to detect Clostridium, Mycobacterium, parechoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, aichi viruses and herpes viruses in wastewater biosolids [201, 202], Aeromonas and Clostridium in wastewaters [203] and bacteriophages in potable waters [204].",

            "text": "Quantitative PCR assays are applied to determine the quality of drinking water straight from resources [24] and after treatment [22], the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants [23] and the safety of water from recreational beaches [25]. Research showed that qPCR is a specific, sensitive and rapid tool to determine the presence and numbers of microorganisms in water. It has also proven to be useful for reducing the health risks associated with microorganisms in water and to assist in ensuring a safe supply of water [6, 22, 142]. The US EPA is currently considering qPCR as a rapid analytical tool to detect and quantify faecal indicators in recreational waters [118]. Limitations of using qPCR as an analytical tool in routine monitoring include the inability of qPCR to differentiate between live and dead microbial cells. The presence of PCR inhibitors in environmental water samples and the need for standardized qPCR protocols remain a challenge. There is potential for the application of high-throughput analytical systems in detection of waterborne pathogens; however, the technology is still in its infancy. Many challenges still remain to validate the methods in order to use one common protocol. Other challenges in the application of these technologies are the complexity of the assays and the time spent to train laboratory personnel. The high cost involved to do water analysis on a routine basis versus the high sensitivity and reduced time of the assays should also be considered. It is clear from the limitations described that the qPCR method still needs improvement before it can be applied for routine analysis of water.",
