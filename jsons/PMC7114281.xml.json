For example, the HIV pandemic continues to claim two million lives per year, with an estimated 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide [2] and novel human pathogens, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus and H5N1 avian influenza, have recently emerged [3]. Other infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and diarrhoreal disease, remain among the leading causes of death [2]. Dangers are also posed by the spread of infectious agents to new geographic locations, as exemplified by the recent cases of West Nile virus infection in North America [3]. In addition, the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in many bacterial pathogens creates an urgent need for new antimicrobial drugs and strategies for the treatment of infectious diseases [4].",

These include immunosuppressive therapeutics for use in tissue transplantation, autoimmune and inflammatory conditions and compounds designed to stimulate immune responses, for example vaccine adjuvants.

A common application of small molecules is to target intracellular signal transduction pathways [12]. For example, organ transplant rejection can be limited by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin or by inhibiting calcineurin with cyclosporine and FK506, thus reducing T-cell signal transduction. Many other small molecules that target components of pathways, such as those involving nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), are also undergoing clinical trials [12]. Adoptive transfers of dendritic cells [13] and autologous cytotoxic T-cells [14], which are effective therapies for some forms of cancer, can also be considered immunotherapies.",

            "text": "Although many immunotherapies have been approved for use in the clinic and many others have shown efficacy in clinical trials, there are a number of obstacles that prevent their widespread use. The use of immunosuppressive therapies is often associated with increased risk of infections and might also predispose individuals to cancer 15, 16. Immunostimulatory treatments can result in inflammatory tissue damage, autoimmunity or potentially fatal cytokine storms 17, 18. These risks limit the application of most immunotherapies to life-threatening conditions for which better-tolerated treatments are not available. It is increasingly recognized that most conditions will not be treatable through generic stimulation or suppression of the immune system, as demonstrated by the failures of immunosuppressive therapies for sepsis [19]. Hence, we need to develop tools that precisely control, modulate and/or polarize the immune response. To be commercially viable, ideal therapies also need to be broad-spectrum and target a class of related conditions or pathogens. These challenges highlight the importance of studying the immune system from a systems biology perspective to predict the outcome and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies 20, 21. This is discussed further in Box 1\n.Box 1Systems biology approaches to studying immunomodulatory activityDrug development and complex systemsThe innate immune system is a very complex, non-linear network for which there is great potential for subtle manipulations of signaling pathways and subsequent changes in cytokine production with far-reaching downstream effects that might be beneficial but are not completely predictable, desirable or controllable [21]. As recently discussed by Schadt et al.\n[20], progress in drug discovery and development requires an integrated approach that takes into account the non-linear causal relationships inherent in complex systems. This concept applies particularly to immunomodulation because of the significant cross-talk between pathways in the immune system. It is not possible to model the entire innate immune system either in vitro or computationally; however, systems biology approaches can aid in the understanding of complex interactions and signaling pathways. Attempts to understand the likely effects of immunmodulatory drugs require an appreciation of associated interactions within the immune system as a whole and their effects on other major systems, such as metabolism and hormonal and neuronal pathways.Computational aids to systems biology approachesThere are many freely available and commercial bioinformatics tools and databases for data-mining and analysis of many aspects of biological systems. Of particular interest to the development of immunomodulatory drugs are those that include the following:\u2022Interactome data specific to innate immunity, such as InnateDB (www.innatedb.com), a manually curated database and analysis platform for the genes, proteins, interactions, pathways and signaling responses in human and mouse innate immune responses;\u2022Immunology-specific information, especially for immune-relevant transcriptome analysis, such as the Innate Immunity Database (http://db.systemsbiology.net/IIDB);\u2022Pathway interaction data, such as the NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction Database (http://pid.nci.nih.gov); and\u2022Tools for specific protein interaction analysis, such as IntAct (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/).The development and use of InnateDB [51], which integrates data from many other freely available databases and has manually curated interaction information, analysis tools and visualization capability, has provided an insight into the signaling pathways and potential downstream effects of peptide treatments. For example, we recently reported the application of such an approach to study LL-37, with experimental verification of bioinformatics predictions [52]. Conceivably, such a system could be used in conjunction with gene array or proteomics data to aid in the iterative rational design and testing of immunomodulatory peptides by analyzing how individual peptides influence different pathways. Pathway and ontology analyses can also implicate specific biological processes in the activity of these peptides.",

HDPs are produced by the immune systems of all multicellular organisms and are extremely diverse from the perspectives of both sequence and structure. Despite this diversity, most peptides are amphipathic molecules, with an overall net positive charge, and a high content of cationic and hydrophobic amino acids. Classes of peptides such as cathelicidins [23], defensins [24] and histatins [25] are distinguished by their sequence, structure or mechanism of production. The general characteristics of cathelicidins and defensins are described in Box 2\n. In mammals these peptides are primarily produced by leukocytes, mucosal epithelial cells and keratinocytes.Box 2Mammalian host defense peptides\nCathelicidins are cationic amphipathic peptides of diverse linear, \u03b1-helical or \u03b2-hairpin structure and are produced by proteolysis of the C-terminus of cathelin-domain-containing protein precursors [23]. In humans only one cathelicidin precursor, hCAP18, is produced, primarily in leukocytes and epithelial cells. It is cleaved to form peptide LL-37 and in some tissues a range of shorter peptides with altered properties [35]. Mice also produce one cathelicidin, CRAMP, whereas in cattle and pigs the cathelicidin peptide family is highly diverse.Defensins are cationic amphipathic peptides with an approximate length of 30 amino acids and a triple-stranded \u03b2-sheet structure containing three disulfide bonds [24]. Based on their pattern of disulfide bonding, defensins are classified into the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and the less common \u03b8-defensin families. In humans, \u03b1-defensins are produced in neutrophil azurophilic granules as part of their antimicrobial arsenal and by Paneth cells of the intestinal crypts, as well as by other leukocytes and epithelial cells, whereas \u03b2-defensins are produced by mucosal epithelia, skin and some leukocytes. \u03b8-Defensins are circular peptides with anti-HIV activity that are not produced in humans and so far only found in old world monkeys [53].",

However, the microbicidal activity of the peptides is highly sensitive to antagonism by divalent cations, serum and anionic macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans [27], and thus their immunomodulatory activity is probably more significant in many physiological environments. The immunomodulatory activities of HDPs include diverse effects on cell migration, survival and proliferation and the induction of many antimicrobial and immune mediators.

High-throughput in vitro screening of antibacterial activity has been used for validation and iterative optimization of rationally designed antimicrobial peptides 30, 31. Through the use of large data sets, made possible by high-throughput screening of peptide libraries, it has been possible to identify particular physical characteristics that correlate well with direct antimicrobial activity. By contrast, owing to the complexity of the interactions between multiple cell types and effector molecules, it is not possible to screen for subtle immunomodulatory activities in vitro and surrogate markers of this activity must be used. Instead, it is necessary to use screens that correlate with enhanced protection. For example, IDR-1 was selected based on its in vitro immunomodulatory activities, namely enhanced release of chemokines from peptide-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [29] and its ability to protect mice against bacterial infections. Another possible screen would be ability to suppress TNF-\u03b1 induction in response to treatment with TLR agonists [32]. Even with the use of such markers, candidate peptides must ultimately be tested in vivo because isolated cell systems cannot capture the complexity of the innate immune response. Thus, compared to testing of antimicrobial activity, for which there is often a strong correlation between in vitro and in vivo activity, it is much more labor-intensive and costly to generate the large data sets necessary for the application of computational methods to immunomodulatory peptide design. Despite this problem, we now have a few precedents. For example, synthetic endotoxin-binding peptides were optimized for protection in vivo\n[33] and a fragment of the human HDP LL-37 was optimized for anti-endotoxin activity through appropriate amino acid substitutions [34]. Gallo and colleagues [35] subsequently separated the weak antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of LL-37 in individual truncated peptides derived from LL-37. In certain studies the activities of smaller bactenecin- and indolicidin-like synthetic peptides were optimized as components of adjuvant formulations (because innate immunity instructs adaptive immunity) by screening for chemokine-inducing activity and then subjected to in vivo analysis 36, 37, 38.",

We propose that all IDR-like peptides enter cells and interact with particular cellular components to modulate the intracellular signaling pathways of immune cells and have recently identified two such intracellular receptors (unpublished data and Ref. [41]) and we suspect that there are multiple receptors for each HDP and IDR. As these interactors are identified, peptides with the optimal shape, hydrophobicity and/or charge characteristics might be designed in docking studies, although the requirement for uptake might place certain restraints on peptide design.

Systemic safety was demonstrated for hLF1-11 in immunocompromised hematopoetic stem cell transplant recipients. Another interesting peptide, RDP58, which was derived from the heavy chain of HLA class I molecules, was also safe in clinical trials (although much of the information regarding this peptide is not publicly available) [42].

RDP58 reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and IL-12, but did not affect the production of several other cytokines, including IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10.

However, immunomodulatory peptides have finally come of age as clinical candidates. Both approaches have potential applications in targeting other infectious agents, such as viruses, fungi and parasites, through direct action or, more likely, the modulation of appropriate signaling pathways.Anti-inflammatory agentsRegardless of their anti-infective activities, immunomodulatory peptides could also act as anti-inflammatory drugs because many seem to moderate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1.

In addition, HDPs such as LL-37 and IDRs have a strong ability to reverse the pro-inflammatory activities of LPS, suggesting potential as anti-endotoxic agents [50].Wound healing and anti-tumor activityLL-37 promotes wound healing, independent of its direct antimicrobial properties, which could potentially be exploited for peptides that mimic this activity 54, 55. Another important activity in this context is the ability to stimulate angiogenesis. Although LL-37 can enhance the potential for tumor metastasis 56, 57, there is potential for peptide-based drugs as anti-tumor agents, as demonstrated by current trials of glutoxim/NOV-002 (Table 2).Novel vaccine adjuvantsStrong data support the use of synthetic IDRs as components of vaccine formulations. The inclusion of poly-L-lysine in a vaccine formulation with CpG-oligodinucleotide (ODN) moderated induction of the potentially dangerous pro-inflammatory cytokine response [58]. In addition, both IC31 [comprising a synthetic peptide (KLKL(5)KLK) attached to a synthetic ODN] and a formulation of indolicidin, CpG ODN and polyphosphazene induced antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses 37, 38, 59. Garlapati et al.\n[36] recently demonstrated adjuvant activity for IDRs in neonatal pigs in combination with other molecules such as CpG ODNs and polyphosphazenes. The authors proposed that such formulations could be used as adjuvants that are effective in neonates, a population that is notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate and that is highly susceptible to many potentially fatal infectious diseases. It is also conceivable that peptides can be developed as adjuvants for mucosal vaccines because they could be optimized for enhanced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18) and chemokines, such as MCP-1, which show adjuvant activity when administered with mucosal vaccinations [60].",

Clinical evaluation of immunotherapeutics must be approached in a manner that differs from traditional pharmacology, because the immune system self-amplifies its responses to rapidly overcome potential infectious agents that multiply exponentially. It is perhaps na\u00efve to assume that immunomodulatory drugs will demonstrate typical dose\u2013response pharmacodynamics. In addition, the potential for harm that can accompany inappropriate stimulation of immunity dictates a cautious approach. Immune responses are often delicately balanced and upsetting this balance too greatly can render the system unable to return to homeostasis. Minor perturbations of immune homeostasis observed in pre-clinical testing can translate into catastrophic effects in humans, as was the case for the near-lethal cytokine storm induced by the CD28 antagonist TGN1412 in phase I trials [18].",

Two phase II trials of RDP58 in a combined cohort of 127 patients revealed that the drug was well tolerated (adverse effects equivalent to placebo) and efficacious in improving sigmoidoscopy scores in colitis patients receiving medium or high doses of the drug [42]. The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis is thought to be at least partially due to dysregulated host responses to intestinal microbiota [44] and although RDP58 is being investigated for its anti-inflammatory properties it might also alter host responses to microbiota in a manner similar to that of anti-infective peptides.",

Thus, a series of peptides have been used as topical antimicrobials, including pexiganan (MSI-78), omiganan (MX-226), iseganan (IB-367), hLF1-11, XOMA-629, and HB-1345 (Table 2).

The addition of glutoxim to standard tuberculosis therapy regimes reduced the time needed to clear the bacterium, increased the time to resolution of pulmonary infiltrate and increased the rate of post infection weight gain [46]. Adverse effects were limited to transient febrile events that resolved on discontinuation of the drug. Pre-clinical studies in human neutrophils and whole blood demonstrated an immunomodulatory mode of action [47], suggesting that immunomodulatory peptide-based drugs can be safe and effective. Glutoxim is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in the USA as a chemotherapy adjuvant (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00347412) in non-small-cell lung cancer rather than as an anti-infective, possibly because of the relatively low incidence of tuberculosis in the USA and lesser potential for return on investment. Early results are promising and include reductions in chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and modulation of lymphocyte subsets (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00347412), suggesting that glutoxim might also have an immunomodulatory role in the treatment of neoplastic disease.",

One possibility is that the peptides prime immune cells; indeed, their ability to translocate into immune cells [40] might protect them from proteolytic degradation.

            "text": "Synthetic immunomodulatory IDR peptides have significant potential as anti-infective therapeutics and current research promises to reveal crucial mechanistic information that should greatly enhance the development of optimized IDRs. There is the potential to tailor the design of IDRs for different purposes, not all of which will necessarily be anti-infective. The ability to subtly alter the normal balance between protective innate immune responses, such as chemokine production and concomitant leukocyte recruitment (which they enhance), and the potentially harmful effects of excessive inflammation (which they can suppress) provides a unique opportunity to assist in innate immune protection against pathogens. This approach is unlikely to result in the development of microbial resistance to the IDRs and also avoids or suppresses the inflammation associated with bacterial debris that often accompanies conventional antibiotic therapy. Although much research is still required in this area, the potential of this novel approach to anti-infective therapy is vast.",

These candidate peptides are tested in vitro and in vivo and computational analysis is used to select characteristics associated with function. New candidate peptides can then be designed using this structure\u2013function relationship information and further testing reveals further information. Data from in vitro and in vivo testing also inform studies of the mechanism of action of IDRs and this information can feed back in to the bioinformatic and computational design approach.
