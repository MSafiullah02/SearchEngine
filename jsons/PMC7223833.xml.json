            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a leading cause of bacteremia and the most common cause of infective endocarditis in industrialized countries [1, 2]. S. aureus bacteremia is associated with severe complications including infective endocarditis, osteoarticular infections, and septic shock that ultimately result in increased patient mortality [3\u20135]. Additionally, involvement of resistant bacterial strains, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), make S. aureus bacteremia challenging to treat [6]. Vancomycin and daptomycin are the recommended first-line therapies for MRSA bacteremia and infective endocarditis [7]; however, alternative therapies may be needed for strains with reduced susceptibility or resistance to antibacterial agents, potential toxicities, and even general lack of efficacy in certain patient populations. Different therapies are also necessary for treatment of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia especially regarding patients with beta-lactam allergies [8\u201310]. Moreover, daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants and is unsuitable for bacteremic patients with a respiratory focus of infection [11]. Current clinical and microbiologic treatments for bacteremia are far from ideal in terms of the time to effective therapy, pathogen-susceptibility, and specificity [4, 12]. Owing to the considerable mortality associated with S. aureus bacteremia [4, 6], there is a need to identify more efficacious alternative agents.",

Clinical response at EOTT was available for 132/151 (87.4%) patients; 21/151 (13.9%) patients died \u2264 28 days after starting telavancin treatment. Only two of the deaths were considered possibly related to telavancin by investigators. Of these 151 patients, 54.3% were male, 64.2% were < 65 years of age, and 77.5% were White. Median body mass index was 27.3 kg/m2 (mean 28.70 \u00b1 8 0.47) and most had at least one co-morbidity (n = 146; 96.7%), primarily hypertension (46.4%) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (30.5%) (Table 2). At baseline, 13 (8.6%) patients were on dialysis, including intermittent hemodialysis (n = 8; 5.3%) and continuous renal replacement therapy (n = 4; 2.6%). Baseline serum creatinine concentration was within the normal range (0.55\u20131.18 mg/dL) [21] for 50% of patients with a serum creatinine concentration measurement [n = 111; median 0.8 mg/dL, interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 mg/dL], and the baseline median estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 108.5 mL/min (n = 110) (Table 2).",

Cases of endocarditis treated with telavancin found in the literature were all MRSA cases, and most were initially treated with vancomycin. In one publication that reviewed most of the published cases identified, it was noted that bacteremia cleared after initiation of telavancin (median of 1 day later, range 1\u20133) in 9/15 cases with bacteremia already cleared before telavancin initiation in the remaining six cases [22]. Notably, side effects were not reported during telavancin therapy in these reviewed cases [22\u201326]. TOUR investigators often dosed patients with bacteremia and/or endocarditis with an average daily dose of telavancin different from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosages; this was also true for the overall TOUR population [19]. A positive clinical response, cured or improved to step-down oral therapy, was reported for the majority of patients with an available assessment at EOTT (74.2%; Fig. 2), with most patients cured at the post-treatment assessment (67.0% of those with an available assessment).

Though the best duration of therapy for uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia is still debated, patients may receive treatment for 7\u201314 days for these infections [3, 28]. For complicated bacteremia (including endocarditis), 4\u20136 weeks of antibacterial therapy is recommended [3, 7, 28]. The designation of complicated or uncomplicated bacteremia was not recorded in TOUR. Furthermore, duration of therapy for patients with bacteremia or endocarditis was varied, with patients split nearly equally between < 7, 7\u201320, and \u2265 21 days of therapy. Interestingly, the positive clinical response rate at EOTT for patients who received \u2265 21 days of telavancin therapy was about 91%, as compared to about 66% of patients with shorter courses of therapy. This may suggest that longer courses of therapy could be beneficial for Gram-positive bacteremia or endocarditis; however, many other factors could have contributed to the differences in response rates.",

Based on the real-world data from TOUR, more than three-quarters of patients on telavancin with available CrCl measurements did not experience a decline in renal function. In TOUR, telavancin was often the second-line or greater therapy for bacteremia or endocarditis. This is not surprising as MRSA was the most frequent infecting pathogen and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend vancomycin or daptomycin as first-line antibacterial agents for these infections [7]. Consequently, this practice may have selected patients with worse prognosis for enrollment in TOUR, affecting outcomes and safety analyses.",

The decision to enroll a patient was made by the individual study clinicians, potentially introducing bias into patient selection at the start. Data collection by retrospective medical chart review restricted the available information for each patient. In addition, safety data collection in TOUR was not comprehensive, but instead focused on adverse events of interest including renal TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation or fatal outcome, which were reported at the discretion of the investigator. Renal function indicators were also not consistently collected. Additionally, the efficacy outcomes of this registry study were subjective, microbiology data were not collected systemically, and there was no differentiation between complicated and uncomplicated bacteremia. Finally, loss of patients to follow-up likely impacts the interpretation of the results. Despite these limitations, TOUR provides insight into telavancin use in US clinical practice to treat patients with bacteremia and endocarditis caused by challenging Gram-positive pathogens.",

S. aureus species were the most common pathogens identified, with more than half of patients infected with MRSA. With the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis, it is important to provide more treatment options. These real-world data from TOUR suggest that telavancin may represent an alternative treatment option for patients with endocarditis, bacteremia of an unknown primary source, or bacteremia with a known source due to S. aureus or other Gram-positive bacteria.",
