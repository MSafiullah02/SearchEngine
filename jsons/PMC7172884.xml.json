Upon entry into the cytoplasm of susceptible cells, the viral RNA genome is translated by host ribosomes to produce a large polyprotein. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage of this polyprotein by virally encoded peptidase(s) (and in some cases by an unknown host peptidases) leads to mature viral proteins that perform key functions such as replication of the viral RNA genome, assembly of progeny virions and virus\u2013host antagonism. The latter include inhibition of cellular mRNA translation and transcription, inhibition/induction of apoptosis, and membrane vesicularization.",

These enzymes are cysteine peptidases with folds also similar to that of chymotrypsin rather than that of papain. 3CL peptidase has an additional domain that mediates homodimerization, which is thought to be critical for the enzymatic activity of 3CL.3 The catalytic mechanisms of 3C and 3CL are thought to proceed via a tetrahedral intermediate resulting from the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond by the S\u03b3 of the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys172 in HAV 3C). However, many mechanistic details remain unknown. Detailed understanding at atomic resolution of how 3C enzymes cleave their cognate substrates would greatly facilitate the rational design of anti-viral drugs. Such knowledge will help to control these dangerous pathogens in the event of a pandemic outbreak, such as the recent FMDV epidemic in England that caused significant loss of animals and the accompanying financial woes.4\n",

            "text": "The use of substrate analogue inhibitors to probe enzymatic mechanisms has a long tradition in research on proteinases. Peptidyl chloromethyl ketones react with papain and serine proteinases in dissimilar ways to yield different types of covalent adducts with the catalytic residues. In chymotrypsin, Ser195 forms a covalent linkage to the carbonyl carbon of chloromethyl ketone inhibitors, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry thought to mimic the transition state that occurs during the hydrolysis of natural substrates.5., 6., 7. In addition, the N\u03b52 atom of His57 attacks the halogenated \u03b1-carbon yielding a second covalent attachment between the inhibitor and the now alkylated enzyme. When the chloromethyl function is replaced with a chloroethyl group in the inhibitor, His57 is alkylated with retention of configuration at the chiral center.8 Together with kinetic studies, this indicates an internal nucleophilic displacement of chloride by the newly formed oxyanion in the tetrahedral intermediate leading to a Ser195-epoxy ether adduct that is opened by the histidine.9\n,\n10 In contrast, papain is inactivated by direct covalent linkage between the S\u03b3 atom of Cys25 and the halogenated \u03b1-carbon of the same class of inhibitors.11 The imidazole ring of His159 in papain is implicated in protonating the leaving group due to its shift in orientation from a position in-plane with the S\u03b3 atom of Cys25 to a position in-plane with the the \u03b1-carbon of the inhibitor, an atom equivalent to the N of a scissile bond.12 However, it is unclear whether reversible formation of a tetrahedral intermediate occurs prior to alkylation of Cys25.",

            "text": "The peptidyl portion of inhibitors Ia and Ib offers a fairly good resemblance to the most favored sequence (P4 to P1 positions) of the cleavage sites by HAV 3C in the viral polyprotein. Inhibitor II was included in this study as a mimetic of a less optimal substrate than the LAAQ sequence in inhibitors Ia and Ib, mainly due to the substitutions at the P1 (Gln->Glu) and P2 (Ala->Phe) positions of its peptidyl portion. Sequence alignment analysis of the naturally occurring cleavage sites for HAV 3C proteinase in the hepatitis A viral polyprotein indicates a clear preference for small residues such as serine and threonine at the P2 position. Available structural information strongly supports this conclusion.15\n,\n17\n,\n18 Furthermore, glutamate does occasionally occur as the P1 residue at the natural cleavage sites within picornaviral polyproteins, although at a much lower frequency than glutamine. Here, we are interested in understanding how the interactions between the HAV 3C enzyme and peptidyl inhibitors are influenced by the amino acid make-up of the inhibitors. The substrate recognition sites (S1 to S4) of HAV 3C are identified crystallographically. No covalent linkage occurred between His44 and any of the inhibitors.

Until the recently reported crystallization of a Cys24Ser variant of HAV 3C in space group P212121, there was no structural evidence that the three catalytic residues in the proteolytic active site, His44, Asp84 and Cys172, form the canonical triad assembly as observed in chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases and other picornaviral 3C enzymes.15 Furthermore, the earlier crystal structures16., 17., 18. were of inactivated forms of HAV 3C containing either a substituted catalytic cysteine residue (Cys172Ala) or an oxidized form of Cys172, thereby complicating the study of enzyme-substrate/inhibitor interactions. Indeed, soaking of substrate-like inhibitors into pre-grown crystals of these active site variants of HAV 3C has met with little success. Here, HAV 3C crystals formed after incubating the Cys24Ser variant with BBL were used for the subsequent binding of three tetrapeptidyl-based inhibitors (Figure 1). Analysis of the soaked crystals by mass spectrometry revealed a difference in mass between 3C-BBL and 3C-BBL-inhibitor Ib, that is within experimental error of the calculated molecular mass of acetyl-LAA(N,N-dimethyl)Q-methylene (data not shown). This suggests that the phthalhydrazide group is lost during the covalent attachment of inhibitor Ib to the HAV 3C enzyme in a fashion similar to the loss of fluoride from the other two inhibitors.19\n",

The efficacy of the inhibitor in cells is probably due to a combination of effects, including the irreversibility of inhibition and the fact that polyprotein processing is upstream of many key replicative events during HAV infection. Therefore, even partially blocking the 3C proteinase function with inhibitor Ia would have a profound impact on progeny virion production.",

In the three new structures, BBL was bound to the N\u03b52 atom of His102 in the same manner as in the 3C\u2013BBL structure.15 The average r.m.s.d. values between the three new structures reported here and 3C-BBL are in the range of 0.23 \u00c5 to 0.30 \u00c5 over the C\u03b1 positions of all residues (Table 1\n), suggesting that little structural rearrangement is required for the binding of substrate-analogue inhibitors. This confirms our previous claim that the crystallized enzyme is in its catalytically competent conformation.15 Comparison of the r.m.s.d. values at each of the C\u03b1 positions reveals that the three new complexes differ significantly from 3C-BBL in only three regions (Figure 4\n): those comprising residues 49\u201351, 142\u2013154 and 194\u2013196. These differences suggest that enzyme\u2013substrate complex formation involves an induced-fit mechanism, whereby subtle structural adjustments optimize enzyme\u2013substrate interactions. Residues 142\u2013154 form a major part of the \u03b2-hairpin motif that sits atop the catalytic residues in HAV 3C. Some of the residues in this \u03b2-hairpin help form the S sub-sites for substrate binding (vide infra). The complexes with inhibitors Ia and Ib share greater structural similarity with each other than with the inhibitor II complex (Table 1). This supports our hypothesis that inhibitors Ia and Ib react similarly in the active site of 3C despite the different substituents on the terminal \u03b1-carbon of these two inhibitors. Additionally, since both inhibitors Ia and II are fluoromethyl ketones, the differences in their tetrapeptidyl sequence must be the key cause for their structural divergences. This suggests that HAV 3C uses subtle structural adjustments to \u201cmeasure up\u201d the binding fitness of each inhibitor/substrate. The structural differences between the inhibitor Ia and II complexes are consistent with HAV 3C's preferences for (1) small residues at the P2 position of the cleavage site and (2) glutamine at the P1 position.",

His191 sits at the bottom of the S1 pocket and Leu199 at the back end opposite to Cys172. The imidazole side-chain of His191 is locked in a particular tautomeric conformation by the hydrogen bond between its N\u03b41 atom and one of the two buried water molecules that are also hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate of Glu132. His191 is poised to interact with the P1 residue of the incoming peptidyl substrate: the O\u03b51 atom of a P1 glutamine residue would form an optimal hydrogen bond to the N\u03b52 atom of His191. Indeed, the O\u03b51 atoms of P1-Glnmm in either inhibitor Ia and Ib are at a distance of 3.0 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5 to the N\u03b52 atom of His191. It is interesting to note that neither carboxyl oxygen atoms of P1-Glu in inhibitor II forms a direct hydrogen bond to His191. Instead, the O\u03b51 atom of P1-Glu is hydrogen bonded to the N\u03b52 atom of His191 via a bridging water molecule, which is at distances of 2.7 \u00c5 and 2.6 \u00c5 to the former and latter atoms, respectively. In the crystal structure of 3C\u2013BBL complex, a similar water molecule forms a hydrogen bond to the N\u03b52 atom of His191 with a comparable distance of 2.8 \u00c5.

This provides strong evidence that the imidazole ring of His191 is neutral in these complexes, as otherwise a direct hydrogen bonded ion-pair interaction between P1-Glu and His191 would favor the opposite scenario. With the side-chain of His191 uncharged, the negatively charged carboxylate side-chain of P1-Glu naturally favors a more solvent-exposed location. Additionally, the non-optimal binding of P2-Phe residue of inhibitor II to the S2 site also contributes to the shallow penetration of P1-Glu in the S1 pocket.

Thus, an episulfide cation fits the electron density far better than a single S\u03b3\u2013C bond to either the CC or the C' atom. Although related thiiranium cations bearing only carbon substituents are well-recognized intermediates in chemical syntheses,25\n,\n26 including a few especially stable, structurally characterized examples,27 to the best of our knowledge there is only one report of a thiiranium (episulfide) cation having an oxyanion substituent detected as an intermediate in gas phase studies.28 In the final model of HAV 3C with inhibitor Ia, the distances between the S\u03b3 atom of Cys172 and C' or CC (P1-Gln) are 1.83 \u00c5 and 1.82 \u00c5, respectively (Figure 6(a)). The imidazole ring of His44 is coplanar with S\u03b3 and C' and its N\u03b52 atom is at distances of 4.1 \u00c5 and 3.3 \u00c5 from S\u03b3 and C', respectively.

The C'-S\u03b3-CC angle is \u223c 51\u00b0, which is feasible due to the fact that sulfur has a larger atomic radius than either oxygen or carbon. The latter elements would not be able to form a three-membered ring structure with similar stability, which is perhaps why the epoxy ether intermediate proposed to develop during the inactivation of the serine proteinases by chloromethyl ketone inhibitors has not been observed in previous crystal structures.5\n,\n29 The episulfide ring structures in the inhibitor Ia and inhibitor Ib complexes are essentially identical (Table 1 and Figure 5, Figure 6).",

Further fitting indicated that this represents an alternative mode of bonding of the inhibitor characterized by a single covalent linkage between Cys172 S\u03b3 and the C' of inhibitor II. Interestingly, this mode of bonding corresponds to that observed in the crystal structure of an inactivated papain in which Cys25 is covalently attached to a chloromethyl ketone compound.12 Furthermore, the relative orientations of the methylketone moiety of the inhibitor, the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues are also shared between these two cysteine proteinases of different folds. Nevertheless, the two enzymes made different structural adjustments in arriving at these conformations. In the case of papain, the imidazole ring of His159, in-plane with the S\u03b3 atom of Cys25 in the apoenzyme, rotated about the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 bond to become coplanar with the atom equivalent to the N atom of the scissile peptide bond. In the 3C\u2013BBL\u2013inhibitor II complex structure containing an episulfide ring, the S\u03b3 atom of Cys172 is coplanar with the C' atom of the inhibitor and the imidazole ring of His44. In the alternative conformation lacking this ring, the atomic positions of His44 are unchanged, whereas the S\u03b3\u2013C\u03b2 bond of Cys172 is rotated \u223c 91\u00b0 out toward the solvent, causing the S\u03b3 atom to roll out of the common plane containing His44 imidazole ring and C'. The new position of the S\u03b3 atom is 2.8 \u00c5 from CC atom of P1-Glu of inhibitor II, which is comparable to the average distance (2.8 \u00c5) between S\u03b4 and C\u03b2 in the eight methionine residues in the HAV 3C molecules.",

In the latter structure, the imidazole ring of His44 is rotated about its C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 bond by roughly 10\u00b0 and becomes more in-plane with the carbon at the \u03b1 position of the ketomethylene function of the iVF inhibitor than with the S\u03b3 atom of Cys172. Judging from the two alternate conformations of the 3C\u2013inhibitor II complex, it seems possible that an internal displacement reaction would resolve the episulfide ring and eventually form an alkylated Cys172 in the active site. However, it is unclear how an episulfide cation is produced in the first place. There are at least three potential routes leading to the formation of an episulfide ring (Figure 7\n). In scheme I, the S\u03b3 atom of Cys172 attacks C' directly in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to replace the fluoride. This would then be followed by the attack of a lone electron pair of the S\u03b3 atom on the carbonyl carbon to form the oxyanion and the episulfide cation. In schemes II and III, the S\u03b3 atom of Cys172 first attacks the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral intermediate and the oxyanion. In scheme II, a lone electron pair of S\u03b3 then displaces the fluoride. In scheme III, the oxyanion displaces the fluoride to form a transient epoxy ether, which then rearranges to the more stable episulfide ring. As X-ray crystallography shows only snapshots of structures of interest, unless one of these proposed intermediate species can be uniformly formed and stably preserved in crystals, other experimental tools will be needed to differentiate among these mechanistic pathways.",

His44, with the assistance of Asp84, acts as a general base catalyst to receive a proton from Cys172, thereby producing a relatively strong nucleophilic thiolate ion. This thiolate subsequently attacks the carbonyl-carbon atom of the scissile bond, forming the tetrahedral intermediate. In the next step, His44 donates a proton to the nitrogen atom of the P1' residue making it a better leaving group. This is followed by the cleavage of the peptide bond and the formation of a thiolacyl enzyme. To fulfill its various roles in this mechanism, His44 must adjust its orientation toward Cys172 accordingly. Interestingly, the two predicted conformations of the His44-Cys172 pair correspond well to those observed in the two 3C-BBL\u2013inhibitor II complex structures.",
