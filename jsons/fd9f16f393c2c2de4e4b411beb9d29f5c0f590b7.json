The disease has been named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and it has remained on the radar of global public health authorities because of recurrent nosocomial and community outbreaks, and its association with severe disease and high mortality rates ; There is wishful anticipation in the political and scientific communities that MERS-CoV like SARS-CoV will disappear with time. However it's been nearly 4 years since the first discovery of MERS-CoV, and MERS cases continue to be reported throughout the year from the Middle East (WHO 2015c). There is a large MERS-CoV camel reservoir, and there is no specific treatment or vaccine ). With 10 million people visiting Saudi Arabia every year for Umrah and/or Hajj, the potential risk of global spread is ever present McCloskey et al. 2014; Al-Tawfiq et al. 2014a ).

Studies on bat feces from Middle East, Africa and several European countries have reported CoV in Nycteris and Pipistrellus bats (Annan et al. 2013; Memish et al. 2013c) . From Saudi Arabia, over a thousand bat samples were tested and only one fragment of MERS-CoV was found in one Taphozous bat which was related to MERS-CoV isolated from humans (Memish et al. 2013c) . Several studies have subsequently indicated that MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus and human infections have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels (Reusken et al. 2013 Haagmans et al. 2014; Hemida et al. 2014; Meyer et al. 2014; Muller et al. 2014; Gossner et al. 2016 camels. The apparent rarity of MERS-CoV transmission from primary MERS cases apart from hospital settings indicates that the transmission potential and infectivity of such cases is low. The occasional sporadic occurrence of MERS-CoV infection in MERS cases who have any reported animal contact or exposure to MERS cases may be explained by low level infectivity of sub-clinical or asymptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection (Lessler et al. 2016 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 224, "text": "(Annan et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 225, "end": 245, "text": "Memish et al. 2013c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 423, "end": 444, "text": "(Memish et al. 2013c)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 630, "end": 650, "text": "(Reusken et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 651, "end": 672, "text": "Haagmans et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 673, "end": 692, "text": "Hemida et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 693, "end": 711, "text": "Meyer et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 712, "end": 731, "text": "Muller et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 732, "end": 751, "text": "Gossner et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1194, "text": "(Lessler et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Origin and Transmission of MERS-CoV"}, {"text": "The sporadic nature of MERS-CoV infection with new cases or clusters distributed over a wide geographic area and rather heterogeneous social settings, represents a significant issue for designing and for implementing solid prospective studies.

Furthermore, the appearance of MERS-CoV, in human populations soon after the SARS-CoV pandemic emphasizes the importance of a One Health approach (Rabozzi et al. 2012 ) to surveillance of zoonotic infections through integration of human, animal, and environmental health programs.

MERS presents as a clinical spectrum from the asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe fulminant multisystem disease. There is limited data on pathogenesis due to lack of autopsy or histological studies. MERS-CoV is known to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors (Lu et al. 2013 ) that are widespread in the body but are primarily located in the lower respiratory tract and thus a typical case of MERS presents with fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath and pneumonia (detailed in Table 1 ). Severe illness can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised host. In general Laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection can be obtained by: (a) MERS-CoV specific nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) with up to two separate targets and/or sequencing; or (b) virus isolation in tissue culture; or (c) serology on serum tested in a WHO collaborating center with established testing methods. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used ISARIC and Public Health 2014; Corman et al. 2012 Corman et al. , 2014 for specimens collected from the respiratory tract of suspected cases.

Early recognition of MERS cases and rapid implementation of infection control guidance is necessary to prevent nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV. Implementation of effective infection control measures at the first consideration of the diagnosis of MERS-CoV is crucial for prevention of MERS-CoV outbreaks.

However this observation may reflect the lack of clinical awareness of MERS and that diagnosis and treatment of respiratory tract infections largely remains empiric, without laboratory confirmation. An estimated 10 million visitors from over 184 countries travel to Saudi Arabia to participate in Hajj pilgrimage, the mini-pilgrimage Umrah or during the month of Ramadan, the vast majority come from developing countries ). If MERS-CoV was a major public health risk, 4 years after its first discover one would have expected cases of MERS-CoV infection in pilgrims.

It is possible that like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV will die out with time. Conversely it is also possible that MERS-CoV will mutate and increase its transmission potential and the risk of MERS-CoV spreading globally remains. Coker and colleagues (Soliman et al. 2015 ) estimated the potential risk of MERS-CoV infection to pilgrims who visit Saudi Arabia from different regions of the world based on the most likely scenario using recent pilgrim numbers for sub-Saharan Africa. They predict that there will be at most ten returning pilgrims each year with MERS-CoV infections.

Moreover airborne infection control measures are mandatory for healthcare workers dealing with patients who undergo aerosol-generating procedures. Several outbreaks of MERS-CoV in Saudi Hospitals in Jeddah, Al-Hasa, and Riyadh were attributed to overcrowding in the emergency departments, uncontrolled patient movement, and high traffic of visitors, lack of infection control stewardship. Effective triage is required at the first suspicion of MERS-CoV and in ill patients with a history of travel to the Middle East. Tracing, screening for symptoms and MERS-CoV, and follow up of all contacts, (family, workmates, patients and visitors) is important in preventing further spread. The implementation of extensive contact tracing in order to rapidly diagnose suspected MERS cases and isolate infectious individuals to break the chain of infections is important. Middle Eastern countries have put in place surveillance systems for the prompt detection and investigation of new cases and contact tracing. The MERS outbreak in South Korea highlights the potential of MERS-CoV to spread across the globe and cause local outbreaks(Petersen et al. 2015; Hui et al. 2015b). Whilst cases of MERS related to travel to the Middle East have been reported from a wide geographical area, of note is the absence of any significant number of MERS cases (primary or travel related) reported from sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries (WHO 2015c;Zumla et al. 2015c). The reasons why MERS-CoV predominantly affects humans in the Middle East and is not endemic in Africa or Asia where MERS-CoV infected camels and bats are present requires further study", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
