            "text": "Rubella virus (RV) is a small, enveloped virus with a positive single-stranded RNA genome (family Togaviridae, genus Rubivirus). RV is an important human pathogen because of its ability to cause multiple pathologies after establishing persistent infections in immune privileged body sites or in fetuses during the first trimester of pregnancy. Persistent infections in a fetus, which has an immature immune system, can result in multiple birth defects called congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) (Driscoll, 1969, Plotkin et al., 2011, Tondury and Smith, 1966). Post-rubella encephalitis, often fatal, has been documented following persistent infections in the brain with both wild type and vaccine viruses (Chaari et al., 2014, Guler et al., 2009, Wolinsky et al., 1982). Chronic recurrent rubella-associated arthritis can develop after immunization of adults (Fraser et al., 1983, Tingle et al., 1985). Granulomas in persons with primary immune deficiencies (PID) and Fuchs's uveitis are newly suggested diseases associated with decades-long persistent RV infections (Abernathy et al., 2015, Bodemer et al., 2014, Doan et al., 2016, Perelygina et al., 2016). Currently, there are no antiviral drugs to treat rubella infections and identification of treatments for chronic rubella diseases will be beneficial.",

NTZ was also shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities and is currently in Phase II/III clinical trials for hepatitis C, influenza viruses, rotavirus and norovirus (Korba et al., 2008, Rossignol, 2014, Rossignol et al., 2009). No significant drug-related health issues have been reported; the drug is safe and is approved for pediatric use (Cohen, 2005, Fox and Saravolatz, 2005). NTZ targets host functions that are essential for viral replication, but are not pathogen-specific. Several anti-viral mechanisms have been proposed such as induction of innate immunity, downregulation of viral receptors or interference with maturation of viral structural proteins at the post-translational stage, probably due to Ca2+ depletion inducing chronic sub-lethal stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ashiru et al., 2014, Elazar et al., 2009, Gekonge et al., 2015, Korba et al., 2008, La Frazia et al., 2013, Rossignol et al., 2009, Trabattoni et al., 2016).",

An empiric 2-month antiviral treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a was given according to the hepatitis C regimen (Hoofnagle and Seeff, 2006). The patient was tired, dizzy and lost her appetite when high doses of the drug were given. She also developed thrombocytopenia. The treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions of the drug. One month later, the patient was given 500 mg of oral NTZ twice daily for two months, which was well tolerated as no obvious negative side-effects were noted. The effectiveness of the treatments was evaluated by immunostaining skin biopsies taken from the same lesion for RV. While the peginterferon treatment had no effect on the amount and distribution of RV antigen, the NTZ treatment resulted in almost complete elimination of RV antigen from the lesions. No antigen was detected in the epidermis and only sporadic, weakly stained macrophages were observed in the sequential sections of the biopsy (Fig. 1C). The treatment did not provide noticeable clinical improvement in the remaining five months of her life.

Although less effective, treatments initiated at the later stages (14\u201324 hpi) were still able to significantly block virus production.

We confirmed these results using a different reference gene, \u03b2-actin (Fig. 6B). Quantitation of the fluorescence intensities by ImageJ revealed 5\u20136 fold reduction of both GAPDH and \u03b2-actin RNA signals (Fig. 6C). These results suggested either inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis by NTZ or activation of an RNA degradation pathway such as RNAseL. To further test this hypothesis, cell monolayers were treated with either 5 \u03bcg/ml NTZ, 0.1% DMSO or 10 \u03bcg/ml actinomycin D (inhibitor of cellular transcription) and then nascent RNA was fluorescently labeled using RNA-click chemistry. Analysis of microscopic images showed that the size and fluorescence intensity in nucleoli (region of ribosomal RNA synthesis) were decreased after the NTZ treatment (Fig. 7\nA). Total nascent RNA levels per nucleus determined by quantitation of the fluorescence intensity of nuclei (n = 50 for each condition) with ImageJ were found to be reduced by \u223c30% in the NTZ-treated samples compared to the levels in the control samples (Fig. 7B). Thus, NTZ inhibits synthesis of both viral and cellular RNA.",

            "text": "We observed the apparent effectiveness of NTZ and the lack of effectiveness of interferon therapy in a single PID patient with severe skin granulomas positive for RV antigen. Two-month peginterferon treatment, which was given prior to NTZ, did not eliminate or reduce the amount of RV antigen in the lesions of this patient. The inability of interferon-alpha therapies to reduce RV excretion has been also reported in infants with congenital rubella syndrome (Arvin et al., 1982). Following treatment with 500 mg oral NTZ for two months, RV was cleared from the wounds of the patient, but no clinical improvement was observed. There are several possible reasons for that. First of all, although the association between skin granulomas and RV infection has been clearly demonstrated in individuals with some primary immune deficiencies (Bodemer et al., 2014, Perelygina et al., 2016), the causal role of RV infection in the formation of granulomas has not yet been proven. However, the absence of RV RNA in the unaffected skin ((Bodemer et al., 2014); our unpublished observations) and detection of RV in granulomas in the internal organs of some PID patients ((Neven et al., 2017); our unpublished observations) suggest the causality. Of course, with lesions that develop years or even decades after vaccination, causality determinations will likely require prospective studies with long-term follow up. The patient had a very advanced/extensive case. Her lesions had have persisted for more than a decade, and so one would expect it to take a long time to reach complete clinical or histological cure after elimination of the foreign antigen, at best. Furthermore, this chronic infection may have caused long-term or, perhaps, permanent damage to the skin. In addition, secondary bacterial skin infection after the NTZ treatment may also have interfered with the healing process. However, an NTZ treatment may be effective in stopping the development in newly-formed lesions and preventing RV spread and subsequent formation of granulomas in new locations.",

NTZ was shown to deplete Ca2+ in ER, resulting in perturbation of folding and maturation of secreted and transmembrane proteins and their transfer within ER or ER-Golgi export (Ashiru et al., 2014). We demonstrated the lack of a co-localization of the large proportion of E2 with E1 suggesting perturbed E1-E2 complex formation.

For example, immunomodulatory effects of NTZ (Hong et al., 2012, Trabattoni et al., 2016) may have played a role. Following oral administration, NTZ is rapidly adsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and then hydrolyzed to form tizoxanide (desacetyl nitazoxanide), which is further metabolized to form tizoxanide glucuronide (Broekhuysen et al., 2000). Tizoxanide is at least as active in vitro as NTZ against different viruses, while tizoxanide glucuronide exhibits only moderate antiviral activities (Korba et al., 2008, La Frazia et al., 2013, Rossignol, 2009). Second-generation thiazolides with favorable pharmacokinetics and improved antiviral activities are currently under development and evaluation (Keeffe and Rossignol, 2009). Future testing of active NTZ metabolites and new generation thiazolides (e.g., RM-5038 and it active derivative RM-4848) should aid in understanding of anti-RV mechanisms of thiazolides in vivo and in identification of the most effective anti-RV compounds.",

Our data suggest multiple in vitro mechanisms of drug action including inhibition of cellular and viral RNA synthesis and aberrant trafficking of viral structural proteins. NTZ could be the first drug effective for the treatment of persistent rubella infections. The results of this study suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate the ability of NTZ to control chronic rubella infections.",
