[14] [15] [16] Analysis of social media use over a 14 week period during the Ebola outbreak identified it as a potential source of surveillance to enhance detection, preparedness, and, the public health response during a crisis (used in addition to traditional surveillance approach). 17 On 29 March 2020 the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) provided advice to the government that it can use anonymised mobile phone data in the fight against coro- navirus. Similar measures have been taken by other nations to help track the likely spread of the virus. 18 The GMC and the BMA provide guidance on social media use by the medical profession and respect and confidentiality for patients as well as colleagues remains of paramount importance. 19, 20 The authors have recently written an article (in press) on the potential advantages and perils of using social media in medicine. 21 Optimisation and empowering a team can be reinforced at a brief: encouraging situational awareness; asking others to look out for you; taking regular breaks to rest and to eat; staying well hydrated; and, to stop if anything doesn't seem quite right. 22, 23 Assertive followership",

A key element of flight simulators is not just how the crew interacts with the system, but also with each other. The need for subordinate crew members to challenge authority by asking questions, expressing concerns, or airing vulnerabilities without the fear of retribution or humiliation is encouraged and taught to enhance Flight Safety. Consequently, to enable effective systems-based medical training, a challenge culture of assertive followership is a vital element, not only to enhance learning but to reduce medical error. However, for a challenge culture to be effective requires the whole organisation to adopt and encourage this culture, with those in positions of authority actively flattening the hierarchy by championing and adopting such open practices.",

Consequently, both views should be balanced so that decisions are based on reality, and, where there is doubt, an abundance of caution is advisable from a risk reduction perspective, given the poor outcomes for healthcare workers in many countries thus far.",
