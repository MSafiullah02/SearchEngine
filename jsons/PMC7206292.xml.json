Extremely fast decision trees are one of the top performers for high-data-throughput contexts [11]. Random forests and gradient boosted trees have relatively high computational demands in inference, and thus may not be suitable for wearable or embedded IOT (Internet of Things) applications. So, the problem of making a single tree perform well in inference arises, and one can ask does a single decision tree beat a random forest with 10 trees. Moreover, trees also serve as one of the few global models considered to be interpretable, an increasingly important requirement in applications [12]. Thus, quality single decision tree built efficiently have many uses.",

Simple probability smoothing techniques, such as Laplace smoothing and M-estimation, have long been used to improve PETs\u2019 class probability estimates by making the estimates at leaves less extreme.

It assumes that the class probability of the leaf node depends on the probabilities of its parents in some hierarchy. To our knowledge, M-branch smoothing [5] is the first and only one hierarchical method for PETs. It smooths the leaf node to its direct parent using M-estimation, with the parent also been smoothed recursively until the root node reached. The results demonstrate that M-branch performs better than M-estimation. Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) [13] can also be used to smooth the probability at the leaves with its parent, partially mimicking what is done in M-branch, but it uses fully Bayesian inference. A decision tree can be turned into a HDP model tree with each node in the tree associated with a Dirichlet Process (DP). Similar HDP smoothing methods allow Bayesian network classifiers [13] and language models [17] to get state-of-the-art probability estimates but has not been applied to decision trees.",

We first show that HDP can help PETs get better estimates compared with M-estimation. However, HDP is computationally intensive. A novel, more efficient hierarchical smoothing method called Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing (HGS) is proposed. Unlike HDP and M-branch, HGS smooths the leaf node to all the ancestor nodes at once, where each ancestor has a weight parameter to control the smoothness. We propose Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) cost to PETs and conduct a gradient descent algorithm [16] on the cost to automatically obtain the parameters. One time smoothing and gradient descent make HGS more efficient than recursive smoothing and sampling. A single PET With HGS makes more than 90/143 UCI datasets obtain the best probability estimates. Besides, HGS makes single tree superior to Random Forest with 7 trees and almost as good with 10 trees.",

LOOCV is a special case of k fold cross-validation, where k equals to the number of training examples N. In each fold of the cross-validation, an example is treated as a test example while the others are the training examples. LOOCV could be sped up using incremental LOOCV [7, 9]. The idea is instead of training a model during each fold of the cross-validation, first, train a model on the full dataset, then delete the one example that is left out, test on that example, then insert it into the model again. This delete-test-insert phase is repeated for each of the N folds. Incremental LOOCV can be conducted on any algorithm that supports incremental learning, allowing for dynamically adding or removing examples from the model. Decision tree learning is such an algorithm. Note incremental LOOCV means the model structure remains unchanged.",
