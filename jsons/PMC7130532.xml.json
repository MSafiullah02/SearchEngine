            "text": "In the past few decades, the number of patients who are immunosuppressed has increased dramatically. This growth is largely secondary to the global epidemic of HIV, the development of more aggressive and successful chemotherapy regimens, and the progress of solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).10 Despite advances in treating infections and significant progress with new preventative techniques,11 infection continues to be the leading cause of death in these populations. Patients who are immunocompromised have long been recognized as higher risk for viral pneumonia, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus, and measles. Over the past few decades, RSV, influenza, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus, picornavirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have also been recognized as causes of pneumonia in the immunocompromised population. In a study of viral infections in patient who had undergone HSCT, the incidence of influenza ranged from 14% to 52%, RSV from 14% to 48%, adenovirus from 2% to 21%, and PIV from 11% to 49% of all viral isolates.12 The incidence and outcome of these viral pneumonias can vary significantly based on the intensity and duration of T-cell\u2013mediated immune suppression.11, 13 Other factors in the pathogenesis of viral infections include stem cell product, donor\u2013recipient matching and appropriate screening in both, composition of the conditioning regimen, and graft-versus-host disease.",

Influenza A infection, the most commonly studied virus in this area of research, can also alter the inflammatory and immune response. Both influenza and bacterial infections use similar pathways, cofactors, and intermediates, and the overlap in the inflammatory mediators produced may create an interference with or augmentation of the host immune response.16 This alteration of the immune response contributes to the severity of the resulting infection either through diminishing the ability of the host to clear the bacteria or through amplification of the inflammatory cascade. The overwhelming inflammatory cascade is usually the culprit in rapidly progressive lower respiratory tract disease resulting in ARDS.17, 18\n",

Despite this, two different pathologic processes are reflected in two common radiographic patterns: a slowly progressive, insidious course of pneumonia and a rapidly progressive or virulent pneumonia.20 The insidious form is characterized by lymphatic infiltrates in the alveolar septa, which may extend to the areas adjacent to the terminal and respiratory bronchioles. On CT scan, well-defined nodules and patchy areas of peribronchial ground-glass opacity and air-space consolidation are seen. Because the viruses are intracellular, most of the pathologic changes tend to occur in the epithelium and adjacent interstitial tissue. In the rapidly progressive form, the underlying disease process is often diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and the infiltrate often extends to the interstitium and alveolar space. The chest radiograph often shows a rapid presentation of patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidations and ground-glass opacities. Poorly defined centrilobular nodules may also be present.",

Influenza A, the most virulent subtype, possesses eight negative-sense RNA segments that encode 11 known proteins. Of these proteins, two large viral surface glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), form the basis of multiple serologically distinct subtypes. To initiate infection, HA binds to sialic acid residues on the respiratory epithelial cell surface glycoproteins.21 Protease-mediated cleavage of HA results in its endocytosis, where the low pH of the endosome promotes uncoating of the virion and viral replication, eventually leading to the death of the epithelial cell.22 Once viral replication occurs, progeny virions are bound to the host cell. NA cleaves the links between the virions and host cell.23 Recently, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified in wild water birds, the natural host for all influenza A viruses.24\n",

Influenza A viruses that infect humans are from three major subtypes of HA (H1, H2, H3) and two subtypes of NA (N1 and N2). When NA or HA undergo stepwise point mutations in the RNA gene segments as the virus replicates, antigenic drift occurs.25 When two different viruses coinfect a single host, this host can act as a \u201cmixing vessel\u201d and a new virus is created by reassortment of the genomic segments.26 Major changes such as these antigenic shifts can cause epidemics and pandemics.",

Primary influenza pneumonia presents with dyspnea, persistent high fever, and significant hypoxia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a common complication of influenza and is responsible for 25% of all influenza deaths.39 These patients usually present with recurrence of fever and new respiratory symptoms after the initial viral syndrome has begun to abate. Increasingly, concomitant influenza and bacterial pneumonia is being recognized, with a significantly higher mortality, especially with S aureus. S aureus can express cytotoxins, such as Panton-Valentin leukocidin, that have the ability to cause severe necrotizing pneumonia both directly through direct toxic activity and indirectly through the upregulation of surface proteins.40 The mortality associated from the Panton-Valentin leukocidin\u2013associated staphylococcal infection ranges from 56% to 61%. Myositis and rhabdomyolysis often present with significant tenderness of the muscles along with elevated creatine phosphokinase levels, myoglobinuria, and renal failure.41 Central nervous involvement may include transverse myelitis,41 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome,41 aseptic meningitis,41 and encephalitis.41\n",

In adults, the reported incidence of varicella pneumonia is approximately 1 in every 400 cases.170 Although the incidence of varicella pneumonia has decreased significantly since the introduction of the vaccine, most morbidity and mortality seen from varicella infection in adults are from pneumonia. The decrease in adult pneumonia is likely secondary to herd immunity from child immunization rather than adult immunization.171 Despite the lower incidence, mortality from varicella pneumonia in immunocompetent individuals is staggering (up to 25%).172 Risk factors for the development of varicella pneumonia include cigarette smoking, immunocompromised state, and pregnancy.173, 174, 175 Overall, the severity of varicella pneumonia is highest in immunosuppressed individuals (mortality, 15%\u201318%) and in pregnant women in the second and third trimesters (mortality, 41%). Although only 0.1% of varicella infections develop in patients who are immunosuppressed, they accounted for approximately 25% of varicella-related deaths before the development of the vaccine.176 The incidence and complication rates have decreased because of early initiation of acyclovir for high-risk individuals and vaccination of those in close contact with people who are immunosuppressed and were not candidates for varicella vaccination.177\n",
