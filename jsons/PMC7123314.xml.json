He reported he was usually in good health until the current symptoms began. Scott said that he had been unable to swallow solid foods over the past week, largely due to increasing pain on swallowing, and was now unable to swallow liquids as well. Although he stated that his appetite was unchanged, he estimated a five-pound weight loss over the last week due to poor oral intake. He otherwise denied fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, or any other complaints. He takes no medications at home except for rare acetaminophen. He is married, has a two-year-old son, and works as an attorney. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Family history was noncontributory.",

His wife was asked to step out of the room while the medical resident asked Scott some further questions. The resident told Scott that she was concerned that he had primary syphilis based on his ulceration and adenopathy and stated he should be tested for that as well as for HIV, given his thrush. When she pressed Scott for information about his sexual history he initially hesitated, but then acknowledged that he had in fact had sexual relations with a female prostitute, \u201cbut only once.\u201d He consented to tests for HIV-1 antibodies and syphilis, but begged the resident \u201cplease don't tell my wife.\u201d Both tests came back positive shortly thereafter. When Scott learned the news, he admitted to the medical resident that he has also had sexual relations with a woman at his office. He again implored that his test results not be shared with his wife or his other sexual partners.\nQuestions for thought and discussion: What are the obligations of the medical resident for reporting the positive HIV and syphilis test results? Who do these results get reported to? Who notifies the sexual partners of patients who test positive for sexually transmitted infections?\nQuestion for thought and discussion: When should patient confidentiality be broken, even if it is against the patient's wishes?\n",

Despite national campaigns designed to encourage people to get tested for HIV, around one-quarter of those infected are unaware of their diagnosis and many persons are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease. In a 2005 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) it was estimated that 39 percent of patients diagnosed with HIV are subsequently diagnosed with AIDS in less than 12 months. Among AIDS-defining illnesses (see Table 12.1), esopha-geal Candidiasis is one of relatively high incidence. Identifying patients with HIV infection prior to their developing an HIV-related illness would be beneficial and allow antiretroviral treatment to be initiated earlier. One way in which early diagnosis of HIV infection may be better achieved is through more aggressive screening at the primary care provider level. In one study by Gao, et al. it was found that only 28 percent of the over 3,000 patients surveyed were asked about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at their last routine health visit.\n",

The greatest increases have been in men, particularly those having sex with other men (MSM). According to one study by Ciesielski and Boghani, MSM who have syphilis are 10 times more likely than heterosexual males with syphilis to be coinfected with HIV. The chancres caused by syphilis disrupt the natural barriers against HIV infection and increase susceptibility to HIV infection by up to five times. STIs such as syphilis are indicative of risk-taking behavior that is associated with increased transmission of HIV.",

About 8 percent is due to high risk heterosexual contact. Although Scott is married to a woman and claims to have had high risk heterosexual encounters, he should be specifically questioned about having past sexual relations with other men. MSM is a grouping which includes persons who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or heterosexual and, hence, includes men that may also have sexual relations with women. Sociocultural stigmatization of homosexuality, particularly in certain minority groups, may prevent some MSM from self-identifying as gay or bisexual. Some men who proclaim themselves to be heterosexual may admit to being \u201con the down low,\u201d an expression referring to those men who occasionally also have sex with other men. Nonjudgmentally asking a patient \u201cdo you have sex with men, women, or both?\u201d is probably the best way to obtain such sexual history information during the medical interview.",

They will also attempt to determine who the patient may have, through sufficient contact, exposed to the disease. Although they are strongly encouraged to do so, the patient is not required by law to divulge all sexual contacts to the investigator.

However, when a patient's known disease presents an imminent threat to the health or life of others, then confidentiality must be broken. Similar to the precedent established in the case of Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, there is a duty to protect the safety of an intended victim that supersedes the duty to maintain a patient's right to confidentiality. Anyone who has sexual relations with or engages in other risk behaviors with Scott is at risk for contracting HIV and syphilis, and protecting the health and welfare of those contact persons takes precedent over maintaining Scott's confidentiality. Additionally, if Scott knowingly exposes others to HIV, this may be considered a crime in some states, although individual state laws are variable regarding what qualifies as criminal activity in this regard. Health care practitioners should specifically learn the law of their state of practice regarding this issue. Due to variability in state laws regarding mandatory reporting of HIV status by patients to persons with occupational exposure to bodily fluids (e.g., dental hygienists, nurses, physicians, etc.), the use of universal contact precautions is always prudent.",

This conclusion can be justified by comparing the harms that would be done and the harms that would be prevented by violating confidentiality in this case. Scott will be harmed emotionally. He may feel angry and betrayed. His relationship with his wife may be ruined and may even end. On the other hand, if Scott's wife is informed, then she can get tested for syphilis and HIV, seek treatment if she has been infected, and if not infected, she can take steps to protect herself from becoming so. The harm prevented, then, is the harm of serious and life-threatening illness.",
