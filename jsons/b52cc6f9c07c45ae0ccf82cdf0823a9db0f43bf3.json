Therefore, the aim of the study was to gain a better insight into the development dynamics of certain bacterial groups during the first week of life. Methods and Results: Faecal samples of healthy Simmental calves (dualpurpose breed; n = 80), bottle fed and raised in a dairy farm were taken immediately after birth and at 6/12/24/48/72/168 h (h) after birth. Samples were analysed using cultural, biochemical and molecular-biological methods. The aerobe, anaerobe, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus counts of healthy calves increased significantly between 6 and 24 h postpartum (P <0\u00c105). Apart from the anaerobes, bacterial counts decreased after reaching a plateau at 24-48 h. Enterococcus faecalis was detected in significantly higher counts compared to E. faecium (P <0\u00c105). Lactobacilli developed more slowly and increased until day 7 after birth to a mean value of 6\u00c18 9 10 7 CFU per g. MALDI-TOF analysis of 2338 lactobacilli isolates resulted in 36 different species. Conclusions: Lactobacillus reuteri became the most common Lactobacillus sp. during the first week of life.

However, this observation coincides with the investigations of Ducluzeau (1983) , who had determined bacterial counts between 'not detectable' and up to 10 8 CFU per g in human meconium. While it has previously been assumed that the gastrointestinal tract of mammalian foetuses is sterile at birth (Mackie et al. 1999) , there is recent evidence that a prenatal transfer of maternal bacteria may occur to the foetus (Jim enez et al, 2005; Jim enez et al. 2008; Alipour et al. 2018) . However, since humans, mice and ruminants have a different placental structure, prenatal germ transmission might be differentif possible at all.

Although the faecal samples were stored chilled immediately after collection, it is still possible for some bacteria to grow until the time of the examination (maximum 48 h).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 431, "text": "Ducluzeau (1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 650, "end": 670, "text": "(Mackie et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 768, "end": 790, "text": "(Jim enez et al, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 791, "end": 812, "text": "Jim enez et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 813, "end": 833, "text": "Alipour et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Enterobacteria (with E. coli being their most common representative) and enterococci achieved high bacterial counts within the first 24 h after birth, but decreased again after reaching a peak at 48 h. The lactobacilli, on the other hand, developed more slowly, but continued to increase until the 7th day after birth and finally surpassed the enterococci. The observed bacterial counts and courses of bacterial counts of the present study broadly agree with those of other authors (Smith and Crabb 1961; Smith 1965; Vlkov a et al. 2008) . This consistent development of the different bacterial genera could be related to the fact that the pH values of the gastric contents are still relatively high immediately after birth. This promotes the proliferation of bacteria, particularly those (Smith 1965) . By lowering the gastric pH (approximately on the second day of life), the lactobacilli finally gain a selection advantage because they can grow at lower pH values. These bacteria subsequently become the dominant members of the stomach and small intestine microbiota, but also colonize the colon (Smith 1965) . At the age of 20 weeks, the lactobacilli finally represent the dominant bacterial genus in all intestinal compartments, including caecum and colon (Vlkova et al. 2006) . A closer look at the enterobacteria revealed that the proportion of lactose-positive germs was still below 40% at the time of birth, but increased to more than 80% of the total number of enterobacteria after 6 h already. A similar course results when comparing E. coli (which represents the major part of the lactose-positive Enterobacteriaceae in the present study) with other enterobacteria. The lactose-negative enterobacteria detected during the first sampling times were mostly germs of the genera Pantoea, followed by Hafnia and Serratia. As Pantoea spp., especially P. agglomerans, are associated with plants (Dutkiewicz et al. 2016) , we presume primarily a contamination from the farm environment. Especially in newborns, allochthonous bacterial species can be detected, which normally occur in habitats other than the gastrointestinal tract (Mackie et al. 1999) . Therefore, the identified lactose-negative enterobacteria of the present study might only be intestinal passersby. The species identification of enterococci showed that both E. faecalis and representatives of the E. nonfaecalis/nonfaecium group could be detected regularly and in high numbers in the faeces of healthy calves. The occurrence of enterococci in the faeces of calves is well documented (Devriese et al. 1992) . However, no data on their developmental kineticsespecially E. faecalis and E. faecium -in the faeces of newborn calf are available in the literature. It is noteworthy that E. faecium, a species which is used as a probiotic for calves, could only be found infrequently and in low counts in our study, where only healthy calves were included.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 482, "end": 504, "text": "(Smith and Crabb 1961;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 505, "end": 516, "text": "Smith 1965;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 517, "end": 537, "text": "Vlkov a et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 789, "end": 801, "text": "(Smith 1965)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1111, "text": "(Smith 1965)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1281, "text": "(Vlkova et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1924, "text": "(Dutkiewicz et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2155, "text": "(Mackie et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2557, "end": 2579, "text": "(Devriese et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "MALDI-TOF analysis of the colonies isolated from LAMVAB agar resulted in the detection of 36 different species. The predominant number of isolates (2039 out of 2388) could be identified as Lactobacillus spp). As confirmed by Gram staining, LAMVAB agar also allowed the growth of cocci which were identified as Leuconostoc spp., Lactococcus spp. and Pediococcus spp. by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (Table 1) . Particularly frequently, isolates of the early sampling times could not be assigned to any species, presumably because there were no corresponding entries in the database of the MALDI-TOF-MS device. Especially with regard to the question, which bacteria play a central role as primary settler, a further species analysis (preferably with molecular biological methods) would be extremely interesting. The development of the individual Lactobacillus spp. is subject to considerable variations. At the sampling times 0 and 6 h, L. brevis and L. plantarum were detected most frequently, but were outnumbered by other Lactobacillus species as early as 12 h postpartum. L. paracasei dominates at 12 and 24 h, but is replaced by L. murinus and L. reuteri after 48 h. Finally, on the 7th day after birth, the number of L. reuteri exceeds the number of all other detected lactobacilli species significantly (P < 0\u00c105). The investigation of newborn piglets showed that the lactobacilli population is undergoing a continuous change and that the dominant Lactobacillus type is changing within the first week of life (Tannock 2001) . Studies on lactobacilli populations of calves are rare. Soto et al. (2010) found L. salivarius as being the dominant species in six young calves (without a specification of age), while Busconi et al. (2008) ) identified L. mucosae in two 65-day-old animals. In the present study, L. salivarius and L. mucosae were also detected within the first week of life (Table 2) . However, our results demonstrate that L. reuteri is the dominant Lactobacillus sp. in the faeces of calves in the second half of the first week of life. This fact seems to be very important for the calf's intestinal health as L. reuteri showed in vitro bactericidal effects against Shigella sp., enterovirulent E. coli and Vibrio cholerae (Li evin-Le Moal and Servin 2014), as well as anti-infective activities against rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum (Alak et al. 1997; Seo et al. 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1507, "end": 1521, "text": "(Tannock 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1598, "text": "Soto et al.
