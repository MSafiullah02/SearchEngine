The continuing evolution of the virus is the cause of seasonal epidemics and, from time to time, of pandemics in the human population. Furthermore, due to appearance of influenza-like illnesses, diagnosis of this disease on the basis of clinical symptoms is possible only during the outbreak. It should be noted that in case of respiratory infections various clinical symptoms can be caused by the same virus and, on the other hand, the same set of symptoms can be caused by more than 200 different viruses (e.g. parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus). For this reason, the laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection is crucial in the influenza surveillance and is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Laboratory diagnosis of influenza includes confirmation of the presence of influenza virus antigen in the material collected from the patient and serological evidence of infection with influenza virus by detecting the increase of specific antibodies in patient\u2019s serum (Brydak 2008).",

Furthermore, evolution of influenza virus is most evident in the case of these surface proteins. HA and NA antigens are constantly changing due to antigenic pressure. They both are highly immunogenic, and antibodies produced in response to viral infection are specific for a particular subtype of hemagglutinin (H1-H18) and neuraminidase (N1-N11) and do not give complete protection against all influenza virus strains (Nicholson et al. 1998). The presence of hemagglutinin antibodies (anti-HA) provides not only protection against infection with specific strains of influenza virus, but also might alleviate symptoms of the disease in case of infection with another variant of the virus. This is caused by the occurrence of so-called cross-reactive antibodies. It has been shown that subtype-specific anti-HA antibodies can decrease the infectivity of the virus of other subtype by disruption of proliferation and release of viral particles during infection (Ekiert et al. 2011; Epstein and Price 2010; Thorsby et al. 2008). For this reason, regular vaccinations are essential for reducing the impact of seasonal influenza and influenza prevention. Seasonal vaccinations protect from infection with currently circulating viruses and give cross-protection, which can reduce viral replication, accelerate viral clearance, and thus reduce the severity of disease. The World Health Organization leads the global influenza surveillance and gives seasonal recommendations for influenza virus strains included in the vaccine for the upcoming epidemic season.",

Furthermore, this value of titer, after vaccination, is required by European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for assessment of vaccines (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products 1997). On the other hand, the anti-NA antibodies, even at high titers, only support the resistance because they do not prevent influenza infection themselves. However, it has been shown that the anti-NA antibodies block the replication process, alleviate the severity of infection, and reduce the incidence of disease (Brydak 2008).",

Serological tests are used not only for diagnostic purposes, but also to evaluate the resistance of the population resulting from both, natural infection and vaccination against influenza. Most laboratories use the hemagglutination inhibition test for serological diagnosis. The method is based on the ability of anti-HA antibodies to inhibit virus-induced agglutination of erythrocytes (WHO \u2013 Global Influenza Surveillance Network 2011). It is a simple, inexpensive, and rapid test, during which a small amount of reagents is used. Due to the high cost and labor-consumption, not many laboratories determines the level of antibodies with neuraminidase inhibition test (Brydak 2008).",

Thereafter, these data in the form of weekly reports are sent to the National Institute of Public Health \u2013 National Institute of Hygiene by Voivodeship Sanitary Epidemiological Stations. There are two types of influenza vaccines, which are currently available in Poland: inactivated split virion and subunit. Split type vaccine contains inactivated split virus, whereas subunit type contains only viral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. It should be noted that already for many influenza seasons, numerous local governments offer free influenza vaccinations for people over 50 years of age, who often belong to high-risk groups of health. Despite this, the proportion of people vaccinated is diminishing season by season. In the epidemic season 2013/2014 only 3.75 % of the population was vaccinated against influenza (Brydak 2014).",

The comparison of protection rates for hemagglutinin H1 of A/California/7/2009pdm09 strain is especially interesting. This type of A influenza virus has been circulating in the population since 2009. In the age groups of 4\u20137, 26\u201344, 45\u201364, and \u226565 years there has been a significant increase in the protection rate compared to the previous two seasons. In the youngest age group this value is higher in comparison to the last season, but lower than in the 2011/2012 season. However, in groups of 8\u201314 and 15\u201325 years old the protection rates remain at a similar level in all analyzed seasons. In the case of H3 hemagglutinin of A/Victoria/361/2011 strain the protection rate increased in the age group 4\u20137, decreased in the age group 26\u201344, and did not change significantly in the group of 8\u201314 years, compared to the previous two epidemiological seasons. There has been a significant increase in the values of this factor in groups 15\u201325, 45\u201364, and \u226565 years old as compared to the epidemic season 2012/2013. With regard to the last season, value of protection rate substantially increased in the youngest group. A significant increase in protection rates was observed in four age groups: 0\u20133, 4\u20137, 15\u201325, and 26\u201344 for influenza B virus strain B/Massachusetts/2/2012 in epidemic season 2013/2014. In other age groups these values were similar to 2011/2012 season and lower than in previous season.\n",

These results are truly alarming as it shows that the value of protection rate against influenza in the Polish population is very low. The complications of influenza may be hazardous to health and life-threatening to persons who are not vaccinated, especially in the very young, the elderly, and those with other serious medical conditions. Influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection, but this fact is ignored by many people. It can be concluded, on the basis of serological screening of sera from people at different age groups in the epidemic season 2013/2014, that:our results confirm the circulation of three antigenically different influenza strains: two subtypes of influenza A virus \u2013 A/California/7/2009(H1N1)pdm09 and A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) \u2013 and type B, B/Massachusetts/2/2012;protection rate did not exceed 60 % in any age group, which demonstrates that the proportion of people vaccinated against influenza in Poland is very low. This situation can be changed when more people will vaccinate against influenza.\n",
