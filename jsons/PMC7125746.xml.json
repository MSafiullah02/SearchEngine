            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, and has been assigned to the genus Avulavirus in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae\n[1]. It causes a serious respiratory and neurological disease in all species of birds and is an economically important infectious agent, causing substantial losses to the poultry industry. Newcastle disease varies in the degree of severity, ranging from an inapparent infection to severe disease causing 100% mortality. NDV strains cause a continuous spectrum of disease and can be categorized into three main pathotypes depending on the severity of disease produced in chickens. Strains of low virulence, known as the lentogenic strains, cause mild or inapparent disease in birds. Mesogenic strains are viruses with intermediate virulence, which cause respiratory and/or neurological signs. Highly virulent NDV strains causing high mortality in birds are called velogenic. Velogenic strains can be further sub-divided into two categories: viscerotropic velogenic strains that produce lethal infections in which hemorrhagic lesions are prominent; and neurotropic velogenic strains that produce high mortality preceded by neurological signs, with the absence of hemorrhagic lesions [2].",

            "text": "The genome of NDV is a single stranded negative-sense RNA consisting of 15,186 nucleotides [3]. The genomic RNA contains six genes that encode at least seven proteins [4], [5]. The envelope of NDV contains two glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins. The HN glycoprotein is involved in attachment and release of virus and the F glycoprotein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes [6]. Mutational analysis has shown that the fusion peptide and the adjacent heptad repeat region play a role in the fusion activity of F protein [7]. This protein is synthesized as a precursor, F0, which must be proteolytically cleaved to F1 and F2 to activate fusion [6], [8]. Cleavage of the F protein is known to be required for initiation of infection and is considered to be a major determinant of NDV virulence. Cleavage of the F protein of virulent NDV strains occurs by ubiquitous subtilisin-like proteases such as furin, PC6 and PACE 4; whereas, cleavage in avirulent strains occurs by trypsin-like enzymes found in limited tissues [9].",

The resultant mutated LaSota virus (LaSota V.F.) did not require exogenous trypsin for infectivity in cell culture, indicating that the F protein was cleaved by intracellular proteases. Intracerebral inoculation of this mutated recombinant virus to 1-day-old chicks showed some gain in neurovirulence; however, intranasal inoculation into three and 6-week-old chickens did not cause any neurological disease. These observations suggested that the cleavage efficiency of the F protein might contribute to neurovirulence if the virus is delivered artificially into the brain, but determinants in other regions of the NDV genome may be required for neurovirulence via natural route of infection.",

The replication of rBC, rLaSota, and rLaSota V.F. viruses in the brains of 1-day-old chicks after intracerebral inoculation was measured (Fig. 3). The rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses initiated new virus formation after one day of infection. However, the yields of rBC virus were 100-fold higher than those of rLaSota V.F. virus. By day 4, all birds inoculated with rBC were dead. The replication kinetics of rLaSota virus was delayed and the virus yields were lower than those of rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses. These results suggested that intracellular cleavage of the F protein is important for replication of NDV in the brains of chicks, but, probably, other viral factors are necessary for efficient replication. The genetic stability of the mutations introduced into the genome of LaSota V.F. virus was determined by sequence analysis of the RT-PCR fragment that covered the region of the F protein cleavage site of the mutant virus that was passed five times in 9-day-old chicken embryos, and also from the mutant virus that was passaged once in chicken brains.

            "text": "To examine the role of growth temperature in replication and biological activities of rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses, the viruses were grown in primary chicken neuronal cells at two different temperatures. It was found that the rBC virus grew faster and induced a more rapid cytopathic effect at 41.5 \u00b0C (body temperature of chickens) than at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 4A). To prove that the growth temperature does play a role in replication kinetics, we tested the growth of neurovirulent rBC virus by a multi-step growth curve in Vero cells at 37 and 41.5 \u00b0C. The results showed that the rBC virus replicated to higher titers at 41.5 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 4B). The rBC virus also produced more cytopathic effects in chicken neuronal cells at 41.5 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C, as evidenced by the destruction of the cell monolayers (Fig. 5A). Our results showed that chicken neuronal cells are more susceptible to rBC than Vero cells. At 41.5 \u00b0C, rBC in chicken neuronal cells grew to higher titers at 24 h post-infection. At 48 h and 56 h post-infection the rBC titer in chicken neuronal cells was lower at 41.5 \u00b0C, because most of the cells were destroyed at this temperature and at these time points. Hemadsorption (HAd) studies revealed higher HAd of rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses at 41.5 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C. HAd activity of rBC at 41.5 \u00b0C was 128% when compared to its activity at 37 \u00b0C (100% HAd activity), while rLaSota V.F. had a HAd activity of 14% at 37 \u00b0C and 70% at 41.5 \u00b0C. Virus-binding studies with purified biotinylated virus in a streptavidin-colloidal gold amplification system indicated that the binding of chicken neuronal cells by rBC was significantly higher than rLaSota V.F.

The ICPI results showed that the modification of the F protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from ICPI value of 0.00 for rLaSota to ICPI value of 1.12 (out of a maximum possible value of 2.0) for rLaSota V.F. However, the virulence of rLaSota V.F. was lower than that of rBC virus (ICPI value of 1.58). Surprisingly, the results obtained by IVPI tests showed a different pattern. The rBC virus had an IVPI value of 1.45 (out of a maximum possible value of 3.00), but the IVPI values of rLaSota V.F. and rLaSota viruses were 0.00. These results demonstrated that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the central nervous system. The efficiency of attachment may, in part, determine the virulence, as indicated by our virus binding studies. To compare the pathogenesis of rBC, rLaSota and rLaSota V.F. viruses, 3-week-old chickens were infected intranasally with 103 plaque forming units (PFU) of virus. The virus distribution in different tissues of the inoculated birds are presented in Fig. 6\n. The rBC virus first appeared by day 3 in the blood, lungs, spleen and brain, and by day 5, the virus was undetectable in the blood. In the lungs, rBC grew to higher titers (500-fold) on day 5, but the titer was significantly reduced on day 7. It is possible that the humoral antibody IgA, which appears on day 5 post-infection and plays a major role in virus clearance in the respiratory tract, may be responsible for the decrease in virus titer seen on day 7. The rLaSota V.F. virus appeared by day 5 in the lungs and spleen, and in the blood by day 7, but was never detected in the brain. The rLaSota virus was detected only in the lungs by day 5. Sections of brain were also evaluated for the presence of viral RNA by in situ hybridization, using an antisense NP-specific 35S-labeled riboprobe (Fig. 7A). We found that only rBC virus exhibited focal areas of viral infection in the brain by days 5 and 7. These areas were mostly found in the cerebellum. Immunohistochemical studies using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies to the HN protein corroborated the results of hybridization (Fig. 7B). These results indicated that viral factors other than the cleavage efficiency of the F protein may determine the neurovirulence of NDV isolates, and that entry into the brain is an important factor.",

The amino acid sequence at the F protein cleavage site has been postulated as a major determinant of NDV virulence [10]. Fewer basic amino acids are present in the F protein cleavage site of lentogenic NDV strains than in the proteins of either mesogenic or velogenic NDV strains, which have a similar multi-basic cleavage site sequence [11], [13]. Recently, using reverse genetics techniques, others have also observed that changing the F protein cleavage site of an avirulent NDV strain to the consensus F protein cleavage site of virulent strains only slightly increased the virulence [14]. These results indicated that cleavage efficiency is not the sole determinant governing NDV neurovirulence. The idea that \u2018cleavability\u2019 of the viral penetration protein is not necessarily the major determinant of virulence is illustrated by the recent sequence analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic virus, which showed that this highly virulent virus did not have a \u2018highly cleavable\u2019 HA protein and, hence, the determinants of virulence lay elsewhere and remain to be identified [15].",

The role of HN in affecting virus pathotype is seen in lentogenic and avirulent NDV strains, like Ulster, which have a longer reading frame consisting of 616 amino acids, as opposed to the neurovirulent, mesogenic strain BC, which has a shorter reading frame of 577 amino acids in the HN protein [10].

The F protein cleavage site of lentogenic and avirulent NDV strain LaSota was altered and made identical to the F protein cleavage site of mesogenic and neurovirulent NDV strain BC. The amino acid sequence G-R-Q-G-R present at the cleavage site of the F protein of avirulent NDV strain LaSota was altered to R-R-Q-K-R, to be analogous to the cleavage site of the F protein of neurovirulent strain BC (Fig. 1). This was done by subcloning the Sac II-Not I fragment from pLaSota into a plasmid vector, pGEM-7Z (+) (Promega, Madison, WI). This subclone was designated Sac II-Not I pLaSota 7Z. The F cleavage site of pLasota was then made identical to that of pBC by site-directed mutagenesis [34], with phosphorylated forward primer (5\u2032-4886aaaCGCtTTATAGGCGCCATTATTGGCG4913-3\u2032) and phosphorylated reverse primer (5\u2032-4885CTGTCTCCtCCCTCCAGATGTAGT4862-3\u2032, lower case representing mutation), on Sac II-Not I pLaSota 7Z.

To confirm the presence of the desired mutations at the F cleavage site and the absence of any undesired mutations in pLaSota V.F., it was sequenced to its entirety. Using reverse genetics procedures [11], [33], the recombinant virus rLaSota V.F. was recovered from its cDNA clone, pLaSota V.F.",

The inoculation was done using a 27-guage needle, attached to a 1 ml stepper syringe dispenser that was set to dispense 0.05 ml of inoculum per inoculation. The birds were inoculated by inserting the needle up to the hub into the right or left rear quadrant of the cranium.
