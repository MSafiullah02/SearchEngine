In the large-scale retrospective North American cohort, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), Armstrong and colleagues reported significant excess rates of death due to pulmonary disease (standard mortality ratio, 8.8), second only to death from second malignant neoplasms [1]. Pulmonary toxicity is frequently reported in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, germ cell tumors, acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and metastatic Wilms tumor survivors, as the chemotherapy, radiation and surgeries used to treat these pediatric cancer (among others) can result in permanent lung damage [2, 3]. This damage can manifest as acute pneumonitis, late onset fibrosis, and structurally induced dysfunction from developmental abnormalities due to impaired growth of the thorax attributable to surgery or radiation. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary problems after childhood cancer increases with time since diagnosis, as with other late-effects, suggesting that survivors are at an elevated risk of developing later-onset pulmonary morbidities as they age [4].",

            "text": "The lungs are particularly sensitive to radiation. Pulmonary late effects occur most often in patients with malignant diseases of the chest that are treated with radiation, i.e., those involving the mediastinum, the lung parenchyma or the chest wall. These survivors typically include those treated with chest or mantle field radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or sarcoma, and those whose primary disease metastasized to the lung (i.e., Wilms tumor). In one of the largest studies of pulmonary outcomes among adult childhood cancer survivors exposed to pulmonary toxic therapy, Mulder and colleagues demonstrated that radiation was the most important risk factor for pulmonary late effects [5]. In those exposed directly or indirectly to lung radiation, abnormal radiographic findings or restrictive changes on pulmonary function testing have been reported in more than 30 % of patients. In addition to radiation dose and the volume of lung in the radiation field, fractionation and younger age at therapy are risk factors for toxicity. Radiation can inflict damage directly to the lung tissue, and at higher doses, inhibit chest wall growth. This leads to diminished lung volumes and ultimately to restrictive lung disease, particularly when patients are young children at the time of therapy. In the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, Mertens reported that survivors exposed to chest radiation have a five-fold increased risk of abnormal chest wall development (RR = 5.0; 95 % CI, 2.7\u20139.4), an over fourfold excess risk of lung fibrosis (RR = 4.3; 95 % CI, 2.9\u20136.6) and an over twofold risk of chronic pneumonia (RR = 2.2; 95 % CI, 1.5\u20137.0) [4].",

            "text": "Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis is a risk factor for long-term lung dysfunction as the acute changes associated with this condition often evolve to pulmonary fibrosis. Acute pneumonitis is usually only observed in patients who receive higher radiation doses (>30 Gy) to a significant portion of their lungs and is an uncommon outcome with contemporary therapy [6]. In these high doses, radiation toxicity is characterized by acute radiation pneumonitis, occurring within 1\u20133 months after radiation. Cough, pink sputum, dyspnea and pleuritis are common complaints during this subacute pneumonitis phase. When pulmonary-toxic chemotherapy (i.e., busulfan or melphalan) is combined with total body irradiation (e.g., for stem cell transplantation conditioning), reactions can occur during treatment. As mentioned, the acute changes of radiation pneumonitis may result in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This fibrotic phase of injury can start within 3\u20136 months of post radiation completion, stabilizes after 1\u20132 years but can present clinically years following treatment. When symptomatic, pulmonary fibrosis usually presents with exertional dyspnea as well as chronic, non-productive cough. These clinical changes may be progressive, static or resolve over time. However, it is important to note, the majority of chest RT survivors are clinically asymptomatic. And yet while asymptomatic, many of these survivors may demonstrate sub-clinical radiographic and pulmonary function testing abnormalities, including diffusion capacity or abnormal restrictive or obstructive patterns that are common even after lower radiation doses [7].",

Early studies on the outcomes of metastatic Wilms tumor survivors have shown that whole lung irradiation mainly affects the lung parenchyma and results in reduced lung volume, impaired lung compliance and hypoplasia and deformity of both the lung and chest wall [8\u201310]. In a series of metastatic Wilms tumor survivors treated with whole lung irradiation (15 Gy in 10\u201314 daily fractions) combined with actinomycin, survivors had small lung volumes but normal gas transfer per unit lung volume when compared to predicted age and height reference ranges, suggesting that while lung RT results in chest wall underdevelopment, diffuse lung fibrosis is not significant at this dose level.",

The majority of these studies indicate asymptomatic restrictive lung disease in up to 30\u201340 % of those survivors exposed to chest radiation. Bossi and colleagues described the pulmonary outcomes of 27 pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma survivors and found that exposure to less than 20 Gy of mediastinal radiation was not associated with an increased risk of lung dysfunction. However, in patients who received over 20 Gy of mediastinal radiation and higher cumulative doses of bleomycin, pulmonary diffusion capacity was impaired [15]. In a Danish population-based study of the pulmonary function of survivors of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 41), Nysom and colleagues found that at a median of 11 years after diagnosis, total lung capacity and the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were reduced in both radiated and non-radiated patients who had received chemotherapy. Survivors who were treated with radiation at a young age were particularly at risk [16]. These findings have been confirmed in studies that demonstrated that combined treatment with chest radiation and bleomycin for Hodgkin lymphoma increases the risk of a persistent decrease in diffusion capacity [17, 18].",

The most common finding on pulmonary function testing is restrictive lung disease, sometimes associated with a decrease in DLCO [2]. In a cohort of 89 childhood cancer survivors post allogeneic HSCT, Inaba reported progressive worsening of pulmonary function as measured by forced mid-expiratory flow (25\u201350 %), residual volume, total lung capacity (TLC), and DLCO. Obstructive lung disease is also observed in HSCT survivors. For example, Bruno reported that in a series of 80 children treated with allogeneic HSCT, mean FEV1/FVC values of less than 60 % of predicted were observed in patients whose chronic graft versus host disease persisted 5 years after transplant.",

As such, for all bleomycin-exposed survivors and for all survivors with symptomatic pulmonary toxicity or abnormal PFTs after exposure to other pulmonary toxic therapy, an anesthesia consult should be obtained prior to any surgical procedures.
