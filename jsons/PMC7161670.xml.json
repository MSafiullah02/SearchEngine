            "text": "Influenza A viruses are unique in their ability to cause not only seasonal yearly\noutbreaks, but also periodic global epidemics \u2013 often called pandemics. In the past\ncentury, there have been three pandemics (1918, 1957 and 1968), one of which \u2013 the\ninfamous \u201cSpanish flu\u201d of 1918 \u2013 was responsible for 450,000 deaths in the US and 50\u2013100\nmillion worldwide (Last, 1986; Potter, 1998; EURO ELSAV, 2002; Osterholm, 2005). A\npandemic will likely occur again when the virus undergoes a major change, a so-called\nantigenic shift, and this will make the whole population of the world, even those who\nacquired immunity from annual outbreaks, highly susceptible. Although unable to predict\nthe exact time or severity of the next pandemic, most experts agree that it may occur at\nany time (Dowdle, 2001). The United States\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that in the US, when it will occur,\n40\u2013100 million persons will become ill, 300,000\u2013800,000 persons will be hospitalized,\nand 88,000\u2013300,000 persons will die (Meltzer, Cox,\n& Fukuda, 2000). A more recent estimate, based on the probability that the\ncurrent avian flu strain H5NI could lead to a pandemic that would mimic the one of 1918,\nputs the possible death toll to 1.7 million in the United States alone (Osterholm, 2005). It is to be expected that\nillnesses and deaths, combined with the population's reaction to them, will cause a\nmajor disruption to social and economic life as well as to national and international\ninfrastructures. In anticipation of and in response to a possible pandemic, many\ncountries in the world have been developing coordinated strategies that represent major,\ncomplex, public policies that in turn will affect the life of virtually every\ncitizen.",

There appears to be a\nconsensus that the most useful tool to keep people well during a pandemic is an\neffective vaccine \u2013 if one can be successfully developed (Ghendon, 1994). But, production of a vaccine can only start after\nthe pandemic virus is identified. This is a slow and complex process, so that the first\nbatches will likely be available only four to six months after the new virus is\nisolated. Because, in the early stages of a pandemic, the influenza vaccine will be in\nshort supply, a regular feature of pandemic plans is a prioritization scheme. The\npandemic plans of Canada (Health Canada, 2004),\nthe US (United States Department of Health and Human\nServices, 2004) and the UK (Departments,\n2005) all have identified health care workers as the highest priority group.\nThere is a strong probability that, if the pandemic virus is proven to be highly lethal,\neveryone who will be given an opportunity to receive the new vaccine will gladly accept\nit. However, if the new virus is not likely to cause deaths to healthy people of middle\nage, or if the efficacy or safety of the vaccine is suspicious, then health care workers\nmay not embrace the idea of a preventive vaccination. Yet, in such situations, there may\nbe strong epidemiological and operational reasons to make it desirable for all staff\nmembers that are in patient contact to be immunized.",

It was estimated, at a recent meeting of the US\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that only 36% of hospital workers are\nvaccinated each year against influenza (Fox,\n2004). The vaccination rate of Canadian health care workers during the\n2000\u20132001 influenza season was reported to be 55% (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2001). Will health care workers respond\ndifferently during a pandemic and will they all be voluntarily vaccinated? We do not\nknow. But, we do know that an unwillingness to accept vaccination will add to the\nalready worrisome \u201cethical barriers to preparedness\u201d (Wynia, 2003). To address this unpredictable factor, pandemic planners in\nUnited States and Canada are cautiously looking into the possibility of using a law to\nmake such a vaccination compulsory. Typically, the United States\u2019 guide for local- and\nstate-wide pandemic planning poses this question: \u201cDoes State law allow for \u2018mandatory\u2019\nvaccination of certain groups if vaccination of such groups is viewed by State public\nhealth officials as being \u2018essential\u2019 for public safety?\u201d (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2004).",

This issue is to be\nseen against the background of a larger ongoing debate that is taking place in most\ncountries between those who promote legally mandatory vaccinations for various\ninfectious diseases and those who insist that vaccination programs remain voluntary\n(Bradley, 1999; EURO ELSAV, 2002). Given that this is not a legal paper, and\naccepting the premise that \u201c(t)he law relating to public health should be based on\nethical values\u201d (Gostin, 2002), I will focus on\nthe ethical acceptability of mandatory vaccination of health care professionals. I will\nfirst examine some principal arguments suggesting that health care professionals have a\nmoral obligation to accept vaccination and that public health authorities have an\nethical obligation to assure that these people are vaccinated. I will consider if these\narguments can ever be used to justify the imposing of vaccination by law and examine\nboth the condition for such an imposition and the limits of enforcement. Then, I will\ndiscuss arguments that assert that vaccination during a pandemic must remain voluntary.\nFinally, I will make some general observations about these arguments, attempt to create\na balanced position and provide a tentative answer to the question posed in the title of\nthis paper.",

Three points\nsupport this argument. Firstly, to be a professional means to be someone who\nprofesses. Health professionals explicitly make such an act of profession when they\nare accepting an academic degree or graduating, but also, implicitly, on a daily\nbasis, in the community or organization where they accept patients. They are\nprofessing, that is, declaring their preparedness and readiness to serve the needs of\nothers (Pellegrino & Thomasma, 1988).\nThis duty, which every health care professional (in the strong sense of the word\n\u201cprofessional\u201d as advocated by Pellegrino and others) has taken on, is proportionate\nto the need for his or her services.",

The figures provided above indicate that, except for a major war, no other\nforeseeable incident would cause a comparable amount of suffering, death and social\ndisruption.

Therefore, a health care worker will likely encounter this situation only once or\ntwice in his or her professional career. Such a rare, but extremely severe situation\ncalls for a meticulous adherence to professional duties. The need for services will\nhardly ever be greater than in a pandemic situation, so, if there was ever a time to\ndemonstrate professionalism and a willingness to put the needs of others first, then\nit is at the time of a pandemic.

Also, a meta-analysis of\nnumerous clinical trials indicates that influenza vaccination is moderately effective\nin preventing influenza in the general population (Langley & Faughnan, 2004). Hence, if vaccination is available, then the\nhealth care worker has an obligation to receive it, unless it is medically\ncontraindicated.

            "text": "The second argument is based on the principle of nonmaleficence: do not cause\nunnecessary harm or expose patients to avoidable risks. Unvaccinated health care\nworkers pose a risk to others and could harm the very patients they care for, thus\nviolating this principle. If vaccination minimizes a risk to patients, then health\ncare workers have an obligation to accept it. The \u201cdo no harm\u201d principle is usually\napplied only to interventions that are carried out by health care workers, yet, it is\nobviously also relevant in situations where health care workers themselves can become\ninstruments of harm. It has been suggested that everyone has a moral obligation not to\ntransmit a communicable disease, if one can avoid it, even for such mild conditions as\na common cold (Harris & Holm, 1995). If\nthere is such an obligation, then it will have an even stronger moral claim on health\ncare staff than on other people (Rea & Upshur,\n2001). In order for this argument be valid, it needs to be shown that front\nline health care professionals who are not vaccinated will very likely get infected\nwith the virus, transfer the virus to their patients and cause illnesses or deaths of\npatients that would not otherwise occur. It has been difficult to obtain such evidence\nfor the annual influenza seasonal infections, but most observers feel that such\nevidence is now indeed available, and that the transfer of an influenza virus from\nstaff to patients is not just a theoretical risk. A recent report of the National\nFoundation for Infectious Diseases has identified this problem and has recorded a case\nstudy from a pediatric service (Fox, 2004).\nNursing home outbreaks have been traced to infected staff (Coles, Balzano, & Morse, 1992). A jury in a Coroner's Inquest\nin Ontario, Canada determined that staff had played a key role in an outbreak of\ninfluenza leading to deaths in a long-term care facility, and it called for mandatory\nvaccination (Marsh Canada Limited, 1999).\nThere are several studies suggesting that if health care workers in long-term care\nfacilities do get vaccinated, the overall death rate of residents in these facilities\nduring an influenza season is reduced (Patriarca et\nal., 1986; Potter et al., 1997;\nCarman et al., 2000). As a result, the\nAmerican and Canadian advisory committees on immunization practices and the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics recommend annual influenza vaccination for health care workers\n(McMillan, 2000). Researchers have also\nfound that about a third of front line health care workers develop symptoms during an\ninfluenza season and yet three-quarters of them do not stay home from work. It appears\nthat peer pressure in health care institutions persuades staff members to keep on\nworking unless an illness becomes seriously incapacitating. This behavior would be\ncommendable if it did not further increase the chances of patients getting exposed to\nthe virus (Herwaldt, 1993). The refusal to be\nvaccinated would be particularly ethically troublesome during a pandemic if the\nvaccine were made preferentially available to health care workers but not to the\ngeneral population from which patients come. Immunization against hepatitis B has been\nidentified to be an ethical obligation of health care providers, based on a duty not\nto expose patients to unacceptable risks (College of\nPhysicians and Surgeons of Ontario, 1998) and the same duty could be\npostulated to exist during an influenza pandemic.",

Historically, the prevention and\ncontrol of outbreaks of infectious diseases have been among the first tasks in the\npurview of public health services and still remains an important contribution to\npublic well-being. Failing to control an epidemic, if an opportunity to do so were\navailable, means failing an ethical obligation. The desire not to interfere with any\npersonal liberties is not sufficient justification to avoid taking action. Hence, if\nepidemiological knowledge concerning an influenza pandemic provides a strong\nindication that the burden to the population could be reduced by vaccination of health\ncare professionals, then it can be argued that public health service has an ethical\nobligation to take all reasonable measures necessary to vaccinate this group.",

This\nraises the complex issue of the relationship between ethics and law that cannot be\nelaborated upon here. It is also not possible to discuss the long history of\ncompulsory vaccination practices that in North America go back more than a hundred\nyears. It was in 1905, that the US Supreme Court examined a state-enacted, mandatory\nvaccination against smallpox, and held that the law was a legitimate exercise of the\nState's \u201cpolice power\u201d to protect the health of its citizens (Gostin, 2000; Welborn,\n2005). Since that time, this power of the state has been challenged many\ntimes or occasionally reduced, yet it has never disappeared (Parmet, Goodman, & Farber, 2005). The possibility of\nbioterrorism and new infectious diseases further advanced this cause, and mandatory\nvaccination is a measure recommended to all American states in the Model State\nEmergency Health Powers Act (Gostin et al.,\n2002).",

            "text": "However, a number of things could be said to weaken the above arguments favoring\nmandatory vaccination:(a)The influenza pandemic will not be a unique event and not likely that severe;\ntherefore, no extraordinary moral duties will be generated and no extraordinary\nmeasures should be taken. Experts tend to exaggerate the risk in order to draw\nattention and resources to the programs in which they are involved.(b)Public health officials are exaggerating the efficacy of a vaccination to alter\nthe course of a pandemic. Some critics maintain that the efficacy of the annual\ninfluenza vaccination of health care staff is at best only marginal (Nicholson, 2000; Demicheli, 2001), and vaccination during a pandemic has\nnever been scientifically tested, mainly because in previous pandemics there was\nnever enough vaccine available. Pandemic plans of Canada and US do not provide\nany indication as to what effectiveness could be achieved during a pandemic,\neven if a theoretical impact of vaccination was incorporated into some\ncalculation of economic consequences of pandemic (Meltzer, Cox, & Fukudo, 2000). Under those\ncircumstances the vaccine does not warrant any special moral or legal\nconsiderations.(c)A vaccine manufactured for a pandemic is not likely to be entirely safe, and\ntherefore, each potential recipient should be allowed to make a judgment based\non personal assessment of risks and benefits. Drug research is now market\ndriven, and a declaration by any party that a new vaccine is safe cannot be\ntrusted. \u201cTransparency has become a substitute for trust\u201d (Pope, 2003) and the processes of manufacturing and testing\nvaccines are not currently transparent. There will not be sufficient time in a\npandemic situation for proper clinical trials and, as a result, priority\nrecipients, like health care professionals, will in fact serve unwittingly as\nresearch subjects. New batches of vaccine sometimes have new side effects that\ncannot be anticipated, such as the oculorespiratory syndrome caused by a\nvaccination in 2001 (Skowronski, Bjornson,\nHusain, Metzger, & Scheifele, 2004). An unexpected risk of\nvaccination can sometimes emerge only many years later, as was the case with the\nvirus-contaminated polio vaccines (McCarthy,\n2002; Dang-Tan, Mahmud, Puntoni,\n& Franco, 2004). Reporting adverse events is not mandatory and\nthese events are likely underreported and underestimated.(d)There will be a scarcity of vaccine during a pandemic, and not even all those\nwho desire it will be able to receive it. Therefore, mandatory vaccination will\nbe unnecessary.(e)An infected health care worker will not be a significant source of infection\nbecause during a pandemic the virus will be ubiquitous.(f)Those health professionals who do not wish to be vaccinated could be offered\nprolonged prophylactic therapy with antiviral drugs, with benefits similar to\nvaccination.(g)Health care professionals will not be infecting their patients if they use\ninfection control procedures and if management policies do not effectively\nprevent health care workers from taking time off when ill (Diodati, 2002).(h)The notion of professionalism as used in some of the above arguments is\noutdated; contemporary health care professionals do not have more obligations\nthan workers in other sectors to guard their own health or avoid infecting\nothers.\n",

We can say that mandatory vaccination of health\ncare professionals would be a blatant and large-scale transgression of the most\nimportant principle of health care ethics. It would represent a severe and\nunacceptable affront to the personal liberty and autonomy of a whole class of\ncitizens. When a health care professional is facing a sharp end of a needle, he or she\nis a patient and deserves all the ethical considerations given to patients.\nVaccination without consent would be an attempted invasion of bodily integrity and as\nsuch, completely out of line with current standards of patient care. Treating health\ncare professionals in this way would simply be offensive. In support of this argument\ncould be cited voluminous literature; the defense of patients\u2019 self-determination has\nbeen a prevailing concern of bioethics for at least the first two decades of the\nhistory of this discipline since the term \u201cbioethics\u201d was coined in 1970s (Beauchamp & Childress, 2001). While the\nposition of this principle is perhaps less dominant, there are still strong voices\nsuggesting that this principle is the most important one, \u201cthe first among equals\u201d\n(Gillon, 2003). Even those theorists who\nare critical of the principle of respect for autonomy as a centerpiece of\n\u201cprinciplism\u201d agree that it is necessary to protect the patients\u2019 self-determination.\nThey would likely support the prohibition of mandatory vaccination along the same\nethical lines as breaking a rule like \u201cdo not deprive of freedom\u201d (Gert, Culver, & Clouser, 1997).",

It is argued that\nmandatory vaccination is unacceptable because it fails to respect the principle of\nleast infringement. There is another intervention, voluntary vaccination, which would\nachieve the goal of mandatory vaccination with less infringement on individual rights.\nThe proponent of this argument will have to admit that the equivalency of mandatory\nand voluntary vaccination in terms of outcome is not proven; however, it is also not\nproven that mandatory vaccination of professionals would achieve a higher success rate\nthan voluntary vaccination. In the absence of such evidence, one way or another, the\nleast infringing and least burdensome intervention must be preferred. This position\ncan be supported by numerous studies that indicate that undue concern about\nefficiency, adverse effects, misinformation, barriers and disincentives to vaccination\nwere factors that played a role in the current low rate of acceptance of influenza\nvaccination among health care staff. The same and other studies also reported an\nimprovement of vaccination rates among health care workers if some of these problems\nwere addressed (Harbath, Siegrist, Schira, Wunderli,\n& Pittet, 1998; Beguin, Boland, &\nNinane, 1989; Girasek, 1990; Eisenfeld et al., 1994; Nichol & Hauge, 1997; Tamblyn, 1997; Carman et al., 2000;\nHabib, Rishpon, & Rubin, 2000).\nGenerally, all these interventions to increase vaccination rates were a part of a\nresearch study and they were not permanent, system wide or comprehensive.",

With few exceptions, the ethical\nrelevance of vaccination has not been discussed in medical literature (Herwaldt, 1993; Rea & Upshur, 2001).

In\nrecent memory, two major national vaccination programs were launched as an emergency\nmeasure, yet eventually, these programs turned out to be unnecessary and risky. In\n1976, when a new strain of influenza with pandemic capacity was detected, 46 million\nAmericans and several million Canadians, on the urging of their governments, accepted\nemergency vaccination. But the vaccination campaign came to a premature halt because\nof the vaccine's side effects. On the final count, over 500 cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9\nsyndrome and 32 deaths were attributed in the US to this intervention. In addition,\nthe new virus was never detected outside of the initial isolated outbreak, so there\nwas no pandemic (Morrison, Liston, & Abbott,\n1976; Bernstein, 1981). In 2002, the\nUS administration announced a smallpox vaccination plan to protect Americans because\nof the threat of a terrorist attack. It expected to administer 450,000 doses of\nvaccine to health workers who would be thus prepared to care for patients infected\nwith the virus. However, the plan ran into opposition. Its acceptance further dropped\nafter reports of unexpected heart problems possibly associated with the vaccine, and\nafter the threat of terrorists\u2019 attacks did not materialize. At the end of the year,\nthe program succeeded in vaccinating only about 10% of the target population and it\ncame to an end (Manning, 2003; Matthews, Murphy, Lopez, & Orenstein, 2003).\nAn argument can be made that the harm and burden of these vaccination programs, which\nin retrospect were unnecessary, were reduced because the programs were voluntary. If\nthese programs would have been implemented as mandatory measures, the burden would\nhave been more severe and the moral culpability of the experts and decision-makers\nwould be much greater. Hence, mass vaccination programs should remain voluntary.",

The autonomy of an individual is expressed foremost by a\nperson's free decision to be a member of a particular community and by freedom\nto leave it. But as long as a person remains a member of a community, the social\ncontract binds him to accept obligations requested by society together with\nbenefits provided by that society (EURO ELSAV,\n2002).(c)Health care professionals, indeed, are a special category of the population,\nwith manifestly different rights and obligations than other workers in personal\nservices. Therefore, they can be treated differently than other groups, and this\nincludes having vaccination imposed on them, without committing an\ninjustice.(d)The principle of the least infringement does not apply because mandatory and\nvoluntary vaccination programs are not equally efficient at achieving the goal\nof vaccination. At least, there is no proof that a voluntary vaccination\nprogram, even if could be made more acceptable, would ever come close to\nrecruiting 100% of health care workers.

Similarly, it has to be noted that the national influenza pandemic\nplans of Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom do not provide (or refer a\nreader to) the kind of empirical data that would make it possible to assess the\nethical acceptability of some of the measures that are proposed by these plans,\nvaccination being one of them. Particularly, these plans do not provide any estimates\nof staff shortages likely to be caused by influenza, of the benefits of vaccination in\nthe reduction of absenteeism, of the benefits of diminishing an infection transfer\nfrom staff to patients, of the burdens and risks of vaccination and so on. Yet, any\nproposed public health intervention needs to have a significant probability of\nbenefits and a strong likelihood of a positive risk/benefit ratio in order to be\nethically acceptable. This will be true for measures that will be offered to the\npopulation for voluntary participation; for compulsory measures, the standard has to\nbe even higher.",

In such a situation, each of us\nis likely to make a personal choice based on our deepest values. Those who favor an\nindividualistic interpretation of autonomy and strongly believe in the dominant role of\nself-determination as a moral foundation of a free society will likely oppose mandatory\nmeasures. My personal preference is a society \u201cwhich not only promotes individual rights\nbut accepts collective responsibility to live a collaborative life which promotes\nautonomy\u201d (Doucet & Melchin, 1995), and if\nnecessary, I am prepared to prescribe the collaboration in communal interest (Tauber, 2002). Hence, I suggest that on balance,\nthe arguments presented in favor of mandatory vaccination are more convincing than those\nagainst the mandatory approach, providing certain assumptions about pandemic and\nvaccination are indeed correct. Of all the objections against this position, I believe\nthe weightiest one is the assertion that if a voluntary vaccination program for health\ncare workers were fully implemented, it would be just as effective as a mandatory\nprogram, without the drawbacks of compulsion and enforcement.",
