Subsequently, 186 cases were confirmed, with 38 deaths. In addition, 16,752 suspected cases had a substantial impact on the education, tourism, political and economic sectors.4 Domestic and international media sources attributed the spread of MERS in South Korea to many factors. Reuters reported that South Korea's MERS situation would not be abated without information transparency and cooperation with international virus hunters, pointing out the South Korean Government's refusal to seek help from international parties as particularly troubling.5 Science highlighted problems such as inadequate in-hospital ventilation, extensive transmission caused by unmanaged super spreaders, poor infection control measures, and refusal to disclose the names of hospitals where confirmed cases of MERS had been treated or sought treatment.6 The Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that problems with the initial response in South Korea could be attributed to inconsistent definition and isolation of close contacts, subsequent failure to conduct pre-emptive quarantines, and the Government's failure to implement appropriate crisis communication measures.7\n",

In contrast, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the global MERS fatality rate between March 2012 and October 2015 was 38.6% (1616 confirmed cases and 624 deaths). There were marked regional differences in mortality rates: 41.1% in the Middle East, 53.3% in Europe and 40.0% in Africa, compared with 19.2% in Asian countries.3 Among probable SARS cases that occurred during 2002 and 2003, the global case fatality rate was lower at 9.6% (774 deaths in 8098 cases), but again there was considerable regional variation.18 One of the reasons why South Korea has a lower fatality rate than other MERS-outbreak countries may be accessibility to a high level of emergency medical treatment. The difference does not appear to be attributable to mutations in the virus.19 There was also a difference in the types of underlying conditions associated with fatal MERS in South Korea compared with Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, diabetes mellitus (74% of patients) was the most common underlying condition in fatal cases, followed by end-stage renal disease (52%), lung disease (43%) and cardiac disease (39%).20 However, in South Korea, respiratory disease (30.5%), cancer (27.8%) and hypertension (22.2%) were the most common underlying conditions.",

The MERS infection routes in South Korea are characterized by both intra- and interhospital transmission.9 Cases of community-acquired transmission were not found, corroborating the findings of the WHO report that there was no evidence of transmission outside hospitals in South Korea.16, 21, 22 However, it was noted that MERS testing was only available to patients known to have been in close contact with a confirmed or suspected case; as such, more casual contacts of MERS cases may have been missed because they were not tested. However, global experience does indicate that MERS is predominantly a nosocomially acquired infection,18 so restrictions on visitors are likely to play a key role in controlling MERS.23\n",

It was reported that South Korea's MERS outbreak was caused by poor hospital infection control standards and lack of monitoring close contacts, which was also the case in Saudi Arabia.19 It was highlighted that public risk communication was delayed because the South Korean Government prioritized the determination of all details of the outbreak rather than information disclosure. This resulted in widespread panic during the MERS crisis.24 Jack pointed out that while the biological basis for the initial failure to contain MERS is unclear, a number of factors contributed significantly, including \u2018doctor shopping\u2019 behaviour (i.e. a patient seeks treatment from various hospitals for the same ailment), lack of epidemiology experts, the culture of frequent hospital visits and familial care-giving, and the South Korean Government's steadfast stance on keeping information contained.25 WHO experts indicated that problems with the initial spread of MERS in South Korea included prevalent occurrences among medical staff, lack of hospital infection management procedures, extremely crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed rooms in some hospitals, \u2018doctor shopping\u2019 behaviour, and the spread of infection through patient's family members or friends during hospital visits.26 Finally, Choi et al. reported that South Korea's initial failure to control MERS was caused by South Korea's rigid application of MERS control guidelines which failed to isolate all close contacts, failure to recognize super-spreading events, environmental factors such as inadequate ventilation, insufficient infectious disease management capacity in secondary hospitals, and the South Korean Government's inadequate crisis management communication.4\n",
