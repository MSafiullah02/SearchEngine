            "text": "In conclusion, we have measured the filtration efficiencies of various commonly available\nfabrics for use as cloth masks in filtering particles in the significant (for aerosol-based\nvirus transmission) size range of \u223c10 nm to \u223c6 \u03bcm and have presented\nfiltration efficiency data as a function of aerosol particle size. We find that cotton,\nnatural silk, and chiffon can provide good protection, typically above 50% in the\nentire 10 nm to 6.0 \u03bcm range, provided they have a tight weave. Higher threads per\ninch cotton with tighter weaves resulted in better filtration efficiencies. For instance, a\n600 TPI cotton sheet can provide average filtration efficiencies of 79 \u00b1 23% (in the 10\nnm to 300 nm range) and 98.4 \u00b1 0.2% (in the 300 nm to 6 \u03bcm range). A cotton quilt\nwith batting provides 96 \u00b1 2% (10 nm to 300 nm) and 96.1 \u00b1 0.3% (300 nm to 6\n\u03bcm). Likely the highly tangled fibrous nature of the batting aids in the superior\nperformance at small particle sizes. Materials such as silk and chiffon are particularly\neffective (considering their sheerness) at excluding particles in the nanoscale regime\n(<\u223c100 nm), likely due to electrostatic effects that result in charge transfer\nwith nanoscale aerosol particles. A four-layer silk (used, for instance, as a scarf) was\nsurprisingly effective with an average efficiency of >85% across the 10 nm \u22126\n\u03bcm particle size range. As a result, we found that hybrid combinations of cloths such\nas high threads-per-inch cotton along with silk, chiffon, or flannel can provide broad\nfiltration coverage across both the nanoscale (<300 nm) and micron scale (300 nm to 6\n\u03bcm) range, likely due to the combined effects of electrostatic and physical filtering.\nFinally, it is important to note that openings and gaps (such as those between the mask\nedge and the facial contours) can degrade the performance. Our findings indicate that\nleakages around the mask area can degrade efficiencies by \u223c50% or more, pointing out\nthe importance of \u201cfit\u201d. Opportunities for future\nstudies include cloth mask design for better \u201cfit\u201d and the role of\nfactors such as humidity (arising from exhalation) and the role of repeated use and washing\nof cloth masks. In summary, we find that the use of cloth masks can potentially provide\nsignificant protection against the transmission of particles in the aerosol size range.",
