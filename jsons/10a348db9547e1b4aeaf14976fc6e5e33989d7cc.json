Current antiviral treatments target viral proteins and may be compromised due to the emergence of drug resistant viral strains. Targeting viral-host interactions is now gaining recognition as an alternative approach against viral infections. Recent research has revealed that heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1, an RNA-binding protein, plays an essential functional and regulatory role in the life cycle of many viruses. In this review, we summarize the interactions between heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and multiple viral proteins during the life cycle of RNA and DNA viruses. hnRNPA1 protein levels are modulated differently, in different viruses, which further dictates its stability, function, and intracellular localization. Multiple reports have emphasized that in Sindbis virus, enteroviruses, porcine endemic diarrhea virus, and rhinovirus infection, hnRNPA1 enhances viral replication and survival. However, in others like hepatitis C virus and human T-cell lymphotropic virus, it exerts a protective response. The involvement of hnRNPA1 in viral infections highlights its importance as a central regulator of host and viral gene expression. Understanding the nature of these interactions will increase our understanding of specific viral infections and pathogenesis and eventually aid in the development of novel and robust antiviral intervention strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Recent technical advances in methodology, including genomewide RNA interference (RNAi) screens, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens, and transcriptional gene expression profiling, have identified hundreds of host proteins involved in viral infections, of which about one in five are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).

After being transcribed, cellular pre-mRNAs associate with nuclear proteins to form heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes, which function to affect the structure, posttranscriptional processing, or nucleocytoplasmic transport of these mRNAs. 16, 17 They also regulate splicing, nuclear export of mRNAs, telomere biogenesis, DNA repair, transcription, translation, and cell signalling. [17] [18] [19] The hnRNP family comprises of more than 20 evolutionarily conserved proteins, named alphabetically from hnRNPA1-hnRNPU in humans. 17 All the members of the family share a common modular structure consisting of one or more RNA-binding domains (RBDs) which dictate their interaction with RNA. 17 hnRNPA1 is the most abundant RBP in the hnRNP(A/B) subfamily. It affects the expression of many critical genes in the host, at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational, and posttranslational level which are responsible for controlling crucial metabolic pathways in the host. [19] [20] [21] [22] The N-terminal domain of the protein encodes two RBDs which are pivotal for RNA specificity and binding ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, a flexible glycine-rich arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) region known as the RGG box imparts protein and RNA binding features to the protein. Downstream of the RGG box, there is a 38 amino acid (aa) sequence termed the M9 nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) in the glycine (Glyc) rich region, which facilitates bidirectional nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the protein by means of its interaction with the members of importin \u03b1/\u03b2 sub-family 17, [23] [24] [25] ( Figure 1 ). Transportin-1 interacts with the Glyc-rich region (195-268 aa) of hnRNPA1 by the virtue of its F-peptide (301-318 aa). 25 Post-translation modifications (PTMs) in a protein are known to affect their activity and binding affinity. Likewise, several posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation dictate the activity and compartmentalization of hnRNPA1 in a cell. 17 For instance, methylation of arginine residues in the RGG motif may regulate the RNA-binding activity of the protein. 21, [26] [27] [28] Similarly, kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) phosphorylate serine residues present at both the N and C terminal of the protein, regulating its function. 17, 21, [29] [30] [31] PTMs like phosphorylation in the C-terminal region of the protein result in cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNPA1. 22, 25, 30 Contrastingly, the addition of O-GlcNAcylation (GlcNAc) moiety to the serine or threonine aa via \u03b2-O-linkage is a commonly occurring, reversible modification which impairs the binding of hnRNPA1 to karyopherin \u03b2 (Transportin-1). 25, 32 This leads to enhanced nuclear localization of the protein, eventually affecting its activity. 25 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 387, "end": 390, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 530, "end": 534, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1133, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1138, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1143, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1148, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1723, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1728, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1733, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1738, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2292, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2293, "end": 2297, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2298, "end": 2302, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2307, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2542, "end": 2545, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2549, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2554, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2555, "end": 2559, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2560, "end": 2564, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2678, "end": 2681, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2685, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2918, "end": 2921, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1255, "end": 1263, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1749, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Based on the polarity of the genome, viruses are categorized as positive sense or negative sense.

In human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) cell culture model, hnRNPA1 inhibits the binding of the Rex protein to its response element (RxRE or XRE) in 3 0 long terminal repeat (LTR) of all viral RNAs. Silencing RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of hnRNPA1 affected the splicing of gag/pol transcripts and increased the binding of Rex to its response element, thereby positively affecting the rate of viral replication. 36 Furthermore, ectopic expression of hnRNPA1 antagonized the posttranscriptional activity of Rex by competitive binding, thereby eliciting an antiviral response against HTLV-1 infection. 59 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a 13.6-kb genome which encodes a single positive sense RNA molecule 9.6 kb in size encoding a polycistronic open reading frame (ORF) flanked by UTR regions at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends. 60-63 These regions are pivotal for viral replication. The conserved region at the 3 0 end of the ORF is termed the cis-acting replication element (CRE), which is indispensable for viral replication and translation. The conserved structure is responsible for RNA-RNA interactions with various viral and host factors, one of which is hnRNPA1. 26,29,64-68 Additionally, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) also interacts with hnRNPA1. 58,65 Up-regulation of hnRNPA1 in Huh-7 cells, down-regulated HCV RNA synthesis, and 48 hours post-infection coinciding with a surge in HCV RNA synthesis", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "hnRNPA1 was redistributed to the cytoplasmic site of viral replication and bound to the 5 0 UTR region (5 0 UTR) of viral RNA, promoting the synthesis of negative-strand RNA (G and SG RNA).

This phenomenon was linked with decrease in the nuclear pore glycoprotein p62 and transportin-1 levels, post-infection, pivotal for nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of hnRNP proteins.43 Cytoplasmic retention of hnRNPA1 favored IRES-mediated translation of viral genes and vice-versa. In contrast, Zahler et al highlighted the importance of hnRNPA1 in regulating the splicing of many viral genes (viz, Tat), wherein, hnRNPA1 binds to exonic splicing silencer 2 (ESS 2), thereby repressing the splicing of Tat mRNA. 44,45 Overexpression of hnRNPA1 in an in vitro system abrogated the expression of TaT, adversely affecting viral replication. 43,45,46,78-80 hnRNPA1 is known for its action as a cis-acting element favoring replication and transcription of viral genes. Luo et al reported that the C terminal region of hnRNPA1 has high affinity and directly binds to the SARS_N (Nucleopcapsid protein) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (SARS CoV). 81 However, a deletion in the C-terminal region of the protein substantially abrogated viral replication and transcription, suggesting that hnRNPA1 and SARS_N interaction facilitates the binding of other cis-or trans-activating factors, enabling viral transcription and replication to ensue. 81 Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the genus Betacoronaviruses. hnRNPA1 is up-regulated and localized to the cytoplasm, post-MHV infection. 81 It regulates discontinuous viral transcription by binding to negative strand leader and IG sequence indispensable for viral transcription and also mediates the formation of MHV viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. 82,83 Furthermore, it also binds to MHV N protein which has multifarious roles in the viral life-cycle and has the ability to bind viral RNA. 16,84-86 Remarkably, hnRNPA1 also binds to positive stranded 3 0 UTR, suggesting a possible role in negative strand RNA synthesis. 84 There are conflicting reports about the importance of hnRNPA1 in MHV infection. According to a study by Shi et al, viral RNA synthesis was enhanced after ectopic expression of hnRNPA1; however, a truncation mutant of the protein, lacking the C terminal region responsible for cytoplasmic localization of the protein, had inverse effects. 83,87 Another report by Shen et al claimed that CB3 cell lines lacking any detectable expression of the RBP could sustain viral replication, implying that the effect exerted by hnRNPA1 can be substituted by other cellular gene products similar in function to hnRNPA1 in un-infected and virally infected CB3 cells. 49,88 Many members of the hnRNP family interact in a similar fashion with MHV RNA viz a viz, hnRNP(A/B), hnRNPA2/B1, and hnRNPA3, further supporting the effect observed in hnRNPA1-silenced cell line. 50 Maeto et al ascribed that hnRNP A/B subfamily (hnRNP A1 and A2) has a different role in acute and persistent Junin virus (JUNV)infections.51 JUNV is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family.57,89 Acute infection by this virus is characterized by enhanced production of viral progeny, whereas, in the role of this protein in the host whereby cytoplasmic hnRNPA1 negatively regulates the translation of anti-apoptotic proteins like XIAP and APAF1.92,93 Furthermore, down-regulation of hnRNP(A/B) proteins individually abrogates JUNV replication; however, the effect was much more pronounced when both hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 were silenced simultaneously.51 Moreover, hnRNPA1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with N protein in acutely infected cells.51 Upregulating N protein induced cytoplasmic re-localization of hnRNPA1 in Vero cells,51 further pointing towards the role of hnRNPA1 in the JUNV lifecycle.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "using RBPMap identified the binding of hnRNPA1 to stabilize a noncoding internal repeat region 1 (IR1) of EBV RNA.52,94 Additional molecular and biochemical studies aiming towards characterizing the role of this protein in EBV are needed to better understand the importance of hnRNPA1 in the EBV lifecycle. Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) is the most common sexually transmitted virus. It encodes early and late genes under the control of different promoters. Viral gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. 95 hnRNPA1 expression is upregulated in HPV-16 infection. 96 hnRNPA1 has also been observed to directly bind to splicing silencer RNA elements in HPV-16L1 coding region, thereby inhibiting splicing of HPV-16 late mRNA. 97-99 Additionally, hnRNPA1 promoted splicing of early HPV mRNAs, thereby promoting enhanced gene expression. 95,100 However, further studies directing towards modulating the levels of hnRNPA1 are needed to elucidate its role in HPV-16 replication. In the case of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Lyses et al reported that although hnRNPA1 silencing did not have any major effect on viral replication and growth, HeLa cells in which hnRNPA1 was silenced displayed delayed onset of apoptosis post-virus infection,suggesting that hnRNPA1 may play a protective role by initiating antiviral immune response post-VSV infection.54", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Chiu et al reported that in avian reovirus (ARV) infection, nonstructural protein p17 is shuttled to and fro from the nucleus in an hnRNPA1-dependent manner. 42 hnRNPA1 is constantly shuttled to and fro the nucleus by an active import/export mechanism which relies on its interaction with the F-peptide (301-318 aa) of T A B L E 3 Summary of reports with contradicting roles for hnRNPA1 Summary of reports in which the role of hnRNPA1 is not elucidated", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Successful infection is characterized by sequestering host proteins, concurrently, evading the host-induced immune response.1 Owing to their limited genetic capacity, viruses tend to utilize many host proteins. Likewise, hosts have evolved innate and adaptive cellu-lar defense mechanisms to counteract the infection caused by these viruses. The multifaceted nature of hnRNPA1 in the host makes it a lucrative target for many viruses. This review highlights the importance of hnRNPA1 and diverse roles played by this protein in the life cycle of various viruses. For instance, in Sindbis virus, 18,37,69 PEDV, 38 EV-71, 39 and HRV 40,41 infections, hnRNPA1 shows a pro-viral effect which may be attributed to the role of this protein as an ITAF, positively regulating IRES mediated translation of viral RNAs. Likewise, in ARV infection, virus exploits the nucleo-cytoplasmic machinery in place for trafficking hnRNPA1 via its interaction with transportin-1 to indirectly translocate p17 42,76 through the NPC. hnRNPA1 down-regulation, affects virus titer, negatively, implicating towards a supportive role in ARV infection. 42 Contrastingly, in HTLV-1 36,59 and HCV-1 55,58,61,63 life cycle, hnRNPA1 negatively regulates viral replication by controlling the posttranscriptional and translational modification of viral mRNAs. However, in the case of HIV-1, 43-46 SARS CoV, 47,48 MHV, 49,50 and JUNV 51,89-91 infections, the advantage gained by the virus through its interaction with hnRNPA1 is debatable. This can be linked to the way the host interactome is shaped post-viral infection. For example, depending on the stage of infection, that is, acute or chronic, the localization of hnRNPA1 is modulated and varied effects are exhibitedin JUNV cell culture model.51", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
