The best defense against the virus is vaccination, which unfortunately is limited by difficulties in the selection of appropriate antigens from the circulating strains of the virus. Additionally, the level of immunity in the population is limited if the vaccine coverage is less than 100%. Due to these reasons, influenza virus can easily spread in the human population.",

Currently, there are two drugs approved: oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche) and zanamivir (Relenza, GlaxoSmithKline).

One mechanism involves reduction of binding efficiency of viral hemagglutinin to its receptor. Another is associated with substitution of amino acids around the active site of NA [5] . The first cases of oseltamivirresistant strains of influenza A/H1N1 were reported in 2008 in Europe [6] . Analysis of the drug-resistant strains revealed that all the viruses carried the same C->T transition mutation in the neuraminidase gene in position 823. This results in a histidine-tyrosine change at amino acid position 275 (H275Y or H274Y, according to the universal N2 numbering) [7] .",

Using conserved fragments of M gene and a variable fragment of NA makes this method very universal for all serotypes of influenza virus. The sensitivity of the assay was several hundred copies of virus for both general detection and differentiation of oseltamivir resistant and sensitive strains. These results are somewhat worse compared to those of a previous study but still good enough to be useful for diagnostics. In our opinion, the test may serve as the first step of influenza diagnostics for making decisions about further treatment of patients.",
