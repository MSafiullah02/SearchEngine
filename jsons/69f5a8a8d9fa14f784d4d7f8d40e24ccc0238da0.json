As ART specialists we should be cautious, carefully monitoring the situation whilst contributing by sharing novel evidence to counsel our patients, both pregnant women and would-be mothers. Time to egg collection and drop-out rates are parameters critical to scheduling treatments once the curve of infections has peaked and plateaued in each country. In order to reduce both parameters, infertile patients now require even more support from their IVF team: urgent oocyte collection for oncologic patients must be guaranteed, and oocyte retrievals for women of advanced maternal age and/or reduced ovarian reserve cannot be postponed indefinitely. This document represents the position of the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine (SIFES-MR) in outlining ART priorities during and after this emergency.",

At the beginning of January 2020, China announced a new major epidemic foci of coronavirus disease 2019 , now rapidly expanding worldwide. Despite contrasting theories regarding the origin of this virus, its natural development was recently demonstrated (Andersen et al., 2020) . On March 11 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease COVID-19 a pandemic (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audioemergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-and-final-11mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=cb432bb3_2). In this regard, many countries are using a combination of containment and mitigation activities with the intention of delaying major peaks of patients to manage the limited number of hospital beds/facilities demands (Bedford et al., 2020) . Following China, Italy was the country which had the highest number of cases (on March 30, 2020: 101739 cases, 3981 currently in ICUs and 11591 deaths). During the first 10 days of March 2020, data from Italy has shown that 9-11% of actively infected patients with COVID-19 required intensive care (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020) . Lisa Rosenbaum recently stated in the New England Journal of Medicine: \"Though the Italian health system is highly regarded [\u2026], it has been impossible to meet the needs of so many critically-ill patients simultaneously. Elective surgeries have been cancelled, semi-elective procedures postponed, and operating rooms turned into makeshift ICUs. With all beds occupied, corridors and administrative areas are lined with patients, some of them receiving noninvasive ventilation\" (Rosenbaum, 2020) . The author further elegantly stated \"the tragedy in Italy reinforces the wisdom of many public health experts: the best outcome of this pandemic would be being accused of having over prepared\" and we, as the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine (SIFES-MR), undoubtedly share her stance and drafted this report for ART specialists worldwide.",

To date, Fan et al hypothesized no vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which was not reported in all screened products of conception and newborns (two whose mothers were infected) (Fan et al., 2020) . Evidence confirmed this also in 9 late pregnancies described in the Lancet by Chen et al (Chen et al., 2020) . Clearly, infected (or suspected to be infected) mothers must avoid close contact with the newborns, especially avoiding breastfeeding, as highlighted by Qiao in its comment to Chen's report (Qiao, 2020) . In general, all these evidences must be confirmed in larger studies, especially since equally-underpowered and possibly-biased reports of adverse gestational/neonatal outcomes have been also reported (Liu et al., 2020b , Liu et al., 2020a .",

The aim of all these national and international documents is to safeguard the health of ART operators, of the couples undergoing ART and of the newborns, who must all deal with this COVID-19 emergency. These precautionary measures are based on the principles of responsibility and solidarity and are aimed at preventing the contagion, the overload of the healthcare system, as well as the establishment of a pregnancy in this situation.Infertility in Italy: a constant decreasing trend in the number of live births and the key role of ARTThe Italian population (60.7 millions) decreases 0.2% every year with a life expectancy of 82.5 years. It is amongst the oldest population in the world and is facing difficulties in financing pensions due to a lack of younger tax-payers. We have 1.35 births per woman versus 1.96 in France and 1.8 in the USA. In Italy, as well as in the majority of other countries, infertility occurs in approximately 20% of the population with many women undergoing ART at >37 years old and 35.2% of total candidates being older than 40. There are more than 300 IVF centers which overall performed 71686 cycles in 2017 and resulted in 2.5% of the live births of the whole Country (2.9% of which through gamete donation programs)",

In this regard, infertility is \"a disease\" according to the ICMART-WHO glossary of infertility(Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2009b, Zegers- Hochschild et al., 2009a upon which the impact of the \"time\" variable is critical, especially in populations of AMA and reduced ovarian reserve women, whose chances sharply decrease over time. Further postponing ovarian stimulation and the time to oocyte retrieval to an indefinite period of time in these women will certainly affect their chance to achieve a live birth. Therefore, SIFES-MR suggests scheduling oocyte/embryo cryopreservation in these patients first, soon after the peak of COVID-19 infections will be finally overcome in each Country, while always guaranteeing oocyte retrievals for oncologic patients.During this pandemic, some important aspects become essential: (i) the careful identification of the infertile women falling in these time-sensitive categories; (ii) the efficient personalization of the stimulation based on maternal age and ovarian reserve; (iii) and the prevention of the ART-related risks (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, OHSS; complications associated with the oocyte retrieval; multiple gestations).It is implicit that only ART clinics with high expertise in the management of potentially-infectious specimens, equipped to cope with putative complications, competent in the vitrification and warming procedures, and following the recommendations of scientific societies of embryologists like the Italian //www.sierr.it/comunicazioni-news-embriologia-ricerca/emergenza-covid-19raccomandazioni-sierr-per-il-laboratorio-di-pma.html; translated in English and currently in press in Human Reproduction) should be allowed to perform oocyte retrievals in this emergency. Given these prerequisites, all ART clinics are also tissue centers inherently characterized by a protected setting and environment which constantly safeguards both patients and operators.",
