This definition was difficult to apply in children with ALF as the disease process could start in utero and time quantification might not be possible and, also, encephalopa-thy might be difficult to diagnose. Trying to address this issue, Bhaduri and Vergani defined ALF in children as \"a rare multisystem disorder in which severe impairment of liver function, with or without encephalopathy, occurs in association with hepatocellular necrosis in a patient with no recognized underlying chronic liver disease\" [2] . This newer definition for children failed to differentiate between acute hepatitis and ALF as \"severe impairment of liver function\" is very subjective and can vary from person to person.",

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can be a dose-dependent response, an idiosyncratic reaction or a synergistic reaction when two medications are given together. It is essential to enquire about any indigenous/herbal medicine intake as some are potentially hepatotoxic [7] . Acetaminophen is the most common drug associated with ALF and is normally a dose-dependent hepatotoxic agent. Acetaminophen is detoxified mainly by glucuronidation (40%), sulphation (20-40%) and N-hydroxylation (15%). A small fraction is metabolized via cytochrome P450 to yield N-acetyl-para-benzoquinoneimide (NAPQI), a toxic intermediate compound which irreversibly conjugates with the sulphhydryl group of glutathione and causes hepatocyte necrosis [8] . NAPQI forms acetaminophen-protein adducts, which acts as a specific biomarker for chronic acetaminophen-related toxicity. In acute acetaminophen poisoning, serum levels after 4 h of ingestion are useful in identifying high-risk patients. Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes could predispose affected people to acetaminophen toxicity. Anti-tuberculosis drugs, particularly isoniazid, are associated with drug-induced ALF. The mechanism of toxicity is similar to acetaminophen; oxidation via cytochrome P450 pathway results in toxic metabolites.",

Around 8% of idiosyncratic DILI developed ALF [10] . DILI is unpredictable, but genetic susceptibility of an individual to certain drugs and underlying mitochondrial cytopathies are proposed causes [11] . The Councils for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/ Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (CIOMS/ RUCAM) scale is helpful in establishing causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. Using the scoring system, suspected drug could be categorized into \"definite or highly probable\" (score > 8), \"probable\" (score 6-8), \"possible\" (score 3-5), \"unlikely\" (score 1-2) and \"excluded\" (score \u2264 0) [12] . This scale is helpful in identifying druginduced hepatotoxicity even in newly marketed drugs and for a previously unreported older drug.

This hypothesis is supported by successful prevention of severe disease by antenatal and postnatal treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.

Galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia type I and fructosaemia are few of the metabolic disorders that could present as ALF. Tyrosinaemia type I is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism, due to absence of enzyme fumarylacetoacetase, the last enzyme in a series of five enzymes needed to break down tyrosine. This results in formation of intermediate compounds, maleylacetoacetic acid and fumarylacetoacetic acid, which is converted to succinylacetone, a toxin that damages the liver and kidneys. Oral NTBC (nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione) and phenylalanine-and tyrosine-free diet could help liver recovery, but some children might require LT. Galactosaemia type 1 is autosomal recessive disorder with mutation in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene located on chro-mosome 9p13. Lactose-free diet should be started in any infant presenting with ALF or hepatitis until the quantitative GALT activity is available. Galactose-free diet and supportive treatment may allow recovery of ALF. Rarely inborn errors of bile acid synthesis can present as ALF.",

Prognostic scoring helps in predicting mortality and helps in listing appropriate patients for transplantation. For non-acetaminophen ALF, several prognostic scoring systems are available for adults, but in children there are no universally accepted criteria for listing. To date, INR and factor V concentration remain the best indicators of mortality without transplantation in paediatric ALF. Bhaduri and Mieli-Vergani showed that the maximum INR reached during the course of illness was the most sensitive predictor of the outcome, with 73% of children with an INR less than 4 surviving compared with only 4 of 24 (16.6%) with an INR greater than 4 [2] .

TPE has been increasingly used over the past decade as a first-line and lifesaving treatment for various conditions classified by the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA). In acute fulminant Wilson's disease, it can rapidly remove significant amount of copper and, thereby, reduce haemolysis, prevent progression to renal failure and provide clinical stabilization. It has been reported to be used as a bridge to LT or can lead to elimination of the need for urgent LT. TPE is also helpful in stabilizing ALF due to viral hepatitis, drug-induced hepatitis, etc. by removing albumin-bound toxins, large molecular weight toxins, aromatic amino acids, ammonia, endotoxin, indols, mercaptans, phenols, etc.",

Successful use of these devices in children with ALF as a bridge therapy, supporting liver function while the native liver regenerates, is not recommended outside research setting.",

            "text": "Liver transplant remains the only proven treatment that has improved the outcome of ALF. Appropriate patient selection and timing of transplantation are essential for graft and patient survival. Several surgical techniques such split liver grafts, reduced grafts and auxiliary liver transplants are practiced, depending upon patient size, organ availability and surgical expertise available. Auxiliary liver transplant is a surgical technique where the donor liver is placed alongside of native liver and the allograft supports the entire liver function, while the native liver regenerates. Either left lateral segment or right lobe allograft could be used, based on recipient weight. Once native liver regeneration is optimal [36] , then immunosuppression could be weaned and eventually stopped. In a series from King's College Hospital, of the 20 children who received auxiliary liver transplantation for ALF, immunosuppression was withdrawn successfully in 11 patients at a median time of 23 months after transplantation [37] . This would be an ideal option in ALF due to indeterminate aetiology, as spontaneous regeneration of native liver remains a possibility. Liver transplantation is indicated in ALF due to liverbased disorders while contraindicated in haematological malignancies, uncontrolled sepsis, systemic mitochondrial/ metabolic disorders and severe respiratory failure (ARDS) [38] . Relative contraindications are increasing inotropic requirements, infection under treatment, cerebral perfusion pressure of less than 40 mmHg for more than 2 h and a history of progressive or severe neurologic problems.",
