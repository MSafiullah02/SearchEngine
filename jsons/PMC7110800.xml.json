Non-native species often increase their populations rapidly in a novel ranges where they may be free of the factors, such as disease and predators, that limit populations in their native range. Alternatively, they may be exposed to new pathogens that have the potential to prevent or reduce the rate of establishment (Hilker et al., 2005). This may particularly be the case when small founder populations with reduced genetic diversity render newly established populations particularly vulnerable to novel infections (Hawley et al., 2006).",

Introduced mammals are the single gravest threat to biodiversity in New Zealand (King, 1984). Predators, such as stoats Mustela erminea, are a particularly serious problem since many of New Zealand\u2019s endemic birds have evolved in the absence of predators (King, 1984) and there has been considerable public expenditure on large-scale culling of stoats with the aim of reducing stoat predation (McDonald and Murphy, 2000). Given that conventional methods of stoat control are limited to trapping and poisoning which are expensive, there are moves towards identifying more cost-effective methods of long term and widespread control of stoat predation. These include conventional biological control using lethal or sub-lethal pathogens and immunocontraception, potentially using a disseminating vector that would be genetically modified from a widespread, host-specific infectious agent (Norbury, 2000, McDonald and Larivi\u00e8re, 2001). This clearly requires knowledge and comparison of the diseases stoats encounter in their native and non-native range.",

Studies of the general biology of stoats in New Zealand have provided basic data on the prevalence of certain parasites, such as the nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, the adults of which infects the sinuses of various mustelids, and of ectoparasites (King and Moody, 1982). A histopathological survey of naturally occurring disease among stoats living in Britain concluded that stoat populations in their native range were remarkably healthy, since 61% of stoats exhibited no significant pathological lesions at the microscopic level (McDonald et al., 2001). Among British samples, nematode parasitism was identified in the intestines of 14% of 44 stoats and in the lungs of 11%. Pulmonary granulomatous inflammation or microgranulomas were identified in 11% and blood-filled, peliosis-like cavities in the livers of two individuals.",

In common with the British samples, no lesions of the brain were observed that would have been consistent with infection by distemper virus, though this can not be taken as evidence of the absence of this disease and three individuals in this study were seropositive for morbillivirus, which is comparable to a recent finding of two seropositive animals from a sample of 32 stoats sampled in Canterbury, New Zealand (T. Zheng, personal communication). Two cases of blood-filled cavities in the liver were observed in stoats, similar to the peliosis-like lesions observed in two British stoats. At the time, we suggested that the British samples may have been secondarily exposed to rodenticides and this remains a possibility for the New Zealand specimens (McDonald et al., 1998, Murphy et al., 1998).",

These feline viruses are generally very host-specific and so these findings are strongly indicative of infection with a mustelid calicivirus. It is not possible at this stage completely to rule out cross-reaction with rabbit caliciviruses that include RHD, which have previously been recorded in stoats in New Zealand (Henning, 2003). However RHD is caused by a separate genus of caliciviruses Lagovirus whereas cat caliciviruses are Vesivirus. Cross-reaction across genera and such a broad host range is unlikely. Caliciviruses can cause a range of pathologies in their hosts ranging from upper respiratory tract infections in cats to gastroenteritis in humans. Four of the stoats found to be seropositive to calicivirus exhibited histopathological signs of inflammatory lung disease. However, the prevalence of these signs of disease was particularly high across all stoats examined and so it was not possible to demonstrate an association between disease and infection by calicivirus.",

Mink caliciviruses (MCV) have been isolated from mink on ranches with a history of haemorrhagic pneumonia (Evermann et al., 1983). However, mink enteric caliciviruses have been shown to be genetically distinct from non-enteric calicivirus (Guo et al., 2001). This is clearly, therefore, a diverse group and while it is novel that calicivirus has been detected in stoats, it is not surprising. This screening study is a first step towards evaluating the incidence and effects of calicivirus in wild stoats. However, the finding holds promise in terms of identifying potentially widespread viral infections that may have a role as biological control agents or as vectors thereof.",

In particular, we detected a significantly higher prevalence (63%) of pneumonia of varying degrees of severity, while pulmonary inflammatory disease was detected in only 5/44 (11%) British stoats (\u03c7c2=26.17,P<0.001). While this is a screening study, it is tempting to speculate on the implications of these findings. The widespread incidence of pneumonia suggests that stoats are subject to a higher rate of infection of some agent, which may be more prevalent in New Zealand or notably less prevalent in Great Britain. Alternatively, the pulmonary immune system of stoats in New Zealand may be compromised in some way. The cause of the high incidence of pneumonia could not be detected by histopathological techniques and our serological investigation could not reveal the association of exposure to any of the tested virus groups with these signs of disease. In the development of a biological control agent or candidate vector for an immunocontraceptive, the identification of the organism causing the inflammation observed here is an obvious first step. Thereafter, a search for an organism, or strain of the same infecting organism, that invades hosts through the lungs would be especially useful.",

Similarly, rates of arthropod-borne infections such as those caused by Bartonella spp. among New Zealand stoats are markedly lower than occur in Britain (McDonald et al., 2000, McDonald et al., 2004), suggesting differences among pathogens in the rate at which diseases and/or their arthropod vectors were transported between native and non-native ranges. Examination of tissues from other invasive predators collected contemporaneously in New Zealand has provided an interesting comparison to samples from the stoats. Two of three weasels, a ferret and one of three feral cats examined exhibited interstitial pneumonia and granulomatous inflammation similar to that observed in the stoats (McDonald et al., 2004). Clearly, a similar range of lesions were present in these other species. This confirms the importance of investigating host specificity in the development of any putative biocontrol agent.",
