The time of the sessions is 1 hour, and all variables are reported as mean 1-minute values at 5 time increments (1, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes [Table 1, Table 2\n]). One-hour averages were used for the statistical analysis because no significant changes over time were observed at the individual time increments. To assess differences between the EAPR and controls at the 2 intensity levels during 1 hour of exercise, a 1-way (4 conditions) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. To determine differences for physiological variables, repeated-measures ANOVAs for oxygen saturation, partial pressure of transcutaneous carbon dioxide, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute volume, and heart rate were performed. Significant differences were further analyzed utilizing pair-wise comparisons tests with least significant differences adjustments with the \u03b1 level set at P = .05. Paired t tests were performed to examine respirator dead space oxygen and carbon dioxide responses to EAPR at the 2 exercise intensities. Exertion scores, comfort scores, and EAPR weights were analyzed by paired t tests. SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses.",

This is not unexpected because all respirators alter breathing patterns, and the increased ventilation associated with the (generally) greater dead space of the EAPR compared with FFRs (eg, N95 FFR, and others) usually employed by HCWs, favors an increase in tidal volume over breathing rate because it is more efficient from an energy standpoint.19 A recent review concluded that respirator use has little impact on minute volume during resting or low-intensity work conditions like those normally encountered in health care environments.20\n",

Of concern is the finding that mean transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels, averaged over the course of the last 15 minutes of the EAPR use, were elevated (ie, >45 mm Hg) in 4 of 10 subjects at the 1.7-mph work rate (range, 46-56 mm Hg) and 5 of 10 subjects at the 2.5-mph work rate (range, 45.4-62.8 mm Hg), despite the EAPR being equipped with an exhalation valve that presumably allows for a smaller proportion of the exhaled breath (and associated carbon dioxide) to be retained in the respirator dead space (all subjects were asymptomatic of hypercapnia).21 Furthermore, at the 2 work rates, the mean mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator dead space oxygen concentrations (17.85%, 17.81%, respectively) and respirator dead space carbon dioxide concentrations (2.50%, 2.47%, respectively) did not meet Occupational Health and Safety Administration ambient workplace standards (ie, <19.5% is considered oxygen deficient; maximum 0.5% carbon dioxide as an 8-hour time weighted average),22 although these standards apply to the workplace, not to respirators. Oxygen saturation was not adversely affected. Nonetheless, this raises concerns that extended continuous EAPR wear (>1 hour) might lead to further increases in transcutaneous carbon dioxide that could be deleterious to the wearer. Also, the impact of mild-to-moderate EAPR-associated increased retention of carbon dioxide upon specific subgroups of HCWs who might be more susceptible to hypercapnia (eg, pregnant, asthmatics, and others) needs to be considered. Although the use of other air-purifying respirators (ie, gas masks) for upwards of 2 hours by pregnant women in active labor without adverse effects on mother or fetus has been reported,23 as has tolerance to EAPR use by controlled asthmatics over short periods of mild-to-moderate work activities,24 data are scarce overall.",

Part of this comfort may be related to the low exertion work rates employed in this study, as supported by the fact that no significant differences were noted in the (low) mean exertion scores reported when comparing controls and EAPR use at either work rate. Furthermore, recent findings on HCWs respirator tolerance (a measure of comfort) reported that the same model of an EAPR as used in the current study was tolerated, on average, for 6.8 hours of use.8 Nonetheless, numerous complaints were offered by the current study subjects regarding subjective symptoms and design features (Table 3) that lend some credence to other recent findings that an EAPR, although tolerable, has a greater adverse subjective impact on wearers than N95 FFRs.24\n",

The study subjects had no prior experience with an EAPR, and that could have negatively impacted performance, but this may be a more plausible study group given that most HCWs have not had experience with EAPRs.6 The use of RIP for ventilation data is subject to intra- and interpersonal variability19 and is not as reliable as standard laboratory monitoring equipment (eg, spirometer, pneumotachygraph), but refinements in RIP have led to improved accuracy in recent exercise studies.27, 28 Similarly, transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels are not as precise as arterial measurements, but improvements in sensors have led to greater precision,29, 30 and this technique is not discomforting to the subject and avoids needle puncture-associated complications.

            "text": "Compared with controls over the course of 1 hour at 2 work rates associated with the health care environment, EAPR use by HCWs results in a lower breathing rate and compensatory higher tidal volume. Absolute increases in transcutanous carbon dioxide levels over control values were not statistically significant over the course of 1 hour and not associated with symptomatology of hypercapnia, but variable retention of carbon dioxide occurred in a significant proportion of subjects and is a cause for concern. This will have to be evaluated further in a larger study and over more prolonged periods of continuous use. Subjective ratings indicated that, although an EAPR was tolerable over 1 hour and not associated with significant perceptions of exertion, comfort was negatively impacted.",
