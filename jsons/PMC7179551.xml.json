CoVs were recently divided into four genera based on genotypic and serological characterizations: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales[1]. IBV is distributed worldwide, it is highly infectious, and extremely difficult to control because of its extensive genetic diversity, short generation time, and high mutation rate. Although live-attenuated infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccines have been used worldwide since the 1950s, IBV continues to cause disease in chickens, even in vaccinated birds, because the virus is constantly changing and evolving to avoid the host immune response. IBV can cause respiratory disease in chickens of all ages [2]. Some strains are nephropathogenic, resulting in renal-induced mortality of 25-80% in susceptible flocks [3]. Other strains can replicate in the oviduct and cause permanent damage in immature females or pullets resulting in limited egg production in mature hens [2].",

Like all CoVs, the proximal two thirds of the IBV genome encode two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which are proteolytically cleaved by two virus-encoded replicase proteins, the papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, into at least 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2-16) [4]. Replication of the CoV RNA genome and transcription of a nested set of 5-8 subgenomic RNA species are carried out by these proteinases. However, the exact functions of individual replicases remain largely unknown. The remaining third of the IBV genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Two small accessory genes, genes 3 and 5, have been described in IBV, which express accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b, respectively [3, 5, 6]. In addition, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) in the IBV genome, like those of other CoVs, usually harbor important structural elements involved in replication and/or translation [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].",

As a consequence of this process, the virus becomes more adapted and more highly pathogenic to the embryo, with concomitant attenuation in mature chickens. The IBV strain Beaudette was attenuated after several hundred passages in embryonated hen's eggs [17] resulting in loss of virulence and also potential loss of immunogenicity. A similar result was observed in IBV strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V, the immunogenicity of which was substantially decreased after 110 passages in embryonated hen's eggs, resulting in loss of virulence to chickens [16]. However, most attenuated IB vaccine strains, such as H120, maintain their immunogenicity after adaptation to embryonated chicken eggs [12, 13, 14, 15], though the genomic mutations in passaged strains associated with attenuation of pathogenicity, immunogenicity, tissue tropism, and replication capacity in chicken tissues are unknown and variable, leading to differing efficacies associated with different vaccines.",

In recent years, this type of IBV has also been found in Taiwan [18] and regions of the Middle East, resulting in severe losses to both the layer and broiler industries [19]. Both experimental and field studies suggested that vaccination using available commercial vaccines provided poor protection against this type of virus, emphasizing the need for the development of an efficacious, live-attenuated vaccine against CK/CH/LDL/97I to prevent and control this type of IBV [20]. We previously attempted to develop an IB vaccine by serial passage of the IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I in embryonated eggs [21]. Although the vaccination challenge test showed that the attenuated P115 virus could provide complete protection against the homologous pathogenic parent virus P5, in terms of clinical response and virus recovery in the trachea and kidney [20, 21], the genomic changes in the pathogenic parental CK/CH/LDL/97I strain and its attenuated virus, and the genomic changes associated with attenuation of pathogenicity, immunogenicity, tissue tropism, and replication capacity after serial passages remain unknown.",

This isolate seems to have high affinity for the proventriculus in chickens and is implicated in a novel pathogenicity associated with transmissible proventriculitis [23], though few experimental proventriculitis models have been generated using this type of IBVs. The origin of this virus type remains unknown and no complete genomic sequence for it is available in the GenBank database. The lack of sufficient information limits the comprehensive tracing of the origin and evolution of the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain, but it is noteworthy that this type of IBV was also found in Taiwan [18] and regions of the Middle East in recent years [19]. We identified a close genetic relationship between CK/CH/LDL/97I and the Delaware-type IBVs, which was isolated in the US, by entire genome analysis, suggesting a common origin or epidemiological link between the CK/CH/LDL/97I and Delaware-type IBV strains.",

Consequently, the S protein has been shown to be correlated to the virulence attenuation and broadening of host or cell-type ranges [27, 28]. This protein has also been reported as a determinant of cell tropism in IBV, as some amino acids contained in S protein contribute to attenuation of IBV [29]. Variations in the S1 gene may reduce the ability of CK/CH/LDL/97I P115 to infect host cells after serial passage in eggs, but not its ability to infect the chorioallantoic membrane, where IBV replication initially occurs in embryonated chicken eggs. However, such conclusions should be drawn with caution, as the results of this and other studies found no identical substitutions, insertions, or deletions in S proteins between different pathogenic IBV strains and their embryo-passaged, attenuated derivatives, even though the attenuated IBV strains showed distinctly different biological features, including lack of pathogenicity to 1-day-old SPF chicks compared to the pathogenic parental strains [26, 30, 31]. Some findings suggested that the replicase gene, rather than the S1 or S gene, may be responsible for viral pathogenicity [32, 33].",

The ectodomain region [33] and two heptad repeat regions [34] of subunit S2 are involved in oligomerization of the S protein and required for entry into susceptible cells [35, 36, 37]. Changes in the S2 gene may affect viral entry [32]. In this study, multiple changes in the S2 gene occurred during passage of CK/CH/LDL/97I in embryonated eggs, which may have had an effect on viral entry into chicken host cells in vivo, indirectly decreasing the replication capacity. However, introduction of an S protein from a virulent IBV isolate did not confer virulence to the apathogenic strain Beau-R [29]. A further study showed that replacing all the Beaudette structural and accessory proteins with those from a virulent IBV isolate did not restore virulence [45]. These results suggest that IBV attenuation may not be caused by changes in the S2 gene. However, it has been speculated that changes in the S2 protein may contribute to adaptation of the field virus to chick embryonic tissue [32].",

In the current study, we identified a mutation of nucleotide 184 (C-T) in P115, compared to P5, resulting in an amino acid substitution (Ala\u2192Ser). However, this substitution may have only a minor effect on viral replication after 115 passages in eggs because only the hydrophobic domain (amino acids 12-32) of IBV E is important for efficient viral replication [41]. The cytoplasmic tail of IBV E is responsible for its interaction with IBV M [4], and mutations in the cytoplasmic tail of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) E by targeted RNA recombination resulted in the production of elongated virions [45]. Therefore, substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail of the IBV P115 E protein caused by serial passages warrant further investigations.",

This region contains a potential ORF with an initiation codon immediately downstream of the M gene stop codon in some IBV strains. This study identified a similar 273-nucleotide ORF that potentially encodes a 90-amino acid product in CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 at a similar position; however, this ORF was extended in P115 by two nucleotide insertions, resulting in an ORF of 285 nucleotides that potentially encodes a 11-kD, 94-amino acid product. We could not predict the functions of the ORF in CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 or the potential effect of the insertions. The lack of subgenomic mRNA for this potential ORF, the long distance between the initiation codon and potential transcription regulatory sequence, and the loss of the potential ORF in some IBV strains indicate that this ORF is probably a pseudogene [32]. Furthermore, removal of the intergenic UTR from an apathogenic IBV had no effect on the functionality of the virus [32].",

However, the functions of these proteins in the context of pathogenesis remain poorly understood, although some nsps of other CoVs have been linked to the loss of virulence [32]. Like its homologs in other CoVs, 3CLpro of IBV is encoded by ORF1a and resides in nsp5. This proteinase specifically cleaves polyproteins 1a and 1ab at 11 sites to produce 12 mature products (nsp5-nsp16). A cluster of small nsps, including nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10, is located at the C-terminal region of the 1a polyprotein. Although the functional roles of these proteins in IBV are unknown, roles for these nsps in RNA replication and transcription of other CoVs are emerging from biochemical and structural analyses [48]. In the current study, we found no differences in nucleotide sequences between CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 and P115 in nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, or nsp10. Other groups have attenuated the virulent Ark DPI 11 strain of IBV following 101 passages in embryonated eggs (Ark DPI 101) and compared the complete genomes of both viruses. They identified two and one amino acid substitutions in nsp6 and nsp10, respectively, but none in nsp5, nsp7, or nsp8 [47], as in the present study. In addition, although substitutions were found in nsp4, nsp9, nsp11/12, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16 in our study, these substitutions did not produce amino acid substitutions due to viral subpopulation selection, other than several mutations.",

Of the three amino acid substitutions, one similar substitution was also reported in this coding region between challenge and vaccine M41 strain, and Ark DPI 11 and attenuated DPI 101 [47]. A recent report showed that nsp2 plays a role in facilitating de novo IBV protein synthesis by blocking protein kinase R phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2\u03b1), which shuts down protein synthesis. In addition, nsp2 induces expression of GADD34, which dephosphorylates eIF-2\u03b1 [49]. The nsp3 of CoV contains multiple domains including an acidic domain, an ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase, a papain-like proteinase (PL2pro), a Y domain, and a transmembrane domain [50]. Inactivation of ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase activity in MHV nsp3 reduced viral replication in the livers of infected mice, but did not induce liver disease [51]. Two amino acid substitutions in this study were located in the viral proteinase PL2pro and Y domains, respectively, which were similar to the positions altered between Ark DPI 11 and 101 [47]. The substitution in PL2pro may restrict viral maturation or replication. However, we were unable to predict the effects of the Y-domain change because the role of this domain in IBV is currently unknown. nsp13 contains an RNA helicase and has an important function in viral replication. An amino acid substitution between CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 and P115 was found in the helicase domain at nucleotide position 15859, resulting in an amino acid substitution (Leu\u2192Pro). This substitution was similar to that in the helicase domain of Ark PDI, located at nt 15763. This substitution in the attenuated P115 strain might alter viral replication [47].",

S1 gene sequence analysis demonstrated that distinct virus subpopulations were selected when chickens were vaccinated with live-attenuated IBV strains [21]. Further analysis confirmed that the virus subpopulations differed between microenvironments in distinct host tissues [54]. This investigation did not compare the replication capacities of CK/CH/LDL/97I before and after serial embryo passage in the oviduct of female chickens, or assess damage to the reproductive tract, egg production, or egg quality in laying chickens. However, IBV replication in the epithelium of the oviduct has been shown to result in decreased egg production and quality [55]. The damage is more severe and permanent if young chicks are affected [56], although repeated embryo passage was shown to reduce the virulence of some IBVs in the chicken oviduct [57]. Limited information is currently available regarding the pathogenicity of CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV strains and embryo-passaged, attenuated P115 in the chicken oviduct. Future studies will therefore focus on the effects of these IBV strains on the chicken oviduct.",

The result is still very interesting to understanding of molecular markers of IBV attenuation, tissue tropism, and replication capacity changes, as in the case of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, which showed that two amino acid substitutions at the N-terminus of spike protein resulted in loss of enteric tropism [60]. The current sequence analyses were unable to identify specific amino acid residues responsible for these changes because the attenuated strain differed from the parental strain at multiple positions. Further investigations using reverse genetics and animal studies are therefore necessary to verify the exact functions of these changes. In addition, none of the sequence substitutions were shared by all pathogenic IBV strains or their attenuated derivatives [26, 30, 31, 47], indicating changes in viral replication, pathogenicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, or tissue tropism might be attributable to different genes in the viral genome. However, some of the sequence substitutions identified in this study could be used as the potential molecular markers, at least between the CK/CH/LDL/97I-type pathogenic and attenuated strains, providing important information for the development of specific diagnostics of differentiating CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV infections from vaccination because the attenuated P115 can be used as a potential vaccine candidate [20] to control the circulation of CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBVs in China and regions of the Middle East in recent years [18, 19, 21, 23].",
