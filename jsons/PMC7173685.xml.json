            "text": "Sitagliptin was the first dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) marketed in Taiwan. It was introduced in 2009 followed by vildagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin. DPP-4i has blood glucose-lowering effects by increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). They are second-line oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs listed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) just after metformin [1, 2]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), also known as CD26, a transmembrane type II glycoprotein belonging to the prolyl oligopeptidase family, is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes [3]. Since DPP-4 has wide distribution, it is involved in a great number of physiological processes. Evidence has shown that DPP-4 plays a role in chemotaxis, signal transduction, T cell-mediated immune responses and lymphokine synthesis [4\u20136]. Hence, apart from its role in glucose homeostasis, CD26/DPP-4 expression may be associated with various pathogenic conditions such as autoimmune disease [7], inflammatory disease and malignancies [8].",

Many studies discovered decreased expression of both CD26 and levels of DPP-4 activity in subjects with RA, a systemic inflammatory disease involving joint destruction. Animal models demonstrated increased severity of RA resulting from lower DPP-4 activity in the synovial fluid of CD26 knockout mice [18, 19]. Several case reports demonstrated cases of DPP-4 inhibitor-induced synovitis [20], RA or polyarthritis [21\u201323]. In addition, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also warned in 2015 that DPP-4i treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may cause severe joint pain. Until now, while DPP-4 has several biological functions in proinflammatory pathways [24, 25], the exact pathological pathways and influence of DPP-4 on the immune system, particularly autoimmune disorders, are not well known. Little has been studied about the relationships between DPP-4 inhibitors, RA and other autoimmune disorders and the possible mechanism behind these relationships.",

We extracted data from the diabetes subsection of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Because Sitagliptin was the first marketed DPP-4i in Taiwan, which was started to extensively wide prescribed since 2009, we choose the time frame from 2009 to 2013 for cumulative analysis of occurrences of autoimmune diseases. We recruited patients age \u2265 20 years with ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for T2DM (ICD-9-CM: 250.XX) [28, 29]. We further divided participants into a DPP-4i group and a control (DPP-4i-na\u00efve) group. The DPP-4i group was defined as patients receiving any prescription of DPP-4i during the cohort period. DPP-4i drugs of interest included four types: sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin. The index date of the DPP-4i group was defined as the earliest date of DPP-4i prescription. The index date of the DPP-4i-na\u00efve group is the date randomly assigned by duration from the day of DM diagnosis to the DPP-4i prescription date of the DPP-4i group. Conducting this matching of prescription time-distribution allowed us to avoid the imbalance of prescription times between the two groups, which can lead to survival bias. The exclusion criteria were as follows: type 1 DM, age younger than 20 years or older than 80 years, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or malignancy diagnosed before enrollment, and those who had used incretin-based drugs before the index date (Supplementary Figure). The participants aged older than 80 years were considered the immunocompromised population; hence, they were excluded to reduce the possibility to alter the outcomes. The study cohort was followed continuously until December 31, 2013.",

The baseline characteristics of the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na\u00efve groups were well balanced after PS matching. The mean age of the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na\u00efve groups was around 60.2 versus 60.1 years, respectively. The age groups of 20\u201340 years were 4.9% versus 5.1%, 41\u201360 years were 42.8% versus 43%, and 61\u201380 years were 52.4% versus 51.9% in the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na\u00efve groups, respectively.

T2DM duration was below 5 years in 38.8% of participants in the DPP-4i group versus 39.7% in the DPP-4i-na\u00efve group; T2DM duration was between 6 and 10 years in 27.1% of participants in the DPP-4i group versus 28.3% in the DPP-4i-na\u00efve group, and was more than 11 years in 34.1% versus 32% of participants in the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na\u00efve groups, respectively.

There were several in vitro and in vivo evidences showing that the human DPP4 was correlated with susceptibility of infection. For examples, in 2013 Professor Raj et al. had identified human DPP-4 as the receptor for MERS-CoV that mediates infection [32]. Later in 2018, Prof. Fan also found the high susceptibility of infection by MERS-CoV in the transgene mouse model of global over-expression of human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [33]. Taken together, these evidences showed that human DPP-4 (CD26) acted as key transmembrane glycoprotein that potentially mediated infection and inflammation. In addition, DPP-4i was generally considered to decrease chemotaxis, T cell immunity and lymphokines, which may act as the potential mechanism to reduce the incidence of autoimmune diseases. The above evidences were consistently correspondent with our findings that DPP-4 inhibitors users were correlated with the decreased incidence of autoimmune diseases as well as a decreased infection rate compared with non-DPP-4 inhibitors users in type 2 diabetic patients in our nationwide population-based cohort study.",

For example, a case report demonstrated that psoriatic skin lesions improved 3 months after introduction of sitagliptin in a 35-year-old patient with underlying psoriasis and T2DM [35]. In addition, another population-based study conducted by Kim et al. found that DPP-4 inhibitors may reduce the risk of RA and composite autoimmune disease [36]. Another population-based cohort study using Korean National Health Insurance Claims Database found that the risk of incident RA and composite AD was decreased for DPP4i initiators compared with non-DPP4i initiators, which was consistent with our findings [37]. Our cohort study, which had a follow-up period of 5 years between January 2009 and December 2013, is distinct because we included large Asian population (387,099 in DPP-4i group vs. 387,099 in DPP-4i-naive group). In addition, we also first demonstrated the detailed subgroup analysis regarding comorbidities, T2DM duration and prescription of anti-diabetic drugs. We are also the first to perform the comparison of HRs between four kinds of DPP-4 inhibitors and the analysis of dose-dependent response.",

Although we included a wide range of variables such as comorbidities and non-studied medications using the claims data from 12 months prior to the index date to balance the two groups, a 12-month period may not be long enough to detect all baseline information of the potential confounders associated with autoimmune disease. Second, the severity of T2DM could not be evaluated properly because no biochemistry data were available. Nevertheless, we matched the T2DM diagnosis duration and glucose-lowering medications between the two groups, finding that the T2DM severity is relatively equal between the groups. Third, we relied on diagnosis codes without available images, laboratory data or disease-specific immunomodulating medications prescriptions for the outcomes. In order to strengthen ascertainment, we also identified catastrophic illness certification for each outcome. Nevertheless, several autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis were not fit for catastrophic illness certificate in Taiwan, which was absolutely definite in differentiation of etiology of each diagnosis of rare diseases. Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate the etiology of autoimmune thyroid disease solely from the ICD-9-CM codes recorded in the NHI research database in spite of the confirmation by laboratory results of thyroid-related autoantibody in the current study designs.",
