            "text": "Seasonal influenza infection can be a burden on public health authorities. Rapid diagnosis is an important initial step in the appropriate management of influenza disease. Traditionally, viral cultures, serological tests, rapid antigen tests, and molecular methods have been used to diagnose influenza infection.1 Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) have been used widely in the clinical setting because they can be handled readily and at relatively low cost, although they have low and variable detection sensitivities. Thus, a negative RIDT result does not confirm a status free of influenza virus infection. The clinical sensitivities of these tests have been reported to range from 20% to 90%, according to sample collection method, storage and transport, specimen type, swab and transport media used, and degree of adherence to manufacturers' recommendations for test procedures.1 The performance of RIDTs is also dependent on the prevalence of the influenza viruses circulating in the population.2, 3 Furthermore, clinicians should be cautious about using RIDTs in certain patient populations and with respect to how the results should be interpreted.3, 4, 5 Thus, further validation of RIDTs should be provided before routine clinical use. In this study, we compared three RIDTs with digital readout systems, and one conventional RIDT, with respect to the detection sensitivity and relative limit of detection according to influenza subtype.",

Briefly, an antibody colloidal gold probe was applied on the conjugate pad, and influenza antibody was immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane as the capture reagent to prepare the RIDT strip test. Equal volumes of specimen in UTM (75 \u03bcL) and reagent buffer (75 \u03bcL) were mixed thoroughly and five drops (100 \u03bcL) of mixed sample was loaded into the test device. In 15 minutes, the BUDDI device reads the intensity of the reaction band. If the band intensity is higher than a cut\u2010off level, BUDDI reports a positive result of influenza infection. This test required less than 30 minutes to accomplish the qualitative detection of influenza antigen. The results of the BUDDI system can be transferred to a central laboratory or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) via an appropriate wireless network.",

This assay can be completed within 15 minutes, and results are reported as positive or negative for influenza virus A or B, without providing the numerical value assigned for each specimen. Briefly, equal volumes of specimen in UTM (250 \u03bcL) and reagent buffer (prepared by reconstituting lyophilized buffer with detergent and reducing agent, 250 \u03bcL) were mixed in a reaction tube. A final volume of 120 \u03bcL of sample was placed in a Sofia reaction cassette using a premeasured pipette, incubated for 15 minutes, and analyzed using the Sofia fluorescent reader.

The system comprises a unique reagent tube containing mucolytic agents and a detergent solution, a test device, and a digital reader. When nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens are processed with the reagent tube and added to the test device, influenza A or B viral antigens bind to anti\u2010influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles in the test strip. The antigen\u2010conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area, and is captured by antibodies against influenza A, influenza B, and a control antibody on three separate membranes.6 For this study, 75 \u03bcL of specimen in UTM was mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (75 \u03bcL). Three drops (80 \u03bcL) of the mixed sample were placed into a Veritor test device cassette and allowed 10 minutes for incubation.

The reaction band of BUDDI is digitalized according to reaction intensity. Final results of BUDDI can be transferred through a network to another place to help rapid diagnosis. The sensitivities were higher in the digital readout systems than in the \u201cconventional\u201d RIDT, as we expected. Sofia showed the highest sensitivity for influenza A and B detection. BUDDI showed the same sensitivity as Veritor. The cause of the difference may be related to the immunofluorescence technology of Sofia, which enhances its sensitivity. In this study, we identified 66 influenza H1N1 subtype among 73 influenza A type persons (90.4%) through real\u2010time PCR. It is important to understand the detection power of RIDT according to the influenza subtypes. Because influenza shows seasonal variations, specific influenza subtypes should be considered in upgrade of RIDTS.",

There were some differences in detection power according to NIBSC subtype. BUDDI showed high detection sensitivity for A/Texas/36/91, A/Beijing/262/95, and A/Sydney/5/97. Sofia showed high detection sensitivity for A/Texas/36/91, A/Singapore/1/57, A/Vietnam/1194/2004, and A/Cambodia/RO405050/2007. Veritor showed high detection sensitivity for A/Sydney/5/97, A/New York/55/2004, A/Vietnam/1194/2004, and A/Cambodia/RO405050/2007. However, specific subtypes, such as A/Beijing/32/92 (Bioline) and A/Equine/Newmarket/1/93 (Sofia and Bioline), B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (BUDDI, Veritor and Bioline), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (BUDDI, Veritor and Bioline), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (BUDDI, Veritor and Bioline), could not be detected at the level of the 512 ng/mL NIBSC stock solution. These differences could be caused by different coverage levels of monoclonal antibodies to specific influenza subtypes. RIDTs should be updated to target prevalent influenza subtypes and to identify many influenza subtypes (to increase detection sensitivity).",

Second, the mean age of the enrolled individuals was relatively young, at 10\u201032.2 years, for a random selection within a specific period. Cruz et al.2 reported that the performance of RIDTs have been known to be better in children compared with adults (approximately 13% higher), maybe due to higher viral loads and longer viral shedding in children compared with adults. We also identified the higher sensitivity of four RIDTs in children group than those of adults in our study. Third, test results were compared only with those of real\u2010time PCR, which could have false positives and negatives. Also, only nasopharyngeal swab specimens were included, without considering specimen variations. However, for the first time, this study presented the detection sensitivity of a newly developed digital readout system, BUDDI. The BUDDI had the same detection sensitivity as a previously launched RIDT (Veritor), and higher sensitivity than a conventional RIDT. However, BUDDI showed less sensitivity than Sofia. Also, BUDDI could detect more than other RIDTs in terms of specific influenza biotypes, such as influenza A A/Texas/36/91, A/Beijing/262/95, and A/Sydney/5/97.",
