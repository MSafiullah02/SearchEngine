The model describes the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to capture dynamics also based on human habits and geographical features. To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy, which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020. Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of crucial medical resources.",

To arrest the spread of the disease, governments have enacted unprecedented measures, including quarantines, curfews, lockdowns, and suspension of travel. The wide-reaching ramifications of such measures, deemed by many experts as necessary, are driven in part by a lack of clear information about the spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19. Indeed, the absence of reliable data regarding disease transmission has necessarily led to cautious responses. These recent events, which have required important decisions based on forecasts, have demonstrated more than ever the need for reliable tools intended to model the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases [15] . A particularly urgent need is the geo-localization of outbreaks, as this may allow a more effective allocation of medical resources.",

Some models aim at offering specific evaluations of policy responses based on the implementation of different social distancing measures with combined compartmental and empirical approaches [5] [6] [7] . Rather than adopting a deterministic, mechanism-based model, Zhang et al. employed a statistical approach to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 [17] . In Gatto et al. a combined statistical and compartmental approach was employed, in which spatial dependence is addressed by dividing the region of interest (Italy) into local communities connected by a network structure [6] .",

We leverage a compartmental SEIRD (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, deceased ) model that incorporates the spatial spread of the disease with inhomogeneous diffusion terms [8, 9, 11, 12] . The rationale is that the diffusion operator, properly tuned to account for local natural or social inhomogeneities (e.g., mountains, rivers, highways) may describe the local movement of the different populations in a deterministic way, as the limit of a Brownian motion [16] . This is critical to accurately account for information relevant to the outbreak dynamics, such as local population densities, which vary in space and time. While a mathematical description of non-local dynamics is still possible in terms of fractional differential operators [10] , we postpone this approach to a follow-up of the present work.",

Each of these parameters may depend on time, space, or the model compartments. We also consider the Allee effect (depensation), characterized by the parameter A. In this particular setting, the Allee effect serves to model the tendency of outbreaks to cluster towards large population centers. Specific parameter selection as well as initial and boundary conditions are discussed in Section 3. Fig. 1 shows the dynamics of contagion between the compartments in our model. We remark that our model accounts for asymptomatic transmission, which is considered a pivotal driver of the COVID-19 pandemic [3, 7, 14] . Eqs. (1)-(2) show that exposed asymptomatic patients may transmit COVID-19 to susceptible individuals at contact rate \u03b2 e . This aligns with recent studies suggesting that patients may transmit COVID-19 almost immediately after exposure [3, 7, 14] . Additionally, Eqns. (2) and (4) involve a fraction \u03c6 e of exposed patients that do not develop symptoms and move directly into the recovered population. We also assume that recovered patients are immune, as we do not include any backflow from Eq. (4) to Eq. (1). (We note that this is a current source of debate, but consistent with the existing literature for the time scale of months considered here [13] ). The spatial movement over a large population is described by an inhomogeneous random walk, which in the limit tends to a second order differential operator [16] . The diffusivity coefficient is proportional to the population and can be locally adjusted to incorporate geographical or human-related inhomogeneities [9] .",

We still consider the changes in parameter values induced by the sequential restrictions (see Section 3) and the lockdown relaxation is modeled by setting \u03bd s,e,r = 2.175 \u00b7 10 \u22122 km 2 \u00b7 day \u22121 and \u03b2 i,e = 9.0 \u00b7 10 \u22125 contacts \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 (scenario A), and \u03b2 i,e = 6.6 \u00b7 10 \u22125 contacts \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 (scenario B). Scenario A is a pessimistic scenario, which assumes that the population contact rate is similar to early-outbreak levels. Scenario B is more optimistic and assumes that the generally greater public awareness of preventative measures (such as mask-wearing and social distancing) translates to greater success in limiting contact, despite increased mobility. Fig. 3 shows the resulting outbreak dynamics for these four reopening scenarios. Our simulations suggest that relaxing the lockdown restrictions in the entire region may cause severe and rapid growth in the Milan area. However, major urban zones far from Milan (e.g., Brescia and Bergamo) just experience a marginal increase in growth and still show a favorable trend in time. Conversely, if we maintain the lockdown restrictions in Milan and relax them elsewhere, the outbreak shows more favorable dynamics, similar to those obtained for Brescia and Bergamo. Thus, our results suggest that maintenance of lockdown measures in high-population, high-density areas like Milan may be necessary for longer times to effectively arrest the spread of contagious diseases like COVID-19.",

This would further increase the utility of the model, potentially helping decision-makers to determine the allocation of resources among different areas. The present results clearly pinpoint the current standpoints of virologists, emphasizing the need of restrictions. Finally, the socio-economical costs of lockdowns are not included here, but could ultimately be incorporated in future quantitative analyses, e.g., aiming at the comprehensive optimization of pandemic-arresting measures.",
