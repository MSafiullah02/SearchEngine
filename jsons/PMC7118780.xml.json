There are several causes of malocclusion, which is the most common dental abnormality seen in pet rabbits. Congenital deformity, trauma, dietary problems, and neoplasia (eg, mandibular osteosarcoma) are also seen [1]. Mandibular and maxillary abscesses associated with dental infections are common. Periodontal disease and pulpitis are often involved, especially in cases of iatrogenic longitudinal fractures caused by teeth clipping.",

In cases where gastric reflux is suspected, an antacid should be administered. H2 receptor antagonists will reduce gastric acid, and have also been shown to have concentration-dependent prokinetic effects on the rabbit stomach fundus and sigmoid colon; the order of potency was ranitidine > famotidine > cimetidine [20].

Gastrotomy feeding tubes may be required in severe cases to allow optimum mucosal healing while preventing ileus and hepatic lipidosis. Antibiotics effective against anaerobes (eg, metronidazole) may be indicated. Further investigation into the incidence, etiology, and prognosis of spontaneous esophagitis is required.

Prevalence increased with age (15% were over 2 years of age), and was also seen more commonly in females. A suggested etiology was stress-induced ulceration, as a consequence of stress of disease [21]. Similar lesions were reproduced with intraperitoneal injection of adrenaline, in rabbits [22]. Another mechanism for fundic ulceration is hypovolemic shock, where lesions can develop with in 3 hours [23]. Fundic ulcers occurred as small, multiple, shallow erosions of the gastric mucosa, and none were perforated [21].",

Generalized ileus is a common continuation of this condition, and may arise from mechanical obstruction or from defective propulsion. Mechanical obstruction (eg, dehydrated impacted ingesta secondary to chronic dehydration, foreign bodies, and infiltrative lesions) cause delayed gastric empting. Abnormalities in myenteric neuronal or gastric smooth muscle function or contractility result in defective propulsion. Primary factors associated with these functional disorders include anorexia, high-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet, postsurgical adhesions, lack of exercise, toxin ingestion (lead). Secondary factors include pain and environmental stressors such as proximity of predators or a dominant rabbit, change in group hierarchy, loss of a companion, change in housing, routine, or diet, transport, extremes of temperatures, or humidity [27]. Anorexia and chronic dehydration are both causal factors and consequences of gastric stasis and ileus. Systemic dehydration leads to gut content dehydration and impaction of normal stomach contents, which includes loose hair lattices or trichobezoars. One study found the prevalence of trichobezoars, weighing 1 to 24 g, to be 23.1% (n = 208) [16].",

Nasogastric tubes are easily placed in a conscious calm or weak rabbit, in a similar manner to that used in a cat. Radiography is always recommended to ensure the tube is in the correct position (\nFig. 3). Some rabbits will tolerate the tube without an Elizabethan collar, which will enable eating, caecotrophy, and is less stressful (\nFig. 4). Blended and strained food can then be fed, flushing with 5 mL of water before and after feeding will keep the tube patent. Nasogastric tubes can be left in place for several days. Antibiotic therapy such as enrofloxacin (Baytril; 10\u201330 mg/kg orally subcutaneously, every 24 hours) is advisable to help prevent rhinitis, which may develop if nasal tissue was traumatized.",

Analgesia, the author's preference, is for buprenorphine or pethidine (Pethidine; 5\u201310 mg/kg intramuscularly or subcutaneously), shock doses of intravenous or intraosseous crystalloid solution, and systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered. Prokinetics are contraindicated with an obstructive condition before surgery, but are useful postoperatively to stimulate gastrointestinal motility. Gastric decompression via nasogastric or orogastric tube should always be attempted. Where possible serum electrolyte concentrations and acid-base status should be evaluated, acidosis and ketosis may be present. Systolic arterial blood pressure should be measured, where hypovolaemic is suspected. Doppler measurement requires a 1- or 2-sized cuff (Critikon neonatal SOFT-CUF, GE Medical Systems, Information Technologies Gmbh, Freiburg, Germany) to be placed just proximal to the right elbow, ensuring cuff width was 50% of the circumference of this region. Conduction gel and the transducer are applied to the palmar distal, antebrachial surface, over the palmar common digital artery. Inflation of the cuff occludes the artery, then gradual deflation until the transducer detects the reentry of blood to the artery. The pressure measurement on the manometer correlates to systolic pressure. A mean of six readings should be used the reference range of 100\u2013110 mm Hg, has been described in rabbits [41]. Following the same principles as used in cats and dogs, fluid therapy has been used to correct hypovolaemia in rabbits. Postsurgical adhesions have been minimized by the use of the calcium channel-blocking agent, verapamil (Verapamil, Securon) (200 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneously every 8 hours for 9 days) [42]. Analgesia, fluids, and nutritional support should be continued postoperatively. Prognosis is guarded to poor, as most rabbits have severe hepatic lipidosis, acidosis, ketosis, and severe gastric ulceration. Severe gastric ulceration could progress to perforation with subsequent peritonitis. Perforation carries a grave prognosis. Aggressive and early treatment will improve rate of recovery.",

The enterococci were found to be resistant to a pH 3 broth, and transient inoculated enterococcal populations were demonstrated, suggesting colonization may occur, although further investigation is required [47].
