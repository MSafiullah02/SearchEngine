Results showed that the two allergens of pistachio significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria as well as two fungi. Moreover, they exerted significant in vitro cytotoxic activities against Human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), human colon carcinoma (HTC), human glioblastoma (U-87-MG), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and human prostate cell lines (PC3 and DU-145). Our findings revealed that the highest antimicrobial effect of the allergens was found against M. loteus (MIC = 10 \u00b5g/mL). The lowest IC 50 value was found for Pis v 2.0101 allergen (11S globulin) against CV-B4 (30.20 \u00b1 1.01 \u00b5g/mL). Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed IC 50 values ranging from 21.09 \u00b1 0.55 to 34.52 \u00b1 0.90 and 26.34 \u00b1 0.88 to 38.63 \u00b1 0.80 \u00b5g/mL for Pis v 2.0101 (11S globulin) and Pis v 1 (2S albumin), respectively. As these allergens presented considerable effects against biofilm-related infections, CV-B2-5, and several cell lines, they might be employed as alternative/complementary treatments after further preclinical and clinical studies.",

Pistacia vera L. is recognized as a delicious nut with several nutritional benefits [30] . Due to its highly favorable taste, nutritional value, and health promoting composition, it is consumed worldwide as a snack (fresh or roasted and salted), pistachio halva, pistachio milk, pistachio butter, etc. Furthermore, pistachio is normally used as an ingredient in cakes, confectionery products, biscuits, candies, ice creams and chocolates [28, 31] . Pistachio contains various essential nutrients that can contribute to a healthy diet [10] . It means that pistachio allergens are from protein families of 2S albumins (Pis v 1), legumins (Pis v 2 and Pis v 5), vicilins (Pis v3), and iron/ manganese superoxide dismutase (Pis v 4) [11] . It is obvious that certain allergenic proteins, typically those which are stable towards heat and digestion, are the primary cause of an immune response [18] . Characterization of pistachio allergens helps to explain the possible cross-reactivity among tree nut allergens and is the first step towards development of better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [1] .",

As a highly sensitive apparatus, Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been employed to detect multiple allergens in nuts [18, 19] .

The auto MS/MS was also operated for the most intense precursor ions that were selected via single MS before, by considering > 15,000 counts from 600 to 2100 m/z. For MS/MS, nitrogen was used as collision gas and the collision energy was 10 eV. The MS/ MS spectrum was operated in the positive ion as follows: Agilent at 3 spectra/sec over 60-2100 m/z with capillary voltage 4000 V, nozzle voltage 1000 V, fragmentor voltage 160 V, and collision energy of 10 eV.",

Searches were based on a mass tolerance window of 20 ppm for precursor ion and 50 ppm window for the product ions around the measured m/z. The search used trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages with no modifications. The LC-MS data from the tryptic digests of pistachio proteins were searched to identify peptide sequences from the major peaks in the LC-MS run and to match the identified peptide to a specific pistachio protein. A MS scoring algorithm was used to match ions present in the spectrum with the sequence based upon factors described by Kapp et al. [13] . Scores of 15 and above are well assigned fragmentation and correct interpretation. Scores that were greater than 10 were very good and usually right. Spectrum Mill was used to confirm the amino acid sequences based on the acquired MS spectra as a secondary confirmation of the postulated sequence. Spectrum Mill was also used to verify that these sequences were unique to the pistachio analyzed (based on the search sequence in the green plant NCBInr database using MS Edman program) and would not be found in other nuts or green plants. The sequencing process was done at Department of Molecular Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gda\u0144sk, Poland [18] .",

            "text": "Since synthetic antibiotics have become less effective or even ineffective, peptides have been considered for development of new antibiotics. Many peptides are known to play important roles in immunomodulation, promotion of wound healing during the clearance of infection, and antiviral activity against HIV-1. They can incorporate into the eukaryotic cells and interact with the members of mitochondria inducing membrane depolarization and tumor cell death via activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways [20] . In the present work, we found that these allergens have considerable antimicrobial effects against Gram-positive, Gramnegative and fungal as well as Coxsackie viruses and possess A2780, HTC, U-87-MG, MCF-7, PC3, DU-145 cytotoxic properties. It was previously shown that melittin isolated from the venom of Iranian honey bee, possesses broad antimicrobial spectra as well as anticancer properties [20] . By the advent of molecular biology techniques, many studies examined antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer activities of proteins isolated from different sources such as plants, mammals, marine invertebrates, and insects. For example, the peptide obtained from the wheat endosperm, purothionin, showed antibiotic activities [15] . The cytoplasmic membranes of microbes are lipid-rich and the antimicrobial proteins can easily interact with the cytoplasmic membrane of pathogens using their charged-hydrophobic structure [17] . Based on our antimicrobial assessments, the most susceptible strains were Gram-positive bacteria. Biological evaluations revealed that it is easier for antimicrobial proteins to enter Gram-positive peptidoglycan layer compared to Gram-negative hydrophilic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) which show higher degree of resistance towards hydrophobic antimicrobial compounds [23] .",

In addition, antimicrobial proteins can exhibit antitumor and antiviral effects [27] . It has been reported that two allergens of pistachio inhibited several group B Coxsackie viruses. Pharmacological activities of pistachio allergens were attributed to their antiviral potential. Our data showed that both allergens, markedly affected CV-B2-5 viability. Viral membrane fusion inhibitory activity of these proteins may be related to their lipopeptide-based structure [37] . It was indicated that tryptophan-rich, C8 (Ac-Trp-Glu-Asp-Trp-Val-Gly-Trp-Ile-NH2) plays a major role against the membrane-proximal external region of the feline immune deficiency virus (FIV) [8] . It seems that the inhibitory action is related to adsorption of the peptide on the plasma membrane of the target cell, where it can inhibit interactions between virus fusion glycoprotein [7] . Adsorbed peptide supports the cell from the fusion glycoprotein of the virus and it is directly due to the fundamental peptide; however, small peptides may exhibit no antiviral activity because of their conformational instability [8] . In another study using FTIR spectroscopy, a secondary structure consisting of an N-terminal beta-sheet along with a turn and C-terminal beta-sheet was introduced as a new class of anti-HCV compounds [14] .",

Interestingly, HTC cells were found to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of both allergens compared to the other cell lines. In a previous study, R-lycosin-I modified by amino acid substitution from lycosin-I, showed anticancer activity and inhibited cell proliferation [12] . In another research, fatty acids with different chain lengths were introduced to the N-terminal of R-lycosin-I; this modification increased cytotoxic activity of these lipopeptides against A549 cells [12] . Also, Tag7 was reported to be an innate immune protein that is involved in the antibacterial and antitumor effects [24] . Moreover, Tag7 complex with Hsp70 showed cytotoxic effects in many tumor cell lines. It seems that Tag7 can activate cytotoxic lymphocyte subpopulations [25] . Cytotoxicity of proteins may be exerted through different mechanisms including disruption of cell membrane integrity via depolarization, reducing the activity of membrane-bound enzymes, modification of the mevalonate pathway of metabolism and/or induction of apoptosis [35] .",
