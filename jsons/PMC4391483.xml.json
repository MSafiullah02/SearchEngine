Furthermore, the WHO estimates that acute respiratory infections account for 1.9 to 2.2 million childhood deaths annually, with 42% occurring in Africa [2,3]. Bacterial infections, especially those that cause pneumonia, are important because they substantially contribute to childhood mortality [4-7]. Viruses also play a role, because primary infection with viral pathogens can pre-dispose children to secondary bacterial infection [8-10], and a viral diagnosis can minimize the overuse of antibiotics [11]. Furthermore, co-infection with multiple respiratory pathogens is common [12-15].",

However, only 128 (4.3%) of 2,976 patients with respiratory illness in 2011\u20132012 were positive for influenza. As such, it is necessary to broaden detection to include other respiratory pathogens, to estimate the scope of disease burden and determine which respiratory pathogens are commonly identified in SARI patients. There has been little research into non-influenza pathogens identified in SARI patients in Zambia. As a result, little is known about the pathogens involved in severe respiratory infections affecting children under five in Zambia.",

Specimens were processed only if the internal control human ribonuclease gene had a cycle threshold \u226435, indicating a high-quality specimen [13]. Of the specimens collected during the study period, 4.3% tested positive for influenza; these were excluded from the study. The singleplex assay targeted seven viruses, while the multiplex targeted thirty-three bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Both methods were internally controlled and semi-quantitative. The methods were not directly compared; different sets of samples were used for each method. Therefore, analysis for each method is presented separately.",

Viral pathogens were detected in 184/297 (62.0%) of the samples by singleplex and in 167/199 (83.9%) of the samples by multiplex assay. The higher percentage in the multiplex is likely due to CMV, which was the most commonly detected virus with the multiplex but was not a target of the singleplex assay. The high prevalence of CMV in our study is intriguing, and while in the current study we cannot determine if CMV is the cause of SARI in children where CMV was identified, we plan to further examine the potential role of CMV in SARI in the future.",

These molecular methods demonstrate the need to continuously monitor and detect new emerging viruses responsible for acute respiratory illnesses. Historically, respiratory illnesses have been associated with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus [29,30]. However, with the development of newer, broad spectrum and sensitive molecular techniques, other viruses in patients with respiratory tract infections are being detected [30]. Our results point to the need to further explore and better understand the role of co-infections in children. We report a high proportion of dual viral/bacterial infections from the multiplex assay 167/199 (83.9%) which calls for careful consideration when associating particular pathogens with specific diseases [31]. Nevertheless, other data from different studies have repeatedly offered evidence indicating virus/bacterial coinfections in the respiratory tract [32-35].",

No distinct seasonality was observed for most of the respiratory pathogens, but RSV and HMPV were preferentially detected at particular times of the year. A similar pattern was observed in a study conducted in South Africa, where particular pathogens (RSV and HPIV-3) were detected at different times of year while others like HBoV, HRV and HADV were detected throughout the year [36].

A related limitation is lack of case follow-up, meaning that the disease severities were not recorded. Also, because influenza negative specimens were tested, co-infection rates among patients infected with influenza virus could not be examined. Most of the specimens were collected in 2012, which means that the seasonality we report was primarily based on 2012. Lastly, this study design did not include non-SARI controls, and as such we are not able to associate pathogen detection with disease severity or clinical diagnosis, and that we cannot determine whether microbiological findings reflect true infection with causative agents, or merely colonization in coincidentally ill children.",
