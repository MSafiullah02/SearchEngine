The COVID-19 pandemic will soon present a new problem; prolonged ventilation and the need for tracheostomy. At our institution, we have yet to be forced to use these procedures to free up resources (including ventilators), and recommend they be performed in a controlled and safe environment to minimize transmission to providers. This protocol has been used on 1 patient who over 28 days of intubation, had improved ventilator settings and had an opportunity of recovery. Before the implementation of this protocol, we conducted numerous dry runs with special attention to the mechanics, ease of use and set-up, and visibility of surgical site. Importantly, it was noted that if there is any malfunction regarding the overlying clear drape, simple removal of the drape can be done without re-draping or further complication to the operation. Ultimately, this protocol allows the hospital staff to minimize the risk and exposure of the virus to the hospital staff.",
