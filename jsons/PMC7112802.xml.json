            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause a variety of illnesses in humans and animals (Lai, 1990, Lavi et al., 1999, Perlman, 1998, Snijder and Horzinek, 1993, Snijder et al., 1993, Zhou et al., 2004). Most human coronaviruses (HCoVs) fall into one of two serotypes, OC43-like and 229E-like; however, the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was quickly linked to infection with a novel CoV, SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003), and HCoV-NL63, has been recognized recently as a human pathogen (van der Hoek et al., 2004). The CoV genome encodes numerous non-structural proteins and four or five structural proteins including the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), small envelope (E), and (in some) strains a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein (Lai, 1990). SARS-CoV has four structural proteins, the S, N, M, and E proteins that have various functions. The S protein forms spikes on the virion surface and is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. It also induces protective immunity, and is associated with host range, tissue tropism and virulence (Sanchez et al., 1999). The N protein forms the nucleocapsid; the M protein interacts with the nucleocapsid and forms the internal viral core; and the E protein is associated with the viral envelope. SARS-CoV is genetically distinct from previously described coronaviruses, which have been placed into three antigenic groups: I, II, and III. Human coronaviruses, i.e., 229E-like and OC43-like, belong to groups I and II, respectively, and are recognized as the second most common cause of upper respiratory disease, but are associated infrequently with serious lower respiratory tract disease (El-Sahly et al., 2000, Hendley et al., 1972, Makela et al., 1998, Falsey et al., 2002). However, SARS-CoV is usually associated with serious lower respiratory tract disease, having a fatality rate as ranging between 10% and 15% that may be as high as 50% in patients >60 years of age (Drosten et al., 2003, Enserink, 2003, Holmes, 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Although the global spread of SARS-CoV was stopped in June 2003, six instances of laboratory-acquired infections have been confirmed and a cluster of sporadic cases have been detected in Guangdong Province, China, between December 2003 and April 2004 (Liang et al., 2004), demonstrating the potential for SARS to re-emerge and possibly become pandemic.",

On the basis of results from studies of other coronavirus infections in animals (Daniel and Talbot, 1990, De Diego et al., 1992, Ignjatovic and Galli, 1993, Kusters et al., 1989, Saif, 1993) and on the serum antibody response of patients with SARS (Che et al., 2003), the antibody response to SARS-CoV appears to be dominated by anti-N protein and anti-S protein antibodies. Thus, mAbs reactive to N or S proteins can be used in antibody capture assays and provide a key reagent for high-quality IgM and IgA antibody assays. In addition, the anti-S protein mAbs can be used to study virus neutralization, and to better understand the function of the two epitopes against which they react.",

In addition, three groups have described neutralizing human mAbs reactive against SARS-CoV (Sui et al., 2004, Traggiai et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2004). In this study, the authors show the availability of murine mAbs reactive to the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV and two S protein epitopes that fill an important gap in immunological tools needed to further explore the biology of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis of disease. The mAbs should help the development of diagnostic assays and studies examining the biology of infection and pathogenesis of disease.",
