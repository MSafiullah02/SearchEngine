A rapid decreasing proportion of positive HCWs might be the consequence of a rapid inflation of the total positive cases in the general population or of a strong regional response based on tailored and immediate public health interventions. On the other hand, the proportional stability (~15.0%) might be explained by the high regional burden of infected individuals over the previous weeks (46,071 cumulative cases by April 2). In regions where the proportion of infected HCWs is increasing or is still very high, appropriate public health measures to curb the trend should be implemented and scaled up.",

Regional dynamics are significantly affected by local events, such as incident clusters of disease, as well as adoption and adaptation of national preparedness plans and their appropriate implementation. Furthermore, accurate and continuous monitoring of local data is needed, and the responses to emergencies must be adapted in the most granular way. As emphasized by the recent World Health Organization (WHO) Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Framework (HEDRM), monitoring and evaluation is a critical step in the risk management cycle and can be applied in any moment of the continuum, from prevention and mitigation to preparedness, response, and recovery.8 Recording and reporting regional data on infections among HCWs should be comprehensively coordinated by the ISS. Reports should be published to provide key feedback to the scientific community to facilitate participation in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.",
