In support of this speculation, the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 deaths in the aforementioned regions were all well fitted to the Boltzmann function (R\n2 all being close to 0.999) (Figs. 1B, 1C and Table 1). The potential total numbers of deaths were estimated to be 3,200\u00b140 in China, 108\u00b11 in Hubei, 3,100\u00b140 outside Hubei, 2,500\u00b140 in Wuhan City, and 604\u00b16 outside Wuhan (Table 1). These results, in conjunction with our earlier observation that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases of 2003 SARS in mainland China and worldwide were well fitted to the Boltzmann function, prompted us to analyze the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS deaths in the same way. The cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong, and worldwide were all well fitted to the Boltzmann function (Fig. 1D), strongly suggesting that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate the course of deaths associated with coronavirus-caused diseases.",

For instance, 134 new deaths were suddenly counted from >13,000 clinically diagnosed patients in Hubei Province on February 12, 2020 (as clearly indicated by a sudden increase in deaths) (Fig. 1B). Another uncertainty might result from those unidentified COVID-19 deaths that occurred in the early phase of the outbreak. We applied the Monte Carlo method (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Information online) to estimate such uncertainty assuming that the relative uncertainty of the reported numbers of deaths follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 2.5%. The potential total numbers of COVID-19 deaths were estimated to be 3,260 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3187\u20133394) in China; 110 (95% CI, 109\u2013112) in Hubei Province; 3,174 (95% CI, 3095\u20133270) outside Hubei; 2,550 (95% CI, 2494\u20132621) in Wuhan City; and 617 (95% CI, 607\u2013632) outside Wuhan (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. 1 online).

Modeling studies on the COVID-19 outbreak have been performed,6 and COVID-19 deaths have been estimated by other groups using different models. For example, using a data-driven analysis, Li et al7 recently predicted that total deaths in Hubei would be 2,250, much lower than the observed number, 2,761 (as of February 29). Using the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered\u2013dead model, Anastassopoulou et al8 predicted that total deaths might exceed 7,000 by February 29, but this number was much higher than the actual figure reported.",

The real data from January 21 to different closing dates were arbitrarily analyzed (colored lines), and the potential total numbers of deaths under these analyses are shown in insets. Real data (\u25cb) from March 1 to 19 agree well with the predicted data (dotted red lines) that were derived from the real data (\u25aa) from January 21 to February 29.",
