Recent Findings Heart retransplantation is associated with inferior short-term and long-term survival when compared with primary heart transplantation and its use remains controversial although less so in the pediatric heart transplant population. Summary In the most recent era of heart transplantation, patients retransplanted for CAV, greater than 1 year from their primary transplant, and who are not in critical condition have improved survival compared with other retransplant recipients. Survival with retransplantation can approach that of primary transplantation when patients are appropriately selected. More research is needed regarding the optimal timing for retransplantation and the optimal management for patients after retransplantation.",

            "text": "Various donor and recipient factors play a role in the inferior outcomes seen with retransplantation. An analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the USA between 2000 and 2005 observed 364 heart retransplants performed accounting for 2.9% of all adult heart transplants. Similar to ISHLT registry data, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year unadjusted graft survival was lower in retransplants compared with first transplants (82% vs. 86%, 70% vs. 80%, and 58% vs. 73% respectively, p < 0.0001). However, when adjusting for donor and recipient factors, the relative risk for graft loss with retransplantation was not significantly different from first heart transplantation. Recipient factors adjusted for included age, diagnosis, medical condition, creatinine, ventilator status, and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) suggesting that retransplant recipients tend to be more critically ill with more comorbidities. Donor factors adjusted for included age, cause of death, and cold ischemic time [7, 8] There are inherent challenges to risk stratification of recipients of cardiac retransplantation but it remains an important topic of discussion given the overall shortage of donor organs and reduced survival compared with first-time transplant. Risk factors for increased mortality after retransplant include short inter-transplantation interval; transplant center volume; use of a ventricular assist device (VAD), ECMO, or ventilator; ICU status; and older recipient age [3] . Similar risk factors were identified in an analysis of the UNOS registry as well as long ischemic time [9] . The ISHLT registry did not identify recipient age as a significant predictor for survival after retransplantation [2\u2022] but did find that younger donor age (11 to 39 years) was associated with improved median survival in retransplantation [2\u2022] . Retransplantation within the first year after primary heart transplant is associated with lower 1year survival compared with those who are retransplanted with a longer inter-transplant interval. The ISHLT registry data evaluating the cohort of heart retransplants between 2009 and 2016 found an inter-transplant interval of 1 year or less to be significantly associated with lower 1-year survival of 57.9% vs. 85% if the inter-transplant interval was greater than 1 year [1] . An analysis of the UNOS database from 1987 to 2011 identified 1,690 cardiac retransplants performed with 8.8% (n = 149) bridged with mechanical support, and of these 90 (60%) were supported by VAD, 54 (36%) by ECMO, and 5 (4%) by ECMO and VAD [10\u2022]. While survival was worse in this cohort compared with those not requiring mechanical support (1-year survival 48% in those bridged with MCS vs. 71% in those retransplanted without MCS), those bridged with ECMO had significantly worse survival than those bridged with VAD (1-year survival 40% with ECMO bridge vs. 53% with VAD bridge to retransplantation). The median survival was also significantly less with ECMO-bridged retransplants: 7.2 years in retransplants without MCS, 4.3 years in retransplants bridged with VAD, and 2 months in retransplants bridged with ECMO [10\u2022] . Notably, the majority of retransplants performed with MCS bridge (68%) were for graft failure within 1 year of initial heart transplant and thus reflect a sicker patient population. While ECMO use was associated with poor outcomes regardless of time from transplant and era of transplantation, those retransplants performed more than 1 year post-transplant with a VAD bridge had similar survival to retransplants performed without MCS bridge, and survival was also improved if the retransplant was performed between 2003 and 2011 (1-year survival 67%) vs. 1987 and 2002 (1-year survival 37%).",

Retransplantation for CAV has the best prognosis owing to greater 1-year survival of 74.7% [2\u2022] (Fig. 1) . Single-center experiences in large-volume centers have also shown favorable outcomes with retransplantation when the cohort of recipients was less critically ill prior to retransplantation and the majority were transplanted for CAV [11] . Between 2006 and 2013, 820 adult heart retransplants were performed in the ISHLT registry: 391 (47.8%) were performed for CAV, 47 (5.8%) for primary graft failure, and 132 (16.2%) for rejection [2\u2022] . Those retransplanted for primary graft failure have poor 1-year survival of 54%; however, if they survive the first year, prognosis is comparable with other indications for retransplantation [2\u2022 ]. In addition to retransplantation for primary graft failure, another poor prognostic indicator that has been identified in other cohorts includes retransplantation for acute rejection, which likely reflects cardiac transplantation performed under urgent circumstances in critically ill immunosuppressed patients [12] as well as higher immune activation placing the retransplanted heart at increased risk of rejection. From the ISHLT registry, 1-year survival for those retransplanted for nonspecific graft failure is 62.7% and 66.9% for rejection [2\u2022] .

With regard to retransplant recipients who had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) with their first heart transplant, there is limited data regarding the risk of recurrent PTLD after retransplantation and it remains controversial given the risk of recurrent PTLD with reintroduction of higher levels of immunosuppression. This question was examined in an analysis of the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN)/ UNOS database evaluating the safety and efficacy of retransplanting specifically this cohort of patients [15] . Between 1997 and 2005, 69 solid organ transplant patients with a history of PTLD underwent retransplantation, and of these, only 6 were heart transplant patients. The majority (88%) developed PTLD within 3 years after the first transplant and the indications for retransplantation in this cohort were commonly acute or chronic rejection. Most waited more than 1 year from PTLD diagnosis to retransplantation. The majority of the entire solid organ retransplant cohort (85.6%) was alive after 2 years of follow-up with retransplantation with no reports of recurrent PTLD. However, this cohort was compromised predominantly of abdominal organ transplants (kidney and liver) and there was higher mortality seen after thoracic organ retransplantation. When looking at the cases of heart retransplantation, all six were pediatric patients with the majority under the age of 6 years of age. Most were retransplanted within 5 to 10 years of the initial transplant and two of the six died of cardiac causes post-retransplant at 2.5 years of follow-up [14] . Timing of retransplantation in relation to PTLD diagnosis and treatment is an important consideration and a waiting period of 2 years of remission prior to listing has been reported in case reports of favorable outcomes with retransplantation in the kidney transplant literature [16] .",

Other modifiable risk factors may include the use of younger donors (age \u2264 39) and avoiding a long ischemic time. While the use of mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to retransplantation has been associated with lower survival compared with retransplantation without MCS bridge, it is important to note that the majority of these patients studied were bridged with MCS due to early graft failure within 1 year post-primary transplant.
