Worldwide, sepsis has been estimated to annually affect 31.5 million individuals and cause 5.3 million deaths4. In the US alone, sepsis has an incidence of more than a million new cases per year and accounts for 20% of all admissions to intensive care units5,6. Injuries to the lungs and kidneys, in particular, are strong independent contributors to sepsis mortality7,8. Yet, despite advances in antibiotic therapy and intensive supportive care, sepsis remains the second leading cause of deaths in non-coronary intensive care units9, with an overall mortality rate of up to 30% and accounting for more than 50% of all hospital deaths10. The only FDA-approved anti-sepsis medicine, activated protein C (Xigris), was withdrawn from the market by Eli Lilly in 2011 due to limited efficacy and hemorrhagic complications11. As a result, no approved effective anti-sepsis pharmacotherapy is available for use in septic patients.",

            "text": "Septic organ failure develops, in large part, due to low oxygen delivery associated with the hypoperfusion caused by vasomotor dysfunction, ventricular dysfunction, and enhanced adrenergic tone12. The septic stress not only disrupts crucial cellular and tissue functions, but also exacerbates endoplasmic reticulum stress and leads to the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules and inflammatory mediators, which cause leukocyte and vascular endothelial cell (EC) activation, increased capillary permeability, neutrophil infiltration, and tissue injury12,13. Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) is a highly conserved RNA-binding nuclear protein that is upregulated by hypoxia, mild hypothermia, and oxidative stress14\u201316. In these conditions, which typically occur during sepsis and shock, CIRP migrates from the nucleus to cytoplasmic stress granules, where it acts as a translational regulator for the messenger RNAs of numerous genes16,17. We have discovered that, during sepsis and shock, CIRP not only translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but it is also subsequently released into the circulation18. Once released, CIRP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) to increase sepsis severity and mortality rate18,19. Furthermore, we have also shown that healthy mice injected with CIRP undergo lung vascular endothelial cell (EC) activation, inflammasome activation, and pyroptosis to develop a sepsis-like form of acute lung injury (ALI)20. EC activation leads to a loss of endothelial barrier function, increased leukocyte adhesion, a procoagulation state, and vasodilation which, in turn, promote edema, leukocyte infiltration, microcirculatory abnormalities, and distributive shock, all of which aggravate sepsis severity21. Furthermore, we have shown that CIRP plays a key role in acute kidney injury (AKI) after renal ischemia and reperfusion22. These observations suggest CIRP may be a critical mediator for the development of sepsis-associated organ injury.",

C23\u2019s affinity for the TLR4-MD2 receptor complex is one order of magnitude higher than that of CIRP, and two orders of magnitude higher than those of LPS and HMGB123,24. As such, we hypothesized that, by blocking the interaction of extracellular CIRP with its receptor, treatment with C23 should decrease the activation of leukocytes and EC and, thus, attenuate sepsis severity and mortality. Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine the effects of C23 on inflammation and tissue injury in a mouse model of abdominal polymicrobial sepsis.",

Immediately after surgery, animals received a subcutaneous injection of 1 ml normal saline. After recovery from anesthesia, mice were returned to their cages. Mice were not treated with opioids to avoid lowering their respiratory drive, were not treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid acute kidney injury and digestive tract ulcers. Antibiotics were not used in order for the mice to develop severe sepsis with early mortality. At 20 h after CLP, mice were euthanized for blood and tissue collection.

Compared with sham-operated mice, the kidneys of vehicle-treated CLP mice expressed significantly higher levels of e-selectin and ICAM-1 (31.2- and 22.5-fold, respectively) (Fig. 5). Conversely, C23-treated mice expressed significantly less E-selectin (53% less), and had a trend towards also expressing less ICAM-1 (27% less) compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5). These results suggest that C23 reduces EC activation during sepsis.",

After screening 32 oligopeptides (15-mers) covering the entire sequence of human CIRP for their affinities for the TLR4/MD2 complex, we identified C23 as a potential CIRP antagonist18. C23\u2019s affinity for the TLR4/MD2 complex was one order of magnitude higher than that of CIRP, and two orders of magnitude higher than that of LPS or HMGB129. Indeed, pre-incubation with C23 prevented rmCIRP-induced release of TNF-\u03b1 from the human monocyte THP-1 cell line18, confirming that C23 is able to inhibit CIRP\u2019s activity. We here showed that C23 inhibits CIRP-induced TNF-\u03b1 release (dose-dependently), I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. These results further support C23 ability to suppress extracellular CIRP-induced inflammation. These observations, along with the decreased severity and improved survival rate in septic mice treated with C23, suggest that targeting extracellular CIRP is a rational and feasible approach to treat septic patients.",

We chose to measure LDH, ALT, and IL-6, in particular because their serum levels are indicators of sepsis severity and mortality44,45. We also elected to investigate changes in lung tissue histology and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines because they are crucially altered in sepsis-associated ALI46,47, and recapitulated by injection of CIRP into healthy mice20. In sepsis, EC apoptosis is increased and thought to contribute to lung injury48,49. We observed a reduced number of TUNEL-positive cells in the lungs of septic mice treated with C23. While intracellular expression of CIRP has been associated with cell survival50\u201353, we have correlated extracellular levels of CIRP with increased apoptosis in preclinical models of ALI, AKI, and hepatic ischemia and reperfusion13,20,22,42. The exact mechanism by which extracellular CIRP\u2019s leads to apoptosis is poorly understood, although the DNA fragmentation detected using TUNEL may instead reflect pyroptosis, which is induced by extracellular CIRP via Nlrp3 inflammasome20. In fact, C23 attenuation of the inflammasome may have also directly contributed to lower serum and tissue levels of IL-1\u03b220. In this study, C23 also decreased the levels of creatinine, BUN, NGAL, and KIM-1, all of which are increased during sepsis-associated AKI54\u201357. Considering the similarities between AKI caused by sepsis and ischemia and reperfusion, the beneficial effect of CIRP inhibition with C23 on sepsis-induced AKI is supported by our previous study that showed decreased AKI after renal ischemia and reperfusion in rats treated with CIRP-neutralizing antibodies and in CIRP-deficient mice22. Finally, we previously showed that CIRP causes EC activation and dysfunction20. Accordingly, in this study we observed lower expression of EC activation markers in the kidneys of mice treated with C23, corroborating our previous studies and indicating an important mechanism through which this peptide is able to attenuate sepsis severity.",

Although it is conceivable that C23 might also displace the binding of other TLR4 agonists, we have not been able to inhibit the release of TNF-\u03b1 after stimulation with LPS or HMGB1, suggesting that C23 binds to CIRP-specific binding sites in the TLR4-MD2 complex. Indeed, a computational modeling suggests that C23 displaces CIRP by docking into an MD2 pocket that is not a binding site for LPS (unpublished observations; W.-L. Yang and P. Wang). C23\u2019s specificity for CIRP may be a pharmacological advantage, as TLR4 is a major player in the phagocytosis and clearance of bacterial pathogens58\u201360.

Therefore, in this study, we administered C23 at two h after CLP. Since elevated serum levels of CIRP are detected in septic patients within 24 h of admission to the intensive care unit19, administration of C23 at later, more clinically achievable time points (such as co-administration with the first dose of antibiotics) may also prove to be effective. C23\u2019s half-life in the circulation is not known but, as an oligopeptide, it is expected to be short. Thus, it is possible that C23\u2019s efficacy can be further increased by its administration in higher doses or by continuous infusion. Nonetheless, we here show that a single administration of C23 early in the course of sepsis is sufficient to generate enduring beneficial effects, as reflected by the survival study.

TUNEL-positive cells were not further characterized and, therefore, we cannot determine their cell type or whether these cells are apoptotic or necroptotic.
