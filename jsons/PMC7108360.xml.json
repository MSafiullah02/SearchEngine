The World Health Organization (WHO) helps laboratories all over the world to develop laboratory capability and a global reference network which was initiated and coordinated by WHO has assisted in the provision and evaluation of diagnostic tools for detection of SARS-CoV (WHO, 2004a, WHO, 2004b). Since the initial epidemic that started in November 2002 in south\u2013east China and spread globally in 2003, at least three separate laboratory infection incidents have occurred with some secondary cases, demonstrating the need for constant vigilance and reliable diagnostic tools (WHO, 2004c; Heymann et al., 2004).",

Significant variation is found in the virus load in different patients and clinical samples, which may relate to the severity of the disease, timing and quality of sampling (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b). As a consequence, with current knowledge, a negative RT-PCR result cannot be interpreted to exclude SARS-CoV infection. The detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV is therefore currently a gold standard for confirmation of SARS infection (Wu et al., 2004). Serological assays based on fixed infected cells using immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or SARS-CoV virus specific enzyme immunoassays (EIA) have been developed in many different laboratories worldwide.",
