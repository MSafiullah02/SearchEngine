As a result, we remain without a licensed therapy for this disabling disease.1 No such large phase 3 studies have been reported in 2015, and we await results of major trials of inhaled antibiotics, which are due to be reported in 2016. Nevertheless, 2015 could mark the beginning of a revolution in our understanding of bronchiectasis; a series of high-quality studies and international programmes have started to unravel the complex pathophysiology of the disease and to lay the foundation for clinical breakthroughs.",

One of these is Szymanski and colleagues' whole-exome sequencing study3 of 69 patients with pulmonary NTM infection and bronchiectasis, and 18 of their unaffected family members. The investigators reported a high frequency of mitral valve prolapse, pectus excavatum, and joint hypermobility in these patients, and that these features were associated with several immune genes (eg, STAT1, IRF8, CARD9, CLEC4D, and MPEG1) and cilia genes, and with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This finding suggests that NTM-associated bronchiectasis might have a characteristic morphology and genetic susceptibility, but large studies in diverse populations are needed.3\n",

Unfortunately, unlike cystic fibrosis, for which forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is an accepted trial endpoint, FEV1 is poorly responsive to treatment in bronchiectasis. Lung clearance index (LCI), a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity in the peripheral airways, is potentially a more sensitive and responsive measure than FEV1, but further assessment is needed. In Grillo and colleagues' study7 of 32 stable and 32 exacerbating patients with bronchiectasis, LCI was reproducible across visits but did not change significantly with exacerbation or short-term treatments.",
