Understanding the origins of asthma inception and risk factors for severity of disease can potentially help elucidate modes of early intervention that could alter the disease course, with an aim at primary prevention. The majority of children with a history of asthma and impaired lung function at school age have a history of recurrent wheezing illnesses in early life (1) (2) (3) . Additionally, throughout childhood and beyond, viral illnesses are the most common triggers of asthma exacerbations (4) . The timing of early-onset wheezing with common viral infections has raised significant interest in the role of infections in childhood asthma inception. Furthermore, studies using molecular diagnostics suggest that the airway microbiome may be involved in complex infectious relationships that may be altering the disease course of both chronic asthma and associated exacerbations. Host factors such as allergic sensitization, antiviral immune responses, and environmental exposures are additionally thought to modify these relationships (3, (5) (6) (7) (8) .

Improvements in molecular diagnostic techniques, through the advent of PCR, have enhanced our ability to recognize novel species and types of viruses previously undocumented or underestimated in the wheezing patient (Table 1) . While respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) had long been recognized as a cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants, particularly during the winter season, human rhinovirus (HRV) has been detected in more than 60% of asthma exacerbations, making it a common culprit throughout the year (9) . The previously difficult to culture HRV-C species has now been identified, with data indicating that this particular virus may be intrinsically more virulent and likely to incite wheezing (10) .

HRVs are non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses from the Picornaviridae family of viruses. Based upon sequence homology, three distinct species of HRV have been identified: HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C. HRV-A is composed of >70 types and HRV-B with >25 types. More recently, a 3rd distinct group of HRV-C has been identified, with a rapidly expanding number of distinct serotypes. This particular species has proven difficult to grow in traditional culture, making their initial detection elusive. HRV-C has been identified frequently from patients hospitalized for fever, respiratory illness, and asthma exacerbations (10) . Children hospitalized with HRV infection tend to be older with a prior history of wheezing, as well as a personal history of atopy (18) . The omnipresent nature of HRV infections throughout the year can be further categorized via species analysis. Data have shown peak incidence of HRV-C types in the fall, timing that correlates with increased asthma exacerbations and hospitalization rates and with increased HRV-A detection during the spring (10, 19) . There is a relatively low level of HRV-B burden throughout the year (10) . The broad spectrum of illness generated by HRV infections, from asymptomatic to severe respiratory compromise necessitating hospitalization, strongly suggests that host factors modify the impact of infection.

They found that while prior to 6 months of age, RSV was the most commonly isolated viral pathogen, and from 6 months onward, HRV was most prevalent in wheezing children. The risk for asthma development by school age was 49 greater in the HRV-infected group than for children hospitalized with other respiratory viral illnesses (21) . Kusel et al. demonstrated, in a high-risk birth cohort, an association between outpatient wheezing with HRV in infancy and persistent wheezing at 5 yrs of age, particularly for children with early allergic sensitization (3).

Several studies have demonstrated that RSV-related severe LRTIs, particularly those requiring hospitalization, are associated with an increased risk of asthma diagnosis at school age (28, 29) . A prospective cohort study conducted in Sweden by Sigurs and associates (28, 30) used a case-control design to compare 47 hospitalized infants with documented RSV infection in infancy to 97 healthy controls, measuring rates of asthma and allergic sensitization over time. By the 18-yr follow-up, they found a higher percentage of both current asthma diagnosis (39% vs. 9%, p < 0.001) and allergic sensitization (41% vs. 14%, p = 0.005) in the RSV group than in the control (30) . Using a multivariate analysis approach, RSV infection was found to be the major risk factor in subsequent asthma development (OR 7.2). They concluded that severe early RSV bronchiolitis was associated with increased prevalence and persistence of allergic asthma into early adulthood. The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS) reported persisting respiratory symptoms (wheeze) through early adolescence in subjects who experienced outpatient RSV LRTI during the first 3 yrs of life. Interestingly, the association to wheeze diminished with age and lost significance by 13 yrs of age (29) . The Tennessee Asthma Bronchiolitis Study (TABS), a large unselected population-based retrospective study of children identified through a Medicaid database, investigated the relationship between winter virus infection and asthma (31, 32) .

Children and adults with allergic asthma have been reported to have reductions in peripheral blood mononuclear cell production of types I and III interferons in response to influenza and HRV infection (62, 63) . These abnormalities are associated with expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and are accentuated by FceRI cross-linking. Additionally, epithelial cell antiviral responses have been reported to be abnormal in patients with allergic asthma (8, 64) , although not all groups have been able to replicate these findings (65) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 311, "text": "(62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 312, "end": 315, "text": "63)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "(8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "64)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "text": "(65)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host factors and asthma development Immunologic factors"}, {"text": "Other potential pathways that may enhance HRV susceptibility in allergic individuals involve the effects of allergic inflammation on the airway leading to enhanced airway responsiveness, impaired barrier function, and increased mucous secretion (66) .

Finally, HRV can directly lead to a number of airway changes critical to asthma development. Leigh and colleagues looked at the response of airway epithelial cells following infection with HRV and noted an overall up-regulation of several growth factors important in airway remodeling including amphiregulin, activin A, and VEGF (68).
