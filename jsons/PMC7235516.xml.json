Those analyzing risks for either a pandemic or a process safety incident must envision/describe scenarios related to a specific hazard(s). Risk is a function of the magnitude of the impact and the likelihood of occurrence of the event. If the risk is deemed to be above the risk tolerance threshold, action is required to reduce the risk. Once scenarios (cause\u2010consequence pairs) are developed, planners must decide which scenarios are credible events and further, which scenarios carry a risk. If the risk\u2010tolerance threshold is exceeded, risk\u2010based decisions must be made to implement appropriate safeguards including both (a) preventive safeguards to reduce the probability of a loss of containment/control incident and (b) mitigative safeguards to reduce the consequences should loss of containment/control occur.",

A global study (conducted under the auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Medicine) was completed shortly before the 100\u2010year commemoration of the 1918 pandemic.\n5\n The study concluded that although there are enormous uncertainties in modeling the risks of infectious disease crises, the case for more action is compelling no matter how the risks are calculated.
