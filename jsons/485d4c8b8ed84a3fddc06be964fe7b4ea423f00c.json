            "text": "Existing compartmental mathematical modelling methods for epidemics, such as SEIR models, cannot accurately represent effects of testing, contact tracing and isolation. This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent-or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computationally efficiency is such that it be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "Mathematical modelling has figured prominently in decision making around control and containment of Covid-19 spread, including the imposition of physical distancing measures [2] . It provides a logical framework for understanding the propagation of an May 14, 2020 1/23 infectious disease through a population and allows different interventions to be explored, including testing and contact tracing of infected individuals as possible strategies to ease social distancing restrictions. Such models are also necessarily simplifications and understanding of their assumptions and what they do and do not represent is required to correctly interpret them. Mathematical models have a long history of being used to describe the spread of infectious diseases from plague outbreaks more than a century ago [3] to the more recent SARS [4] and Ebola [5] , [6] epidemics, and from making decisions around different vaccination strategies for influenza [7] to modelling HIV [8] , and from modelling pandemic influenza [9] to currently facilitating real-time policy decision making around the COVID-19 epidemic [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . There are several common approaches, each with advantages and disadvantages [4, 15] . Compartmental models [4, 16, 17] partition the population into different compartments such as susceptible, exposed to the virus but not infectious, infectious and removed and track the movements of individuals between these groups. Though dynamics of real disease outbreaks are fundamentally stochastic [18] [19] [20] , this level detail is mainly relevant for early stages or small outbreaks [21] . Commonly within compartmental models a mean-field approximation given by ordinary differential equations (ODE) is used [4, 22, 23] . The latter approach is particularly attractive because it is computationally efficient and can yield informative results. ODE systems can be generalised to explicitly incorporate dependence on system state at some times in the past, yielding delay-differential equations (DDE) [24] [25] [26] , the analogue for continuous state of Markov processes with finite memory. Such formulations require meticulous care to solve accurately [27, 28] and much of what is known about their behaviour consists of asymptotic results [29] [30] [31] [32] . Branching processes are used [23, 33, 34] where more flexibility is desired in representing the timing of transitions among compartments and, for continuous time, are amenable to stochastic differential equation (SDE) treatment. For some choices of distribution, the SDE formulation is Markovian and can be analysed as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) [19, 35] . Finally, individual-or agent-based models (IBM/ABM) explicitly represent each individual in the population and allow for fine-grained modelling of the characteristics of each one such as different contact patterns or susceptibilities to the disease [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . They have been [41] , and are being [10] [11] [12] widely used for planning and epidemic control. While ABMs allow for maximal flexibility and realism, this comes at a high computational cost and it can be difficult to extract analytical results that relate the fine-grained behaviour to population-level effects. It is generally feasible to conduct agent-based simulations for populations of tens of thousands, but there are salient features of epidemics such as the timing and size of peaks of infectious individuals that depend on population sizes two orders of magnitude larger. An important subset of ABMs are network or graphical models [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] where the structure of the population, the possible interactions among its members, are explicitly represented. In addition to the computational cost and analytical difficulties with ABMs, sufficient data to support their fine-grained realism is rarely available. For many purposes, including the one that we are concerned with here, an accurate qualitative understanding of the effect of interventions like testing and contact tracing, cheap, coarse, high-level models are more useful than expensive fine-grained models that rely on vast often not readily available data.",

            "text": "While classic compartmental models can easily be used to simulate some interventions analogous to parameter changes, they cannot readily include effects contact tracing of infected individuals unless vast assumptions are made. This is because modelling contact-tracing is intrinsically reliant on individual behaviour within a network structure. Previous work on Ebola [6] , SARS [48] and covid-19 used simple approaches to represent contact tracing in a compartmental model: asserting that a constant fraction of exposed individuals becomes isolated due to contact tracing [10, 14, 49, 50] or reducing transmission May 14, 2020 2/23 by a constant amount, perhaps after a delay [51] . We believe that this kind of approach is insufficient for the purpose of understanding how the rate and timing of testing and contact tracing affect success in containing outbreaks. The purpose of contact tracing is to attempt to isolate infectious, or soon to be infectious individuals. Therefore, contact tracing should result in the isolation of both infectious and exposed individuals and this is a key assumption that previous work has missed. Contact tracing will also inevitably result in the isolation of susceptible and recovered individuals with the former contributing to a reduced rate of disease propagation. To properly understand this process it is imperative to model the effects of contact tracing with mathematical rigour. In this paper we develop an extension to the classic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed 1 (SEIR) model [16, 52, 53] simulated with ODEs to include testing, contacttracing, and isolation (TTI) strategies. We call this model SEIR-TTI. This model captures the salient features of the manifestation at the population level of the dynamics of testing and tracing at the individual level. Due to its relative simplicity, SEIR-TTI is applicable across a spectrum of diseases. With appropriate parametrisation, it can be used anywhere a standard SEIR model can be used with the same caveats and limitations.",

These results, and those in the following section, use the system of differential equations as described in detail in the Methods. We choose a relatively large initial number of infectious individuals merely for illustrative purposes as it renders the dynamics clearerthe more aggressive testing regimes would result in immediate containment of a small outbreak which would be difficult to see whereas a large outbreak nevertheless takes some time to contain. The parameters have the usual meaning, with values fixed for the purposes of this section: N = 6.7 \u00d7 10 7 individuals is the total population, I(0) = 10 5 is the initial number of infected individuals,\u03b2 = 0.033 infections/contact is the probability of transmission; c = 13 contacts/day is the contact rate, \u03b1 = 0.2 days \u22121 is the incubation rate, the rate of leaving the exposed state and becoming infectious; and \u03b3 = 7 \u22121 days \u22121 is the rate of recovery, or leaving the infectious state. These values result in a basic reproduction number of R 0 = 3. In the simplest case, testing is conducted at random at some rate \u03b8 of tests per individual per day and only infectious individuals are tested and immediately isolated. Representative trajectories from this system for various values of \u03b8 are shown in Fig 2. The upper panel shows the time-series for total infections, exposed and infectious, and the lower panel shows the effective reproductive number, R(t). We can observe that while testing the entire population every 20 days (\u03b8 = 0.05) results in a lower maximum total number of infections, we require very frequent testing, every 3-4 days (\u03b8 = 0.3, .25) in order to control an outbreak and cross the R(t) = 1 threshold (red horizontal line). It is straightforward to work out the condition under which testing crosses this threshold by analysing the fixed points in the underlying system of differential equations since the required condition is that there is no change in the number of infectious people as they each infect one other on average and then are removed. Some arithmetic yields \u03b8 crit =\u03b2c \u2212 \u03b3, the red line in Fig 3. The above shows that, whilst testing and isolating alone can be sufficient to control an outbreak, it would take a herculean effort on its own. Without any form of distancing May 14, 2020 4/23 .

Individuals who test positive are isolated for the duration of their illness. The top plot shows the total infections (exposed and infectious individuals) over time for various testing rates ranging from none, \u03b8 = 0, to testing all infectious individuals every two days, \u03b8 = 0.55. The bottom plot shows the reproduction number over time for these same scenarios. Observe that even fairly frequent testing, e.g every five days, \u03b8 = 0.2, this is only sufficient to reduce peak infections by one order of magnitude from about 20 million to about two million. In the infrequent testing regimes, \u03b8 \u2208 [0.05, 0.25], we can also observe that the curve described by R(t) is not a sigmoid but instead first falls to a value above R(t) = 1 before stabilising and then falling again. This is because though testing and isolating does have an effect at those rates, it is not sufficiently frequent to identify all of those who are infectious. May 14, 2020 5/23",

The effects of contact tracing is shown in Fig 4. The scenario is the same as with testing alone, except that the testing rate is fixed at \u03b8 = 14 \u22121 days \u22121 and the tracing rate is fixed at \u03c7 = 2 \u22121 days \u22121 . The interpretation is that, on average, an infectious individual expect to be tested in 7 days and contacts can expect to be traced in 2 days. The choice of these values for illustrative purposes is purposeful. Recall from the previous section that \u03b3, the recovery rate is fixed at 7 \u22121 days \u22121 . One would expect that testing and isolating individuals, on average, after they have recovered and it is too late would be insufficient to contain an outbreak. Indeed it is not suffcient, but it does reduce the maximum number of infected individuals somewhat. However, since tracing happens as a consequence of testing, it amplifies its effectiveness. This can be seen in the figure where even a modest tracing success rate of 30-40% results in a substantial reduction of more than half the peak infections. May 14, 2020 6/23",

When \u03b8 is very small, meaning very little testing, then contact tracing has little effect. This is unsurprising because testing causes tracing. When there is very frequent testing, on the other hand, there is little benefit to contact tracing. When testing happens more frequently on average than an individual can infect another, it is sufficient to control the outbreak on its own. However for intermediate values, contact tracing amplifies the effectiveness of testing. The above result can be seen from this plot as well: when testing of infectious individuals is expected in a week, a modest 40% success rate at tracing contacts in two days is enough to reduce the reproduction number from 2 to less than 1.5, a substantial benefit.",

Proportionally, that is 14.3 infections in a population of 10 thousand. There is a non-negligible probability that an outbreak of size 14 will die out on its own. This will be accounted for by the ABM but is not a realistic possibility for an outbreak of 100 thousand. Scaling therefore suggests fundamentally different results.

In addition, let us define Pr(C I ) the probability of an individual of having had contact with an infectious individual in the past where that infectious individual is still infectious. The latter detail is important because here we consider only \"next-generation\" tracing; in other words, we only try to trace the direct contacts of those infectious individuals who were found to test positive. This is a conservative assumption. It could be possible to make contact tracing more effective by also tracing one generation further (the contacts of the contacts), but because the process requires exponentially more resources with each generation with decreasing likelihood of correctly identifying exposed or infectious individuals, we simply opt to neglect that possibility. Therefore, in this model the only people who can be traced are those whose most recent infectious contact is still infectious; once they recover, they can not be identified as infectious any more, and thus it will be impossible to trace their contacts as well.

We also used F I , meaning the survival function of the total number of infectious individuals, I = I U + I D , because here we focus on overall infectiousness, not the fact that one might have been isolated before recovery. Note, however, that only I U individuals participate in contacts. The reason that this is an approximation is that we're not excluding the N (C I |S U ) from the pool of S U that can be contacted, and thus there is a risk of double counting. That risk will remain negligible as long as N (C I |S U )/S U is small; therefore, this model will perform better in a regime in which there are few infectious individuals, and thus, few contacts. This is in fact the regime in which contact tracing is most likely to be feasible in practice, to control small outbreaks rather than in presence of an uncontrolled epidemic. Regardless, we show in the Results section that even when this approximation does not hold, while it results in oscillatory behaviour early on, it still generally adequately describes the overall trends and long term equilibrium.

Given the similarities between these equations and the ones describing the compartment models, it is natural to think of creating a specific compartment for N (C I |S U ). This is in fact what we do. There is, however, an important difference from regular compartments, because this compartment does not include individuals that exclusively belong to it; rather, it overlaps with S U . It is more of a device used for book-keeping purposes, to compute the integral in Equation 21 within the confines of the model, than a compartment in the usual sense. We similarly define N (C I |E U ), N (C I |I U ) and N (C I |R U ), which leads, using Equation 1, to the following contact tracing rates,",

We justify this choice by the following reasoning. In a weak testing regime (\u03b7 \u03b8\u03c7 \u03b3), N (C I |X U )/X U might be high due to a great number of infected individuals, but in principle should never be greater than 1 (modulo the point above about double counting). Therefore, the hazard function is dominated by \u03b3. Conversely, in a strong testing regime, the number of infected individuals, and thus N (C I |X U )/X U , will be very small, and this assumption will at most end up underestimating the effect of contact tracing (by causing a faster decay in N (C I |X U ) than otherwise would happen). The examples shown in the Results section illustrate how this affects the simulations -in general, leading to good predictions for the behaviour of the E U and I U compartments.",

This has been until now only done with agent-based models. An important aspect of our approach is that our ODE formulation explains the behaviour of the agent-based model. Namely, agent-based models are formulated in terms of local interactions among individuals and exhibit emergent behaviour at the population level. For interesting agent-based models, it is usually difficult to obtain any explicit connection between the local interactions and the population-level dynamics except through simulation and inspection of the results. We argue that our work here shows such an explicit connection: we have been able to capture the dynamics that arise at a population level from testing and contact tracing. We show that this is correct by demonstrating good agreement with the population-level dynamics that emerge from the agent-based formulation where only local interactions are specified.",

If making policy decisions without evidence is flying blindly, making decisions without understanding the consequences of the various control measures is flying without flight controls. Models like SEIR-TTI can inform policymakers of the role that testing and tracing can play in preventing the spread of disease. Combined with economic and policy analysis, this can enable far better decision making both in the immediate future, and in the longer term.
