SVA is a single-stranded, positive-sense, non-enveloped RNA virus with an approximately 7.2 kb genome [1]. This virus was first discovered as a contaminant in 2001 (and named Seneca Valley virus 001 [SVV-001]) while cultivating viral vectors in the PER.C6 cell line [2], [3]. While, SVA was isolated in previous cases collected from various pig farms in the USA from 1988 to 2001 [4]. One polyprotein of SVA is post-translationally processed by virus-encoded proteases into 4 structural (VP1-4) and 7 non-structural (2A-2C, 3A-3D) proteins [2], [5], among which VP1 is considered to be the most immunogenic protein in the family Picornaviridae [6], [7].",

Infected breeding herds had an increase of neonatal morbidity and mortality ranging from 30% to 70%, mainly piglets less than 7-day-old [8], [9]. The clinical symptoms of SVA resembles foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease, vesicular exanthema of swine, and vesicular stomatitis, which are four vesicular diseases [10]. SVA was also found in lesions in pigs suffering from porcine idiopathic vesicular disease in Canada and USA in 2008 and 2012, respectively [11]. In 2014 and 2015, SVA infection was associated with outbreaks of vesicular disease in sows as well as neonatal pig mortality in Brazil and USA [12]. In China, SVA (SVV CH-01-2015) was also first isolated in a pig farm in 2015 [13].",

However, the usage of various codons to code amino acids is not random and some are used more often, which is known as codon usage bias [14]. Codon usage bias has been reported for some RNA viruses, but the rate can vary depending on the identity of the virus. For instance, rubella and rotavirus have strong codon usage bias, whereas porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have weak codon usage bias [15], [16]. Natural selection, gene length, mutation pressure, abundance of tRNAs and RNA structure all affect codon usage bias. The relation of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is expected to affect viral survival, fitness, evasion from the host immune system and evolution [17].",

It was calculated using the following equation:RSCU=gij\u2211jnigijniwhere gij is the observed number of codons for the amino acid, which has ni kinds of synonymous codons. A higher RSCU value indicates a stronger codon usage bias. It's considered that codon is used equally when RSCU value is 1.0; if RSCU is more than 1.0, the codon usage bias is positive; if it is less than 1.0, the codon usage bias is considered to be negative. In addition, codons with RSCU values \u2265 1.6 are over-represented, and codons with RSCU values \u2264 0.6 are under-represented [19]. EMBOSS: cusp was used for the RSCU analysis.

The Fi values were calculated using the formula below:((F)i=n\u2211j=1i(njn)2\u22121n\u22121)where n is the total number of frequencies of the codons for that amino acid and nj is the total number of frequencies of the codon for that amino acid. In contrast to the RSCU, a lower ENC value indicates a higher codon usage bias. Normally, the ENC values range from 20 to 61 [21].If only one of the possible synonymous codons is used for the corresponding amino acid, the ENC is 20. While there is no codon usage bias, the ENC value is 61 [21]. Therefore, if the ENC is equal to or less than 35, the codon usage bias is considered extremely strong [20], [21].",

In this study, the synonymous codon usage of the SVA was analyzed to better understand the SVA evolution, especially the interplay between the viruses and the immune response [33]. In the analysis, the ENC and RSCU were calculated. The ENC ranged from 54.51 to 55.54 with a mean ENC 54.87, which indicates a low codon usage bias. This result is in accordance with other Picornaviridae viruses, such as poliovirus type A9 (ENC = 54.2), foot-and-mouth disease virus (mean ENC = 51.53), rhinovirus type 89 (ENC = 45.9), and enterovirue 71 (ENC = 56.6) [34]. The results of overall RSCU of all the codons which revealed that most of the preferentially used codons are G/C-ended codons, combined with the mean GC3s (56.6%) suggested that (G + C) compositions constrain the codon usage bias of the SAV. This discovery is in agreement with the previous reports that G + C contents are the dominant factors influencing the codon usage in virus genomes [35], [36].",

Normally, mutational pressure and natural selection are considered to be the main factors influencing the codon usage variation among genes. In this study, as shown in Fig. 1, all the strains are clustered together, and the observed ENC are just below the standard curve, revealing that mutational pressure affects the codon usage bias. Additionally, the PCA suggested that the different isolated strains were diverged from each other and did not locate on or around the origin\nof\ncoordinate, which also explained that there exists mutational pressure in shaping the codon usage pattern. Furthermore, the results were confirmed by the correlation analysis between the nucleotide content (A%, TU%, G%, C%, GC%) and the codon compositions (A3s, U3s, C3s, G3s, GC3s), which each other had significant differences and existed positively correlation. For natural selection, only the Aroma score was slightly correlated with the ENC, and other indicies had no correlation, demonstrated that natural selection plays a role in the codon usage bias of SVS.",

Thus, to determine which was responsible for the extreme codon usage bias in SVA, the GC12s and GC3s were plotted against the evolution time in an evolutional neutrality analysis, and the results revealed that the mutational pressure plays an increasing role in the SVA evolution compared with natural selection. In addition, the neutrality plot showed that the relationship between GC3s and GC12s was not significant, and the correlation coefficient indicated that compared with mutation pressure, natural selection is more important in codon usage bias of SVA. As shown in Fig. 2, the 23 strains isolated from different location or dates were separated, suggesting that the geographic distribution and date of isolation may contribute to the codon usage pattern of SVA. To confirm this hypothesis, the relationship between the date or location of isolation and the ENC were analyzed, respectively. The significant difference among ENC value and isolated country and year indicated that the geographical distribution and isolated year are essential to some extent.",
