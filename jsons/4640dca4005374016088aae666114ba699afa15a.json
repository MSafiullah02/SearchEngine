            "text": "Two months have passed since the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. In our editorial[1], we reported that until March 24 th a Covid-19 test by nasopharyngeal swab was offered to the patients presenting with symptoms of Covid-19. However, from April 2 nd we have changed that policy, offering two Covid-19 tests by nasopharyngeal swab to everyone undergoing thoracic surgery for malignancies before admission to our general university hospital, even if asymptomatic. Just in case both buffers were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 we admitted the patient. This measure may have improved the safety for patients and health givers. Moreover, during the period between the end of February and today (May 3 rd ), among the 203 patients admitted to our division for surgery, none developed Covid-19 except for one patient that presented with covid-19, 45 days after surgery and 39 after the discharge.
