Despite a 25% decrease in mortality since 2000, one child still dies of malaria every minute. The disease is caused by four species of protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium that are specific to humans, namely Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. A fifth species, Plasmodium knowlesi, which primarily infects monkeys, has also been recognized as a zoonotic cause of human malaria in Indonesia [2]. Of these species, P. falciparum is the most deadly. All are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles.",

This strategy eventually led to the emergence and widespread dissemination of drug-resistant parasites. Consequently, starting in the 1990s, new combination therapies in the form of ACTs were introduced. These consist of an artemisinin derivative, such as artesunate, artemether or dihydroartemisinin on the one hand, combined in a fixed dose with a 4-aminoquinoline, aryl methanol or a related derivative such as amodiaquine, lumefantrine (Coartem\u00ae, Norvatis, Switzerland), mefloquine, piperaquine (Euartesim\u00ae, MMV, Switzerland) or pyronaridine (Pyramax\u00ae, MMV) on the other. Currently, these ACTs are highly effective. However, ominous first signs of possible future resistance have begun to appear.",

Nonetheless, this has not led to the complete loss of this class of compound, because resistance is not coupled to the drug target itself.

The parasite also possesses an endogenous cytosolic Fe-superoxide dismutase and imports a host peroxiredoxin from the red blood cell into the parasite cytosol [15,16].

It was demonstrated that this drug can directly bind to the Fe(III) center of Fe(III)heme via a deprotonated hydroxyl group. Based on this structure as a model, molecular mechanics were used to support a hypothesis that the relative biological activities of the four isomers of quinine against P. falciparum could be accounted for on the basis of an additional interaction: a charge-assisted hydrogen bond between a protonated amine nitrogen atom in the side chain of the drug and one of the heme propionate groups. This interaction has recently been confirmed in crystal structures of quinine\u2013Fe(III)heme and quinidine\u2013Fe(III)heme (Figure 2B & 2C)\n[20].",

In addition, the precise relationship between heme binding and hemozoin inhibition remains unclear. Early postulates involved stoichiometric solution complexes of antimalarials with Fe(III)heme [30] and included suggestions that drugs act by increasing Fe(III)heme solubility, thus preventing aggregation [30,31]. More recently, however, an alternative suggestion by Buller et al. has enjoyed considerable attention [32]. These authors, among others, have suggested that this class of drug can dock into the fastest-growing face of the hemozoin crystal, as well as inhibit growth of some of the other faces [32\u201335]. This hypothesis has been able to mathematically account for the effects of chloroquine and quinidine on the kinetics of synthetic hemozoin (\u03b2-hematin) formation [36]. In addition, it can also explain how substoichiometric quantities of a drug can inhibit hemozoin formation and provides a well-defined binding site for these compounds. To date, however, this model does not appear to have been directly used to try to design new inhibitors using a rational approach, probably because conventional drug-docking programs are not able to handle crystal surfaces well.",

            "text": "Despite ample evidence that quinoline and related antimalarials inhibit \u03b2-hematin formation under abiotic and biomimetic conditions, direct evidence of inhibition of hemozoin formation in the parasite itself is much more sparse. Chloroquine and, more recently, ruthenoquine, an analog of the 4-aminoquinoline ferroquine in which the ferrocene moiety is replaced by ruthenocene, have been shown to accumulate in the parasite DV in close proximity to hemozoin [37,38]. Smaller hemozoin crystals and a premature halt in their growth within the parasite DV has been observed in the presence of chloroquine [39]. Finally, at 120 nM and 12-h incubation times, chloroquine causes a build-up of transport vesicles in the parasite, which contain undigested Hb [40], indicating that the endocytotic feeding process is inhibited. Recently, a fractionation strategy has been applied together with electron spectroscopic imaging to chloroquine-treated P. falciparum\n[41]. This has clearly shown a dose-dependent increase in free Fe(III)heme occurring together with the decrease in hemozoin. Undigested Hb only seems to appear at higher doses of chloroquine, and the levels of free Fe(III)heme are closely correlated with the parasite survival curve (Figure 3). Electron spectroscopic imaging using electron energy loss spectroscopy clearly showed a translocation of iron to the parasite cytoplasm (Figure 4A & 4B). Since virtually all of the iron present is heme iron and there is little undigested Hb at the dose used, this is likely to be the location of the free Fe(III)heme. There is also evidence that chloroquine causes a disruption in the growth of the hemozoin crystals, which show evidence of a mosaic structure with grain boundaries (Figure 4C). Thus, in combination with earlier work, this study provided strong evidence that chloroquine does indeed act by inhibiting hemozoin formation in the parasite. Preliminary evidence also showed an increase in free Fe(III)heme and a decrease in hemozoin at 2.5\u00d7 IC50 for a number of other drugs, including amodiaquine, mefloquine and lumefantrine, as well as artesunate. However, it must be emphasized that further work would be required to substantiate whether the observations made with these other drugs are causal or the effect of inhibiting other targets.",

Four studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s provided a detailed structure\u2013activity model for the 4-aminoquinolines [42\u201345]. This is summarized in Figure 5. Further studies have revealed that alterations to the alkyl side chain of the quinoline can abolish cross-resistance with chloroquine [46]. Indeed, the structure of the side chain appears to be the primary determinant of resistance, with the quinoline ring itself having, at most, a minor role in cross-resistance [47\u201349]. This has encouraged the design of new quinoline antimalarials with the aim of overcoming resistance.",

Rather, resistance arises from mutations and changes in expression levels of membrane proteins located in the DV membrane. The principal determinants of chloroquine resistance are mutant forms of a protein known as PfCRT [50,51]. A second protein, PfMDR1, has also been implicated in resistance to quinoline antimalarials [52,53]. Mutations in this protein are associated with mefloquine resistance in field isolates, and an increased copy number has previously been associated with decreased sensitivity to quinine. PfMDR1 is not thought to be directly responsible for chloroquine resistance, but mutant forms of this protein can affect chloroquine sensitivity in the presence of mutant forms of PfCRT [54], and there is evidence of a complex interaction between PfCRT and PfMDR1 [55]. In addition, PfMDR1 has recently been implicated in the transport of chloroquine and other quinolines into the parasite DV [56] and has subsequently also been shown to bind to a selection of these drugs [57]. Furthermore, evidence from a cross of two different drug-resistant strains (GB4 and 7G8) has indicated that quinolines actually inhibit transport of the natural substrates of PfCRT and PGH-1 (the protein encoded by PfMDR1) [58]. A third protein, PfMRP1, located in the parasite plasma membrane, has also been suggested to play a role in chloroquine resistance, but in this case, the evidence remains uncertain [59,60]. Notwithstanding the role of these other membrane proteins, a PfCRT mutation is accepted to be the major factor involved in chloroquine resistance.",

Chloroquine-resistant strains of the parasite exhibit several mutations in this protein (Figure 6)\n[62], but all naturally occurring chloroquine-resistant mutants exhibit one crucial mutation, that of Lys-76 to Thr-76 (K76T). The additional mutations to K76T are thought to counteract the loss of function that would occur in the case of the K76T mutation alone [63]. Studies conducted using Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with mRNA encoding PfCRT have convincingly shown that this protein transports chloroquine. These findings support the hypothesis that decreased activity of chloroquine stems from its extrusion by PfCRT from the DV. This effectively lowers the concentration of chloroquine in this organelle, thus permitting hemozoin formation to resume unhindered [64]. Chloroquine is also thought to bind to PfCRT, and a possible site of interaction has been proposed based on photoaffinity labeling [65]. Several recent and comprehensive reviews covering PfCRT and chloroquine resistance are available, and readers are encouraged to consult them for in-depth discussion [62,66\u201368].",

These include other calcium channel blockers, including analogs of verapamil and nifedipine; dibenzazepines and their analogs, which include imipramine; phenothiazines; dihydroanthracenes; dibenzylmethylamines (dibemethins); plant-derived alkaloids; and others, including primaquine [71].

The three prototype compounds (Compounds 8, 9 & 10) also had good in vivo antimalarial activity in the P. berghei mouse malaria model. Two of the compounds were curative when using three or four oral doses at 100 mg/kg, with parasites being undetectable 30 days after treatment and with 100% of the mice surviving. This series of compounds again illustrates the potential of the dual-function approach to chloroquine resistance-reversing antimalarially active compounds. In comparison with the initially reported reversed chloroquine compounds, the clogP values of this series were considerably lower (5.42\u20136.19) and were comparable to chloroquine (clogP = 5.1).

In addition, in at least one group, the dibemequines, inhibition of the transport of chloroquine by PfCRT in the Xenopus oocyte has been directly demonstrated. In a review, Peyton has also reported that similar activity has been observed, but not yet published in the case of the reversed chloroquines [82]. These compounds have been shown to exhibit strong in vitro antimalarial activity against a substantial number of chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant parasite strains, with no significant cross-resistance with chloroquine.

This can lead to prolonged QT intervals and potentially fatal heart arrhythmias [83]. Indeed, in the case of at least one antimalarial drug, halofantrine, this problem has actually been encountered clinically [84]. Unfortunately, hERG toxicity is difficult to predict with certainty. Nonetheless, Gleeson has carried out a principal components analysis of approximately 30,000 compounds for which absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity data had been collected at GlaxoSmithKline and found that while there is a greater potential for hERG liability in basic molecules than in acidic or neutral ones, the liability is generally much reduced if the compound has a molecular weight below 400 and a calculated cLogP below 4 [85]. Indeed, this also improves druggability in a number of other ways. For example, it improves solubility, permeability and volume of distribution, decreases protein binding and lowers the potential of the compound to inhibit cytochrome P450. As noted above, Peyton and coworkers have already produced reversed chloroquines with much improved cLogP values [77]. A dibemequine analog has also been produced with a cLogP well below 4 and a molecular weight below 400 [Egan TJ et al., Unpublished Data]. While it has not yet been demonstrated that any of these compounds actually have reduced hERG liability, it does at least suggest that improvement is possible with this class of compound.",

It is not currently known whether these compounds inhibit chloroquine transport competitively or noncompetitively. They could bring about inhibition either by themselves being transported in preference to chloroquine or by binding to PfCRT and blocking chloroquine transport. The latter seems more likely, since one would expect resistant parasites to be resistant to the dual-function molecule if it were transported out of the DV more efficiently than chloroquine. If used as monotherapies, these compounds might have an increased risk of rapid development of resistance because of their ability to bind to chloroquine-resistant mutants of PfCRT. It is possible that point mutations may then lead from binding to transport. This potential problem would likely be lessened by use of combination therapy. In addition, with the exception of one group of reversed chloroquines, the activities of these compounds against South American strains such as 7G8, with reduced sensitivity to verapamil resistance reversal, have not been explored. Lack of activity against such strains is potentially a risk factor for these compounds.",
