After binding to sialic acid receptors, influenza virions are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The low pH in the endosomes triggers the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, and the influx of H+ through the M2 channel releases the viral RNA genes in the cytoplasm (\u2018uncoating\u2019). Adamantane derivatives block this uncoating step. The RNA replication and transcription steps [which require repeated cycles of (\u2212)RNA \u2194 (+)RNA polymerization reactions] occur in the nucleus and can be blocked indirectly by inosine 5\u2032 monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase inhibitors (e.g. ribavirin), which suppress the biosynthesis of GTP, or directly by RNA polymerase inhibitors (e.g. T705). The translation of viral mRNA to proteins could be prevented by interferon and small interfering (si)RNAs. Packaging and budding of virions occur at the cytoplasmic membrane, and neuraminidase inhibitors block the release of newly formed virions from the infected cells [6].",

It should not be ignored, however, that the use of oseltamivir can lead to the development of resistance. Resistance to oseltamivir in clinical isolates of human influenza A has been associated with mutations at positions 119 (E119V), 152 (R152K), 198 (D198N), 274 (H274Y) and 292 (R292K) of the neuraminidase.

Combining oseltamivir with probenecid might be an important therapeutic option in severely ill patients and might enable the use of the standard dose (75 mg twice daily) of oseltamivir, as currently recommended. From studies of the highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/04 strain of H5N1 in mice [12], it could be inferred that a prolonged oseltamivir regimen (i.e. eight- or ten-day, rather than five-day, treatment) and a higher dose (150 mg, instead of 75 mg, twice daily) might be required for the most beneficial antiviral effect.

There is low systemic availability of zanamivir following administration, including low drug levels in the lower respiratory tract (where most of the replication of current H5N1 viruses seems to take place) [13]. However, zanamivir is active against the oseltamivir-resistant H5N1 H274Y variant. Although not yet demonstrated for avian influenza, neuraminidase-based resistance is more likely to develop against oseltamivir than against zanamivir [14]. Combination of the two drugs might be considered if it is further corroborated that the resistance patterns of zanamivir and oseltamivir do not overlap. If needed urgently (e.g. in severely ill patients), zanamivir and oseltamivir should be administered parenterally (i.e. intramuscularly or intravenously) and, hence, the adequate formulations should be made available for this purpose.",

First, the amino acid at position 627 in the viral polymerase protein PB2 is mutated from glutamic acid to lysine in H5N1 viruses, and this might represent an adaptation of H5N1 viruses for efficient replication in mammalian cells [42]. Second, the HA of H5N1 viruses contains an unusual stretch of basic amino acids (RRRKKRG) that is cleaved by ubiquitous intracellular proteases (including furin). Recombinant H5N1 viruses that lack these basic amino acids are not virulent in mice 40, 43. Third, the C-terminal domain of the non-structural protein NS1 of avian H5N1 viruses contains a sequence motif (ESEV/EPEV) that can be considered a virulence factor because it binds to human host proteins and disrupts their morphology and functioning [44]. In ferrets, however, the C-terminal sequence is not required for the virulence of H5N1 viruses [45]. Therefore, the role of the ESEV/EPEV motif and other molecular determinants of the virulence of H5N1 viruses must be explored further [41].",
