Currently, while widespread vaccination projects have been performed, the prevalence of these viruses remains high due to main antigen change and the emergence of new viruses. Immune serum containing viral antibodies can be used to prevent infection in susceptible animals. However, the method is not currently widely applied. Feline recombinant interferon-omega is effective in the treatment of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) [1] and FCoV [2] infection in cats and also inhibits viral replication of canine parvovirus [3]. It remains unclear if it is an effective treatment to inhibit other feline viral infections. Mefloquine, a small molecule inhibitor was demonstrated as an effective antiviral drug against FCoV [4] and FCV [5] replication in in vitro experiments. Our previous studies showed that LiCl [6] and germacrone [7] can efficiently inhibit FCV replication in vitro. However, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the inhibitors needs to be investigated further. So, it is urgent to develop an effective, safe and broad-spectrum antiviral drug for feline viral diseases.",

It is a parasite on Betula (birch) trunks in low latitudes (approximately 45\u201350\u00b0N) of Asia, Europe, and North America [8]. Clinical animal experiments demonstrate that IO polysaccharides may be a potential drug to prevent and cure cancer, cardiopathy, diabetes, AIDs, pancreatitis and other diseases [9], [10], [11]. IO fungus water extract shows a virucidal activity towards hepatitis C virus [12], suggesting a potential application in antiviral research. However, it is a crude extract, and the main antiviral factor remains unknown. Moreover, a crude extract may potentially exhibit stronger toxicity. Here, we evaluate the antiviral effects of IO polysaccharides (IOPs) towards multi-feline respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses such as feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline influenza virus (FIV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The results revealed that IOP possesses broad-spectrum activity against feline RNA- and DNA-viruses. Preliminary mechanism revealed that IOP acts by targeting virus entry.",

As the time of exposure to IOP was delayed, the inhibitory ability was decreased. When the cells were exposed to IOP at 6 hpi, a reduction of only 43.6% was detected (Fig. 2A). The results of the viral titer assay also showed a similar trend (Fig. 2B). IOP addition from \u22122 h to +4 h significantly inhibited viral replication (Fig. 2B).

To investigate whether the anti-FCV activity of IOP resulted from the activation of cellular factors, cells were pre-treated with IOP; then cells in CP-A treated group were infected with FCV in presence of IOP, and cells in CP-B treated group were infected with FCV without IOP. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the viral RNA level and viral titer from the CP-A treated group were significantly lower than the mock group but both levels were not reduced in the CP-B treated group while cells were pre-treated with IOP, indicating that anti-FCV activity for IOP may be not a result of activation of host factors by IOP treatment. Next, we examined whether IOP treatment induces its inhibitory actions directly on virus particles. The mixture containing virus and IOP was incubated at 4 \u00b0C for one hour and then added to cells. For the VT-A treated group, after a one-hour absorption period, the cells were continuously kept in the presence of IOP, but the VT-B treated group did not receive IOP in the medium. Both the viral RNA levels and the viral titers from the VT-A and VT-B treated groups were significantly lower than the mock group, but no significant difference was observed between the VT-A and VT-B treated groups (Fig. 2C, D). In both the VS-A and VS-B group, the mixture containing virus and IOP was directly added to cells. For the VS-A treated group, after a one-hour absorption period, cells were continuously kept in the presence of IOP, but the VS-B treated group did not receive IOP in the medium. The result from a comparison between the VS-A and \u2212B treated groups was similar to that between the VT-A and VT-B treated group, both of which indicate that IOP treatment may affect viral binding/absorpting to cells directly.",

In this study, we found that IOP potently inhibits at least five different families including RNA viruses (Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae) and DNA viruses (Alphaherpesvirinae and Parvovirus) (Table 1). To visualize the inhibitory effect of IOP, a recombinant FCV and FHV that expresses eGFP was used, and IOP treatment reduced the fluorescence intensity after infection in vitro. The time-of-addition experiment performed with FCV suggested that the early stage of viral replication is affected by IOP. Because a variety of different virus families were inhibited by IOP, it appears likely that a potential cellular factor that is essential for viral replication was activated. However, we found that IOP treatment induces its inhibitory actions directly on virus particles and may affect viral binding/absorpting to cells directly.",

Moreover, IOP showed low cytotoxicity, and the CC50 was determined to be > 1 mg/mL. The IC50 for the viruses in this study ranged from 10 \u03bcg/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL. Notably, IOP treatment shows no toxic effects on mouse major organs such as the liver, as evaluated by histopathological examinations [23]. These data indicate that IOP might be a potential feline antiviral agent due to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity and low toxicity.",

The feline viruses investigated are members of RNA and DNA viral families, many of which do not use the same entry mechanism. A previous study indicated that the extracts of Ulva fasciata (U1) can inhibit JEV infection by forming the U1-JEV complex, then blocking virus adsorption [22]. Based on the investigation of the mechanism of IOP against FCV infection, only two hours of pre-treatment with IOP for cells before infection did not contribute to their resistance to FCV infection, suggestting that hose factors activated by IOP may not play important role in anti-FCV infection. However, both treatment of addition of IOP into the virus before infection or without pretreatment could inhibit FCV replication. So we speculate IOP can absorb these virus particles, which may prevent these viruses from entering into cells.",
