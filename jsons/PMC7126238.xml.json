            "text": "Actinomycin D and nutlin-3a (A + N) synergistically activate the p53 pathway in various cell lines [1,2]. Actinomycin D is an anticancer drug, which at low concentration inhibits RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I). RNA Pol I inhibition induces nucleolar stress and has been shown to trigger phosphorylation of p53, although the mechanism of action is unclear. Nutlin-3a prevents the interaction between p53 and its negative regulator MDM2 which leads to an increased steady state level of p53 [3]. This occurrence may help actinomycin D-activated kinases phosphorylate p53. The most conspicuous signs of treatment synergy is seen in the increase in p53 with phosphorylated serine 46 (Ser46) and the increase in mRNA levels of p53-regulated genes. The phosphorylation of Ser46 is difficult to observe in the presence of actinomycin D and is undetectable in the presence of nutlin-3a. However, when both substances are applied together, the status of phospho-Ser46 p53 reaches very high levels [1,2]. The phosphorylation of Ser46 is considered a marker of activated p53, which efficiently stimulates the expression of proapoptotic genes [4]. In the A549 lung cancer cell line, Ser46 is phosphorylated upon treatment with A + N, also observed with camptothecin (CPT) treatment, an anti-cancer drug which inhibits topoisomerase I and is a strong inducer of apoptosis.",

            "text": "CPT induces death of A549 cells via characteristic of apoptosis mechanisms including morphology, sub-G1 DNA content and activation of caspase 3. Alternatively, cell death induced by A + N treatment morphologically resembles necrosis, showing characteristics such as the swelling and bursting (\u201ccell ballooning\u201d) of the cytoplasm without the extensive cell blebbing that is characteristic of apoptosis [1]. There are several forms of regulated cell death (RCD) including apoptosis, which is characterized by apoptotic morphology. Another mode of RCD, characterized by necrotic morphology, is referred to as pyroptosis [5]. Pyroptosis is triggered by the conversion of inactive pro-caspase 1 (CASP1) into active caspase-1, which cleaves gasdermin D. This protein cleavage in turn forms pores in the cell membrane leading to permeabilization, \u201ccell ballooning,\u201d and death. The activated caspase-1 triggers the destruction of cells and also cleaves pro-interleukin-1\u03b2 and pro-interleukin-18 into biologically active signaling molecules, which are strong mediators of inflammation. Interleukin-1\u03b2 is a major pyrogen which promotes influx and activation of neutrophils as well as the activation of T-cells and B-cells [6]. Interleukin-18 promotes the release of IFN-\u03b3 by NK-cells and T-cells [6]. Based on our previously reported observations [1,2] and recent work by other investigators [5,7], we hypothesized that activation of p53 by A + N co-treatment induces pyroptosis of A549 cells. We started this study with testing of this hypothesis.",

The next day, the cells were washed with culture medium and incubated with fresh medium for an additional 24 h. The cells were lysed with PLB buffer from the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) and the activity of the luciferases were measured. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla sp. luciferase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate in three independent experiments.",

Moreover, in cells exposed to A + N we observed molecular signs of autophagy, namely, the conversion of LC3B protein from cytosolic to lipidated, membrane-bound form [1]. We started this study from better characterization of fate of cells exposed to CPT or A + N. The Western blotting confirmed stronger induction of apoptosis (as determined by activation of executioner caspase-3, Fig. 1A) in cells treated with CPT when compared with other treatment modalities. Cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-8 indicate that both intrinsic and extrinsic signals (apparently in autocrine fashion) play role in the induction of apoptosis by CPT. These results are confirmed by cytometric analysis. Early apoptotic cells are frequently detected only in cells exposed to CPT (Fig. 1B). In cells exposed to A + N we observed slight increase of the percentage of necrotic cells, what is consistent with our morphological observations published previously [1].",

            "text": "In a time-course experiment, A549 cells were treated with either CPT or A + N to assess the ability of these substances to induce expression of pro-caspase 1 (CASP1). We observed strong accumulation of this protein following 48-h treatment with CPT or A + N (Fig. 2A). The expression of CASP1 and the degree of p53 activation were determined in conjunction. p53 activation was determined by assessing the amount of total p53 and the amount of p53 with phospho-Ser15, phospho-Ser46 and phospho-Ser392. Serine 15 can be phosphorylated by various kinases and, together with other phosphorylated residues, promotes stabilization of p53 while inhibiting nuclear export (reviewed in [10]). Serine 392, phosphorylated by several kinases, promotes formation of an active arrangement of p53 molecules into a tetramer which then binds to DNA and regulates the expression of target genes [11]. The p21 protein coded by CDKN1A is a marker of activation of p53 pathway [10]. Both treatment modalities induced expression of CASP1, however, it appeared late, synchronously with strong accumulation of phosphor-Ser46 p53. Our observation is consistent with the data published by Gupta et al. [12], who demonstrated that CASP1 gene is regulated by p53. However, the coincidence of CASP1 accumulation and p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 suggests that only strongly activated p53 efficiently stimulates CASP1 gene transcription. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed CASP1 gene stimulation at the transcriptional level and demonstrated a strong synergy between actinomycin D and nutlin-3a leading to the upregulation of CASP1 (Fig. 2B). While actinomycin D or nutlin-3a acting alone upregulated CASP1 mRNA, approximately 20- and 35-fold, respectively, when working together these treatments stimulated CASP1 expression to increase more than 1000-fold. Camptothecin acting alone also caused strong stimulation CASP1 mRNA, although slightly weaker (850-fold) than A + N. The Western blot showed that, consistent with RT-PCR, actinomycin D and nutlin-3a synergistically stimulated CASP1 protein expression. The synergy was also very strong in the induction of Ser392 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Thus, our data suggest that A + N or CPT treatment primes A549 cells for pyroptosis because they start to produce the executioner caspase required for this form of cell death.",

            "text": "The cleavage of pro-caspase 1 is triggered by its recruitment to multiprotein structures known as inflammasomes. The crucial elements within the inflammasomes are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). At least three major types of inflammasomes are activated by bacterial molecules or mechanical irritation. Other inflammasomes are stimulated by cytosolic, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). These DNA molecules usually originate from genomes of some viruses (e.g. EBV) or from damaged chromosomes. Cytosolic dsDNA can be recognized by two inflammasome proteins AIM2 and IFI16 (interferon gamma inducible protein 16). IFI16 indirectly activates pro-caspase-1 through adaptor protein PYCARD, which has two active isoforms (19 and 22 kDa). PYCARD, binds AIM2 or IFI16 via its PYRIN domain and binds pro-caspase 1 via its CARD domain (reviewed in [14]). Interestingly, the gene for IFI16 has been shown to be a p53-regulated gene [15]. Hence, we explored possibility that the molecules forming at least one inflammasome type were expressed in A549 cells upon treatment with A + N or CPT, results are shown in Fig. 3C. Expectedly, we detected major upregulation of IFI16 following strong activation of p53. As in the case of pro-caspase-1, actinomycin D and nutlin-3a stimulated IFI16 expression in synergistic manner. Moreover, we noticed that the aforementioned adapter protein, PYCARD, was expressed at relatively constant level (Fig. 3C). The smallest isoform of PYCARD (15 kDa), which is an inhibitor of pro-caspase-1 activation [16] was repressed upon exposure to actinomycin D, A + N or CPT (Fig. 3C). Thus, the three proteins, able to form at least one caspase-1-related inflammasome (pro-caspase 1, IFI16 and PYCARD) were expressed in A549 cells exposed to A + N or CPT. The absence of conspicuous caspase-1 activation may be the result of the lack of at least one crucial, stimulating signal. However, A549 cells appear to be primed to undergo pyroptosis.",

            "text": "Most of knowledge about pyroptosis and activation of caspase-1 comes from studies on macrophages or cell lines derived from leukemias (e.g. THP-1 cells). The induction of pyroptosis in cells derived from carcinomas is poorly explored. The commonly used protocol for induction of pyroptosis in macrophages involves pretreatment of cells with lipopolysaccharides to induce expression of NLRP3 (inflammasome element) and subsequent treatment with bacterial toxin nigericin to lower cytosilic potassium level, what is required for inflammasome assembly [17]. Because A549 cells treated with A + N contain elements of at least one inflammasome type (CASP1, IFI16, PYCARD), we decided to find out if lowering cytosolic potassium level with nigericin can induce caspase 1 activation. The cells were first exposed to A + N for 49 h (control cells were mock-treated) and subsequently, after washing, the cells (control and experimental) were either mock-treated or exposed for 70 min with 15 \u03bcM nigericin (Fig. 3D). Cells were harvested by trypsinization and protein lysates were prepared as described in Material and Methods. The blot was exposed to antibody, which recognizes endogenous level of caspase 1 only upon cleavage at Asp297. Thus, this antibody recognizes the activated (cleaved at Asp297) p20 subunit of caspase 1. Subsequently, this blot was reprobed with antibody recognizing a different epitope within the p20 subunit of caspase 1 (this antibody was used in experiment presented on Fig. 3A). The Western blots are shown on Fig. 3D. Consistent with data presented on Fig. 3A, caspase-1 was induced in cells treated with A + N but its activation was not observed (no p20 band was detected). Unexpectedly, the antibody raised against caspase 1 cleaved at Asp297 detected a protein band in cells exposed to A + N and nigericin, however the band was located between 63 and 75 kDa markers, way above expected size (20 kDa). Moreover, larger than expected protein bands (one between 75 and 100 kDa and one about 180 kDa) were also detected by the second antibody in cells exposed to A + N and nigericin (Fig. 3D). Thus, two different antibodies, raised against different epitopes within p20 subunit of caspase 1 recognized larger than expected protein species in A549 cells pretreated with A + N and exposed to nigericin. This is consistent with extensive posttranslational modifications of caspase 1, which reduce mobility of the protein during electrophoresis. However, without extensive and detailed analyses any firm conclusions can not be drawn. In short, our experiments show no evidence of \u201cclassical\u201d activation of caspase 1 in cells pretreated with A + N and exposed to nigericin.",

For example, IFI16 together with another cytosolic dsDNA binding molecule, cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), cooperates in activation of STING protein (stimulator of interferon genes), which activates TBK1 kinase, and in turn phosphorylates and activates IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors. IRF3 and IRF7 bind to the response elements of many antiviral genes and stimulate their transcription, e.g. genes coding for interferon-\u03b11 and interferon-\u03b21, IFNA1 and IFNB1, respectively [18]. Some genes coding for innate immunity proteins are regulated by p53. In addition to the aforementioned CASP1 [12] and IFI16 [15], p53 stimulates transcription of IRF5 [19], IRF7 [20], and ISG15 [21] among others. Thus, we hypothesized that p53 activated by A + N or CPT could stimulate the genes coding for proteins of innate immunity, which have not been so far identified as p53-regulated genes.",

This in turn prevented the upregulation of proteins coded by the known p53-regulated genes IFI16 and CASP1 (Fig. 5A). This shows that our experimental model can indicate if a gene is regulated in p53-dependent fashion. Using this model, we found that knockdown of p53 attenuated upregulation of STING, NLRX1 and NLRP1 proteins in cells exposed to A + N (Fig. 5A). In line with this, upregulation of their mRNAs was also attenuated in p53-knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, at the 48-h time point, the knock-down of p53 influenced the expression of neither IFIT1 nor IFIT3 (Fig. 5A, B). However, when we performed the time-course experiment with wild-type and p53 knockdown cells, we found that at earlier time-points of treatment with A + N (18\u201324 h) the expression of IFIT1 or IFIT3 was lower in p53 knockdown cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the time-course experiment demonstrated that expression of NLRP1, NLRX1 or STING was attenuated in cells with p53 knockdown throughout the treatment period, strengthening the conclusion that these three genes are regulated in p53-dependent fashion. The experiment performed with camptothecin as a stress factor yielded similar results presented in supplementary Fig. S1.

            "text": "\nOur RT-PCR and Western blotting data demonstrated that STING (TMEM173), NLRP1 and NLRX1 genes were regulated in p53-dependent manner. The STING gene contains putative p53 response element (RE) more than 3700 base-pairs downstream the transcription start site, thus it is located outside of the promoter region [22]. Hence, at this stage we excluded it from the characterization of p53 RE. The NLRX1 contains at least two plausible p53 RE identified by Tebaldi et al. [22]. One is located far downstream from the transcription start site (about 3700 bp), whereas the other is located upstream from the start of the major transcript (approximately 2200 bp). Interestingly, this site is located within the promoter of an alternative NLRX1 transcript (NLRX-212; ENST00000482180.5). We cloned this alternative promoter into the luciferase reporter vector. This DNA fragment contains a putative p53 RE defined as the three-quarter-site (3Q) because one quarter element that binds one p53 molecule of the active tetramer is missing. The canonical p53 RE consists of two decameric half-sites (RRRCWWGYYY; R - purine, Y - pyrimidine, W - A or T) arranged tandemly. This decamer in turn consists of two pentameric quarter sites (RRRCW) arranged head-to-head. The 3Q sites are still able to bind p53 tetramers, provided that p53 molecules are properly modified post translationally [11,31]. In Fig. 6A, each quarter-site and its direction are presented as an arrow and Roman numeral. In the putative p53 RE of NLRX1 alternative promoter, the quarter site number II is missing. In spite of this, wild-type p53 expressed from the vector significantly elevated luciferase activity controlled by NLRX1 promoter (Fig. 6 B and D). When the critical elements of the quarter-sites III and IV were mutated as indicated on Fig. 6A, the mutant promoter was not activated by p53 (Fig. 6B). Moreover, mutant p53 (V143A), which lost its sequence-specific binding to DNA, is no longer able to activate wild-type NLRX1 promoter (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, fragment of the cloned promoter (marked on Fig. 6A as open rectangle) contains a p53 ChIP-Seq peak (p53 binding site identified by sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody). The presence of the peak, located on chromosome 11, positions: 119,037,091-119,037,351 (genome version hg19) was reported in meta-analysis performed by Nguyen et al. [32]. The p53 ChIP-Seq peaks identified by others in this region and publically available through ChIP-Atlas tool [33] are visualized in supplementary Fig. S2. Thus, our tests combined with the ChIP-Seq data indicate that the DNA fragment, which we cloned, contains a genuine p53 RE controlling the expression of NLRX1. Hence, NLRX1 appears to be regulated through direct p53 binding to the NLRX1 promoter.",

It deviates from the consensus in three positions denoted on Fig. 6A by small-case letters. Importantly, this putative p53 RE contains two CWWG elements of the consensus. We mutated one consensus element as shown in Fig. 6A. Unexpectedly, this mutation only slightly attenuated the ability of p53 to activate the promoter (Fig. 6C). Thus, while this DNA sequence may contribute to the ability of promoter to respond to p53, there is likely another p53 binding site, which plays the major role as the p53 RE within this promoter. Critically, the mutant p53 (V143A) is not able to activate this promoter. Thus, the cloned DNA sequence of NLRP1 gene responds only to wild-type p53, but the location of the major p53 RE is not known. The aforementioned meta-analysis of the location of p53 ChIP-Seq peaks [32] may shed light on the mechanism of p53 binding to NLRP1 promoter, which contains p53 ChIP-Seq peak located in positions 5,487,941 to 5,488,641 of on chromosome 17 (genome version hg19, marked by open rectangle on Fig. 6A and visualized in supplementary Fig. S2). This sequence overlaps a DNA fragment, found to form G4 structure (see Nguyen et al. [32] and refs therein). This alternative DNA conformation forms when single-stranded guanine-rich regions fold into stable four-stranded helical structures. The vicinity of G4 s to p53 ChIP-Seq peaks was examined [32] because there is evidence that p53 can bind to some of these structural elements and by doing so it can control the expression of nearby gene [34]. Our data generate hypothesis that p53 may control the expression of NLRP1 from G4 element identified in its promoter region. This definitely warrants further investigation.",

In order to find out which kinase might be responsible for the activation of p53 under these conditions, we took a candidate-protein approach. There are many kinases that are directly or indirectly activated by PAMPs. One kinase, PKR, detects the presence of viral, double-stranded RNAs and some cellular RNA molecules appearing during stress and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor what results in inhibition of synthesis of viral proteins and production of virus progeny [35]. Moreover, PKR can phosphorylate p53 on Ser392 [30]. Hence, we decided to test the hypothesis that PKR is involved in activation of p53 in our experimental conditions.",

At 0.5 \u03bcM, C16 slightly reduced p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 and Ser392, whereas at 1.0 \u03bcM, C16 almost completely blocked phosphorylation of these residues. It was accompanied by strong inhibition (A + N) or blockage (CPT) of accumulation of p21 protein, which is encoded by the well-studied p53-regulated gene (CDKN1A) (Fig. 7A). Surprisingly, C16 did not impact p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 and Ser392 triggered by actinomycin D acting alone (Fig. 7B). C16 treatment did not reduce the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 indicating that C16 specifically influenced p53 phosphorylation on selected amino acids. Thus, C16 inhibits enzymes, which induce p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 and Ser392.",

            "text": "In order to find out if PKR is the enzyme responsible for activation of p53 upon treatment with A + N or CPT, we prepared PKR knockdown A549 cells. As shown on Fig. 8, the knockdown was successful. In cells with barely detectable expression of PKR, the activation of p53 was not changed (Fig. 8A). Moreover, C16 was able to strongly inhibit p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 and Ser392 even in cells with PKR expression considerably reduced (Fig. 8B). Thus, we conclude that in our model, p53 is phosphorylated on Ser46 and Ser392 in PKR-independent fashion. However, C16 clearly blocked not only phosphorylation of p53 but also upregulation of IFI16, NLRP1, NLRX1, STING, IFIT1 and IFIT3 induced by A + N (Fig. 8B) or camptothecin (Fig. S3), which is consistent with the hypothesis that p53 is responsible for upregulation of these genes. This activity of C16 is apparently PKR-independent as it occurs in PKR-positive as well as PKR knockdown cells (Fig. 8B and Fig. S3). Thus, our data show that p53 is activated upon CPT or A + N treatment by an unidentified kinase(s), which is (are) sensitive to the inhibition by C16. Moreover, C16-inhibited kinase is responsible for the activation of the examined innate immunity genes. To strengthen this conclusion, we performed a similar experiment using the C16 inhibitor in the parental, unmodified A549 cell line and in the U-2 OS cell line derived from osteosarcoma (Fig. 9 A, B and C). The experiment yielded similar conclusions. The C16 compound attenuated p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 and Ser392 and prevented or attenuated upregulation of innate immunity genes (STING, IFIT1, IFIT3, NLRX1, NLRP1) or well-defined p53-target genes coding for p21, IFI16 and CASP1. Thus, the C16-inhibited kinase phosphorylates p53 and stimulates innate immunity genes in at least two different cell lines, suggesting a more widespread phenomenon.",

As a positive control, we treated A549 cells with human interferon-\u03b11 (IFN-\u03b11) for 24 or 48 h. As expected, IFN-\u03b11 induced accumulation of STAT1 with phospho-Tyr701, as well as accumulation of proteins coded by interferon-stimulated genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFI16) (Fig. 10A). Moreover, IFN-\u03b11 treatment also led to accumulation of PKR protein coded by the EIF2AK2 gene known to be activated by interferon [38]. However, phosphorylated STAT1 (Tyr701) did not accumulate in cells exposed to CPT or A + N suggesting that interferons signaling through STAT1 transcription factor are not induced in these experimental conditions and that these interferons are not responsible for upregulation of the examined innate immunity genes.",

            "text": "In interferon-treated cells STAT1 is phosphorylated by JAK1 kinase. This enzyme is inhibited by SOCS1 protein, which prevents excessive stimulation of the immune system. We hypothesized that the observed attenuated phosphorylation of STAT1 was associated with increased expression of SOCS1 in cells treated with A + N (or camptothecin). Our Western blot showed that this was the case (Fig. 10B). This observation suggested that SOCS1 may be a p53-regulated gene. Using an experimental approach employed for other genes in this study, we demonstrated that strong activators of p53 (camptothecin or A + N) stimulate SOCS1 expression at both the mRNA (Fig. 11A) and protein (Fig. 11B) level, and that actinomycin D and nutlin-3a stimulate SOCS1 expression in a synergistic fashion (Fig. 11A and B). Further, we showed that the knockdown of p53 attenuated upregulation of SOCS1 (Fig. 11C, D, E), which indicates that SOCS1 is regulated in p53-dependent fashion. At this moment we do not have evidence that this gene is regulated by p53 directly. The meta- analysis of Ngueyn et al. [32] shows that there are three p53 ChIP-Seq peaks within SOCS1 promoter but they contain no p53 RE sequence motifs. Thus, strongly activated p53 may have the potential to prevent excessive stimulation of immune system. It is noteworthy that the antibody used in this experiment recognized a 37 kDa protein, whose expression did not change in any treatment conditions, in stark contrast to the RT-PCR data. The expected molecular mass of SOCS1 is 23.5 kDa. After using more sensitive detection system, the antibody recognized also a protein of approximately 24 kDa with expression pattern similar to the expression of SOCS1 mRNA (Fig. 11 A and B). Hence, we conclude that this ~24 kDa band on the blot represents SOCS1, while the 37 kDa molecule is an off-target protein.",

The detailed characterization of the secretome of these cells will be the subject of another study. Here, wanted to show an example of increased secretion of an extracellular protein induced by treatment with A + N. We selected COL17A1 protein. Its gene is directly regulated by p53 [39]. We took advantage of the fact that COL17A1 is unusual collagen molecule with its full-length form anchored in cellular membrane (~180 kDa molecule) and its extracellular domain (~120 kDa ectodomain) shed to cell environment. Increased COL17A1 shedding correlates with decreased cell motility [40]. We exposed A549 cells to A + N in complete medium for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with PBS and exposed to A + N in serum free-medium for 24 h. The control cells were mock-treated. By removing serum, we reduced the expected background staining from serum proteins. At the end of experiment the number of control cells and exposed cells was very similar. The whole cell lysate was prepared from attached cells. The medium was centrifuged at 720 g for 5 min. to remove detached cells. Subsequently, 4 ml of medium was concentrated using Vivaspin Turbo concentrators. Protein lysates and equal volumes of concentrated media were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 12A). Expectedly, we detected strong induction of COL17A1 protein in cells exposed to A + N. In cell lysate both collagen forms (180 kDa and 120 kDa) were detected. Its plausible, that cleavage of full-length molecule occurs already in vesicles transporting collagen to cell surface. However, in culture medium only the 120 kDa ectodomain was detected, the full-length form was not visible even after strong overexposure of the film. If the ectodomain in medium originated from cell lysis, we would also expect to detect the full-length molecule in the medium. Thus, we conclude that the ectodomain did not leak passively from dying cells. Hence, we infer that in cells exposed to A + N, the COL17A1 is strongly induced and its ectodomain is shed from cells modifying their environment.",

Interestingly, using ChIP-Atlas [33], we found p53 ChIP-Seq peak at the exon 1/intron 1 border of interleukin-7 gene (Fig. 12B). This ChIP-Seq peak was detected in cells expressing engineered p53 molecules with strong cooperative binding of p53 monomers [31]. We found that actinomycin D and nutlin-3a strongly synergize in the induction of IL7 (Fig. 12C). Moreover the induction of IL7 by A + N or CPT was significantly attenuated in p53 knockdown cells (Fig. 12D). Thus, strongly activated p53 has the ability to induce expression of IL7 what can change the activity of nearby immune cells because IL7 is non-redundant growth factor for many hematopoietic cell lineages especially for T and NK cells [41].",

Pro-caspase-1, coded by CASP1, was considerably upregulated by CPT or A + N, however we did not observe proteolytic activation, despite both CPT or A + N stimulating the expression of genes (IFI16, NLRP1) coding for inflammosome components required for autoproteolytic activation of pro-caspase-1. Thus, it appears that robust stimulation of p53 primes the cells to undergo caspase-1-induced death called pyroptosis, however, the bulk of cells did not die in this fashion in our experimental conditions. The fact that cells exposed to CPT or A + N express the components of inflammasomes activated by different DAMPS (NLRP1 responding to bacterial toxins and IFI16 responding to foreign, dsDNA) speaks in favor of the \u201cpriming\u201d hypothesis. It seems that the cells vaguely experience stress conditions but they determine how to die based on the ultimate, specific trigger.",

            "text": "The expression of CASP1 gene is an example of extreme synergy between actinomycin D and nutlin-3a in stimulating expression of p53-regulated gene (Fig. 2, Fig. 3A). Using our p53 knockdown cells, we confirmed the observation of Gupta et al. [12] and Schlereth et al. [31] that CASP1 is upregulated in p53-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A), however, p53 must be properly, post-translationally modified in order to stimulate CASP1 expression. Phosphorylation of Ser46 and Ser392 appear to be among such key modifications (Fig. 5A, 9B), but other modifications are likely also required. Interestingly, Schlereth et al. [31] found that activation of CASP1 gene by p53 critically depends on the cooperation of p53 molecules forming the DNA-binding tetramer. Mutations of p53, which specifically destroy the cooperativity of p53 molecules, do not significantly influence the ability of p53 tetramer to activate the cell cycle inhibitors (e.g. p21). However, these mutations can completely destroy the ability of p53 to activate CASP1. Hence, we suspect that CPT or A + N, which strongly stimulate CASP1, promote post-translational modifications that may favor cooperative binding between p53 monomers. Here, the question arises, as to what physiological conditions result in p53 activation to the degree that allows for CASP1 gene stimulation. This level of activation can be achieved with camptothecin and possibly with anticancer drugs derived from camptothecin (topotecan, irinotecan), which are widely used in clinic. Hence, it is possible, that camptothecin-related drugs facilitate pyroptosis. However, what conditions beyond treatment with anticancer drugs are able to strongly stimulate p53 in vivo? We suspect, that these conditions occur locally within tissues and are associated with infections from various pathogens, which initially induce local tissue damage, secrete various toxins and trigger activity of immune cells, in turn releasing a plethora of locally-acting toxic factors including DNA-damaging ROS. Biologically, actinomycin D is an antibiotic, toxic also to eukaryotic cells, produced by Streptomyces antibioticus, a Gram-positive bacterium living in soil [42]. Is it possible that the strong activation of p53 can result from similar toxins produced by bacteria able to infect humans? Some soil bacteria from Streptomyces genus were found to produce infections in immunodeficient individuals or in humans living in tropical regions [43,44]. In the context of this conjecture, it is not surprising that strong activation of p53 is associated with the induction of many immunity genes detected in this study. We found that A + N or CPT treatment stimulated the expression of IFIT1, IFIT3, NLRP1, NLRX1, IL7 and STING (TMEM173) genes, which code for proteins involved in innate immunity and which have not been identified so far as p53-regulated genes. In cells with knocked-down expression of p53, the upregulation of NLRP1, NLRX1, IL7 and STING was attenuated, indicating that these four genes are regulated in p53-dependent fashion. The activation of IL7 gene indicates that p53 can modify the microenvironment of cell by sending signals, which help in proliferation and survival of nearby immune cells. In case of NLRP1 and NLRX1 we were able to show that the gene promoters were activated by ectopically expressed p53. Moreover, for NLRX1, we identified the p53 RE within its promoter using the site-directed mutagenesis. According to published meta-analyses [45,46], some high-throughput studies noticed that NLRP1, NLRX1, IL7 and STING are regulated in p53-dependent fashion in some cell lines and in some treatment conditions. However, according to the criteria used by the authors of the meta-analyses, these genes are not p53 targets. This apparent discrepancy may result from the fact that some of the original studies did not use stress factors, which activate p53 enough to stimulate expression of these genes. Hence, probably they fell below a certain threshold in the meta-analysis to be considered a \u201cdirect p53 target\u201d.",

However, with the data at hand, it is safer to conclude that the regulation of IFIT1 and IFIT3 by p53 is an open issue, which needs to be clarified.",

            "text": "The NLRX1 and NLRP1 genes are new additions to the list of p53-regulated genes coding for innate immunity proteins. In addition to the aforementioned CASP1 and IFI16, p53 is required for optimal upregulation of ISG15, which codes for a protein with direct antiviral activity [21]. IRF5 and IRF7, regulated by p53, code for transcription regulators stimulating expression of interferons and inflammatory cytokines [19,20]. IRF9, which forms complex with activated STAT1 and STAT2 and stimulates expression of many antiviral effector molecules, is also regulated by p53 [47]. Thus, p53 can facilitate the production of interferons. Hence, it is not surprising that many viruses, even the ones that are not associated with cancer, e.g. SARS coronavirus [48], produce proteins, which inactivate p53. Strikingly, p53 was discovered because it formed tight complex with viral protein [49]. In this context, our finding that strongly activated p53 induces expression of STING is pivotal in that it points to another mechanism used by p53 to stimulate the synthesis of these antiviral cytokines. STING is located at the crossroad of two signaling pathways. One pathway emerges from the detection of DNA viruses (by cGAS or IFI16 proteins), while the second originates from the detection of RNA viruses (by RIG-I receptors) and both converge on the activation of IRF3 transcription factor, which directly stimulates the transcription of genes for type I interferons [18]. We found that in spite of strong upregulation of STING, interferons are not produced in our model, which can be inferred from the lack of STAT1 phosphorylation in cells exposed to CPT or A + N. Probably, the cells are primed for interferon production but they lack a specific trigger (e.g. infection by a virus) to actually activate transcription of interferon genes.",

            "text": "Our hypothesis that PKR was responsible for p53 activation leading to the induction of innate immunity genes was not supported by observations. Although the activation of p53 and induction of innate immunity genes was blocked by C16, a specific inhibitor of PKR, the near complete knockdown of PKR did not prevent activation of p53 or upregulation of innate immunity genes. Moreover, C16 was able to block p53 activation and upregulation of innate immunity genes even in cells with almost full knockdown of PKR. This is probably another example of the off-target activity of a kinase inhibitor. Whatever the target(s) of C16, the kinase(s) blocked by this compound play major role in activation of p53 in response to CPT or A + N treatment. Even in submicromolar concentrations C16 inhibited phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46 and Ser392. Moreover, C16 did not block phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15 which argues against general block of many kinases. We do not know if C16 blocks the activity of kinases that directly phosphorylate p53 on Ser46 and Ser392 or if it blocks the activity of a kinase, which phosphorylates p53 on other amino acid forming a signal for other kinases to modify Ser46 and Ser392. Some studies demonstrated that C16 protects against tissue damage and inflammation, especially in the central nervous system [36,50,51]. In light of our observation that C16 inhibits p53 activation and the fact that p53 is strong inducer of cell death, it must be considered that some cytoprotective activities of this compound are mediated through the inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis or inflammation. The off-target activity of C16 has been already noticed by other investigators [52]. In our opinion, the search for p53-activating kinase inhibited by C16 is of great importance as it may be playing major role in stimulating p53-regulated apoptosis and innate immunity.",

            "text": "A surprising finding of this study is the activation of SOCS1 expression by A + N or CPT in p53-dependent manner. SOCS1 protein inhibits the signaling through the pathway stimulated by various cytokines including type I (e.g. IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2) and type II (IFN-\u03b3) interferons [53]. Hence, SOCS1 appears to be another gene of innate immunity system regulated by p53. SOCS1, in contrast with other p53-regulated genes mentioned in this Discussion, inhibits interferon-induced signaling. It may seem counter-intuitive, but in our opinion it is plausible. We suspect that the p53-SOCS1 relationship is a part of a negative feedback loop within the p53-innate immunity signaling system. A good analogy is p53-MDM2 relationship in the p53 signaling system. In this loop, p53 activates MDM2 gene, which codes for the negative regulator of p53 [46]. We hypothesize that p53-dependent SOCS1 has the task of quickly silencing the signaling when the stress factor disappears. It is also possible that SOCS1 prevents excessive stimulation of innate immunity when p53 is activated by a strong stress factor and the cells are additionally exposed to interferons (not unusual situation in lung epithelium for instance). It was found by others that SOCS1 can be upregulated by nutlin-3a (a specific p53 activator) in acute myeloid leukemia cells which also supports the notion that SOCS1 is p53-dependent gene [54]. Thus, the data presented in this paper and the observations made by others support the notion that the innate immunity is the stress-response system strongly influenced by p53. Moreover, upregulation of antiviral genes by CPT or A + N is another observation in the growing body of evidence that anticancer chemotherapeutic agents have strong antiviral properties resulting from upregulation innate immunity genes [55]. This property of anticancer drugs must be carefully considered when planning for the anticancer strategies combining the use of oncolytic virotherapy with chemotherapeutic agents [56].",

Considering the functions of their proteins, we conclude that strongly stimulated p53 primes the cells for pyroptosis and for the induction of interferon genes. Activation of NLRP1, NLRX1, STING, IL7 and SOCS1 is p53-dependent, i.e., downregulation of p53 attenuates their expression. In the regulation of innate immunity, p53 plays double role, by inducing some genes (e.g. STING) it helps to trigger interferon production and by inducing SOCS1 it prevents excessive stimulation of the interferon signaling. In our experimental conditions both activation of p53 and upregulation of innate immunity proteins is strongly inhibited by C16, an anti-inflammatory substance, considered a specific inhibitor of PKR kinase, but acting in our model in an apparently PKR-independent manner. Thus, an unidentified kinase inhibited by C16 plays a major role both in activation of p53 and in stimulation of a subset of innate immunity genes.",

The expression of IFIT3, IFIT1, SOCS1, STAT1 (total or phosphorylated) and p53 was examined by Western blotting. C. Quantitative Western blot analysis of IFIT3 in A549 cells exposed as indicated. The means and standard deviation were calculated from Western blots of protein lysates prepared from three biological replicates. Because IFIT3 was undetectable in control cells, its expression was set as 1 in cells exposed to A + N.",
