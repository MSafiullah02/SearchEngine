The majority of adenocarcinomas of the cervix and of squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the vulva, vagina, penis, and anus are caused by HPV-16 and HPV-18 (together accounting for about 70 % of cases globally), the remaining 30 % being due to other high-risk HPV types (such as HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51, HPV-66). The relative importance of different high-risk types varies between countries and regions, but type 16 has the greatest contribution to cervical cancer in all regions.

The early proteins are nonstructural proteins involved in replication and transcription of the genome (E1\u2013E5) or in host cell tumoral transformation (E6 and E7), whereas L1 and L2 are the structural capsid proteins of the virion. The low-grade cervical dysplasias correspond to productively infected cells that actively shed virus, whereas high-grade dysplasias and cancers do not produce virions: viral gene expression in these cells is limited to the E6 and E7 oncogenes that are transcribed from randomly integrated viral DNA. The E7 protein is thought to induce cell proliferation and disrupt the cell cycle regulation by inactivation of the Rb family proteins, whereas E6 blocks cell apoptosis by directing the p53 tumor suppressor protein to the proteasome.",

The most advanced and promising approach for a prophylactic vaccine involves the use of noninfectious recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) which self-assemble spontaneously from pentamers of the L1 capsid protein. Two prophylactic vaccine candidates are at the level of phase III clinical evaluation and the companies have filed for licensure. GSK is focusing on a bivalent HPV-16, HPV-18 VLP vaccine candidate and Merck is developing a tetravalent vaccine based on VLPs from HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18.

            "text": "Understanding the incredibly complex biology of the HIV virus is essential for building effective diagnostics and drugs. HIV belongs to a class of viruses known as retroviruses because it contains ribonucleic acid (RNA) as its genetic material. After the HIV virus infects a cell, it uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA so that it can replicate itself using the host cell\u2019s own replication machinery. The HIV replication cycle begins with fusion of the virus to the host cell surface, which begins the influx of viral proteins into the host cell. After viral DNA is formed by reverse transcription and integrated into the host DNA, new viral RNA is used as genomic RNA to make viral proteins, which travel to the cell surface to form a new HIV virus. This vicious cycle rapidly produces several billion new viruses every day in persons infected with HIV and is further complicated by the ability of reverse transcriptase to mutate, causing new strains of HIV to develop in infected individuals. HIV targets the immune system directly by infecting CD4+ lymphocytes, which also leads to the systematic degradation of the immune system because CD4+ cells are pivotal in helping immune responses (Blum 2005). The constant process of evolution and replication in the HIV virus creates incredible stress for the immune system and has been one of the reasons why HIV has been especially difficult for medical researchers to combat. Drugs against HIV are called antiretroviral drugs because HIV is considered a retrovirus as previously described and the drugs fall into three classes consistent with the underlying biology of the virus: (1) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), (2) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and (3) protease inhibitors (PIs) (Pirmohamed 2001). Reverse transcriptase inhibitors directly inhibit the reproductive capacity of the HIV virus because of the mandatory role the reverse transcriptase enzyme plays in viral reproduction. NRTIs contain faulty versions of the nucleotides used by reverse transcriptase to convert RNA to DNA, causing improper build of the new DNA so that HIV\u2019s genetic material cannot be incorporated into the healthy genetic material of the host cell. On the other hand, NNRTIs work by attaching themselves to reverse transcriptase and prevent the enzyme from converting RNA to DNA. After viral RNA is translated into a polypeptide sequence, the sequence is assembled into a long chain that includes the proteins like reverse transcriptase and protease.",

All guidelines come to the result that HIV drug resistance testing should be performed when a HIV-infected person enters into clinical care, whether he is treated immediately or not. The aim of this strategy is to detect chances of transmitted resistance as maximum as possible. In HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy, resistance testing should be performed in the presence of virological failure. To ensure adequate performance of resistance testing, HIV-1 RNA levels should be at least 1,000 copies/ml at the time of testing, although guidelines agree that resistance testing could be also attempted in individuals with HIV-1 RNA levels between 500 and 1,000 copies/ml. However, in this last group of patient, the chances of amplifying HIV-1 sequences are markedly lower. Drug resistance testing might also be helpful when managing suboptimal viral load reduction. However, this is less clear because the addition of, or switch to, new antiretroviral drugs could be helpful to achieve viral suppression. Importantly, given that drug resistance mutations wane after treatment interruption, drug resistance testing in the setting of virological failure should be performed while the patient is taking his/her antiretroviral drugs or within 4 weeks after discontinuing therapy.",

            "text": "The quantitative analysis of HIV-1 is based on viral load assay. Viral load assay is expressed by the copy number in a given unit of plasma, usually using copies/ml. An alternative expression is the international unit suggested by WHO (IU/ml). Based on the interlaboratory standardization using the three FDA-approved HIV-1 viral load kits, the exchange relationship between the copies/ml and the IU/ml is between 1:0.92 and 1:1 (www.fda.gov/cber/pmalabel/p050069LB). Viral load is a dynamic and relative parameter. Its value changes depending on methods used and it can fluctuate even on a daily basis. The variances between repeated tests using the same kit are usually smaller than those determined with different methods. Thus, a dynamic comparison of viral load values using the same assay method over time is strongly suggested. HIV viral load has multiple clinical implications (Report on the global AIDS epidemic 2007; Torti et al. 2007). Firstly, it currently serves as a complementary diagnosis of HIV infection and may become one of the diagnosis standards in the near future. For qualitative determination of HIV infection, the higher the viral load value is measured, the more confident a diagnosis of HIV infection can be drawn. For example, if the viral load is higher than 3,000 copies/ml, the probability of HIV infection of the individual from whom the sample is taken is significantly high, particularly if high viral load is repeatable with another sample taken from the same individual at a different time. Secondly, viral load is helpful for early diagnosis of HIV infection. It is reported that there is a viral burst in blood in the early stage of HIV infection. The viral load in the early stage is sometimes even higher than that in the disease stage of AIDS. The viral load assay can also be used in the complementary diagnosis of HIV infection for neonates from HIV-infected mothers. Although the antibody-based HIV assay is the diagnosis standard in clinical practice, it is useless during its window period in the early stage of infection and has no diagnostic value for infants from HIV-infected mothers as discussed earlier. Thirdly, the analysis of the viral load is an efficient parameter in assessing antiviral therapy. The effective standard is the viral load decreased at least by 0.5 log after 4-week or 1 log after an 8-week antiviral therapy or the viral load reduced to 1,000 copies/ml after a 16\u201324-week therapy. Finally, the viral load has some values in predicting the progress of AIDS. For example, the viral load can predict the probability (p value) of becoming AIDS in 6 years for patients with normal CD4+ counts. The p value is 0.054 when the viral load is less than 500 copies/ml and the p value dramatically increased to 0.8 when the viral load is more than 30,000 copies/ml. When CD4+ counts are less than 200/\u03bcl, the viral load can be used to predict a shorter progress of AIDS. The probability of turning to AIDS within 3\u20136 months from viral carrier is proportionally associated with the viral load values. A similar conclusion was drawn from a recent clinical trial including 751 HIV-infected patients with b200 CD4+/mm3 before HAART (Torti et al. 2007). Patients with higher CD4+ T-cell counts following the treatment appeared to have survived after month 3, whereas those with increasing HIV RNA N400 copies/ml did not. The three methods currently employed in commercial kits for HIV-1 viral load assays are rt-PCR-, b DNA-, and NASBA-based assays. Table 28.4 shows the comparison of three FDA-approved HIV-1 viral load assays commonly used in assessment with their advantages and disadvantages.\n",

Therefore, the resources of the various settings remain the determinant factor for choosing the PCR-based, hybridization-based, or isothermal amplification-based HIV detection assays. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rt-PCR-based assay is the most frequently used technology in molecular biology and molecular diagnostics. PCR-based assays can be used for either the qualitative or quantitative analysis of HIV. As HIV is a retrovirus, both PCR and rt-PCR are used as qualitative assays of viral infection targeting the integrated form of provirus or the free HIV themselves, respectively. The rt-PCR is however specifically required in HIV viral load assay. The amplified products from PCR or rt-PCR can be visualized by a variety of methods, such as agarose gel electrophoresis, real-time visualization, and enzymatic reaction. One commercial kit, Amplicor, uses enzymatic reaction for product visualization with microplate platform (Murphy et al. 2000). Considering the complicated procedure for the Amplicor assay as the post-amplification hybridization and enzymatic reaction for visualization involves multiple steps and many types of reagents, real-time visualization is advantageous in the development of new rt-PCR-based assays for HIV viral load analysis (Stevens et al. 2007). The simplicity and shorter time required for finishing the test make the rt-PCR-based HIV viral load assay to be more competitive among all available kits and possibly to be one of the focus in future kits under development.",

The molecular beacon can have a mix of target-specific sequences in its loop and target-independent sequences in its hairpin. This mixed beacon adds one short fragment to be identified and thus helps to enhance the specificity of the assay.

Moreover, HIV viral load testing has served as the major guide to the selection and maintenance of antiretroviral therapy (Sagreiya et al. 2010).",

            "text": "While it is well known that carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causal agents of cervical cancer, HPV infections are extremely common relative to rare cancer incidence, indicating that many infections spontaneously resolve (Schiffman et al. 2007) or persist without progression. Host genetic factors may play a role in cervical carcinogenesis and are thought to influence who develops persistent HPV infection and perhaps who further progresses to cancer (Czene et al. 2002; Hemminki and Chen 1999; Hemminki et al. 2006; Hussain et al. 2008; Hildesheim and Wang 2002; Carrington et al. 2005). The roles of host genetic factors and other cofactors associated with cervical cancer are summarized in Tables 28.5 and 28.6. As discussed by Safaeian et al. (2012), it is particularly very interesting because the stepwise pathogenesis of the disease has been extensively studied. From its initiation through HPV infection at the cervical transformation zone, and subsequent steps related to viral persistence, progression to precancer, and invasion (Schiffman et al. 2007), the same or different factors can be associated with each step toward pathogenesis. The role of nongenetic cofactors in persistence and progression has been well studied, but there are fewer studies on the host genetics role on the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.\n\n\n",

At this point, there are very few possible explanations and few strong, mechanistic clues (Thio and Thomas 2010). It is speculated that these variants correlate with the regulation of the cytokine IL28B transcription, because these SNPs are located upstream of the IL28B gene (Thio and Thomas 2010). The observations cited earlier by Suppiah and colleagues and Tanaka and colleagues strongly suggest that the identified SNPs do indeed alter the expression of the IL28B and, perhaps, IL28A genes (Suppiah et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2009). These two studies found that those who carried the G risk allele at the SNP rs8099917 had lower mRNA expression of the cytokine IL28B in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Suppiah et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2009). On the other hand, Ge and colleagues reported no difference in cytokine IL28B expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 80 HCV-uninfected persons homozygous for a proxy allele for the SNP rs12979860, using the SNPExpress database (Ge et al. 2009).

However, still more pieces of data are needed to complete the mechanistic picture (Thio and Thomas 2010). The IL28B gene encodes IFN-lambda-3, which is one of the recently discovered type III interferons (or lambda interferons), and belongs to the IL10 superfamily (Dellgren et al. 2009). Other type III interferons are the cytokines IL28A and IL29. Some murine studies have revealed the preferential expression of IFN-lambda receptors on epithelial surfaces and have suggested that type III interferons may allow the host to rapidly eliminate viruses at the major portals of entry into the body before infection is established, without activating other arms of the immune system (Ank et al. 2006, 2008; Ank and Paludan 2009). Nonetheless, one important difference established between the murine and human systems is that the interleukin (Liapakis and Jacobson 2010); receptor alpha chain (receptor complex induced by IFN-lambda) is expressed in human hepatocytes, whereas the murine liver seems unlikely to respond to IFN-lambda (Ank et al. 2006, 2008; Ank and Paludan 2009). This finding suggests that IFN-lambda contributes to host defense against hepatotropic viruses, such as HCV in humans. Like type I interferons, lambda interferons have activity against HCV and other viral infections in vitro and in vivo (Marcello et al. 2006). However, in vitro exogenous IFN-lambda induces a slower, more sustained abundance of IFN-stimulated genes than IFN-alpha (Marcello et al. 2006). Although these findings answer why IFN-lambda might play a key role in HCV recovery, they do not explain why treatment-associated resolution of HCV infection is associated with certain base sequences located upstream of the start codon for the cytokine IL28B (Thio and Thomas 2010).",

Participants with fibrosis score 3 had not previously responded to IFN treatment with or without RBV, had a Child\u2013Turcotte\u2013Pugh score of less than seven, and were treated with peg-IFN and RBV for 24 weeks and then up to 48 weeks if undetectable at week 20. Recent study by Welzel and colleagues, they examined the SNPs in genes encoding IFN-alpha, the IFN-alpha receptor, and JAK/tyrosine kinase/STAT 1 and 2, all part of the signal transduction via the JAK\u2013STAT pathway; IFN-alpha-induced genes with antiviral properties, including adenosine deaminase/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A-alpha kinase 2/NFKB1/myxovirus resistance 1/2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1; as well as interferon regulatory factor (Welzel et al. 2009). In a recent study, Ke and colleagues (2010) extended the previous research and applied both ANN algorithms and logistic regression with feature selection to predict IFN-alpha and RBV treatment outcomes using genetic factors. The cohort of 523 CHC patients was original to the previous study by Lin (2006).",

By computationally analyzing the interaction of a putative drug with a sampling of the polymorphism structural repertoire that a new drug will encounter in the clinic, it is possible to predict the binding effectiveness of a new drug before the initiation of expensive clinical evaluation in patients. This is a straightforward application and extension of the recently reported successful computational prediction of drug resistance phenotypes for HIV-1 protease on a patient-by-patient basis (Shenderovich et al. 2003). The interaction and movements of side chains in individual polymorphism structures in response to drug binding can be computed, for example, comparison of the computed structural changes upon drug binding with the observed changes in the corresponding X-ray crystallographic structure (Hong et al. 2000) of the saquinavir\u2013HIV protease complex.",

The numbers appear to be quite good in comparison to what is achievable in the laboratory at present. However, perhaps what is most important, with respect to increased efficiency and speed in drug design, is that answers can be generated overnight rather than in 3\u20136 weeks (the typical timeframe for laboratory drug resistance phenotyping). Another way of looking at the interaction of putative drugs or drug leads with a set of drug-target polymorphisms is to dock the molecules to the individual polymorphisms and measure the distance of the drug to each residue within the protein.

In addition to naturally occurring infectious agents, it is clear that there is significant value in biodefense-related applications in rational drug and vaccine design and in threat assessment and prediction. Understanding and managing the adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the landscape of HIV disease in a way that seemed unthinkable a decade ago. The first HAART regimens worked in suppressing virus but were encumbered by a variety of short-term and long-term side effects. More recent regimens became simpler, easier to take, and with fewer adverse events. Knowledge of both the short- and long-term adverse events associated with HAART is essential for providers and for patients. For new drugs to be acceptable in the current field, they will have to pass a litmus test of tolerability. Since adverse events are often remarkably idiosyncratic, pharmacogenomics may offer a way of predicting side effects and their severity from a particular drug or drug class in individual patients.",

While randomized, controlled clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of drugs, they may underestimate short-term toxicity in the general clinic population because of the desire of the subjects to stay in the trial and the support from the trial staff in enabling them to do so. Long-term toxicities may be missed because of the often younger age of the subjects in clinical trials and because the relatively short-term duration of these trials may not detect toxicities with a low prevalence rate; Table 28.11 shows the adverse effects associated with different classes of antiretroviral. AEs of antiretroviral drugs can be usefully divided into short- and long-term toxicities and also by the class of agent used.\n\n",

They essentially include the M184V mutation, the Q151M complex of mutations, and the K65R mutation (Table 28.12). The M184V mutation involves the replacement of methionine by valine at position 184 of the reverse transcriptase and is the main mutation that confers resistance to lamivudine (Boucher et al. 1993). Methionine 184 is located at the heart of the catalytic site of reverse transcriptase, and its replacement by a valine, which has a different side chain, interferes with the proper positioning of lamivudine triphosphate within the catalytic site (Sarafianos et al. 1999). The M184V mutation induces very high levels of resistance to lamivudine. When lamivudine is used as a single agent, resistant strains overtake wild-type virus in a few weeks (Schuurman et al. 1995), and when lamivudine is used as part of a failing regimen of HAART, the M184V mutation is almost always the first mutation to emerge (Havlir et al. 2000). The group of mutations referred to as the Q151M complex (Iversen et al. 1996) (Table 28.12) is most often selected for in the course of the failure of regimens containing stavudine and didanosine. This pathway always starts with the Q151M substitution, a residue located in the immediate vicinity of the nucleotide-binding site of reverse transcriptase, and is followed by the gradual accumulation of secondary mutations that enhance resistance and increase the activity of the enzyme (Kosalaraksa et al. 1999). The Q151M complex is relatively rare in HIV-1 (fewer than 5 % of all HIV strains with resistance to nucleoside analogues) but can confer high-level resistance to most but not all (e.g., lamivudine and tenofovir) analogues (Iversen et al. 1996). Interestingly, the Q151M complex is markedly more frequent in HIV-2 than in HIV-1. The K65R mutation is seen with increasing frequency in patients in whom therapy with nucleoside or nucleotide analogues fails, especially when the regimen includes tenofovir or abacavir. This mutation appears to confer resistance to most analogues, with the exception of zidovudine.",

            "text": "Removal of the nucleoside analogue from the terminated DNA chain is associated with a group of mutations commonly termed \u201cthymidine analogue mutations\u201d (Table 28.12). Mutations from this group are most frequently selected for after the failure of drug combinations that include thymidine analogues, such as zidovudine and stavudine, but they can promote resistance to almost all nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, including tenofovir (Larder and Kemp 1989; Picard et al. 2001). These mutations occur gradually, and their order of emergence can vary. Thymidine analogue mutations promote resistance by fostering ATP- or pyrophosphate-mediated removal of nucleoside analogues from the 3\u2032 end of the terminated DNA strand (Meyer et al. 1999). ATP and pyrophosphate, which are abundant in normal lymphocytes, do not participate in the DNA-polymerization reaction, but the structure of a reverse transcriptase expressing thymidine analogue mutations facilitates their entry into a site adjacent to the incorporated analogue (Chamberlain et al. 2002). In this position, ATP or pyrophosphate can attack the phosphodiester bond that links the analogue to DNA, resulting in removal of the analogue. Interestingly, the efficiency of this process, also known as \u201cprimer rescue,\u201d can be significantly decreased by the presence of other mutations in reverse transcriptase, a phenomenon that has been best described in the case of the M184V mutation (Larder et al. 1995). As a consequence; M184V slows the selection of thymidine analogue mutations by thymidine analogues (Picard et al. 2001) and may slightly increase the residual antiviral activity of some nucleoside analogues in spite of the presence of thymidine analogue mutations.",

Unlike the inhibitors, the natural substrates of the protease have a variable, but generally less tight, interaction with the catalytic site, a phenomenon that promotes the ordered sequential cleavage of the polyproteins required for proper assembly of the viral particle. Resistance mutations in the protease, which result in an overall enlargement of the catalytic site of the enzyme, would thus be predicted to have a greater effect on the binding of inhibitors than the natural templates. Some mutations are selected for only by certain protease inhibitors (Table 28.12), reflecting particularities in the chemical structure of the inhibitors that influence their interaction with the substrate-binding domain of the enzyme. However, there is considerable overlap between the combinations of mutations in HIV strains that develop resistance to protease inhibitors. This overlap explains the wide cross-resistance that is generally observed within this drug class (Schapiro et al. 1999).",

The early steps in this process allow gp41, the fusogenic component of the complex, to interact with the cell membrane, thereby tethering the virus to its target. The membranes of the virus and target cell are then brought into close proximity, fostering their fusion, by further rearrangement of gp41. In this step, a distal hydrophobic region of gp41, HR2, folds onto a more proximal hydrophobic region, HR1, effectively shortening the molecule. Enfuvirtide, a 36-aminoacid peptide derived from HR2, destabilizes this process by binding to HR1 and blocks the infectivity of HIV-1. Viral resistance to enfuvirtide usually results from mutations located in a stretch of ten amino acids within HR1 (Rimsky et al. 1998). Interestingly, changes in amino acids in gp41 outside HR and even changes in gp120 appear to be associated with significant differences in the susceptibility of the virus to enfuvirtide. These mutations or polymorphisms probably explain the remarkably wide range of natural susceptibility to enfuvirtide among HIV-1 strains (Derdeyn et al. 2001; Reeves et al. 2002) and could participate in the evolution of acquired resistance to enfuvirtide.",

Cross-resistance is always restricted to drugs within a given class of antiretroviral agents but all three classes of antiretroviral drugs are affected. Early in the evolution of resistance to nucleoside analogues or protease inhibitors, viruses may have only a low level of cross-resistance to alternative agents within each of these two classes of drugs (Richman 1990). Nevertheless, these strains may need to add only one or a few additional mutations to this preexisting scaffolding for high-level cross-resistance to develop. Therefore, in patients infected with strains that have low levels of cross-resistance, the switch to apparently active alternative drugs can be accompanied by rapid selection for highly resistant variants, at the expense of minimal evolutionary changes (Dulioust et al. 1999).

Single mutations in the hydrophobic pocket of reverse transcriptase also provide strong resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, but the viral strains in patients in whom regimens using these drugs are failing often incur additional mutations, suggesting that the level of resistance provided by single mutations is not optimal (Hanna et al. 2000). Resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors through the accumulation of thymidine analogue mutations or Q151M complex mutations and resistance to protease inhibitors are always gradual processes, leading to progressive increases in the level of resistance (Mammano et al. 2000). Nonetheless, even after several mutations have accumulated in the HIV protease and reverse transcriptase sufficient to produce patent treatment failure, resistance may not have reached maximal levels, and additional mutations, associated with increases in resistance, can occur even in the absence of any changes in treatment (Barbour et al. 2002). Indeed, the development of complete resistance may represent an exception. Because resistance mutations can impair viral replicative capacity, the solution adopted by the dominant viral population may entail making concessions in terms of resistance. Efforts are being made to evaluate the antiviral activity retained by individual drugs in the face of resistance mutations. Such knowledge may help in the treatment of patients infected with viruses that express resistance to multiple classes of drugs, since keeping HIV under some pharmacologic pressure may reduce its pathogenic potential.",

            "text": "Many resistance mutations impair viral replication. Because these mutations modify key viral proteins, they have deleterious effects of variable extent on protein function. Although some of these deficits can be partially corrected by compensatory mutations (Nijhuis et al. 1999), viruses forced to develop higher levels of resistance under intense and continuous pressure by antiretroviral drugs often have a substantial impairment in their replicative capacity (Barbour et al. 2002). The degree of replicative impairment conferred by resistance mutations is highly variable. The most crippling mutations appear to be those associated with resistance to protease inhibitors (Zennou et al. 1998), but significant replicative defects can be related to mutations in reverse transcriptase that confer resistance to nucleoside analogues or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Back et al. 1996; Bleiber et al. 2001) as well as envelope mutations associated with resistance to enfuvirtide. The clinical effect of resistance-associated loss of viral replicative capacity is the subject of intense investigation. Several observations suggest that resistant viruses have lost some of their virulence. When antiretroviral treatment is interrupted in patients infected with HIV that is resistant to multiple drugs, the resistant strain is more or less rapidly replaced by wild-type virus. This change is accompanied by a drop in CD4 T-cell counts, suggesting that wild-type virus has a greater replicative and pathogenic potential (Deeks et al. 2001). In a significant proportion of patients in whom HAART is failing, the CD4 T-cell counts remain significantly above pretreatment levels, despite the poor control of replication (Kaufmann et al. 1998). Whether this apparent immunologic benefit of HAART in spite of patent virologic failure is the direct consequence of reduced viral pathogenicity, a sign of persistent residual activity of some drugs in the regimen, or both, remains to be elucidated. Consequently, therapeutic strategies that take advantage of resistance-associated loss of HIV replicative capacity have yet to be identified.",

            "text": "However, recent data of CATCH and the US-based studies suggested that transmitted drug-resistant HIV can remain the dominant population in peripheral blood for an extended period of time. Furthermore, a study analyzed the baseline nucleotide sequences among 11 subjects with primary HIV infection who showed variation against antiretroviral therapy (Little et al. 2004). The patients had been infected for approximately 65 days and had at least one major drug resistance mutation. Longitudinal samples were collected for a median of 225 days after infection and analyzed for persistence of transmitted drug-resistant variants. Seven patients had evidence of NNRTI resistance, two patients had resistance to both NRTIs and PIs, and one patient had triple-class resistance. The average time to reversion of the K103N variants to mixed 103 N/K populations in the seven patients with NNRTI resistance was 196 days following the estimated date of infection. In the four patients with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors, no reversion to wild type was detected at 64, 191, 327, and 342 days after infection. Complete reversion of genotypic resistance was observed in only one patient at 1,019 days after infection. Dr. Kuritzkes concluded the data presented at the 11th CROI by a team of investigators at Gilead Sciences (Borroto-Esoda et al. 2004). Study FTC-301A compared once-daily emtricitabine (Emtriva) to once-daily stavudine (Zerit), both combined with didanosine (Videx) and efavirenz (Sustiva), in 571 treatment-na\u00efve patients from North America, Latin America, and Europe. Overall, 90/546 (16 %) evaluable patients entered the study with HIV mutations at positions associated with resistance to NNRTIs. There were no differences in the prevalence or type of mutations between the groups. For subjects with wild-type virus at baseline, the incidence of virologic failure was 12 % in the stavudine group and 5 % in the emtricitabine group. Among patients with drug-resistant virus at baseline, virologic failure occurred in 32 % of the stavudine group and 13 % of the emtricitabine group.",

In this study, 345 patients were randomized to receive either tenofovir or efavirenz, combined with a fixed-dose combination tablet containing 600 mg abacavir and 300 mg lamivudine, all to be taken once a day. Patients were na\u00efve to antiretroviral therapy prior to starting the study and had an average baseline viral load of 4.63 log10 copies/ml and a baseline CD4+ cell count of 260 cells/mm3. Because of a glaringly high number of treatment failures being documented in the triple-NRTI group, the study investigators conducted an unplanned analysis involving the first 194 patients who completed 8 weeks of follow-up. Approximately 49 % of patients in the triple-NRTI group met the definition of virologic failure, compared to only 5.4 % patients in the efavirenz-based arm. Tenofovir, abacavir, and lamivudine can all select for the K65R mutation. Among 21 patients who had viral loads that were high enough to test for drug resistance, 10 (48 %) had the K65R mutation. Tenofovir, abacavir, and lamivudine all exert concerted pressure on the 65 locus, and, with the emergence of that single mutation, it is able to abrogate the efficacy of the regimen with a single stroke.",

This effectively terminates chain extension and, ultimately, inhibits replication of the virus. However, this process can be reversed by a reverse transcriptase reaction that removes the chain-terminating residue and reinstates an extendable primer. This reverse reaction of DNA polymerization, termed pyrophosphorolysis, enables reverse transcription and DNA synthesis to resume. Pyrophosphorolysis can be enhanced by key mutations, often referred to as thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). While pyrophosphorolysis is believed to be the primary mechanism of resistance to zidovudine and stavudine, the process is not drug specific in the way that discriminatory mutations tend to be. Consequently, these pyrophosphorolysis-enhancing mutations can confer reduced susceptibility to all of the NRTIs.",

            "text": "Reviewing some recent work in the area of thymidine analogue mutations, a review study results explained that certain TAMs tend to occur together but that others are rarely found together in the same virus. For example, the M41L/L210W/T215Y pathway is a common TAM pattern and is associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine and with cross-resistance to other NRTIs, including tenofovir and abacavir. In contrast, the D67N/K70R/K219Q pathway isolate is a less common TAM pattern and is associated with a lower fold resistance than the M41L/L210W/T215Y cluster. It was also showed that T215F mutation rarely appears in the reverse transcriptase of viruses also harboring the L210W mutation or the M41L mutation (Kuritzkes 2004) and the divergent TAM pathways (Hu et al. 2004). In a nutshell, these studies found that isolates carrying the T215Y mutation replicated more efficiently than isolates harboring the 215F mutation. With incorporation of the L210W mutation into isolates harboring the T215Y mutation, viral fitness was substantially reduced. Conversely, with the incorporation of the K70R mutation into isolates harboring the T215Y mutation, there was a substantial growth advantage in the presence of zidovudine (Hu et al. 2004). Thus, it was concluded that T215Y pathway is more common and confers higher-level resistance to zidovudine and other NRTIs, whereas viruses carrying T215F have lower replication capacity and are poorly fit. With respect to the K70R mutation, it confers a significant advantage to HIV in the presence of zidovudine and that this mutation plays a much larger role in the development of zidovudine resistance than is usually considered (Kuritzkes 2004).",

However, there have been studies suggesting that high-level resistance to lamivudine does not necessarily mean that the drug is rendered worthless. An example of this phenomenon can be found in a clinical trial of partial treatment interruptions conducted by Dr. Steven Deeks and his colleagues (Deeks et al. 2003). This study focused on a cohort of HIV-positive individuals who had a history of excellent treatment adherence, had drug-resistant viremia (greater than 400 copies/ml), and were experiencing a documented treatment-mediated benefit (e.g., a viral load below and CD4+ cell count above pretreatment levels). The patients either stopped their PI(s) or their NRTIs to determine the selective effects of these two drug classes in terms of maintaining the less-fit virus. One more study discontinued lamivudine in four highly treatment-experienced patients with no viable alternative treatment options and evidence of the M184V mutation while on a regimen consisting of at least three antiretrovirals (Campbell et al. 2003). Six weeks after stopping lamivudine, HIV RNA levels increased an average of 0.6 log10 copies/ml above baseline, even though the M184V mutation remained detectable in virus from all patients. This basically showed us that, even in the presence of the M184V mutation, lamivudine was still contributing to HIV RNA suppression. Reversion of M184V to wild type occurred in all four patients between 6 and 14 weeks, accompanied by an additional average increase in viral load of 0.3 log10 copies/ml. Upon resuming lamivudine therapy, the M184V mutation reappeared within 8 weeks in all four patients. The COLATE trial was an open-label trial involving 131 patients experiencing virologic failure while on a lamivudine-containing regimen (Dragsted et al. 2004). In switching to another regimen, approximately half of the patients were randomized to continue lamivudine therapy, with the remaining patients randomized to discontinue lamivudine treatment. Forty-eight weeks later, there were no significant differences between the two groups.",

It also helps in minimizing toxicity and adverse effects by correlating newly found resistance mutations with historical antiretroviral use, which could be of interest to clinicians in planning subsequent antiretroviral regimens for patients who have undergone a range of treatments. If the molecular diagnostic tests can be made less expensive, it will make able to give more imperative therapy against viral disease as AIDS/HIV and hepatitis which are currently giving an enormous economical burden. However, for this to happen, there will need to be major technological improvements in our ability to sequence or screen genomic DNA to assess an individual\u2019s genome in the context of population data. Extensive population-based studies will be required to evaluate the phenotypic significance both acute and long term of genomic variation, at the level of individual variants and combinations of variants. Clinical trials must be carried out with the goal of identifying the outcomes of various combinations of genomic, expression-based, metabolomic, and proteomic data to arrive at complete clinico-genomic profiles predictive of disease risk and drug response. All these efforts jointly open a new ray of hope for a miraculous change in the history of medicine for people suffering from viral diseases.",
