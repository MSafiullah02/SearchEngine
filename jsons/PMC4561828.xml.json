When exposure to harmful antigens occurs, the subsequent interaction with the local and systemic immune system normally ensues in a well-controlled fashion that maintains gut barrier integrity and establishes appropriate immune activation to provide protection from antigen exposure (1, 2). However, immune dysregulation can occur in the intestinal tract, which causes inappropriate stimulation of immune responses that can lead to inflammatory pathologies (1, 3).",

However, cytokine-mediated dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier is observed during the active phase of several inflammatory bowel disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)6 (3). Such disease or stress-related states can cause the tight junction barrier to become defective, allowing increased antigenic penetration into underlying intestinal tissues. This results in increased production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and ILs. This increase in gastrointestinal permeability allows for translocation and subsequent exposure of microbial antigens to lymphocyte populations, which has been implicated in the symptoms associated with IBD (6\u201311). In addition, an evaluation of colonic biopsy samples from patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) found increased numbers of chronic inflammatory cells accompanied by low-grade inflammation (6, 12). Importantly, such patients also have reduced concentrations of aerobic enteric bacteria relative to healthy individuals (13).",

The stress of weaning, the dramatic diet change, the immaturity of the immune system, and exposure to environmental microorganisms create an opportunity for shifts in the microbiome in the days postweaning. In animal models as well as in human studies gastrointestinal infections have been shown to initiate inflammation and increases in gut barrier permeability, allowing for translocation of inflammatory microorganisms and other substances. This circular pathway serves as a mechanism through which damaged gut tissue can lead to chronic enteric or systemic disease.",

Such observations explain the extensive use of PPIs as an animal feed component since the 1980s to improve growth, nutrient utilization, and immunocompetence of domesticated animals (15). The benefits of oral PPIs appear to be related to improvements in intestinal barrier function, microbiota stability, and reductions in gut inflammatory cytokines (14, 16, 17, 21). Many of the studies documenting the benefits of PPIs were conducted in neonatal pigs, which are widely recognized as a leading model to study human nutrition and metabolism, with relevance for agrimedical applications (22). In addition, preliminary clinical studies also demonstrated the safety and utility of dietary supplementation with PPIs in supporting patients with IBS-D (23), HIV-related enteropathy (24), and malnutrition (25, 26). Collectively, these results from both clinical and nonclinical studies indicate that PPI preparations have the potential to provide for distinctive nutritional requirements that are unique to support patients with various forms of intestinal enteropathy (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, IBD, infantile environmental enteropathy, HIV infection).",

As mentioned previously, 2 publications (28, 29) reported on >1 independent experiment (2 each) that used pigs. In these cases, we considered each independent experiment as a separate study and used the data as such in the meta-analysis. As shown in Table 2, 23 of the 29 publications considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis used pigs. However, data from only 10 of these 23 publications could be included in the analysis because 9 studies did not report day 14 data and 10 studies reported no required growth data. The 10 studies that did not report growth study data were used only in selected figures and graphs to describe their study findings. Table 3 presents the disposition of each study that was reviewed for inclusion in this meta-analysis, along with the microbial agents or toxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), which were used in the challenge experiments to induce intestinal infection and inflammation. In total, data from 10 of the 29 studies were included in the analysis (9 studies in pigs, 1 study in turkeys). The same set of outcome measures from each publication was used to collect data. We did not perform any modifications to these outcome measures and used the data as extracted from the articles with 1 exception. Several articles we reviewed listed the SEM from the ANOVA rather than the SD. Therefore, we used the associated sample sizes to derive an estimate of the SD by using the following formula: SD (\u03c3) = SE \u00d7 \u221an. Sample sizes of individual studies varied between 4 and 24, with only 2 of the 11 studies considered having a sample size <10.",

As a standard score it can be compared with the expected weighted sum of squares to yield an estimate of the null and excess variance. A useful property of Q is that it tests the null hypothesis that all studies used in the meta-analysis share a common effect size. Therefore, a significant P value obtained for Q provides evidence that the true effects vary. However, Borenstein et al. (27) suggested that a nonsignificant P value cannot be taken as evidence that the effect sizes are consistent. Several other factors could contribute to a larger P value, such as low power, small number of studies, larger within-study variance, and substantial between-studies variance. In summary, the purpose of the test for Q is to assess the viability of the null hypothesis rather than to provide an estimate of the magnitude of the true variance.",

We believe the use of the Begg-Mazumdar test is more appropriate because this test used rank correlation coefficient rather than the ordinary product moment correlation. Ordinary product moment correlation assumes normal distributions, which are unlikely in these situations. Therefore, considering the Begg-Mazumdar test, it can be seen that the publication bias is not significant for all the variables considered in this meta-analysis. It should be noted that the G:F has low power due to the small sample size and high variability in the results (Table 7).",

All of the literature studies compiled in this meta-analysis used robust, randomized, and controlled designs and used standard statistical principles in the design, conduct, and analysis of these experiments. The effects observed in the 9 pig studies and the 1 study involving turkeys were consistently positive and support the inference that PPIs may produce similar beneficial effects in humans. A key limitation of this study was the need to exclude a number of studies for a variety of reasons and to limit the analysis to studies reporting 14-d results. Studies were excluded because they 1) had multiple diet changes, 2) did not report performance data, or 3) reported data after as little as 7 d or as long as 48 d after treatment with PPIs.

Results from these studies support a role for PPI preparations in maintaining intestinal immune balance, supporting gut barrier function, and improving nutrient absorption, which may have implications for helping the nutritional status of patients with compromised intestinal function due to various disease states.
