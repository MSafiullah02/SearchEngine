The values of collective living of traditional societies that resist modernism will become more controversial. While the speed of individualization which begins with modernism will increase, nation-states might feel themselves under more threat. Groups that have the same sentimental values as religious communities will lose their momentum and they will begin to transform into an individual nature as well. In addition, multi-storey buildings and crowded cities will lose their speed of development, the existing clean water networks and the apartment life where the community lives together will become questionable due to the threat of life safety. As crowded cities will tend to lose their significance achieved after the industrial revolution, cleanliness, health, and hygiene will have a priority in social life. Moreover, both communities and countries might disrupt some democratic values and fundamental human rights; hence, authoritarianism might become widespread by increased security measures. The future of healthcare sector, the personal and professional rights of its professionals, ethic values like physicians right to refuse medical treatment for life-threatening illness or life-sustaining, and also the establishment of hospitals for untreated illness will be among the main issues to be discussed soon but most probably these future planning will cost the world economy.",

Hence, countries' trade amount and speed will be under threat, and countries ensuring the hygiene standard comparing to others will gain a competitive advantage. On the other hand, global viruses will be seen as a threat like a nuclear attack or global terrorism since their impacts on the human and the world are similarly very destructive as seen in the Covid-19. For this reason, countries that could develop a biological defence system or infrastructure for the virus attack will have more power in the world. However, if they will use this power to achieve their national and imperial goals, this will most likely create even more inequality among the countries.",

Economically, if countries hit by sudden and unexpected disease, countries' revenue will drop due to the fall in overall economic activities. The contraction of the economy would begin with the diminishing of the travel and tourism sectors. Then, their widespread effects damage aggregate production and consumption with the layoffs and bankruptcies in all sectors. The unemployment rate rises, and to survive the economy, governments and the central banks must step in by increasing government spending and decreasing interest rates, respectively to increase consumer demand and investments. Nevertheless, estimating the economic costs from a global disease is now ambiguous since the pandemic has spiral effects both on the national and global economy that means any economic shock to one country is quickly spread to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalization [2] . According to the World Bank (WB) report published in 2013, \"\u2026 a severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact, \" and a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or more than $3 trillion [3] . The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) announced that the Covid-19 will likely cost the global economy at least $2 trillion in 2020 [4] .",

Meanwhile, the price war between major oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia continues, and they have continuously increased production to overwhelm global oil markets with supply. The price of something is determined by the interplay of supply and demand but two of the world's biggest oil producers cause a huge unbalance between demand and supply in the oil market. As a result of this, oil prices lost as much as a third of their value since the 1991 Gulf War 5 . In theory, falling oil prices should be good for growth since business costs fall when fuel becomes cheaper and consumers' purchasing power increase for oil-based energy products. However, there is unlikely to be much of fuel demand in the short term due to the wide-ranging travel bans and curfews.",

In the second scenario, increasing layoffs and bankruptcies will feed to a self-reinforcing recession; a comprehensive banking crisis will damage the world financial system, and all fiscal and monetary responses will be insufficient to stop the recession until the second quarter of 2021 [37] .",

According to the twelve leading global thinkers' predictions 15 , the pandemic will change the world forever. They pointed out that this pandemic is a world-shattering event whose far-ranging consequences we can only begin to imagine today. For example, it will strengthen the state, reinforce nationalism, change global economic directions between East and West, and a new stage in globalization will be started by the changing supply chain production strategies.

At first, the notion of a more controlled world would gain wide acceptance and approval. Then, the economic models conducted by authoritarian leaders would increase but authoritarianism greatly would restrict entrepreneurial activity and innovation. Hence, the public would support more restrictions and control mechanisms but this would lead to deteriorations of the fundamental citizens' rights. Moreover, the health and freedom paradigm might be one of the top topics in addition to the security and freedom paradigm in public policy, and authoritarianism and cooperation will be discussed as two opposite approaches to overcome the health crisis in the post-pandemic world.",

The main priority of organizations will be the safety to protect their employees and how to maintain business operations in the postpandemic world. In this context, actions would be taken such as the implementation of a physical mechanism to reduce transmissions like cleaning, staggering shift, and contingency plans for workplace closures. On the other hand, organizations will try to find alternative supply chain actions to respond to the crisis such as transparency on the multi-tier supply chain, optimizing production and distribution capacity, estimating realistic final consumer demand, estimating inventory along the value chain, and finding available logistics capacity [37] .",

In addition, the world will not be the same in the postpandemic era due to the changing sensitivities in the social life or production mechanisms or governance of countries, as stated above.
