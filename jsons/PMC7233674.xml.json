The suspected/confirmed cases should be advised to postpone NM treatment and transferred to designated tertiary hospitals or isolation wards specified for COVID-19 treatment.Patients\u2019 body temperature should be regularly checked and recorded during hospitalization. And patients should be under close observation for unexplained fever, cough, diarrhea, and other symptoms related to the COVID-19 infection. Patients with any of the probable symptoms mentioned above should be immediately quarantined, and in-hospital consultation with the respiratory specialists should be promptly conducted to guild further assessment and treatment.Upon the suspected/confirmed patients\u2019 transference or normal patients\u2019 discharge, the room should undergo appropriate cleaning and disinfection before it is available for routine use [8].Specific instructions on personal hygiene related to COVID-19 should be provided for patients during hospitalization.",

These concerns reflected the deficiency of post-surgical guidance for DTC patients, leading to their poor awareness of the disease status, and underlined the significance of informing and popularization in the post-surgical management of DTC. Therefore, at this critical period, we should not only balance the benefit of NM care and the potential risk of COVID-19 exposures through online platforms, but also prioritize patients who need urgent NM care as per their risk of disease recurrence, which is based on patients\u2019 latest serum biomedical and imaging assessments. Moreover, for the convenience of patients\u2019 access to local NM care, there was also a patient\u2019s location-based counseling which can be easily referred to among online NM experts. All in all, the online counseling platform minimized the potential risk of COVID-19 exposures during patients\u2019 commuting for face-to-face NM inquiries, reassured patients\u2019 access to handy NM resources, further normalized the system of future online NM care for DTC patients, enhanced the collaborations of NM professionals nationwide, and balanced the regional differences of NM resources.",
