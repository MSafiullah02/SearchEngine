However, no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available. Since antiviral activity of some flavonoids is known, we applied a flavonoid library to probe inhibitory compounds against MERS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3-\u03b2-d-glucoside and helichrysetin were found to block the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The binding of the four flavonoids was also confirmed independently using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method.",

The experimental and computational study showed that flavonol and chalcone are favourite scaffolds to bind with the catalytic site of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. It was also deduced that some flavonoid derivatives with hydrophobic or carbohydrate attached to their core structures have a good inhibitory effect. Therefore, we suggest that flavonoids with these characteristics can be used as templates to develop potent MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus coated with viral particles (Fehr & Perlman, 2015) . Together with Arteriviridae and Roniviridae, CoVs belong to the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales. These CoVs can infect a wide variety of hosts, including avian, swine and humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) represent a major group of CoVs associated with various respiratory diseases from common cold to serious pneumonia and bronchitis (Mesel-Lemoine et al., 2012) . Today, HCoVs are recognized as one of the most rapidly evolving viruses originated from their characteristic high genomic nucleotide substitution rates and recombination. In human, their infection is known to cause approximately one-third of common cold. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoVs are highly pathogenic and caused a fatal first major outbreak in 2003 and 2012 , respectively (de Wit, Doremalen, Falzarano, & Munster, 2016 . SARS-and MERS-CoVs genomes contain two open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b translated to two respective viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by host ribosomes. ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). While PLpro cuts the first three cleavage sites of its polyprotein, 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage of the remaining eleven locations resulting in release of a total of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) in both SARS-and MERS-CoVs. The homodimeric form of 3CLpro is active in the presence of substrates. The crystal structure of 3CLpro showed that each monomer is composed of three structural domains: domains I and II form a chymotrypsinlike architecture with catalytic cysteine and are connected to a third C-terminal domain via a long loop (Neddle, Lountos, & Waugh, 2015) . In the proteolytic site, all 3CLpros prefer glutamine at P1 position and leucine, basic residues, small hydrophobic residues at P2, P3 and P4 positions, respectively (Chuck, Chow, Wan, & Wong, 2011) . At P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 positions, small residues are required. Since the autocleavage process is essential for viral propagation, 3CLpro is a good drug target for anti-coronaviral infection. In this study, we used a proteolytic method to probe MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds with a synthetic peptide labelled with the EDANS-DABCYL FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair (Liu et al., 2005) . Since emission wavelengths of EDANS are widely overlapped with absorbance wavelengths of DABCYL, the energy emitted from EDANS will be quenched by DABCYL in a close proximity (10-100 \u00c5). Therefore, an increment of fluorescence can be a sign to judge whether a substrate is cleaved or not in this design. Hence from the fluorescence intensity change, the proteolytic activity of protease could be detected. With a synthetic peptide with the FRET pair, a flavonoid library was screened to search MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds. Recent studies showed that some flavonoids have antiviral activity in some viruses (Frabasile et al., 2017; Juc\u00e1 et al.,2018; Kiat et al., 2006; Yang, Lin, Zhou, Liu, & Zhu, 2017; Zakaryan, Arabyan, Oo, & Zandi, 2017) . Therefore, we assayed flavonoids and tried to induce their structural property crucial to bind with MERS-CoV 3CLpro.",

NC_019843.3) was synthesized chemically by Bioneer and cloned into a bacteriophage T7-based expression vector. The plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 150 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Several colonies were picked and grown in capped test-tubes with 10 ml LB broth containing 150 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. A cell stock composed of 0.85 ml culture and 0.15 ml glycerol was prepared and frozen at 193 K for use in a large culture. The frozen cell stock was grown in 5 ml LB medium and diluted into 2,000 ml fresh LB medium. The culture was incubated at 310 K with shaking until an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 was reached. At this point, expression of MERS-CoV 3CLpro was induced using isopropyl-\u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was further grown at 310 K for 3 hr in a shaking incubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,650 g (6,500 rev min \u22121 ) for 10 min in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge at 277 K. The cultured cell paste was resuspended in 25 ml of a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 10 \u03bcg/ml DNase I.

This substrate contains the nsp4/nsp5 cleavage sequence, GVLQ\u2193SG (Wua et al., 2015) , and works as a generic peptide substrate for many coronavirus including MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The peptide was dissolved in distilled water and incubated with each protease. A SpectraMax i3x Multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) was used to measure spectral-based fluorescence. The proteolytic activity was determined at 310 K by following the increase in fluorescence (\u03bb excitation = 340 nm, \u03bb emission = 490 nm, bandwidths = 9, 15 nm, respectively) of EDANS upon peptide hydrolysis as a function of time. Assays were conducted in black, 96-well plates (Nunc) in 350 \u03bcl assay buffers containing protease and substrate as follows: for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro assay, 1.84 \u03bcl of 0.19 mM protease containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 was incubated with 8.75 \u03bcl of 0.1 mM substrate at 310 K for 2 hr before measuring Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU). Before the assay, the emission spectra of 40 flavonoids were surveyed after illuminating at 340 nm to avoid the overlapping with the emission spectrum of EDANS. Every compound was suitable to be tested. The final concentration of the protease, peptide and chemical used at the assay was 1, 2.5 and 20 \u03bcM each. At first, MERS-CoV 3CLpro and chemical were mixed and preincubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate, and each well was incubated at 310 K for 2 hr. After 2 hr, we measured the fluorescence of the mixture on the black 96-well plate using the end-point mode of SpectraMax i3x where the excitation wavelength was fixed to 340 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 490 nm using 9, 15 nm bandwidth, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Among the first forty flavonoids (Table S1 ), four of them were picked up to further assay at a concentration range of 2 \u03bcM-320 \u03bcM. IC50 value which is the value causing 50% inhibition of catalytic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro was calculated by non-linear regression analysis using graphpad prism 7.03 (GraphPad Software).",

Ionizer was used to generate ionized state of all compounds at target pH 7.0 \u00b1 2.0. This prepared low-energy conformers of the ligand were taken as the input for docking analysis. Grids for molecular docking were built using Receptor Grid Generation. Compounds were docked using Ligand Docking mode with postdocking minimization including 5 poses per ligand. The docked poses were then refined using an XP (extra precision) option with the threshold value for rejecting minimized pose of 0.5 kcal/mol. The energies were calculated using the OPLS3 force field.",

Tryptophan was well-known to emit its own fluorescence. Therefore, if tryptophan is positioned adequately in proteins, the change in fluorescence intensity can reflect the binding state of chemicals and be used to judge interaction between proteins and chemicals. MERS-CoV 3CLpro contains five tryptophan residues and thus displays a high fluorescence peak at 340 nm at the tryptophan excitation wavelength of 295 nm. We monitored the change in the fluorescence intensities of MERS-CoV 3CLpro depending on the presence or absence of four chemicals. Since each compound in the flavonoid library was almost non-fluorescent under the experiment condition, a change in fluorescence intensity reflects interactions between MERS-CoV 3CLpro and chemicals. Only the four inhibitory compounds obviously reduced the fluorescence intensity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro (Figure 3) . The decreased emission intensity confirmed the complex formation between MERS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibitory compounds. In order to deduce the binding modes of the inhibitory flavonoids, an in-depth theoretical investigation through an induced-fit docking study was carried out. The interactions between MERS-CoV 3CLpro and the inhibitory flavonoids were analysed to predict their binding affinities. Top ranked structures (according to the glide scores) from the induced-fit docking results for herbacetin (\u221210.246), isobavachalcone (\u22129.364), quercetin 3-\u03b2-d-glucoside (\u22129.751) and helichrysetin (\u22129.953) were selected and hypothesized to be biological complexes.

The immediate inference of the primary scaffold required for binding with MERS-CoV 3CLpro was as follows: first, the orientation of the aromatic ring B at the position C-2 of ring C is essential as shown in isoflavones and isoflavane. Second, the saturated heteroatomic ring C is not preferred as shown in flavanols and flavanones. Third, chalcone and flavonol scaffolds show a promising binding property.",

Helichrysetin is a chalcone derivative (Van Puyvelde et al., 1989) . Therefore, we compared its inhibitory activity with a chalcone, cardamonin (2\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy-6\u2032-methoxychalcone) which is the structurally identical homologue except one hydroxyl group at the 4-position of the benzyl moiety of chalcone. The inhibitory activity of cardamonin at the concentration of 40 \u03bcM was lower than that of helichrysetin ( Figure 4 ). It implies that the 4-hydroxyl group of helichrysetin is functionally important to bind with MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The structural comparison of cardamonin with isobavachalcone also indicated the modification effect of acetophenone ring of chalcone: the hydrophobic modification at the 3\u2032-position of the acetophenone ring moiety of isobavachalcone improves its binding affinity to MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Intriguingly, the docking study shows that the 4-hydroxyl group of helichrysetin forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr54 of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Since Tyr54 is located deep inside of the hydrophobic S2 site, helichrysetin is inserted into deeper than cardamonin ( Figure S3a ). As a result, helichrysetin seems to have a better affinity and thus represents a better inhibitory activity.",

The better inhibitory activity of quercetin 3-\u03b2-d-glucoside means that hydroxymethyl is preferred to hydroxide in this position of the glucoside to interact with MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The docking study represents that the hydroxymethyl group of the glucoside moiety makes a hydrogen bond with Glu169 and thus contributes its tighter binding to the S1 site than the rhamnoside moiety of quercitrin ( Figure S3d ).",

Chalcone has immunomodulation, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and anti-diabetic activities (Yadav, Prasad, Sung, & Aggarwal, 2011) . Recently, the non-competitive inhibition of cardamonin against the dengue virus protease has been reported (Kiat et al., 2006) . As discussed above, cardamonin is a strong homologue of helichrysetin. The analysis of the crystal structures of three viral proteases, MERS-CoV 3CLpro, dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease and norovirus 3CLpro were performed, and their active sites were compared ( Figure S4 ) (Erbel et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2005) . Despite their sequential divergence, their overall architecture resembles each other. Furthermore, the spatial positions of their catalytic residues were also highly conserved. The observation implies that chalcone and flavonol can be used as templates to develop a potential antiviral agent by targeting these viral proteases.",

Therefore, one of antiviral mechanisms of flavonoids may be originated from their direct binding capability to viral proteases. Consequently, flavonoid derivatives can be used as a template to design not only for broad-spectrum but also for virus-specific antiviral agents. A further study is going on to develop better inhibitory lead compounds derived from this study.",

We found four flavonoids effectively reducing the proteolytic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The binding of the flavonoids was independently proven by a tryptophanbased fluorescence method. The assay in the presence of Triton X-100 also eliminated the chance of the false-positive result from the aggregation of flavonoids. The analysis of the four compounds with their homologs using an induced-fit docking study provided an insight of flavonoid scaffolds required to bind with MERS-CoV 3CLpro. The prominent activity of helichrysetin and isobavachalcone indicates that the flexibility of the chalcone scaffold is good to bind with MERS-CoV 3CLpro. In contrast, the comparable activity of flavones with a rigid \u03b3-pyrone ring indicates that their spatial rearrangement together with various functional groups may be an alternative strategy to interact with MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, this study suggests that an antiviral effect of some flavonoids is directly from their structural characteristics binding to viral proteases.",
