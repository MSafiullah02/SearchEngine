Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.",

In addition, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [3, 4] . Like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can also cause severe respiratory illness and even death. Moreover, the population's susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events, highlighting the necessity to prepare for the future emerging viruses [5] .",

The initial patient cluster with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported as pneumonia with unknown aetiology, which bore some resemblance to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [7] . To date the severity of SARS-CoV-2 has tended to be mild, the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases was 4.3% in a single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients [8] , and the infection fatality risk could be below 1% or even below 0.1% in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections [9] . However, the basic reproduction number (R0) of person-to-person spread was about 2.6, which meant that the cases of infection would grow at an exponential rate. As of 7 February, 2020, 57,620 cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, including 26,359 suspected cases, and a sustained increase is predicted. It is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences of the information available to date. Since no specific antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently available, supportive cares, including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most important management strategy, especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome [4, 10] . Currently, there is no special antiviral treatment or vaccine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f against the new virus. Therefore, it is of great importance to research and develop effective and safe antiviral drugs.",

Therefore, it is significantly to study the traditional Chinese medicines that have obvious advantages in the treatment of the new virus. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat influenza, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and mumps for more than a century [14] . It consists of Bezoar (the gall-stone of Bos taurus domesticus Gmelin), Musk (the excretion of Moschus), cinobufagin venom toad (the excretion of Venenum Bufonis), pearl (the shell of Pernulo), realgar, and borneol. In previous studies, it was shown that the LS exhibited a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, analgesic, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory activities [15, 16] . In addition, LS could inhibit viral propagation and regulate immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with oseltamivir in reducing the course of H1N1 virus infection. Notably, the anti-influenza activity of LS in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines, particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 [17] . However, there is no exact evidence that LS is effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanisms of action remain obscure. Therefore, to study the antiviral activity of LS on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response, we evaluated the antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficiency of LS against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 from Guangzhou in vitro.",

Therefore, effective and safe antiviral agents are urgently needed. Currently, the use of TCM is a popular and acceptable therapy, and many TCM prescriptions have been proven to have obvious therapeutic LS is a TCM used to treat tonsillitis, influenza, pharyngitis, and mumps. However, the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of LS in treating viral pneumonia are less understood.

The results showed that LS was able to protect cells from virus-induced cell death and inhibit the average size and plaque number in LS-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. The SI index of LS reached 8.18 (Table 1 ). All these results confirmed that LS might be a potential antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2. TEM has been a potent tool to observe virus entry, virus particle assembly, viral ultrastructure, and budding from the plasma membrane [31] . To understand the antiviral details of LS, TEM images were taken from each group It is reported that highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause fatal pneumonia, which is mainly associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses. Although the pathophysiology of fatal pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses has not been completely understood, recent studies suggest a crucial role of cytokine storm in causing fatal pneumonia [32] . Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL-10/IP-10, and CCL-2/MCP-1) in the serum of SARS patients [33] , which was similar to the serum patients with MERS with increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15, and IL-17) [34] . It also reported that the expression of the cytokine storm in the NCIP patients in ICU than those in non-ICU patients [7] .

SARS-CoV-2 caused a severe CPE in Vero E6-infected cells, including cell rounding, detachment and death. A reduction in SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE after 72 h incubation indicated the antiviral activity of LS and Remdesivir.
