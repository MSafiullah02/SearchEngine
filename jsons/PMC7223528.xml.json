A small amount of milk (usually 0.2 mL divided into two cheeks) is placed on the mucous membrane of the mouth for absorption. Sterile cotton swabs or oral applicators are used for each application of human milk.17 Colostrum contacts the mouth and oropharyngeal pouch and produces immune protection and stimulation of oropharyngeal receptors by the abundant anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines detected in the mother\u2019s colostrum and milk.

Although we would like to extract more data on mechanical ventilation for deeper discussion, the lack of raw data in the article is our main difficulty, and it appears that most articles have not shifted their focus to the benefits of oral colostrum in premature infants with mechanical ventilation. Thibeau\u2019s study,15 which we excluded because it is a retrospective study, directly investigated human milk and mechanical ventilation-related pneumonia, and there were no statistically significant differences. Since this study is not an RCT, the evidence is not very strong. Thus, we expect that more RCTs will be conducted on the relationship between VAP and colostrum.",

In our meta-analysis, we found that intervention with OC can potentially reduce the occurrence of NEC (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.26\u20130.99, P = 0.05). The p value is exactly equal to 0.05, and the confidence interval of the OR did not include 1, so we considered the result as potentially statistically significant. Although the pathophysiology of NEC is still not completely understood, recent research shows that maternal IgA protects against the development of NEC in preterm infants.37 Colostrum is rich in immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM, and lactoferrin), of which SIgA is the highest in all exocrine fluids.10 This also reasonably explains our results. Although the incidence of NEC was not statistically significant in the eight articles included, it was observed that the intervention group had a slight downward trend in each study, which may also be the reason for our potential statistical significance. Hence, we still need larger sample sizes of RCTs to continue to confirm the preventive effect of OC.",

            "text": "However, the incidence of sepsis, an immune-related high-risk neonatal disease (proven sepsis, clinical sepsis, and late-onset sepsis), was not statistically significant. We believe there are two possible reasons: first, Moreno\u2019s study21 suggested that the sIgA of the colostrum group continued to increase over the 30 days of the observation period and was higher than that of the control group, while the lactoferrin content decreased after reaching its peak at 15 days. This reveals that the stimulating effect of colostrum on lactoferrin is not persistent. Previous studies revealed that low neonatal IgA levels were a risk factor for VAP,38 and lactoferrin levels were associated with sepsis.39 This can explain why in this meta-analysis, the occurrence of VAP was statistically significant, and sepsis only displayed a downward trend. Second, colostrum contact between the oropharyngeal mucosa and this fluid may have immunomodulatory effects resulting in a decrease in inflammation. The non-statistical significance of colostrum administration for sepsis may indicate that colostrum has an upregulating effect on the immune function of newborns, but may overexaggerate the downregulatory ability of inflammation. In this regard, colostrum administration may facilitate the prevention of VAP. Although we just found that OC was associated with a trend toward downregulating proven sepsis, we believe that low birth weight infants with proven sepsis may benefit from OC, so we hope that future studies will pay more attention to this part of the population and finally obtain a more certain answer.",

In addition, the present study showed that OC was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of VAP, which no previous meta-analysis has reported before. The lung and immune system of VLBW infants are immature, and a longer mechanical ventilation time will lead to higher VAP incidence, followed by higher mortality and a longer hospital stay.
