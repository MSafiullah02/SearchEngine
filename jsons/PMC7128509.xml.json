Due to its high contagiousness and aggressive course, it has been declared by World Health Organization (WHO) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (A public health emergency, 2019). The course of the disease is often mild, undistinguishable from a common flu, but in a considerable number of cases may require hospitalization, eventually leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.",

Starting from the end of February 2020, contagious has rapidly spread in Italy, particularly in the North (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna), apparently sparing central and southern regions. After a delay of a few days, Covid-19 is now widely diffuse in many other European countries, particularly Spain and Germany, nevertheless with evident international dissimilarities which cannot be explained only by different health policies and systems. In particular, since the virus began to spread in Italy, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna recorded a substantial high level of lethality if compared with other countries but also than other Italian regions. Despite the difficulty in assessing the reasons of such differences in the middle of this enormous health emergency, researchers all around the world have linked this unexpected surplus of lethality in North Italy with two main co-factors i) the different way to report the number of deaths and infects among countries; ii) the old age of Italian population. Few or no hypothesis have identified the atmospheric pollution as potential and additional co-factor of lethality. Although a study conducted by Sima (http://www.simaonlus.it/w, 2020) has showed that pollution has played a key role in the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 there is no evidence about if pollution may have had an impact on communities exposed to toxic air in terms of worsening of initial health status in order to be considered an additional co-factor of SARS-CoV-2 lethality.",

A team of researchers at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute by using data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA\u2019s Aura satellite, revealed that Northern Italy is one of Europe\u2019s most polluted areas in terms of smog and air pollution also due to its climatic and geographic conditions, which cause the stagnation of pollutants (Earth Observatory. A, 1590). The European Environment Agency (EEA) has recently introduced an aggregated index named as Air Quality Index (AQI), index reflecting the potential impact of air quality on health, driven by the pollutants in geographical regions. It is calculated hourly for more than two thousand air quality monitoring stations across Europe, using up-to-date data reported by EEA member countries (European Air Quality Inde). The AQI is based on concentration values for up to five key pollutants, including: PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2 and NO2. According to the AQI the area covering Lombardia and Emilia Romagna results to be the most polluted area in Italy (and one of the most polluted in Europe) (Indice di qualit\u00e1 dell\u2019ar).

Regardless of the etiology (Aisiku et al., 2016), a hyper-activation of immune innate system is thought to have a paramount role in this condition: inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IL-18, as well as several growth factors, are overexpressed in ARDS, triggering apoptotic cascade and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Gouda et al., 2018). Moreover, their high serum and bronchoalveolar lavage level seem related to a poorer prognosis (Butt et al., 2016). These findings, although not validated and not available in the common clinical practice, make them suitable as potential biomarkers and targets for the therapy.",

Recently published papers have found an imbalance in T cells, as well as high serum levels of IL-6, IL-1 and TNF\u03b1 (Qin et al., 2020), in the subjects requiring hospitalization and admitted to ICU: this suggests an intriguing role of the most recent immunosuppressive drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 (Stebbing et al., 2020).

Obviously, a high systemic inflammation impairs heart function too, as witnessed in another cohort of mice exposed to PM2.5 and PM10 (Radan et al., 2019). All these findings have been extensively confirmed in humans too: both PM2.5 and PM10 lead to systemic inflammation with an overexpression of PDGF, VEGF, TNF\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 even in healthy, non-smoker and young subjects (Pope et al., 2016), directly related to the length of the exposure to the pollutant (Tsai et al., 2019).",

Such evidences are remarked by a more recent paper, which investigated the effects of Milan city (Lombardy, Italy) winter PM2.5 and summer PM10: as expected, human bronchial cells evidenced an in vitro elevated production of both IL-6 and IL-8 (Longhin et al., 2018).

Moreover, as we previously pointed out, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects.",

Among elderly living in such a region and affected by other comorbidities, the cilia and upper airways defenses could have been weakened both by age and chronic exposure to air pollution, which, in turn, could facilitate virus invasion by allowing virus reaching lower airways. Subsequently, a dysregulated, weak immune system, triggered by chronic air pollution exposure may lead to ARDS and eventually death, particularly in case of severe respiratory and cardiovascular comorbidities. Moreover, since the prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution could induce persistent modifications of the immune system (Tsai et al., 2019), short-term changes in the air quality may not be sufficient to break this vicious circle. This might be supported by the persistent high fatality rate, despite the dramatical reduction of air pollution levels in Lombardy since the start of the outbreak. Obviously, our considerations must not let us neglect other critical factors responsible for the high contagiousness and fatality of this rapidly spreading disease. Important factors such as the age structure of the affected population, the wide differences among Italian regional health systems, capacity of the intensive care units in the region, and the prevention policies taken by the Government have had a paramount role in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, presumably more than the air pollution itself. At the same time, our paper evaluated fatality rate only in two Italian regions: given the pandemic dimension of Covid-19, it will be interesting to evaluate if, similarly, a higher lethality will be also recorded in the most polluted regions worldwide.",
