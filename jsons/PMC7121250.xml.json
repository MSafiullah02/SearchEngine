There are several important anatomical differences between pediatric and adult patients that render children more susceptible to acute airway obstruction. In addition, there are several diseases that can cause life-threatening acute airway compromise. An understanding of the developmental anatomy and physiology, as well as the myriad diseases that can cause airway compromise in children is therefore essential for all healthcare personnel that provide care for critically ill children.",

The upper respiratory tract begins with the nasal and oral cavities, which together comprise the pharynx. The pharynx is connected to the esophagus and the larynx. The larynx and its unique anatomy continue into the chest in the form of a cylindrical structure called the trachea. The larynx is a unique structure whose primary functions are in speech production and protection of the airway. It is formed by cartilaginous, bony, and connective tissue structures. The glottis is the area around the vocal cords. The subglottis is the area directly below the vocal cords leading into the trachea. The cords are closed during the end of the expiratory phase, and they open at the beginning of the inspiratory phase. The trachea is a cylindrical structure formed by 16\u201320 U-shaped cartilaginous rings and a muscular/cartilaginous part that completes the tube.",

These affect both mask ventilation and tracheal intubation. In the neonate and infant, important anatomic differences include a proportionately larger head and tongue, narrower nasal passages, an anterior and cephalad larynx, long epiglottis, and a short trachea and neck. These factors contribute to making infants \u201cobligate\u201d nasal breathers. The cricoid cartilage is the narrowest point of the airway in children younger than 10 years of age as opposed to the glottis in the adult. Even minimal edema will have a proportionately greater effect in children because of their smaller tracheal diameters. In older children, prominent adenoidal and tonsillar tissue can obstruct visualization of the larynx. Also, there are specific congenital anatomic airway anomalies that occur in children which makes management of the airway even more complex. As the child becomes older the airway becomes more comparable to the adult anatomy, and by 8 or 9 years of age the airway is considered similar to the adult airway, with the exception of the size of the airway itself.\n",

Any process that narrows the airway further will cause an exponential rise in airway resistance and hence a significant increase in the work of breathing.

The tongue of infants and small children dominates the overall capacitance of the oropharynx, so any pediatric patient who presents with altered mental status will be at risk for the development of upper airway obstruction secondary to loss of muscle tone affecting the tongue. Occlusion of the oropharynx by the tongue is not uncommon in this setting, but tilting of the head, lifting the chin, or insertion of an oral airway may correct this obstruction (the so-called triple airway maneuver).",

            "text": "The pediatric airway is highly compliant and the cartilaginous support less well-developed compared to the adult airway and is therefore more susceptible to dynamic airway collapse in the presence of airway obstruction. The normal respiratory dynamics change significantly in the presence of airway obstruction (Fig. 2.2). A forced inhalation that is required to generate airflow in the presence of a partial upper airway obstruction requires a stronger contraction of the diaphragm and respiratory muscles, generating a greater decrease (i.e. more negative relative to atmospheric pressure) in intra-pleural and intra-luminal airway pressures. The larger gradient between atmospheric pressure and the airway pressure leads to dynamic collapse of the extrathoracic trachea just beyond the level of obstruction. This explains why obstruction of the extrathoracic airway is worse during inspiration (Fig. 2.3). Conversely, lower airway or intrathoracic airway obstruction (e.g. aspirated foreign body, asthma, bronchiolitis, etc) results in a ball-valve effect and subsequent air-trapping. Increased respiratory effort during exhalation is required, generating an increase in intra-pleural pressures and leading to dynamic compression of the intrathoracic airways. This explains why obstruction of the intrathoracic airways is worse during expiration (Fig. 2.4).\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "The movement of a gas (i.e. air) through a partially closed, collapsible tube (i.e. airway) obeys the laws of physics. According to the Venturi effect, the pressure exerted by a gas (i.e. air) as it flows through a partially closed tube is equal in all directions except when there is linear movement, which creates additional pressure in the forward vector with a corresponding fall in the lateral vectors. This decrease in lateral pressure (i.e. the distending pressure keeping the collapsible tube open) causes the tube to narrow, leading to partial obstruction. In addition, according to the Bernoulli principle, the velocity of a gas increases as it flows through a partially obstructed tube, creating an additional decrease in intraluminal pressure and further exacerbating the obstruction (Fig. 2.5). This pattern of intermittent flow produces audible sounds that are characterized (depending upon the level of partial obstruction) as stertor, gurgling, stridor, wheezes, rhonchi, and rales. For example, stretor is a snoring or snorting sound that is produced by turbulence within the nasopharynx. Gurgling is produced by turbulence within the oropharynx due to the mixture of air and secretions. Stridor is the sound produced by turbulent airflow in a partially obstructed trachea, either due to intrinsic obstruction or extrinsic compression [1, 2, 8\u201314].\n\n",

Therefore, increasing the length of the airway (L), increasing the viscosity of the air (\u03b7), or decreasing the radius of the airway will reduce laminar air flow. Changing the airway radius, however, has the greatest effect on flow. Hagen-Poiseuille\u2019s law holds for conditions of laminar flow. Laminar flow is highly organized, streamlined, and efficient. Turbulent flow, on the other hand, is highly disorganized, chaotic, and inefficient (Fig. 2.6). Laminar flow is typically found in the peripheral airways, while turbulent flow is found in the proximal, upper airways. Importantly, the Poiseuille\u2019s law assumes conditions of laminar flow. When turbulent flow is present, as occurs during partial airway obstruction, airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the airway to the fifth power! The Reynolds number can be used to determine whether conditions favor laminar versus turbulent flow. It is calculated by the following equation:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ Re=2 Vr\\rho /\\eta $$\n\\end{document}Re=2Vr\u03c1/\u03b7\nWhere Re is the Reynolds number, V is the velocity of flow of air, r is the radius of the airway, \u03b7 is the viscosity of the air, and \u03c1 is the density of the air. Laminar flow is favored when the Reynolds number is less than 2,000, while turbulent flow is favored when the Reynolds number is greater than 4,000. In other words, the higher the Reynolds number, the more likely turbulent flow is present. As such, higher velocities (such as occurs during crying, coughing, agitation, or respiratory distress), larger caliber airways, lower air density, and lower air viscosity all favor turbulent flow [15, 16].\n\n",

Partial obstruction of the intrathoracic, subglottic airway, on the other hand, usually manifests as biphasic (inspiratory AND expiratory) stridor. Changes in the severity of stridor may suggest the presence of an expanding lesion, such as a papilloma or congenital cyst.

When airflow is turbulent (e.g., during crying) resistance to airflow is inversely proportional to the fifth power of radius such that even a minor reduction in the cross-sectional area of the airway will result in a marked increase in airflow resistance and work of breathing. For these reasons, the infant or child with airway obstruction should be kept calm and as quiet as possible to prevent generation of turbulent airflow, increased airway resistance, and worsening respiratory distress. In general, any child in severe respiratory distress will assume a position that maximizes oxygenation and ventilation and should be allowed to remain in this position of comfort. For example, the child with supraglottitis will sit erect with the head tilted forward in the sniffing position, whereas a child with a retropharyngeal abscess will assume a head tilt or opisthotonus posture because of spasm of the muscles supporting the cervical spine [1, 2, 8, 9].",

Croup primarily affects children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years with a peak incidence between 1 to 2 years of age. While sporadic cases may be seen throughout the year, the peak incidence occurs during early fall and winter. Males are affected slightly more commonly than females [17\u201321]. Croup is caused by an inflammation affecting the subglottic tissues, occasionally affecting the tracheobronchial tree as well, usually due to a viral infection. Croup is most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus type 1, though parainfluenza virus types 2 and 3, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are commonly implicated as well [21\u201325].",

Children with croup typically present with several days of viral prodromal symptoms (cough, coryza, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever) with progressively worsening hoarseness, the classic \u201cseal-like\u201d or barky cough, and stridor (most commonly inspiratory in nature, though biphasic stridor is indicative of more severe degree of airway obstruction). The absence of drooling (i.e. dysphagia and inability to handle oral secretions) can help differentiate children with croup from those with a more serious bacterial illness, such as supraglottitis. Conversely, children with high fevers, drooling, absence of a cough, and/or a toxic appearance are more likely to have a more serious infection such as bacterial tracheitis, retropharyngeal abscess, or supraglottitis [29]. The classic harsh cough or bark may progress to inspiratory stridor and frank dyspnea in severe cases, and various scales have been devised to quantify the severity of stridor and document the progression of the illness and subsequent response to therapy [30\u201333].",

In addition, recent studies suggest that continuous cool mist therapy is not effective for croup [40, 41]. Nebulized racemic epinephrine rapidly reduces airway edema and improves symptoms, though the effect is transient and disappears within 2\u20133 h of administration [32, 42\u201348]. Both the racemic and L-isomer form of epinephrine appear to be safe and effective, however racemic epinephrine has not been shown to decrease the need for either tracheal intubation or tracheotomy in children with croup [42, 44, 45]. Rebound or worsening of airway obstruction after the drug effect wears off may occur with the use of racemic epinephrine, and for this reason, treated patients should be observed for 4\u20136 h after administration [48].",

Administration of corticosteroids appears to improve symptomatology, shorten the duration of hospital stay, and reduce the need for racemic epinephrine [26, 46, 49\u201355]. A single dose of dexamethasone is usually adequate for mild to moderate croup. The dose of dexamethasone ranges from 0.15 mg/kg of oral preparation to 0.6 mg/kg of parenteral preparation. Nebulized corticosteroids appear to be effective as well, especially when administered in combination with racemic epinephrine [46, 55\u201362]. Children with severe croup who are managed in the PICU setting may require a more prolonged course of corticosteroids. Although few adequately controlled, randomized studies exist to suggest any benefit to prolonged administration of corticosteroids in critically ill children with acute respiratory failure secondary to croup, the wealth of anecdotal experience would suggest this to be a reasonable practice. Corticosteroids appear to be advantageous in relieving upper airway obstruction regardless of the route of administration [63\u201366]. While the precise mechanism of action of corticosteroids in croup is not readily known, the rapid response observed following corticosteroid administration suggests that decreased capillary permeability and peripheral vasoconstriction plays an important role [63]. The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids (via inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression) require 6\u201312 h for maximal effect [63\u201366].",

            "text": "The use of helium-oxygen mixtures may be beneficial in some children with croup. Helium-oxygen mixtures create conditions that favor laminar flow as opposed to turbulent flow. Recall that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the airway radius to the fifth power (r5) under conditions of turbulent air flow (versus airway radius to the fourth power when laminar flow is present). Helium is a colorless, odorless gas with the lowest density of any gas except hydrogen. In addition, helium is more viscous than ambient air. As such, helium will reduce the Reynolds number and change a turbulent flow pattern to a laminar flow pattern, resulting in lower airway resistance and improved bulk flow [15, 16, 67]. Helium-oxygen gas (Heliox) mixtures have been shown to improve the work of breathing and gas exchange in children with croup [67\u201379]. Heliox has few side effects and is easy to administer by face mask, hood, high-flow nasal cannula, or via a tracheal tube in children on mechanical ventilatory support [74]. In order to minimize the risk of asphyxia secondary to administration of 100 % helium, helium-oxygen mixtures should only be administered from pre-mixed helium-oxygen cylinders. Currently, 80:20 helium-oxygen and 70:30 helium:oxygen mixtures are available. Therefore, children with a high oxygen requirement are unlikely to benefit (and may actually worsen) from heliox administration. The beneficial effects of helium are reduced with lower ratios of helium-to-oxygen, though it appears likely that helium will have at least some therapeutic value even at low concentrations [16, 68, 75].",

Prior to the introduction of corticosteroid therapy, tracheal intubation was required in approximately 2 % of children hospitalized with croup [8, 17\u201319]. Tracheal intubation is now commonly limited to those children who either have pre-existing airway abnormalities or who have been tracheally intubated in an outside facility prior to transfer. Generally, tracheal intubation with a tube smaller than what would be normally predicted for age and weight should be used in the minority of children requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. Extubation can usually be accomplished within 2\u20133 days once an air leak has developed around the tracheal tube. Bronchoscopy is reserved for children who fail to develop an air leak after 7 days, or in children less than 6 months of age, who have a high likelihood of congenital malformations of the airway [8, 17\u201319]. Although the etiologies of many infections of upper respiratory tract are viral, bacterial superinfection may occur. However, uncomplicated croup is viral in origin and should not be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy may be considered in those children who fail to improve or who require tracheal intubation.",

Supraglottitis is perhaps more appropriate for this reason and classically affects children between the age of 2 and 8 years [8, 17\u201319]. Historically, supraglottitis was most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS), and Staphylococcus aureus are reported more commonly in the post-Hib vaccination era [80\u201386]. Since the development and widespread use of the conjugated HIB vaccine, there has been a significant decrease in the incidence of supraglottitis. The incidence of supraglottitis in children <5 years of age has decreased from 41 cases per 100,000 in 1987 to 1.3 cases per 100,000 in 1997 [87]. The incidence of supraglottitis appears to have stabilized at around 1.3 cases per 100,000 children, primarily due to low or incomplete vaccination coverage in localized populations, as well as cases of supraglottitis caused by microorganisms other than Haemophilus influenzae type b [88].",

By the time that affected children present for medical attention, they are generally toxic and have inspiratory stridor [8, 17\u201319].

Excessive manipulation of the child and his airway should be avoided to minimize the risk of acute exacerbation of airway obstruction. The appearance on a lateral neck radiograph obtained with hyperextension of the neck is classic (Fig. 2.8), though diagnosis is usually confirmed by direct inspection of the airway in the operating room. When a diagnosis of supraglottitis is entertained based upon initial history and physical examination, the child should be accompanied by a physician skilled in airway management to the operating room. The child should be allowed to remain in his or her \u201cposition of comfort\u201d and all anxiety-provoking procedures (e.g. phlebotomy, oral examination, etc) should be deferred. Direct laryngoscopy under anesthesia should be performed while maintaining spontaneous breathing [8, 17\u201319, 91\u201394]. Cultures of the supraglottic region should be obtained, and the trachea should be intubated. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against \u03b2-lactamase-producing microorganisms is initiated once cultures have been obtained (e.g. a second- or third-generation cephalosporin such as cefuroxime or ceftriaxone, or alternatively, ampicillin/sulbactam) [8, 17\u201319, 95, 96]. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the pathogenic organism, and the duration of antibiotic therapy is determined by the clinical response. Generally, symptomatic improvement and the development of an audible air leak around the tracheal tube occurs within 24\u201348 h [97]. Despite the virtual elimination of invasive HIB infection, it is important for pediatric intensivists to understand the management issues surrounding patients with supraglottitis to avoid disastrous outcomes.\n\n",

It is characterized by thick, mucopurulent, membranous tracheal secretions that do not clear with cough, which have the potential to occlude the airway. Bacterial tracheitis is more insidious compared to supraglottitis and affects children between the ages of 6 months and 8 years with a peak incidence during fall and winter [8, 17\u201319, 102\u2013104]. Children frequently present with a viral prodrome of several days duration, accompanied by low-grade fever, cough, and stridor (similar to croup). The viral prodrome is followed by rapid clinical deterioration characterized by a high fever and upper airway obstruction. Affected children are more toxic in appearance compared to children with croup. Radiographic examination often is indistinguishable from that of croup (steeple sign), and in fact, the noted similarities between these two disorders have led some authors to suggest that bacterial tracheitis represents a bacterial superinfection of croup.",

Infection with the parainfluenza virus has been implicated as the prodromal infection in many cases, further lending credence to the suggestion that bacterial tracheitis represents a bacterial superinfection of croup. Children with bacterial tracheitis are managed using the epiglottis management algorithm described above [107, 111]. Direct inspection of the airway under anesthesia should be performed in the operating room, and usually reveals subglottic edema with ulcerations, erythema, and pseudomembrane formation in the trachea. Removal of pseudomembranes and dead tissue from the airway at diagnosis, tracheal intubation, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, directed against staphylococcal and streptococcal species are the cornerstone of treatment. Empiric therapy should be broadly directed against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms until culture results are available. Staphylococcal coverage is of obvious importance. Anaerobic organisms may be treated with clindamycin. Extubation may be attempted following clinical improvement and the development of an air leak around the tracheal tube, usually within 3\u20135 days [8, 17\u201319, 107, 111].",

The retropharyngeal space is comprised of a loose network of connective tissue and lymph nodes that drain the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, middle ear, teeth, and facial bones. Infection and abscess formation in this area generally result from lymphatic spread of infection or direct spread from the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, or middle ear. These lymph nodes atrophy during early childhood, thereby decreasing the risk of disease in older children and adolescents [8, 17\u201319, 114\u2013116]. For this reason, trauma (e.g. from placing a pencil or stick in the mouth) and foreign body ingestion account for the majority of cases in older children and adolescents. Most cases of retropharyngeal abscess occur in children less than 5 years of age, so there is a significant overlap in the affected age range compared to supraglottitis and bacterial tracheitis [8, 17\u201319].",

Tachycardia, bronchospasm, urticaria and a \u201cfeeling of impending doom\u201d are other features suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction. Respiratory distress is secondary to edema of the larynx, trachea, and even hypopharynx. The type 1 reaction may also lead to a \u201clate\u201d allergic response causing airway obstruction that appears several hours after exposure to the allergen, such as food or medications. Children with angioedema rapidly improve with intravenous corticosteroids, antihistamines, and subcutaneous epinephrine, which are the mainstay of treatment. The airway should be secured in any child demonstrating signs and symptoms of acute airway obstruction, such as stridor and respiratory distress [18].",

The majority of the children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy present with symptoms of chronic airway obstruction, especially at night time; however a small group will present suddenly during an acute viral upper respiratory tract infection that causes additional swelling. Infectious mononucleosis commonly causes enlargement of lymphoid tissue and may precipitate acute obstruction in rare situations (see preceding paragraphs). Children with underlying craniofacial abnormalities such as Down\u2019s syndrome [150, 151] and children with hypotonia are more susceptible to acute episodes of obstruction from adenotonsillar swelling. Careful questioning of caregivers will often elicit a history of preceding chronic airway obstruction, especially at night time with loud snoring, obstructed and irregular breathing, and even brief periods of apnea. During an acute infection, these symptoms become more severe. Severe, long-standing airway obstruction may progress to cor pulmonale and right heart failure. Therefore, failure to respond to medical therapy is usually an indication for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.",

Subglottic stenosis may be congenital (see chapter on airway malformations) or acquired. Prior to 1965 and before the advent of neonatal intensive care, acquired subglottic stenosis more commonly affected older children and adults following either trauma or infection (particularly supraglottitis, diphtheria, and tuberculosis). Acquired subglottic stenosis in these cases was frequently observed as a complication following tracheotomy, and not prolonged tracheal intubation. Significant advances in pediatric critical care medicine, vaccination, and antimicrobial therapy has decreased the incidence of tracheotomy in this age group [152\u2013155], and since 1965 the majority of cases of acquired subglottic stenosis involve children who develop subglottic stenosis following prolonged tracheal intubation due to preterm delivery. Early studies in this age group suggested that acquired subglottic stenosis occurs in 1.8 % of infants less than 1,500 g and one in 678 of infants greater than 1,500 g [153]. Given the significant advances in neonatal intensive care (especially with regards to the use of surfactant and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation), the incidence of acquired subglottic stenosis in this age group is likely lower. Regardless, even in the absence of newer data, acquired subglottic stenosis remains a significant complication following prolonged tracheal intubation.",

Aggressive medical therapy should be commenced immediately to decrease the size of tumor mass. Tracheal intubation should only be considered for severe respiratory compromise as these masses may also impinge on the bronchial tree distal to the tip of the endotracheal tube and will not improve with positive-pressure ventilation.

Post-extubation stridor is relatively common problem and occurs in as may as 37 % of critically ill children [172]. Postextubation stridor may prolong length of stay in the intensive care unit, particularly if airway obstruction is severe and reintubation proves necessary.

Using an uncuffed tracheal tube, for example, does allow a tube of larger internal diameter to be used, minimizing resistance to airflow and the work of breathing in the spontaneously breathing child. A prolonged period of tracheal intubation and a poorly fitted tracheal tube are significant risk factors for damage to the tracheal mucosa regardless of whether the tracheal tube is cuffed or uncuffed. Cuffed tracheal tubes may have significant advantages over uncuffed tracheal tubes, including better control of air leakage and decreased risk of aspiration and infection in mechanically ventilated children. Therefore, cuffed tracheal tubes are being used with greater frequency in this age group [174, 175], especially when high inflation pressures are required to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation in the setting of severe acute lung disease. The available data suggests that there is no difference in the incidence of post-extubation stridor in children who were tracheally intubated with cuffed tubes as compared to those who received uncuffed tubes [174\u2013181].",

Patients suffering from burn and trauma appear to be at particularly significant risk. As discussed previously above, children with trisomy 21 are also at significant risk of developing post-extubation stridor. Children with trisomy 21 have smaller airways than other children due to an overall decrease in the diameter of the tracheal lumen. Tracheal intubation should therefore be performed with an endotracheal tube at least two sizes smaller than would be used in a child of the same age without trisomy 21 in order to avert potential trauma to the airway [183].",

Several treatment options for post-extubation stridor exist, though known have been shown to prevent subsequent re-intubation in severe cases. The vasoconstrictive properties of racemic epinephrine and its proven efficacy in the treatment of croup have led to its routine immediately following extubation in many neonatal and pediatric ICUs [42\u201347, 187, 188]. The use of corticosteroids in the prevention and/or treatment of post-extubation stridor are advocated by many pediatric intensivists, though there is very little evidence to support the universal use of corticosteroids at this time. Dexamethasone at a dose of 1\u20131.5 mg/kg/day divided every 6\u20138 h (maximum daily dose 40 mg/day) has also been administered in an attempt to interrupt the progressive cycle of inflammation that results in edema of injured tissue following extubation. Again, the evidence that this therapy prevents re-intubation is limited [189\u2013196], though one meta-analysis suggested a possible benefit [193]. Regardless, in a national survey of pediatric critical care fellowship program directors, 66 % of those surveyed continue to rely on the air leak test and use corticosteroids to prevent post-extubation stridor and extubation failure. Further, the majority stated that they would delay extubation and administer corticosteroids in the presence an air leak of \u2265 30 cm H2O [194]. Finally, helium-oxygen mixtures (see preceding discussion) have also been used in several studies [195\u2013201]. Heliox should be viewed only as a temporizing measure until either the aforementioned therapies become effective or the disease process naturally resolves. In the majority of cases, post-extubation stridor is self limited, though re-intubation is occasionally required. Unfortunately, re-intubation further exacerbates the reactive airway edema. Ideally, a smaller tracheal tube (generally one size smaller) than previously used should be placed with the hope of causing less airway injury. The new tracheal tube is generally left in place until air-leak is observed 24\u201348 h later. Anatomic airway problems like subglottic stenosis, tracheal compression, etc should be considered if post-extubation stridor persists following the second attempt at extubation.",

While most foreign bodies pass through the vocal cords and lodge in the lower airways, laryngeal foreign bodies are not uncommon and are immediately life-threatening. The clinical presentation depends upon the location of the foreign body as well as the degree of obstruction. Importantly, the actual aspiration event is not always identified and a high index of suspicion is required. Foreign bodies that are lodged in the glottic or subglottic airway (extrathoracic obstruction) often produce symptoms that mimic croup such as sudden onset of stridor and respiratory distress. In contrast, foreign bodies lodged in the distal trachea (intrathoracic obstruction) tend to produce coughing and wheezing, mimicking asthma or bronchiolitis.",

Large objects that are lodged in the proximal esophagus and apply pressure to the posterior larynx may also produce stridor and signs of upper airway obstruction. Coins are the most common foreign bodies ingested (Fig. 2.11) [203, 204]. Coins are radio-opaque and usually easy to remove via rigid esophagoscopy. Children with a history of choking and respiratory distress should undergo immediate rigid bronchoscopy, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Radiographs may be helpful if the child is otherwise stable. Most distal tracheal or bronchial foreign objects can often be identified on inspiratory/expiratory films, lateral decubitus films, or chest fluoroscopy. Lateral neck radiographs are helpful if the foreign body is radio-opaque (Fig. 2.11). However, most aspirated foreign bodies are not radiopaque and lodge in the bronchi. The presence of atelectasis (i.e. distal to a bronchus that is completely occluded by a foreign body) or air trapping and hyperinflation (i.e. distal to a partially-obstructing foreign body), which are viewed best on expiratory films, are findings that are highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration (Fig. 2.12) [205, 206]. However, a recent study questioned the utility of this additional test [207]. Basic life support maneuvers should be initiated in the field, whenever possible. Rigid bronchoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of foreign body aspiration and is the treatment of choice [202]. Occasionally, tracheotomy is required. If bronchoscopic extraction is unsuccessful, pulmonary lobectomy may be necessary. Foreign bodies often elicit a local inflammatory response, which is generally self-limited. Racemic epinephrine and systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial in this scenario.\n\n\n",

Although less common compared to adults, laryngeal fractures occasionally occur. Laryngotracheal separation, while relatively uncommon, is potentially life-threatening. The severity of airway obstruction dictates the extent of the initial evaluation and management. An unstable airway should be immediately secured using the flexible bronchoscope. Tracheal intubation without endoscopic evaluation is best avoided. If immediate surgical intervention is required, tracheotomy is preferable to cricothyrotomy. If the airway is stable, radiographic evaluation should include chest radiograph (to look for associated injuries, such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema), lateral neck radiograph (to evaluate the cervical spine), and CT. A barium swallow may be helpful to rule out the possibility of esophageal tear or laceration [208\u2013214].",
