Moreover, if or when mutations have occurred in SARS-CoV-2, it is unknown whether these may have occurred within nonhuman animal reservoirs, or following human transfer.

Similar to the original SARS virus, also a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of binding cell surface-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is richly expressed on pneumocytes, as well as endothelial cells.11,16 This interaction facilitates viral intracellular entry. In addition, the viral spike protein has a polybasic cleavage site at a location between the spike subunits, which may be proteolytically cleaved; this is thought to enhance viral entry and infectivity.17,18",

However, clinical manifestations may be quite variable. Fever is a near-universal finding.

Biochemical evidence of myocardial injury was present in \u224815% of patients; further, overt shock was evident in <10% of patients.24 As expected, ARDS and shock were more common in ICU-hospitalized patients. Systemic arterial blood pressure did not appear to relate to survival; however, inotrope/vasoconstrictor usage was substantially higher in ICU-hospitalized and non-survivor patients.25 Moreover, the hemodynamic profiles of shock in these patients are unclear. Finally, as is common in other etiologies of shock and respiratory failure, dysfunction of other end-organs, such as the kidney and the liver, was found to be more common and more severe in ICU-hospitalized and non-survivor patient groups. In particular, acute kidney injury and its severity were highly correlated with poorer outcomes.",

They were experienced with the SARS epidemic and applied that experience early in the spread of the disease. Likewise, the medical sophistication of Italy appears underappreciated in the lay press. The Italian setup mostly focused on large hospitals with ICU preparedness, lacking a comprehensive plan on community medicine and small healthcare institutions.29 Indeed, the first patient was diagnosed in a small city, Codogno. Following this, a \u201cRed Zone,\u201d with total limitation of social mobility, was instituted for containment of infectious spread. The case was particularly challenging since this patient was a young healthy athlete without any medical or epidemiological (travel to China or contact) risk factors. The first case immediately prompted the development of a task force for managing and limiting the outbreak on a Regional level.30 The United States is early in its experience with COVID-19, but has per capita fatality rates that are, along with Germany, the lowest of those countries afflicted with a large burden of infected patients. The early German public health experience with COVID-19 is particularly noteworthy for the lowest mortality outcomes within the group of infected patients, but the reasons for this are unclear at this time. Unpublished communications suggest that this may be due, at least in part, to a younger COVID-19-infected population.",

To this end, a basic diagnostic algorithm for \u201cfever clinics,\u201d given the high sensitivity of fever as a sign of COVID-19, has been developed.31 High-fidelity, sensitive, specific, and predictive diagnostic strategies are needed. It should be noted that current Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations reiterate that \u201cclinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness\u201d as appropriate. Conversely, COVID testing should be employed for those with a high index of suspicion and for those at increased risk.32 A hierarchy of \u201cpriorities of testing\u201d is provided by the CDC. Current diagnostic strategies include obtaining samples for viral testing from the upper (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash) or lower (induced sputum, endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage) respiratory tract samples for via nucleic acid amplification tests, such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; as well as for bacterial or fungal cultures as is appropriate.33,34 Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 may be made via follow on nucleic acid sequencing, via detection of the specific N, E, S, and RdRP viral genes. For in-hospital patients, we recommend sending two specimens on two different days to ensure adequate specimen collection. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealing ground-glass opacities or consolidation consistent with the disease increases the clinical suspicion of disease.19,20 Basic monitoring includes pulse oximetry and telemetry for stable patients outside the intensive care unit, and more invasive monitoring with systemic arterial and central venous/pulmonary arterial (PA) catheters in the intensive care unit. Of note, for inpatients, continued viral detection and shedding has been reported which may also be monitored via blood and stool sampling.35,36",

As either a noninvasive or invasive mode of MV, CPAP increases basal (throughout the respiratory cycle, and thus evident even at end-expiration, the invasive analog being positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) intra-alveolar pressure, and thus, lung volume. Globally, this may manifest as an improvement from lower-normal to higher lung volumes in the setting of normal overall lung compliance, or in the setting of low overall lung compliance, from lower- to normal-higher lung volumes. MV recruits under- or non-ventilated alveoli that are otherwise yet perfused, and thus improves O2 transfer of blood flowing past these alveoli, and the overall V/Q ratio. BiPAP, which is analogous to pressure-support invasive MV, provides CPAP plus additional input airway pressure during inspiration. This not only increases mean alveolar pressure and volume, but does so by augmenting the inspiratory flow rate, and for a fixed inspiratory time, the tidal volume. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a reasonable initial strategy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, provided that hypoxemia is not profound, and the anticipated duration of NIV support is not long. The issue with NIV is the need for patient cooperation. There is current concern that CPAP and BIPAP modes may potentiate aerosolization of the respiratory viral particles. Some institutional guidelines limit high-flow nasal cannula to <30 L/min, and avoid NIV, due to risk of staff infection, and further suggest that early intubation should be attempted.53 The timing of such transition from NIV to invasive MV presently remains patient specific.",

First, several groups have (unpublished data) suggested that COVID-19 is associated with microvascular thrombosis in several tissue beds: pulmonary, coronary, and renal. Indeed, high D-dimer is associated with increased severity and mortality of COVID-19, which is indicative of microthrombosis in these arterial/arteriolar/capillary beds.26 This may a contributory mechanism with respect to why severe hypoxemia is observed in the setting of normal or high lung compliance, since capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium both may be involved. In addition to hypoxemia, pulmonary vascular microthrombi, when severe, may also contribute to shock.59 Second, because of refractory hypoxemia, most clinicians increase PEEP. However, high PEEP may result in alveolar overdistension in the setting of normal or high compliance. High PEEP also can augment pulmonary vascular impedance (creation of West Zone 1 lung; although if this incidentally happened to occur in unventilated lung zones and pulmonary blood flow were better redistributed to better-ventilated lung zones, this might ameliorate hypoxemia), and reduce systemic venous return, both of which reduce RV stroke volume and cardiac output (CO). Conversely, decreased oscillatory lung loading via low tidal volume and distending pressure \u201clung-protective\u201d ventilation may cause or exacerbate hypercapnia, permissive or otherwise.",

Peripheral cannulation generally cannot achieve the fluid mechanics of central cannulation. However, peripheral cannulation is most commonly percutaneous and has lower periprocedural bleeding risks. Finally, practitioners of a variety of specialties can be trained to perform peripheral cannulation procedures\u2014i.e. cardiothoracic surgeons, interventional cardiologists, critical care anesthesiologists, and ICU physicians. Although central cannulation is hemodynamically advantageous (with respect to higher flow rates; hemodynamic support is not relevant in pure V-V ECMO), in light of its invasiveness, bleeding risks, and specialized training required, it is more reasonable to propose peripheral cannulation as the initial approach of choice for COVID-19-related respiratory failure.",

Advantages of the single cannula approach include reduced risks of local bleeding complications and the potential to ambulate. In the case of right atrial/ventricular inflow and pulmonary arterial outflow, lesser degrees of recirculation are present. This latter single cannula approach also provides RV mechanical circulatory support (MCS) (see below). However, overall volumetric flow rates may be lower, and image guidance during cannulation is necessary. In contrast, the two-cannula approach requires two venous cannulation sites and typically precludes the ability to ambulate. Moreover, recirculation is common, although it may occur with the single cannula approach if both inflow and outflow are in the systemic venous compartment. However, higher flow rates are achievable with the two-cannula approach, and image guidance\u2014which often is not present under emergent circumstances\u2014usually is not needed. The lack of need for image guidance means that unlike the single cannula approach, cannulation using the two-cannula technique does not require operating room or catheterization laboratory environments, and potential COVID-19 exposure of these vital spaces and their ancillary staff. Thus, we suggest that the two-cannula technique should be preferred for most institutions and circumstances. Bi-femoral approaches are particularly advantageous in terms of rapidity of deployment, avoidance of cannulating surgeons and physicians being positioned near the patient\u2019s oropharynx and endotracheal tube, and ease of subsequent prone positioning.

In patients with shock, echocardiography (see following discussion) is particularly useful, and pulmonary arterial catheters are helpful as well, both for blood flow measurements as well blood gas measurements from different circulatory compartments. Underlying congenital or acquired structural or coronary arterial disease is assumed to be absent for the purposes of this discussion. If the systemic arterial blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <60 mmHg) is decreased, or high doses of inotropic and vasoactive agents are required to achieve a normal-range systemic arterial blood pressure, then echocardiography should be undertaken. If the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) is at least moderately reduced (LVEF <40%), this is clearly abnormal, and in the acute setting, with a non-dilated LV and normal-range LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), stroke volume would be substantially reduced. In addition, invasive hemodynamic monitoring assessments, such as those provided by pulmonary arterial catheters, often are helpful in discerning whether intrinsic LV dysfunction is present (LV stroke work may be calculated; see discussion below).",

Regardless of whether systemic arterial hypotension is thought to be cardiogenic with LV failure, distributive, or mixed, the LVEF generally is a useful index to use in order to determine whether MCS is reasonable. If LVEF is high or even normal in the setting of systemic arterial hypotension, and the LVEDV and heart rate are normal, then the CO is normal or elevated, and MCS would have to be able (with native output) exceed that in order to have a hemodynamic benefit. In contrast, if the LVEF is low, then for a normal LVEDV and heart rate, the CO is reduced despite optimal LV preload, and MCS may be reasonable. If the LVEF is reduced, and high doses of inotropes are required to treat systemic arterial hypotension, MCS for the LV may be appropriate in highly selected COVID-19 patients.

As stated earlier, PRSW or stroke work index70 is the gold-standard index for the assessment of LV systolic function, being superior to systolic ventricular elastance measures.69,71 Determination of PRSW requires a range of LVEDVs to be studied, but for a given LVEDV, a particular SW may be used as an isolated data point. LV power (CPO) is the closest clinical correlate to SW (being LV work per unit time) and is clinically calculated as MAP multiplied by CO.71 This is analogous to electrical power, which for a simple circuit with a single battery and resistor is equal to current (flow) multiplied by voltage (pressure difference), or the square of the current (flow) multiplied by resistance (systemic vascular resistance). An important caveat in using CPO is that it is not a per beat assessment, in that heart rate is incorporated.

However, these approaches are more technically demanding and require a high level of practitioner and institutional expertise. As is the case for V-A ECMO, we recommend that only highly selected patients with COVID-19 be considered for short-term LVAD support. Because the Impella catheter-mounted micro-axial VADs are substantially different from other pump mechanisms insofar as the pump mechanisms themselves are intracorporeal and miniaturized, we briefly mention two salient features. First, percutaneous transfemoral placement may be performed at the bedside under echocardiographic guidance, rather in than in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. In pandemic conditions, this may be useful. Second, placement via an axillary artery approach, using the newest iteration of introducer sheaths and securing devices, results in secure pump position, which may facilitate safer prone positioning. With further reference to the range of Impella devices, a wide range of delivered volumetric flow rates may be achieved. The original Impella 2.5 device generally may not provide adequate flow for the severely compromised shock patient for which robust LV MCS is required. The Impella CP device is better with a peak flow of 4.3 L/m. The Impella 5.0 and 5.5 devices, each of which may be introduced via side-grafts on the axillary artery, are capable of providing flows of 5.0 and 5.5 L/m, respectively, that is, levels of flow close to those achievable with surgically implanted LVADs, all via a minimally invasive platform. Finally, secure pump positioning achieved with devices inserted via axillary artery side-grafts has the advantage of longer-term MCS, in patients with slow recovery of LV function.

In such patients in the acute setting, attempting to treat the underlying etiology of impaired gas exchange using V-V ECMO alone may not be sufficient. This is because V-V ECMO recirculation is exacerbated by reduced RVEF and tricuspid regurgitation. In cases of cor pulmonale with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, we suggest that strategies to support the RV are appropriate. For patients who may require proning, percutaneous RVADs using femoro-femoral approaches, can be used with an oxygenator. The single cannula (e.g., Protek Duo) approach to this offers the advantages of peripheral cannulation via one site, and with minimal recirculation. Central approaches may be reasonable in patients in whom high-flow rates cannot be achieved.

If an E-CPR program is also structured for organ donation and shares these personnel, strict cooperation with the transplant allocation system should be maintained, as COVID-19 status has eventually to be thoroughly assessed and evaluated.",

We emphasize that V-V ECMO is NOT an alternative to mechanical ventilation or proning. On a physiologic level utilizing active, appropriate pressure and volume lung inflation, avoiding barotrauma, with low-level PEEP, is vital to maintain pulmonary alveolar inflation, reduce fluid transudation and attempt to maintain a modicum of innate lung physiology, with an aim towards recovery. V-V ECMO should only be considered when mechanical ventilation is failing. Further, from a resource utilization and relative risk perspective, moving to ECMO is a resource-intensive and resource-consuming procedure that should be utilized with careful consideration. To date, survival on ECMO for cardiorespiratory failure is highly variable in COVID patients and significantly less than the previously reported 40% at most centers.84",

As of this writing, no data exists as to its translatable utility in compromised COVID patients on ECMO.
