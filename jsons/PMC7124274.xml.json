            "text": "The development of vaccines and vaccination programs has been evolving for centuries. The observation that persons that had recovered from smallpox infections were immune to reinfection has been recorded throughout history by several societies. Many Eastern cultures practiced different forms of variolation for several centuries.1 By the sixteenth century the practice of variolation (inoculating partially attenuated variola virus to prevent smallpox) was common in Europe.2 This practice originated more or less simultaneously with the practice of inoculating lambs with sheep pox. In the latter years of the eighteenth century, cross-protective properties of the vaccinia virus (cow pox) allowed for the more socially acceptable practice of \u201cvaccination\u201d to become a routine component of medicine.3 Problems with consistent potency, available supply, purity, and safety were common. Nevertheless, both the effectiveness and imperfections of vaccination lead to the eventual global eradication of smallpox, and was the inspiration for development of the products and programs for immunization against several diseases in humans and animals.",

            "text": "Louis Pasteur first used the term vaccine in 1881 for immunogens directed at other diseases besides smallpox. Pasteur directed many investigations that demonstrated the feasibility of attenuating or inactivating microbes. Studies with fowl cholera and anthrax led to the concepts of chemical inactivation as a means to reduce the virulence of microorganisms.4, 5 Studies with erysipelas and rabies explored serial passage in animals (lapinization or passage through rabbits) or other animal derived tissues as an alternative strategy to reduce or eliminate virulence.6 Thus, the virulence of infectious microbes could be completely or partially reduced. These studies have led to the eventual successful control of anthrax and rabies in particular. The work of Salmon and Smith7 (1886) clearly demonstrated that some microbes could be completely inactivated (killed). These developments eventually led to successful immunization programs against typhoid fever, tuberculosis, rinderpest, and foot and mouth disease (FMD). Attenuation and inactivation principles were extended to microbial toxins by the work of Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute.8 A tetanus toxoid was developed in 1924 through heat and formalin inactivation of the toxin to form an \u201canatoxin.\u201d Also, enhanced efficacy was provided by absorbing the toxoid to an aluminum hydroxide, providing an adjuvant effect. These process and formulation improvements were developed and refined in the early twentieth century, first through production of equine sera with antidiphtheria and antitetanus toxin-neutralizing antibody for prophylactic use. In the modern era of vaccine use, these same basic technologies are still the mainstays of vaccine production. However, new generations of recombinant, nucleic acid and subunit vaccines have become available. It is remarkable that the principles of developmental research, registration, and manufacture still follow the techniques of the grand heritage.",

More often than not these vaccines were produced in regional research institutions. Industrialization of the processes began in the 1930s and 1940s when large-scale, controlled processes were used to produce FMD antigens in Germany by Waldmann and colleagues.9 The development of first primary and subsequently clean cell lines occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. Development of high-volume roller bottle methods and later large-scale bioreactors has made possible the production of millions of doses of vaccines.2 Further, production has been maintained in secure, closed systems, enhancing the security for the environment as well as the technical staff. In like manner, improvements in inactivation technologies (cyclized binary ethylene-imines), purification and concentration of antigens, storage of bulk antigens, improved aluminum gels, and oil suspension adjuvants in the formulation of polyvalent antigens have been critical achievements in the steady advancements in vaccinology.2\n",

The routine use of processed immunoglobulins (usually in the form of processed horse serum) preceded the use of vaccines. Although passive protection by the immunoglobulins is still employed (particularly for rabies and tetanus post exposure prophylaxis), the advantages of active immunity (immunologic memory and reduced risk of infection) have significantly reduced the use of passive immunity.",

These immunization series are usually administered between the fourth and 16th weeks of life.12, 14 Puppies and kittens associated with unusual risk may be vaccinated at younger ages or at more frequent intervals. Rabies vaccination is usually first given at 4 months of age.14 It is a common and efficacious practice to provide booster doses at 1 year of age for most vaccines.14 These immunization practices will provide a solid duration of immunity of at least 5 to 7 years and longer in some cases. General recommendations (World Small Animal Veterinary Association) are to vaccinate every third year after the initial immunization series, and these recommendations are consistent with product label guidelines.12 These initial immunization guidelines are derived from the initial registration immunogenicity and efficacy studies for any individual vaccine product. The efficacy studies define the minimum immunologic strength for the vaccine (the potency that must be present when the vaccine lot goes out of date). These same types of studies also define the minimum age of animals that can be successfully immunized as well as the specifics of the initial and booster immunization regimens (part 9, Code of Federal Regulations). It has become very clear that many vaccines provide effective and long-term immunity for an extended period of time.11 Over the past 3 decades, cumulative evidence for extended duration of immunity has been provided to support the 3-year booster intervals for most vaccines in dogs and cats. However, as described in Table 1, the relative efficacy of some vaccines is less than ideal.",

Effective control of infectious disease should result in reduced incidence and prevalence.15, 16 This would be true of not only clinical disease but also of infection and spread of the infectious agent. It is very clear that use of efficacious products has reduced incidence of rabies, particularly in dogs. Immunization of dogs has reduced the incidence of canine rabies to essentially nil in the United States and western Europe.17 The rabies immunization programs in these countries have been so effective that most manufacturers of rabies vaccine for dogs and cats have switched to master seeds from canine street strains of virus to other types of terrestrial rabies (bat strains, for instance) to protect from the most significant current threats in these regions.",

In situations where vaccines do not provide prevention of infection, concurrent infections may exist and vaccine failures are therefore more common. There are often issues with type-specific protections. For instance, it is not clear that available vaccines can protect cats against all types of calicivirus infections. Continual vigilance is required to ensure continued protection of animals in the face of potential newly evolving and emerging pathogens (eg, rabies and other lyssaviruses, canine distemper and parvoviruses, and feline calicivirus).",

However, mature, well-differentiated immune responses are the consequence of cumulative, regulated interactions between phagocytic cells, antigen-presenting cells, and both B and T lymphocytes. Therefore, a well-differentiated antibody response with isotype switching, affinity maturation to high avidity, and memory requires some effective initial stimulation involving dendritic cells and expansion of regulatory T lymphocytes (likely CD4+) and B lymphocytes.

For instance, antibody-mediated neutralization of rabies virus in extracellular spaces inhibits transmission to neurons and subsequent axonal progression of the virus to the central nervous system. In this case the presence of preformed, neutralizing antibody is critical for protection. A summary of protective characteristics of the immune responses to vaccines (as potential correlates of protection and disease prevention) is provided in Table 2\n. Although antibody responses are good correlates of protection, they do not always reflect all available protective mechanisms provided by a well-differentiated immune response. In some cases, other correlates are available. It is clear that the presence of neutralizing, vaccine-derived antibody will reduce mucosal virus replication, virus shedding, and viremia in kittens vaccinated with modified live feline herpes vaccines.20, 21, 22 However, regulated CD4+ and CD8+ cellular responses are required to control tissue damage and reactivation of disease.23 In this case, antibody may be a protective correlate of infection while cellular immunity is a protective correlate of disease. The ability of modified live vaccines to generate a very rapid onset of cytokines and interferons (and rapid antigen focusing in dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues) is associated with a rapid onset of protection, even though antibody responses may not be detectable in serum for up to 2 weeks.20, 21, 22 Therefore, the early response of multiple cytokines and concurrent activation of the innate immune system may serve as early correlates of protection.",

However, the presence of detectable neutralizing serum antibody is correlated with protection against recrudescent disease.23 In situations where vaccinated animals may be exposed to heterotypic viruses or bacteria, the presence of immune CD4+ T cells specific to conserved antigens may be very important for protection.24 It is possible that the effective mechanisms for development of protection associated with a vaccine may be specific to the nature of the disease and infectious process. Recent studies have provided important information regarding this phenomenon. A common hypothesis is that vaccine-induced immunity should reflect convalescent immunity following natural infection. For example, It is known that recovery from primary poxvirus infections requires robust cytokine responses, natural killer cells, and antibodies as well as T helper (CD4) and cytotoxic T (CD8) lymphocyte effector functions.25 However, recovery from a secondary infection requires only T- and B-lymphocyte interaction and an anamnestic antibody response. Again, neutralizing antibody will reduce infection, viremia, and spread of a virus (and may do so to the extent of blocking infection) while T-cell\u2013mediated responses will allow survival and recovery. It seems clear that balanced antibody and cellular responses are necessary for complete protection from infection and disease as well as spread to other animals.",
