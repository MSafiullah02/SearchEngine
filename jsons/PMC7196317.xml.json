The plan was to publish the series to coincide with the 2020 International Confederation of Midwives conference in Bali, where \u2018Midwifery\u2019 was going to be represented at writing for publication workshops and plans were underway for a reception for friends and colleagues of the journal. Alas, as we all now know, plans have had to be postponed.",

Life during the pandemic is on hold, the things we all took for granted such as meeting up with family and friends, shopping or going to the gym, the freedom to go out and about when and where we wanted no longer an option. The extent of the lockdown we have to comply with is wide-ranging and the duration uncertain. The urgency and importance for our communities and healthcare systems of compliance with social isolation are starkly laid out, but nevertheless, these restrictions have left many of us feeling anxious about lives taken over by events we cannot control and fearful for the health and safety of loved ones.",

Pregnant women in the UK have been classed as a \u2018vulnerable group\u2019 by our Chief Medical Officer, based on evidence that response to severe viral infection is compromised in some pregnant women. This means that pregnant women should increase efforts to socially distance themselves to reduce risk of infection. In response, UK midwives have been reassessing and revising the number of face-to-face contacts they offer women to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission from attending busy hospitals, as well as the need to accommodate high levels of sickness among midwifery and other healthcare staff. Many antenatal and postnatal contacts are now being undertaken using mobile and web-based technology, and difficult decisions have had to be made about support for home births and re-allocation of midwifery-led birth centres to triage centres for pregnant women who present with symptoms of COVID-19. These decisions are impacting on women's choices and fears about their pregnancy and birth care and we should all be mindful that self-isolation could increase women's risk of perinatal anxiety and depression, and exposure to domestic violence. Nevertheless, all of the clinical colleagues I work with are continuing to put women at the centre of everything they do in the most difficult of circumstances.",

Several institutions are collating and regularly updating data on how the virus is impacting on maternal and neonatal outcomes. The National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford University has commenced a new study as part of their ongoing UK-wide Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) to determine the incidence in the UK of hospitalisation with Covid-19 infection in pregnancy and assess outcomes for a woman and her infant (npeu.ox.ac.uk/ukoss/current-surveillance/covid-19-in-pregnancy).",

It is early days and imperative that those supporting pregnant and postnatal women regularly check latest updates provided by their lead professional or public health agencies as the numbers of reported cases of infection and the \u2018learning\u2019 from these are constantly changing. Links to the current advice offered by the UK Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, including for women with more medically complex pregnancies, are provided below. This information (which is also subject to change) should be used alongside current guidance relevant to a woman's maternity care, including care of pre-existing or new onset physical or psychological health problems and ensuring women continue to be asked about their mental health at every contact.",
