            "text": "Infectious diseases of livestock have a direct major fi nancial impact globally through production losses arising from morbidity and mortality. Such losses can include poor weight gain or productivity, condemnation of product, lower commercial return, and inability to trade nationally and internationally. A number of infectious diseases of mammals and birds are of additional global concern due to their zoonotic potential, their ability to be carried across geographical boundaries, their ability to jump species, and to evade or subvert host immune defenses and to throw-off more virulent variants. Examples include infl uenza viruses, Salmonella , and Leishmania . The direct and indirect social and economic costs associated with infection are hard to assess [ 1 ] , but can be dramatic. For example, the H1N1 infl uenza pandemic in Mexico in 2009 directly affected tourism, the service sector, retail trade, transport, entertainment, the agricultural industry (particularly pig farmers) and depressed international investment. The outbreak is estimated to have reduced economic activity by 0.3-0.5 % of gross domestic product (i.e., between US$ 2.7 and 4.5 billion) [ 2 ] . The 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK took 7 months to eradicate, resulted in the slaughter of more than six million animals and was estimated to cost \u00a38 billion to the public and private sectors [ 3 ] , as well as having considerable environmental costs [ 4 ] .",

The demand for alternative means of controlling disease and enhancing livestock health is driven by increasing concern of consumers over the potential for drug and antibiotic residues in meat [ 5 ] and greater awareness of the burden of antibiotic resistance in the environment [ 6 ] . However, vaccines are not a \"silver bullet.\" To be most effective they invariably need to be deployed within comprehensive control strategies that include detailed understanding of the disease epidemiology, biosecurity, quarantine, surveillance, diagnosis, education, and control of the disease vector or reservoir species. It was this combination of measures that resulted in the eradication of Rinderpest through vaccination [ 7 ] . Indeed, veterinary vaccines can be remarkably effective. As well as enabling Rinderpest to be eradicated, the development of safe, affordable rabies vaccines efficacious in a variety of species has resulted in dramatic reductions in the burden of this devastating disease in some continents [ 8 ] and vaccination against the parasitic protozoa Eimeria has been a major success in the fight against avian coccidiosis, arguably one of the most economically important livestock diseases in the world [ 9 ] . The recent deployment of the first genetically modified live bacterial vaccine for avian pathogenic E. coli has opened the market for a new range of vaccines [ 10 ] .",

Typically the species of concern is targeted directly for vaccination. However, it may be that the vaccine is targeted to a reservoir species that presents a risk. For example, European badgers ( Meles meles ) may be vaccinated against bovine tuberculosis (TB) in England and Wales with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) (BadgerBCG, Animal and Plant Health Agency, UK) in an effort to break the transmission of Mycobacterium bovis infection between badgers and cattle. There are also experimental vaccines against Toxoplasma gondii infection of domestic cats that could be used to reduce excretion of oocytes into the environment, thereby protecting sheep from infection with the parasite resulting in abortion [ 14 ] . Another important application of vaccination of veterinary species is to protect humans from zoonoses . Examples of this include vaccination of domestic dogs and sylvatic carnivore species to protect against rabies in humans and domestic and companion animals; vaccination of poultry and pigs against zoonotic serovars of Salmonella spp. ; vaccination of cattle against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 [ 15 ] ; and the proposed vaccination of dogs against Leishmania spp. to protect humans against visceral leishmaniasis [ 16 ] .",

The paradigm for such a vaccine was the development of BCG vaccine against TB . Starting with a virulent bovine strain of M. bovis, Albert Calmette and Camille Gu\u00e9rin cultured the bacteria on a medium composed of ox bile, glycerine and potato and then subcultured the bacteria at roughly 3 weekly intervals. After 11 years or approximately 230 subcultures the bacteria failed to produce progressive TB when injected into a variety of mammalian species, including cattle. Since that time, BCG remains the only TB vaccine licensed for use in humans and has been the subject of numerous trials in cattle to test its ability to protect against bovine TB. As has been observed for humans, BCG's ability to confer protection to bovine TB is highly variable. However, its main limitation is that it can sensitize cattle to produce a positive tuberculin skin-test reaction, the mainstay of surveillance and control for bovine TB . Defi ning the genetic lesions in BCG responsible for attenuation became possible with the advent of wholegenome sequencing. The availability of the complete genome sequence data for many pathogens now permits selective deletion or disruption of genes to result in targeted attenuation. A good example of this is the recently launched avian pathogenic E. coli vaccine, Poulvac \u00ae E. coli (Zoetis) [ 10 ] .",

Thus, they do not readily allow for differentiation between infected versus vaccinated animals (DIVA), which makes them less suitable for use in disease eradication efforts. Some notable examples include footand-mouth disease (FMD), leptospirosis, brucellosis and bovine TB . Vaccines may interference with surveillance methods in two different ways: either it is not possible to differentiate the wild-type pathogen from its vaccine strain in a diagnostic sample, e.g., for infectious bursal disease (IBD), Newcastle disease (ND), and FMD; or a vaccine generates false positivity in an immunodiagnostic test. For example, seroconversion following vaccination against IBD or sensitization of vaccinated livestock to the single bovine intradermal tuberculin test as a consequence of vaccination with the paratuberculosis/Johne's disease vaccine, Silirum \u00ae (CZ Veterinaria) [ 19 ] or BCG. In the latter case, considerable effort has been invested in the characterization and validation of DIVA diagnostic reagents that might permit the use of BCG in cattle. In some cases, the gene product disrupted for attenuation may encode an immunodominant, unprotective, nonessential antigen and this can be used as the basis of a DIVA test to discriminate vaccination from infection with wild-type pathogen.",

However, there is a risk that the vaccine virus can revert to a virulent form or recombine with fi eld viruses and cause disease. This was seen with attenuated vaccines for both BVD and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). In the case of attenuated vaccines against AI, there is an inherent risk of gene reassortment with wild-type viruses and the emergence of pathogenic variants. Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a particular problem for the intensive poultry industry. Attenuated vaccines for ILT, particularly those derived by passage in chicken embryos, have been associated with a number of side effects, including residual virulence, transmission to na\u00efve birds, latent infection with subsequent reactivation and shedding of virus, and reversion to virulence after passage in vivo. Most recently, recombination between attenuated ILT vaccines in the fi eld has been shown to be responsible for the emergence of new virulent viruses that have caused widespread disease.",

Even if the protective antigen is known there are still important considerations and constraints that often dictate the type of vaccine that is developed; for example, the extent to which the antigen varies naturally and whether it is necessary to retain native antigen conformation to establish protective immunity with the vaccine. Single-stranded RNA viruses , such as infl uenza, lentiviruses including feline immunodefi ciency virus (FIV) and nidoviruses such as IBV and PRRSV evolve rapidly by antigenic drift and shift meaning a vaccine developed to one variant may provide limited cross-protection to heterologous variants, presenting a major obstacle for vaccine development.

Good examples for this are the development of equine vaccines (reviewed in Ref. [ 35 ] ) and vaccines against avian infl uenza (AI) in Anseriformes, such as ducks and geese [ 36 , 37 ] . Only since 2004 has the full complement of horse immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region genes been described. The horse is atypical in that it expresses seven IgG subclasses. To achieve maximal protection to infections mediated by Fc receptor or complement-mediated elimination mechanisms, it appears vaccines should elicit IgG antibodies of particular IgG subclasses; other subclasses offering less effective protection [ 38 ] . Importantly, as the authors of this work point out, since IgG plays key roles in both serum and mucosal compartments in the horse, these considerations are applicable to both systemic and mucosal vaccination strategies. Vaccination of Anseriformes with existing AI vaccines requires a higher dose of antigen compared with chickens or the addition of a strong stimulator for the immune response to be effective.

Some vaccines contain inherent adjuvanticity due to their ability to stimulate the innate immune system via engagement of PRRs. Inactivated whole-virus or subunit vaccines invariably need an adjuvant to boost delayed or weak protective immunity, e.g., for swine infl uenza virus or PRRSV, especially where the pathogen downregulates host immunity, e.g., PRRSV and to overcome the effects of maternal antibodies on young animals (a form of vaccine interference-see Subheading 9 ).",

Since the route of entry for many pathogens is at mucosal surfaces, the induction of immunity at mucosal surfaces is critical to prevent infection. Therefore numerous attempts have been made to deliver vaccines to mucosal surfaces (oral, ocular, nasal). It is often generalized that a common mucosal immune system exists whereby antigenic stimulation of immunity at one mucosal site results in the secretion of IgA at a distant mucosal site. However, in many cases this has shown not to be the case. Instead there is functional compartmentalization and limited reciprocity between sites. Basic understanding of the extent to which the target species shares a common mucosal immune system is an essential consideration in determining the most appropriate route of immunization. For instance, whilst oral immunization may confer protection in the respiratory tract, the converse may not be true. The oral route is likely to be the favored route for targeting populations or larger groups of animals, especially wildlife species and poultry . However, in the case of vaccine delivery for wildlife it is dependent on presentation in bait and the most suitable bait and baiting strategy may differ between species and contexts, as exemplifi ed by rabies vaccination [ 47 ] . Automated in ovo vaccination is an emerging technology for poultry , e.g., using the Inovoject \u00ae System (an Embrex \u00ae BioDevice from Zoetis) to deliver Inovocox \u00ae vaccine against coccidiosis. The manufacturers claim advantages for the system over oral or parenteral vaccination of chicks such as consistent and uniform vaccine delivery, reduced chick stress, earlier immune response and protection, and signifi cant labor savings. DNA vaccination may be improved through attempts to improve transfection effi ciency, such as transcutaneous injection, biolistic particle delivery, or electroporation (reviewed in Ref.",

Modifi ed live vaccines (MLVs) were rapidly developed following the almost simultaneous emergence of the two PRRSV genotypes in North America and Western Europe some 25 years ago. The market leading MLV (Ingelvac PRRS MLV, Boehringer Ingelheim) was based on a North American genotype isolate and it has now been attributed as being responsible for the introduction of North American PRRSV to over eight countries outside of this continent [ 52 ] . This sharply illustrates the capacity of attenuated PRRSV to revert to virulence, a property facilitated by a high-mutation rate during PRRSV replication. In addition, there are numerous reports of PRRS disease outbreaks being caused by \"vaccine-like\" isolates [ 53 -58 ]. Despite these safety issues, MLVs continue to be widely used, which is undoubtedly driven by the limited effi cacy of inactivated vaccines particularly against heterologous strains. Inactivated PRRSV vaccines are therefore best suited as autogenous or \"farmspecifi c\" vaccines as proposed by Geldhof et al. [ 59 , 60 ] .",

Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) may not be observed until at least 4 weeks post-infection, and titers, when measurable, are lower than those elicited by other viral infections [ 61 , 63 , 64 ]. Passive transfer experiments have shown that nAbs can provide a dose-dependent protection against PRRSV [ 65 -67 ] and whilst data on protection against heterologous strains by passive transfer is limited, these studies suggest that vaccination strategies inducing high-titer nAbs may be effi cacious. Consequently, the majority of approaches to develop the next generation of PRRSV vaccines have focussed on targeting the nAb response. During PRRSV infection antibodies are directed against a broad range of viral antigens and nAb responses have been mapped to GP2, GP3, GP4, GP5, and M proteins [ 68 -76 ]. The early identifi cation of highly conserved linear epitopes in the ectodomain of the major glycoprotein GP5 [ 73 , 74 , 77 , 78 ] focussed vaccine development efforts on this antigen. However, recombinant GP5 protein was poorly immunogenic, failed to provide protection and could exacerbate disease upon challenge [ 79 -82 ]. Expression of GP5 by plasmid DNA or viral vectors , alone or in conjunction with other PRRSV structural proteins, showed better immunogenicity , but typically failed to induce high titer nAbs and at best conferred only a degree of protection [ 83 -92 ] . Other studies have shed doubt on whether GP5 represents the prime vaccine candidate, including: the observation that glycosylation sites on GP5, proposed to mask antibody epitopes , are highly variable amongst strains [ 93 ] ; studies with chimeric viruses have shown that GP5 is nonessential for infection of macrophages [ 94 ] ; pigs engineered to lack the GP5 receptor sialoadhesin show an unaltered course of PRRSV infection [ 95 ] ; and affi nity purifi ed GP5-specifi c Ab fail to neutralize PRRSV infectivity in vitro [ 76 , 96 ] . There is consequently an increased focus on the minor envelope proteins, GP2, GP3, and GP4, which form a glycosylated complex essential for infectivity [ 97 -99 ] . The evaluation of the neutralization of PRRSV strains by hyperimmune sera revealed signifi cant differences in the sensitivity to neutralization that did not associate with the sequences of previously described linear nAb epitopes nor to N-linked glycosylation sites [ 100 ] . Interestingly, a proportion of sera exhibited signifi cant neutralizing activity against all isolates suggesting that these sera contain nAb specifi c for conserved epitopes that may be poorly exposed and consequently immunogenic in most PRRSV strains. This study highlights our limited understanding of the nAb response to PRRSV but suggests that the identifi cation of the structures recognized by these broadly cross-neutralizing Ab should be a priority for the PRRS research community.",

Whilst good cross protection is observed against BVDV type 1 strains, the failure of existing BVDV-1 based vaccines to protect against some emerging BVDV type 2 strains has resulted in inclusion of the latter in new vaccine preparations [ 116 ] . MLV vaccines are generally thought to be more effi cacious since they evoke stronger virus-specifi c T cell responses, induce high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies and provide a longer duration of protection from clinical disease than inactivated vaccines. However, there are safety concerns over the potential for MLVs to revert to virulence or recombine with fi eld viruses and cause disease. In addition, MLV-vaccinated animals may develop transient viremia and shed vaccine virus [ 117 , 118 ] and in the case of pregnant animals, MLVs pose the risk of vertical transmission of the vaccine strain that can result in fetal complications or persistent infection [ 20 ] . Consequently, MLVs are not licensed in a number of countries including the UK. Neither MLV nor inactivated vaccines allow for differentiation between infected versus vaccinated animals (DIVA), which limits their utility in efforts to eradicate BVDV [ 119 ] .",

Extensive work has been carried out since to optimize the dose and route of administration of BCG vaccine to cattle. Whilst no single vaccine currently offers equal or superior performance to BCG, when used in combination with BCG several offer enhanced protection, e.g., recombinant human adenovirus-vectored mycobacterial antigens [ 157 , 158 ] . Further assessment of this adenovirus-based strategy as well as development of other approaches should result in vaccine protocols that impart better protection than with BCG alone, and in particular could prolong the duration of immunity. For the foreseeable future, vaccine strategies for bTB in cattle will need to include BCG. The problem with this is that vaccination with BCG sensitizes cattle to tuberculin-based diagnostic tests, including the single intradermal comparative cervical skin test (SICCT). This sensitization is the reason a diagnostic test is needed that will allow accurate detection of infected cattle amongst the vaccinated animals (a so-called DIVA test) and so allow use of a BCG-based vaccine for bTB control alongside a test and slaughter program [ 159 ] . A longer-term research goal is the development of vaccines that do not sensitize cattle to tuberculin-based diagnostic tests. This would allow the SICCT to be used alongside vaccination. Close communication and collaboration with research groups working to develop novel human TB vaccines means there is a route to evaluate promising bTB candidates in cattle (embracing a \" One Health \" approach to vaccine development).",

In countries where control of FMD relies predominantly on vaccination, newborn animals ingest specifi c anti-FMDV antibodies in the colostrum. This maternally derived antibody provides immediate protection against infection with FMDV but also interferes with the development of active immunity following vaccination leaving young animals susceptible to FMDV infection when maternal antibodies wane.

This does not have to arise from the emergence of a new variant but could simply arise from the use of a vaccine that does not provide suffi cient cross-protection from one pathogen geno/sero-type to another resulting in the dominance of one type already in circulation. This may be part of the explanation of the failure to control canine distemper virus (CDV) infection in Korea, where at least two different CDV genotypes are in circulation that differ signifi cantly from the genotypes present in vaccine strains [ 161 ] . Ensuring a vaccine is effective against a range of circulating strains or variants can be secured by including multiple types in the same vaccine preparation but there is a signifi cant cost to such a strategy.

However, this approach cannot prevent the emergence of new variants that escape vaccine-induced immunity through mutation. This is particularly the case for viral pathogens where a high infectious load combined with a low fi delity of genome replication provide an environment for the selection of new variants. There are some good examples of this. First is the TJ strain of PRV, which is a variant of PRV that appears to be emerging along with others in China's pig population in the face of vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine strain, Bartha-K61, which until now has played a critical role in the control of Aujeszky's disease in China [ 162 ] . Sequence analysis indicates that these emerging PRV variants cluster to a relatively independent clade in the phylogenetic tree and that protection against these variants with the Bartha-K61 vaccine is incomplete [ 163 ] . Second is IB in poultry . IB is caused by an RNA virus that readily undergoes mutation and recombination so that important antigenic variants appear which evade existing vaccine protection. While conventional vaccines work well against homologous types, new strategies are needed to counter this instability. The simple use of two genetically different vaccines to protect against a wide range of heterologous types is now a widespread practice that has been very effective thus far (reviewed in Ref. [ 164 ] ).",

Mucosal vaccination has the advantage of inducing both local and systemic immune responses . In ovo vaccination offers the advantage of reduced labor costs, mass administration and the induction of an earlier immune response, as described in Subheading 7 . For rapid intervention with vaccine during a disease outbreak such as AI, mass application of vaccine is desirable in order to achieve rapid coverage of susceptible birds. An AI vaccine that could be applied by spray or aerosol would be ideal, but aerosol vaccination using live virus is not desirable because of its zoonotic potential and because of the risk for virus reassortment.

This is most likely to be meaningful when it is done in partnership between policy-makers, vaccine manufacturers, funders, and stakeholders. Even when a compelling benefi t-cost ratio is found it does not mean a vaccine will necessarily follow [ 167 ] . Disease control programs that utilize vaccination but rely on its voluntary uptake are at risk of failure if willingness to vaccinate is too low to reach satisfactory vaccination coverage to stop the spread of the disease. There have been a number of interesting studies exploring the willingness of stakeholders (typically livestock farmers) to vaccinate and the factors that infl uence this decision. These include studies on Bluetongue in the Netherlands [ 168 ] , poultry vaccination in developing countries [ 169 ] and farmers' confi dence in vaccinating badgers as a means to controlling bTB in cattle in the UK [ 170 ] . Important lessons emerge from these studies, such as the importance of fi nancial incentives and when they should be applied during a disease control program, the characteristics of the disease, farmers' perceptions of disease risk, the effi cacy of the vaccine and other available control options, the availability of resources, and the existence and effectiveness of the veterinary infrastructure, and the wider social and political context. Where there is little incentive to use a vaccine, the best endeavors can fail. An excellent example of this is the vaccination of cattle against E. coli O157:H7, reviewed recently by Matthews et al. [ 171 ] . These authors point out that in Canada, where the fi rst E. coli O157:H7 vaccine was developed and fully licensed, uptake of the vaccine is currently less than 5 % of the market. The authors suggest that this is a likely consequence of the fact that the infection causes no clinical disease in cattle. Therefore, there is little economic incentive for the farmer who bears the cost of vaccination, but receives no direct perceived benefi t. For a wider consideration of the economics of veterinary vaccination, the reader is also referred to the review of McLeod and Rushton [ 172 ] .",
