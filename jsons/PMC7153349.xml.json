            "text": "In this chapter the interactions between populations affected by different diseases are discussed. In the last years, in the globalized world it has become increasingly important to propose prompt suitable actions whenever an infectious disease starts to spread. In fact it has been estimated that, whereas in the 19th century an infectious disease took about 18 months to spread all over the world, in the recent years it takes less than 36 h, less than the incubation period of most of the diseases. Moreover, the world population has increased in the same period by about five times and almost 400 million people travel to another country or region every year, thus becoming possible transmission vehicles. A classical classification for epidemics refers to epidemic disease, when it is limited both from geographic and temporal point of view, pandemic disease, limited from a temporal point of view but potentially spreading in an entire continent, sporadic case, an irregular (in time and space) presence of an epidemic-like disease, and endemic disease, bounded from a space point of view but not referring to a specific time. Various attempts have been made in the last years to study the spread of epidemic diseases; the main problem is to understand and describe the modalities of the geographic spread among nations with different social characteristics and health status, as well as the effects of migration phenomena.",

These interactions may be suitably modeled as additional changes in the parameter values and by introducing additional inputs as sum of the effects of migration.",

            "text": "The case study analyzed in this chapter is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is responsible for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); it infects cells of the immune system, destroying or impairing their function: the immune system becomes weaker, and the person is more susceptible to infections. AIDS is the most advanced stage of the HIV infection and could be reached in 10\u201315 years from the infection. It can be transmitted only by some body fluids: blood, semen, preseminal fluid, rectal fluid, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. The data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed the dangerousness of the HIV, an estimated 1.2 million of people have died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide in 2014 (last update); in the same period the number of people living with HIV-AIDS was about 37 million. A significant aspect is that only 54% of people with HIV is aware of the infection. Currently no vaccine exists and the treatment consists in standard antiretroviral therapy to maximally suppress the HIV virus and stop its progression; use of condom and regular analysis of the subjects belonging to risk categories could help in contrasting the spread of this pandemia. The HIV/AIDS virus suitably represents the situation at hand: a virus spreading all over the world but with different levels of dangerousness depending on the population interested; the social, economic, and cultural habits may strongly vary the dynamics among the different categories of subjects. The HIV/AIDS is generally studied by considering compartmental modeling, that is, dividing the population into groups homogeneous with respect to the level of disease, as discussed in the following sections. In general susceptible individuals and infected ones are considered, splitting each class depending on the specific characteristics to be discussed; due to the long nonsymptom period, among the infected individuals there are those who are not aware of their situation and the ones in the pre-AIDS and AIDS conditions. Due to its dangerousness, an effective control is required to interrupt the spread, by putting together two characteristics: wise behavior and the fast detection of the infection so that the virus does not spread. Three possible actions are suggested by the WHO; they represent different levels of prevention: \u2022\nPrimary prevention: It is designed for healthy people to reduce the possibility of new infections.\u2022\nSecondary prevention: It is devoted to a fast identification of new infections and risk conditions to improve the percentage of subjects who become aware of their illness by regular blood tests.\u2022\nTertiary prevention: It is the medication to the infected subjects who are aware of infection.\n",

            "text": "The HIV/AIDS virus spread is considered in this chapter as the disease that could affect a population. Available models of HIV-AIDS infection may be divided into two main groups: one focuses on the dynamics at cell levels (Chang and Astolfi, 2009; Mascio et al., 2004; Wodarz, 2001; Wodarz and Nowak, 1999) and the other deals with the dynamic of subject interactions (Naresh et al., 2009; Pinto and Rocha, 2012). In the first approach, it is considered that in an HIV positive subject the virus infects the CD4 T-cells in the blood; when the number of these cells is below 200 per mm3 the HIV patient is diagnosed with AIDS. The model by Wodarz (2001) includes the uninfected and the infected CD4 T-cells, the concentration of helper-independent and of the helper-dependent cells, and the concentration of the precursors. The attention is focused on the analysis of the two equilibrium points, one corresponds to the AIDS status and the other to the long-term nonprogressor (LTNP). The same model has been simplified by Chang and Astolfi (2009), by introducing the effects of cytotoxic T lymphocyte, to drive the HIV patient state into the LTNP region of attraction. A double control action aimed at delaying the virus progression and boosting the immune system was proposed by Joshi (2002), whereas by Zhou et al. (2014) have established an idea to reduce the number of virus particles, besides increasing the number of uninfected CD4 T-cells.",

            "text": "The second approach is the one followed in this chapter; generally four categories are introduced: the susceptible one (S), that is, the subjects who are not yet infected but may contract the virus, the infected one (I) containing subjects with HIV but are not aware of the infection, the HIV subjects who are the pre-AIDS patients (P), and the AIDS patients (A). The four-class model by Naresh et al. (2009) considers a constant inflow of HIV-infected subjects assuming birth balancing death and migration. Also natural death is introduced; from the S class a subject could go to the I or P class, whereas in the I class the subjects could discover to be in the pre-AIDS class (P) or in the AIDS one (A). A dynamic compartmental simulation model for Botswana and India by Nagelkerke et al. (2002) considers sex behavioral compartment, high risk and low risk, to identify the best strategies for preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. As discussed in Section 3, in this work the model adopted is the one introduced by Di Giamberardino et al. (2018); two classes of noninfected subjects are introduced by splitting the S class considering the subjects who are not aware of irresponsible acts and, therefore, could contract the virus, and the subjects representing the wise population who, suitably informed, try to avoid dangerous behaviors. Therefore, in the considered approach, the first level of prevention corresponds to the information effort and the use of wise attitudes to assist the noninfected subjects in avoiding the acquisition of the HIV infection. The interaction between populations with different diseases is an interesting topic in a globalized world and requires prompt suitable action (Dadlani et al., 2014; Naresh et al., 2009; Tanaka and Urabe, 2014). A survey on the possible approaches to face the problem of spreading processes was presented by Nowzari et al. (2016); in particular, the concepts of network and metapopulation models are discussed, as well as deterministic and stochastic ones. It is also emphasized that the same kind of modeling could be efficiently applied to spreading processing regarding information propagation through social network, viral marketing, and malware spreading.",

With such a classification, the first group is mainly responsible for the virus propagation. In addition to the susceptible individuals, the model considers the infected subjects, I, the individuals who are infected but do not know their illness status. They represent the most dangerous class, since they can have sexual relationships with the unwise susceptible individuals S\n1 and so spread the infection. The diagnosed patients are divided into two classes: the P class and the A class, the first one represents the individuals who are diagnosed with HIV (pre-AIDS) condition, the latter contain the ones with a diagnosis of AIDS.",

Some of the results are reported in Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig. 17\n. In all the figures, the case u\n2 = 0, the uncontrolled case, is depicted by the dashed line, for comparative purpose with the other increasing values. Figs. 10 and 11 show the time histories of the two state components S\n1(t) and I(t), for different input values. Although monotonical increment in the individuals S\n1(t) as u\n2 increases is expected, as well as the corresponding decrement in the infected subjects I(t), there are two interesting results which the figures show. The first is the appearance of the oscillatory behavior which is related to the amplitude of the input u\n2. This kind of time evolution is well evidenced referring to Fig. 14, where the trajectories in the plane I(t) + P(t) + A(t) versus S\n1(t) + S\n2(t) is plotted: the spiral trajectory while converging to the equilibrium point is clearly visible. This means that, under input u\n2 \u2260 0, there are time instants in which the number of the infected individuals I(t) can seem greater than expected, but it is related to the transient behavior only. The second result puts in evidence from the numerical simulations is that the number of diagnosed infected individuals P(t) and A(t) do not decrease as I(t) decreases. This is due to the fact that the action of the control u\n2 aims at increasing the number of diagnoses, so that while I(t) decreases, people moves to P(t) (Fig. 12) and A(t) (Fig. 13). The overall effects on the total population is shown in Fig. 15, where its increment is clear. While the total population increases, the fraction of healthy people S\n1(t) + S\n2(t) with respect to the total population strongly increases, as reported in Fig. 16 and, at the same time, the fraction of diagnosed patients P(t) + A(t) significantly decreases (Fig. 17).",

For the first point \u03be1e(m1,n1), the Jacobian matrix computed in the equilibrium point is the same as for the isolated unforced case \u03be1e in Eq. (5). Its expression is given in Eq. (7) and the same stability conditions can be obtained: the equilibrium point \u03be1e(m1,n1) is locally asymptotically stable under condition (9). For the second equilibrium point \u03be2e(m1,n1) in Eq. (57), the dynamical matrix of the linear approximation has the structure(64)with A222(m1,n1) equal to the one in Eq. (12) for the isolated unforced case, for which the two eigenvalues, \u03bb\n4 = \u2212(\u03b1\n1 + d) and \u03bb\n5 = \u2212(\u03b1 + d), are real negative. Then, for the stability conditions, matrix (65)A211(m1,n1)=\u2212d\u2212c\u03b2KI2(1+KI)2\u03b3+c\u03b2KI(1+KI)2\u2212c\u03b21(1+KI)20\u2212(\u03b3+d)0c\u03b2KI2(1+KI)2\u2212c\u03b2KI(1+KI)2c\u03b21(1+KI)2\u2212(d+\u03b4)must be analyzed. It is interesting to note that it does not depend on the coefficients m\n1 or n\n1; then, the same holds for the stability of the equilibrium points obtained by varying such coefficients. One of the eigenvalues of Eq. (65), \u03bb\n3 = \u2212(\u03b3 + d) < 0, is evident from the structure. The other two can be computed as the roots of the polynomial equation (66)\u03bb2+d+(d+\u03b4)\u2212c\u03b21\u2212KI2(1+KI)2\u03bb+d(d+\u03b4)+c\u03b2(d+\u03b4)KI2\u2212d(1+KI)2or, by replacing the full expression for K\nI and performing all the simplifications, (67)\u03bb2+(c\u03b2\u2212\u03b4)\u03bb+(d+\u03b4)(c\u03b2\u2212\u03b4)c\u03b2\u2212(d+\u03b4)c\u03b2=0which is the same as Eq. (13). On the basis of the discussion in Section 4.2, it is possible to conclude that the condition for the local asymptotic stability for \u03be2e(m1,n1) does not depend on m\n1 and n\n1 and it is the same as given in Eq. (14). Moreover, the same relationships between existence and stability of the two equilibrium points, as in Section 4.2 for \u03be1e and \u03be2e, hold.",

The results are reported in Fig. 27, Fig. 28, Fig. 29, Fig. 30, Fig. 31\n. In particular, Fig. 27 depicts the evolution of the number of unwise healthy population S\n1(t) when m\n1 changes and Fig. 28 reports the same cases for m\n1, starting from zero (corresponding to the dashed lines) and increasing its value. The evolution of S\n2(t) is not reported because for the initial condition chosen it is constant and equal to zero. Also the time histories of P(t) and A(t) are omitted since they have the same shape of I(t). The obvious result that can be evidenced from Fig. 27 is that the number of healthy people increases as m\n1 grows; unfortunately, this increment makes the infected individuals I(t) grow too. However, a very interesting behavior of the system can be observed once the evolution of the fraction of diagnosed infected patients P(t) + A(t) w.r.t. the total population is determined, varying m\n1, as reported in Fig. 29. From these plots it can be seen that, under the hypothesis of an immigration of healthy people driven by the health of the total population, the different values of m\n1 affects the transient behavior only, reaching, for all m\n1, the same steady-state value. The same result can be observed in Fig. 30, where the fraction of the healthy population S\n1(t) + S\n2(t) w.r.t. the total one is reported: also in this case, the steady-state value is the same. Thus, it is possible to conclude that, for the model considered, an immigration of healthy individuals makes the population grow, as evidenced in Fig. 31; each of the classes grows (Figs. 27 and 28) but the fraction of healthy population as well as the fraction of infected one tends to remain unchanged even if the rate of immigration (m\n1) increases.",

This represents an emigration of healthy people based on the presence of infection in the population. As expected, both S\n1(t) and I(t) decrease, as reported in Figs. 32 and 33, respectively, I(t) more sensibly than S\n1(t). However, in this case also the percentage of infected subjects, plotted in Fig. 34, and the one of healthy individuals, depicted in Fig. 35, tend to remain unchanged as n\n1 changes, having the same steady-state values. Differently from the case of variation of m\n1, in this case the transients present a higher amplitudes as n\n1 increases. This result can be used to better understand the actual dangerousness of the phenomenon, since high values of relative infected individuals can be limited to finite time intervals, during the transient, and may not represent a real social alarm situation. Fig. 36 shows that in this case the total population decreases as the emigration rate increases, but with oscillations during the transient with increasing amplitude.",

Following the same order as in the previous cases, Figs. 42 and 43 depict the time history of S\n1(t) and I(t), respectively. As expected, the steady-state values of the uninfected individuals S\n1(t) increase while for the infected I(t) a more sensible decrement could be observed. The transient, as in the case of emigration from S\n1(t), is characterized by a high oscillatory behavior, in this case more accentuated than that shown in Figs. 32 and 33. Correspondingly, the fraction of diagnosed infected people with respect to the total population decreases for higher values of n\n3 and, at the same time, the relative number of uninfected individuals increases, once their steady-state behavior is observed as shown in Figs. 43 and 45. But in the same figures, the transients show a very large variations in the components. This fact proves the necessity to have a reliable mathematical model to be able to predict some unexpected behaviors or to explain the presence of values in some time intervals that, intuitively, are not obvious. This is well evidenced in Fig. 46, in which, without the support of a model, it is not easy to justify the large variations in the total population as the time passes.",

However, at steady state, the ratio of the healthy population and the one of infected individuals with respect to the total one is constant.(ii)Emigration involving the same population as in Case (i) implies an evolution opposite to the previous one, with a decrement in people in all classes, leading, at steady state, again to constant ratios, but with the presence of oscillations in the transient. This peculiar behavior is interesting to be stressed since there are time intervals with increment in individuals, healthy and infected, despite the emigration phenomena. This fact does not characterizes the behavior of the dynamics when the vaccination, which acts on the same subjects, is applied.(iii)When the immigration involves infected people unaware of their status, the effect is the expected one: the number of healthy people decreases while all the infected ones increase. This produces an increment in the total population, but it is due to a higher number of infected individuals.(iv)The emigration among people of the same class as in Case (iii) at steady state shows the opposite behavior with respect to the previous case, as expected. However, the transient is characterized by an oscillatory behavior, as in the Case (ii); this fact implies that a correct interpretation of the population dynamics cannot be correctly performed over short-time period.\n",

These results are obtained starting from the development of the analysis for the single group dynamics modeling each interaction as additional inputs and/or changes in the parameter values. Such effects can be modeled as constant fluxes, which introduce additive constant terms in the dynamics, or can be supposed to be driven by some characteristic of the group behavior, such as a higher or lower level of healthy, for example. As case study, the epidemic spread considered is the HIV-AIDS, assuming a new model in which the classical scheme that includes susceptible people and three classes of infected ones (infected but not aware of their status, patients in the pre-AIDS and AIDS conditions) is enriched by splitting the class of susceptible individuals into those aware of the risks of this virus and those who adopt irresponsible acts. The proposed analysis, particularly suitable in describing, for the chosen model, the migration phenomena, is useful to predict unexpected behaviors especially in the transient period in which oscillatory behaviors for the classes of infected patients appear, as evidenced in the discussion.",
