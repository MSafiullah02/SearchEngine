These SQGs are useful for a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multichemical hazard quotient methods (probable effect concentration [PEC]-Q avg , PEC-Q met , and PEC-Q sum ) and a novel (hazard score [HZD]) approach were used in conjunction with a consensus-based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high flow sand, and silt. For high flow sand and gravel, no significant dose-response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose-response relationships were observed for chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low flow sand and silt habitats. For silt habitats, the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of chironomid abundances compared to various PEC-Q methods according to goodness-of-fit tests. For low flow sand habitats, PEC-Q sum followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent chironomid toxicity between the 2 habitats suggest habitat-specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an IBI method, the HZD, PEC-Q avg , and PEC-Q met approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low flow sand habitats but not for gravel or high flow sands. Computation differences between the various multi-chemical toxicity scoring metrics and how this contributes to bias in different estimates of chemical mixture toxicity scores are discussed and compared.

Typical LOEs include bulk sediment chemistry, toxicity tests, bioaccumulation tests, and benthic community composition (Chapman and Anderson 2005) . Within the LOE approach, numerical sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) are used as screening tools to assist in interpreting sediment chemistry data (Long et al. 2006; Ritter et al. 2011) . By using multiple LOEs, a weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of site contamination can be useful for a complete understanding of sediment contaminant impacts. Although SQGs are typically assigned according to jurisdictions, interjurisdictional SQGs exhibit wide ranges of chemical concentrations that can span 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in their predicted dose-response for a given chemical (MacDonald et al. 2000) . SQGs are most commonly developed and assessed using standardized sediment toxicity assays (e.g., amphipod toxicity, Microtox 1 bioluminescence, sea urchin fertilization tests) that are meant to serve as surrogates for actual benthic species (Wenning et al. 2005) . Given that these tests are carried out under controlled laboratory conditions, it is difficult to determine how accurately the SQGs can predict toxicity under more complex field conditions, which include a diversity of environmental (e.g., site-specific differences in chemical bioavailability) and ecological attributes as well as complex chemical mixture effects (Chapman 1996; Bay and Weisberg 2010) . Given that the purpose of SQGs is to provide a screening level assessment of in situ toxicity, it is imperative that attempts at field assessment of SQGs be carried out on a regular basis and cover multiple environment types (Ritter et al. 2011; Bay et al. 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 169, "text": "(Long et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 291, "end": 318, "text": "(Chapman and Anderson 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 469, "end": 487, "text": "(Long et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 488, "end": 507, "text": "Ritter et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 902, "end": 925, "text": "(MacDonald et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1190, "text": "(Wenning et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1572, "text": "(Chapman 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1595, "text": "Bay and Weisberg 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1843, "text": "(Ritter et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1860, "text": "Bay et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "To establish a proper methodology for the field assessment of a set of SQGs, both environment (habitat) and chemical mixture interactions need to be taken into consideration.

For example, in a review of SQGs, Long et al. (2006) indicated the need for increased understanding of habitat-specific local features such as particle size, depth, and velocity in addition to chemical-specific stressors on the benthic community. Habitat classification is more commonly considered in surveys designed to assess benthic community structure such as with the reference condition approach (RCA). These approaches provide a multivariate means of matching habitat attributes in a sample test location against a library of reference sites before evaluating for differences in benthic community composition at the test location (Wright 1995; Parsons and Norris 1996; Reynoldson et al. 1997) . Presumably, comparable approaches to habitat-matching could be adopted under a field SQG assessment, although the use of such a strategy seems to be uncommon. In such a case, doseresponse relationships in the numerical presence of a habitatappropriate indicator species or community composition can be evaluated across a gradient of chemical contamination measured within a given habitat type. Applying such a methodology for field SQG assessment may also have the advantage of being able to examine for differences in the performance of SQGs between habitat types and in the identification of site-specific indicator species.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 347, "end": 360, "text": "(Wright 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 361, "end": 385, "text": "Parsons and Norris 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 386, "end": 408, "text": "Reynoldson et al. 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 409, "end": 433, "text": "Reynoldson et al. , 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 470, "end": 488, "text": "Long et al.

These chemical-specific differences can lead to disparate patterns in contamination where presumably \"clean\" conditions for one chemical of study may be highly degraded for another. There exist several hazard quotient approaches currently available that combine SQGs and site-specific contaminant measurements for multiple chemicals to compute a single toxicity score. However, all toxicity score computation methods incorporate sets of assumptions that can introduce anomalies that bias toxicity assessment toward over-or underestimation of the actual site-specific toxicity. For example, most studies adopting a hazard quotient approach consider deviations in site-specific chemical residues with SQGs attributed to high biological impact (e.g., the severe effect concentration [SEC] or probable effect concentration [PEC] ) but ignore SQGs for the same chemicals that are associated with more conservative estimates of toxicity (e.g., threshold effect concentration [TEC] or low effect concentration [LEC] ). Thus, hazard quotient approaches, by default, assume a linear dose-response relationship that is based on one calibration point even though toxicity related to animal mortality often takes on a sigmoidal distribution that necessitate multiple calibration points (MacDonald et al. 2000; Ritter et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1025, "end": 1030, "text": "[SEC]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1069, "text": "[PEC]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1219, "text": "[TEC]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1253, "text": "[LEC]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1542, "text": "(MacDonald et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1562, "text": "Ritter et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Similarly, toxicity score metrics differ in their computation schemes that make the method more or less sensitive to the number of chemicals included and/or diversity of chemical signatures generated in a given survey. For example, different toxicity score metrics consider the sum, average, or weighted average hazard quotients for sets of priority contaminants. Toxicity scores generated as the sum of hazard quotients can be biased to overpredicting toxicity when many chemicals are included in the metric even when all of the chemicals are below the SQGs at a given location. Metrics generated by an average hazard quotient approach can lead to underestimates of toxicity when several chemicals have very low site-specific concentrations. These low concentration chemicals can effectively dilute the toxicity score value even when 1 or more contaminant concentrations exceed their SQGs for high biological impact. One of the objectives of this study was to introduce an alternative toxicity score metric, henceforth identified as the hazard score (HZD) metric, which assumes a sigmoidal toxicity distribution, adopts a multipoint calibration scheme based on existing SQGs, and establishes a threshold effect concentration, below which chemicals included in the metric have no influence on the summed toxicity score. This new toxicity metric is then compared with more classic multi-chemical hazard quotient (designated as PEC-quotient or PEC-Q) approaches to determine, which metric if any, provides the best prediction of field toxicity as evaluated using field assessment data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Field assessment data used for this study were generated from a combined high resolution (n \u00bc 150 sampling stations) sediment chemistry and benthic community assessment survey conducted for the Detroit River. First, a habitat classification scheme was developed that used a multivariate approach to designate distinct sediment habitat types within the Detroit River survey locations using habitat variables previously described as being important to benthic community structure. Following this, the benthic community database was used to identify potential benthic invertebrate indicators within each habitat type by choosing organisms that demonstrated high association, high abundance (but also high variation in abundance) across sample locations of a given habitat. The relative abundance of each benthic invertebrate indicator was then used as a surrogate measure of \"field toxicity\" and compared with the different SQGbased toxicity score metrics. In addition, a multi-metric IBI was developed for each unique habitat type of the Detroit River according to the methods described by Reynoldson et al. (1997) . The habitat-specific IBIs were also contrasted with each of the SQG-based toxicity scores to determine which, if any, showed the strongest correlations.

Surface sediments were collected using a petite Ponar grab sampler, whereupon multiple grabs were used to provide a standardized total volume of 2 L of sediment. Water depth was measured on site. Bottom water velocity was estimated from a previously developed 3D hydrological model (Reitsma et al. 2003) . Sediment samples were analyzed for physical (TOC, silt, sand, and gravel), chemical (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Hg, Ni, Zn, hexachlorobenzene [HCB] , DDE, total PCBs, and total PAHs) and benthic community data (Table 1) . Complete physicochemical analytical methods are described by Drouillard et al. (2006) and Szalinska et al. (2006) . A second 2 L sediment sample from each sample location was collected by similar methods. Samples were coarsely sieved (600 mm) at the sampling location to remove most of the fine materials, and the contents of the sieve bucket were emptied into a plastic bag and preserved with Kahle's solution.

The first 2 components of the PCA were found to cumulatively explain 78.5% of the variation in the data (Table S2 ). Depth, velocity and gravel were strongly associated with the PC1 axis, and TOC, sand, and silt were associated with the PC2 axis. No variables showed strong associations with PCA axes 3, 4, and 5 and given that these axes contributed limited amounts to the variation in the data, they were ignored in habitat characterization. After examining the clustering of sites across the first 2 PCA axes, 4 main habitat types were identified consisting of silt (Silt), low velocity sand (LSand), high velocity sand (HSand), and gravel (Grav) (Figure 2A) . Initially, stations were clustered into the habitat types by manually drawing ellipses around similarly ordinated stations as defined by their scores on the PC1 and PC2 axes. DFA was subsequently used to test the assignment of habitat type for each station into the 4 major habitat types. Initial DFA indicated 85% of sites were correctly classified within the user-identified habitats. After reclassification of improperly classified sites, a second DFA indicated 95% of sites were correctly identified (Table S3 ). All sites identified by habitat via DFA were used for further analysis ( Figure 2B ). Among the 136 stations included in the analysis, 124 stations could be assigned to a habitat type with a 95% confidence. The remaining stations, of unknown or mixed habitat association, were censored from further analysis. Each of the Silt, LSand, HSand, and Grav habitats had 33, 45, 28, and 18 total sites, respectively. Generally, habitats were distributed as expected, with the gravel and/or high flow sand areas found within the upper reach and silt/low flow sand areas generally within the lower reach or near depositional zones of islands ( Figure 1 ). An important step in the determination of benthic community impairment is the identification of groups of habitats with similar characteristics (Long et al. 2006) . Of the 15 measured environmental variables, only 6 were needed to delineate the 4 distinct habitats: depth, velocity, TOC, and grain sizes (gravel, sand, and silt) ( Table 1) .

In addition, the slope of the regression line (m \u00bc 0.51) more closely fit the 1:1 expectation indicating that it is had lower bias compared to the 3 PEC-Q methods. For the PEC-Q approaches, the PEC-Q avg was generally too conservative. Several sites generated low toxicity predictions but also contained very low abundance or a complete absence of the benthic indicator. The PEC-Q sum was overly sensitive with several sites predicted to have 100% toxicity whereas field abundance of chironomids were relatively high.

Unlike the Chironomidae abundance, there is no expected 1:1 relationship between the SQG scores and IBI values, thus the proximity of the slope to a value of 1 provides no guidance to evaluating goodness-of-fit tests. Overall, both the Chironomidae abundance (field toxicity) and IBI approaches showed reasonable correlations with the HZD, PEC-Q avg , and PEC-Q met SQG scoring metrics.

However, this metric also tended to under predict toxicity at many sites.

As with the Silt habitat, the LSand Chironomidae toxicity and IBI approaches showed reasonable correlations with the HZD, PEC-Q avg , and PEC-Q met (as well as PEC-Q sum ) SQG scoring metrics. In this case, HZD provided the strongest predictive capability for Chironomidae abundance (followed closely by PEC-Q sum ) whereas HZD, PEC-Q avg , and PEC-Q met scoring methods explained similar amounts of variation in IBI score values.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Goodness-of-fit tests"}, {"text": "The differences in the ability of the various hazard metrics to estimate abundance of Chironomidae between habitats may be suggestive of differences in chemical bioavailability. Hence, Chironomidae are apparently more sensitive with respect to their abundance in LSand habitats as compared to Silt habitats for the same degree of sediment contamination. This is consistent with higher organic carbon content in Silt contributing to a higher degree of chemical sequestering and lower overall contaminant bioavailability. However, these differences may also be a product of an oversimplification of the habitat classification method. Although the selection of variables included in the habitat model were demonstrated to be relevant habitat predictors within the literature, benthic invertebrates within the study system may track habitats at a finer scale then what classification would model would suggest and errors in true habitat classification would contribute to additional variation in the goodness-of-fit test. This could be one reason for the failure to find any associations between priority contaminant concentrations and indicator abundances in the Grav and HSand habitats. Differences between toxicity score predictions across the hazard metrics as contrasted in this study are due to the differences in their computation. Averaging hazard quotients across chemicals (PEC-Q avg ) results in conservative toxicity estimates, particularly when several chemicals are found in sediments at low concentrations relative to their PEC-Q values. Thus, averaging causes \"dilution\" of the overall score and consistently produces the lowest toxicity prediction. For the Chironomidae indicator in Silt and LSand, the PEC-Q avg was the poorest predictor of indicator abundance. Alternatively, PEC-Q sum can result in overly sensitive predictions of toxicity when several chemicals are present at low concentrations. In this case, the likelihood of exceeding an effect criterion, even when no field toxicity occurs, increases as the number of chemicals added to the metric increases. PEC-Q sum overestimated Chironomidae toxicity in Silt habitats but provided the second best prediction of indicator abundances in the LSand habitat where indicator sensitivity to contamination was apparently higher. Both the PEC-Q avg and PEC-Q sum could be improved by adopting the TEC-censoring algorithm used within the HZD methodology. Censoring chemicals that are present in sediments at concentrations less than the TEC value would increase the overall score for PEC-Q avg and decrease that of PEC-Q sum . However, the dilution artifact introduced by PEC-Q avg can still present problems especially under the extreme case where only a single contaminant is present at high enough concentrations to elicit strong toxicological response. The PEC-Q met provides an intermediate toxicity prediction given that metals are treated as a single contaminant whereas variations in organic chemical scores are given more weight in the algorithm. The PEC-Q met is expected to be more appropriate when organic contaminants contribute to a larger proportion of sediment toxicity. It was the second best predictor of chironomid abundances in the Silt habitat and 3rd best predictor in LSand habitats whereas this metric was the strongest predictor of IBI in Silt but poorest predictor in LSand. PEC-Q met could also benefit from adopting the TEC censoring method.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Goodness-of-fit tests"}, {"text": "For the HZD method, its use of a sigmoidal toxicity curve contributes to further differences in toxicity predictions compared to each of PEC-Q x approaches. Figure S6 contrasts % toxicity predicted for a single contaminant (PCBs) over a theoretical range of sediment concentrations using HZD (Eqn. 6 and the TEC censoring algorithm) and PEC-Q PCB . As demonstrated by the figure, HZD generates a lower toxicity estimate compared to PEC-Q PCB when sediment concentrations of PCBs are between the TEC and PEC value and a higher estimate of toxicity for sediment concentrations exceeding PEC up to the 93% toxicity estimate where both toxicity curves intersect and eventually become maximized at 100% toxicity. When applied on a multichemical basis, HZD will therefore tend to produce lower toxicity estimates when several chemicals are less than PEC and higher toxicity estimates when multiple chemicals exceed their respective Values are significant at p < 0.10. PEC. Relative to PEC-Q x approaches, the HZD suffers from its greater complexity in its computation. Finally, each hazard metric approach can be potentially improved by calibration. In the present study, the PEC concentration was arbitrarily set to a 50% toxicity value. However, the value of toxicity associated with the PEC concentration can be set to other toxicity values and potentially optimized to establish a best fit to a calibration data set. Preliminary trials were carried out using the HZD score by adjustment of PEC toxicity equivalents in the range of 25% to 75%. However, these adjustments were not found to make substantial improvements in goodness to fit test outcomes for chironomid abundances in this system. Furthermore, given the differences in sensitivity of chironomids to sediment contamination between habitats it is clear than no single optimized value is likely to work across all environments nor would this be applicable to other types of benthic indicator species. Table 4 presents estimates of SQG-based toxicity score values for each of the computed metrics that correspond with the 50% field toxicity estimate for Chironomidae abundance in Silt and Sand habitats of the Detroit River based on goodness-of-fit tests. Thus, for Silt-type habitats, stations having a computed HZD score greater than 54.1% might be considered potentially toxic with respect to chironomid abundances, whereas in LSand environments, a lower HZD score of 32.3% or greater might be considered potentially toxic. Table 4 also presents SQG-based toxicity metric scores that correspond to the median IBI scores achieved in these 2 habitat types. In this case, a HZD score of 65.2% and 50.6% will generate a median IBI scored for each respective habitat type. Such information could prove useful for setting site and habitat-specific criteria or remediation goals using a multichemical metric approach. Thus, in Silt, HZD scores exceeding 50% are more likely to be considered toxic both from an indicator abundance perspective as well as have a higher likelihood of achieving lower IBI scores. In LSand habitats, HAZ scores exceeding 30% may be useful for designating the potential for biological impacts. Table 4 also summarizes the score values for 50% chironomid toxicity and scores that achieve the median IBI in Silt and LSand for PEC-Q avg , PEC-Q met , and PEC-Q sum metrics. In the case of PEC-Q avg , the degraded condition values for indicator abundance and IBI range from 11.9% to 14.4% for Silt and 7.7% to 11.6% for LSand. Converting these values back to standard hazard quotient scales (achieved by dividing the %toxicity value by 50) yields PEQ-Q avg on an absolute scale in the range of 0.24 to 0.29 and 0.15 to 0.23. Notably, these protective values are much lower than the value of 1 commonly used in hazard quotient assessment methods.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 166, "text": "Figure S6", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1965, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 2483, "end": 2490, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 3173, "end": 3180, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Goodness-of-fit tests"}, {"text": "SQGs, such as those implemented by MDEQ, are useful for providing toxicity benchmarks on which to evaluate sediment contamination and potential of sediments to contribute to degraded benthos. However, these guidelines cannot be used appropriately without considering the interactive effects of mixtures of chemicals present in the field and different habitats present within the system. Various multicontaminant toxicity score approaches have been developed. However, different scoring methods generate different estimates of sediment toxicity and each computational approach contains within it assumptions that can contribute to biases in the prediction. This study demonstrated the applicability of some common multi-chemical multivariate scoring approaches for predicting benthic invertebrate abundance and indices of biological integrity (IBI) under field conditions. It further describes a new method (HZD) that adopts a multipoint calibration through incorporation of information provided by PEC and TEC benchmark values. The HZD score and individual PEC-Q approaches were capable of predicting Chironomidae abundances and IBI score values in 2 types of Detroit River habitats with varying degrees of success. The HZD approach provided the best estimate of chironomid abundance in silt habitat, whereas PEC-Q sum produced the best estimate of chironomid abundance in low flow sand habitats followed closely by the HZD score as the second best metric. As for the multivariate approaches, the multimetric IBI approach showed correlations in the Silt and LSand habitats for each of the SQG scoring metrics. However, none of the metrics were able to predict abundances of other organism groups and habitat types indicating some limitations of the toxicity interpretation of SQGs across habitat types and species. This implies that habitat-and taxonomic-specific SQGs are likely warranted. Overall, the universality of SQGs is generally limited by: 1) the types of organisms present in the local environment and their tolerance to contaminant and habitat quality; 2) differences in contaminant availability based on site physical and chemical characteristics; and 3) unknown toxicological interactions of multiple contaminants at a site. Overall, the SQG LOE screening can be useful as part of a full WOE assessment of sites to identify impacts of contamination on the sediment benthos. The method is made more powerful when habitat characteristics are considered within the SQG LOE assessment process and this has the added advantage of adopting consistency in approach with other LOEs that exclusively consider biological community composition alterations relative to habitat matched reference locations.
