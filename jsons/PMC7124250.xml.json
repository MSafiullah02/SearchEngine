            "text": "Many species of the genus Lactobacillus possess surface layer (S-layer) proteins which are arrays of a single protein noncovalently bound that constitute the outermost cell envelope also found in several members of Bacteria and Archaea. One of the main characteristics of Lactobacillus S-layer proteins is their high isoelectric point (pI) showing them as highly basic [1]. Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the major species found in human intestines and some strains have probiotic characteristics making them GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Probiotics are live microorganisms, usually contained in food, traditionally regarded as safe for human consume that, when ingested in sufficient number, play an important role in control of the host intestinal microbiota and in the modulation of the host immune response. L. acidophilus ATCC4356 has been described as a probiotic strain [2] with a 45 kDa S-layer protein highly basic with a calculated pI of 9.59, (Expasy) that was recently showed to have an antibacterial endopeptidase activity [3], [4]. S-layers have also been considered to function as protective coats, maintenance of cell shape and ion exchangers and be involved in adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces [5], [6]. Although many studies focus on the structure of the S-layer, their biological functions remains poorly understood. S-layer would account for the probiotic properties of some strains [7] being capable of influencing the immune response [8] and favoring cell adhesion [9], [10], [11], [12]. Several reports have involved the S-layer proteins in the enteric pathogen exclusion phenomena [13], [14].",

DCs play a very important role in the innate and adaptive immune response [16]. It has been shown that DC-SIGN can act enhancing viral entry of different viruses such as HIV type 1, hepatitis C, Ebola, Dengue and SARS [17], [18], [19]. It was also shown that DCs interact with L. acidophilus; this contact involve the DC-SIGN and the S-layer presented on the bacterial cell-envelope, and regulates the induction of a number of cytokines involved in cellular immune regulation [8], [20].",

AHF presents mortality rates from 20\u201330% and mainly affects population on the fertile farming land of Argentina [22]. It has been shown that JUNV uses the human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to infect human cells [23]. In addition to its primary receptor (TfR1), JUNV virus infection was shown to be enhanced by C-type lectins (Martinez & Candurra, unpublished results). Among the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and the Liver/lymph node\u2013specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) were studied. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are human homologs, share 77% of the amino-acid sequence and has function similarities. The role of these receptors (DC- and L-SIGN) in the infection of several major importance viruses placed them as a target for antiviral agents. The most common compounds used so far are carbohydrate-binding agents that can interact with the glycoprotein present on the virus surface and prevent the infection [24].",

In this work we evaluated the effect of the purified S-layer protein of L. acidophilus ATCC 4353 on JUNV infection to provide evidence on its role in pathogen exclusion and in the search for new antiviral agents with GRAS status. We used 3T3 cells stably expressing DC-SIGN, or its homolog L-SIGN or Vero cells for transient expression as in vitro models. Since 3T3 cells are poorly infect by JUNV in the absence of expression of C-type lectins this model provides a really strong tool to study the effect of S-layer protein on the infection enhanced by DC-SIGN or L-SIGN.",

The repeated sequences are a general theme for protein-carbohydrate interaction described for extracellular virulence factors of Gram positive bacteria [29]. SlpA protein sequence launched in CDART showed that the C-terminal part, Domain SLAP pfam03217, aligned with structural homology with putative CBD of a subgroup of bacterial protein homologous C-type lectin-like (CLECT or CTLD domain), protein domains homologous to the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of the C-type lectins (CLECT cd03603 and CLECT_VCBS cd00037) however bacterial CTLDs within this group are functionally uncharacterized. When only the amino-acid sequence of SLAP pfam03217 domain (127 aa C-terminal portion) was used as query for SMART analysis two internal repeats not previously revealed with the whole protein sequence, because they overlap with pfam domain, were actually found with good accuracy (E-value 3.43e-05). The two internal repeats showed 33% identity (Table 2\n). Total number of positively charged residues (Arg + Lys) within the repeats gives a predicted pI of 9.26 and 9.90 for each sequence and supports the carbohydrate binding capacity suggested (Table 2). When using I-TASSER for 3D structure and function prediction, result obtained showed similarity to Ca2+ binding protein. The Consensus Prediction of Gene Ontology terms obtain include functions of cell adhesion, protein binding and surface expression (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/output/S97651). In summary these analyses results suggest that the S-layer of L. acidophilus is predicted to have a carbohydrate binding capacity.",

This effect was not observed in cell lines that do not express this C-type lectin. Post infection treatments with S-layer did not have an effect in viral infection, leading to the idea that the inhibition caused by S-layer was due to an early effect during viral replication cycle. Since no virucidal effect was observed for the S-layer, it seems that the target is not the viral particle but the direct interaction with the DC-SIGN. This inhibitory effect is a novel characteristic of the S-layer protein of L. acidophilus, which could account for the pathogen exclusion effect described for this probiotic bacterium.

In fact no glycosylation was observed in the S-layer preparation (Fig. 3). It has been previously described that DC-SIGN forms a tetramer that enables multivalent interaction with pathogens. DC-SIGN-pathogen complex can be internalized into compartments with acid pH, and it was shown that there is a pH sensitive control of the oligomerization state of this complex [31].

            "text": "The interaction of the S-layer protein that lacks glycan strands with the DC-SIGN was predicted by bioinformatics methods. It is interesting to remark that this novel mechanism of interaction between SlpA that lacks glycan strands and the DC-SIGN resembles the interaction between non glycosylated C-type animal lectins with their ligands, for example galectin-1 protein [32]. This family of soluble proteins displays conserved CRD that recognizes glycans in its glycoprotein ligand. The repeating sequences described in SlpA (Table 2) are a general theme for protein\u2013carbohydrate interaction [29] and the S-layer protein is proposed to interact with carbohydrate moieties in a calcium dependant manner.",
