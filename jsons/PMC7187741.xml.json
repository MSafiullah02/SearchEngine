This can entail limiting individual rights and choices.(1) They assert that \u201cpublic health emergencies may feature tragically limited resources that are insufficient to save lives that under normal conditions could be saved\u201d.(1) This necessitates decisions about how to allocate limited resources: \u201cIn a public health emergency featuring severe respiratory illness, triage decisions may have to be made about level of care \u2026; initiation of life-sustaining treatment \u2026; withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment; and referral to palliative \u2026 care if life-sustaining treatment will not be initiated or is withdrawn\u201d.(1)",

However, clinicians here may be more accustomed to working with limited resources and rationing decisions, and the tension between the patient-centred and public health orientations might not be as unfamiliar or stark for them. However, this does not change the fact that triage decisions take their toll on health-care workers, emotionally. The Hastings Center asserts that one important way in which this emotional distress can be alleviated is by ensuring that there are clear rules in place for public health emergencies, for instance, \u201ctriage protocols \u2026 help first responders to swiftly prioritize patients for different levels of care based on their needs and their ability to respond to treatment given resource constraints\u201d.(1) Unclear rules or rules that cause patient distress can lead to moral distress in caregivers, especially in situations in which protocols require the withholding or withdrawing of treatment against the wishes of patients or their families. Thus, there is a critical need and an ethical obligation for ethics guidelines for decision-making about treatment allocation to be in place before the pandemic reaches the level where tragic choices need to be made.",

The biggest challenge it presents in our context relates to the existing inequalities in our health-care system, where the private sector is far better resourced than the public sector.

The reason for this is not because these individuals are more worthy than others, it is because they are instrumentally important in the response to the pandemic. Also, this assurance could encourage health-care workers to accept the higher risks and continue caring for patients in these circumstances.(2) Prioritizing health-care workers is even more justified in South Africa where we already have such a shortage of qualified practitioners. The authors also warn against possible abuses of the principle of giving regard to instrumental value by \u201cprioritizing wealthy or famous persons of the politically powerful above first responders and medical staff \u2026. Such abuses will undermine trust in the allocation framework\u201d.(2) This warning is particularly pertinent in our context in which corruption and nepotism are rife. Policies and procedures for the allocation of resources in this crisis need to clearly emphasize equity and fairness and exclude the prioritizing of persons of high social status, solely on the grounds of their status.",

Generally, they propose that this is not only ethically justified but also it is, in fact, morally obligatory.(2,4\u20136) Furthermore, Emanuel et al. claim that \u201cthe decision to withdraw a scarce resource to save others is not an act of killing and does not require the patient's consent\u201d. By now, it has become commonplace to make decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatment where patient or proxy consent is given, or (with or without consent) in cases where continued treatment is futile. Decisions of this nature are made in South Africa all the time. It is rare to make decisions to withdraw treatment that is not futile in order to make way for a patient with a better prognosis. However, this is clearly in-line with the principle of saving the most lives and maximizing the benefits of scarce resources in an emergency. If decisions like these will need to be made, it only serves to amplify the need for treating physicians to be protected by giving the responsibility for triage decisions to a separate committee. Furthermore, patients from whom treatment is withdrawn should be provided with appropriate palliative and supportive care.(4\u20136)",
