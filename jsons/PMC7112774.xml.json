            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality (Murray et al., 2001). Well recognized viral agents traditionally associated with respiratory tract infections are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1\u20133, and adenoviruses (Adv). Since 2001, improved virus discovery techniques have seen to the identification of several new viruses associated with acute respiratory tract infections including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (van den Hoogen et al., 2001), human coronaviruses (hCoV) HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) and NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004), and human bocavirus (hBoV) (Allander et al., 2005). At present, the most commonly used technique for the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections is cell culture usually in combination with direct immunofluorescence assays (IFA) (Fischbach and Dunning, 2009). Nucleic acid detection methods have recently become more readily available for the diagnosis of virus infections (Watzinger et al., 2006). Comparative studies have shown that for the detection of respiratory viruses real-time RT-PCR is significantly more sensitive than conventional detection methods (Gharabaghi et al., 2008, Kuypers et al., 2006, Smith et al., 2003, van de Pol et al., 2007). The majority of real-time RT-PCR detection assays for respiratory viruses are only qualitative of nature. Even though qualitative real-time PCR in the diagnostic setting has numerous advantages over more traditional detection methods, one of the limitations is that it does not discriminate between current infections or shedding of low concentration of virus from previous infections. The significance of co-infections is also not portrayed. In contrast, quantitative real-time PCR provides qualitative as well as quantitative information. The advantages of quantitative real-time PCR are that it permits the assessment of viral load at a given time point, facilitates the monitoring of response to treatment, and offers the possibility to determine the dynamics of virus proliferation (Watzinger et al., 2006). Quantitative tests may aid in the study of virus pathogenesis, development of vaccine and antiviral strategies, and will facilitate investigations of the importance of respiratory viruses when detected by themselves or as co-infections in patients.",

These studies employ the use of hydrolysis probes (Brittain-Long et al., 2008, Gunson et al., 2005) and molecular beacons (Templeton et al., 2004) as probe chemistry which are highly sensitive to hybridization mismatches. Due to the high mutation frequencies of respiratory viral genomes this may result in false negative results (Gunson et al., 2006). In contrast, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes can tolerate up to 6 mismatches (Zaayman et al., 2009). In addition, the probes are not hydrolyzed during the amplification reaction, thereby facilitating generation of amplicon-specific melting curves for further discrimination and incorporation of multiple targets per reaction.",

            "text": "Optimization of the multiplex assays was done on culture controls or on specimens that previously tested positive by PCR in independent laboratories. The newly designed real-time RT-PCR assays were initially optimized as monospecific assays. To assess the specificity of the primers and probes, the assays were tested for cross-reactivity among the 13 viruses using control specimens with viral loads of approximately 1 \u00d7 107\u20131 \u00d7 109 copies/ml. In all cases each virus was only detected by its specific primer and probe set, no cross-reaction was observed. The monospecific assays were subsequently combined to form four multiplex assays comprising of the following viruses: Multiplex 1\u2014RSV A and B, hMPV, hBoV; Multiplex 2\u2014parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, and 3, hCoV-NL63; Multiplex 3\u2014influenza A and B, adenovirus; Multiplex 4\u2014hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-229E. Viruses were combined into the various multiplex assays according to shared similarities in clinical manifestations and susceptible age groups. The sensitivity of the assays was determined in triplicate through the amplification of serially diluted in vitro transcribed RNA from cloned controls. Detection limits for RNA viruses ranged from 2.5 to 25 in vitro transcribed RNA copies/\u03bcl (corresponds to 2.5 \u00d7 103\u20132.5 \u00d7 104 copies/ml of specimen) and 25 plasmid DNA copies/\u03bcl for DNA viruses (corresponds to 2.5 \u00d7 104 copies/ml of specimen) (Table 2\n). Lower concentrations were detected, however, at these concentrations detection of all replicates could not be achieved and was therefore not considered true detection limits. To assess the inter-run precision of the respective assays, extraction and real-time RT-PCR detection were performed on triplicate aliquots from viral suspensions. Three independent real-time RT-PCR runs performed showed a coefficient of variation of between 0.03% and 3.05% (Table 2), indicating high reproducibility of the real-time RT-PCR assays. All four multiplexes were optimized to be performed under the same cycling conditions for simultaneous use. In the event that a 60-nt conserved region could not be identified, a technique described by Pont-Kingdon and Lyon (2005) was used to overcome this. This technique was applied to probes used for the detection of RSV A and B, and PIV-2.",

HBoV was previously identified in the positive control specimens by semi-nested PCR. In 4/9 specimens hBoV could not be detected by a single-round PCR. The detection limit of bocavirus by the real-time PCR is 25 copies/\u03bcl (2.5 \u00d7 104 copies/ml of specimen), suggesting high sensitivity although this is not as sensitive as the conventional semi-nested PCR by which it was initially detected (Smuts and Hardie, 2006). Application of the quantitative feature of this assay was demonstrated on RSV positive specimens from 32 children with mild disease (infants who visited outpatients but did not require hospitalization) and 26 children with severe disease (patients admitted to the intensive care unit) (Table 3\n). An association between higher viral loads and severe disease is demonstrated as the RSV viral load in patients with severe disease was significantly higher (p\n = 0.014) (mean: 3.35 \u00d7 1010 copies/ml, median 6.04 \u00d7 109 copies/ml) compared to patients with mild disease (mean: 3.44 \u00d7 109 copies/ml, 7.4 \u00d7 108 copies/ml).

Human bocavirus (n\n = 14), human metapneumovirus (n\n = 15), and human coronavirus NL63 (n\n = 5) were detected in the IFA negative group.

In addition, 79 (29.3%) of the IFA negative specimens tested positive for viruses already included in the IFA panel, suggesting a marked improved sensitivity over the IFA.

For the detection of respiratory viruses targeted by routine IFA, the multiplex assays were shown to be as specific as the routinely used commercial IFA but also to be significantly more sensitive, increasing the detection of these viruses by 29.3%. Inclusion of the additional respiratory viruses in the detection assay increased the overall detection frequency by a further 9.7%. Discrepant results in the study may be attributable to the increased sensitivity of real-time PCR. For the detection of RSV, a previous study reported 50\u201390% of specimens positive by PCR but negative by IFA had viral loads less than 1 \u00d7 106 copies/ml, suggesting a lower limit of sensitivity for IFA in this range (Kuypers et al., 2004). In this study, the assay demonstrated a detection limit ranging between 2.5 \u00d7 103 and 2.5 \u00d7 104 copies/ml, which is >2 logs lower than the approximate IFA detection limit. These detection limits should be fitting for the detection of respiratory viruses, as previously reported viral loads in respiratory specimens ranged between 1 \u00d7 103 and 1 \u00d7 1011 copies/ml (Kuypers et al., 2006).

In this study, semi-quantitative results of RSV positive patients with mild and severe disease demonstrated a significantly higher RSV viral load in patients with severe disease confirming the relevance of this feature and confirms previous findings for RSV (DeVincenzo et al., 2005, Fodha et al., 2007, Martin et al., 2008).

A pitfall of real-time PCR is that the more commonly used probe chemistries (hydrolysis probes and molecular beacons) are highly sensitive to mismatches, which may lead to false negative results if point mutations occur (Gunson et al., 2006). In contrast, the assays described in this study utilize two FRET hybridization probes which have the advantage of being able to tolerate a greater number of mismatches than hydrolysis probes or molecular beacons, decreasing the occurrence of false negative results substantially. The benefit of FRET probes was illustrated here; where point mutations were detected in the sites where the probe hybridized to the target template in several clinical specimens despite complete conservation of this area on GenBank. An obstacle when designing FRET hybridization probes is that a conserved area of approximately 60 nt is needed for the two probes to bind. In highly variable virus genomes this might pose a problem. However, this can be overcome by using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to conserved regions flanking a variable region as described by Pont-Kingdon and Lyon (2005). Binding of the probe brings the two conserved regions together, resulting in the variable region to loop out, thereby omitting variable sequences. If a 60-nt conserved region could not be identified, as was the case for RSV and PIV 2, this technique was successfully applied to overcome this complication.",

The test is currently optimized for the Light Cycler 2 but could be transferred to the Light Cycler 480 for 96-well format. For paediatric patients, rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infections can lead to improved management and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and length of hospitalization (Barenfanger et al., 2000, Woo et al., 1997). Rapid diagnosis is also imperative in managing nosocomial spread of respiratory viruses to high risk patients e.g. bone marrow transplant patients and cancer recipients (Hohenthal et al., 2001, Miall et al., 2002, Whimbey et al., 1995, Whimbey et al., 1997). In addition, the quantitative application of the assay will contribute to addressing questions on viral pathogenesis and may facilitate investigations of the importance of hMPV, hBoV and coronaviruses when detected by themselves or as co-infections in patients.",
