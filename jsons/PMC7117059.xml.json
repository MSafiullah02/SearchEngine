It was because Hong Kong had attracted many entrepreneurs from Shanghai and a large number of migrants from Guangdong. According to Ho and Liu [16], Hong Kong's population increased from around 600,000 in 1945 to 2.2 million in the mid of 1950s. The population figure increased to 4.1 million in 1971 and to 7.1 million in 2011 respectively [17].",

            "text": "In the 1960s, Hong Kong became a light-industrial center in Asia. With a large number of unskilled workers from nearby Guangdong, local entrepreneurs, and rich families fled from Shanghai in the 1950s, many light-metal, plastic, toys, textile, and garment factories were established. These factories employed hundreds of thousands labors [18]. The manufacturing sector had expanded steadily until early 1980s under a favorable environment, i.e. relatively low rent, low transportation cost, and low labor cost because of the abundant of unskilled workers. For example, more than 0.3 million unskilled migrants found their way either legally or illegally into Hong Kong's labor market between 1978 and 1980. However, as land price and labor cost increased substantially in early 1980s, Hong Kong's manufacturing sector shrank rapidly and many industrialists relocated their factories to mainland China in which the \u201copen-door policy\u201d has been implemented since 1978. Hong Kong started transforming itself to a logistic hub and its finance and service sector expanded rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. After almost two decades of transformation, Hong Kong succeeded to change itself from a manufacturing-based city to the busiest port in the world [19] as well as one of the world finance centers. Hong Kong's container terminals handled less than 0.7 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) in 1970 and steadily increased to handle 24.4 million TEU in 2011 [17]. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's economic development was once badly hit by the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in early 2003. In order to reboot Hong Kong's economy, the Central Government of the People's Republic of China decided to offer favorable treatments to Hong Kong under the CEPA (Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement). The CEPA agreement allows mainland visitors traveling to Hong Kong under the new Individual Visitor Scheme and encourages mainland companies to be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The number of mainland visitors surged rapidly to 18 million in 2009 and they spent HK$ 26 billion in that year [20]. In 2011, Hong Kong attracted 37.8 million visitors and 28 percent of visitors traveled to Hong Kong by flights [17]. Hong Kong becomes a tourist center and the world financial center in Asia. In aviation, the passenger throughput increased from 1.2 million to 46.3 million while the cargo throughput increased from 26.5 thousand tonnes to 3.742 million tonnes between 1967 and 2007 [21]. In 2011, the number of flights arriving and departing from the Hong Kong International Airport was 334,000. On road surfaces, the number of vehicles increased from 162,000 in 1971 to 630,281 in 2011 [22]. The number of private vehicles alone increased from 93,000 to 434,843 during this period.",

It shows that Hong Kong has transformed from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy in the past forty years. At the same time, Hong Kong's population increases at an average annual growth rate between 0.8 and 1.8 percent from 4.1 million in 1971 to 7.1 million in 2011. However, increase in population mostly comes from the net immigration rather than the number of new borne babies in Hong Kong [17]. This situation is expected to prevail in the future. As there are over 7.1 million living in Hong Kong and Hong Kong welcomes over 30 million visitors a year, their residential, social, business, and commercial activities consume a significant amount of energy [23], [24], [25]. Besides, Hong Kong is still one of the busiest ports in the world. All road, sea and air traffic consume a large amount of oil products and gas products. Table 1\nsummarizes the retained import of primary energy in 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011 respectively [26].

Heavy fuel oil was the main source of energy to generate electricity and to produce thermal energy in factories, hotels, hospitals, etc. From 1982 to 1995, Hong Kong's power companies consumed a significant amount of coals to generate electricity. In order to diversify the source of primary energy and to discharge less air pollutant to the environment, the Government of Hong Kong requested Hong Kong's power companies to use LNG in generating around 35 percent of electricity locally. Since 1995, a portion of electricity has been generated using LNG and has been imported from Shenzhen's Daya Bay Power Station.",

Visibility in Hong Kong has deteriorated continuously in the past decades while the net import of fossil fuel energy has increased by 10 times. Multiple regression analysis shows that the burning of aviation gasoline and kerosene significantly adversely affects visibility in Hong Kong, and burning of LPG and LNG moderately affects visibility. The effect of burning of other fossil fuels and meteorological factors on visibility on annual basis was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, correlation analysis between monthly visibility readings and monthly records of meteorological variables indicates that poor visibility was in general associated with lower air temperature i.e. the winter months in Hong Kong with higher mean atmospheric pressure and less or no rainfall. The findings of this study is consistent with the research works conducted recently in the United States and England [34], [35], [36] in which a significant amount (in terms of the number concentrations) of ultrafine particles were observed due to jet departures, jet landing, jet taxi and idle. Aircraft operations also produce a large amount of NOx (nitrogen oxides) and VOC (volatile organic compound) [35], [37].",

It is no doubt that air transport plays an important role in local economic development such as Hong Kong \u2013 one of the world finance centers, a regional tourism center, and the world's logistic hub. The Government of Hong Kong projects that traffic at the Hong Kong International Airport will increase to 490,000 in 2025 and planned to build the third runway to cope with the increased demand. However, it is expected that the number of hours of reduced visibility will increase to around 2117 by the Year 2025 (using Equation (2) and assuming the fuel consumption to be linearly proportional to the number of flights). It is almost impossible to Hong Kong to have a \u201cclear sky\u201d in future, especially between October and April, a period without high humidity, rains and storms to flush out ultrafine particulate pollutants.",
