            "text": "Accumulating evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in 25 several biological processes, including immune responses. However, the role of lncRNAs in 26 antiviral innate immune responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify an 27 uncharacterized human lncRNA, antivirus and activate neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly 28 up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically, nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively 29 regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) in cis by associating with its 30 promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil chemotaxis. Furthermore, 31 we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds tripartite motif containing 25 32 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 33 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby promoting TRIM25-and 34 RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. Collectively, these findings highlight the 35 potential clinical implications of lncRNA-AVAN as a key positive regulator of the antiviral 36 innate immune response and a promising target for developing broad antiviral therapeutics. 37 38 Keywords: long noncoding RNA, AVAN, virus immunity, FOXO3a, TRIM25 39 40 41 Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a large class of noncoding RNAs with no or limited 42 coding potential, are defined as functional RNAs that participate in a wide range of biological 43 processes, including cell and organ development, X-chromosome inactivation, tumor 44 proliferation, genomic imprinting, and stem cell self-renewal (1-10). lncRNAs are also 45 reportedly involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, such as immune cell 46 proliferation and cytokine production (11-14).

            "text": "Introduction exert their roles in regulating chromatin accessibility, mRNA stability and protein activity by 48 interacting with chromatin DNA, mRNAs or proteins (15-18). With the discovery and 49 characterization of an increasing number of lncRNAs, several mechanisms of these lncRNAs 50 in virus-host interactions have been elucidated (19) , however, many others remain 51 uncharacterized. 52 Influenza A virus (IAV) is a leading cause of respiratory-related morbidity and mortality, to the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines (31). However, little is known 73 about the roles of lncRNAs in IAV-infected patients or the mechanisms of lncRNA activity 74 and host antiviral immune responses. 75 In this study, we profile the lncRNAs of IAV-infected patient neutrophils and identify a 76 human lncRNA, designated AVAN, which plays a critical role in anti-IAV infection. 77 Functional experiments demonstrate that AVAN up-regulates FOXO3a expression to promote 78 neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment. In addition, AVAN enhances the activation of the 79 RIG-I-mediated antiviral response by directly binding to TRIM25. These results show that an 80 unannotated lncRNA, AVAN, functions to maintain innate immune homeostasis of antiviral 81 immunity during IAV infection. 82 LncRNA expression is regulated by the influenza A (H7N9) virus in human neutrophils. 84 Neutrophils, the prototypic cells of the innate immune system, are reported to play a 85 pivotal role in the innate immune response to IAV (21-23). To explore the roles of host 86 lncRNAs during IAV infection, we profiled whole transcriptional alterations using RNA-Seq 87 in neutrophil samples from patients infected with IAV in the acute stage and their matched 88 recovery-stage samples (GSE108807). We identified a total of 404 differentially expressed 89 protein-coding genes (FC>2, p<0.05), including 234 up-regulated and 170 down-regulated 90 genes, in each patient sample ( Fig S1) . The differentially expressed genes were strongly 91 associated with the immune response, inflammatory response and innate immune response 92 according to Gene ontology (GO) analysis ( Fig 1A) . We then mapped the detected lncRNAs 93 to the human genome (UCSC version hg19) and the NONCODE V3.0 database and found an 94 average of 240 up-regulated (range from 164 to 357) and 193 down-regulated (range from 95 158 to 257) novel lncRNAs in acute-stage influenza patients compared with their 96 recovery-stage counterparts (FC>2, p<0.05) and subjected them to a cluster analysis ( Fig 1B) . 97 To investigate the association between lncRNAs and IAV infection, in silico analysis 98 identified 26 novel lncRNAs candidates with notably aberrant expression (Fig 1C) . To 99 confirm the expression of these lncRNAs, we separated the neutrophils and monocytes from 100 healthy volunteers and infected the cells with IAV for 12 h and found that XLOC_040025 101 (AVAN) was most significantly up-regulated after IAV challenge (Fig 1D, E) . We also infected 102 human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with IAV and measured the expression of the 26 103 lncRNAs and found that AVAN was most strongly up-regulated after IAV infection (Fig 1F) . 106 We then performed qRT-PCR to quantify AVAN expression in the RNA-Seq samples and 107 found that the results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data ( Fig S2A) . Thus, AVAN was 108 chosen for subsequent investigation. To further confirm the expression of AVAN in 109 IAV-infected patients, we collected blood samples from 63 additional IAV-positive patients 110 and measured the expression of AVAN, which was significantly up-regulated in the neutrophils 111 of these patients (Fig 2A; Table S1 ). Similarly, AVAN was up-regulated in A549 cells after 112 infection with multiple sub-strains of IAV and several other viruses, including Sendai virus 113 (SeV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Fig 2B) . Moreover, AVAN expression was 114 significantly up-regulated upon IAV challenge in a time-and dose-dependent manner in A549 115 cells (Fig 2C, D) . Moreover, AVAN expression was also significantly up-regulated in a time- 116 and dose-dependent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60), which is 117 often a substitute for neutrophils, upon IAV challenge (Fig S2B, C) . Subcellular fractionation 118 followed by qRT-PCR in IAV-infected A549 cells revealed that the amount of AVAN localized 119 in the cytoplasm was nearly as same as the one in nucleus (Fig 2E, Fig S2D) . Besides, we 120 performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) with two specific probes in 121 IAV-uninfected and -infected A549 cells and found that AVAN localized in the cytoplasm and 122 nucleus were almost the same abundance ( Fig 2F) . In addition, we constructed competitive 123 association FISH to display the specific distribution of AVAN. When adding free 124 labeling-probes, the fluorescent dye from biotin labeling-probes was weaken (Fig S2E) . AVAN 125 exhibits no protein-coding potential according to ORF finder (32) and the coding potential calculator (33) (Fig S2F) . Only one transcript variant (approximately 500 nt) of AVAN was 127 found in A549 cells, and it was found to be up-regulated upon IAV infection using northern 128 blot analysis (Fig 2G) . The exact transcript length (517 nt) of AVAN was confirmed by 5' and 129 3' RACE (Table S2) , which revealed that AVAN is polyadenylated (Fig S2G) . Taken Table S3 -S8), suggesting that AVAN participates in innate antiviral immunity. To 140 identify the functions of AVAN, we generated AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells ( Fig 3A) and 141 found that viral replication was strongly inhibited (Fig 3B) . In contrast, virus titer was 142 up-regulated following AVAN knockdown with two specific siRNAs (Fig 3H, I IFN-\u03b2 transcript levels upon IAV infection compared with those of the control vector ( Fig 3C) . 150 To confirm this result, we performed ELISA to measure IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 protein expression 151 and found that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were strongly up-regulated in AVAN-overexpressing A549 152 cells during IAV infection ( Fig 3D) . Conversely, these phenomena were abolished by 153 knocking down AVAN (Fig 3J, K) . 154 The above GSEA data and GO analysis showed that the genes related to AVAN were also 155 significantly enriched in chemotaxis and immune cell activation ( Fig S4A, Table S9 , S10), the results from HL60 cells were consistent with those obtained in A549 cells (Fig S4D, F) . 174 Collectively, these data indicate that lncRNA-AVAN plays a vital role in antiviral responses by 175 positively regulating type I IFN induction and neutrophil chemotaxis. Table S11 ). Most of these divergent 182 genes were associated with antiviral innate immune responses and inflammatory diseases 183 according to Reactome pathway analysis ( Fig 4B) and FunDO diseases analysis ( Fig S5) . 184 Notably, genes associated with immune system IFN signaling and cytokine signaling were 185 markedly up-regulated in cells with ectopic AVAN expression compared with control cells, 186 including chemokines and ISGs (IFN stimulated genes) ( Fig 4C) . These significantly 187 up-regulated genes, including MX1, ISG15, IFIT2, OASL, IFIM3, TNFAIP3, CXCL2 and 188 CCL5, were confirmed by qRT-PCR ( Fig 4D) . These data again reveal that AVAN strongly 189 participates in antiviral innate immune processes and neutrophil chemotaxis. Previous experiments demonstrated that AVAN is located in the cytoplasm (Fig 2E, 2F ). 232 To investigate the molecular mechanism of AVAN in the cytoplasm, RNA pull-down assays 233 using biotin-labeled AVAN or AVAN antisense control followed by mass spectrometry (MS) 234 analysis were performed. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, an RNA-binding protein, was 235 found to bind AVAN in IAV-infected A549 cells compared with the AVAN antisense control Previous study showed that a stabilization of TRIM25-RIG-I interaction is important for a 257 sustained antiviral IFN response (48). We next examined the effect of AVAN on the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I. We found that ectopically expressing AVAN markedly enhanced 259 the association between TRIM25 and RIG-I upon IAV infection ( Fig 6H) . Additionally, 260 different fragments of AVAN were overexpressed in A549. We observed that P1(1-200nt) 261 could enhance the association between TRIM25 and RIG-I, as full-length AVAN, while 262 fragment P2+P3 (201-517nt) couldn't ( Fig S7B) . Moreover, endogenous or exogenous RIG-I 263 ubiquitylation was significantly increased in AVAN-overexpressing cells in the context of IAV 264 infection compared with the control vector (Fig 6I, J) . Furthermore, we explored the impact of 265 altered AVAN levels on RIG-I signaling. Total RIG-I protein levels did not differ significantly 266 between AVAN-overexpressing and control cells. However, AVAN overexpression increased 267 TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation upon IAV infection (Fig 6K, left) . In contrast, AVAN 268 knockdown abolished these changes (Fig 6K, right) . To test whether AVAN enhances the 279 To further investigate the in vivo effect of AVAN on IAV pathogenesis, we constructed an AVAN-containing AAV2/9 vector and a control vector, which were then delivered into 281 4-week-old C57L/B6 mice via intranasal (i.n.) administration. We found that AVAN was 282 ectopically expressed in the lung of AAV2/9-AVAN treated mice (Fig 7A) . Strikingly, after 283 BJ501 infection, the groups pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN exhibited significantly increased 284 survival rates and reduced body weight loss at 10 days post-infection compared with the 285 control group (Fig 7B, C) . Furthermore, lung edema, measured as the wet-to-dry ratio of 286 whole lung, was ameliorated (Fig 7D) , and improved lung histopathology was observed in 287 infected mice pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN (Fig 7E, F) . Moreover, the virus titer from the 288 lungs of infected mice was also significantly reduced in AAV2/9-AVAN-treated mice 289 compared with that in control mice (Fig 7G, H) . Although AVAN triggers FOXO3a expression 290 in the nucleus to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro, we did not observe that AVAN 291 promotes FOXO3a expression in vivo (data not shown). This finding may result from the low 292 conservation of AVAN between humans and mice. Consistent with the association in human, 293 we found that AVAN also bind to rodent Trim25 through RNA pull-down using mouse tissue 294 ( Fig 7I) . In addition, AAV2/9-AVAN promote type I IFN expression in vivo (Fig 7J) . Taken 295 together, these observations indicate that AVAN can ameliorate IAV-induced acute lung injury 296 in vivo and protect mice from IAV infection. (Fig 3) , speculated that lncRNA AVAN is critical in the IFN induction pathway. 368 To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first identification of lncRNA-AVAN as 369 a novel partner of TRIM25 and demonstrates that AVAN suppresses IAV replication via 370 TRIM25-RIG-I-dependent antiviral pathways. 371 In conclusion, we provide the first lncRNA landscape of IAV-infected patient neutrophils 372 and identify the function of AVAN, a novel lncRNA, in the innate antiviral immune response. 373 AVAN can enhance the chemotaxis of neutrophils by promoting FOXO3a expression in cis. 374 On the one hand, AVAN can serve as a positive regulator of RIG-I signaling by directly 375 binding TRIM25 and enhancing the association between TRIM25 and RIG-I in trans. (Fig 8) . The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. 456 The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk (BD) in 1\u00d7 Tris-buffered saline and 457 0.1% Triton 100 for 1 h while shaking at room temperature. Next, the membranes were 458 incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 459 antibodies. Bands were visualized using the Kodak film exposure detection system. The film 460 was scanned, and the band intensity was analyzed using Quantity One software.",

Neutrophils provide one of the early lines of innate 55 immunity and defense against invading microorganisms, which contribute to the fine 56 regulation of the inflammatory and antiviral immune responses (21-23). Increasing evidence 57 suggests that neutrophils are also prominent components of the inflammatory and immune 58 responses during virus infection. Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection during 59 the innate immune response to IAV (24-26). In addition, neutrophils can produce and release a 60 large variety of cytokines and chemokines (22), which enables them to significantly influence 61 antiviral defense (27). During virus infection, chemokines play a crucial role in neutrophil activation and chemotaxis (28). However, how lncRNA functions in this process -I-like receptors (RLRs), namely, RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, are 65 well-defined single-stranded viral RNA sensors that play a pivotal role in host antiviral 66 activity by initializing the rapid production of type I interferons (IFN) and cytokines (29). 67 RIG-I is a key sensor of paramyxoviruses, influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese 68 encephalitis virus (30). The binding of viral RNA to the RIG-I C-terminal regulatory domain 69 results in a conformational change that, in turn, enables RIG-I binding to the signal adaptor 70 MAVS (also called VISA, IPS-1, or CARDIF) through N-terminal caspase recruitment 71 domains (CARDs). Such binding enhances the phosphorylation of IRF3 and eventually leads 72",

These phenomena were disrupted by 160 knocking down AVAN (Fig 3L). The chemokines interleukin-8 (CXCL8, IL-8) is potent 161 neutrophil chemoattractant (37) and is released by a variety of lung cells, including 162 macrophages and epithelial cells as well as neutrophils themselves (38). IL-8 primarily 163 attracts neutrophils and induces them to release lysosomal enzymes, triggering the respiratory 164 burst and increasing the expression of adhesion molecules on the cell surface (39). IL-8 is the 165 primary cytokine involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of damage or infection 166 and plays a crucial role in acute inflammation by recruiting and mediating neutrophils and 167 other cells (40). Thus, we determine whether AVAN altered IL-8 expression in A549 cells. 168 AVAN overexpression increased IL-8 transcript and protein levels upon IAV infection 169 compared with those of the control vector(Fig 3F, G); this was abolished upon AVAN knockdown(Fig 3M, N). To verify our hypothesis, we next overexpressed or knocked down 171 AVAN in HL60 cells(Fig S4C, E)and infected them with IAV. The cell samples were 172 harvested at the indicated times, and transcript and protein levels of IL-8 were measured. The 173",

Interestingly, mRNA array data revealed that FOXO3a is 196 significantly up-regulated following AVAN overexpression during IAV infection(Fig 4C). To197 investigate the role of AVAN in FOXO3a expression, we measured the abundances of 198 FOXO3a after overexpressing or knocking down AVAN in A549 and HL60 cell lines. The 199 overexpression of AVAN up-regulated FOXO3a transcription in A549 cells, consistent with its 200 role in enhancing FOXO3a protein expression (Fig 5A; Fig S6A left). Conversely, knocking 201 down AVAN down-regulated FOXO3a transcription and protein expression (Fig 5B; Fig S6A 202 right). In addition, the results in HL60 were consistent with these observed in A549 cells of AVAN with FOXO3a expression and the subcellular localization of 205 AVAN in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig 2E, F) prompted us to test whether AVAN 206 interacts with the FOXO3a promoter. To this end, we conducted chromatin isolation by RNA 207 purification (ChIRP) using antisense oligoes against AVAN followed by qPCR in BJ501 208 -uninfected and -infected A549 cells and found that AVAN bound to sequences upstream of 209 FOXO3a (Fig 5C, D, E). We further verified the potential role of AVAN in modulating 210 chromatin modifications at the FOXO3a promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 211 (ChIP)-qPCR revealed that ectopic AVAN expression increased Pol II binding, as well as 212 H3K4me3 and H3K27ac levels, at the AVAN-coated FOXO3a promoter in virus infected A549 213 cell(Fig 5F, G, H)and uninfected A549 cell(Fig S6D, E, F).

Besides, ChIRP followed by western blot revealed that AVAN-specific probes could pull 238 down TRIM25 while LacZ couldn't (Fig 6C). To validate the interaction between AVAN and 239 TRIM25, we immunoprecipitated TRIM25 from IAV-infected A549 cells and quantified the240 protein-bound AVAN. Significantly higher levels of AVAN were detected with exogenous containing the SPRY domain, B box/central coiled-coil domain (CCD), or 244 RING domain and performed AVAN RNA pull-down western blot experiments. The results 245 showed that only the B box/central CCD domain was involved in the AVAN-TRIM25 246 association (Fig 6F). Furthermore, to explore the TRIM25 binding site on AVAN RNA, three 247 truncated probes from AVAN were used for RNA pull-down assay. The result indicated that 248 the TRIM25-binding activity mapped between nucleotides 1 and 200 (Fig 6G). Together, 249 these findings indicate that AVAN physically interacts with TRIM25 and that the B box/central 250 CCD of TRIM25 and 1-200nt of AVAN contribute to this association. 251 To test whether AVAN enhances the IFN-mediated antiviral innate immune response 252 through TRIM25 and RIG-I signaling, we knocked down endogenous TRIM25 in HEK-293T 253 cells and observed a markedly reduced effect of ectopic AVAN expression on the activation of 254 IFNB1-responsive reporters in the context of IAV infection (Fig S7A).

            "text": "and lncRNAs are an emerging paradigm in the regulation of innate immune 301 responses. Previous studies have described several lncRNAs that are differentially expressed 302 during viral infection, including in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 303 (SARS-CoV)-infected mice, IAV-infected human lung cells and enterovirus 71 304 (EV71)-infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (49-51). However, little is known about the 305 lncRNA profile of influenza patients. In this study, we profiled the transcriptome of 306 neutrophils isolated from IAV-infected patients via RNA-Seq technology for the first time. 307 Through a comprehensive analysis of these data, we identified 404 differentially expressed 308 mRNAs and 433 differentially expressed noncoding RNAs in neutrophils of influenza patients. 309 Among these highly expressed genes, we found an lncRNA named AVAN that plays a pivotal 310 role in antiviral responses. 311 Several studies have shown that differentially expressed lncRNAs function as negative or 312 positive regulators in various critical steps of the antiviral response (52). For example, BISPR 313 lncRNA can regulate the antiviral IFN response through the induction of the expression of the 314 genomically neighboring gene BST2 in cis. Another IAV-associated intronic antisense 315 lncRNA, negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV), modulates antiviral responses by 316 suppressing ISG transcription via altered histone modifications (53). A recent study show that 317 lnc-Lsm3b can compete with viral RNAs in the binding of RIG-I monomers and involve in 318 RIG-I-mediated antiviral response (54). In contrast, Herein, our data displayed that AVAN acts 319 as a positive regulator in the antivirus response through two different mechanisms. In one hand, cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds TRIM25 and enhances the association of 321 TRIM25 and RIG-I and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby promoting TRIM25-and 322 RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. In the other hand, nuclear lncRNA-AVAN 323 positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) in cis by associating 324 with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis. 325 FOXO3a is a member of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors, 326 which is a PTEN/PI3K/AKT effector functioning in diverse cellular activities such as the 327 induction of cell-cycle arrest, stress resistance, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism 328 (55-57). FOXO3a reportedly functions as a major transcriptional regulator in the maintenance 329 of neutrophil activation during inflammation (58). However, little is known about the function 330 of FOXO3a during the immune response in epithelial cells. Previous research demonstrated 331 that FOXO3a repressed cytokine expression induced by LPS or bacteria (46). In this study, 332 FOXO3a plays a different function during IAV infection. FOXO3a promotes IL-8 expression 333 in IAV-infected A549 cells, which additionally enhances neutrophil chemotaxis. AVAN is 334 located 1449-bp upstream of FOXO3a. We found that lncRNA-AVAN can markedly increase 335 FOXO3a expression through chromatin remodeling in A549 cells. Additionally, AVAN can 336 enhance neutrophil chemotaxis by upregulating the expression of IL-8. However, knockdown 337 FOXO3a blocked the upregulation of IL-8 by AVAN. In the other hand, to confirm how much 338 of the rise in the level of FOXO3a after AVAN overexpression is the result of enhanced IFN 339 response, as opposed to a direct impact by AVAN on FOXO3a locus, we also used HL60 cells 340 to evade IFN effects (data not shown here). Meanwhile, as seen in Figure 5, our data showed 341 that there is a direct effect of AVAN on FOXO3a promoter and thereby enhanced Pol II binding and H3K4me3 and H3K27ac accumulation. Of course, we would generate a mutant 343 AVAN that can induce IFN response similar to WT AVAN but can't bind the FOXO3a 344 promoter or change its expression level in subsequently studies. In addition, our results 345 exhibited that neutrophils were isolated from fresh peripheral blood and were infected in vitro 346 with influenza virus does not mimic their actual status in vivo. How and where AVAN is 347 induced in neutrophils need to be further investigated. Thus, we propose that AVAN may 348 enhance neutrophil chemotaxis through the regulation of FOXO3a expression. -inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) play a well-known role in 352 RNA virus recognition (59). Previous reports have shown that RIG-I is the main host sensor 353 involved in recognizing cytoplasmic viral RNA and subsequently initiating immune responses 354 to eliminate infection. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is critically important in the RIG-I 355 signaling pathway. TRIM25 interacts with the CARD1 region of RIG-I and enhances RIG-I 356 polyubiquitylation to initiate RIG-I-mediated antivirus responses (47). A previous study found 357 that viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the host immune response 358 through regulating the role of TRIM25. IAV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) specifically 359 inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, thereby suppressing the RIG-I 360 signaling pathway (60). Our results demonstrated that the host can also regulate TRIM25 to 361 increase the immune response. AVAN can directly bind with the B box/central CCD of 362 TRIM25 in A549 cells. Furthermore, the interaction of AVAN with TRIM25 promotes the 363 association between TRIM25 and RIG-I and enhances RIG-I ubiquitylation, thereby promoting IFN expression. It is worth noting that AVAN binds TRIM25 and facilitates IFN 365 expression in mice. In addition, we explored the impact of AVAN overexpression or 366 knockdown in IFN induction, chemo attraction of neutrophils or expression of cytokines and 367 chemokines",
