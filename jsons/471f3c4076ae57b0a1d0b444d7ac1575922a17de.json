The viral protein 7 (VP7) and non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) genes of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] were closely related to cogent genes of human RVAs, suggesting that a reassortment between pig and human strains had occurred. Recombination analysis showed that RVA/Pig/ China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] is a natural recombinant strain between the P[23] and P[7] RVA strains, and crossover points for recombination were found at nucleotides (nt) 456 and 804 of the VP4 gene.

The samples were positive for PoRV but negative for TGEV and PEDV (Figure S1). The complete open reading frame (ORF) sequences for all 11 genome segments of strain RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P [13] were obtained using the primers as shown in Table S1. The accession numbers for the 11 segments deposited in GenBank are MF462321, MF462322, MF462323, MF462324, MF462325, MF462326, MF462316, MF462317, MF462318, MF462319 and MF462320 for VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7, NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP5, respectively.

The results show that two aa positions (434E and 441R) in the neutralizing epitope in VP5* were conserved (Figure 3b). Five aa (306, 393, 394, 398 and 459) in the VP5* neutralizing epitope differed between RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] and the RCE strain OSU-G5P[7]-USA (Figure 3b).

No other Chinese strains were previously reported to contain six additional nt in the VP8* protein (Figure 4a). However, the presence of six-nt gains at the same positions was found in strains from other countries, including Thailand, India, Japan, Australia, and the USA (Figure 4a). The additional six nt resulted in four aa changes (aa 184, 185, 186 and 190) and the loss of two aa from the VP8* protein (aa 188 and 189) (Figure 4a). Further analysis of the influence of these aa changes on the spatial structure of the VP8* protein was performed. The VP8* protein sequences (70-210 aa) of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] and RVA/Pig/ China/NMTL were searched against the SWISS-MODEL template library. For the best homology modelling with VP8* protein sequences (70-210 aa) of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] while searching against templates, the solution structure of the rotavirus spike protein (SMTL id 2p3j.1) (Kraschnefski et al., 2009) was selected for model construction. Based on the results, the spatial structure of the VP8* protein of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] was different from that of RVA/Pig/China/NMTL. The RVA/Pig/China/NMTL strain forms a longer b-sheet in the aa region of 184TTGY187 than in the aa region of 184APQEFG190 in RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] (Figure 4b).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "gene of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] was RVA/Pig/ PRG9121/2006/G9P[7] (JF796737) (Kim et al., 2012), and the minor parental strain was RVA/Pig-wt/BEL/12R046/2012/G9P[23] (KM820720) (Theuns et al., 2015) (Figure 4b). These results indicate that P[13] of RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] was the result of recombination of P[23] and P[7] RVA genes. 4 | DISCUSSION Many types of viruses cause diarrhoea in animals, including TGEV (Zhang, Zhu, Zhu, Chen et al., 2017), swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs) (Belsham et al., 2016), PEDV (Lohse et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2014; Zhang, Tian et al., 2017), porcine deltacoronavirus (Lee et al., 2016; Mai et al., 2017; Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017) and rotaviruses (Kim et al., 2016). Rotaviruses cause acute dehydrating diarrhoea in various hosts, including children and young animals (Jiang, Liu, & Tan, 2017). Further information on rotavirus diversity is necessary to improve our understanding of the biological characteristics and evolution of rotaviruses.

Of the 11 segments of the RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] strain, nine gene segments (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6, NSP1, NSP2, NSP3 and NPS5) possessed sequences nearly identical with those of the porcine strains, suggesting that RVA/Pig/China/LNCY/2016/G3P[13] was possibly of porcine origin. However, the VP7 and NSP4 genes of this porcine strain had human origins because the VP7 and NSP4 genes had the closest relationships with G3-RVA/Human-tc/USA/P/ 1974/G3[P8] and E1-RVA/Human-tc/USA/P/1974/G3[P8], respectively.

In developing countries, animal husbandry (i.e., cattle, sheep and pigs) is closely related to human populations, which provides potential possibilities for reassortment and recombination events. Monitoring newly emerging RVs in animals is important for the control of RVs infection in both humans and animals. The exact mechanism of recombination in rotaviruses is still unclear. Hypotheses have suggested that there may be a direct link between recombination and the formation of the secondary RNA structure, because these RNA structures induce stops, stalls or delays that favour strand invasion (Perez-Losada, Arenas, Galan, Palero, & Gonzalez-Candelas, 2015).
