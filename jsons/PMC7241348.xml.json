To illustrate one such pathway, trace the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide as codified by the sensing apparatus in the carotid bodies, and transmitted via the nerves of Hering (small branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve), to the solitary tract and nucleus localized to the caudal medullary tegementum. The integrity of the complex connectivity of this circuitry must be maintained in order to achieve its goal of regulating all functions of the respiratory system to maintain oxygen saturation and delivery to ensure continuous organ tissue viability.",

The successful rescue intervention reported utilized the application of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (HDMTX-LR), an intensive and highly pleiotropic anti-inflammatory strategy [1]. Since then, we have treated a broadening diversity of other causes that we believe to be variants of \u2018PANIC\u2019, including other post-infectious encephalomyelitides (e.g. post-adenovirus) [Fig. 1\n] and post-vaccinal (e.g. post-dTap) encephalomyelitides [Fig. 2\n].

Each individual alveolar membrane is 1-cell-thick and necessitates an intimate and tight juxtaposition of the alveolar epithelium with that of the pulmonary capillary endothelium, also with the thickness of a single cell. The single-cell arrangement, and ultra-tight juxtaposition of the capillary anatomy with that of the alveolar epithelium, constitutes an ideal architecture for the principal goal of pulmonary physiology, the loading of oxygen onto red cell hemoglobin and the expulsion of CO2 from the lungs into the ambient air [Fig. 3].",

A further challenge relates to the limited window of opportunity to therapeutically intervene before the obliteration of a corpus of alveoli, from which survival is no longer feasible. Many who have succumbed to COVID-19, have done so while being carefully managed on pressure ventilation, with adequate respiratory rate (whether patient or ventilator triggered), and continuous delivery of oxygen, commensurate with optimization and persistency of 02 saturation kinetics. The addition of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ensures that the bronchopulmonary terminus remains patent to facilitate effective gas diffusion. Another dividend of pressure ventilation is that it contributes to the process of effective pulmonary toilet, now referred to as Pulmonary Hygiene, and involves the use of medications, devices, and/or maneuvers, which are principally aimed at optimizing mucus clearance mechanisms [40].",

Destruction of alveolar cells expressing ACE-2r by SARS-CoV-2 could theoretically be orchestrated by post-viral replication cell bursting, or by antigen-antibody complex triggering antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via activation of the complement pathway [48,49]. Activation of the complement pathway would result in the C3a and C5a fragments acting as anaphylatoxins and chemotaxins, serving to recruit neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils into the target tissue. Upon arrival, these cells would release their immune effector mediators, including free radicals and reactive oxygen species (such as superoxide). Alternatively, distal activation of the complement pathways involving C5 convertase leads to the assembly of the C5b-C8 coordinated membrane attack complex (MAC) and the subsequent traversal of C9 into the MAC channel and across the cell membrane (i.e. the alveolar epithelium), leading to osmotic derangements culminating in cell death [Fig. 3]. In order to ascertain the role played by the complement system in the pathobiology of COVID-19, a recently reported case series characterized the recovery of four ICU patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia or ARDS, in response to eculizumab, an antibody against C5 convertase, which ultimately prevents the assembly of MAC, and thereby ADCC [50].",

An alternative explanation is that the lymphopenia may be due to a cortisol burst from stress [https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.98.15.15.1587/c]. The sequestration of lymphocytes into the lungs may also be a feasible hypothesis for the circulating lymphopenia (let's recall that only 3\u20135% of the body's mononuclear cells are in circulation at any given time). Despite the lymphopenia, widespread lymphocyte activation is a stereotypic observation in those with the disorder, particularly associated with the severe variant [64,65].",

            "text": "Fig. 3: Here we present the principal target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the most distal extent of the bronchopulmonary tree; the alveoli and its complex architecture and tight juxtaposition with respect to the capillary terminals of the most distal pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins. A) We present the component parts of the SARS-CoV-2 agent. Note that the virion has a nucleocapsid composed of a positive single strand RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, which is then enclosed within a sphere delimited by membrane bilayers of phospholipid. Projecting out of the virion is the spike protein; the most important component part, given that the SARS-CoV-2 tropism is contingent upon the binding of spike to its counter-receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE-2r). B) Demonstrates a pull-out in order to reveal the normal grape-like cluster arrangement of lung alveoli (on the left), in contrast to C) the irregular \u2018deflated\u2019 appearance of this terminal anatomic specialization that serves to uniquely package the sheer enormity of required surface area (~70 m2) in order to provide a gas-exchange apparatus sufficient to meet the body's demand for a continuous and uninterrupted supply of oxygen, while also serving as a portal for the expulsion of \u2018bioenergetic exhaust\u2019, in the form of carbon dioxide. D) represents the indivisible functional unit for gas-exchange, comprised of a single cell thick lining of which is comprised of a single cell thickness of epithelium. However, an added level of complexity relates to the differentiation of the cellular subtypes of the alveolar epithelial cells with the type I pneumocyte representing the principal cell responsible for gas exchange; the type II pneumocyte secretes surfactant, crucial for reducing alveolar surface tension which prevents alveolar collapse; and the type III pneumocyte or alveolar macrophage (aka \u2018dust cells\u2019) which are mobile and serve as a kind of \u2018vacuum cleaner\u2019 capable of removing a wide diversity of contaminants and microbial elements in order to minimize interference \u2018clean\u2019 gas-exchange. Inside the alveolus we illustrate the aerosolized entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and some of the immune elements which have trafficked to this site, secondary to immune network activation by the virus. This includes the accumulation of macrophages, mast cells, polymophonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), along with the cellular release of each cell's effector elements, such as cytokines, chemokines, free radicals, and reactive oxygen species. On the outer circular perimeter of the figure, we have magnified the circumferential organization of the alveolar epithelium in order to illustrate the distinctive mechanisms which collectively represent the SARS-CoV-2 triggered \u2018prolific activation of a network immune-mediated, inflammatory crisis (\u2018PANIC\u2019). E) We illustrate the sentinel step in viral tropism, vis a vis binding of the spike protein on the virion surface to the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptor (ACE-2r) on the surface of the alveolar epithelium. Subsequent to this binding interaction is the entry of the virus into the epithelium via the endosomal pathway, culminating in the release of viral RNA in preparation for replication and eventual release of new virions, thereby perpetuating an amplification of the viral lifecycle and the corresponding acceleration in the destruction of lung alveoli, until a threshold burden of disease is established, beyond which the body's continuous demand for oxygen can no longer be achieved, at which point bioenergetic collapse occurs and heralds in the rapid demise and ultimately death of the patient. F) A distinctive facet of the PANIC Attack is illustrated where an activated immune cell has entered a terminal phase, programmed cell death or apoptosis. An inflammatory form of this cell-death sequence involves the massive release of cytokines and chemokines at the termination of the cell's viability, and is referred to as pyroptosis. G) We illustrate adaptive immune mechanisms triggered by the virus, and which sets into motion the development of both humoral (antibody generation), as well as cellular (with phenotypes determined by the preferential synthesis and release of cytokine and chemokine elements, which we can dichotomize into a categorical scheme of pro-inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory or immunoregulatory profiles) immune activities. Such processes commence with the organization of the immunologic \u2018synapse\u2019, which includes processed antigen (e.g. viral epitope; such as the SARS-CoV-2 peptide) coupled to major histocompatibility complex II proteins in an antigen presenting cell (such as a macrophage, dendritic cell, or B cell), then shuttled to the cell surface where this complex interacts with a T cell receptor; and the subsequent activation of response priming mechanisms. Priming can result in T cell mediated activities, principally via cytokine and chemokine networks, whereas humoral or B cell networks involve a complex array of activities which commence with somatic hypermutations within the immunoglobulin gene complex, which promotes the development of affinity (a means by which an antibody can bind to its cognate antigen) and avidity (a measure of the binding strength between an antibody and the antigen) maturation, followed by class switching from the acute IgM subtype to the convalescent and memory IgG phenotype. H) We illustrate alveolar epithelial membrane, albeit with a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 membrane integrated at the cell surface in what is referred to as syncytia (a kind of chimeric fusion of membranes). In this case, we can observe that the integrated or syncytial membrane expresses spike protein. However, rather than interacting with the ACE-2r, the PANIC Attack process has generated antibodies which bind to spike protein giving rise to either macrophage Fc receptor binding to the Fc portion of the anti-spike antibody and clearance via the reticuloendothelial system (RES), or activation of the complement fixation site on the anti-spike antibody which sets into motion a series of immune activities, which can foment further damage to the alveolar gas exchange apparatus. Activation of the lectin complement pathway, the alternative pathway (via contact with surfaces, including dead cellular debris), and the classical complement pathway all converge to activate a series of serine esterases, leading to the liberation of C3a and C5a, which serve as anaphylatoxins and chemotaxins promoting innate immune activities such as the migration of cellular elements (e.g. neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) into the alveoli, whereupon their arrival, their effector species (super oxides, free radicals, histamine, etc) can be released and damage the delicate architecture of the gas exchange apparatus. I) We illustrate how the complement system activities also involve the coordination between C5b-C8 in the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which contains a central channel, whereby C9 traverses the MAC and perforates the epithelial cell membrane culminating in death and ultimately exfoliation; a cataclysmic step in the destruction of the integrity of the alveoli, and failure of localized gas exchange.",
