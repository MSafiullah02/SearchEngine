We release publications as soon as they are in print format and well before they are assigned to an issue, but it takes time to get materials through the process of typesetting. We have been able to expedite this to 10 days at best, but the more that comes to us that is urgent, the longer it will take on average. We are also mindful that all of our author\u2019s work should be published as soon as possible, and with finite resources, there are potential downstream consequences if we expedite too much COVID-19 material.",

This is particularly problematic for manuscripts describing natural history, specific clinical syndromes, and treatment of COVID-19 which are often superseded in days. We accepted a review of a clinical case series early on, but are unlikely to do so again at least in this time of rapidly rising cases in the USA and around the world.",

JGIM\u2019s transition to Editorial Manager has allowed editors to keep abreast of peer review invitations and opinions in real time, but we cannot always expect reviewers to drop everything at this busy time to complete reviews quickly for us. The experts that we would most particularly rely upon for COVID-19 papers are the same people who are in the trenches developing policies, conducting research, shaping the educational mission, and delivering clinical care. We worry that they do not have time to eat or sleep\u2014never mind thoughtfully critique a manuscript. Your editors-in-chief have provided rapid group peer review for some manuscripts for this and other urgent topics. While we can certainly edit for clarity, language, and methods, many COVID-19 submissions will test our expertise.",

We welcome pieces that are not dependent on the changing numbers and in particular manuscripts that set the stage for how we will continue to think about the dilemmas that we will face in the years to come. We have expedited this \u201cFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk\u201d even though it will not necessarily refer to articles in the same printed issue as has been our habit.

Our team has had some spirited conversations on decisions to publish material that has appeared in other places. We published one paper1 that referred to another paper in an economics journal ultimately doing so because our readership would otherwise be unlikely to ever hear of this important manuscript. We have rarely published pieces that relate to AHRQ monographs,2 because the monographs reached a limited audience. Similarly, we have considered papers on materials that are behind the VA firewall and inaccessible to readers who do not work in the VA. For COVID-19 papers, we have considered the question of whether we should publish material that has also been in the lay press. The value of publications in the lay press that exhort governmental action is obvious. The argument has been made that secondary (and most often later) publication in JGIM will give durability through PubMed indexing and the ability to reference these publications in the coming year.",

While not mentioned in ICMJE guidance, duplicate publication is also misleading in assessing promotion metrics in the overweighting of a body of work. ICMJE does have a proviso for public emergencies, stating that \u201c\u2026information with immediate implications for public health should be disseminated without concern that this will preclude subsequent consideration for publication in a journal.\u201d Therefore, while we recognize the risk that COVID-19-themed publications may put forward ideas that have already been disseminated in other settings, we are willing to take this risk and welcome submissions that may fall into that category.",
