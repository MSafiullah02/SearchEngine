            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory infections resulting in hospital admission and death among children <5 years worldwide [1]. The estimated global mortality due to RSV infection in 2005 was 66,000\u201399,000 deaths in children <5 years of age with 99% of those deaths in developing countries [2]. Infants born prematurely and those with chronic lung or cardiac disease are at increased risk for severe disease from RSV infection. Palivizumab (PZ; brand name Synagis\u00ae, MedImmune Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), is a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that neutralizes RSV by inhibiting viral fusion through interaction with a site spanning residues 262\u2013276 of the RSV fusion glycoprotein (F) [3], [4], [5]. PZ is the only prophylaxis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration against RSV infection. [6], [7]. Five monthly PZ injections spanning the annual RSV epidemic period have been shown to reduce hospitalizations among high-risk children in the US [6]. However, the high mutation rates found with RNA viruses allow their ready escape from immune pressure [8]. Antibody selection of PZ-resistant RSV strains in cell culture and animal systems have been well described, including mutant selection by the murine parent of PZ [5], [9], [10], [11]. Increasing use of PZ in high-risk children and immunocompromised persons might provide opportunities for PZ resistant mutants to arise with the potential for sustained transmission to others. Previous reports have shown that mutations leading to amino acid substitutions in the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein, including S268I, K272Q, K272E, K272M, S275E, S275L and N276S, have been associated with breakthrough infections in patients receiving PZ prophylaxis [11], [12], [13], [14]. The extent to which these mutations occur is not well known.",

[16]. Positive samples were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing of the F gene region encoding the PZ binding site using the following primer sets (forward primers were 5\u2032-biotinylated to facilitate pyrosequecing): RSV A, fwd 5\u2032-TAACTACACCTGTAAGCAC -3\u2032 and rev 5\u2032-ACATGATAGAGTAACTTTGC -3\u2032; RSV B, fwd 5\u2032-AGCACTTACATGTTAACAAAC-3\u2032 and rev 5\u2032-TGATAGAATAACTTTGTTGCC- 3\u2032). RT-PCR amplification was performed using the SuperScript III One-step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and the amplicons (RSV A, 140 bp; RSV B, 123 bp) were purified using exoSAP-IT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Two sequencing procedures were applied: Sanger sequencing on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and pyrosequencing on a PyroMark Q24 instrument (Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a procedure newly developed for this study (available on request). For Sanger sequencing, amplicons were subjected to forward and reverse cycle sequencing using the BigDye terminator sequencing kit v.1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Semi-quantitative pyrosequencing was performed targeting 4 designated mutation sites known to alter PZ susceptibility (codons: 268, 272, 275, 276) and analyses were performed with PyroMark Q24 Analysis Software using the allele quantification frequency mode. For each allele tested, a calibration curve was generated from standards prepared with the following proportions of the wild-type (WT)/mutant (M) allele 0/100%, 5/95%, 10/90%, 25/75% and 50/50%. Calibration standards were included in each run and performed in triplicate at each dilution. The limit of detection for each M allele was estimated by measuring the signal obtained from 20 known negative respiratory swab samples (100% WT) and calculating the positive response cut-off (WT46\u201354%/M50% and WT\u226412%/M100%). To exclude other possible viral etiologies, specimens identified with RSV PZ resistance strains were also tested by a panel of CDC in house RT-PCR assays for influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronaviruses.",

Archived specimens were available from 45 of the 56 RSV-positive children and were sent to CDC for confirmatory testing and sequencing. Of these, 39 were confirmed positive for RSV by rRT-PCR; the remaining 6 specimens were negative at CDC for RSV by both rRT-PCR and RT-PCR assays. Molecular typing identified 42 partial F gene sequences in the 39 specimens: 19 single RSV subgroup A; 17 single RSV subgroup B; 1 co-detection of single RSV A and B; and 2 co-detections of 2 different RSV B sequences. RSV A and B strains co-circulated during most years and alternated in predominance over the study period (Table 1).",

The N276S mutation was originally described in a patient with an RSV A breakthrough infection and was shown to exhibit increased PZ resistance by in vitro based microneutralization assay [12]. However, more recent reports have shown RSV A N276S to be naturally occurring and efforts to confirm PZ resistance by microneutralization assay have failed [13], [17]. It is interesting to note that S276 is the consensus sequence of RSV B viruses and that 5 of the 7 breakthrough strains we identified were RSV subgroup B, all possessing S276, suggesting that these B strains may be inherently more resistant to PZ whose murine parent was developed to RSV strain A2. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that coincident mutations outside of the PZ binding region may have contributed to PZ resistance or that these infections simply occurred for other reasons as noted above.",
