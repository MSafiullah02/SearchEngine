The armed forces and the civilians are under constant threat from a variety of microorganisms that can be used as weapons of mass destruction (Christophe et al., 1997). Advanced biological warfare agents will pose the greatest challenge to the development of appropriate medical countermeasures. Meeting this challenge will require an effective biodefense strategy in terms of a robust biodefense program that delivers the diagnostic technologies, medicines, and vaccines needed to counter the range of advanced bioweapons of the 21st century.",

            "text": "Biological weapons are characterized by low visibility, high potency, substantial accessibility, and relatively easy delivery (Klietmann and Ruoff, 2001). Bioterrorism is the intentional use of microorganisms\u2014bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins\u2014to produce disease and death in humans, livestock, and/or crops (Eneh, 2012). The bio agents could be carried by winds, insects, or birds, none of which respect national borders. It thus becomes very difficult to detect the biological agent or to determine whether the victim has been deliberately infected (Noah et al., 2002; Riedel, 2004). The potential spectrum of bioterrorism ranges from hoaxes and use of non-mass casualty agents by individuals or small groups to state-sponsored terrorism that employs classic biological warfare (BW) agents and can produce large-scale outbreaks and mass casualties (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999). Such scenarios would present serious challenges for patient treatment and for prophylaxis of exposed persons. Further, environmental contamination could pose continuing threats. Harmfulness or hazardous (threat) of biological agents like Nipah, Ebola, Anthrax, Plague, etc., has increased significantly with the involvement of non-state actors who would exploit not only for mass casualties, but also for a variety of other purposes from the strategic to the tactical, leading to huge economic loss and general social disruption (Szinicz, 2005; Eitzen, 2001). Public awareness of the growing threat of bioterrorism is gaining momentum all over the world. Thus there is an increased demand for overall preparedness to address the challenges pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of new and re-emerging maliciously incited infectious diseases (Snowden, 2008; Grundmann, 2014). Anti-bioterrorism measures depend on the rapid biomonitoring of the situation as a part of pre-warning for immediate implementation of proper control measures (Parnell et al., 2010).",

Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) are easy to perform and fast, but they are not too sensitive and give more false-positive results.

A second layer, or sub-membrane, inhibits the immediate back-flow of fluids, which can obscure results. These tests can be used to detect both antibodies and antigens. To detect antibodies and antigens, the corresponding analyte is bound or immobilized as a dot or line on the membrane. This reagent \u201ccaptures\u201d the analyte as it flows through the membrane. To perform the test, a sample is applied to the membrane and allowed to wick through by capillary action. Thereafter, sequentially, there is a wash step, addition of the signal reagent, and a second wash to clear the membrane. Recent flow-through tests have successfully used colored latex particles or colloidal gold. This is a very rapid test procedure (3\u20135 \n min). However, these are not \u201cwalk-away\u201d tests as the lateral-flow test is.

The major advantage of the nucleic acid-based system is its specificity due to the uniqueness of genome in living systems. The careful designing of primer and probes enables specific detection of organisms. It also offers the highest sensitivity due to exponential amplification of the genomic signature. During PCR, a short piece of genome (DNA/RNA) of the biothreat agent is amplified, resulting in millions of copies of DNA within a short time (Towner et al., 2004; Mourya et al., 2012). A number of commercial versions of PCR systems are now available which consist of a disposable assay cartridge containing consumable reagents, an instrument that integrates the thermal components required for gene amplification, and the optical components required to quantify the amplified products (generally tagged with a fluorescent dye). Further, positive and negative controls are included as part of the assay to rule out reaction failure and validate both the assay and instrument performance. Sample preparation remains one of the important critical areas for the realization of on-site nucleic acid amplification systems. The results of PCR vary widely depending on the presence of inhibitors in the sample and are more crucial from complex environmental matrices, which require sample processing. Different modifications to the conventional PCR have been made that enable the simultaneous detection of multiple threat agents. The multiplex PCR substantially reduces cost and time (Nazarenko et al., 2002). The general contamination of source DNA in toxin samples is now exploited to identify the toxins.",

RT-PCR measures changes in fluorescence intensity which is proportional to the increase of the amplicon. RT-PCR are primarily of two types: specific and non-specific. In non-specific RT-PCR, a universal DNA interacting dye like SYBR Green is used that emits fluorescence when bound to DNA. Further, a melting curve analysis is performed following amplification that provides specificity based on the length and composition of amplicon. This format is simpler to perform and inexpensive due to requirement of only primers. The specific detection relies on the use of unique target genome-specific fluorogenic labeled probes. The increase in fluorescence indicates the hybridization of probes to the target DNA, leading to physical separation of the fluorophore from the quencher (Liu et al., 2012). In contrast to non-specific SYBR Green format, probe-based assays provide multiplex capability through use of different fluorescent dyes. TaqMan Probes have been successfully employed for detection of multiple biothreat agents including Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Coxiella burneti, Cat A biothreat viral agents including smallpox, Ebola, and other hemorrhagic viruses (Buzard et al., 2012).",

            "text": "In contrast to RT-PCR, isothermal assays provide the advantage of a fast turnaround time. Isothermal loop-amplification (LAMP) is a novel powerful gene amplification technique that is widely adapted to early detection and identification of numerous microbial agents including biothreat pathogens. The isothermal nature makes this assay simple and rapid, and the whole amplification process can be completed within 1 h. It employs a set of six specially designed primers spanning eight distinct sequences of a target gene, making the assay extremely specific. The gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real-time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. This assay is amenable to field application, as the amplified product can be visualized by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a color change when a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye like SYBR Green I (Parida et al., 2011; Kurosaki et al., 2007).",
