Unequal safety-nets for private health insurance in the United States Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ABSTRACT Health insurance coverage for working-age adults in the United States is still predominantly determined by their jobs or their spouse's jobs. This article revealed that SES disparities in access to a spouse's coverage as a safety-net significantly contributed to the inequities in coverage loss during economic instability. Using the longitudinal Survey of Income and Program Participation (1996-2012), this article examines insurance transitions between socioeconomic groups during the two most recent recessions in the United States. The SES disparity in private coverage spiked during periods of high job-loss. Higher SES men's and women's coverages were barely affected as they became insured by their spouses even as they lost their own. Wives' insurance plans played a large role in mitigating declines in higher SES men's coverages during the 2008 recession.",

On the other hand, jobs available to people with less education shifted from industries with high offer-rates of employment-based coverage (i.e., manufacturing) to industries with low offer-rates (i.e., service sector) (Holahan & Cook, 2008) . These jobs were more susceptible to economic downturns, and more low SES people lost their insurance coverage during 2001 and 2008 recessions (DeNavas-Walt et al., 2013; Farber, 2015; Farber & Levy, 2000; Holahan, 2011) . The recessions amplified health coverage inequalities between education groups (Grusky, Western, & Wimer, 2011; Reschovsky et al., 2006) .",

Being married enabled access to their spouses' employment-based insurance plans, and many rely on their spouses' plan when they lose their own job-based coverage (Abraham & Royalty, 2005; Montez, Angel, & Angel, 2009; Short, 1998; Vistnes & Monheit, 2011) . The strong correlation between a person and their spouse's educational attainment (Schwartz & Mare, 2005) suggest that high SES people are more likely to have high SES spouses with jobs that also offer health insurance. If a one lost their job and insurance during a recession, presumably, they could have maintained coverage by switching over to their spouse's plan. This alternative safety-net may not have been as readily available for people with low SES.",

Waves 11 and 12 from the 1996 panel In addition to the same core questionnaire that the SIPP administered every wave, the SIPP includes topical modules containing a different theme. These topical modules contain detailed questions on selected topics, but the topics and questions differ across the duration of the panel. I utilized the Employer-Provided Health Benefits topical module to examine the sources of employer-sponsored health insurance and whether they are enrolled in those plans. This module was only administered once in each panel and is only available for years 1997, 2003, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f to consider only the first reference month of each wave to evaluate respondents' insurance statuses.

The study restricts the sample to couples who are not eligible to be insured by a parent or by Medicare without a medical need to limit the sources of private insurance to an individual or his or her spouse. It drops less than 2% of individuals who were married to someone absent from the household (institutionalized or living elsewhere). It also limits the sample to couples who remained married for at least two consecutive waves to calculate insurance transitions within an intact marriage. The final analysis sample comprised 131,999 individuals aged 26-64 in 79,128 marriages.

While some employers offer family health coverage to domestic partners, most limit eligibility to legally married spouses.

Cross-sectional distributions react slowly to changes in transition conditions and can mask year-to-year shifts in how likely people are to lose and gain insurance. During the study period, people moved in and out of insurance groups becoming uninsured or switching coverage to their spouses' plans. Some J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f years, people may be more likely to lose coverage, and in other years, people may be more likely to gain coverage. I used multinomial logistic regressions to estimate probabilities of switching from one insurance category to another while controlling for covariates: age, race, Hispanic origin, employment, and logged family income. Separate regressions estimated transition probabilities for each gender, education, and staring insurance category. I then converted these estimated probabilities into annualized rates and used these rates to derive a distribution that would emerge if the rates remained constant for a long time (also known as a stationary distribution). I compared the changes in the stationary distribution before and during recessions between low and high SES men and women.

Individuals may rely on their spouses for insurance as they transition between schools and jobs or when engaging in selfemployment. Spousal insurance allows people to pursue riskier opportunities with greater potential payout. Its role in coverage inequality, however, is reduced during periods of economic stability. In fact, the analyses find that more individuals without a college degree (especially men) relied on their spouses' plans during periods of low job loss and unemployment.

Adult children of higher SES parents are more likely to have uninterrupted private coverage than their lower SES counterparts; they can switch to their parents' plans should they lose their own. The advantages of family-based insurance plans may also apply to cohabiting couples. While fewer employers extend benefits to domestic partners than to married spouses (Employee Benefits Research Institute, 2004), a greater proportion of cohabiting households have two earners (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016).

The 1996 panel collected its first wave in March 1996 and continued till its twelfth wave in February 2000. The 2001 panel lasted for nine waves from January 2001 to December 2003 encompassing the 2001 recession. The 2004 panel had twelve waves from January 2004 to December 2007. The final 2008 panel collected data throughout the 2008 recession. Its first wave was in August 2008, a month before the official start of the recession and it collected its last wave in March 2013. The analyses combine these longitudinal panels to examine patterns of insurance sources and transitions across 17 years. Due to the gaps between the four SIPP panels, some months are not represented in the data.",

The 2008 recession lasted longer and had a greater impact on the labor market. It lasted 18 months from the end of 2007 to June 2009. Job loss climbed from a low in early 2006 to its peak in early 2009 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, n.d.). During the first quarter of 2009, about 2.7 million net jobs were lost (Bureau of Labor Statistics, n.d.). Unemployment reached ten percent in 2010 and did not return to its pre-recession levels until the end of 2015. The 2008 recession accompanied the highest rates of job loss with very low reemployment in full-time jobs compared to previous recessions (Farber, 2015).

The proportion of couples with either two or no sources of private coverage grew between the growing disparity in private insurance coverage between married persons with and without a college degree between 1996 and 2012. These differences are calculated from group-and year-specific insurance transition rates controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The total disparity in private coverage is decomposed into disparity due to the difference in coverage as the primary subscriber and difference in coverageas a dependent. Due to the gap between the 1996 and 2001 SIPP panels, data for 2000 in these figures are averages of 1999 and 2001 values. In 1996, college-graduate women were more likely to have private insurance than their non-college counterparts by 14 percentage points. That difference grew to 25 percentage points in 2012 (Figure 1). This rise in disparity was due to the growing gap in both own coverage and coverage through a spouse. The difference in having their own private coverage between college graduates and non-graduates was seven percentage points in 1996, and the difference increased to 15 percentage points in 2012. The difference in probability of being insured as a dependent was seven percentage points in 1996 and rose to 10 percentage points in 2012. Disparities in private insurance coverage spiked during years when national job loss exceeded job gain. Job loss peaked during the third and fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2009. These periods of high job loss coincided with the 2001 and 2008 recessions.During periods of low job loss before the two recessions (the first quarters of 1999 and 2006 respectively), 25% to 50% of the insurance coverage gap among married women is driven by",
