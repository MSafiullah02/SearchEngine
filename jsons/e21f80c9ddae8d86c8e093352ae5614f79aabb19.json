The Greeks applied human sewage to fields and recognized, as did the Romans, that animal and plant residues could be applied for the benefit of crop growth, the amounts required varying according to plant and soil type (Beaton, 2009) . In late medieval times, it was understood that the use of animal manure was to replace materials removed by the cultivation of crops (Wild, 1988) . The \"first factory for the manufacturing of synthetic manure,\" actually super phosphate, began business in 1842 (Allison, 1944; Dyke, 1993) . Although guano-accumulations of the droppings of seabirds or the dung of batsand some sodium nitrate mined in South America were commercially available as sources of N, at that time the main source of plant nutrients applied to crops in Europe and North America was farmyard manure ( Beaton, 2009) . This continued to be the position until the dramatic increase in availability of N fertilizers that began in the early 1950s. However, organic amendments continued to be the only form in which nutrients were added to soils in resource-poor regions (Thomas et al., 2006) and animal producers worldwide still spread manure and land application is an important means of disposal for sewage biosolids (Kelessidis and Stasinakis, 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 111, "text": "(Beaton, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 334, "end": 348, "text": "(Beaton, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 484, "end": 496, "text": "(Wild, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF577"}, {"start": 611, "end": 626, "text": "(Allison, 1944;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 627, "end": 638, "text": "Dyke, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 923, "end": 938, "text": "( Beaton, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1210, "text": "(Thomas et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF536"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1371, "text": "(Kelessidis and Stasinakis, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Although the primary reason for applying organic materials to agricultural land may be to recycle plant nutrients back to the soil, the return of organic matter also has importance.

With the importance of carbon sequestration in soil as one means of combating climate change, there is good reason to take a holistic view of the use of organic sources of nutrients and consider their importance in sustainable food production. Here we review the benefits associated with the application to the land of organic materials, particularly animal manure and sewage biosolids, in support of the plant growth together with the possible threats and risks to human health that can result from their use (Table 5 .1).

If the piles are not turned and new material from the barn is added regularly, solid or semisolid manure results. In the 1950s, efforts to reduce labor costs and improve hygiene in dairy barns resulted in bedding-free stalls and the removal of manure to a holding tank together with wash water. The liquid or slurry collected can then be applied to the land. Liquid manure systems have since been developed for other livestock and poultry. Beef and dairy operations create the greatest amount of manure, followed by pork units. Poultry production systems (broilers for meat and layers for eggs) make a much smaller contribution to total manure production than cattle or pig.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Animal Manure"}, {"text": "The majority of world manure production is land applied.

Manure is subject to change from the time that urine and feces are excreted and mixed, through periods of temporary storage in the barn and for the whole time they are in longer-term storage prior to application to land. As the enzyme \"urease\" is both widespread and somewhat resilient, mineralization of urea from the urine begins very rapidly after excretion even if it is not mixed with feces. The essential products are NH 4 + , HCO 3 \u2212 and OH \u2212 . The latter two ions increase the pH, which changes the balance between NH 4 + and NH 3 in solution, leading to the release of NH 3 into the atmosphere. Although the same processes occur with poultry excreta, which are a combination of materials from the digestive tract and the kidneys, there is less loss of NH 3 to the atmosphere because the material is much drier, unless water is added.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 184, "text": "(Beusen et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1332, "text": "(Beusen et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Animal Manure"}, {"text": "When liquid or slurry manure gets put into longer-term storage, the settling of materials can result in the formation of a number of layers, the properties of which vary considerably in space and time (Patni and Jui, 1987) .

However, one consequence of stratification is that anaerobic conditions develop within the stored manure. When free oxygen is not present, organic matter is converted to C compounds of small molecular weight, mainly volatile organic acids, and CH 4 gas is released. In addition, the breakdown of proteins can lead to the formation of H 2 S.

The final treatment stage is to stabilize the material, using heating and drying, alkaline stabilization to increase the pH, aerobic or anaerobic digestion together with heating, or composting. The stabilization process is intended to reduce or eliminate pathogens and make the material less attractive to scavengers after land application, which is either as a liquid, or as a cake following dewatering.

In MetHb, the iron in the heme group is oxidized but as the reaction is not readily reversible in neonates, tissues become starved of oxygen resulting in a cyanosis. However, the evidence suggests the need for a combination of high levels of NO 3 \u2212 and bacteria in the stomach for MetHb to develop (Addiscott and Benjamin, 2004; Rudolph et al., 1992; WHO, 1984) . However, the formation of MetHb can occur in the absence of high levels of NO 3 \u2212 in the diet as a response to gastroenteritis (Hegesh and Shiloah, 1982) . Under the normally very acid (pH 1 to pH 3) conditions in the stomach (and at various points in the mouth), NO 2 \u2212 (pKa 3.4) can be converted to NO and NO 2 (Benjamin et al., 1994) . However, in infants younger than 6 months and in a very few adults the levels of acidity are lower, possibly limiting the conversion. NO is a very effective antimicrobial agent, suggesting that its formation is consistent with a beneficial role for nitrate in our food and water (Addiscott and Benjamin, 2004) . Nevertheless, it is thought that in young infants NO released in response to gastroenteritis may enter the bloodstream and convert Hb to MetHb and the development of cyanosis. There is now evidence that deoxy-hemoglobin can reduce NO 2 \u2212 to NO, consistent with a protective role for nitrite in the circulatory system (Cosby et al., 2003) . The other concern is that in the stomach and intestines NO may form in response to chronic inflammation and following reaction with O 2 it can be converted to the nitrosating compounds N 2 O 3 and N 2 O 4 . These oxides of N can react with secondary and tertiary amines and with amides to form N-nitroso compounds (NOC), believed to be responsible for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. NOC have also been linked to other health issues, diabetes and adverse reproductive outcomes, such as premature births and congenital malformations (Ward et al., 2005) . L'hirondel and L'hirondel (2002) have provided a critical account of the evidence linking NO 2 \u2212 and NO 3 \u2212 intake to human health. For a discussion of the significance of these ions in the maintenance of a healthy body, see Bryan and van Grinsven (2012) . When organic amendments are stored, there is a health risk from volatilization of NH 3 following the hydrolysis of urea (cattle, sheep, pigs), uric acid (poultry) or its derivative ureides (Hristov et al., 2011) . The NH 3 can build up sufficiently to cause irritation in poorly ventilated barns and adversely affect the lungs of workers (Kirkhorn and Garry, 2000) . Ammonia has a strong, sharp characteristic odor, which can be a cause of great discomfort, especially for people suffering from asthma or allergies (Schiffman and Williams, 2005; Schiffman et al., 2000) . It is the irritation threshold levels, 4-8 ppm (v/v), rather than the odor threshold of 0.8 ppm (v/v), which can be a cause of the related health symptoms from NH 3 (Schiffman and Williams, 2005) . Human detection of NH 3 odor occurs at sufficiently small concentrations that harmful exposures are generally avoidable by moving away from the source. Residents downwind from a store of organic amendments releasing NH 3 can also experience health discomforts such as increased eye irritation, nausea, weakness and even psychological disorders (Schiffman et al., 1995; Thu et al., 1997) . However, the severity of the impact is determined by factors such as wind speed, wind direction and distance from the NH 3 source. For example, McGinn et al. (2003) observed that NH 3 concentrations declined asymptotically with distance, such that for two locations 200 m apart, the concentration was 65-82% less at the downwind site. The concentrations were generally greater during the evenings when wind speeds were less than during the day and dispersion was more limited.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 101, "end": 122, "text": "(Forman et al., 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 423, "end": 453, "text": "(Addiscott and Benjamin, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 454, "end": 475, "text": "Rudolph et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF451"}, {"start": 476, "end": 486, "text": "WHO, 1984)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 616, "end": 642, "text": "(Hegesh and Shiloah, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 802, "end": 825, "text": "(Benjamin et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1137, "text": "(Addiscott and Benjamin, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1477, "text": "(Cosby et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 2019, "end": 2038, "text": "(Ward et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF565"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2295, "text": "Bryan and van Grinsven (2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2509, "text": "(Hristov et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2662, "text": "(Kirkhorn and Garry, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2843, "text": "(Schiffman and Williams, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF461"}, {"start": 2844, "end": 2867, "text": "Schiffman et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF463"}, {"start": 3035, "end": 3065, "text": "(Schiffman and Williams, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF461"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3436, "text": "(Schiffman et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF462"}, {"start": 3437, "end": 3454, "text": "Thu et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF539"}, {"start": 3601, "end": 3621, "text": "McGinn et al.

While NH 3 itself is not a greenhouse gas, it may also contribute to global warming through nitrous oxides formation (Arogo et al., 2006) .

The provision of other metals can be required: for example, in North America animal diets may require the addition of selenium to avoid deficiency problems in the Great Lakes region, the pacific northwest of the U.S., and along much of the Atlantic coastal area (Ullrey, 1992) . Much of a trace element supplied in the feed ends up in the manure from the animals. Increased use of recycled paper in pulp mills has resulted in elevated levels of some trace elements, such as Cu and Zn, in paper mill biosolids.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 436, "end": 456, "text": "(Bolan et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 721, "end": 735, "text": "(Ullrey, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF544"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Trace Elements"}, {"text": "In addition to Cu and Zn, there can also be significant amounts of Cd (Table 5 .4), Pb and Cr in manure (Menzi and Kessler, 1998; Nicholson et al., 1999; Unwin, 1998) .

Information on the concentrations of different antibiotics in manure is scarce, but values vary greatly between source species and the type of operation (Table 5 .13). Degradation of antibiotics during storage of amendments is important in terms of total mass and the concentration at which they are applied to soil. Some antibiotics degrade rapidly in storage. For example, monensin, one of the most commonly used feed additives was degraded by about 85% within 11 weeks (Donoho, 1984) . However, found that monensin and tylosin had undergone a reduction of between 54 and 76% after composting was complete, consistent with a half-life in the process of 17 and 19 days respectively. The concentration of tylosin in beef calf manure declined below the limit of quantification within 30 days of storage (De Liguoro et al., 2003) . In contrast, concentrations of sulfdiazine and difloxacin in pig manure showed no decline after 150 days storage (Lamsh\u00f6ft et al., 2007) . The breakdown of tylosin appears to be enhanced with increased dry matter content of the manure (Loke et al., 2000) . Composting at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C reduced chlortetracycline and its isomer, iso-chlortetracycline by about 45% but between 36 and 45 \u00b0C more than 90% of oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline were eradicated.

(2011) found similar results for the breakdown of chlortetracycline and iso-chlortetracycline (that had been formed during the formation of windrows for composting) and for tylosin, but results for sulfamethazine were more varied (93% removal in year 1 of an experiment but only a 59% reduction in the repeat year). obtained no decrease in the content of sulfamethazine by composting spiked turkey litter, although chlortetracycline was almost completely degraded over the same time period.

Surface application of organic amendments can improve the C and N content in the top 5 cm of the soil but may have no significant effect below this (Peacock et al., 2001) . The magnitude of the effect depends on the dry matter content of the amendment. Consequently, effects can be small with liquid manure, such as that from pig (Angers et al., 2010) . The increase in C is associated with greater cation exchange capacity (Bernal et al., 1992; Bulluck et al., 2002) and better resilience of soil aggregates to raindrop impact (Bresson et al., 2001; Singh and Agrawal, 2008) , which in turn can improve infiltration and decrease runoff. In addition, adding organic matter to mineral soil increases water-holding capacity and porosity, and decreases bulk density (Wesseling et al., 2009) . Permeability of soil can also be enhanced because of greater macroporosity at depth where organic amendments have been applied (Munyankusi et al., 1994) . Johnston et al. (2009) reviewed the dynamics of soil organic matter and its effects on soil properties based on an analysis of the long-term experiments at Rothamsted Experimental Station (U.K.). The organic C content of a soil was a function of the input of organic material from crops or other sources, its rate of decomposition, the rate at which existing soil organic matter mineralized, soil texture, and climate. Under a given cropping system, the soil organic matter content tended toward an equilibrium level, which was greater for a clay soil than a sandy soil. Crop yields have tended to reflect the organic matter content of the soil. In part, this was the result of a greater annual release of N together with improved availability of P, when the amount of soil organic matter was enhanced. However, the loss of organic carbon was also greater under these conditions ( Johnston et al., 2009 ). Lack of organic C can reduce the surface charges in soil that are required for cation exchange and retaining basic elements, particularly Ca and Mg. This can result in increased soil acidity. Simply adding organic material is not entirely sufficient to counteract all the adverse changes in soil chemical and physical properties, since the nature and form of organic material is important in the formation of soil aggregates (Musgrave and Nichols, 1943) . By providing resources to enhance the activity of soil microbes, the functions of the soil can rebuild with time.

Garbeva et al.

Green manures are among the most effective of amendments in suppressing soil pathogens and animal pests, especially brassica crops that contain glucosinolate, a toxic secondary metabolite.

(2011) showed that brassicaceous oilseed meal was effective in inhibiting the germination of sclerotia and the subsequent growth of Phymatotrichopsis omnivora, the fungus responsible for cotton root rot. Similarly, soil application of rapeseed and crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst.) meals reduced the number of galls on tomato roots growing in a soil infested with eggs of the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne arenaria) (Walker, 1996) . Both meals, however, were phytotoxic to tomato and reduced the height of Celosia argentea L., Dianthus chinensis L., and rose periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don) plants, and resulted in poorer germination of periwinkle seed. When the planting of tomato was delayed for 3 weeks after addition of 1% meals, the phytotoxicity and root injury were diminished, but not alleviated. The ED 50 for rapeseed meal against peanut root-knot nematode was determined as 0.64% v/v when added to a piedmont soil and planting occurred immediately but increased to 0.86% if planting was delayed by just 1 week. Larkin and Griffin (2007) used experiments in the greenhouse and the field to evaluate the effectiveness of canola (Brassica napus L.), rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.), turnip (Brassica rapa var. rapa L.), yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.) and Indian mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.), for control of various soilborne potato pathogens and diseases. In vitro assays showed that volatiles released from chopped leaf material of Brassica crops and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) inhibited growth of a variety of soilborne pathogens of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), including Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora erythroseptica, Pythium ultimum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Fusarium sambucinam, with Indian mustard resulting in nearly complete inhibition (80-100%). All Brassicas and barley reduced inoculum levels of R. solani (20-56% reduction) in greenhouse tests, and radish, rapeseed and Indian mustard reduced subsequent potato seedling disease by 40-83%. In an on-farm field experiment at a site with a substantial powdery scab problem (caused by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea), Indian mustard, rapeseed, canola, and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) grown as green manure crops in the rotation reduced the disease in the subsequent potato crop by 15-40%, and canola and rapeseed reduced black scurf (caused by R. solani) by 70-80% relative to a standard oat rotation. At another field site where common scab (caused by Streptomyces scabies) was the primary disease problem, using Indian mustard as a green manure reduced the incidence of the disease by 25%, while rapeseed, yellow mustard and ryegrass also reduced black scurf relative to a standard ryegrass rotation. Disease reductions were not always associated with higher glucosinolate-producing crops but were also observed with non-Brassica crops, barley and ryegrass, indicating that other mechanisms and interactions are important, particularly for control of R. solani.

Broadcasting of liquids has traditionally used a splash-plate for distribution, and this is still used for liquid manure. In addition, there are low-level or low-pressure nozzles on booms, which offer the advantage that liquids can be distributed in bands between rows. Uniformity of application is less of an issue, but can result from changes in topography causing localized runoff and accumulation. Irrigation is usually by sprayer that is linked by pipes to the storage system. Odor issues tend to make this technique less acceptable to many. Furthermore, during irrigation the pH of the slurry tends to increase with the loss of volatile compounds, which may contribute to even greater volatilization of NH 3 as the manure droplets reach the soil (Safley et al., 1992) . Broadcasting manure and leaving it at the soil surface is likely to reduce the survival of pathogens. Sunlight reduces the longevity of bacteria, directly through the effect of ultraviolet light and as a result of drying (Gerba and Bitton, 1984; Mubiru et al., 2000; Sinton et al., 1999) . However, to capture as much of the NH 4 + -N as possible, broadcast soil amendments, especially those applied as a liquid, need to be incorporated as soon as possible after application (Beauchamp et al., 1982; Chantigny et al., 2004b) . This also reduces the risk that contaminants will be carried off-site in surface runoff water. However, it appears that incorporation of liquid amendments by disking forms bioaerosols with a greater emission rate than does the application process (Paez-Rubio et al., 2006 . Injection is associated with less bioaerosol formation than surface spreading (Millner, 2009 ). Spreading of dry waste, such as poultry litter, can also create considerable amounts of particulate material and bioaerosols (Millner, 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1090, "end": 1111, "text": "(Safley et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF456"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1359, "text": "(Gerba and Bitton, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1380, "text": "Mubiru et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF369"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1401, "text": "Sinton et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF486"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1613, "text": "(Beauchamp et al., 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1638, "text": "Chantigny et al., 2004b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1912, "text": "(Paez-Rubio et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF403"}, {"start": 1993, "end": 2007, "text": "(Millner, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF362"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2150, "text": "(Millner, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF362"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Impact of Application Techniques and Timing of Operations on Exposure"}, {"text": "Formation of bioaerosols and particulates is an important aspect of the airborne risk to humans.

The presence of roots can be one source of carbon for microbes (Goss and Kay, 2005; van Veen et al., 1997) and it can enhance their persistence (Avery et al., 2004; Turco and Brouder, 2004) . There is also evidence that some plant roots release compounds that reduce persistence of enteric pathogens in soil (Rothrock et al., 2012) . Given that soil microbes are generally carbon starved and that top soil undergoes periods of wetting and drying so that the water supply is uncertain, the survival of an organism depends on soil properties such as texture, pH, water and organic carbon content, adsorption properties, availability of nutrients, the temperature regime together with the composition of the indigenous population of soil organisms, and the chemical and physical nature of the organic amendment. They also depend on their own survival mechanisms (MacLean, 1983) . Among bacteria, many Gram-positive organisms form resistant spores, whereas in Gram-negative organisms physiological adaptation to environmental stress may involve the reduction in cell size and metabolic rate (Roszak and Colwell, 1987) . Although persistence in soil is very variable, bacteria introduced with manure can survive in soil for periods up to 120 days (Table 5 .16) (Nicholson et al., 2005; Nyberg et al., 2010; Rogers et al., 2011) . Variation in persistence can result from differences between the various sources (e.g. animal species), the form of amendment (liquid or solid) as well as soil type Hutchison et al. (2004b) ). (Nicholson et al., 2005; Unc and Goss, 2006a) . Although E. coli appears to persist longer if applied in solid rather than liquid amendments, Semenov et al. (2009) obtained the opposite result in one study with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. Enhanced soil organic matter content favors the persistence of enteric bacteria (Franz et al., 2008; Cools et al., 2001) as does a high level of nutrients (Gagliardi and Karns, 2000; Ravva and Korn, 2007; Unc et al., 2006) . Soil temperature is an important factor in bacterial survival, with persistence being longer in cold soils than in warm soils (Cools et al., 2001; Garc\u00eda et al., 2010) . However, the availability of water in soil overrides the impact of other factors (Gerba and Bitton, 1984; Mubiru et al., 2000) . Cools et al. (2001) found that the best survival of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. occurred in soils close to field capacity, while Garfield and Walker (2008) found that E. coli survived for less than 3 days at water potential of \u221222.4 MPa in animal feces. In a study of the persistence of 18 strains of E. coli O157, Franz et al. (2011) found that microbial survival time in a manure-amended sandy soil was directly related to the ability to oxidize propionic acid, \u03b1-ketobutyric acid and \u03b1-hydroxybutyric acid, with isolates from farm animals taking longer to decline to the limit of detection than those from humans. Solomon et al. (2002) and Looper et al. (2009a) observed movement of E. coli O157:H7 into plant tissue under field conditions and this was supported by laboratory studies (Warriner et al., 2003) . Although these reports were challenged by Johannessen et al. (2005) and Zhang et al. (2009) , further laboratory investigations by Fink et al. (2012) found that on undamaged lettuce leaves, E. coli O157:H7 altered the regulation of genes involved in the production of fibers used for attachment, the suppression of biofilm formation (upregulated) and metabolic rate (downregulated). These reports raise concerns about the use of organic amendments to provide nutrients for fresh-market vegetables, even if association with plant cells occurs infrequently (Erickson et al., 2010) , especially as one multistate outbreak of infection is believed to have originated from manure contamination of a lettuce crop (Hilborn et al., 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 123, "text": "(Sobsey, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF495"}, {"start": 189, "end": 209, "text": "(Goss and Kay, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 210, "end": 232, "text": "van Veen et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF555"}, {"start": 270, "end": 290, "text": "(Avery et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 291, "end": 315, "text": "Turco and Brouder, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF541"}, {"start": 434, "end": 457, "text": "(Rothrock et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF448"}, {"start": 985, "end": 1000, "text": "(MacLean, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF336"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1239, "text": "(Roszak and Colwell, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF447"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1406, "text": "(Nicholson et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF382"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1427, "text": "Nyberg et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF388"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1448, "text": "Rogers et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF445"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1640, "text": "Hutchison et al.

Lagoon acidification can be helpful in countering odors produced during decomposition of manure in storage, especially from NH 3 at pH values greater than 8.0, and in breaking up the sludge by enhancing microbial activity. Careful control is necessary to ensure that the pH of the lagoon does not fall below 6.2 as this favors H 2 S emission. So, for a dairy farmer desirous of using the dairy effluent as a nutrient source for his silage crop, the dilemma is to balance the trades-off associated with optimum crop growth, salt build up in soils and air quality regulations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 248, "text": "Bicudo et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 249, "end": 264, "text": "Neeteson, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF377"}, {"start": 466, "end": 485, "text": "(Amon et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 486, "end": 509, "text": "Demirer and Chen, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 510, "end": 528, "text": "Fitz et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 529, "end": 542, "text": "Parker, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF410"}, {"start": 543, "end": 561, "text": "Shen et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF477"}, {"start": 562, "end": 581, "text": "Smith et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF493"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FARMING PRACTICES TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM ORGANIC AMENDMENTS"}, {"text": "Injection of liquid organic amendments reduces NH 3 loss during application to arable crops as will surface banding or shallow incorporation under grass.

HACCP establishes the locations where intervention is needed to block pathways of exposure, while QRA establishes the relative importance of different pathways and the effectiveness of possible interventions. Presently, there is a need to clearly establish all the pathways and the critical control points in the production of food that involves the use of organic amendments.

(1995) identified that the ability to set the limits for activities at a specified control point was the important aspect of HACCP. Although it was acknowledged that, as a result of establishing good management practices in food processing facilities, HACCP provided a mechanism for ensuring production of safe food, ideally it would desirable to incorporate QRA. Notermans and Mead (1996) argued that incorporating QRA would permit the establishment of a better estimate of the probability of illness resulting in the human population from the presence of a specific contaminant in an item of food. Mayes (1998) also considered the advantages of incorporating QRA in the HACCP system. Based on risks from microbial contamination, Mayes concluded that potential benefits included an enhanced scientific basis for the hazard analysis, establishment of clear relationships between the critical limits, public health impacts and microbiological criteria.
