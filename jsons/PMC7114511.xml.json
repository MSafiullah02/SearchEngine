            "text": "Some RNA molecules easily become trapped in inactive conformations (kinetic traps) because of their structural and functional flexibility. These unproductive folds can be very stable and persistent. RNA chaperones existence was postulated to solve this RNA folding problem (Herschlag, 1995). Although RNA chaperone activity has been shown using different in vitro assays (see below), their in vivo activity was only recently demonstrated (Lorsch, 2002). RNA chaperones are non-specific nucleic acid binding proteins that rescue RNAs trapped in unproductive folding states (Cristofari and Darlix, 2002, Schroeder et al., 2004). One of the most important characteristics of RNA chaperones is that, once the RNA has been folded, they can be removed without alteration in the RNA conformation (Cristofari and Darlix, 2002, Rajkowitsch et al., 2005). RNA chaperone activity cannot be predicted based on the protein domain structure or the existence of discrete motifs. Nevertheless, RNA chaperones have the highest frequency of disordered regions, and it has been proposed that they act according to an entropy transfer model, allowing correct RNA folding by successive cycles of protein\u2013substrate order\u2013disorder (Fig. 1\n) (Dyson and Wright, 2005, Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2005, Tompa and Csermely, 2004). In fact, viral proteins with large disordered regions, postulated as RNA chaperones based on this criteria, act as nucleic acid chaperones, at least in vitro (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008, Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2007). The number of proteins with RNA chaperone activity is steadily growing [(Rajkowitsch et al., 2005), RCA website: http://www.projects.mfpl.ac.at/rnachaperones], but there is no consensus on the definition of RNA chaperone activity or the minimum assays required to establish the nucleic acid activity of a protein. Furthermore, the mode of action of RNA chaperones remains to be determined and a careful mechanistic comparison of several nucleic acid chaperones should be essential to achieve this objective (Rajkowitsch et al., 2005).",

It has been shown that RNA chaperones facilitate nucleic acid annealing. Nevertheless, annealing experiments must be carefully planned, as RNA annealing may occur in the absence of RNA chaperone activity. It is necessary to study activities including more than one step, and to perform the reactions in stringent conditions, such that only proteins with RNA chaperone activity could overcome all the requirements. To test activities that only RNA chaperones, but no other kind of proteins, could display, two strategies have been developed: (i) use of highly structured nucleic acid molecules, which requires a previous unwinding step by the RNA chaperone prior to the annealing, or (ii) protein elimination after base pairing has taken place (i.e., by treatment with proteinase K).",

Recently, an experimental approach consisting on detection of double-stranded molecules by FRET has been described. This technique includes a first annealing step and a second strand displacement reaction, mediated by the addition of an excess of non-labeled nucleic acid competitor. Therefore, this process combines real-time analysis of both reactions within the same experiment, measuring annealing and strand displacement before and after the addition of the competitor RNA, respectively (Rajkowitsch and Schroeder, 2007). These type of experiments should be more informative about RNA chaperone activity and could avoid the problems of simple assays that could lead to a misinterpretation of the results.",

The first system described was based on an in vivo RNA folding trap existing in the bacteriophage T4 thymidylate synthase (td) group I intron (Clodi et al., 1999). Several RNA chaperones, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, are able to resolve the kinetic trap or impede the formation of misfolded structures, therefore promoting intron splicing.

Vif is required in non-permissive cells to counteract cellular inhibitors of viral infection, such as APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F (Opi et al., 2006, Wiegand et al., 2004). It has been recently shown that Vif has RNA chaperone activity, and that it is involved in the early steps of reverse transcription. Vif enhances tRNA primer\u2013PBS annealing, decreases RT pausing and enhances SSDNA synthesis. Nevertheless, it has modest effects in NC-mediated strand transfer events that are different depending on the maturation product of NC used in the assays. It has been proposed that Vif could act as a negative temporal regulator preventing premature initiation of reverse transcription (Henriet et al., 2007).",

It is required for the transcription of integrated proviral DNA, driven by the 5\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence and the interaction of Tat with TAR element. Interaction of Tat with TAR recruits several transcription factors such as the TATA-binding protein, transcription factor TFIIB and positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFB). These interactions favor the hyperphosphorylation of the carboxy terminus domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II by the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) component of P-TEFB, allowing the elongation of the nascent RNA (Gatignol, 2007). Tat is a highly unstructured protein, and its RNA chaperone activity has been recently demonstrated (Kuciak et al., 2008). As an RNA chaperone, Tat enhances TAR DNA annealing, RNA\u2013DNA exchange, ribozyme cleavage and RNA trans-splicing. It has been proposed that, as an RNA chaperone, Tat may act at the levels of proviral DNA transcription, viral RNA splicing and suppression of silencing (Kuciak et al., 2008).",

Recently, based on disorder conservation in Flaviviridae core proteins, the RNA chaperone activity of core proteins from different members of each genera has been analyzed. It has been found that, although core proteins from different Flaviviridae genera have low sequence similarity, all of them have RNA chaperone activity (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008). Furthermore, data strongly suggest that nucleic acid chaperone activity resides in disordered regions of Flaviviridae core proteins as their RNA chaperone activity is resistant to heat denaturation of the protein (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008).",

Their genomes are positive-sense, ssRNAs of around 30 kb, the largest known viral RNA genomes. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genomic RNA encode the replicase genes (rep1a and rep1ab). The 3\u2032 one-third of the genome encodes structural and non-structural proteins (Fig. 6A). Coronavirus replication and transcription occur in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and are based on RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Transcription leads to a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that are 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-coterminal with the viral genome. These sg mRNAs are generated by a discontinuous process (Fig. 7\n) that implies base pairing of nascent RNAs of negative polarity, driven by the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) preceeding each gene, and sequences located at the 3\u2032-end of the leader within the genomic RNA (Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005, Sawicki et al., 2007, Sola et al., 2005, Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2004).",

RNA chaperone activity was recently reported for one of these products, the 3AB precursor, that has annealing and helix-destabilizing activities (DeStefano and Titilope, 2006). 3B protein, also named as VPg, is linked to the 5\u2032-end of the viral genome and acts as primer for viral RNA synthesis. 3A protein was proposed as the protein that anchors the replication complexes to membranes. 3AB precursor stimulates RNA synthesis by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and has RNA chaperone activity. Nevertheless, its role as RNA chaperone in the viral life cycle is unclear.",

First, the termination of nascent strand synthesis might be mediated by secondary RNA structures located either in the template or in the nascent strand, as described for prokaryotic (Wilson and von Hippel, 1995) or eukaryotic (Reeder and Lang, 1997) RNA polymerases. Extensive studies have been made on HIV RT pausing and on secondary RNA structures influencing this process. It has been shown that the RT pausing could be promoted by a highly structured hairpin. This RT slow-down should increase RNase H cleavages at the site of pausing, increasing template switch at this location (Basu et al., 2008, Roda et al., 2003). In coronavirus little is known about secondary structures and pausing sites, although 5\u2032 TRS sequence secondary structures are good candidates for stopping signals (Enjuanes et al., 2007). TRS secondary structures could be specially relevant in the case of torovirus non-discontinuous transcription (Smits et al., 2005), that resembles the premature transcription termination mechanism of tombusviruses (Lin and White, 2004, White, 2002, White and Nagy, 2004). In these viruses, it has been proposed that RNA secondary structures formed in the genome, upstream to the transcription initiation sites, could facilitate transcription termination (White and Nagy, 2004).",

In contrast, a secondary structure on one of the nucleic acid molecules is not required for either the minus or the plus strand transfer events. In fact, for an efficient template switch, the unwinding of a stable secondary structure must occur, both in the minus and plus strand transfer (Basu et al., 2008, Levin et al., 2005). NC protein plays a key role in this process, acting as an RNA chaperone (Hong et al., 2003, Wu et al., 1999). One of the determinant steps in HIV minus strand transfer is the annealing of the two highly structured TAR sequences (Basu et al., 2008, Levin et al., 2005). Without the nucleic acid chaperone activity of NC, the annealing reactions would occur much more slowly, as NC increases the annealing of structured sequences around 3000-fold, depending on the assays (Basu et al., 2008, Levin et al., 2005, Vo et al., 2006, Zeng et al., 2007).",

In fact, a leader stem-loop structure was predicted for several nidovirus, and its existence and relevance on RNA synthesis has been shown for equine arteritis arterivirus (EAV) (van den Born et al., 2004, van den Born et al., 2005) and for TGEV coronavirus (J.L. Moreno, D. Dufour, I. Sola, J. Gallego, L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). In coronavirus template switch, the annealing of the leader and nascent minus RNA sequences complementary to the body TRSs is one of the main factors regulating transcription. It has been demonstrated that the free-energy of the duplex formation between those sequences is the driving force of template switch, regulating the amount of each sg mRNA, and the places where template switch takes place (Sola et al., 2005, Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2004). Acting as an RNA chaperone, N protein could be involved in the correct folding of the leader structure. In fact, it has been proposed that N protein could mediate the annealing of TRSs by decreasing the energy barrier required for this process (Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2007). Nowadays, our group is working on the design of an in vivo system to analyze template switch step during coronavirus transcription.",

These systems could be used to analyze the role of chaperones on template switch. The main limitation of these in vitro systems is that the precise components required to reproduce the activity still need to be identified and, very likely, in addition to viral RNA chaperones, cellular ones could be part of the purified active complexes. An alternative is to develop in vitro systems based on defined components, similarly to the current retrovirus in vitro systems. Acceptor and donor RNAs must be carefully selected, attending to the features to be assayed. Probably, the key difficulty in the development of these in vitro systems is the precise number of protein components required. The RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) from SARS-CoV has been purified and its polymerization activity has been shown (Cheng et al., 2005). In addition RNA chaperones and other still unidentified proteins will be required for a fully functional in vitro system.",

In 1995, based on some in vitro observations, and from the point of view of the existence of a functional association between RNA and proteins, RNA chaperone activity was postulated (Herschlag, 1995). Since then, several RNA chaperones have been identified using diverse in vitro assays, or postulated, based on the effects observed when these proteins are mutated. A helpful attempt to provide a precise and restricted definition of RNA chaperone activity has recently been reported (Rajkowitsch et al., 2007). According to this definition, RNA chaperones are proteins that resolve misfolded RNAs, and that also must fulfill several requirements: (i) transient interaction with the nucleic acid, mainly due to a weak and low specificity RNA\u2013protein binding; (ii) lack of requirement of an external energy input, such as ATP hydrolysis; and (iii) lack of RNA\u2013protein interaction requirement to maintain the functional RNA conformation.",

New technologies that monitor single molecules have been used to clarify the mechanism of RNA chaperone activity by measuring RNA folding in real-time. These approaches include force spectroscopy and single-molecule stretching using optical tweezers, and time-resolved NMR (Furtig et al., 2007, Williams et al., 2002, Williams et al., 2001).

These assays must be concentrated on measurements performed using RNA, it also must be shown that after the initial steps protein can be removed, and that the process is independent of external energy sources (Rajkowitsch et al., 2007).

Negative polarity DNA synthesis is initiated using a partially unwound tRNA annealed to the primer-binding site (PBS, in red) at the 5\u2032-end of the viral genomic RNA. The reverse transcriptase elongates the 3\u2032-end of tRNA, synthesizing the (\u2212) strong-stop DNA (SSDNA), complementary to U5 and R. RNase H activity of RT degrades R and U5 sequences in the retroviral genomic RNA. The first RT template switch occurs, and the minus strand DNA anneals with R sequences at the 3\u2032-end of the genomic RNA. RT elongates the negative-strand DNA to synthesize a (\u2212) DNA strand complementary to the viral genome. RNase H degrades all viral genomic RNA except the polypurine tract (PPT, in yellow) sequence. The RT begins the synthesis of positive strand DNA using PPT RNA as a primer. The RNA primer is degraded by RNase H, and the second RT template switch occurs, annealing the (+) DNA PBS (in red) with its complementary sequence on the (\u2212) DNA strand. Finally, RT elongates both strands to complete synthesis of a double-stranded proviral DNA. Positive polarity RNA and DNA strands are represented in dark colors. Negative polarity DNA strands are shown in light colors. Long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences are shown in grey. Steps in which RNA chaperones have a role are indicated by the red ellipses.",
