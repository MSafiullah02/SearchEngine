A focused screening and lead optimization effort identified 4b (GS-5734) with anti-EBOV EC 50 = 86 nM in macrophages as the clinical candidate. Structure activity relationships established that the 1\u2032-CN group and C-linked nucleobase were critical for optimal anti-EBOV potency and selectivity against host polymerases. A robust diastereoselective synthesis provided sufficient quantities of 4b to enable preclinical efficacy in a non-human-primate EBOV challenge model. Once-daily 10 mg/kg iv treatment on days 3\u221214 postinfection had a significant effect on viremia and mortality, resulting in 100% survival of infected treated animals [Nature 2016, 531, 381\u2212385]. A phase 2 study (PREVAIL IV) is currently enrolling and will evaluate the effect of 4b on viral shedding from sanctuary sites in EBOV survivors. a Data reported are at least n \u2265 2 in 384 well assay format unless otherwise noted. b HMVEC cells = TERT-immortalized human foreskin microvascular endothelial cells (ATCC-4025) cells. c 96 well assay format. d n = 1 data only.",

More than 20 intermittent outbreaks have occurred since then, but the most recent outbreak in West Africa spanning 2013\u22122016 has been the largest recorded in history and presented an international public health emergency. 1 Over 28,000 cases were confirmed in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone resulting in >11,000 deaths including >500 healthcare workers, which severely strained the local medical infrastructure. 2 In survivors, the Ebola virus (EBOV) can persist in bodily fluids for months after the onset of acute infection potentially leading to EVD-related sequelae and viral recrudescence. 3 While rare, secondary transmission has been documented to occur through sexual intercourse implicating persistent virus in genital secretions. 4 Despite the end of the current outbreak, the potential for equally devastating future outbreaks together with the persistent virus observed in survivors makes the development of a safe, effective, and readily available treatment option for EVD a high priority.",

Other Filoviridae family members include Marburg, Sudan, and Bundibugyo viruses, which have all been responsible for outbreaks associated with high mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa. 5, 6 Over the course of the recent West African EVD outbreak, several direct acting anti-Ebola agents including monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), 7 interfering-RNAs, 8 \u221210 and small molecule nucleoside(tide) antivirals such as favipiravir (1), 11\u221213 and brincidofovir (2) 14 have been evaluated in early clinical trials (Figure 1 ). More recently another nucleoside analogue, galidesivir (3, BCX4430 15 ), has entered clinical development. These developments are encouraging, but to date, none of these potential therapeutics have established robust clinical efficacy for the treatment of acute infection or the viral persistence and sequelae. Several vaccines have shown strong promise for preventing EBOV infection, but the breadth and durability of protection they can afford has yet to be established. 16 Prior to the Ebola outbreak, we had embarked on a strategic initiative aimed at evaluating the potential of nucleoside analogues for the treatment of selected emerging viruses. A library of \u223c1000 diverse nucleoside and nucleoside phosphonate analogues was harnessed from over 2 decades of research across multiple antiviral programs. In collaboration with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), selected compounds from the library were screened against EBOV, leading to the identification of parent 4 and a potent monophosphate prodrug mixture 4a that contained the single Sp isomer 4b (GS-5734 17 ) that was selected for development. This report describes in detail the structure activity relationships (SAR) of the parent nucleoside, prodrug optimization and selection, and synthesis optimization of the development candidate 4b. Candidate compound 4b is currently in phase 2 trials to assess the effect on the chronic shedding of virus in EVD survivors following promising efficacy data established in a non-human-primate (NHP) EVD challenge model. These data have been recently reported 17 and will be summarized along with the early clinical experience with 4b.",

            "text": "The assembly of the \u223c1000 compound nucleos(t)ide screening library was heavily focused toward ribose analogues that could target RNA viruses since this would encompass many emerging viral infections ranging from respiratory pathogens belonging to the Coronaviridae family such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), to mosquito-borne viruses of the Flaviviridae family such as Dengue and Zika. The majority of the library compounds were nucleosides that contained a cyclic modified ribose or \"ribose-like\" core. These nucleosides were also predominantly N-nucleosides. Less than 10% of the library comprised nucleoside phosphonates or acyclic analogues due to the limited success, to date, in identifying potent RNA virus inhibitors with these types of analogs. A second key factor in the library assembly was that approximately 50% of the library included monophosphate and ester prodrugs to capture analogs that may be missed in cellular screens due to either poor permeability or inefficient metabolism in the respective cell types that the different antiviral assays utilize. Nucleoside analogs require activation by intracellular nucleoside/tide kinases to generate their respective nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) metabolites in order to then compete with endogenous natural nucleotide pools for incorporation into the replicating viral RNA. 17 The first phosphorylation step to generate the nucleoside monophosphate is often rate limiting, and therefore the application of monophosphate prodrugs, especially phosphoramidates (ProTides), has been extensively explored in nucleoside analogs to bypass this initial phosphorylation step. 18 A notable example includes the phosphoramidate prodrug Sofosbuvir (5) for the treatment of HCV ( Figure  1 ). 19 Nucleoside phosphonate analogs are bioisosteres of the monophosphates but also require prodrugs to enable masking of the charged phosphonate acid thereby allowing more efficient entry into cells. A recent example of an approved drug in this class is the phosphonamidate prodrug tenofovir alafenamide (6) for the treatment of HIV. 20 In both examples the amidate prodrugs effectively deliver high levels of triphosphate (diphosphophosphonate in the case of nucleoside phosphonates) inside the target cells and demonstrate significant improvements in potency compared to their respective parent nucleos(t)ides when screened in antiviral assays. 20, 21 In the original library screening toward a panel of RNA viruses across different viral families, promising leads were identified. Subsequent to the EVD outbreak, some of these analogs were selected for EBOV testing in collaboration with the CDC and USAMRIID in a BSL-4 facility. From this screen nucleoside 4, 22 a 1\u2032-CN modified adenosine C-nucleoside emerged with sub-micromolar activity toward EBOV in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-TERT) cells (entry 2, Table 1 ).

            "text": "To interrogate the cell based SAR more rigorously the active NTP metabolite 4tp 23 was tested toward the viral polymerases ( Table 2 ). The triphosphate 4tp demonstrated a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 1.1 \u03bcM against the RSV RdRp and 5.0 \u03bcM against HCV RdRp. The Ebola viral polymerase has to date evaded efforts toward its isolation and expression, so the intrinsic activity of the active NTP metabolite cannot be directly evaluated. An alternate method for estimating the inhibitory properties of an NTP for its viral target is to measure the NTP levels inside cells following incubation with the parent or prodrug compound at a given concentration and then calculate the NTP levels at the EC 50 measured in the same cells. 17 For example, in a continuous 72 h incubation of 1 \u03bcM 4a, the 4tp levels were measured at 2, 24, 48, and 72 h, and reached a C max of 300, 110, and 90 pmol/ million cells in macrophages, HMVEC, and HeLa cells lines, respectively. The several-fold difference in maximum 4tp levels is not unusual and reflects the differences between cells with respect to their ability to break down the prodrug and subsequently metabolize the released monophosphate to the active 4tp. The average NTP levels over the 72 h incubation of 4a were then used along with an average cell volume of 2 pL 29 to calculate an estimated half-maximal inhibitory concentration of \u223c5 \u03bcM for the intracellular inhibition of EBOV polymerase. This is comparable in potency toward RSV and HCV polymerases supporting the potent antiviral EC 50 data demonstrated for the prodrug mixture 4a across the three viruses when allowing for cell differences ( Table 1 ). The selective inhibition of the viral polymerases vs host polymerases is considered a key factor in the development of a safe and effective nucleoside antiviral. 30, 31 Therefore, 4tp was evaluated toward several host polymerases and was found to be a weak incorporator toward mitochondrial polymerase (POLRMT) and not a substrate for DNA polymerase \u03b3, as would be expected given the presence of the ribose 2\u2032 OH (Table 2) . Across the host RNA and DNA polymerases evaluated there was no inhibition up to 200 \u03bcM (Table 2 ) demonstrating a high degree of selectivity of 4tp toward the viral polymerases compared to representative examples of host polymerases.",

On docking the triphosphate 4tp, the 1\u2032-CN group occupies a pocket formed by residues that are identical between EBOV and RSV, yet very different in HCV ( Figure 2a ). Nevertheless the 1\u2032-CN analogue retains antiviral potency across these viruses and others 17 suggesting that a pocket exists to accommodate the 1\u2032-CN group in many viral polymerases including other filoviruses. 33 The 2\u2032-\u03b2-H of 4tp is in close proximity to E709, and replacement of this group with a 2\u2032-\u03b2-methyl (13tp) would be anticipated to interfere with E709 ( Figure 2b ). 34 However, the 2\u2032-\u03b2-methyl can be accommodated by the larger pocket afforded by the smaller S282 residue of HCV ( Figure 2c ). This suggests the lack of activity for 2\u2032-\u03b2-methyl analogs toward EBOV and RSV and retained potency toward HCV is likely due to steric constraints in the polymerase active site. Consistent with the model, EBOV and RSV both have the E709 or equivalent residue, and 13tp was found to be significantly less active (IC 50 > 30 \u03bcM) toward RSV. The screening and modeling efforts established 4 as the best lead for prodrug optimization. The ability to evaluate prodrugs, especially in vivo, required an efficient synthesis route for both the nucleoside 4 and, preferably, a single prodrug diastereoisomer. Neither was available at the outset, so significant chemistry resources were applied to improve the robustness and scalability of the route along with generation of single prodrug diastereoisomers. The first generation synthesis of 4 and the single Sp phosphoramidate prodrug 4b commenced with a glycosylation reaction via metal\u2212halogen exchange of the bromo-base 15 followed by addition into the ribolactone 14 (Scheme 1). Two conditions were identified to render this desired C\u2212C bond formation. The first condition (a) proceeded through addition of excess n-BuLi to a mixture of TMSCl and 15, which was designed to result in lithium\u2212 halogen exchange after removal of the acidic 6N protons by silyl protection. Addition of this in situ generated reagent to the ribolactone 14 then afforded 16 in 25% yield. 23 ",

Nonproximally branched esters of alanine with increasing log D ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 (entries 5, 11, and 12) demonstrated increased potency. Esters that contained proximal branching without cyclic motifs e.g. i-Pr, t-Bu, and 3-pentyl (entries 7, 8, and 10, respectively) were generally less active, consistent with the increased steric hindrance that likely slows the cleavage rate by esterases. For example, the proximally branched 3-pentyl ester 4l (entry 10) has comparable log D to that of the neopentyl analogue 4m (entry 11) yet much lower potency. In contrast, cyclic butyl and pentyl esters (entries 6 and 9, respectively) are more potent than 4l despite the proximal branching and lower log D, although the potency in the HeLa cell assay was reduced. The D-Ala 2-EtBu mixture (entry 15) was less potent that the corresponding L-Ala analogue mixture (entry 12), and the two bisphosphoramide prodrugs (entries 16 and 17) also had reduced activity compared to their monoamidate counterparts (entries 5 and 12, respectively). Thus, based on antiviral properties across HeLa and HMVEC cells, the most promising monophosphoramidate prodrugs were the neopentyl ester 4m (single undefined isomer) and 2-EtBu ester mixture 4a. The Sp and Rp isomers of 4a (entries 14 and 13, respectively) were separated and found to be similar in potency, but both were marginally more potent than 4m. For the intended iv route of administration, plasma stability was not deemed critical in the selection process provided sufficient stability (t 1/2 > 60 min) was maintained to allow loading of target cells harboring the virus during drug infusion. The selection of 4b was made based on the high potency across multiple cell lines and the crystalline nature of the Sp prodrug reagent 22b that allowed rapid scale up for efficacy and IND enabling studies of the single Sp isomer 4b.",

Due to the high first pass hepatic extraction of phosphoramidates, oral administration was also not explored in favor of injectable routes of administration. Moreover, oral delivery in patients acutely infected with EBOV that are demonstrating symptoms of the disease may not be ideal because gastrointestinal symptoms may limit the dose that is effectively absorbed. Intravenous administration of 4b in rhesus monkeys demonstrated rapid elimination of prodrug and appearance of parent nucleoside in systemic circulation ( Figure  4a ). However, 4b also rapidly distributed to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and triphosphate levels in PBMCs were elevated to a maximum within 2 h (Figure 4b) . A dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in an estimated PBMC triphosphate level at 24 h that was several-fold higher than the estimated IC 50 of 5 \u03bcM for EBOV, with a half-life of 14 h similar to that measured in vitro in human macrophages. The long intracellular half-life of 4tp supported once-daily iv administration in the rhesus efficacy study and in the clinical program. Preclinical in vivo efficacy for 4b was conducted in an EBOVinfected rhesus challenge model. The overall strategy was to determine a maximally efficacious dose of 4b that could be safely administered and to understand whether delayed time of treatment would be effective, a property that was considered critical for the successful clinical application of 4b. These studies have recently been published in full and will only be summarized here. 17 The starting dose of 3 mg/kg iv was modeled based on the 4tp levels in rhesus PBMCs following 10 mg/kg iv dosing to have the potential for inhibiting Ebola viral replication in vivo. A correlation of the in vitro antiviral activity and intracellular metabolism described earlier suggested the 3 mg/kg dose would produce 4tp levels that exceed the estimated IC 50 for most of the dosing interval. Compound 4b was dosed iv at 3 mg/kg on day 0 or day 2 relative to EBOV inoculation, and continued once daily for 12 days. Systemic viremia was reduced and survival out to day 28 postinfection was improved. Animals administered 3 mg/kg 4b, starting at day 0, had a survival rate of 33% while those initiated on day 3 had a 66% survival at 28 days. These encouraging data were then followed with a second study in which one arm explored dosing initiation on day 3 with 10 mg/kg daily for 12 days to assess whether increased dose compared to the 3 mg/kg result could be more efficacious. Two other arms explored an initial loading dose of 10 mg/kg on day 2 or day 3, followed by 11 3 mg/kg daily maintenance doses. All of the animals in the two arms in which 4b treatments were initiated on day 3 (n = 12 total) survived through day 28, the end of study. In the daily 10 mg/ kg dosed group the effect on viremia was consistently greater than in any of the other groups and was below the limit of quantitation (8 \u00d7 10 4 RNA copies mL \u22121 ) in four of the six animals on days 5 and 7 relative to the vehicle-treated control in which the geometric mean exceeded 10 9 copies mL \u22121 at these time points. These data established the effectiveness of 4b in treatment of EVD in NHPs and accelerated its progress into clinical development. In addition to the efficacy studies, distribution studies in cynomolgus monkeys using [ 14 C]4b at the same effective dose of 10 mg/kg established the presence of drug-related products in the potential sanctuary sites for the virus including testes, epididymis, eyes, and brain. 17 At 4 h postdose, the drug levels in the testes and epididymis exceeded those observed in plasma, and even at 168 h postdose detectable levels of drug-related products were still observed in the testes. Exposure levels in the brain were lower than other tissues, including plasma at 4 h, but were detectable above the plasma levels at 168 h indicating a long half-life of exposure in brain relative to plasma. These data supported the potential that 4b treatment may also reduce persistence of virus in these sanctuary sites.",

The first case involved a healthcare worker who had survived acute infection but had relapsed with symptoms of acute meningoencephalytis. 42 Ebola virus was detected both systemically in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid. When treated with monoclonal antibodies, the patient developed adverse reaction and was subsequently treated with supportive therapy and 4b for a period of 14 days beginning with a dose of 150 mg and then increasing to 225 mg after two daily infusions. No serious adverse effects related to drug were observed. The patient recovered and cleared the virus from both plasma and CNS although without proper control or natural history data to compare, it is not clear whether the antiviral therapy was effective. The second case involved a newborn infant congenitally infected with EBOV and treated with monoclonal antibodies, blood transfusion, and subsequently 4b. 43 The infant recovered and was eventually declared free of Ebola virus after repeated testing failed to detect viremia. The unprecedented scale of the West African epidemic and the ability to reduce mortality rates through supportive therapy has resulted in many survivors of EVD. The persistence of virus sequelae in survivors in multiple body compartments has now been documented in addition to secondary sexual transmission via virus in genital secretions. 4 This has prompted the initiation of a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 study (PREVAIL IV) which plans to enroll at least 60 adult male survivors to receive either 100 mg of 4b or placebo once-daily over 5 days to assess the effect of 4b therapy on the viral shedding in semen. 44 The results of this study could provide the first evidence as to the potential of 4b to reduce virus replication in humans.",

We identified a promising nucleotide therapeutic 4b through initial screening and subsequent optimization of the prodrug moiety for iv administration. The partnership with government organizations, including CDC and USAMRIID, that generated the screening data and conducted the rhesus efficacy studies was critical to the successful identification of 4b. Also of importance was the significant chemistry effort that rapidly identified a more efficient route to the parent compound 4 and the ability to prepare, through crystallization of a key reagent, the single Sp phosphorus diastereoisomer 4b for in vivo model studies. The active triphosphate delivered by the prodrug has low micromolar polymerase activity toward EBOV, high selectivity for the viral polymerase compared to host polymerases, and a long intracellular half-life supporting once-daily administration. Parenteral treatment with 4b in EBOV infected NHPs at 10 mg/kg over 12 days demonstrated a substantial antiviral effect along with 100% survival.
