Moreover, the greater incidences of cross contamination and overuse of drugs has contributed towards the development of drug resistant microbial strains making conditions even worse. Hospital acquired infections pose one of the leading complications associated with implantation of any biomaterial after surgery and critical care. In this regard, developing non-conventional antimicrobial agents which would prevent the aforementioned causes is under the quest. The rapid development in nanoscience and nanotechnology has shown promising potential for developing novel biocidal agents that would integrate with a biomaterial to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Metals with inherent antimicrobial properties such as silver, copper, zinc at nano scale constitute a special class of antimicrobials which have broad spectrum antimicrobial nature and pose minimum toxicity to humans. Hence, novel biomaterials that inhibit microbial growth would be of great significance to eliminate medical device/instruments associated infections. This chapter comprises the state-of-art advancements in the development of nano-antimicrobial biomaterials for biomedical applications. Several strategies have been targeted to satisfy few important concern such as enhanced long term antimicrobial activity and stability, minimize leaching of antimicrobial material and promote reuse. The proposed strategies to develop new hybrid antimicrobial biomaterials would offer a potent antibacterial solution in healthcare sector such as wound healing applications, tissue scaffolds, medical implants, surgical devices and instruments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The recent progresses in health care sector have witnessed the use of biomaterials for improving life quality of critically ill patients. Biomaterials have revolutionized a few emerging areas such as biomedical engineering and tissue engineering by facilitating less-invasive techniques for continuous monitoring, improving drug administrating and enhanced mobility by either restoring or replacing organ functions (Hench and Polak 2002; Place et al. 2009; Hubbell 1995) . As compared to the conventional technologies, biomaterials with improved functionality and durability have been utilized in form of vascular grafts, biocompatible coatings, medical implants, stents tissue scaffolds which might remain functional even for several months (Place et al. 2009; Ratner et al. 2004) . Despite considerable success of biomaterials in ageing society, only a few biomaterials can prove their safety concerns under practically relevant conditions. Regardless of implant composition and applications, i.e., from prosthetic joints, artificial heart and dental implants to vascular valves and intraocular lenses, virtually all biomaterials behave as a \"niche\" to pathogenic microorganisms (Zaat et al. 2010; Busscher et al. 2012; Stewart and Costerton 2001) . Under in vivo conditions, the microbes get attracted and subsequently lead to biofilm formation on biomaterial surface, leading to one of the major clinical complications often referred as biomaterial-associated infections (BAIs) (Percival et al. 2015; Campoccia et al. 2013a; Zaat et al. 2010; Busscher et al. 2012; Stewart and Costerton 2001) . The greater incidences of biomaterial-associated infections thus compromise with the intended use of any implant or device and add risk to humans in terms of high morbidity and even mortality (Parsek and Singh 2003; Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley 2009 ). Moreover, it marks an adverse impact on economy since the existing treatment strategies to cure infection could cost even more than the initial biomaterial implantation. In a broad sense, a biomaterial faces two major challenges when implanted within the body i.e., to make suitable integration with native tissue while preventing colonization of microbes on its surface. In 1987, an orthopedic surgeon Anthony Gristina introduced a phrase \"the race for the surface\" referring that there exists a stern competition between tissue integration and bacterial attachment on biomaterial surface (Gristina 1987) . A successful implantation of biomaterial without any infection would thus be a 'winning' situation for its intended use, though it is not the case with few of them.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 437, "text": "(Hench and Polak 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 438, "end": 456, "text": "Place et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 457, "end": 470, "text": "Hubbell 1995)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 742, "end": 761, "text": "(Place et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 762, "end": 781, "text": "Ratner et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1199, "text": "(Zaat et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1221, "text": "Busscher et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1249, "text": "Stewart and Costerton 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1504, "text": "(Percival et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1528, "text": "Campoccia et al. 2013a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1546, "text": "Zaat et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1568, "text": "Busscher et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1596, "text": "Stewart and Costerton 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1814, "text": "(Parsek and Singh 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1846, "text": "Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 2440, "end": 2455, "text": "(Gristina 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Biomaterial-associated infections are most commonly caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus schleiferi, Staphylococcus lugdunensis\u201a Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Candida albicans, Propionibacterium acnes including a few other bacterial strains having low virulence potential on healthy individuals but resides within skin and mucous membranes (Jukes et al. 2010; Mack et al. 2013 ). The cascade for pathogenesis of BAIs follows a series of common events (Costerton et al. 1999; Parsek and Singh 2003; Busscher et al. 2012; Stewart and Costerton 2001) . First step involves an initial attachment of microbial cells to biomaterial surface while the attached cells start accumulating in multiple layers leading to the formation of biofilm as a second step. Subsequently, the maturation of microbial biofilm takes place and finally, microbial consortium is detached for spreading to other parts of biomaterial surface. The implants are thus susceptible to many infections, as direct contamination to biomaterial surface during surgery starts even after few hours of implantation i.e., preoperative contamination (Maathuis et al. 2005; Campoccia et al. 2013b ). The site of implant can also be accessed to microbes during hospitalization, known as hospital-acquired infections. The spreading of microbes occur due to microbial contamination on several locations other than the implant site through blood stream i.e., post-operative infections and is inevitable (Siegel et al. 2007; Campoccia et al. 2013b) .

Sessile and adherent bacteria are thus intrinsically more resistant towards host clearance and require nearly 500-5,000 times higher concentration of common clinical antibiotics than planktonic or non-biofilm forming pathogens (Boucher et al. 2009; Donlan and Costerton 2002; Subbiahdoss et al. 2013) . The therapeutic and prophylactic use of antibiotics for curing post operative infections has even contributed towards the development of microbial strains with high resistance against those drugs making conditions unmanageable. Ultimately, the removal of an infected implant would be the only possible solution followed by weeks of antibiotic treatment to remove infection before implantation of new device (Maathuis et al. 2005; Campoccia et al. 2013b; Busscher et al. 2012; Ratner et al. 2004) . For these reasons, local or topical administration of antibacterial agents is preferred over routine systemic approaches which would minimize an initial attachment of bacteria on implant surfaces. Accordingly, a promising strategy for reducing the occurrence of BAIs is to prevent an initial attachment of bacteria to implant and device surfaces (Bazaka et al. 2012; Salwiczek et al. 2014; Monteiro et al. 2009 ). This has spurred research efforts on developing antimicrobial surfaces and coatings that can be applied to biomedical devices so as to confer resistance against bacterial colonization. To achieve this, the antibacterial biomaterial surface should reflect non-cytotoxic characteristics against mammalian cells and it should not pose any adverse effects on healthier tissues and body fluids of patients (Harding and Reynolds 2014; Norowski and Bumgardner 2009) .

Owing to its small size, nanomaterials have high surface area to volume ratio which makes them more effective even at relatively lower dose concentration than their bulk form (Mauter and Elimelech 2008; Sharma et al. 2009; Rai et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2008) . Moreover, the mechanism of antimicrobial action of nanomaterials can be mediated through several pathways, i.e., disruption of bacterial membrane, formation of holes and pits on cell wall, generation of ROS, binding to sulfhydryl groups of metabolic enzymes of the bacterial electron transport chain to inhibit respiratory activity, and integration with DNA (Kumar et al. 2008; Morones et al. 2005; Rai et al. 2009; Hill 2009; Zhang et al. 2012a; Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2009; Chopra 2007) . This provides inability of microorganism to develop resistance against them. Recently few reports have elucidated a more efficient, direct contact killing action of silver nanoparticles to the bacterial cell wall, which do not even require the internalization of nanoparticles into the cells and thus would be more efficient than antibiotics to inhibit bacterial resistance. As a result, nanomaterials are particularly very effective to kill the multiple drug resistant microbial strains. In particular, the inherent antimicrobial properties of coinage metals i.e., silver, gold and copper were known to us from ancient times, these metallic nanoparticles have been utilized by researchers as potential disinfectants in biomedical and water purification applications (Atiyeh et al. 2007; Russell et al. 1994) . They are being introduced as one of the important component in our daily life style. Imagine an odorless textiles (antibacterial T shirts) to public hygiene (deodorants, toothbrushes, washing machines) to water purifier to processed foods packing material, to antibacterial bandages, sunscreen lotions, and cosmetics that you would certainly feel the existence of nanomaterials. More recently, silver nanoparticles are used in the coating of medical equipments such as catheters, infusion systems and dental composites.

However, the choice of the method to be employed for immobilization would certainly depend on many other factors such as type of solid support used, size/shape, morphology, surface functionalization and stability of nanoparticles, and the kind of application for which it is used. For example, a low-moderate level of immobilization may give the desired signals for optical/biosensor applications (Johnsson et al. 1991 ) while, a relatively higher level of immobilization would always be desired for the long term antibacterial effects. Moreover, in order to develop a antimicrobial biomaterial, the physical behavior of a biomaterial during nanomaterials integration must be in compliance with clinical requirements (Stickler 2000) . For example, the mechanical specifications of antimicrobial biomaterial would be desirable for a very high load as in case with hip and knee implants. On the other hand, a biomaterial should either have high transmittance for designing intraocular/contact lenses or should be highly elastic while fabricating artificial blood vessels.

In late eighteenth century, eye drops constituting of 2% silver nitrate solution were also used to thwart the ocular infections in newborns which lead to blindness and against the treatment of typhoid and anthrax. In 1920s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency has recognized colloidal silver as an effective agent to manage wound healing (Chopra 2007) . Silver was then continued as a promising strategy for controlling infections during burns till World War II, which outraged its role with huge demands and development of new antibiotics (Dunn and Edwards-Jones 2004) . However, such a heavy use of antibiotics lead to the development of drug resistant microbial strains which propelled the researchers to find novel remedies based on silver.

The antimicrobial property of AgNPs is governed by several other factors such as shape, aggregation state, stability, dispersion medium, types of capping agents, and methods of surface functionalization of nanoparticles.

Regarding shape, the truncated AgNPs appear to be more potent than spherical AgNPs in terms of their antimicrobial efficacies (Pal et al. 2007 ). However, spherical AgNPs are usually preferred over other shapes due to their ease in synthesis, control on particle size, handling and recovery for use either as colloidal state, or immobilized form (Agnihotri et al. 2013 (Agnihotri et al. , 2014 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 268, "text": "(Chen and Schluesener 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 269, "end": 284, "text": "Rai et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 680, "end": 703, "text": "(Agnihotri et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 704, "end": 725, "text": "Mukherji et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 726, "end": 748, "text": "Ruparelia et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 877, "end": 893, "text": "(Pal et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1119, "text": "(Agnihotri et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1144, "text": "(Agnihotri et al. , 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Regarding in vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of AgNPs, the potency is quantified either by using disk diffusion tests in solid media or by serially diluting the antibacterial material in liquid culture (Agnihotri et al. 2014; Ruparelia et al. 2008) . In disk diffusion studies, the sensitivity of a microbe is tested by calculating the diameter of zone of inhibition (ZoI) created by nanoparticles-laden disc by inhibiting the microbial growth surrounding that disc. Thus, a higher value of ZoI would indicate a more sensitive microbial strain and a more effective antimicrobial nanomaterial (Fig. 1) . On the other hand, the liquid broth assay is used to quantify the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of nanoparticles as shown in Table 1 . The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the minimum concentration of antimicrobial Studies were done at 10 5 -10 6 CFU ml \u22121 initial bacterial concentrations agent that inhibits the visible growth of microbes whereas, the lowest concentration of biocidal agent that kills 99.9% of microbial population is termed as minimum bactericidal concentration (Ruparelia et al. 2008) . The antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles strongly depends on synthesis routes by which they were produced. Out of several methods (physical, chemical and biological) explored for producing silver nanoparticles, biological methods are gaining enormous interest due to its eco-friendly, non-toxic nature and often synthesize AgNPs with higher antimicrobial properties than that of produced by any other means (Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2009 ). For instance Nanda and Saravanan (2009) investigated the antibacterial activity of biogenic AgNPs (160-180 nm) using S. aureus and found that these NPs showed excellent biocidal efficacy against clinically pathogenic multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug resistant Staphylococcus epidermis (MRSE), and S. pyogenes. Similarly, Ingle et al. (2008) reported the extracellular synthesis of AgNPs using Fusarium accuminatum, isolated from infected ginger and demonstrated nearly 2-3 times higher biocidal activity of AgNPs than bulk silver (Ag + ) against highly pathogenic bacterial strains i.e., MRSA, Salmonella typhi, S. epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. Results revealed that the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles is 2.4-2.9 times that of silver ions. In a recent study, AgNPs (average size, 19-54 nm) synthesized using whole plant extract and callus extract of Linum usitatissimum demonstrated good efficacy against pathogenic strains E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus (Anjum and Abbasi 2016) . Similarly, Shanthi et al. (2016) used cell free extract of Bacillus licheniformis to produce 18-64 nm AgNPs which exhibited strong antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dav1. Silver nanoparticles synthesized through green route have also demonstrated good antimycotic activity against various fungal species viz, Candida albicans, Dermatophyte Trichophyton and Mentagrophytes (Pan\u00e1\u010dek et al. 2009; Rodrigues et al. 2013) .

The successful immobilization of AgNPs was evidenced by observing a visual change in the color of nanocomposites after immobilization (Fig. 3) . Electron microscopy analyses confirmed a highly dense and homogenous distribution of AgNPs over the nanocomposite. The nanocomposite with high Ag content (0.57-4.4 wt%) exhibited strong antibacterial activity toward S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis strains. A modified form of cellulose i.e., carboxymethylcellulose has also been utilized as a template for incorporating copper, silver and even iron oxide nanoparticles with an aim to fabricate antimicrobial and antifungal coatings as novel therapeutics (Nadagouda and Varma 2007) .

The resulting nanocomposite was applied on cotton fabrics so as to testify its antimicrobial potential on clinical isolates. The modified cotton fabrics showed excellent antibacterial activity towards E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains. A slight reduction in the antibacterial efficacy of modified fabrics was observed when used repeatedly for 20 washing cycles, however 90% bacterial killing was still achievable with such high number of washing steps. Authors claimed this NC as a promising approach for fabricating antibacterial finishing for wound healing purposes.

Through gene expression data, it was evidenced that E. coli expressed a higher levels of stress-related gene products when treated with SWCNTs as compared to MWCNTs.

The polymerization process was continued up to 8 h at 35\u00b0C where silver ions were anchored at the surface of hydrogel through electrostatic interactions.

The antibacterial potential of hydrogel nanocomposite was evaluated on the basis of their degree of colonization on its surface after desired durations. Results showed that the density of P. aeruginosa colonization on pure PVA hydrogels was estimated to be in the range of 2.2-5.5 \u00c2 10 3 CFU cm \u22122 after 6 h of incubation whereas, no adherent bacterial colony was found on AgNP loaded PVA hydrogel for initial 6 h.

Owing to its poor solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, chitin polymer limits its practical applications and was widely accepted in the form of chitosan, which provided ample opportunities for further development (Dash et al. 2011) . Moreover, chitosan offers some extraordinary properties such as innate biocompatibility, biodegradability, intrinsic antimicrobial efficacy, bone forming capability, and wound healing knack difficult to achieve with any other natural or synthetic polymer, making it a promising biomaterial to be used in various biomedical applications (Dash et al. 2011) . With the shift of dimension from macro to nano, chitosan nanomaterials have also been shown to have expansive antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity (Rabea et al. 2003) , which depend upon several factors, including pH, degree of deacetylation, and the type of solvent (Tavaria et al. 2013; Chung et al. 2003) . Moreover, the average molecular weight is also an important parameter that signifies the solubility of chitosan in various solvents. In past two decades, chitosan has been proved to be a safer carrier for drug formulations (Felt et al. 1998) . A number of delivery vehicles based on colloidal chitosan have been recently cited for delivering drugs, peptides, proteins, vaccines, DNA and siRNA (Almeida and Souto 2007; Mao et al. 2010 ). Due to its excellent mucoadhesive nature to a variety of hard and soft tissues, chitosan based hybrid materials may serve as a temporary skeleton in bone tissue engineering (Ca\u00f1as et al. 2016) . Fortunately, most of the chitosan based formulations has not been reported to provoke either inflammatory responses or allergic consequence within human body which has established its wide acceptability and utilization as biocompatible implants, injection, oral ingestions, topical applications for diverse biomedical purposes. Chitosan films/membranes has been tested as an efficient biomaterial for wound healing applications (skins, burns) and coating implants, thanks to its innate antimicrobial nature which inhibits biofilm formation yet promoting cell (e.g., fibroblasts, keratinocytes) proliferation for epidermal regeneration (Bla\u017eevi\u0107 et al. 2016) . For example, Qi et al. (2004) synthesized chitosan and copper loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) based on ionic gelation interaction between positively charged chitosan and negatively charged tripolyphosphate molecules. The processing was operated at room temperature and copper ions were absorbed on to CSNPs via ion exchange resins and/or surface chelation respectively. The average size of pure CSNPs and Cu-loaded CSNPs was calculated as 40 and 257 nm, respectively through AFM. These NPs showed effective antibacterial activity than their pristine counterparts against E. coli, S. choleraesuis, S. typhimurium, and S. aureus with MIC values ranging between 0.01 and 0.13 \u00b5g ml \u22121 . AFM analyses revealed that CSNPs severely killed S. choleraesuis cells via membrane disruption such that membrane permeability was severely damaged resulting in the leakage of intracellular components. In another study, a synergistic antibacterial activity of Cu loaded CSNPs was observed against E. coli K88 strain with MIC (9 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ) and MBC values 21-42 folds lower than the individual antibacterial entities i.e., copper ions and chitosan nanoparticles (Du et al. 2008) . Therefore, it is anticipated that CSNPs often integrated with metallic nanoparticles can be used as potential antibacterial agents in biomedicine. Anitha et al. (2009) synthesized CSNPs (average size, 40-50 nm) and their water soluble derivatives i.e., O-carboxymethyl chitosan (O-CMC, 90-100 nm) and N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan (N,O-CMC, 80-85 nm) nanoparticles, to compare their antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus. They found that among modified NPs; N,O-CMC NPs showed maximum antibacterial efficiency than O-CMC and CSNPs, with 100% inhibition rate at a maximum concentration of 1 mg ml \u22121 . The greater antibacterial effect of N,O-CMC NPs was attributed to their relatively higher degree of substitution of carboxymethyl groups on chitosan than unmodified chitosan, (Sun et al. 2006) . Earlier, It was hypothesized that the introduction of carboxymethyl groups strengthen the overall positive charge on chitosan molecules, resulting in greater interaction with negatively charged components (lipopolysaccharides, proteins) present in the bacterial membrane, thereby causing membrane disruption and release of major content of intracellular material outside cells (Sudarshan et al. 1992) . Yien et al. (2012) evaluated the antifungal activity of CSNPs prepared from both low and high molecular weight chitosan against Candida albicans, Fusarium solani and Aspergillus niger species. Results showed a significant antimycotic activity with MIC values ranging from 0.6-1.0 and 0.5-1.2 mg ml \u22121 against C. albicans while 0.25-0.86 and 0.86-1.2 mg ml \u22121 against F. solani for high mol. wt. and low mol. wt. CSNPs, respectively. Among all the tested strains, A. niger appeared as the most resistant strain since there was an increase in MIC values by ten times (2-3 mg ml \u22121 ).

It was hypothesized that being polar in nature, both chitosan and CSNPs were able to diffuse slowly from films to agar plate, facilitating a direct contact killing action.

While most research focused on claiming antimicrobial potential of these nanomaterials have employed either the colloidal state or often conjugated with antibiotics/drugs, the hypotheses of using them as next generation antimicrobial agents has limited clinical relevance.

GNPs are appropriate to deliver drugs to cellular addresses due to their ease in fabrication, functionalization, biocompatibility and their ability to cross cellular barriers while interacting with cell surface lipids (Huang et al. 2009 ). On the other hand, antibacterial efficacies of GNPs can be increased by adding antibiotics (Grace and Pandian 2007; Rai et al. 2010 ) whereas on conjugating with target-specific biomolecules, GNPs can be used as powerful therapeutics to destroy even cancerous cells. Gu et al. (2003) synthesized vancomycin-conjugated GNPs exploiting the strong binding affinity of gold to thiol (-SH) groups such that the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin was significantly improved on coating with gold nanoparticles (5 nm) against vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) well as E. coli. These gold NP conjugates were more effective than vancomycin itself against various bacterial strains. Similar findings were presented in another study (Huang et al. 2007) where polygonal shaped GNPs after immobilizing vancomycin were used as an effective photothermal agents for the selective killing of VRE, MRSA, and other potentially drug-resistant microorganisms. Authors revealed that the dual functionalities of GNPs (to absorb near-infrared radiations) and vancomycin (binding with the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala moieties of the peptide units of bacterial cell wall) contributed towards its photothermal destruction with high efficiency without eliciting any toxic effects on human cells. Rosemary et al. (2006) also demonstrated that ciprofloxacin-encapsulated gold-silica nanoshells mediated enhanced antibacterial activity as compared to free ciprofloxacin against E. coli DH5. The ability of Cefaclor, a second-generation antibiotic for synthesizing GNPs showed potent antimicrobial activities on both Gram positive S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria E. coli strains (Rai et al. 2010) . As compared to individual components, GNPs-antibiotic conjugate facilitated more severe perforations in bacterial cell wall followed by disrupting the bacterial DNA leading to cell death. Demurtas and Perry (2014) created a proficient drug delivery/carrier system by conjugating stable GNPs with antibiotic amoxicillin (a member of the penicillin family) which also reduced the chloroauric acid to form nanoparticles (30-40 nm) and simultaneously coated them to afford the functionalized nanomaterial. Figure 12 shows the comparative antibacterial performances of pure amoxicillin, pure GNPs and amox-GNPs conjugates with various proportions over duration of 4 h. Results indicate that amoxicillin-conjugated GNPs showed an enhancement in antibacterial potency against E. coli as compared to the antibiotics and GNPs alone.

Moreover, there is a daunting concern about the reoccurrence of drug-resistant microorganisms in infection prone areas such as hospitals, where the development of new antimicrobial materials for therapeutics, antisepsis or disinfection purposes are anticipating new strategies for employing them under clinically relevant conditions. In this context, nanotechnology is playing major role in some high priorities areas such as biomedical implants, surgical devices, catheters, stents, and antimicrobial coatings where the application of nano-antimicrobials based on metallic nanoparticles (silver, gold, copper/copper oxide), zinc oxide, chitosan nanoparticles along with their hybrid nanocomposites have been evaluated at various parameters such as their broad spectrum antimicrobial nature, efficacy, reusability and potential cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Each nanomaterial has shown its advantages and limitations therefore, accepting an ideal strategy or procedure for developing the antimicrobial biomaterials is not feasible. However, in future the involvement of \"translational research\" for making nano-antimicrobial biomaterials needs to be urgently constructed so as to implement the actual transformation of laboratory
