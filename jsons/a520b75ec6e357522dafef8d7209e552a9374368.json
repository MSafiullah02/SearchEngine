            "text": "A common approach to hazard identification based on epidemiological data is to fit a regression model to data on estimated exposure levels and response rates (e.g., average numbers of mortalities or morbidities per person-year) and to test the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient relating exposure to response rate is 0. Rejection of this null hypothesis supports weight-of-evidence (WoE) determinations of a causal relationship between exposure and response, especially if plausible confounders have been controlled for by including them as predictor in the regression model. (Similarly for risk ratios, confident rejection of the null hypothesis that a risk ratio is 1 (no difference) in risk between more-exposed and less-exposed people in statistical analyses of relative risks, standardized mortality ratios, odds ratios in logistic regression models, or hazard ratios in Cox proportional hazards regression models, is usually interpreted as evidence supporting a causal relationship in weight-ofevidence (WoE) determinations, especially if chance, confounding, and biases have been ruled out as plausible explanations.) Against this practice is a fundamental objection that regression models quantify associations rather than causal impacts. Specifically, they quantify the conditional expected (average) value of the dependent variable, given the observed values of predictors, but this is different from for the same total amount delivered (e.g., for the same ppm-hours per week). This implies that curve 3 can activate responses that curve 1 would not.

Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This paper reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. Statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. If so, the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. We discuss statistical options for controlling for such threats, and advocate causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models as potentially valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. We conclude that these approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.",

Nonlinearities in interactions of the agent with other factors (such as co-exposures, co-morbidities, or covariates that modify the agent's effect) and dependencies among these factors, complicate the interpretation and estimation of slope factors or of entire concentration-response (C-R) curves that seek to quantify how a health endpoint depends on exposure. At a minimum, it becomes necessary to specify what is assumed about the levels of other factors, and about how (if at all) they change when exposure is changed -for example, how changing one component of a mix of pollutants changes other components that affect the same health endpoint. More generally, in both linear and nonlinear models, failing to characterize causal pathways other than those leading directly from the agent to the effect, such as indirect (mediated) pathways, or exposure-response associations due to common causes (e.g., confounders) or to common effects (e.g., sample selection criteria), can make it difficult or impossible to determine how changing exposure would change response probabilities.

They require new ways to carry out each of the health risk assessment steps of hazard identification, dose-response modeling, exposure assessment, risk characterization, and uncertainty characterization. They also have strong implications for how to communicate risk accurately, and for how to manage risk effectively. This paper reviews challenges for risk analysis posed by nonlinearity, and discusses constructive methods to meet these challenges using current techniques of data science and causal analytics. It focuses on techniques for using epidemiological data -typically, exposure, response, and covariate variables measured in a population over time -to identify and quantify health risks caused by exposures when underlying individual-level causal biological C-R functions are nonlinear. As an organizing framework, we take the practice of regulatory occupational risk assessment recently described by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH 2020), which we consider a clear, thoughtful exposition of key principles and practices of current regulatory risk assessment.

This can happen for many reasons, even if the predicted variable does not depend on exposure. Perhaps the best known reason is that a confounder -a variable that makes both exposure and the response more likely when it is present (or, more generally, that shifts both their cumulative distribution functions rightward) -can induce a positive regression coefficient for exposure in a regression model that includes exposure but not the confounder. For example, suppose that cigarette smoking, exposure indicators such as blood concentrations of heavy metals (e.g., lead or cadmium), and response indicators such as age-specific mortality or morbidity are all mutually positively correlated in a data set. Then a regression model that omitted smoking could show positive regression coefficients for the exposure indicators, whether or not response risk depends directly on them, if they also act as surrogates for smoking, which directly affects risk. In this case, smoking would be a confounder for the estimated exposure-response association. In current practice, it is perhaps unlikely that such an obvious confounder would be omitted, unless the data were unavailable. However, fully controlling for effects of confounders can be surprisingly difficult, especially when linear models cannot be assumed.",

However, this tactic often fails to fully control for effects of confounding, for reasons discussed in the following sections on measurement errors, model specification errors, residual confounding, surrogate variables, variable selection, competing explanations, and attribution of joint effects. For example, indicators of smoking such as self-reported pack years and cotinine levels, are often imperfectly accurate (Hsieh et al. 2011) . Residual effect of confounding might then still contribute to a positive regression coefficient for exposure. Even more challenging is the problem of omitted confounders (also called latent confounders or unobserved confounders) -that is, confounders that are not included in a regression model, perhaps because they were not measured. A useful current practice is to quantify how strong the effects of omitted confounders on exposure and risk would have to be to explain away the estimated effect of exposure on response. If the required effect sizes are much larger than those for measured confounders, then this suggests that any omitted confounder(s) would have to be stronger than the measured ones to provide a plausible alternative explanation for the estimated exposure-response association.",

As a simple hypothetical illustrative example to clarify concepts, suppose that, unbeknownst to the risk modeler, the true relationship between a measure of health risk, R, and past pack-years of smoking, S, is the LNT structural equation R = 0.01*S; and that an exposure variable X (such as concentration of a metal in blood or urine) is also related to S by the equation X = 0.02*S 1/2 ; thus, S confounds the association between X and R. Consider the effect on multiple linear regression if the estimated values of S and X values are unbiased but have uniformly distributed estimation errors. Specifically, suppose that estimated values are uniformly distributed between zero and twice their corresponding true values. Fitting the regression model E(R | S, X) = b 0 + b S S + b X X to a simulated data set with 1000 cases having S values independently uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 yields the estimated regression model E(R | S, X) = 0.002 + 0.0035*S + 0.094*X. The intercept and both regression coefficents are significantly greater than 0 (p < 0.00001). By contrast, the correct causal relationship with accurately measured variables would be E(R | S, X) = 0.01*S (or, 0.01*S + 0*X). Thus, measurement error has induced a significant positive exposure coefficient (b X = 0.094) for X, even though the regression model included the confounder S on its right side. Intuitively, the reason is that measurements of X provide useful information for reducing the mean squared prediction error when R is predicted from S alone, because of the measurement error in S.

This is the problem of model specification error or model misspecification: the specified model form does not perfectly describe the data. As a simple hypothetical example, if R = S 3 and X = S 2 , where S is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, then fitting the (incorrectly specified) multiple linear model E(R | S, X) = b 0 + b S S + b X X to a simulated data set of size N = 1000 cases produces a least-squares fit of E(R | S, X) = 0.05 + 1.5*X -0.60*S, with an R 2 value of 0.99 and all coefficients and the intercept significantly different from zero (p < 0.00001). Although R depends only on the confounder S and not on exposure X, controlling for S by including it on the right side of the regression model does not fully control for its confounding effects, or preclude a statistically significant positive regression coefficient for X. Intuitively, the reason is that the shape of the assumed model (in this case, linear) is not correct, and including X and well as S helps to reduce prediction errors due to model specification error. However, although conditioning on X as well as S leads to an excellent fit as assessed by the R 2 value of 0.99, neither this high R 2 nor the small p value of the regression coefficient for X indicates that risk depends on X as well as on S. Analogous examples arise for dichotomous outcomes such as mortality. If R = 1 whenever S > 0.5, with S uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and R is otherwise 0; and if X is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 if S > 0.5, and is otherwise 0 (e.g., if X is an exposure marker that is only formed when S > 0.5), then the regression coefficient for X will be significantly positive (and larger than that for S) in a logistic regression model for R with X and S as predictors, even though R does not depend on X.",

A practical illustration concerns hazard identification of the metal molybdenum (Mo) as a hazard that might cause decreased testosterone (T) in men. For example, Lewis and Meeker (2015) presented a multiple linear regression of the dependent variable log(T) against the predictors log(Mo), BMI (body mass index), and others, in order to estimate the statistical effect of log(Mo) on log(T) while controlling for potential confounding by BMI. (For simplicity, we focus on these three variables; the full model also included age and other potential confounders.) The multiple linear regression model showed statistically significant negative regression coefficients for both log(Mo) and BMI, i.e., greater values of each are associated with smaller values of T (and log(T)), given the value of the other. This led to the tentative identification of Mo as a reproductive hazard. As the authors state, \"In adjusted analyses where metals were modeled as a continuous variable, we found significant inverse associations between urinary molybdenum and serum copper and serum testosterone. \u2026These findings add to the limited human evidence that exposure to molybdenum and other metals is associated with altered testosterone in men, which may have important implications for male health.\" Accounting for nonlinearity changes this conclusion. Figure 1 shows scatter plots of log(T) (upper, blue scatter plot) and log(Mo) (lower, red scatter plot) against BMI in kg/m 2 with linear regression lines and nonparametric (smoothing) regression curves superimposed on the data so that departures from linearity can be seen easily. (The data are for men aged 18-55 from the National Health (Analogously, if Y = Z 2 and X = Z 0.5 , where Z is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2, then a multiple linear regression model for predicting Y from both X and Z has a lower prediction error (MSE) than one for predicting Y from Z alone, even though only Z and not X determines the value of Y.) Restricting the range of BMI values considered to the interval from 25 to 35, where the linear and nonparametric regression models nearly coincide, makes log(Mo) no longer a significant predictor of log(T) in the linear multiple regression model, suggesting that fully controlling for confounding by BMI eliminates the association between log(Mo) and log(T). A significant regression coefficient that does not reflect a causal relationship, or that is eliminated by fully controlling for confounding, does not provide a sound basis for causal inference for hazard identification.",

For example, a variable such as \"smoking status\" with possible values of current, former, or never (or, even more simply, a binary value such as 1 for \"has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life\" and 0 otherwise) might be used to \"adjust\" for smoking. Yet, such a summary variable leaves much quantitative information about smoking intensity and duration unaccounted for. Likewise, a regression model which adjusts for age by including a binary indicator such as 1 for over 65 years old, else 0, by including 5-year or 10-year age categories, leaves more detailed information about age unrepresented. Such omitted information about a confounder may induce a positive regression coefficient for exposure, even if risk does not depend on exposure; this is the problem of residual confounding. For example, if Risk = (Age/100) 2 for 0 < Age < 100 years; Exposure = Age; and the correctly specified regression model E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = b 0 + b X *Exposure + b A *Age 2 is fit to 1000 randomly generated cases with age uniformly distributed between 0 and 100, then, in the absence of measurement error and sampling error, the result is as expected: E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = (age/100) 2 . However, if age is rounded to the nearest decade, then fitting the same model yields E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = -0.03+ 0.002*Exposure + 0.00008*Age 2 . The intercept and both regression coefficients are statistically significantly different from 0 (p < 0.000001), even though risk depends only on Age and not on Exposure.

For example, a recent study of the association between blood lead level (BLL) and age-specific mortality rate (Lanphear et al. 2018 ) used 3 categories for body mass index (BMI); 3 for self-reported smoking status (never, former, current); 2 for cotinine in blood serum (above or below 10 ng/mL); 2 for alcohol consumption; 3 for physical activity; 3 for cadmium; 2 for household income; 2 for hypertension; and 3 for a healthy eating index that runs from 1 to 100. Similarly, a regression analysis of the negative association between molybdenum (Mo) and testosterone (T) (Lewis and Meeker 2015) used 2 categories for BMI (below 25 kg/m 2 or not); 3 for income; and 2 for smoking. In such studies, the use of only a few categories for each of many potential confounders leaves unclear the extent to which reported exposure-response associations reflect residual confounding. For example, Figure 1 shows that BMI is associated with Mo and T both above and below 25 kg/m 2 , so use of a dichotomous BMI variable leaves this remaining (residual) confounding unaccounted for. The possibility of residual confounding does not necessarily imply that qualitative conclusions about exposure-response associations would change if residual confounding were better controlled, but it leaves open the question of how much they would change. To avoid this unnecessary uncertainty, it suffices to treat continuous variables as continuous, rather than artificially dichotomizing or categorizing them (Streiner 2002; Naggara et al. 2011) .",

Similarly, including county population density (average people per square mile) in a regression model for effects of PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality risk to control for the possibility that more densely populated areas might have both higher PM2.5 pollution levels and higher COVID-19 mortality risk does not fully eliminate this source of potential confounding if local population densities differ from the county average.",

If poor health is a predictor of increased risk for some diseases (e.g., cancers or heart diseases) in old age, then retired workers with the high cumulative exposures will be more likely to develop such diseases because of underlying poor health, even if exposure has no causal impact on health. Another example of a non-causal explanation that does not involve underlying health status would be if workers stay in a certain occupation only if they are poor or have low exposures (or both). If poverty causes increased health risks but exposure has no direct causal effect on health risks, then a study of workers who have stayed in the occupation may find that those with low exposures are less likely to be poor (since low exposures provide an alternative explanation for the choice to stay) and hence have lower average health risks. If poverty is not measured, but exposure and health effects are, there will be a positive association between exposure and risk (mediated by the unmeasured variable poverty), even if exposure does not affect risk.

Then a generalized linear regression model, such as logistic regression, will assign significantly positive regression coefficients to each of the three exposures if there are a large enough number of observations (each consisting of values of A, B, and C for an individual). This remains true even if the data are modified to set A = 0 whenever B + C < 15 (e.g., if pollutant A is formed only by sufficiently high levels of pollutants B and C). Yet, in this case, A makes no contribution to risk. Whether a disease occurs depends only on the values of B and C. Thus, regression can create a significant positive regression coefficients for an exposure as a predictor of risk by (mis)attributing part of the joint effect of multiple variables to it, even if has no causal impact on risk. (Special techniques that deal more consistently with attribution of risk in the presence of joint causes, such as Shapley regression, avoid this problem, but are seldom used in regulatory risk assessment.) Finally, if the distribution of either B or C (or both) is changed to a bimodal distribution that is equally likely to be 0 or 20, then the regression coefficient for A becomes zero (or, rather, is not significantly different from 0 in large data sets). Thus, whether regression analysis provides evidence that A has a significant positive regression coefficient depends on the distributions of other variables, rather than only on the causal biological effect (if any) of A itself. Hazard identification based on whether a regression coefficient is significantly different from zero may therefore be misleading when multiple risk factors interact in contributing to disease causation.",

Such techniques avoid the risk of overfitting inherent in many parametric models with (e.g., high-order polynomial regression models) by fitting simple low-order models to data in the neighborhood of each point of estimation (NIST 2013) . For large data sets with many potential predictors, there are many alternatives to regression modeling; here we mention some of them, deferring to a large technical literature and recent surveys and references therein) for details. Non-parametric alternatives to regression for predicting risk from exposure and other variables include classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, which seeks to partition records into subsets with significantly different values of the dependent variable by conditioning on values (or ranges of values) of predictors; and random forest model ensembles that estimate partial dependence plots (PDPs). A PDP shows how the average predicted value of the dependent variable (e.g., risk) changes as an explanatory variable of interest (e.g., exposure) is varied over its range, holding the values all other variables fixed at their observed levels in the data set.

The full methodology for BN learning and inference from data is quite detailed; we refer the reader to Nagarajan et al. (2013) and for details. An arrow joins two variables in a BN if they are found to be dependent (i.e., mutually informative about each other, so that the null hypothesis of conditional independence -that the conditional probability distribution for one is the same for all values of the other -can be confidently rejected, e.g., using nonparametric tests for independence; see Nagarajan et al. 2013 ). If effects depend on their direct causes, then a BN provides evidence that X might be a direct cause of Y if and only if they are linked by an arrow.

Such a BN shows that exposure is a hazard, i.e., a potential direct cause of risk, if and only if exposure and risk are joined by an arrow. (The specific set of other variables that should be conditioned on -including confounders or common causes, but not common effects, of exposure and risk -to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of exposure on risk constitutes what is called an adjustment set. Adjustment sets can be calculated from BNs by modern causal analysis algorithms . This solves the problem of variable selection that often bedevils regression modeling. It does so by identifying minimal sufficient subsets of variables -the \"adjustment sets\" -to condition on, i.e., to include in a (perhaps nonparametric) regression model, to estimate direct and total effects of one variable on another while avoiding biases created by failure to condition on common ancestors, or by conditioning on common descendants (Textor et al 2015) .) Some causal analysis algorithms attempt to orient the arrows between variables in a BN to reflect the flow of causality (and information) between variables, but even without such orientation of arrows, the structure of a BN is useful for hazard identification insofar as it shows whether risk is found to depend on exposure after adjusting for other variables.",

The conditional probability distribution of each variable (node in the network) depends on the values of the variables that point into it. This BN was constructed manually based on a detailed literature review of candidate markers and outcomes and predictive relationships among them, given limitations in measurement techniques (Hack et al. 2010) . The right side of Figure 2 shows random samples drawn (via Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis) from the BN-predicted dose-response function describing the conditional probability for AML given air benzene exposure concentrations. These curves are constructed from the conditional probability tables of the BN, as follows. Each value for benzene concentration (ppm) in inhaled air determines a conditional probability distribution for the benzene metabolite urinary tt-MA (trans-trans muconic acid). The value of tt-MA, in turn, determines a conditional probability distribution for 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress in lymphocytes. Finally, the value of 8-OHdG determines a conditional probability for AML. For each benzene concentration, a value of tt-MA is sampled from the conditional distribution of tt-MA, given the ppm of benzene; then a value for 8-OHdG is drawn from its conditional distribution given the sampled value of tt-MA; and finally this value is used to determine the conditional probability for AML given the sampled value of 8-OHdG. The needed conditional probabilities constitute the quantitative part of the BN model; they are estimated from data collected in multiple studies. Repeating this Monte Carlo sampling many times and averaging the results yields an estimate of the dose-response curve giving the conditional probability of AML for each value of air benzene concentration. Other potentially causally relevant variables (e.g., p-benzoquinone, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, age of patient, co-exposures and co-morbidities, and so forth) are \"marginalized out\" of the BN model in Figure 2 , meaning that they can still implicitly affect the probability of leukemia, but are not explicitly shown or conditioned on in calculating the sample dose-response curves for conditional probability of AML given ppm of benzene, shown on the right side of the diagram.

But much remains to be done to achieve this goal. Despite impressive recent technical progress, current BN-learning algorithms remain limited by their lack of common sense. (They are typically better at determining whether variables are conditionally independent than at identifying the directions of dependences between them, and may require human users to specify constraints such as that death is a possible effect but not a possible cause of other variables, or that sex, age, and ethnicity are possible causes but not possible effects of other variables.) They are prone to identify false-positive links between variables if confounders are omitted, or if discretization of continuous variables to form CPTs (e.g., using deciles of continuous variables as levels, or using CART trees) leaves substantial residual confounding. Validation that CPTs express stable causal relationships that hold across situations typically requires collecting data from multiple studies. Recent advances in theory and software for causal analysis and interpretation (e.g., the InvariantCausalPrediction and CompareCausalNetworks R packages) have started to address these and other challenges, including detecting and modeling hidden (latent, unobserved) variables based on otherwise unexplained correlations between observed variables), but these developments have as yet had little impact on regulatory risk assessment.",

Figure 3 is a notional diagram, without specific units on its axes, showing typical time patterns for how the internal dose (e.g., concentration of a toxic metabolite in a target organ or tissue) on the vertical axis varies over time (on the horizontal axis) for three different time patterns of dose administration (curves 1, 2, and 3). For an inhalation hazard, the administered dose rate corresponds to concentration of a substance in air. Curve 1 administers a certain concentration for a certain duration in each cycle of a repeated exposure pattern; curve 2 administers twice the concentration for half the duration; and curve 3 administers 3 times the concentration for 1/3 the duration, in each consecutive cycle. The vertical axis shows how concentration in a typical compartment varies with these time patterns of exposure. Specific versions of such model-predicted curves have been developed and validated for many chemicals using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. For purposes of dose-response modeling, an important feature is that administering higher concentrations for shorter durations produces higher peak internal concentrations than lower concentrations for longer durations, are more dangerous than administering the same average amounts per unit time more gradually. Figure 4 illustrates the effects of such nonlinearity, motivated by a model for accumulation of asbestos fibers in lung and mesothelial tissue . The vertical axis represents the amount of internal dose (e.g., fibers) added to a target tissue per unit time for different administered concentrations in air (horizontal axis), assuming sustained exposure to a constant concentration. The axes are scaled so that 1 on the horizontal axis represents the base case exposure scenario, e.g., what a typical worker might receive. The vertical axis shows the increase in cumulative internal dose (e.g., fibers lodged in target tissues) per unit time, and the curve plots this for different levels of administered concentration on the horizontal axis. Doubling exposure concentration from 1 to 2 increases the rate at which cumulative internal dose increases from about 1 to about 14, reflecting slower clearance from the lungs (e.g., via macrophages and the mucociliary escalator) and hence a higher fraction of inhaled dose (fibers) translocating to target tissues. By contrast, doubling exposure concentration from 0.1 to 0.2 makes relatively little difference, as most of the administered dose is cleared at such low concentrations. Similar reasoning sheds light on the question of whether a worker suffers greater risk if exposed to a hazardous substance on two consecutive days each week (e.g., Monday and Tuesday) or on two days separated by a longer recovery interval (e.g., Monday and Friday). If the first day's exposure reduces clearance (or depletes protective resources such as antioxidant pools), then another exposure on the next day may create a greater internal dose than it would if it instead occurred a few days later, when clearance capacity has recovered. If so, then exposures on consecutive days in each cycle (e.g., in a work week) will produce more internal dose than the same exposures administered with longer recovery periods in between. The timing of internal doses can also interact with response dynamics, e.g., by delaying cell division during and following a first exposure until internal doses decline enough for mitosis to proceed safely; if the cells thus synchronized and undergoing mitosis at approximately the same time, receive a second dose part way through it, the cytotoxic effect may be far larger than if the second dose had occurred earlier or later. These examples reinforce the key point that timing matters: for many substances, the same average cumulative exposure per unit time can have very different effects on risk of adverse response, depending on how it is distributed over time.",

When response thresholds or other nonlinearities in dose-response functions are important, accurate risk prediction may require more detailed descriptions of exposure histories than are captured in the exposure metrics used in regression-based risk modeling.

Computational Bayesian methods infer the shape of the exposure-response function by treating the true exposure as an unobserved quantity on which the estimated exposure depends.

A different possible explanation is that causally ineffective reductions in exposures do not reduce the risks attributed to them as originally predicted by regression models (e.g., because imperfectly controlled confounding or nonlinearities or interactions created regression coefficients that do not represent the causal effect on risk per unit reduction in exposure). Attributing undiminished risk to substantially lowered exposures increases the regression coefficient linking exposure to risk. This can create the appearance of higher risk-per-unit-exposure at lower concentrations (supralinearity) simply because the exposure-risk association attributes risk to exposures that do not cause it. Figure 5 illustrates some of these points. It fits three univariate models -linear, quadratic, and nonparametric smoothing regression curves -to data on blood lead concentration levels (x axis) and mortality during follow-up for nonsmokers in the NHANES data set. (Logistic regression would also seem appropriate a priori, but does not fit the data well, as the conditional expected value of the mortality rate is not a sigmoid function of concentration.) The data are used only to illustrate some conceptual and methodological points, so we forego discussion of details of the data set (or of alternative regression models, such as proportional hazards, that would better address survival data); the full data set can be downloaded from [URL TO BE ADDED HERE]. The linear and quadratic models have 95% confidence bands (shown as dashed curves). The nonparametric regression curve is approximately flat at the right edge of the plot, where the linear model slopes up and the quadratic model slopes down. Although model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit tests can help select the best-fitting parametric model (e.g., quadratic rather than linear), they do not fix the fact that even the best-fitting model in a parametric class of models may not fit the data very well. Confidence bands do not communicate this aspect of model uncertainty: the confidence intervals in Figure 5 are narrow compared to the range of predictions from different models. For this reason, sensitivity analysis (discussed later) is often used to assess the extent to which predictions from different models differ (NIOSH 2020) . This leaves open the question of how to reconcile (or select or combine) risk predictions from different models, as well as the question of whether any of the different models considered makes accurate predictions.",

For example, if the strong positive association between BLL and mortality risk were entirely explained by incompletely controlled confounding by age (i.e., older people having higher BLL and higher mortality probabilities, with a nonlinear increase in mortality risk at older ages (and higher BLL levels) that is not entirely corrected for including age as a predictor in a regression model), then the models in Figure 5 would have no implications for how much or whether reducing lead concentrations would reduce risk. That statistical risk models do not necessarily describe how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk, even if they fit observed data well and have tight confidence limits, is well understood by many epidemiologists. It is not always as clear to risk managers and regulatory risk assessors, many of whom seek to use quantitative estimates of low-dose risk obtained from regressionbased dose-response models to inform decisions about how to limit exposures in order to protect health (NIOSH 2020), without understanding that regression-based dose-response (or exposure-response) curves are usually not appropriate for this purpose because they do not reveal how changing exposures would change risks (Pearl 2009 ). Risk and uncertainty characterization and communication of risk assessment results to decision-makers should clarify such uncertainty about consequences of interventions in order to inform rational and effective decision-making. More constructively, presenting results from validated causal Bayesian network risk models (Pearl 2009; Hack et al. 2010; and dynamic simulation risk models can show how interventions, such as reducing exposure, are predicted to change the probability distributions of outcomes such as disease and mortality risks.",

            "text": "Regulatory risk assessment has long embraced three principles that help to explain why LNT assumptions are often used in practice, despite reservations about possible nonlinearity such as those described in previous sections (e.g., Crump 2017; Rhomberg, Goodman et al. 2011 ). The first is an assumption that incremental cancer risks from exposures to chemicals (and radiation) add to background processes, leading to effective linearity of the exposure-related dose-response or C-R curves. The second is that population heterogeneity tends to linearize population C-R functions, even if individual-level ones have thresholds or other nonlinearities. The third is that statistical upper confidence limits on LNT functions are appropriately conservative or health-protective in the face of uncertainty about the true C-R functions. All three principles have been debated for years. However, some recent examinations of the additivity-to-background assumption have concluded that it is often unjustified on both mathematical and biological grounds, in part because mechanisms of exposurerelated harm, such as activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, differ from mechanisms of background (spontaneous) harm in many cases, leading to genuine thresholds or threshold-like nonlinearities for incremental risks caused by exposures . Likewise, careful explication of the population heterogeneity argument has concluded that it broadens C-R uncertainty bands, but does not linearize nonlinear functions and should not be construed as implying linear upper confidence limits at low exposure concentrations (Rhomberg, Goodman et al. 2011; . Specifically, if thresholds or sharp nonlinearities hold for individuals, a combination of uncertainty and variability in C-R functions, together with exposure estimation error, may create a range of values at the population level over which estimated population risk decreases gradually with decreasing exposure concentrations, but this does not in general imply that linear extrapolation down to zero is justified, even if it deemed prudent to use upper uncertainty limits . As illustrated on the right side of Figure 2 , Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis can lead to wide uncertainty bands that are nonetheless nonlinear. We conclude that, in general, nonlinear models deserve careful uncertainty analysis, and that simplifying LNT assumptions are not necessarily well justified even if there are positive background rates, population heterogeneity, and a desire to be conservative by using upper uncertainty distribution quantiles for purposes of regulation. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis provides a constructive approach for characterizing uncertainty in nonlinear models, including Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models, if enough is known to model uncertain quantities as random variables.",

Risk assessors identify and characterize these judgements by conducting additional analyses to test plausible alternative assumptions, examine the robustness of main analyses, and improve transparency in the risk assessment process. These alternative analyses comprise sensitivity and modeling uncertainty analyses. NIOSH defines sensitivity analysis as a study of the uncertainty in estimates from the mathematical model that can be apportioned to uncertainties in its inputs.\" Sensitivity analyses inform decision-makers about how predictions depend on uncertain modeling assumptions, for example, by showing the different risk predictions made by different models (e.g., the linear and quadratic models in Figure 5 ). However, they do not identify whether any of the alternatives is close to the truth. Moreover, they are limited to studying how changes in assumed inputs affect outputs, but they do not address uncertainty about what the outputs mean, such as whether estimated C-R functions reflect association or causation (or both).",

Using statistical techniques and algorithms usually outperforms expert judgment, in a variety of domains (Tetlock and Gardner 2015) . Moreover, the previous sections have illustrated that the specific technical challenges arising in risk assessment can be quite subtle and challenging, making it difficult to see how scientific judgment alone can address them usefully. Scientific judgment used in lieu of available statistical techniques and algorithms might be hard pressed to yield useful assessments and corrections for residual confounding due to slight departures from linearity ( Figure 1 ); or to reliably assess whether a repeated exposure will produce internal doses that exceed a threshold ( Figure 3 ); or to adjust correctly for nonlinearities in extrapolating from high to low exposure concentrations ( Figure 4 ); or to predict how correcting for exposure measurement errors and for variance and autocorrelations in exposure time series would change the shapes of estimated C-R functions; or to estimate the results of averaging the risk predictions from an ensemble of models while varying exposure and holding other variables fixed, as in a partial dependence plot. These are not types of tasks that judgment excels at. Scientific judgments about causality are notoriously error-prone (Kahneman 2011) , and C-R regression curves and confidence intervals do not offer even the most discerning judgment the empirical information needed to determine how or whether changing exposure would change risk (Figure 5, Pearl 2009 ). Judgments organized, tested, and validated using causal Bayesian network appear to be promising for addressing causal questions (Pearl 2009 ) and for quantifying causal C-R functions ( Figure 2 ). However, testing and validating such models with data makes heavy use of statistical methods and algorithms (such as conditional independence tests, calculation of adjustment sets, estimation of conditional probability tables of functions, and inference of causal exposure-response relations controlling for the variables in adjustment sets) ).",

Thus, the practical design of regulations that better protect worker health by addressing these aspects of exposure appears to be a worthwhile topic for further (Table 1) . Wellspecified regression models can be highly useful for estimating conditional probability and conditional expected value relationships between a variable and its direct causes, if these are known and suitable adjustment sets have been identified. However, regression per se does not address the causal interpretation of the C-R curves that it produces (Pearl 2009 ). Judgment is not usually a viable substitute for more formal analytic methods (Kahneman 2011; Tetlock and Gardner 2015) ; conversely, even the best current formal analytic methods cannot replace the scientific judgment and knowledge needed to create dynamic simulation models and other detailed causal models of complex biological processes. Even strong and statistically significant associations observed in well-designed and controlled health impact assessment studies do not necessarily translate into valid causal relationships between the studied variables.

In (also briefly) points out alternative analytical methods that can help to identify and address the difficulties identified, and it advocates their use.

To me, this is what a successful review process is all about. Thank you for the effort to really engage with this material and to make clear to me where I had failed to connect the dots, and I think the paper is much better because of it! 1. Changed the title to \"Implications of Nonlinearity, Confounding, and Interactions for Estimating Exposure Concentration-Response Functions in Quantitative Risk Analysis\" 2. Added the following to the Introduction: \"Nonlinearity in an agent's causation of a health endpoint implies that no single slope coefficient necessarily characterizes the change in risk from a given change in exposure. Nonlinearities in interactions of the agent with other factors (such as co-exposures, co-morbidities, or covariates that modify the agent's effect) and dependencies among these factors, complicate the interpretation and estimation of slope factors or of entire concentration-response (C-R) curves that seek to quantify how a health endpoint depends on exposure. At a minimum, it becomes necessary to specify what is assumed about the levels of other factors, and about how (if at all) they change when exposure is changed -for example, how changing one component of a mix of pollutants changes other components that affect the same health endpoint. More generally, in both linear and nonlinear models, failing to characterize causal pathways other than those leading directly from the agent to the effect, such as indirect (mediated) pathways, or exposure-response associations due to common causes (e.g., confounders) or to common effects (e.g., sample selection criteria), can make it difficult or impossible to determine how changing exposure would change response probabilities. The possibility of nonlinearity exacerbates C-R estimation problems if high-order interactions among factors must be considered, and no small number of parameters in a simple model form can be assumed to adequately represent the data-generating process.\"",

This can happen for many reasons, even if the predicted variable does not depend on exposure. Perhaps the best known reason is that a confounder -a variable that makes both exposure and the response more likely when it is present (or, more generally, that shifts both their cumulative distribution functions rightward) -can induce a positive regression coefficient for exposure in a regression model that includes exposure but not the confounder. For example, suppose that cigarette smoking, exposure indicators such as blood concentrations of heavy metals (e.g., lead or cadmium), and response indicators such as age-specific mortality or morbidity are all mutually positively correlated in a data set. Then a regression model that omitted smoking could show positive regression coefficients for the exposure indicators, whether or not response risk depends directly on them, if they also act as surrogates for smoking, which directly affects risk. In this case, smoking would be a confounder for the estimated exposure-response association. In current practice, it is perhaps unlikely that such an obvious confounder would be omitted, unless the data were unavailable. However, fully controlling for effects of confounders can be surprisingly difficult, especially when linear models cannot be assumed.",

However, this tactic often fails to fully control for effects of confounding, for reasons discussed in the following sections on measurement errors, model specification errors, residual confounding, surrogate variables, variable selection, competing explanations, and attribution of joint effects. For example, indicators of smoking such as self-reported pack years and cotinine levels, are often imperfectly accurate (Hsieh et al. 2011) . Residual effect of confounding might then still contribute to a positive regression coefficient for exposure. Even more challenging is the problem of omitted confounders (also called latent confounders or unobserved confounders) -that is, confounders that are not included in a regression model, perhaps because they were not measured. A useful current practice is to quantify how strong the effects of omitted confounders on exposure and risk would have to be to explain away the estimated effect of exposure on response. If the required effect sizes are much larger than those for measured confounders, then this suggests that any omitted confounder(s) would have to be stronger than the measured ones to provide a plausible alternative explanation for the estimated exposure-response association.",

As a simple hypothetical illustrative example to clarify concepts, suppose that, unbeknownst to the risk modeler, the true relationship between a measure of health risk, R, and past pack-years of smoking, S, is the LNT structural equation R = 0.01*S; and that an exposure variable X (such as concentration of a metal in blood or urine) is also related to S by the equation X = 0.02*S 1/2 ; thus, S confounds the association between X and R. Consider the effect on multiple linear regression if the estimated values of S and X values are unbiased but have uniformly distributed estimation errors. Specifically, suppose that estimated values are uniformly distributed between zero and twice their corresponding true values. Fitting the regression model E(R | S, X) = b 0 + b S S + b X X to a simulated data set with 1000 cases having S values independently uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 yields the estimated regression model E(R | S, X) = 0.002 + 0.0035*S + 0.094*X. The intercept and both regression coefficents are significantly greater than 0 (p < 0.00001). By contrast, the correct causal relationship with accurately measured variables would be E(R | S, X) = 0.01*S (or, 0.01*S + 0*X). Thus, measurement error has induced a significant positive exposure coefficient (b X = 0.094) for X, even though the regression model included the confounder S on its right side. Intuitively, the reason is that measurements of X provide useful information for reducing the mean squared prediction error when R is predicted from S alone, because of the measurement error in S. However, the positive regression coefficient does not represent a dependence of risk on exposure.\" 2. In the \"Model specification error\" section, I added the following example:",

Although R depends only on the confounder S and not on exposure X, controlling for S by including it on the right side of the regression model does not fully control for its confounding effects, or preclude a statistically significant positive regression coefficient for X. Intuitively, the reason is that the shape of the assumed model (in this case, linear) is not correct, and including X and well as S helps to reduce prediction errors due to model specification error. However, although conditioning on X as well as S leads to an excellent fit as assessed by the R 2 value of 0.99, neither this high R 2 nor the small p value of the regression coefficient for X indicates that risk depends on X as well as on S. Analogous examples arise for dichotomous outcomes such as mortality. If R = 1 whenever S > 0.5, with S uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and R is otherwise 0; and if X is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 if S > 0.5, and is otherwise 0 (e.g., if X is an exposure marker that is only formed when S > 0.5), then the regression coefficient for X will be significantly positive (and larger than that for S) in a logistic regression model for R with X and S as predictors, even though R does not depend on X.\" 3.

            "text": "It is common to refer to a confounder as having been controlled, or adjusted for, when a variable representing it has been included on the right side of a regression model, even if not all relevant information about it has been captured. For example, a variable such as \"smoking status\" with possible values of current, former, or never (or, even more simply, a binary value such as 1 for \"has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life\" and 0 otherwise) might be used to \"adjust\" for smoking. Yet, such a summary variable leaves much quantitative information about smoking intensity and duration unaccounted for. Likewise, a regression model which adjusts for age by including a binary indicator such as 1 for over 65 years old, else 0, by including 5-year or 10-year age categories, leaves more detailed information about age unrepresented. Such omitted information about a confounder may induce a positive regression coefficient for exposure, even if risk does not depend on exposure; this is the problem of residual confounding. For example, if Risk = (Age/100) 2 for 0 < Age < 100 years; Exposure = Age; and the correctly specified regression model E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = b 0 + b X *Exposure + b A *Age 2 is fit to 1000 randomly generated cases with age uniformly distributed between 0 and 100, then, in the absence of measurement error and sampling error, the result is as expected: E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = (age/100) 2 . However, if age is rounded to the nearest decade, then fitting the same model yields E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = -0.03+ 0.002*Exposure + 0.00008*Age 2 . The intercept and both regression coefficients are statistically significantly different from 0 (p < 0.000001), even though risk depends only on Age and not on Exposure. Intuitively, the reason is that conditioning on Exposure reduces the mean squared prediction error for Risk due to the limited accuracy of measurement of Age, by providing information about the precise value of Age within each age category formed by rounding age to the nearest decade.",

For example, a recent study of the association between blood lead level (BLL) and age-specific mortality rate (Lanphear et al. 2018 ) used 3 categories for body mass index (BMI); 3 for self-reported smoking status (never, former, current); 2 for cotinine in blood serum (above or below 10 ng/mL); 2 for alcohol consumption; 3 for physical activity; 3 for cadmium; 2 for household income; 2 for hypertension; and 3 for a healthy eating index that runs from 1 to 100. Similarly, a regression analysis of the negative association between molybdenum (Mo) and testosterone (T) (Lewis and Meeker 2015) used 2 categories for BMI (below 25 kg/m 2 or not); 3 for income; and 2 for smoking. In such studies, the use of only a few categories for each of many potential confounders leaves unclear the extent to which reported exposure-response associations reflect residual confounding. For example, Figure 1 shows that BMI is associated with Mo and T both above and below 25 kg/m 2 , so use of a dichotomous BMI variable leaves this remaining (residual) confounding unaccounted for. The possibility of residual confounding does not necessarily imply that qualitative conclusions about exposure-response associations would change if residual confounding were better controlled, but it leaves open the question of how much they would change. To avoid this unnecessary uncertainty, it suffices to treat continuous variables as continuous, rather than artificially dichotomizing or categorizing them (Streiner 2002; Naggara et al. 2011) .",

Similarly, including county population density (average people per square mile) in a regression model for effects of PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality risk to control for the possibility that more densely populated areas might have both higher PM2.5 pollution levels and higher COVID-19 mortality risk does not fully eliminate this source of potential confounding if local population densities differ from the county average.",

As a trivial example, suppose that the causal relationships among Age, Exposure, and Risk are described by the structural equations E(Risk | Age, Exposure) = Age -Exposure and Exposure = 0.5*Age. Then the regression coefficient for Exposure is -1 if both Age and Exposure are included as predictors, but is +1 if only Exposure is included as a predictor. Including only Exposure is more parsimonious, and, once it has been selected, including Age does not improve predictive accuracy; thus E(Risk | Age, Exposure) = Exposure would be the preferred model by these criteria, even though the regression coefficient of +1",

The main idea of these algorithms is to use tests for statistical properties (such as conditional independence tests) to determine which variables each variable is found to depend on, even after conditioning on other variables.

But much remains to be done to achieve this goal. Despite impressive recent technical progress, current BN-learning algorithms remain limited by their lack of common sense. (They are typically better at determining whether variables are conditionally independent than at identifying the directions of dependences between them, and may require human users to specify constraints such as that death is a possible effect but not a possible cause of other variables, or that sex, age, and ethnicity are possible causes but not possible effects of other variables.) They are prone to identify false-positive links between variables if confounders are omitted, or if discretization of continuous variables to form CPTs (e.g., using deciles of continuous variables as levels, or using CART trees) leaves substantial residual confounding. Validation that CPTs express stable causal relationships that hold across situations typically requires collecting data from multiple studies. Recent advances in theory and software for causal analysis and interpretation (e.g., the InvariantCausalPrediction and CompareCausalNetworks R packages) have started to address these and other challenges, including detecting and modeling hidden (latent, unobserved) variables based on otherwise unexplained correlations between observed variables), but these developments have as yet had little impact on regulatory risk assessment.\" This is most clearly illustrated by the discussion of peak exposures vs. average exposures in non-constant exposure settings (pp.14-15, etc.). One can document the time patterns of internal doses, but to make any sense of this, one has to assume something about how non-constant exposure should be measured so as to be proportional to effect. Maybe it is the peak, but maybe also the longer-term average (mechanistic hypotheses could be constructed that would lead to either of these as general expectations). But probably (or at least potentially) it is a yet more complex function of the moment-by-moment variations in interactions of the tissue concentration with its targets, and the damage and repair processes that are triggered, plus (probably) the recent history of such effects and their temporal patterns of interaction with homeostatic mechanisms, plus the impact of individual-byindividual variation in these as well as how those variations themselves depend on past experience profiles. It is hopeless to try to characterize all of these completely, and so a model may be more or less sophisticated about what it tries to capture, but in the end there will inevitably be assumptions about how unspecified aspects average out or can have their impact rendered into a simplified function of their underlying complexity. The point is that there is no \"complete\" and \"correct\" model. One can (and should) argue that it is important to be insightful about how simple models regarding the structure of causation are constructed, to avoid avoidable and identifiable biases as possible, and to keep in mind that the parameter estimates arrived at by fitting to data are always contingent on the assumed model form.

Presuming a continuous distribution of susceptibility, this implies that other individuals are just barely short of the needed state and could be pushed over by even miniscule exposures.

A statistical upper bound on a linear low-dose extrapolation was taken as a \"reasonable worst case\" that at least was unlikely to be exceeded and that was difficult to refute with available information. The paper does a good job in showing the several ways how the estimation of such a slope can be problematic when it fails to consider how interactions among factors and indirect causal pathways bias the na\u00efve attribution of effect only to changes in the exposure variable. But, this said, the recommended alternative analytical approaches themselves continue to have uncertainty (even if that uncertainty is better and more appropriately characterized). A reader inclined to invoke the \"upper bound\" argument would look at the paper's Figure 2 and say that this is exactly the situation that calls for a characterized upper bound.

The first is an assumption that incremental cancer risks from exposures to chemicals (and radiation) add to background processes, leading to effective linearity of the exposure-related dose-response or C-R curves. The second is that population heterogeneity tends to linearize population C-R functions, even if individual-level ones have thresholds or other nonlinearities. The third is that statistical upper confidence limits on LNT functions are appropriately conservative or health-protective in the face of uncertainty about the true C-R functions. All three principles have been debated for years. However, some recent examinations of the additivity-to-background assumption have concluded that it is often unjustified on both mathematical and biological grounds, in part because mechanisms of exposurerelated harm, such as activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, differ from mechanisms of background (spontaneous) harm in many cases, leading to genuine thresholds or threshold-like nonlinearities for incremental risks caused by exposures . Likewise, careful explication of the population heterogeneity argument has concluded that it broadens C-R uncertainty bands, but does not linearize nonlinear functions and should not be construed as implying linear upper confidence limits at low exposure concentrations (Rhomberg, Goodman et al. 2011; . Specifically, if thresholds or sharp nonlinearities hold for individuals, a combination of uncertainty and variability in C-R functions, together with exposure estimation error, may create a range of values at the population level over which estimated population risk decreases gradually with decreasing exposure concentrations, but this does not in general imply that linear extrapolation down to zero is justified, even if it deemed prudent to use upper uncertainty limits . As illustrated on the right side of Figure 2 , Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis can lead to wide uncertainty bands that are nonetheless nonlinear. We conclude that, in general, nonlinear models deserve careful uncertainty analysis, and that simplifying LNT assumptions are not necessarily well justified even if there are positive background rates, population heterogeneity, and a desire to be conservative by using upper uncertainty distribution quantiles for purposes of regulation. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis provides a constructive approach for characterizing uncertainty in nonlinear models, including Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models, if enough is known to model uncertain quantities as random variables.\" SPECIFICS p.2, line 30 and onward -Are the \"questions\" part of the NIOSH (2020) process or the author's interpretation of them?

(My department has been involved in a similar discussion lately about the extent to which p values should be purged from the curriculum. It is true, as discussed in Nagarajan et al., that the tests of independence do ultimately rely on p-values, and in that sense are subject to some of the difficulties described for regression coefficients, in that any decision threshold such as 0.05 is somewhat arbitrary. But nonparametric tests for independence (similar in spirit to sign tests) have the considerable advantage of not requiring (or allowing) parametric modeling assumptions, thus avoiding model specification errors and model shopping. In practice, multiple tests for conditional independence in packages such as bnlearn usually give the same answers, and borderline cases (p values close to 0.05) are rare. While relying on Nagarajan et al. for a fuller discussion, I think the most important part of the answer to the reviewer's question is that the tests are nonparametric, and they are of independence, not of more complex hypotheses (e.g., for model forms, error distributions, etc. as in regression), and hence lead to relatively robust conclusions. I have tried to convey the most essential point briefly by adding \"e.g., using nonparametric tests for independence.\" p.10, line 29 -more explanation of why this accomplishes \"solving the problem of variable selection\" would be helpful. RESPONSE: Added the following additional explanation and reference: \"This solves the problem of variable selection that often bedevils regression modeling. It does so by identifying minimal sufficient subsets of variables -the \"adjustment sets\" -to condition on, i.e., to include in a (perhaps nonparametric) regression model, to estimate direct and total effects of one variable on another while avoiding biases created by failure to condition on common ancestors, or by conditioning on common descendants (Textor et al 2015) .\" p.16, line 30 -the U(i) formula is presented with no explanation or definitions. Needs expansion. RESPONSE: Removed \"In notation, A ~ U[0, 2], B ~ U [4, 8] , C ~ U [5, 9] ,\" leaving \"are independent random variables uniformly distributed between 0 and 2, between 4 and 8, and between 5 and 9,\" which means the same thing and avoids needlessly mysterious notation.",

Nonlinearities in interactions of the agent with other factors (such as co-exposures, co-morbidities, or covariates that modify the agent's effect) and dependencies among these factors, complicate the interpretation and estimation of slope factors or of entire concentration-response (C-R) curves that seek to quantify how a health endpoint depends on exposure. At a minimum, it becomes necessary to specify what is assumed about the levels of other factors, and about how (if at all) they change when exposure is changed -for example, how changing one component of a mix of pollutants changes other components that affect the same health endpoint. More generally, in both linear and nonlinear models, failing to characterize causal pathways other than those leading directly from the agent to the effect, such as indirect (mediated) pathways, or exposure-response associations due to common causes (e.g., confounders) or to common effects (e.g., sample selection criteria), can make it difficult or impossible to determine how changing exposure would change response probabilities. The possibility of nonlinearity exacerbates C-R estimation problems if high-order interactions among factors must be considered, and no small number of parameters in a simple model form can be assumed to adequately represent the data-generating process.",

They require new ways to carry out each of the health risk assessment steps of hazard identification, dose-response modeling, exposure assessment, risk characterization, and uncertainty characterization.

This paper reviews challenges for risk analysis posed by nonlinearity, and discusses constructive methods to meet these challenges using current techniques of data science and causal analytics. It focuses on techniques for using epidemiological data -typically, exposure, response, and covariate variables measured in a population over time -to identify and quantify health risks caused by exposures when underlying individual-level causal biological C-R functions are nonlinear. As an organizing framework, we take the practice of regulatory occupational risk assessment recently described by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH 2020), which we consider a clear, thoughtful exposition of key principles and practices of current regulatory risk assessment.

Rejection of this null hypothesis supports weight-of-evidence (WoE) determinations of a causal relationship between exposure and response, especially if plausible confounders have been controlled for by including them as predictor in the regression model. (Similarly for risk ratios, confident rejection of the null hypothesis that a risk ratio is 1 (no difference) in risk between more-exposed and less-exposed people in statistical analyses of relative risks, standardized mortality ratios, odds ratios in logistic regression models, or hazard ratios in Cox proportional hazards regression models, is usually interpreted as evidence supporting a causal relationship in weight-ofevidence (WoE) determinations, especially if chance, confounding, and biases have been ruled out as plausible explanations.) Against this practice is a fundamental objection that regression models quantify associations rather than causal impacts. Specifically, they quantify the conditional expected (average) value of the dependent variable, given the observed values of predictors, but this is different from answering the causal question of how or whether changing one or more of the predictors, such as exposure concentration, would change the dependent variable (Pearl 2009; Pearl and Mackenzie 2018) .",

This can happen for many reasons, even if the predicted variable does not depend on exposure. Perhaps the best known reason is that a confounder -a variable that makes both exposure and the response more likely when it is present (or, more generally, that shifts both their cumulative distribution functions rightward) -can induce a positive regression coefficient for exposure in a regression model that includes exposure but not the confounder. For example, suppose that cigarette smoking, exposure indicators such as blood concentrations of heavy metals (e.g., lead or cadmium), and response indicators such as age-specific mortality or morbidity are all mutually positively correlated in a data set. Then a regression model that omitted smoking could show positive regression coefficients for the exposure indicators, whether or not response risk depends directly on them, if they also act as surrogates for smoking, which directly affects risk. In this case, smoking would be a confounder for the estimated exposure-response association. In current practice, it is perhaps unlikely that such an obvious confounder would be omitted, unless the data were unavailable. However, fully controlling for effects of confounders can be surprisingly difficult, especially when linear models cannot be assumed.",

However, this tactic often fails to fully control for effects of confounding, for reasons discussed in the following sections on measurement errors, model specification errors, residual confounding, surrogate variables, variable selection, competing explanations, and attribution of joint effects. For example, indicators of smoking such as self-reported pack years and cotinine levels, are often imperfectly accurate (Hsieh et al. 2011) . Residual effect of confounding might then still contribute to a positive regression coefficient for exposure. Even more challenging is the problem of omitted confounders (also called latent confounders or unobserved confounders) -that is, confounders that are not included in a regression model, perhaps because they were not measured. A useful current practice is to quantify how strong the effects of omitted confounders on exposure and risk would have to be to explain away the estimated effect of exposure on response. If the required effect sizes are much larger than those for measured confounders, then this suggests that any omitted confounder(s) would have to be stronger than the measured ones to provide a plausible alternative explanation for the estimated exposure-response association.",

As a simple hypothetical illustrative example to clarify concepts, suppose that, unbeknownst to the risk modeler, the true relationship between a measure of health risk, R, and past pack-years of smoking, S, is the LNT structural equation R = 0.01*S; and that an exposure variable X (such as concentration of a metal in blood or urine) is also related to S by the equation X = 0.02*S 1/2 ; thus, S confounds the association between X and R. Consider the effect on multiple linear regression if the estimated values of S and X values are unbiased but have uniformly distributed estimation errors. Specifically, suppose that estimated values are uniformly distributed between zero and twice their corresponding true values. Fitting the regression model E(R | S, X) = b 0 + b S S + b X X to a simulated data set with 1000 cases having S values independently uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 yields the estimated regression model E(R | S, X) = 0.002 + 0.0035*S + 0.094*X. The intercept and both regression coefficents are significantly greater than 0 (p < 0.00001). By contrast, the correct causal relationship with accurately measured variables would be E(R | S, X) = 0.01*S (or, 0.01*S + 0*X). Thus, measurement error has induced a significant positive exposure coefficient (b X = 0.094) for X, even though the regression model included the confounder S on its right side. Intuitively, the reason is that measurements of X provide useful information for reducing the mean squared prediction error when R is predicted from S alone, because of the measurement error in S. However, the positive regression coefficient does not represent a dependence of risk on exposure.",

This is the problem of model specification error or model misspecification: the specified model form does not perfectly describe the data. As a simple hypothetical example, if R = S 3 and X = S 2 , where S is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, then fitting the (incorrectly specified) multiple linear model E(R | S, X) = b 0 + b S S + b X X to a simulated data set of size N = 1000 cases produces a least-squares fit of E(R | S, X) = 0.05 + 1.5*X -0.60*S, with an R 2 value of 0.99 and all coefficients and the intercept significantly different from zero (p < 0.00001). Although R depends only on the confounder S and not on exposure X, controlling for S by including it on the right side of the regression model does not fully control for its confounding effects, or preclude a statistically significant positive regression coefficient for X. Intuitively, the reason is that the shape of the assumed model (in this case, linear) is not correct, and including X and well as S helps to reduce prediction errors due to model specification error. However, although conditioning on X as well as S leads to an excellent fit as assessed by the R 2 value of 0.99, neither this high R 2 nor the small p value of the regression coefficient for X indicates that risk depends on X as well as on S. Analogous examples arise for dichotomous outcomes such as mortality. If R = 1 whenever S > 0.5, with S uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and R is otherwise 0; and if X is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 if S > 0.5, and is otherwise 0 (e.g., if X is an exposure marker that is only formed when S > 0.5), then the regression coefficient for X will be significantly positive (and larger than that for S) in a logistic regression model for R with X and S as predictors, even though R does not depend on X.",

For example, a variable such as \"smoking status\" with possible values of current, former, or never (or, even more simply, a binary value such as 1 for \"has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life\" and 0 otherwise) might be used to \"adjust\" for smoking. Yet, such a summary variable leaves much quantitative information about smoking intensity and duration unaccounted for. Likewise, a regression model which adjusts for age by including a binary indicator such as 1 for over 65 years old, else 0, by including 5-year or 10-year age categories, leaves more detailed information about age unrepresented. Such omitted information about a confounder may induce a positive regression coefficient for exposure, even if risk does not depend on exposure; this is the problem of residual confounding. For example, if Risk = (Age/100) 2 for 0 < Age < 100 years; Exposure = Age; and the correctly specified regression model E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = b 0 + b X *Exposure + b A *Age 2 is fit to 1000 randomly generated cases with age uniformly distributed between 0 and 100, then, in the absence of measurement error and sampling error, the result is as expected: E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = (age/100) 2 . However, if age is rounded to the nearest decade, then fitting the same model yields E(Risk | Exposure, Age) = -0.03+ 0.002*Exposure + 0.00008*Age 2 . The intercept and both regression coefficients are statistically significantly different from 0 (p < 0.000001), even though risk depends only on Age and not on Exposure. Intuitively, the reason is that conditioning on Exposure reduces the mean squared prediction error for Risk due to the limited accuracy of measurement of Age, by providing information about the precise value of Age within each age category formed by rounding age to the nearest decade.",

For example, a recent study of the association between blood lead level (BLL) and age-specific mortality rate (Lanphear et al. 2018 ) used 3 categories for body mass index (BMI); 3 for self-reported smoking status (never, former, current); 2 for cotinine in blood serum (above or below 10 ng/mL); 2 for alcohol consumption; 3 for physical activity; 3 for cadmium; 2 for household income; 2 for hypertension; and 3 for a healthy eating index that runs from 1 to 100. Similarly, a regression analysis of the negative association between molybdenum (Mo) and testosterone (T) (Lewis and Meeker 2015) used 2 categories for BMI (below 25 kg/m 2 or not); 3 for income; and 2 for smoking. In such studies, the use of only a few categories for each of many potential confounders leaves unclear the extent to which reported exposure-response associations reflect residual confounding. For example, Figure 1 shows that BMI is associated with Mo and T both above and below 25 kg/m 2 , so use of a dichotomous BMI variable leaves this remaining (residual) confounding unaccounted for. The possibility of residual confounding does not necessarily imply that qualitative conclusions about exposure-response associations would change if residual confounding were better controlled, but it leaves open the question of how much they would change. To avoid this unnecessary uncertainty, it suffices to treat continuous variables as continuous, rather than artificially dichotomizing or categorizing them (Streiner 2002; Naggara et al. 2011) .",

Similarly, including county population density (average people per square mile) in a regression model for effects of PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality risk to control for the possibility that more densely populated areas might have both higher PM2.5 pollution levels and higher COVID-19 mortality risk does not fully eliminate this source of potential confounding if local population densities differ from the county average.",

This creates a positive association (reflected in a positive regression coefficient) between cumulative exposure and risk of poor health, even if exposure per se does not affect health. If poor health is a predictor of increased risk for some diseases (e.g., cancers or heart diseases) in old age, then retired workers with the high cumulative exposures will be more likely to develop such diseases because of underlying poor health, even if exposure has no causal impact on health. Another example of a non-causal explanation that does not involve underlying health status would be if workers stay in a certain occupation only if they are poor or have low exposures (or both). If poverty causes increased health risks but exposure has no direct causal effect on health risks, then a study of workers who have stayed in the occupation may find that those with low exposures are less likely to be poor (since low exposures provide an alternative explanation for the choice to stay) and hence have lower average health risks. If poverty is not measured, but exposure and health effects are, there will be a positive association between exposure and risk (mediated by the unmeasured variable poverty), even if exposure does not affect risk.

Then a generalized linear regression model, such as logistic regression, will assign significantly positive regression coefficients to each of the three exposures if there are a large enough number of observations (each consisting of values of A, B, and C for an individual). This remains true even if the data are modified to set A = 0 whenever B + C < 15 (e.g., if pollutant A is formed only by sufficiently high levels of pollutants B and C). Yet, in this case, A makes no contribution to risk. Whether a disease occurs depends only on the values of B and C. Thus, regression can create a significant positive regression coefficients for an exposure as a predictor of risk by (mis)attributing part of the joint effect of multiple variables to it, even if has no causal impact on risk. (Special techniques that deal more consistently with attribution of risk in the presence of joint causes, such as Shapley regression, avoid this problem, but are seldom used in regulatory risk assessment.) Finally, if the distribution of either B or C (or both) is changed to a bimodal distribution that is equally likely to be 0 or 20, then the regression coefficient for A becomes zero (or, rather, is not significantly different from 0 in large data sets). Thus, whether regression analysis provides evidence that A has a significant positive regression coefficient depends on the distributions of other variables, rather than only on the causal biological effect (if any) of A itself.

Flexible nonparametric regression models (using techniques such as locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS), locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS), or splines) can also show where empirical relationships depart from parametric (e.g., linear or generalized linear) modeling assumptions, as in Figure 1 . Such techniques avoid the risk of overfitting inherent in many parametric models with (e.g., high-order polynomial regression models) by fitting simple low-order models to data in the neighborhood of each point of estimation (NIST 2013) . For large data sets with many potential predictors, there are many alternatives to regression modeling; here we mention some of them, In reality, however, changing a single explanatory variable, such as the exposure concentration of a pollutant in ambient air, might cause the values of multiple other variables to change, making it unrealistic to hold their values fixed in assessing total effects on the dependent variable. To deal with this situation, causal Bayesian network (BN) propagate changes in the values of input variables (such as exposure) to changes in the conditional probability distributions of variables that depend on them. The full methodology for BN learning and inference from data is quite detailed; we refer the reader to Nagarajan et al. (2013) and for details. An arrow joins two variables in a BN if they are found to be dependent (i.e., mutually informative about each other, so that the null hypothesis of conditional independence -that the conditional probability distribution for one is the same for all values of the other -can be confidently rejected, e.g., using nonparametric tests for independence; see Nagarajan et al. 2013 ). If effects depend on their direct causes, then a BN provides evidence that X might be a direct cause of Y if and only if they are linked by an arrow. (Figure 2 , discussed in the next section, is an example of a BN.) If Y is conditionally independent of X given the values of other variables (such as common causes), so that there is no arrow between them, then the BN provides no evidence that X might be a direct cause of Y.",

Such a BN shows that exposure is a hazard, i.e., a potential direct cause of risk, if and only if exposure and risk are joined by an arrow. (The specific set of other variables that should be conditioned on -including confounders or common causes, but not common effects, of exposure and risk -to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of exposure on risk constitutes what is called an adjustment set. Adjustment sets can be calculated from BNs by modern causal analysis algorithms . This solves the problem of variable selection that often bedevils regression modeling. It does so by identifying minimal sufficient subsets of variables -the \"adjustment sets\" -to condition on, i.e., to include in a (perhaps nonparametric) regression model, to estimate direct and total effects of one variable on another while avoiding biases created by failure to condition on common ancestors, or by conditioning on common descendants (Textor et al 2015) .) Some causal analysis algorithms attempt to orient the arrows between variables in a BN to reflect the flow of causality (and information) between variables, but even without such orientation of arrows, the structure of a BN is useful for hazard identification insofar as it shows whether risk is found to depend on exposure after adjusting for other variables.",

But much remains to be done to achieve this goal. Despite impressive recent technical progress, current BN-learning algorithms remain limited by their lack of common sense. (They are typically better at determining whether variables are conditionally independent than at identifying the directions of dependences between them, and may require human users to specify constraints such as that death is a possible effect but not a possible cause of other variables, or that sex, age, and ethnicity are possible causes but not possible effects of other variables.) They are prone to identify false-positive links between variables if confounders are omitted, or if discretization of continuous variables to form CPTs (e.g., using deciles of continuous variables as levels, or using CART trees) leaves substantial residual confounding. Validation that CPTs express stable causal relationships that hold across situations typically requires collecting data from multiple studies. Recent advances in theory and software for causal analysis and interpretation (e.g., the InvariantCausalPrediction and CompareCausalNetworks R packages) have started to address these and other challenges, including detecting and modeling hidden (latent, unobserved) variables based on otherwise unexplained correlations between observed variables), but these developments have as yet had little impact on regulatory risk assessment.",

Figure 3 is a notional diagram, without specific units on its axes, showing typical time patterns for how the internal dose (e.g., concentration of a toxic metabolite in a target organ or tissue) on the vertical axis varies over time (on the horizontal axis) for three different time patterns of dose administration (curves 1, 2, and 3). For an inhalation hazard, the administered dose rate corresponds to concentration of a substance in air. Curve 1 administers a certain concentration for a certain duration in each cycle of a repeated exposure pattern; curve 2 administers twice the concentration for half the duration; and curve 3 administers 3 times the concentration for 1/3 the duration, in each consecutive cycle. The vertical axis shows how concentration in a typical compartment varies with these time patterns of exposure. Specific versions of such model-predicted curves have been developed and validated for many chemicals using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. For purposes of dose-response modeling, an important feature is that administering higher concentrations for shorter durations produces higher peak internal concentrations than lower concentrations for longer durations, for the same total amount delivered (e.g., for the same ppm-hours per week). This implies that curve 3 can activate responses that curve 1 would not. If a response has an internal dose concentration threshold (denoted by T in Figure 3) , as in the examples mentioned in the Introduction (e.g., for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome), then repeated high-concentration, short-duration exposures are more dangerous than administering the same average amounts per unit time more gradually. Figure 4 illustrates the effects of such nonlinearity, motivated by a model for accumulation of asbestos fibers in lung and mesothelial tissue . The vertical axis represents the amount of internal dose (e.g., fibers) added to a target tissue per unit time for different administered concentrations in air (horizontal axis), assuming sustained exposure to a constant concentration. The axes are scaled so that 1 on the horizontal axis represents the base case exposure scenario, e.g., what a typical worker might receive. The vertical axis shows the increase in cumulative internal dose (e.g., fibers lodged in target tissues) per unit time, and the curve plots this for different levels of administered concentration on the horizontal axis. Doubling exposure concentration from 1 to 2 increases the rate at which cumulative internal dose increases from about 1 to about 14, reflecting slower clearance from the lungs (e.g., via macrophages and the mucociliary escalator) and hence a higher fraction of inhaled dose (fibers) translocating to target tissues. By contrast, doubling exposure concentration from 0.1 to 0.2 makes relatively little difference, as most of the administered dose is cleared at such low concentrations. Similar reasoning sheds light on the question of whether a worker suffers greater risk if exposed to a hazardous substance on two consecutive days each week (e.g., Monday and Tuesday) or on two days separated by a longer recovery interval (e.g., Monday and Friday). If the first day's exposure reduces clearance (or depletes protective resources such as antioxidant pools), then another exposure on the next day may create a greater internal dose than it would if it instead occurred a few days later, when clearance capacity has recovered. If so, then exposures on consecutive days in each cycle (e.g., in a work week) will produce more internal dose than the same exposures administered with longer recovery periods in between. The timing of internal doses can also interact with response dynamics, e.g., by delaying cell division during and following a first exposure until internal doses decline enough for mitosis to proceed safely; if the cells thus synchronized and undergoing mitosis at approximately the same time, receive a second dose part way through it, the cytotoxic effect may be far larger than if the second dose had occurred earlier or later. These examples reinforce the key point that timing matters: for many substances, the same average cumulative exposure per unit time can have very different effects on risk of adverse response, depending on how it is distributed over time.",

When response thresholds or other nonlinearities in dose-response functions are important, accurate risk prediction may require more detailed descriptions of exposure histories than are captured in the exposure metrics used in regression-based risk modeling. Conversely, when only these exposure metrics are available, it may be impossible to predict risk from them with useful accuracy.

Similar caveats hold for other nonlinearities less extreme than thresholds: exposure estimation errors distort (and typically flatten and linearize) estimated exposure-response relationships (Rhomberg et al. 2011) . In simple linear regression models with exposure as the only predictor, ignoring measurement error biases the estimated slope (or potency) of the exposure-response line toward zero. By contrast, in nonlinear and multiple regression models, the bias can go in either direction. If higher exposures are disproportionately dangerous, as in Figure 4 , then neglecting errors in estimated exposures leads to over-estimates of risks at low exposures (since some high-exposure risks are misattributed to lower estimated exposures) and to underestimates of risks at high exposures (since some low-exposure risks are misattributed to higher exposure levels). Thus, nonlinearity implies that measurement error need not attenuate estimated effects of exposure on risk, as in simple linear regression models, but rather exaggerates it at low concentrations and attenuates it at high concentrations.",

Fortunately, as mentioned in Table 1 , a variety of \"errors-in-variables\" statistical methods have been developed to correct for the distorting effects of measurement or estimation errors in exposure and other predictors. Computational Bayesian methods infer the shape of the exposure-response function by treating the true exposure as an unobserved quantity on which the estimated exposure depends. Other techniques (such as instrumental variables and repeated measurement methods) use observations on other variables, or repeated observations of the same variables, to help estimate the true shape of the exposure-response function when exposures are estimated with errors.

A different possible explanation is that causally ineffective reductions in exposures do not reduce the risks attributed to them as originally predicted by regression models (e.g., because imperfectly controlled confounding or nonlinearities or interactions created regression coefficients that do not represent the causal effect on risk per unit reduction in exposure). Attributing undiminished risk to substantially lowered exposures increases the regression coefficient linking exposure to risk. This can create the appearance of higher risk-per-unit-exposure at lower concentrations (supralinearity) simply because the exposure-risk association attributes risk to exposures that do not cause it. Figure 5 illustrates some of these points. It fits three univariate models -linear, quadratic, and nonparametric smoothing regression curves -to data on blood lead concentration levels (x axis) and mortality during follow-up for nonsmokers in the NHANES data set. (Logistic regression would also seem appropriate a priori, but does not fit the data well, as the conditional expected value of the mortality rate is not a sigmoid function of concentration.) The data are used only to illustrate some conceptual and methodological points, so we forego discussion of details of the data set (or of alternative regression models, such as proportional hazards, that would better address survival data); the full data set can be downloaded from [URL TO BE ADDED HERE]. The linear and quadratic models have 95% confidence bands (shown as dashed curves). The nonparametric regression curve is approximately flat at the right edge of the plot, where the linear model slopes up and the quadratic model slopes down. Although model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit tests can help select the best-fitting parametric model (e.g., quadratic rather than linear), they do not fix the fact that even the best-fitting model in a parametric class of models may not fit the data very well. Confidence bands do not communicate this aspect of model uncertainty: the confidence intervals in Figure 5 are narrow compared to the range of predictions from different models. For this reason, sensitivity analysis (discussed later) is often used to assess the extent to which predictions from different models differ (NIOSH 2020) . This leaves open the question of how to reconcile (or select or combine) risk predictions from different models, as well as the question of whether any of the different models considered makes accurate predictions.",

For example, if the strong positive association between BLL and mortality risk were entirely explained by incompletely controlled confounding by age (i.e., older people having higher BLL and higher mortality probabilities, with a nonlinear increase in mortality risk at older ages (and higher BLL levels) that is not entirely corrected for including age as a predictor in a regression model), then the models in Figure 5 would have no implications for how much or whether reducing lead concentrations would reduce risk. That statistical risk models do not necessarily describe how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk, even if they fit observed data well and have tight confidence limits, is well understood by many epidemiologists. It is not always as clear to risk managers and regulatory risk assessors, many of whom seek to use quantitative estimates of low-dose risk obtained from regressionbased dose-response models to inform decisions about how to limit exposures in order to protect health (NIOSH 2020), without understanding that regression-based dose-response (or exposure-response) curves are usually not appropriate for this purpose because they do not reveal how changing exposures would change risks (Pearl 2009 ). Risk and uncertainty characterization and communication of risk assessment results to decision-makers should clarify such uncertainty about consequences of interventions in order to inform rational and effective decision-making. More constructively, presenting results from validated causal Bayesian network risk models (Pearl 2009; Hack et al. 2010; and dynamic simulation risk models can show how interventions, such as reducing exposure, are predicted to change the probability distributions of outcomes such as disease and mortality risks.",

The first is an assumption that incremental cancer risks from exposures to chemicals (and radiation) add to background processes, leading to effective linearity of the exposure-related dose-response or C-R curves. The second is that population heterogeneity tends to linearize population C-R functions, even if individual-level ones have thresholds or other nonlinearities. The third is that statistical upper confidence limits on LNT functions are appropriately conservative or health-protective in the face of uncertainty about the true C-R functions. All three principles have been debated for years. However, some recent examinations of the additivity-to-background assumption have concluded that it is often unjustified on both mathematical and biological grounds, in part because mechanisms of exposurerelated harm, such as activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, differ from mechanisms of background (spontaneous) harm in many cases, leading to genuine thresholds or threshold-like nonlinearities for incremental risks caused by exposures . Likewise, careful explication of the population heterogeneity argument has concluded that it broadens C-R uncertainty bands, but does not linearize nonlinear functions and should not be construed as implying linear upper confidence limits at low exposure concentrations (Rhomberg, Goodman et al. 2011; . Specifically, if thresholds or sharp nonlinearities hold for individuals, a combination of uncertainty and variability in C-R functions, together with exposure estimation error, may create a range of values at the population level over which estimated population risk decreases gradually with decreasing exposure concentrations, but this does not in general imply that linear extrapolation down to zero is justified, even if it deemed prudent to use upper uncertainty limits . As illustrated on the right side of Figure 2 , Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis can lead to wide uncertainty bands that are nonetheless nonlinear. We conclude that, in general, nonlinear models deserve careful uncertainty analysis, and that simplifying LNT assumptions are not necessarily well justified even if there are positive background rates, population heterogeneity, and a desire to be conservative by using upper uncertainty distribution quantiles for purposes of regulation. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis provides a constructive approach for characterizing uncertainty in nonlinear models, including Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models, if enough is known to model uncertain quantities as random variables.",

NIOSH defines sensitivity analysis as a study of the uncertainty in estimates from the mathematical model that can be apportioned to uncertainties in its inputs.\" Sensitivity analyses inform decision-makers about how predictions depend on uncertain modeling assumptions, for example, by showing the different risk predictions made by different models (e.g., the linear and quadratic models in Figure 5 ). However, they do not identify whether any of the alternatives is close to the truth. Moreover, they are limited to studying how changes in assumed inputs affect outputs, but they do not address uncertainty about what the outputs mean, such as whether estimated C-R functions reflect association or causation (or both).",

Using statistical techniques and algorithms usually outperforms expert judgment, in a variety of domains (Tetlock and Gardner 2015) . Moreover, the previous sections have illustrated that the specific technical challenges arising in risk assessment can be quite subtle and challenging, making it difficult to see how scientific judgment alone can address them usefully. Scientific judgment used in lieu of available statistical techniques and algorithms might be hard pressed to yield useful assessments and corrections for residual confounding due to slight departures from linearity ( Figure 1 ); or to reliably assess whether a repeated exposure will produce internal doses that exceed a threshold ( Figure 3 ); or to adjust correctly for nonlinearities in extrapolating from high to low exposure concentrations ( Figure 4 ); or to predict how correcting for exposure measurement errors and for variance and autocorrelations in exposure time series would change the shapes of estimated C-R functions; or to estimate the results of averaging the risk predictions from an ensemble of models while varying exposure and holding other variables fixed, as in a partial dependence plot. These are not types of tasks that judgment excels at. Scientific judgments about causality are notoriously error-prone (Kahneman 2011) , and C-R regression curves and confidence intervals do not offer even the most discerning judgment the empirical information needed to determine how or whether changing exposure would change risk ( Figure 5, Pearl 2009 ). Judgments organized, tested, and validated using causal Bayesian network appear to be promising for addressing causal questions (Pearl 2009 ) and for quantifying causal C-R functions ( Figure 2 ). However, testing and validating such models with data makes heavy use of statistical methods and algorithms (such as conditional independence tests, calculation of adjustment sets, estimation of conditional probability tables of functions, and inference of causal exposure-response relations controlling for the variables in adjustment sets) ).",

Thus, scientific judgment is often essential in identifying appropriate model structures and simplifications, and in specifying what needs to be estimated from data, e.g., exposure-dependent transition rates or flow rates among model compartments.

Thus, the practical design of regulations that better protect worker health by addressing these aspects of exposure appears to be a worthwhile topic for further applied research. Dynamic simulation modeling can help to understand effects of proposed regulations on risk, accounting for realistic variability and autocorrelations in exposure time series; time patterns of mean exposure concentrations within working weeks and over lifetimes; inter-individual variability in exposure response parameters; and exposure estimation errors and uncertainty .

Wellspecified regression models can be highly useful for estimating conditional probability and conditional expected value relationships between a variable and its direct causes, if these are known and suitable adjustment sets have been identified. However, regression per se does not address the causal interpretation of the C-R curves that it produces (Pearl 2009 ). Judgment is not usually a viable substitute for more formal analytic methods (Kahneman 2011; Tetlock and Gardner 2015) ; conversely, even the best current formal analytic methods cannot replace the scientific judgment and knowledge needed to create dynamic simulation models and other detailed causal models of complex biological processes. Even strong and statistically significant associations observed in well-designed and controlled health impact assessment studies do not necessarily translate into valid causal relationships between the studied variables.

Rather, causal analysis clarifies whether a data set provides evidence of a dependence of effects on exposure that is not fully explained away by standard alternative explanations such as confounding, model specification error, and measurement error.

Now they are increasingly being included in state-of-the-art risk analysis practice and guidance (NIOSH 2020).

Dynamic simulation modeling can help to understand effects of proposed regulations on risk, accounting for realistic variability and autocorrelations in exposure time series; time patterns of mean exposure concentrations within working weeks and over lifetimes; inter-individual variability in exposure response parameters; and exposure estimation errors and uncertainty (Cox 2020). However, developing and validating dynamic simulation models of exposures, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and disease processes requires considerable research compared to regression modeling of estimated exposure-response data. Recognizing the limitations and challenges of regression modeling for nonlinear C-R functions does not imply that regression modeling should not be used in risk assessment, characterization, and communication; but only that it should be used and interpreted carefully, and in conjunction with other techniques that better address causality.

A practical illustration concerns hazard identification of the metal molybdenum (Mo) as a hazard that might cause decreased testosterone (T) in men. For example,Lewis and Meeker (2015) presented a multiple linear regression of the dependent variable log(T) against the predictors log(Mo), BMI (body mass index), and others, in order to estimate the statistical effect of log(Mo) on log(T) while controlling for potential confounding by BMI. (For simplicity, we focus on these three variables; the full model also included age and other potential confounders.) The multiple linear regression model showed statistically significant negative regression coefficients for both log(Mo) and BMI, i.e., greater values of each are associated with smaller values of T (and log(T)), given the value of the other. This led to the tentative identification of Mo as a reproductive hazard. As the authors state, \"In adjusted analyses where metals were modeled as a continuous variable, we found significant inverse associations between urinary molybdenum and serum copper and serum testosterone. \u2026These findings add to the limited human evidence that exposure to molybdenum and other metals is associated with altered testosterone in men, which may have important implications for male health.\" Linear and nonlinear (smoothing) regressions for log(T) and log(Mo) as functions of BMI. The nonlinear curves are fit to the data using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS).Accounting for nonlinearity changes this conclusion.Figure 1shows scatter plots of log(T) (upper, blue scatter plot) and log(Mo) (lower, red scatter plot) against BMI in kg/m 2 with linear regression lines and nonparametric (smoothing) regression curves superimposed on the data so that departures from linearity can be seen easily. (The data are for men aged 18-55 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2011-2016.) Although the nonparametric regression curves are close to the linear regression lines for BMI between 25 and 35, deviations from linearity occur at relatively high and low values of BMI. These nonlinearities allow the mean squared error (MSE) of log(T) values predicted from BMI using the regression line to be reduced by including log(Mo) as an additional predictor.

A PDP shows how the average predicted value of the dependent variable (e.g., risk) changes as an explanatory variable of interest (e.g., exposure) is varied over its range, holding the values all other variables fixed at their observed levels in the data set.

Regression describes associations among observed values of variables. These may not reveal how or whether risk would change if exposure were changed (with or without holding values of other variables fixed)(Pearl 2009). As already discussed, a significantly positive regression coefficient for exposure may arise simply because conditioning on measured values of exposure reduces the prediction error (MSE) from model specification errors or from measurement errors in other predictors. It may arise from attribution of joint effects, or from competing explanations, or from coincident historical trends. Dose-response models derived by regression modeling of epidemiological data reflect these non-causal sources of association, as well as any causal contributions.",

The conditional probability distribution of each variable (node in the network) depends on the values of the variables that point into it. This BN was constructed manually based on a detailed literature review of candidate markers and outcomes and predictive relationships among them, given limitations in measurement techniques (Hack et al. 2010). The right side of Figure 2 shows random samples drawn (via Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis) from the BN-predicted dose-response function describing the conditional probability for AML given air benzene exposure concentrations. These curves are constructed from the conditional probability tables of the BN, as follows. Each value for benzene concentration (ppm) in inhaled air determines a conditional probability distribution for the benzene metabolite urinary tt-MA (trans-trans muconic acid). The value of tt-MA, in turn, determines a conditional probability distribution for 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress in lymphocytes. Finally, the value of 8-OHdG determines a conditional probability for AML. For each benzene concentration, a value of tt-MA is sampled from the conditional distribution of tt-MA, given the ppm of benzene; then a value for 8-OHdG is drawn from its conditional distribution given the sampled value of tt-MA; and finally this value is used to determine the conditional probability for AML given the sampled value of 8-OHdG. The needed conditional probabilities constitute the quantitative part of the BN model; they are estimated from data collected in multiple studies. Repeating this Monte Carlo sampling many times and averaging the results yields an estimate of the dose-response curve giving the conditional probability of AML for each value of air benzene concentration.
