As the debates continue to fix the responsibility for the birth and spread of this deadly virus and the lack of readiness to handle its disastrous impact (Patterson, 2020, Qato, 2020, Smakaj, 2020), public health experts seem to mainly view it through the lens of medicine, epidemiology, and health science disciplines. However, public health is an interdisciplinary subject that involves social sciences, public policy, public education, economics, and management (Jambroes et al., 2014, Tulchinsky and Varavikova, 2014). Hence, a failure to have a proper public health policy may not only lead to a huge loss of human lives; it can also shatter the economy, expose the incompetence of the public bodies including the governments and political leaders, and weaken the confidence of the general public (United Nation, 2020).",

The authors begin with an extensive review of the relevant literature to develop a conceptual model and specific hypotheses about the impact of gender equity and human development on women\u2019s representation in legislature and public health expenditure, and the combined impact of public health expenditure along with human environment (population density, aging population and urban population) on important public health outcomes in the Covid-19 context, including the total number of tests, diagnosed, active and critical cases, and deaths. The authors use the data from 210 countries to find support for many hypotheses. The results provide useful insights about the factors that influence the representation of women in political systems around the world and its impact on public health outcomes. The authors also discuss implications for public health policy-makers to ensure efficient and effective delivery of public health services in future.",

            "text": "Past research shows significant psychological and cognitive differences in personality, values, and concerns between women and men. For example, women tend to be more cautious (Lundeberg, Fox, & Pun\u0107ocha\u0155, 1994), risk-averse (Agnew et al., 2008, Byrnes et al., 1999), and fatalistic (Pandey & Jain, 2017) than men. Women put more emphasis on risk attributes (e.g., possibility of loss) in investment decisions than men (Olsen & Cox, 2001) and perceive more risk in traffic and environmental hazards (Dejoy, 1992, Fllyn et al., 1994). Besides being risk averse, women are also loss averse (Brooks & Zank, 2005). In addition, there is a difference in risk-taking behavior between female and make leaders for the decisions making for themselves and their groups. Ertac and Gurdal (2012) show male leaders take more risk for the decisions made for their own and the groups than male non-leaders. On the contrary, female leaders take less risk on behalf of a group which is lower than that taken individually. These differences in over-confidence and risk aversion levels between females and males make females to be more cautious and take less risk in making decisions. Hence, the authors hypothesize as follows:\nH1. Gender equity has a positive effect on, a) representation of women in legislature, and b) public health expenditure.\n",

Human development is related to health condition. Education level and economic condition are factors influencing health status. The well-educated are less likely to have economic hardship. They also have a greater sense of healthiness and healthier behaviors such as less/no smoking, more physical exercise, and medical check-ups to improve their health. The wealthier people with higher income have greater purchasing power for healthier lifestyle (healthy food, better nutrition, more protected medical insurance).

Most recent studies examine these outcomes from a medical or therapeutic perspective (e.g., Murthy, Gomersall, & Fowler, 2020) despite much debate in media on the role of public policy makers, politicians, and general public in the spread of this virus. Past research shows a positive link between public health expenditure and its outcomes (Kim & Lane, 2013), such as infant mortality and life expectancy rates (Nixon & Ulmann, 2006). Hence, it would be expected that greater expenditure on public health infrastructure such as hospitals, ICU facilities and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks and gowns, and healthcare professionals, would help deliver positive results in the battle against Covid-19. Hence, the authors hypothesize direct effects of public health expenditure on the various Covid-19 outcomes as follows:\nH4. Public health expenditure has a positive effect on the total number of Covid-19 a) tests, b) diagnosed, c) active, and d) critical cases, and e) a negative effect on the number of deaths.\n",

            "text": "Human environment, which consists of elements such as population density, urbanization, and age structure, is a major factor influencing public health. World Health Organization reports the negative impact of high population density and urbanization on mental and physical health (WHO, 2020a, b). Rapid urbanization in most countries in the last few decades has led to inadequate housing, congested public transport, poor hygiene, and high pollution level (air, water, and noise), which results in physical and mental health problems (WHO, 2020b, WHO, 2020). In fact, infectious diseases and epidemics (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia) are also more likely to happen in densely populated and urban areas (WHO, 2020a, b). As higher population density is expected to lead to more active transport, more perceived stress and smoking, it has negative effects on mortality (Beenackers, Groeniger, Kamphuis, & Van Lenthe, 2018) and health conditions (Greiner, Li, Kawachi, Hunt, & Ahluwalia, 2004). Similarly, age structure of a population affects the social (e.g., social protection), economic (e.g., labor force), and health (e.g., healthcare for elderly) systems and policies of a country. The functioning of the immune system declines with age, which influences the physical strength of the elderly to respond to infection. There is a negative relationship between physical health condition and age (Ma et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2011). Hence, as follows:\nH5. Number of tests for Covid-19 are influenced positively by a) population density, b) aging population, and c) urban population.\nH6. Number of deaths due to Covid-19 are influenced positively by a) population density, b) aging population, and c) urban population.\n",

All the measures for gender equity, women in legislature, human development, public health expenditure and human environment are from the year 2018 or earlier; whereas all the public health outcomes related to Covid-19 are the current figures. This temporal separation between the predictor and outcome variables helps eliminate any concerns about endogeneity or reverse causality (Mertens, Pugliese, & Recker, 2017). Moreover, all the measures are either indices or ratios, to avoid confounds due to any other between-country differences. Table 1\nshows the sample profile using three levels for each characteristics.\u2022\nGender equity. Reversed score for Gender Inequality Index, which is a composite index ranking countries in terms of gender gap with three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation (UNDP, 2020).\u2022\nWomen in Legislature. Percentage of females elected to the legislative body of a country (World Bank, 2020).\u2022\nHuman development. Human Development Index (UNDP, 2020) is a composite index ranking countries in terms of human development based on three dimension indices, life expectancy index, education index, and income index.\u2022\nPublic health expenditure. Current expenditure on public health by a country as a percentage of its GDP (UNDP, 2020).\u2022\nPublic health outcomes. Five indicators related to Covid-19 pandemic (Worldometers, 2020), including a) number of tests performed to diagnose a Covid-19 case, b) number of diagnosed cases (patients diagnosed with Covid-19 infection), c) number of active cases (currently infected patients), d) number of critical cases (those in serious condition e.g., admitted to ICU), and e) number of people dead due to Covid-19. All these indicators are divided by the country\u2019s population to avoid any possible confound due to the wide variation in the size of populations for the countries in the sample.\u2022\nHuman environment. Three indicators reported by UNDP (2020). Population density is the number of people (in millions) per square kilometer. Population above 65 years (%) is the ratio of people above the age of 65 years to the total population. Urban population (%) is the proportion of population living in urban areas.\n",

All the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values are less than the recommended cut-off value of three, hence multi-collinearity is not a concern (Hair et al., 2019). Next, R-square values are high for many outcome variables (e.g., number of tests = 0.13, diagnosed cases = 0.28, and deaths = 0.45), hence the model explains a significant proportion of variance in these variables. High values of the blindfolding-based cross-validated redundancy measure Q2 also confirm the predictive accuracy of the PLS path model (Hair et al., 2019).

However, despite these calls, women continue to be under-represented in top national and global healthcare organizations (WHO, 2017) and even government and legislatures (UNDP, 2020). This paper addresses these calls for greater representation of women in leadership roles by exploring the impact of gender equity on public health outcomes during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Using publicly available data for 210 countries, the authors analyze the impact of gender equity and human development on women\u2019s representation in legislature and public health expenditure, and the impact of public health expenditure and human environment (population density, aging population and urban population) on Covid-19 outcomes (number of tests, diagnosed, active and critical cases, and deaths).",

However, the unexpected negative effect of human development on women in legislature and no significant effect on public health expenditure suggests a relook at the definition of human development. Moreover, the lack of any significant impact of public health expenditure on the number of tests or deaths may indicate possible mismanagement of public health systems due to unclear policies and priorities in many countries during this crisis, which has already led to calls for improvement in future (Patterson, 2020, Qato, 2020). Both aging population and urban population have significant positive effects on the number of tests but only urban population has a positive effect on the number of deaths, which is not surprising as these two population segments have been the worst hit by the Covid-19 outbreak so far (Keil, Connolly, & Ali, 2020). Interestingly, population density has no impact on the number of tests or deaths, which suggests some biases in the way these tests are being conducted and the deaths are being reported (Kwiatkowski & Nadolny, 2020).",

For example, women tend to be more vulnerable at home and in the workplace, due to which they are more likely to suffer the economic impact of Covid-19 crisis (Linde & Gonzalez, 2020). Moreover, women comprise 70% of the global healthcare workforce and their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly different to those of their male counterparts, especially due to the unique risks and vulnerabilities faced by women due to \u201cdeep-rooted inequalities and traditional gender roles\u201d (Papp & Hersh, 2020).

Clearly, Covid-19 has revealed the vulnerabilities of the modern civilization and economic systems, wherein the so-called developed countries account for most of the diagnosed cases and deaths, although it is still early days and we need to wait to see its impact on the less developed countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, before we can make a full assessment and recommendations, especially about the role of gender equity in managing this crisis.",
