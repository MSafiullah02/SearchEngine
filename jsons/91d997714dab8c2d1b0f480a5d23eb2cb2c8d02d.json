            "text": "Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is a global concern. Efforts to restore grasslands often assume that removal of woody plants benefits biodiversity but assumptions are rarely tested. In the Chihuahuan Desert of the Southwestern United States, we tested whether abundances of grassland specialist bird species would be greater in plant communities resulting from treatment with herbicides to remove encroaching shrubs compared with untreated shrub-dominated areas that represented pretreatment conditions. In 2010, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation at 16 treated-untreated pairs. In 2011, we expanded the survey effort to 21 treated-untreated pairs, seven unpaired treatment areas, and five reference grassland areas. Vegetation in treatment areas had higher perennial grass foliar and basal cover and lower shrub foliar cover compared with untreated areas. Several regionally declining grassland specialists exhibited higher occurrence and relative abundance in treated areas. A shrubland specialist, however, was associated with untreated areas and may be negatively impacted by shrub removal. Bird community composition differed between treated and untreated areas in both years. Our results indicate that shrub removal can have positive effects on grassland specialist bird species, but that a mosaic of treated and untreated areas might be most beneficial for regional biodiversity.",

Consequently, restoration strategies employ woody plant removal as a means to recover historical conditions (Whitford 2002; Archer et al. 2011) . The assumption that woody plant removal has positive effects on biodiversity, however, typically goes untested. The lack of quantitative information about the effects of woody plant removal has engendered controversy regarding the value of this restoration approach, particularly when reference conditions are uncertain or when restoration of historical conditions is incomplete (Fensham 2008; Archer et al. 2011) . Furthermore, existing studies suggest that species of interest can respond positively (Coppedge et al. 2004; Smyth & Haukos 2010) or negatively (Martin & McIntyre 2007; Kutt & Martin 2010; Isaacs et al. 2013) to woody plant removal, depending on species' habitat requirements and the nature of habitat change induced by woody plant removal. The varying impacts of woody plant removal on species of conservation concern underscore the need for quantitative evaluations of woody plant removal effects in different ecosystems.",

Consequently, the restoration of historical grassland or savanna vegetation structure from dense shrubland is expected to result in population increases of grassland specialists. Alternatively, if restoration treatments are incapable of restoring habitat structures and elements used by grassland specialists, their populations may not increase and the loss of shrubland specialists could lead to overall declines in biodiversity (Whitford 1997) .",

First, we compared vegetation structure in three general areas: treated but formerly shrub-dominated areas, untreated shrubdominated areas, and remnant grassland reference areas. Most shrub removal treatment areas were paired with untreated shrub-dominated areas based on soil and landscape position. Grassland reference areas were within the study region, comparable in size and site characteristics to treatment areas, but dominated by perennial grasses. We expected treatment areas would have higher perennial grass cover and lower shrub cover than untreated areas (Perkins et al. 2006) . Restoration trajectories in arid grasslands may unfold over decades (Whitford 2002) , so we reasoned that older treatment areas would have higher grass cover than younger treatment areas and exhibit environmental characteristics most similar to reference grasslands. Alternatively, shrubs might reinvade old treatment areas and differences from nearby untreated, shrub-dominated areas would diminish compared with young treatment areas.",

This analytical technique has the advantage of modeling nonlinear species responses to multiple, interacting environmental factors. Response variables were probability of occurrence for three grassland specialist species: Cassin's sparrows (Peucaea cassinii ), horned larks, and eastern meadowlarks; one grassland facultative species: scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), and two shrubland specialists: mourning dove (Zenaida aurita) and loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus).

Models indicate grassland specialist and facultative species, including scaled quail, eastern meadowlark and horned lark respond positively to decreasing shrub cover. These results support our prediction that grassland specialists tolerant of moderate shrub cover (i.e. Cassin's sparrow and eastern meadowlark) should respond positively to treatments. Smythe and Haukos (2010) observed a similar response of Cassin's sparrows in herbicide-treated sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii ) communities of Southeastern New Mexico. Also consistent with our results, Block and Morrison (2010) found that horned larks were absent in areas of moderate shrub cover and instead occurred primarily in pure grasslands where they avoided even short-stature woody cover.",

The association of a shrubland specialist (black-tailed gnatcatcher) with untreated areas suggests that habitat quality for these birds may be reduced by shrub removal. For some shrubland specialist species such as loggerhead shrikes and mourning doves, we did not find clear evidence of treatment effects; instead their abundance may be governed by landscape-scale patterns (Gutzwiller & Barrow 2002; St-Louis et al. 2010) . Another shrubland specialist, the black-throated sparrow, used both treated and untreated areas, perhaps reflecting the use of different habitat types for foraging or nesting, or responses to habitat elements that were unchanged by the manipulations (Table S1 ; Paritte 2010). To favor declining species, it may be valuable to expand representation of habitat conditions produced by shrub-removal treatments. Nonetheless, preservation of shrub-dominated areas is also warranted due to the positive effects of shrubs on blacktailed gnatcatchers found here and on bird diversity found in other studies (Naranjo & Raitt 1993; Whitford 1997) .",

Because grassland loss in the Chihuahuan Desert can be difficult or impossible to reverse (Bestelmeyer et al. 2009 ); however, diligent efforts must be made to preserve existing grassland states if they are to be represented at all. The current distribution of habitat types likely overrepresents shrub-dominated habitat, so shrub removal treatments may help to sustain regional bird diversity by favoring some grassland specialist species. Our interpretation of shrub-removal efforts for the Chihuahuan Desert contrasts with that of Kutt and Martin (2010) for north-eastern Australian woodlands. These authors concluded that the majority of bird species predicted to decline with increasing vegetation density were open habitat-specialists that were increasing in abundance at a national scale. In our case, however, bird species associated with open grassland habitats are declining regionally (Sauer et al. 2012) . Thus, interpretations about the effects of woody plant removal on bird diversity depend strongly on regional species pools and land change history.",

BISA is able to integrate the concentration of abundance (exclusivity) and frequency of occurrence (fidelity) to produce a robust measure of habitat associations of species that does not depend on normality assumptions (Dufr\u00eane & Legendre 1997). A subset of 26 common species for the 16 pairs sampled in 2010 and 30 common species detected on the 21 pairs sampled in 2011 were used for BISA. We also used a traditional indicator species analysis designed for unpaired grouping (Indicator Species Analysis [ISA]; PC-ORD version 6; McCune & Mefford 2011a) for all areas sampled in 2011, including unpaired treated and grassland areas.",
