The author further goes on to say that rigorous evaluation and quality assurance of online mental health services is not done in low and middle income (LAMI) countries. In this letter, we wish to highlight a couple of issues that are relevant to existing online mental health services in India and its applicability/acceptability during COVID 19 pandemic.",

However, the utility has remained minimal as there were no guidelines and laws about the use of telemedicine in clinical practice. Tele psychiatry services specifically saw the first surge during the devastating tsunami of 2004, when services were provided to people of coastal areas of Tamil Nadu (Thara and Sujit, 2013) . Today we have another such natural disaster COVID-19, which has brought the country to standstill with no modes of transportation available whatsoever. Fortunately, we have significant technological advancement to implement tele-psychiatry.",

            "text": "As a parallel developments to the above, the Telemedicine Centre of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, has been pioneering the use of tele-psychiatry for clinical services. For example, Das et al. have shown that synchronous mode of direct video consultation is feasible, acceptable, clinically effective and saves considerable amount of money and travel time (Das et al., 2020) . Two other studies coming from the same centre have shown that more than 80 % of stable patients can be managed with teleconsultation alone (Agarwal et al., 2019; Gowda et al., 2018) . These findings indicate that synchronous direct video consultation based follow-ups are feasible and acceptable for clinically stable patients with a known psychiatric disorder. Since the past three years, the centre has carried out more than 800 direct video-consultations (non-emegency follow-up cases) without any hiccough. Lastly, provision also is made for first time consultation for mental health issues. In March 2020, Medical Council of India has released guidelines for telemedicine practice. The guideline has given the freedom to clinicians to use their judgment in deciding when teleconsultation is appropriate and has also simplified the procedure for obtaining consent (BOARD OF GOVERN-ERS In supersession of the Medical Council of India, 2020).",
