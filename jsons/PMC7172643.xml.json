IL-22 acts biology function via the signal transduction in immune response by heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2 (Witte et al., 2010). In combined with receptor complex, IL-22 activates the receptor-associated Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, and then leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (Lejeune et al., 2002). IL-22 has been described as the cytokine of epithelium protection, which has been widely studied for its different effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular defense and inflammation (Lindemans et al., 2015). Especially, IL-22 in the gut is able to stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides, enhance the intestinal epithelial barrier of mucus and promote intestinal repair (Hou et al., 2018; Parks et al., 2015). Pathogens such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and mycotoxin in contaminated feed are destructive to intestinal epithelial cells, which cause enteritis and seriously threatens gut health of pigs (Alizadeh et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin of the trichothecenes family that is one of the most common mycotoxin in animal feed (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). Pigs are the most sensitive species to DON, which can cause abdominal distress, diarrhea, vomiting and even shock or death (Pinton and Oswald, 2014). Besides, DON can induce apoptosis and breakdown intestinal barrier integrity in epithelial cells (Akbari et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2012), which increases the susceptibility of animals to intestinal pathogen infection (Antonissen et al., 2014). Besides feeds, enteropathogens, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88, commonly induce diarrhea in piglets, which cause mortality and reduce growth rate, resulting in heavy economic losses (Jin and Zhao, 2000). Recent studies demonstrated that IL-22 could effectively suppress infection of several intestinal viruses through activation of STAT3 signaling (Xue et al., 2017).Moreover, IL-22 also activated STAT3 to induce the expressions of transcription factors, such as Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog, and promoted tumor progression in human colorectal cancer cells (Koltsova and Grivennikov, 2014; Kryczek et al., 2014). However, IL-22-STAT3 pathway plays a protective role in intestinal epithelium during colitis by promoting expression of genes involved in apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and survival (Akira, 2000; Chung et al., 2006). Studies have shown that STAT3 activation in intestinal epithelial is protective of mucosal wound healing and (Pickert et al., 2009; Sugimoto et al., 2008). Previous researches reported that IL-22 could modulate antimicrobial peptides production to guarantee barrier functions (Mulcahy et al., 2016; Sovran et al., 2015; Treerat et al., 2017). However, it is still unclear whether porcine IL-22 has a protective role against intestinal epithelial damage.",

Combined with its safety on cell viability and balance proinflammatory cytokines expressions, rIL-22 is a novel idea to cure the vomit and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells induced by toxin.",

ETEC K88, is a vital pathogens, which caused serious intestinal disorder in piglets. IL-22 mainly actives STAT3 signal pathway that related to suppress apoptosis to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function, ameliorate intestinal inflammation and prevent infection of gastrointestinal bacteria via regulation of antimicrobial peptides expression (Wittkopf et al., 2015). Porcine intestinal epithelial cells could produce \u03b2-defensin to maintain the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier (Mariani et al., 2009). \u03b2-defensin attenuated intestinal inflammation and mucosal lesions in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis and displayed broad antimicrobial activity against pathogenic intestinal bacteria (Veldhuizen et al., 2008; Wittkopf et al., 2015). In our experiment, we found that rIL-22 significantly improved the expression of pBD-1 against the infection of ETEC K88, although the increase of pBD-2 was not obvious at statistical level. Researches showed that pBD-1 had a strong inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, C. albicans and B. pertussis (Elahi et al., 2006; Shi et al., 1999). It\u2019s possible that rIL-22 decreased the adhesion of ETEC K88 via antibacterial effect of pBD-1.",
