            "text": "Neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation represents an emerging therapeutic approach to treat several neurological disorders. NPC transplants into rodent models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury have demonstrated clinical benefits (Blurton-Jones et al., 2009, Cummings et al., 2005, van Gorp et al., 2013). Further, NPCs have been suggested as a potential treatment for the neuroinflammatory autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) as they represent attractive sources for the generation of myelin-competent oligodendrocytes (Ben-Hur et al., 1998, Brustle et al., 1999). NPC-derived glial progenitors have been shown to remyelinate axons following transplantation into regions of acute experimental demyelination (Ben-Hur et al., 1998, Keirstead et al., 1999). In addition, transplantation of neural precursors into a rodent autoimmune model of demyelination resulted in migration of transplanted cells into white matter tracts accompanied by an improvement in clinical outcome (Ben-Hur et al., 2003, Pluchino et al., 2003). In these pre-clinical autoimmune models of MS, NPCs have been suggested to act as modulators of the immune system or directly replace damaged or lost endogenous NPCs that subsequently allows for dampening disease progression, axonal preservation and remyelination (Aharonowiz et al., 2008, Pluchino et al., 2009, Pluchino et al., 2003).",

            "text": "An important and clinically relevant question is whether transplanted NPCs can alleviate demyelination caused by persistent viral infection. Although the cause of MS has been attributed to multiple factors, viruses have long been considered as a potential triggering agent for MS in genetically susceptible individuals (Gilden, 2005, Olson et al., 2005). Therefore, it is important to study the remyelination potential of NPCs in the context of virally-induced neurologic disease, as this will give important insights into whether cell replacement therapies are effective within the CNS where neurotropic viruses may be persistent. With this in mind, we have previously shown that engraftment of postnatal-derived NPCs into the spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice with established demyelinating disease resulted in the selective colonization of demyelinating white matter tracts by transplanted cells accompanied by remyelination and axonal sparing (Carbajal et al., 2010, Carbajal et al., 2011, Totoiu et al., 2004; Greenberg et al., 2014). In a clinical setting, NPCs derived from donor-specific iPSCs may be preferable since these cells will retain the genetic background of the donor and potentially bypass the need for immunosuppressive drugs that leave the patient susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumor formation.",

            "text": "There are several known neurotropic viruses that are capable of infecting and replicating in both NPCs and NPC-derived cells (Chucair-Elliott et al., 2014, Huang et al., 2014, Schaumburg et al., 2008). For example, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects NPCs resulting in diminished numbers leading to loss of neuroblasts upon differentiation (Chucair-Elliott et al., 2014). NPCs are also susceptible to infection by Enterovirus 71, which causes depletion of their numbers via viral-induced lysis (Huang et al., 2014). In addition, hESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are highly susceptible to infection by JC virus, the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (Schaumburg et al., 2008). Coxsackievirus, another virus capable of infecting the CNS, also preferentially replicates in NPCs causing cell death and leading to developmental defects (Ruller et al., 2012). Most recently, Zika virus has been shown in culture to infect human NPCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and is linked to fetal abnormalities in pregnant woman exposed to the virus (Tang et al., 2016), while the human coronavirus OC43 was linked to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis within a SCID patient that received a cord-blood transplantation (Morfopoulou et al., 2016). Dampened immune surveillance resulting from treatment with immunosuppressive drugs can cause re-emergence of persistent neurotropic viruses which have the ability to infect and diminish numbers of transplanted cells, thus muting therapeutic benefits. Collectively, these findings suggest that susceptibility of NPCs to infection by neurotropic viruses is clinically important and must be evaluated before considering NPCs as a viable cell replacement therapy for various neurological disorders.",

There are two alleles for murine CEACAM1: mCeacam1a and mCeacam1b and inbred strains of mice such as C57BL/6 and Balb/c are homozygous for mCeacam1a and are highly susceptible to infection by JHMV (Williams et al., 1991). CEACAM1a is widely expressed in a variety of mouse tissue and can be detected on the surface of epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, endothelial cells and also on hematopoietic cells (Hemmila et al., 2004). We have recently shown that cultured NPCs derived from 1-day old C57BL/6 mice express CEACAM1a as determined by CEACAM1 mRNA transcripts as well as surface protein expression (Plaisted et al., 2014). In order to determine whether NPCs derived from iPSCs express CEACAM1a similar to GFP-NPCs, cell surface expression of the receptor was evaluated by staining NPCs with an anti-CEACAM1 antibody. GFP-NPCs and mixed splenocytes from C57BL/6 were used as controls. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that iPSC-NPCs expressed low levels of surface expression of CEACAM1 compared to GFP-NPCs (\nFig. 3A, B). Furthermore, qPCR analysis of mRNA isolated from cultured iPSC-NPCs revealed a significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in CEACAM1a transcripts compared to mRNA isolated from GFP-NPCs or splenocyte controls (Fig. 3C). Collectively, we interpret these findings to indicate iPSC-NPCs express proportionally less CEACAM1a compared to GFP-NPCs.",

These studies demonstrates that although iPSC-NPCs are functionally similar to postnatally-derived NPCs in their ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons, they are unique with respect to susceptibility to viral infection and expression of MHC class I on the cell surface. iPSC-NPCs express low levels of the JHMV receptor CEACAM1a, providing reduced susceptibility and limited replication. Furthermore, due to the impaired ability of virus to enter these cells and replicate, the cells are resistant to virus-induced cell death. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that after 72 h following infection of iPSC-NPCs there is an increase in cell death yet viral titers remain relatively low. These findings argue that iPSC-NPCs may be susceptible to JHMV-induced death over time due to mechanism(s) as of yet undefined and this is a focus of ongoing investigation.",

However, fetal-derived GFP-NPCs are susceptible to JHMV infection and undergo virus-induced cell death in vitro (Plaisted et al., 2014). Additionally, when engrafted into JHMV-infected mice, these cells are susceptible to infection in vivo (Weinger et al., 2014). Within the context of myelinopathies, this suggests that engrafting cells susceptible to persistent neurotropic viruses may be ineffective, as viral infection could prevent them from surviving and differentiating into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. Since iPSC-NPCs express low levels of the viral receptor and are resistant to virus-induced cell death, they will presumably persist in vivo, providing increased potential for oligodendrocyte differentiation and subsequent remyelination. Ultimately, iPSC-NPCs may offer a better cell-replacement option to postnatal GFP-NPCs in the context of JHMV-mediated demyelination.",

In order to successfully employ NPCs for axon remyelination in the damaged CNS, it is imperative to consider the possibility that transplanted NPCs will be targeted by persistent CNS viruses. In a clinical setting, if donor-derived human NPCs are used for treatment of MS or any other neurological disease, the recipient will likely be under general immunosuppression drugs to prevent rejection of the engrafted MHC-mismatched cells. However, systemic immunosuppression can lead to recrudescence of dormant neurotropic viruses, typically kept in check by immune surveillance. Consequently, engrafted NPCs may be targeted by reactivated neurotropic viruses, which can infect and proliferate in NPCs, causing cell death and diminishing therapeutic benefit. Since iPSC-NPCs are \u2018self-derived\u2019 and maintain the genetic background of the donor, they are unlikely to be rejected by the host. iPSC-NPCs are functionally similar to GFP-NPCs in their capacity to differentiate into remyelination-competent oligodendrocytes, suggesting that they may be therapeutically similar to engrafting GFP-NPCs. Indeed, a recent study showed that intraspinal transplantation of NPCs derived from mouse iPSCs alleviates clinical and pathological symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Laterza et al., 2013). Our findings argue that engraftment of an NPC population lacking specific receptors for known neurotropic viruses may reduce the risk of infection and cytopathic effects leading to more sustained clinical recovery. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are currently testing this hypothesis.",
