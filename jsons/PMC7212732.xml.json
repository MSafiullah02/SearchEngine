The informal sector provides food in affordable unit sizes, provides food on credit, sells fresh produce at lower costs than supermarket fresh produce and sells prepared foods appropriate for households that experience income, time, storage and energy poverty (Battersby et al. 2016).",

Foreign owned spazas (about 80% of all spazas) have been most targeted (Githahu 2020).",
