Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM), or sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), is an increasingly recognized form of transient cardiac dysfunction in the septic patients. Despite implications for patient outcomes, the critical care community has not given significant emphasis on this syndrome and prominent critical care textbooks [4, 5] do not have dedicated sections on SICM.",

A more recent Korean study evaluated baseline risk factors for the development of SICM and stress-induced cardiomyopathy compared with controls. Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing heart failure, and elevated proBNP were all associated with increased odds ratio for septic cardiomyopathy [8]. Again, there is some discrepancy between these studies that may be based on patient population (Japanese vs Korean, respectively), but both cite pre-existing heart failure as a risk factor. It should also be noted that in both studies, SICM was defined as an \u201cEF [ejection fraction] < 50% and a \u2265 10% decrease in the patient\u2019s baseline LVEF\u201d [8]. It is possible that patients with RV failure, diastolic dysfunction, and abnormal cardiac strain were missed as will be outlined more later on.",

While recent echocardiographic outcome prediction studies support these findings of LVEF [10, 11\u2022, 12], the strain of the myocardium (measured by echocardiographic speckle) was found to be a significant predictor of higher mortality in SICM [12\u2022]. Additionally, isolated RV dysfunction in sepsis was associated with worse 1-year survival [13]. A recent database study suggested that among patients with sepsis, echocardiographic assessment of the myocardium influenced hemodynamic management liberated patients from vasopressors earlier and decreased 28-day mortality [14\u2022]. In summary, LVEF is a poor diagnostic tool, and better measures, such as strain, do suggest that SICM portends a poorer prognosis and proper diagnosis will effect management to improve mortality.",

While it was initially thought that SICM was pathologically akin to coronary artery disease, a landmark study showed that the gross coronary perfusion is actually increased in patients with established septic shock [16]. Since these trials, many myocardial depressant factors have been identified including cytokines, components of the complement cascade, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns, oxidative stress, altered nitric oxide metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal calcium movement within cells, myocyte apoptosis, and autonomic dysregulation [17, 18\u2022]. Furthermore, the endothelial glycocalyx [19] is shed in sepsis causing vascular leak, coagulation, and inflammation and is associated with adverse outcomes [20]. Once disrupted, the endothelium can cause heterogeneous microvascular flow and myocardial edema [21] which is an underexplored mechanism of SICM. A very recent study [21] used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and histology to show that myocardial edema may in part explain the rise of cardiac troponin seen in SICM.",

A 2019 meta-analysis concluded that new onset atrial fibrillation occurs in patients without traditional risk factors for the development of AF suggestive that sepsis-induced cardiac changes lead to AF [24]. While the correlative relationship suggested by these studies links AF with SICM via a similar pathophysiology, it does not lend itself to using AF as a diagnostic or prognostic tool. It is also worth noting that approximately 2% of patients with fever have a fever-induced, type I Brugada pattern in the ECG, [25] a finding which may be confused with ST elevation due to myocardial ischemia. This is 20 times more common among febrile patients, compared with non-febrile patients [25].

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of approximately 1000 patients with sepsis and septic shock showed that N-terminal pro-B-type BNP (NT-proBNP) and cTn were elevated in 97.4% and 84.5% of patients, respectively. The degree of biomarker elevation was highly correlated with the development of septic shock and mortality, but NT-proBNP predicted mortality in the ICU and at 90 days better than cTn [17]. Elevation of natriuretic peptides is so ubiquitous in sepsis that some investigators argue that any association with increased mortality is weakened when illness severity is considered [10].",

Norepinephrine has stronger alpha-adrenergic profile compared with beta-1 which results in increased afterload more than increased myocardial function. While this is essential for the treatment of distributive shock, increasing afterload will drop cardiac output and could result in the \u201cunmasking\u201d of cardiac dysfunction. While epinephrine and dopamine have more favorable alpha to beta-1 adrenergic activity profiles, they are consequently associated with more arrhythmias. In the case of dopamine, risk of arrhythmias and potential increased mortality has led to the recommendation against its use for septic shock. It is worth noting that these guidelines did not identify patients with SICM and are guides for the management of septic shock in general. There are no trials that we could find to validate adopting these guidelines to patients with SICM [57]. There was one study which showed that phenylephrine improved cardiac function in septic rats and inhibited myocyte apoptosis suggesting that this could be used specifically for SICM, but there are no corresponding human studies [58]. The risk of isolated alpha-vasoconstriction without any beta-1 could cause increased afterload and decreased CO potentially worsening hemodynamics so further studies are needed.",

This effect is likely to be more dramatic in patients with septic cardiomyopathy because of abnormal Frank\u2013Starling relationships. It is necessary to be judicious with fluid management after the initial resuscitation phase by using dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness such as pulse pressure variation, inferior vena cava collapse, passive straight leg raise, and end-expiratory occlusion. While each of these measures has strengths and weakness, the overarching goal of these measures is to account for differences in cardiac function as it relates to fluid responsiveness in a dynamic manner rather than traditional static measures (i.e., CVP, PCWP). Currently the PETAL Network is recruiting for the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) to further evaluate this topic.

Further, a retrospective study by Wilkman et al. showed an increased 90-day mortality in patients with septic shock treated with inotropes [65]. Only a correlation, however, can be surmised from that study which may be representative of worse prognosis with septic cardiomyopathy. This seems to be supported by trials by Rhodes and Kumar in which they showed failure of cardiac output to increase with dobutamine portends a poorer prognosis [66, 67]. Two other interesting studies on potential pitfalls of dobutamine are done by Lyte suggesting that dobutamine facilitates biofilm formation on indwelling catheters in vitro and one by Hartemink in which dobutamine is associated with increased circulating TNF-alpha levels [68, 69].",

Moreover, it acts in a catecholamine-independent manner to minimize effects on oxygen demand, arrhythmias, and catecholamine resistance from sepsis. Morelli et al. performed a randomized, prospective trial published in 2005 which showed levosimendan improved hemodynamics (LVEF + CI) in patients not responsive to dobutamine at 5 microg/kg/min because of adrenergic hyporesponsiveness. They also showed that levosimendan increased gastric mucosal flow, creatinine clearance, urine output, and lactate clearance compared with dobutamine [72]. A meta-analysis (of 7 trials) by Zangrillo published in 2015 showed that levosimendan had a mortality benefit when compared to dobutamine [73]. The next major trial to come out was the LeoPARDS trial in 2016. This double-blind RCT compared levosimendan to placebo plus standard of care for sepsis and found no difference in SOFA scores or mortality but a trend toward worse mortality with levosimendan. In addition, the levosimendan group was more likely to have SVT, required higher vasopressor doses, and was less likely to be weaned from ventilator. Of note, in the placebo arm, less than 10% of patients received inotropic support, which does bring into question the prevalence of SICM in the study population [74\u2022]. Overall, the data for levosimendan is mixed, and the LeoPARDS trial should give practitioners pause before adopting its use broadly.",

It would seem that any negative inotropic effects would be detrimental to a patient who is relying on a hyperdynamic state, but this increased adrenergic state seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy. For this reason, the use of selective beta-blockers may help to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, increase diastolic filling, and ultimately improve septic cardiomyopathy. Early studies showed that esmolol did not change lactate and reduced TNF-alpha levels, and that beta-1 selective agents may have anti-inflammatory effects [75, 76]. An observational study of 9465 cases of sepsis found that patients prescribed with beta-blockers prior to admission had a significantly lower mortality (17.7% vs 22.1%) [77]. This sparked interest in prospective studies, the largest of which was performed by Morelli; they performed a non-blinded RCT which showed that the use of esmolol targeting a heart rate of 80\u201394 increased stroke volume and reduced vasopressor requirement. They also found an improved 28-day survival, but they were not powered for this outcome, and mortality in the placebo group was 80% which is much higher than expected [78\u2022].

These studies showed a significant improvement in blood pressure and decreased requirement for vasopressors but no difference in other outcomes [81\u201383]. There is only one case report describing the successful use of MB specifically for septic cardiomyopathy in a burn patient by Schlesinger in 2016 [84]. Like all therapies, MB is not without risks; it can contribute to serotonin syndrome, worsening arterial oxygenation (through pulmonary vasoconstriction), infiltration injury, and impaired mesenteric blood flow.

There are many potential therapies being investigated in the laboratory setting, largely in animal models of septic cardiomyopathy. Potential therapies include statins, dexmedetomidine, hydrocortisone, alpha-2 blockers, yohimbine, Chinese yam, erythropoietin, vitamin c, and sulfur dioxide among others [85\u201396]. As these treatments transition from the bench to the bedside, potential therapeutic efficacy will need to be evaluated. It is important to remember from historical studies in sepsis in the 1990\u2019s that translation of animal models to human studies has its limitations [85].",

A summary of the basic pathophysiology, work-up, and management of SICM is provided in Fig. 2. Clinicals should consider the diagnosis in patients with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and particularly septic shock requiring vasopressor therapy. Biomarkers can provide prognostic information and put SICM on the clinician\u2019s radar, but their diagnostic utility is limited. Echocardiography is currently the gold standard of diagnosis, and evaluation of global longitudinal strain is more sensitive and specific for SICM than LVEF or other common findings alone. Standard management includes the use of vasopressors, inotropes, and judicious fluid resuscitation, but large studies validating these measures are lacking. Additionally, while there is growing evidence for other therapies for SICM, more data is needed to make any definitive recommendations about adopting them to everyday practice. Finally, a consensus statement on diagnostic criteria is currently lacking and is essential in future studies evaluating treatment.",
