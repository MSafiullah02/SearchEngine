Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis plus sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion (Tables 1, 2) [6]. Throughout this manuscript and the performance improvement bundles, which are included, a distinction is made between definitions and therapeutic targets or thresholds. Sepsis-induced hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <70 mmHg or a SBP decrease >40 mmHg or less than two standard deviations below normal for age in the absence of other causes of hypotension. An example of a therapeutic target or typical threshold for the reversal of hypotension is seen in the sepsis bundles for the use of vasopressors. In the bundles, the MAP threshold is \u226565 mmHg. The use of definition versus threshold will be evident throughout this article. Septic shock is defined as sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion is defined as infection-induced hypotension, elevated lactate, or oliguria.\n\n",

Keeping the rating of quality of evidence and strength of recommendation explicitly separate constitutes a crucial and defining feature of the GRADE approach. This system classifies quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), low (grade C), or very low (grade D). Randomized trials begin as high-quality evidence but may be downgraded due to limitations in implementation, inconsistency, or imprecision of the results, indirectness of the evidence, and possible reporting bias (Table 3). Examples of indirectness of the evidence include population studied, interventions used, outcomes measured, and how these relate to the question of interest. Well-done observational (nonrandomized) studies begin as low-quality evidence, but the quality level may be upgraded on the basis of a large magnitude of effect. An example of this is the quality of evidence for early administration of antibiotics.

The assignment of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. The committee assessed whether the desirable effects of adherence would outweigh the undesirable effects, and the strength of a recommendation reflects the group\u2019s degree of confidence in that assessment. Thus, a strong recommendation in favor of an intervention reflects the panel\u2019s opinion that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation (beneficial health outcomes; lesser burden on staff and patients; and cost savings) will clearly outweigh the undesirable effects (harm to health; more burden on staff and patients; and greater costs). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were taken into account. A weak recommendation in favor of an intervention indicates the judgment that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably will outweigh the undesirable effects, but the panel is not confident about these tradeoffs\u2014either because some of the evidence is low quality (and thus uncertainty remains regarding the benefits and risks) or the benefits and downsides are closely balanced. A strong recommendation is worded as \u201cwe recommend\u201d and a weak recommendation as \u201cwe suggest.\u201d",

Subgroups agreed electronically on draft proposals that were then presented for general discussion among subgroup heads, the SSC Steering Committee (two co-chairs, two co-vice chairs, and an at-large committee member), and several selected key committee members who met in July 2011 in Chicago. The results of that discussion were incorporated into the next version of recommendations and again discussed with the whole group using electronic mail. Draft recommendations were distributed to the entire committee and finalized during an additional nominal group meeting in Berlin in October 2011. Deliberations and decisions were then recirculated to the entire committee for approval. At the discretion of the chairs and following discussion, competing proposals for wording of recommendations or assigning strength of evidence were resolved by formal voting within subgroups and at nominal group meetings. The manuscript was edited for style and form by the writing committee with final approval by subgroup heads and then by the entire committee. To satisfy peer review during the final stages of manuscript approval for publication, several recommendations were edited with approval of the SSC executive committee group head for that recommendation and the EBM lead.",

Although there are limitations to CVP as a marker of intravascular volume status and response to fluids, a low CVP generally can be relied upon as supporting positive response to fluid loading. Either intermittent or continuous measurements of oxygen saturation were judged to be acceptable. During the first 6 h of resuscitation, if Scvo\n2 less than 70 % or Svo\n2 equivalent of less than 65 % persists with what is judged to be adequate intravascular volume repletion in the presence of persisting tissue hypoperfusion, then dobutamine infusion (to a maximum of 20 \u03bcg kg\u22121 min\u22121) or transfusion of packed red blood cells to achieve a hematocrit of greater than or equal to 30 % in attempts to achieve the Scvo\n2 or Svo\n2 goal are options.

Similar consideration may be warranted in circumstances of increased abdominal pressure [17]. Elevated CVP may also be seen with preexisting clinically significant pulmonary artery hypertension, making use of this variable untenable for judging intravascular volume status. Although the cause of tachycardia in septic patients may be multifactorial, a decrease in elevated pulse rate with fluid resuscitation is often a useful marker of improving intravascular filling. Published observational studies have demonstrated an association between good clinical outcome in septic shock and MAP \u226565 mmHg as well as Scvo\n2 \u226570 % (measured in the superior vena cava, either intermittently or continuously) [18]. Many studies support the value of early protocolized resuscitation in severe sepsis and sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion [19\u201324]. Studies of patients with shock indicate that Svo\n2 runs 5\u20137 % lower than Scvo\n2 [25]. While the committee recognized the controversy surrounding resuscitation targets, an early quantitative resuscitation protocol using CVP and venous blood gases can be readily established in both emergency department and ICU settings [26]. Recognized limitations to static ventricular filling pressure estimates exist as surrogates for fluid resuscitation [27, 28], but measurement of CVP is currently the most readily obtainable target for fluid resuscitation. Targeting dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness during resuscitation, including flow and possibly volumetric indices and microcirculatory changes, may have advantages [29\u201332]. Available technologies allow measurement of flow at the bedside [33, 34]; however, the efficacy of these monitoring techniques to influence clinical outcomes from early sepsis resuscitation remains incomplete and requires further study before endorsement.",

If Scvo\n2 is not available, lactate normalization may be a feasible option in the patient with severe sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion. Scvo\n2 and lactate normalization may also be used as a combined endpoint when both are available. Two multicenter randomized trials evaluated a resuscitation strategy that included lactate reduction as a single target or a target combined with Scvo\n2 normalization [35, 36]. The first trial reported that early quantitative resuscitation based on lactate clearance (decrease by at least 10 %) was noninferior to early quantitative resuscitation based on achieving Scvo\n2 of 70 % or more [35].

Sepsis screening tools have been developed to monitor ICU patients [37\u201341], and their implementation has been associated with decreased sepsis-related mortality [15].",

Improvement in care through increasing compliance with sepsis quality indicators is the goal of a severe sepsis performance improvement program [47]. Sepsis management requires a multidisciplinary team (physicians, nurses, pharmacy, respiratory, dieticians, and administration) and multispecialty collaboration (medicine, surgery, and emergency medicine) to maximize the chance for success. Evaluation of process change requires consistent education, protocol development and implementation, data collection, measurement of indicators, and feedback to facilitate the continuous performance improvement. Ongoing educational sessions provide feedback on indicator compliance and can help identify areas for additional improvement efforts. In addition to traditional continuing medical education efforts to introduce guidelines into clinical practice, knowledge translation efforts have recently been introduced as a means to promote the use of high-quality evidence in changing behavior [48]. Protocol implementation associated with education and performance feedback has been shown to change clinician behavior and is associated with improved outcomes and cost effectiveness in severe sepsis [19, 23, 24, 49]. In partnership with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, phase III of the SSC targeted the implementation of a core set (\u201cbundle\u201d) of recommendations in hospital environments where change in behavior and clinical impact were measured [50]. The SSC guidelines and bundles can be used as the basis of a sepsis performance improvement program.",

Samples can be refrigerated or frozen if processing cannot be performed immediately. Because rapid sterilization of blood cultures can occur within a few hours after the first antimicrobial dose, obtaining those cultures before therapy is essential if the causative organism is to be identified. Two or more blood cultures are recommended [51]. In patients with indwelling catheters (for more than 48 h), at least one blood culture should be drawn through each lumen of each vascular access device (if feasible, especially for vascular devices with signs of inflammation, catheter dysfunction, or indicators of thrombus formation). Obtaining blood cultures peripherally and through a vascular access device is an important strategy. If the same organism is recovered from both cultures, the likelihood that the organism is causing the severe sepsis is enhanced.",

A focused history can provide vital information about potential risk factors for infection and likely pathogens at specific tissue sites. The potential role of biomarkers for diagnosis of infection in patients presenting with severe sepsis remains undefined.

Prompt infusion of antimicrobial agents should also be a priority and may require additional vascular access ports [68, 69]. In the presence of septic shock, each hour delay in achieving administration of effective antibiotics is associated with a measurable increase in mortality in a number of studies [15, 68, 70\u201372]. Overall, the preponderance of data support giving antibiotics as soon as possible in patients with severe sepsis with or without septic shock [15, 68, 70\u201377]. The administration of antimicrobial agents with a spectrum of activity likely to treat the responsible pathogen(s) effectively within 1 h of the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock. Practical considerations, for example challenges with clinicians\u2019 early identification of patients or operational complexities in the drug delivery chain, represent unstudied variables that may impact achieving this goal. Future trials should endeavor to provide an evidence base in this regard. This should be the target goal when managing patients with septic shock, whether they are located within the hospital ward, the emergency department, or the ICU. The strong recommendation for administering antibiotics within 1 h of the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock, although judged to be desirable, is not yet the standard of care as verified by published practice data [15].",

The most common pathogens that cause septic shock in hospitalized patients are Gram-positive bacteria, followed by Gram-negative and mixed bacterial microorganisms. Candidiasis, toxic shock syndromes, and an array of uncommon pathogens should be considered in selected patients. An especially wide range of potential pathogens exists for neutropenic patients. Recently used anti-infective agents should generally be avoided.

Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend either fluconazole or an echinocandin. Empiric use of an echinocandin is preferred in most patients with severe illness, especially in those patients who have recently been treated with antifungal agents, or if Candida glabrata infection is suspected from earlier culture data. Knowledge of local resistance patterns to antifungal agents should guide drug selection until fungal susceptibility test results, if available, are performed.

Antibiotic choices should be guided by local prevalence patterns of bacterial pathogens and susceptibility data. Ample evidence exists that failure to initiate appropriate therapy (i.e., therapy with activity against the pathogen that is subsequently identified as the causative agent) correlates with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [68, 71, 79, 80]. Recent exposure to antimicrobials (within last 3 months) should be considered in the choice of an empiric antibacterial regimen. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock warrant broad-spectrum therapy until the causative organism and its antimicrobial susceptibilities are defined. Although a global restriction of antibiotics is an important strategy to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance and to reduce cost, it is not an appropriate strategy in the initial therapy for this patient population. However, as soon as the causative pathogen has been identified, de-escalation should be performed by selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial agent that covers the pathogen and is safe and cost-effective. Collaboration with antimicrobial stewardship programs, where they exist, is encouraged to ensure appropriate choices and rapid availability of effective antimicrobials for treating septic patients. All patients should receive a full loading dose of each agent. Patients with sepsis often have abnormal and vacillating renal or hepatic function, or may have abnormally high volumes of distribution due to aggressive fluid resuscitation, requiring dose adjustment. Drug serum concentration monitoring can be useful in an ICU setting for those drugs that can be measured promptly. Significant expertise is required to ensure that serum concentrations maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity [81, 82].",

Combination therapy used in this context connotes at least two different classes of antibiotics (usually a beta-lactam agent with a macrolide, fluoroquinolone, or aminoglycoside for select patients). A controlled trial suggested, however, that when using a carbapenem as empiric therapy in a population at low risk for infection with resistant microorganisms, the addition of a fluoroquinolone does not improve outcomes of patients [85]. A number of other recent observational studies and some small, prospective trials support initial combination therapy for selected patients with specific pathogens (e.g., pneumococcal sepsis, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens) [91\u201393], but evidence from adequately powered, randomized clinical trials is not available to support combination over monotherapy other than in septic patients at high risk of death. In some clinical scenarios, combination therapies are biologically plausible and are likely clinically useful even if evidence has not demonstrated improved clinical outcome [89, 90, 94, 95]. Combination therapy for suspected or known Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other multiresistant Gram-negative pathogens, pending susceptibility results, increases the likelihood that at least 1 drug is effective against that strain and positively affects outcome [88, 96].",

Foci of infection readily amenable to source control measures include an intra-abdominal abscess or gastrointestinal perforation, cholangitis or pyelonephritis, intestinal ischemia or necrotizing soft tissue infection, and other deep space infection, such as an empyema or septic arthritis. Such infectious foci should be controlled as soon as possible following successful initial resuscitation [106\u2013108], and intravascular access devices that are potentially the source of severe sepsis or septic shock should be removed promptly after establishing other sites for vascular access [109, 110].",

The role of SDD with systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis and its variants (e.g., SOD, CHG) has been a contentious issue ever since the concept was first developed more than 30 years ago. The notion of limiting the acquisition of opportunistic, often multiresistant, healthcare-associated microorganisms has its appeal by promoting \u201ccolonization resistance\u201d from the resident microbiome existing along mucosal surfaces of the alimentary tract. However, the efficacy of SDD, its safety, propensity to prevent or promote antibiotic resistance, and cost-effectiveness remain debatable despite a number of favorable meta-analyses and controlled clinical trials [115]. The data indicate an overall reduction in VAP but no consistent improvement in mortality, except in selected populations in some studies. Most studies do not specifically address the efficacy of SDD in patients who present with sepsis, but some do [116\u2013118].",

The CRYSTMAS study demonstrated no difference in mortality with HES versus 0.9 % normal saline (31 vs. 25.3 %, P = 0.37) in the resuscitation of septic shock patients; however, the study was underpowered to detect the 6 % difference in absolute mortality observed [122]. In a sicker patient cohort, a Scandinavian multicenter study in septic patients (6S Trial Group) showed increased mortality rates with 6 % HES 130/0.42 fluid resuscitation compared to Ringer\u2019s acetate (51 vs. 43 %. P = 0.03) [123]. The CHEST study, conducted in a heterogenous population of patients admitted to intensive care (HES vs. isotonic saline, n = 7000 critically ill patients), showed no difference in 90-day mortality between resuscitation with 6 % HES with a molecular weight of 130 kD/0.40 and isotonic saline (18 vs. 17 %, P = 0.26); the need for renal replacement therapy was higher in the HES group [7.0 vs. 5.8 %; relative risk (RR), 1.21; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.00\u20131.45; P = 0.04] [124]. A meta-analysis of 56 randomized trials found no overall difference in mortality between crystalloids and artificial colloids (modified gelatins, HES, dextran) when used for initial fluid resuscitation [125]. Information from 3 randomized trials (n = 704 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock) did not show survival benefit with use of heta-, hexa-, or pentastarches compared to other fluids (RR, 1.15; 95 % CI, 0.95\u20131.39; random effect; I2 = 0 %) [126\u2013128]. However, these solutions increased substantially the risk of acute kidney injury (RR, 1.60; 95 % CI, 1.26\u20132.04; I2 = 0 %) [126\u2013128]. The evidence of harm observed in the 6S and CHEST studies and the meta-analysis supports a high-level recommendation advising against the use of HES solutions in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, particularly since other options for fluid resuscitation exist. The CRYSTAL trial, another large prospective clinical trial comparing crystalloids and colloids, was recently completed and will provide additional insight into HES fluid resuscitation.",

            "text": "Vasopressor therapy is required to sustain life and maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension, even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. Below a threshold MAP, autoregulation in critical vascular beds can be lost, and perfusion can become linearly dependent on pressure. Thus, some patients may require vasopressor therapy to achieve a minimal perfusion pressure and maintain adequate flow [133, 134]. The titration of norepinephrine to a MAP as low as 65 mmHg has been shown to preserve tissue perfusion [134]. Note that the consensus definition of sepsis-induced hypotension for use of MAP in the diagnosis of severe sepsis is different (MAP <70 mmHg) from the evidence-based target of 65 mmHg used in this recommendation. In any case, the optimal MAP should be individualized as it may be higher in patients with atherosclerosis and/or previous hypertension than in young patients without cardiovascular comorbidity. For example, a MAP of 65 mmHg might be too low in a patient with severe uncontrolled hypertension; in a young, previously normotensive patient, a lower MAP might be adequate. Supplementing endpoints, such as blood pressure, with assessment of regional and global perfusion, such as blood lactate concentrations, skin perfusion, mental status, and urine output, is important. Adequate fluid resuscitation is a fundamental aspect of the hemodynamic management of patients with septic shock and should ideally be achieved before vasopressors and inotropes are used; however, using vasopressors early as an emergency measure in patients with severe shock is frequently necessary, as when diastolic blood pressure is too low. When that occurs, great effort should be directed to weaning vasopressors with continuing fluid resuscitation.",

Table 7 depicts a GRADEpro Summary of Evidence Table comparing dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of septic shock. Dopamine increases MAP and cardiac output, primarily due to an increase in stroke volume and heart rate. Norepinephrine increases MAP due to its vasoconstrictive effects, with little change in heart rate and less increase in stroke volume compared with dopamine. Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine and may be more effective at reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may be particularly useful in patients with compromised systolic function but causes more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine [148]. It may also influence the endocrine response via the hypothalamic pituitary axis and have immunosuppressive effects. However, information from five randomized trials (n = 1,993 patients with septic shock) comparing norepinephrine to dopamine does not support the routine use of dopamine in the management of septic shock [136, 149\u2013152]. Indeed, the relative risk of short-term mortality was 0.91 (95 % CI, 0.84\u20131.00; fixed effect; I2 = 0 %) in favor of norepinephrine.

            "text": "Although some human and animal studies suggest epinephrine has deleterious effects on splanchnic circulation and produces hyperlactatemia, no clinical evidence shows that epinephrine results in worse outcomes, and it should be the first alternative to norepinephrine. Indeed, information from 4 randomized trials (n = 540) comparing norepinephrine to epinephrine found no evidence for differences in the risk of dying (RR, 0.96; CI, 0.77\u20131.21; fixed effect; I2 = 0 %) [142, 147, 154, 155]. Epinephrine may increase aerobic lactate production via stimulation of skeletal muscles\u2019 \u03b22-adrenergic receptors and thus may prevent the use of lactate clearance to guide resuscitation. With its almost pure \u03b1-adrenergic effects, phenylephrine is the adrenergic agent least likely to produce tachycardia, but it may decrease stroke volume and is therefore not recommended for use in the treatment of septic shock except in circumstances where norepinephrine is: (a) associated with serious arrhythmias, or (b) cardiac output is known to be high, or (c) as salvage therapy when other vasopressor agents have failed to achieve target MAP [156]. Vasopressin levels in septic shock have been reported to be lower than anticipated for a shock state [157]. Low doses of vasopressin may be effective in raising blood pressure in patients, refractory to other vasopressors and may have other potential physiologic benefits [158\u2013163]. Terlipressin has similar effects but is long acting [164]. Studies show that vasopressin concentrations are elevated in early septic shock, but decrease to normal range in the majority of patients between 24 and 48 h as shock continues [165]. This has been called relative vasopressin deficiency because in the presence of hypotension, vasopressin would be expected to be elevated. The significance of this finding is unknown. The VASST trial, a randomized, controlled trial comparing norepinephrine alone to norepinephrine plus vasopressin at 0.03 U/min, showed no difference in outcome in the intent-to-treat population [166]. An a priori defined subgroup analysis demonstrated that survival among patients receiving <15 \u03bcg/min norepinephrine at the time of randomization was better with the addition of vasopressin; however, the pretrial rationale for this stratification was based on exploring potential benefit in the population requiring \u226515 \u03bcg/min norepinephrine. Higher doses of vasopressin have been associated with cardiac, digital, and splanchnic ischemia and should be reserved for situations where alternative vasopressors have failed [167]. Information from 7 trials (n = 963 patients with septic shock) comparing norepinephrine with vasopressin (or terlipressin) does not support the routine use of vasopressin or its analog terlipressin [93, 95, 97, 99, 159, 161, 164, 166, 168\u2013170]. Indeed, the relative risk of dying was 1.12 (95 % CI, 0.96\u20131.30; fixed effects; I2 = 0 %). However, the risk of supraventricular arrhythmias was increased with norepinephrine (RR, 7.25; 95 % CI, 2.30\u201322.90; fixed effect; I2 = 0 %). Cardiac output measurement targeting maintenance of a normal or elevated flow is desirable when these pure vasopressors are instituted.",

Septic patients who remain hypotensive after fluid resuscitation may have low, normal, or increased cardiac outputs. Therefore, treatment with a combined inotrope/vasopressor, such as norepinephrine or epinephrine, is recommended if cardiac output is not measured. When the capability exists for monitoring cardiac output in addition to blood pressure, a vasopressor, such as norepinephrine, may be used separately to target specific levels of MAP and cardiac output. Large prospective clinical trials, which included critically ill ICU patients who had severe sepsis, failed to demonstrate benefit from increasing oxygen delivery to supranormal targets by use of dobutamine [173, 174]. These studies did not specifically target patients with severe sepsis and did not target the first 6 h of resuscitation. If evidence of tissue hypoperfusion persists despite adequate intravascular volume and adequate MAP, a viable alternative (other than reversing underlying insult) is to add inotropic therapy.",

            "text": "The response of septic shock patients to fluid and vasopressor therapy seems to be an important factor in selection of patients for optional hydrocortisone therapy. One French multicenter RCT of patients in vasopressor-unresponsive septic shock (hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors for more than 60 min) showed significant shock reversal and reduction of mortality rate in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency [defined as postadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cortisol increase \u22649 \u03bcg/dL] [175]. Two smaller RCTs also showed significant effects on shock reversal with steroid therapy [176, 177]. In contrast, a large, European multicenter trial (CORTICUS) that enrolled patients without sustained shock and had a lower risk of death than the French trial failed to show a mortality benefit with steroid therapy [178]. Unlike the French trial that only enrolled shock patients with blood pressure unresponsive to vasopressor therapy, the CORTICUS study included patients with septic shock regardless of how the blood pressure responded to vasopressors; the study baseline (placebo) 28-day mortality rate was 61 and 31 %, respectively. The use of the ACTH test (responders and nonresponders) did not predict the faster resolution of shock. In recent years, several systematic reviews have examined the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in septic shock with contradictory results: Annane et al. [179] analyzed the results of 12 studies and calculated a significant reduction in 28-day mortality with prolonged low-dose steroid treatment in adult septic shock patients (RR, 0.84; 95 % CI, 0.72\u20130.97; P = 0.02). In parallel, Sligl and colleagues [180] used a similar technique, but only identified eight studies for their meta-analysis, six of which had a high-level RCT design with low risk of bias [181]. In contrast to the aforementioned review, this analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in mortality (RR, 1.00; 95 % CI, 0.84\u20131.18). Both reviews, however, confirmed the improved shock reversal by using low-dose hydrocortisone [180, 181]. A recent review on the use of steroids in adult septic shock underlined the importance of selection of studies for systematic analysis [181] and identified only 6 high-level RCTs as adequate for systematic review [175\u2013178, 182, 183]. When only these six studies are analyzed, we found that in \u201clow risk\u201d patients from three studies (i.e., those with a placebo mortality rate of less than 50 %, which represents the majority of all patients), hydrocortisone failed to show any benefit on outcome (RR 1.06). The minority of patients from the remaining three studies, who had a placebo mortality of greater than 60 %, showed a nonsignificant trend to lower mortality by using hydrocortisone.

Furthermore, no evidence of this distinction was observed between responders and nonresponders in a recent multicenter trial [178]. Random cortisol levels may still be useful for absolute adrenal insufficiency; however, for septic shock patients who suffer from relative adrenal insufficiency (no adequate stress response), random cortisol levels have not been demonstrated to be useful. Cortisol immunoassays may over- or underestimate the actual cortisol level, affecting the assignment of patients to responders or nonresponders [184]. Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis [185, 186]. Moreover, a subanalysis of the CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with an increased 28-day mortality rate [187]. An inappropriately low random cortisol level (<18 \u03bcg/dL) in a patient with shock would be considered an indication for steroid therapy along traditional adrenal insufficiency guidelines.",

Factors that may increase the bleeding risk and indicate the need for a higher platelet count are frequently present in patients with severe sepsis. Sepsis itself is considered to be a risk factor for bleeding in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.

The use of lung-protective strategies for patients with ARDS is supported by clinical trials and has been widely accepted, but the precise choice of tidal volume for an individual patient with ARDS may require adjustment for such factors as the plateau pressure achieved, the level of PEEP chosen, the compliance of the thoracoabdominal compartment, and the vigor of the patient\u2019s breathing effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high obligate minute ventilations, or short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes >6 mL/kg PBW as long as the plateau pressure can be maintained \u226430 cm H2O [242, 243]. The validity of this ceiling value will depend on the patient\u2019s effort, as those who are actively breathing generate higher transalveolar pressures for a given plateau pressure than patients who are passively inflated. Conversely, patients with very stiff chest walls may require plateau pressures >30 cmH2O to meet vital clinical objectives. A retrospective study suggested that tidal volumes should be lowered even with plateau pressures \u226430 cmH2O [244] as lower plateau pressures were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality [245].",

In such cases, hypercapnia that is otherwise not contraindicated (e.g., high intracranial pressure) and appears to be tolerated should be allowed.

This will increase Pao\n2 when PEEP is applied through either an endotracheal tube or a face mask [252\u2013254]. In animal experiments, avoidance of end-expiratory alveolar collapse helps minimize ventilator-induced lung injury when relatively high plateau pressures are in use. Three large multicenter trials using higher versus lower levels of PEEP in conjunction with low tidal volumes did not uncover benefit or harm [255\u2013257]. A meta-analysis using individual patient data showed no benefit in all patients with ARDS; however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (Pao\n2/Fio2 ratio \u2264200 mm Hg) had decreased mortality with the use of higher PEEP, whereas those with mild ARDS did not [258]. Two options are recommended for PEEP titration. One option is to titrate PEEP (and tidal volume) according to bedside measurements of thoracopulmonary compliance with the objective of obtaining the best compliance, reflecting a favorable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension [259]. The second option is to titrate PEEP based on severity of oxygenation deficit and guided by the Fio2 required to maintain adequate oxygenation [234, 255, 256]. A PEEP >5 cm H20 is usually required to avoid lung collapse [260]. The ARDSNet standard PEEP strategy is shown in Appendix 3. The higher PEEP strategy recommended for ARDS is shown in Appendix 4 and comes from the ALVEOLI trial [257].",

The application of transient sustained use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) appears to improve oxygenation in patients initially, but these effects can be transient [262]. Although selected patients with severe hypoxemia may benefit from recruitment maneuvers in conjunction with higher levels of PEEP, little evidence supports the routine use in all ARDS patients [262].

A fluid-conservative strategy to minimize fluid infusion and weight gain in patients with ARDS, based on either a central venous catheter (CVP <4 mmHg) or a PA catheter (pulmonary artery wedge pressure <8 mmHg), along with clinical variables to guide treatment, led to fewer days of mechanical ventilation and reduced length of ICU stay without altering the incidence of renal failure or mortality rates [299].

While studies limiting sedation have been performed in a wide range of critically ill patients, there is little reason to assume that septic patients will not derive benefit from this approach [305]. The use of protocols for sedation is one method to limit sedation use, and a randomized, controlled clinical trial found that protocolized sedation compared with usual care reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, lengths of stay, and tracheostomy rates [305]. Avoidance of sedation is another strategy. A recent observational study of 250 critically ill patients suggests that deep sedation is common in mechanically ventilated patients [306]. A randomized, controlled clinical trial found that patients treated with intravenous morphine boluses preferentially, had significantly more days without ventilation, shorter stay in ICU and hospital, than patients who received sedation (propofol and midazolam) in addition to morphine [307]. However, agitated delirium was more frequently detected in the intervention group. Although not specifically studied in patients with sepsis, the administration of intermittent sedation, daily sedative interruption, and systematic titration to a predefined endpoint have been demonstrated to decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation [284, 305, 308, 309]. Patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) must be individually assessed regarding discontinuation of sedative drugs because the neuromuscular blockade must first be reversed. The use of intermittent vs. continuous methods for the delivery of sedation in critically ill patients has been examined in an observational study of mechanically ventilated patients that showed that patients receiving continuous sedation had significantly longer durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital lengths of stay [310].",

A prospective, randomized controlled trial in 128 mechanically ventilated adults receiving continuous intravenous sedation demonstrated that a daily interruption in the continuous sedative infusion until the patient was awake decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay [310]. Although the patients did receive continuous sedative infusions in this study, the daily interruption and awakening allowed for titration of sedation, in effect making the dosing intermittent. In addition, a paired spontaneous awakening trial combined with a spontaneous breathing trial decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and 1-year mortality [284]. More recently, a multicenter randomized trial compared protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption in 423 critically ill mechanically ventilated medical and surgical patients [311]. There were no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or lengths of stay between the groups; and daily interruption was associated with higher daily opioid and benzodiazepines doses, as well as higher nurse workload. Additionally, a randomized prospective blinded observational study demonstrated that although myocardial ischemia is common in critically ill ventilated patients, daily sedative interruption is not associated with an increased occurrence of myocardial ischemia [312]. Regardless of sedation approach, early physical rehabilitation should be a goal [313].",

The RCTs studied mixed populations of surgical and medical ICU patients [128, 328\u2013332] and found that intensive insulin therapy did not significantly decrease mortality [128, 328\u2013332], whereas the NICE-SUGAR trial demonstrated an increased mortality [331].

Several meta-analyses confirmed that intensive insulin therapy was not associated with a mortality benefit in surgical, medical, or mixed ICU patients [333, 335, 337]. The meta-analysis by Griesdale and colleagues [334], using between-trial comparisons driven mainly by the 2001 study by van den Berghe et al.

Interestingly, the RCTs that reported [326, 337] compared intensive insulin therapy to high controls (180\u2013200 mg/dL) [OR 0.89 (0.73\u20131.09)], whereas those that did not demonstrate benefit [330\u2013332] compared intensive therapy to moderate controls (108\u2013180 mg/dL) [OR 1.14 (1.02 to \u22121.26)].

The NICE-SUGAR trial is the largest, most compelling study to date on glucose control in ICU patients given its inclusion of multiple ICUs and hospitals and a general patient population. Several medical organizations, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American College of Physicians, and Society of Critical Care Medicine, have published consensus statements for glycemic control of hospitalized patients [338\u2013341]. These statements usually targeted glucose levels between 140 and 180 mg/dL. As there is no evidence that targets between 140 and 180 mg/dL are different from targets of 110\u2013140 mg/dL, the recommendations use an upper target blood glucose \u2264180 mg/dL without a lower target other than hypoglycemia. Treatment should avoid hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL), hypoglycemia, and wide swings in glucose levels. The continuation of insulin infusions, especially with the cessation of nutrition, has been identified as a risk factor for hypoglycemia [332]. Balanced nutrition may be associated with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia [342]. Several studies have suggested that the variability in glucose levels over time is an important determinant of mortality [343\u2013345]. Hyperglycemia and glucose variability seem to be unassociated with increased mortality rates in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients [346, 347].",

Plasma glucose values by capillary point-of-care testing have been found to be inaccurate with frequent false elevations [349] over the range of glucose levels [350], but especially in the hypoglycemic [349, 351] and hyperglycemic ranges [351] and in hypotensive patients [352] or patients receiving catecholamines [353]. A review of 12 published insulin infusion protocols for critically ill patients showed wide variability in dose recommendations and variable glucose control [354]. This lack of consensus about optimal dosing of intravenous insulin may reflect variability in patient factors (severity of illness, surgical vs medical settings), or practice patterns (e.g., approaches to feeding, intravenous dextrose) in the environments in which these protocols were developed and tested. Alternatively, some protocols may be more effective than others, conclusion supported by the wide variability in hypoglycemia rates reported with protocols [128, 326\u2013333]. Thus, the use of established insulin protocols is important not only for clinical care but also for the conduct of clinical trials to avoid hypoglycemia, adverse events, and premature termination of trials before the efficacy signal, if any, can be determined. Several studies have suggested that computer-based algorithms result in tighter glycemic control with a reduced risk of hypoglycemia [355, 356]. Further study of validated, safe, and effective protocols for controlling blood glucose concentrations and variability in the severe sepsis population is needed.",

This absence of apparent benefit of one modality over the other persists even when the analysis is restricted to RCT studies [366]. To date, five prospective RCTs have been published [367\u2013371]; four found no significant difference in mortality [367\u2013371], whereas one found significantly higher mortality in the continuous treatment group [367], but imbalanced randomization had led to a higher baseline severity of illness in this group. When a multivariable model was used to adjust for severity of illness, no difference in mortality was apparent between the groups [367]. Most studies comparing modes of renal replacement in the critically ill have included a small number of patients and some major weaknesses (i.e., randomization failure, modifications of therapeutic protocol during the study period, combination of different types of continuous renal replacement therapies, small number of heterogeneous groups of enrollees). The most recent and largest RCT [371] enrolled 360 patients and found no significant difference in survival between the continuous and intermittent groups. Moreover, no evidence supports the use of continuous therapies in sepsis independent of renal replacement needs.",

The need to extrapolate from general, acutely ill patients to critically ill patients to septic patients downgrades the evidence. That the effect is pronounced and the data are robust somewhat mitigate against the extrapolation, leading to a grade B determination.

The Canadian Critical Care Trials Group compared UFH (5000 IU twice daily) to LMWH (dalteparin, 5000 IU once per day and a second placebo injection to ensure parallel-group equivalence) [392]. No statistically significant difference in asymptomatic DVTs was found between the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95 % CI, 0.68\u20131.23; P = 0.57), but the proportion of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism on CT scan, high-probability ventilation perfusion scan, or autopsy was significantly lower in the LMWH group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95 % CI, 0.30\u20130.88; P = 0.01).The study did not account for the use of other forms of LMWH. These data suggest that LMWH (dalteparin) is the treatment of choice over UFH administered twice daily in critically ill patients. Also, because the study included septic patients, the evidence supporting the use of dalteparin over twice daily UFH in critically ill, and perhaps septic, patients is strong. Similarly, a meta-analysis of acutely ill, general medical patients comparing UFH twice and thrice daily demonstrated that the latter regimen was more effective at preventing VTE, but twice daily dosing produced less bleeding [393]. Both critically ill and septic patients were included in these analyses, but their numbers are unclear. Nonetheless, the quality of evidence supporting the use of three times daily, as opposed to twice daily, UFH dosing in preventing VTE in acutely ill medical patients is high (A). However, comparing LMWH to twice daily UFH, or twice daily UFH to three times daily UFH, in sepsis requires extrapolation, downgrading the data. No data exist on direct comparison of LMWH to UFH administered three times daily, nor are there any studies directly comparing twice daily and thrice daily UFH dosing in septic or critically ill patients. Therefore, it is not possible to state that LMWH is superior to three times daily UFH or that three times daily dosing is superior to twice daily administration in sepsis. This downgrades the quality of the evidence and therefore the recommendation.",

[394] conducted a study of 120 critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) who received VTE prophylaxis with dalteparin 5,000 IU daily for between 4 and 14 days and had at least one trough anti-factor Xa level measured. None of the patients had bio-accumulation (trough anti-factor Xa level lower than 0.06 IU/mL). The incidence of major bleeding was somewhat higher than in trials of other agents, but most other studies did not involve critically ill patients, in whom the bleeding risk is higher. Further, bleeding did not correlate with detectable trough levels [394]. Therefore, we recommend that dalteparin can be administered to critically ill patients with acute renal failure (A). Data on other LMWHs are lacking. Consequently, these forms should probably be avoided or, if used, anti-factor Xa levels should be monitored (grade 2C). UFH is not renally cleared and is safe (grade 1A).",

A meta-analysis of 11 studies, including six RCTs, published in the Cochrane Library concluded that the combination of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis was superior to either modality alone in preventing DVT and was better than compression alone in preventing pulmonary embolism [398]. This analysis did not focus on sepsis or critically ill patients but included studies of prophylaxis after orthopedic, pelvic, and cardiac surgery. In addition, the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis varied, including UFH, LMWH, aspirin, and warfarin. Nonetheless, the minimal risk associated with compression devices lead us to recommend combination therapy in most cases. In very-high-risk patients, LMWH is preferred over UFH [392, 399\u2013401]. Patients receiving heparin should be monitored for development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. These recommendations are consistent with those developed by the American College of Chest Physicians [402].",

This benefit should be applicable to patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

The benefit of prevention of upper GI bleeding must be weighed against the potential (unproven) effect of increased stomach pH on a greater incidence of VAP and C. difficile infection [409, 412, 413]. (See Supplemental Digital Content 6, 7 and 8, Summary of Evidence Tables for effects of treatments on specific outcomes.) In an exploratory hypothesis, we considered (as did the authors of the meta-analysis) [411] the possibility of less benefit and more harm in prophylaxis among patients receiving enteral nutrition but decided to provide one recommendation while lowering the quality of evidence. The balance of benefits and risks may thus depend on the individual patient\u2019s characteristics as well as on the local epidemiology of VAP and C. difficile infections. The rationale for considering only suppression of acid production (and not sucralfate) is based on the study of 1,200 patients by Cook et al. [414] comparing H2 blockers and sucralfate. More recent meta-analyses provide low-quality evidence suggesting more effective GI bleeding protection with the use of proton pump inhibitors than with H2RA [415\u2013417]. Patients should be periodically evaluated for the continued need for prophylaxis.",

In four studies, no effect on mortality was seen [431\u2013434]; one reported fewer infectious complications [431], and the others reported increased diarrhea and gastric residuals [433, 434] and increased incidence of infectious complications with full caloric feeding [432]. In another study, mortality was greater with higher feeding, but differences in feeding strategies were modest and the sample size was small [435]. Therefore, evidence is insufficient to support an early target of full caloric intake and, indeed, some possibility of harm exists. Underfeeding (60\u201370 % of target) or trophic feeding (upper limit of 500 kcal) is probably a better nutritional strategy in the first week of severe sepsis/septic shock. This upper limit for trophic feeding is a somewhat arbitrary number, but based in part on the fact that the two recent studies used a range of 240\u2013480 kcal [433, 434]. Underfeeding/trophic feeding strategies did not exclude advancing diet as tolerated in those who improved quickly.",

Rather, the evidence is generated predominantly from surgical, burn, and trauma patients. None of the meta-analyses reports a mortality benefit with parenteral nutrition, except one suggesting parenteral nutrition may be better than late introduction of enteral nutrition [442]. Several suggested that parenteral nutrition had higher infectious complications compared both to fasting or intravenous glucose and to enteral nutrition [429, 431, 438, 439, 442]. Enteral feeding was associated with a higher rate of enteral complications (e.g., diarrhea) than parenteral nutrition [438]. The use of parenteral nutrition to supplement enteral feeding was also analyzed by Dhaliwal et al. [440], who also reported no benefit. The trial by Casaer et al. [444] reported that early initiation of parenteral nutrition led to longer hospital and ICU stays, longer duration of organ support, and higher incidence of ICU-acquired infection. One-fifth of patients had sepsis and there was no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effects across subgroups, including the sepsis subjects. Therefore, no studies suggest the superiority of TPN over enteral alone in the first 24 h. In fact, there is a suggestion that enteral nutrition may in fact be superior to TPN vis a vis infectious complications and possibly requirement for intensive care and organ support.",

Arginine availability is reduced in sepsis, which can lead to reduced nitric oxide synthesis, loss of microcirculatory regulation, and enhanced production of superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, arginine supplementation could lead to unwanted vasodilation and hypotension [452, 453]. Human trials of l-arginine supplementation have generally been small and reported variable effects on mortality [454\u2013457]. The only study in septic patients showed improved survival, but had limitations in study design [455]. Other studies suggested no benefit [449, 454, 455] or possible harm [455] in the subgroup of septic patients. Some authors found improvement in secondary outcomes in septic patients, such as reduced infectious complications [454, 455] and length of hospital stay [454], but the relevance of these findings in the face of potential harm is unclear.",

Two small studies on septic patients showed no benefit in mortality rates [467, 468] but a significant reduction in infectious complications [467] and a faster recovery of organ dysfunction [468]. Some previous individual studies and meta-analyses showed positive secondary outcomes, such as reduction in infectious morbidity [461, 462, 465] and organ dysfunction [462]. Beneficial effects were found mostly in trials using parenteral rather than enteral glutamine. However, recent and well-sized studies could not demonstrate a reduction of infectious complications [227] or organ dysfunction [465, 466], even with parenteral glutamine. An ongoing trial (REDOXS) of 1,200 patients will test both enteral and parenteral glutamine and antioxidant supplementation in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients [469].

The prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes produced from EPA/GLA are less potent than their arachidonic acid-derived equivalents, reducing the pro-inflammatory impact on the immune response [452, 453]. Three early studies were summarized in a meta-analysis that reported a significant mortality reduction, increased ventilator-free days, and reduced risk of new organ dysfunction [470]. However, only one study was in septic patients [471], none was individually powered for mortality [472, 473], and all three used a diet with high omega-6 lipid content in the control group, which is not the usual standard of care in the critically ill. The authors who first reported reduced mortality in sepsis [471] conducted a follow-up multicenter study and again found improvement in nonmortality outcomes, though notably with no demonstrable effect on mortality [474]. Other studies using enteral [475\u2013477] or parenteral [478\u2013480] fish oil failed to confirm these findings in general critical illness or acute lung injury.

            "text": "The majority of ICU patients receive full support with aggressive, life-sustaining treatments. Many patients with multiple organ system failure or severe neurologic injuries will not survive or will have a poor quality of life. Decisions to provide less-aggressive life-sustaining treatments or to withdraw life-sustaining treatments in these patients may be in the patient\u2019s best interest and may be what patients and their families desire [481]. Physicians have different end-of-life practices based on their region of practice, culture, and religion [482]. Although the outcome of intensive care treatment in critically ill patients may be difficult to prognosticate accurately, establishing realistic treatment goals is important in promoting patient-centered care in the ICU [483]. Models for structuring initiatives to enhance care in the ICU highlight the importance of incorporating goals of care along with the prognosis into treatment plans [484]. Additionally, discussing the prognosis for achieving the goals of care and level of certainty of prognosis has been identified as an important component of surrogate decision-making in the ICU [485, 486]. However, variations exist in the use of advanced care planning and integration of palliative and end-of-life care in the ICU, which can lead to conflicts that may threaten overall quality of care [487, 488]. The use of proactive family care conferences to identify advanced directives and treatment goals within 72 h of ICU admission promotes communication and understanding between the patient\u2019s family and the care team; improves family satisfaction; decreases stress, anxiety, and depression in surviving relatives; facilitates end-of-life decision making; and shortens length of stay for patients who die in the ICU [489\u2013494]. Clinical practice guidelines for support of the ICU patient and family promote: early and repeated care conferencing to reduce family stress and improve consistency in communication; open flexible visitation; family presence during clinical rounds and resuscitation; and attention to cultural and spiritual support [495]. Additionally, the integration of advanced care planning and palliative care focused on pain management, symptom control, and family support has been shown to improve symptom management and patient comfort, and to improve family communication [484, 490, 496].",

In those who desaturate despite administration of face mask oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen or nasopharyngeal CPAP can be used to increase functional residual capacity and reduce the work of breathing, allowing for establishment of intravenous or intraosseous access for fluid resuscitation and peripheral inotrope delivery [502, 503]. Drugs used for sedation have important side effects in these patients. For example, etomidate is associated with increased mortality in children with meningococcal sepsis because of adrenal suppression effect [504, 505]. Because attainment of central access is more difficult in children than adults, reliance on peripheral or intraosseous access can be substituted until and unless central access is available.",

Thus, fluid resuscitation is recommended for both normotensive and hypotensive children in hypovolemic shock [542\u2013554]. Because hepatomegaly and/or rales occur in children who are fluid overloaded, these findings can be helpful signs of hypervolemia. In the absence of these signs, large fluid deficits can exist, and initial volume resuscitation can require 40\u201360 mL/kg or more; however, if these signs are present, then fluid administration should be ceased and diuretics should be given.

This delay is often related to difficulty in attaining central access. In the initial resuscitation phase, inotrope/vasopressor therapy may be required to sustain perfusion pressure, even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. Children with severe sepsis can present with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance, high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance, or low cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance shock [555]. A child may move from one hemodynamic state to another. Vasopressor or inotrope therapy should be used according to the hemodynamic state [555]. Dopamine-refractory shock may reverse with epinephrine or norepinephrine infusion. In the case of extremely low systemic vascular resistance despite the use of norepinephrine, the use of vasopressin and terlipressin has been described in a number of case reports, yet evidence to support this in pediatric sepsis, as well as safety data, are still lacking. Indeed, two RCTs showed no benefit in outcome with use of vasopressin or terlipressin in children [556\u2013559]. Interestingly, while vasopressin levels are reduced in adults with septic shock, such levels seem to vary extensively in children. When vasopressors are used for refractory hypotension, the addition of inotropes is commonly needed to maintain adequate cardiac output [510, 511, 555].",
