It had been shown that viral RNA can be detected from the nasal and pharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, and blood plasma using RT\u2010PCR targeting the NP gene of the virus.\n2\n, \n4\n, \n6\n Before the Wuhan city\u2010wide shutdown, specimens for confirmatory tests had to be sent to China CDC, with a long turnaround time. Subsequently, several main tertiary care hospitals in Wuhan were authorized to perform the tests. Therefore, in the earlier stages of the outbreak, a very limited number of patients were tested and confirmed for the diagnosis. Since 25 January tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients, with a history of exposure, fever, and positive findings on chest CT. However, since only a limited number of tests can be offered each day due to limited supplies and lab facilities, only a portion of the targeted population received tests. For example, during the month of January 2020, only 1700 specimens were tested (media report by the hospital on WeChat, 1/29/2020), compared with the vast number of clinic patients during that period (between 22 January and 30 January alone, there were over 7000 visits to one of the designated fever clinic). This created a significant backlog, as many patients had to wait for days to receive a confirmation or exclusion of diagnosis. It also led to problems in real\u2010time reporting, causing artificial fluctuation in daily updates of new cases (Figure 2B). For example, as shown in Table 1, using data collected from the National Health Commission's daily updates,\n7\n on some dates, the change in the number of newly confirmed cases varies drastically. This cannot be explained by realistic changes in the speed of infection spread. Needless to say, the recorded figures of daily confirmed cases are likely underestimated.",

The IgM antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections. The requirement for specimen quality is less stringent than for RNA\u2010based assays. Whether viruses themselves are present in respiratory specimens, the presence of a specific antibody can be uniformly detected, avoiding false\u2010negative results due to sampling. Most importantly, with the regular 96\u2010well microplate, and automatic ELISA devices, the test capacity is greatly increased compared to RNA\u2010based molecular tests and can handle a large number of febrile patients such as in the current epidemic, with a quick turnaround time (2\u20103 hours). For example, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantavirus was endemic in Hubei Province, with a high annual incidence in the 1980s and 1990s. The rapid and specific etiologic diagnosis was critical for patient management and epidemic controls. An IgM\u2010capture ELISA was used to quickly screen all febrile patients effectively during those epidemic seasons.\n10\n, \n11\n Similarly, for the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCVP) situation, an IgM\u2010capture ELISA can offer earlier and more efficient confirmation or exclusion of the nCoV\u20102019 infection in patients with fever, thus adding to the accuracy of epidemiologic monitoring and facilitating proper isolation of patients.",

The scene was astonishing, with over a thousand of anxious patients with illnesses ranging from mild to severe, all lined up and waiting over 4 hours to be seen. The vast majority could be individuals without infection by nCoV\u20102019, yet all the protection they had was facial masks. One cannot imagine how much risk for cross infection can occur in such over\u2010crowded situations. If some rapid viral diagnostic tests were available, the situation would be completely different. Patients could quickly have blood drawn when they first arrive and wait elsewhere to receive the results. Or they could have blood drawn in their own communities (common residential areas called \u201cXiao Qu\u201d in Wuhan, as in most other cities) to avoid a trip to the clinics and high potential for nCoV\u20102019 exposure. Coincident with the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak is the season for several other common respiratory etiologies, such as influenza and the common cold. After the city\u2010wide shutdown and heightened public warning, there was a surge of clinic patients. Many patients would visit several clinics or the same clinic daily, trying to be selected for RNA tests. A significant number of them had symptoms or lab findings that are not consistent with NCVP, such as elevated lymphocytes and lack of chest CT findings. With a serological test, these patients could avoid the clinic visits.",
