In veterinary medicine, no standards have been established for the volume of blood that constitutes 1 unit. When a human blood collection system is used for dogs, 450 \u00b145 mL of blood is collected in 63 mL of anticoagulant and often is designated as 1 unit. Whole blood contains red blood cells, clotting factors, proteins, and platelets and is the product most commonly transfused into dogs and cats.38 Once whole blood is refrigerated, the white blood cells and platelets become nonfunctional. As a starting point, the dosage for whole blood is 10 to 22 mL/kg.",

If 450 mL of blood is collected, the volume of PRBCs obtained is approximately 200 mL. Because the plasma has been removed, the total volume transfused is less than 1 unit of whole blood but contains the same oxygen-carrying capacity as 450 mL of whole blood. In cats, the increase in packed cell volume (PCV) after transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs has been shown to be equivalent to the increase after transfusion of 1 unit of whole blood.48 PRBCs are used only to treat clinically symptomatic anemia because they do not contain platelets or clotting factors. Red blood cell transfusions are administered to cats for a variety of reasons. Data on 126 cats administered whole blood or PRBCs indicated 52% were transfused for blood loss anemia, 38% for erythropoietic failure, and 10% for hemolytic anemia.48 Similar reasons for transfusion of cats have been reported in Germany.90 Dogs more commonly are transfused for blood loss anemia (70%) with 14% to 22% being transfused for hemolytic anemia and 8% to 14% for erythropoietic failure.8, 45 The initial dosage of PRBCs is 6 to 10 mL/kg, and transfusion is continued until the clinical signs of anemia are improved.",

            "text": "Fresh frozen plasma is the plasma obtained from whole blood plus the anticoagulant, frozen within 8 hours of collection. When whole blood is centrifuged to produce plasma and PRBCs, the anticoagulant is collected in the plasma fraction. Fresh frozen plasma contains all clotting factors, which, if frozen at \u221230\u00b0 C in a blood bank freezer, maintain activity for 12 months.85 Fresh frozen plasma maintained in an upright freezer at \u221220\u00b0 C maintains clotting factor activity for 6 months. When frozen, the plastic storage bag becomes brittle and if not carefully handled can crack, rendering the plasma unusable. For this reason, plasma is stored in special boxes to protect the plastic bag and must be handled carefully before transfusion. Fresh frozen plasma has been used to treat a wide variety of clinical patients. A retrospective analysis of fresh frozen plasma usage in dogs identified multiple indications for administration of fresh frozen plasma, including replacement of coagulation factors, albumin, \u03b12-macroglobulin, and immunoglobulin despite the recommendation that fresh frozen plasma should not be used as a source of albumin, for volume expansion, or nutritional support.53, 62 Calculations suggest that 45 mL/kg of plasma would need to be given to increase albumin serum concentration by 1 g/dL.84 In cases of coagulation factor deficiencies, plasma should be given to effect (i.e., until active bleeding ceases).50 For the treatment of coagulation disorders, 6 to 10 mL/kg is the recommended starting dosage. Multiple doses may be required to control bleeding because of the short half-life of clotting factors, especially in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Normalization of previously abnormal coagulation tests can be used as a guide for discontinuation of plasma therapy.",

It is useful in the treatment of deficiencies of these clotting factors and is handled in the same manner as fresh frozen plasma. Two studies have shown cryoprecipitate to be the blood product of choice for the treatment of von Willebrand's disease because it concentrates the larger, more hemostatically active von Willebrand's multimers into a smaller volume than fresh frozen plasma.12, 78 Cryoprecipitate is equivalent to fresh frozen plasma for the treatment of hemophilia A.

Of the five blood groups for which typing sera are available, a transfusion reaction has been attributed to antibody against DEA 1.1 induced by a DEA 1.1-positive transfusion in a DEA 1.1-negative recipient and to an antibody induced by a DEA 4-positive transfusion in a DEA 4-negative dog.26, 58 In theory, red blood cells expressing DEA 1.2 can sensitize a DEA 1.2-negative transfusion recipient, resulting in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction if a second transfusion of DEA 1.2-positive blood is given. In a laboratory setting, antibodies against DEA 1.2 have been reported to cause transfusion reactions, but clinical reports of hemolytic transfusion reactions mediated by anti-DEA 1.2 antibodies are lacking. Approximately 45% of dog red blood cells are positive for DEA 7. It is believed DEA 7 is structurally related to an antigen found in common bacteria. A naturally occurring antibody against DEA 7 has been described in 20% to 50% of DEA 7-negative dogs and may result in accelerated removal of DEA 7-positive cells from a DEA-negative donor with anti-DEA 7 antibodies.73 Based on this information, the recommendation has been made to select donors that are negative for DEA 1.1, 1.2, and 7. Others suggest the donor dog should also have red blood cells positive for DEA 4 to be designated as a universal donor.33 Ninety-eight percent of dogs are DEA 4-positive, making it easy to find donors of this blood type.

Because the ideal feline blood donor lives in an indoor environment and is not exposed to other cats, the author believes vaccinations against FeLV, FIV, and FIP are unnecessary in donor cats. Heartworm testing should be performed and prophylaxis should be administered to donor dogs and cats on the schedule recommended for pets in the geographic region of the blood bank.

Warming blood has the potential for excessive heating, causing red blood cell membrane damage and hemolysis or bacterial growth if contamination is present. Blood warming devices that use dry heat, radio waves, microwaves, or electromagnetic energy are available, but cost often is prohibitive. Refrigerated human blood can be warmed quickly by admixing it with warm (45 to 60\u00b0 C) 0.9% saline in a ratio of 1:1 without damage to red blood cells.42 This method has not been tested for dogs or cats. Once blood is warmed to 37\u00b0 C, it deteriorates rapidly and, if not used, should be discarded. Fresh frozen plasma must be thawed before transfusion. A method for thawing canine fresh frozen plasma in a microwave oven has been described, but the author has found this unsatisfactory because of uneven heating by household microwave ovens.41 Plasma can be thawed at room temperature, and if the thawing time needs to be shortened, the plasma can be placed into a plastic bag and thawed in a 37\u00b0 C water bath. The plastic bag is necessary to prevent contamination of the infusion ports in the water bath. Plasma should be used within 4 hours of thawing.",

The increase in potassium in the storage medium is a contributing factor in the development of hyperkalemia in patients receiving large volume transfusions of stored blood. A large-volume transfusion of stored blood can cause hyperkalemia, but this is rare unless the patient has renal failure or preexisting hyperkalemia.43 Hyperkalemia in a transfusion recipient is as it would be in any patient with hyperkalemia. The transfusion should be discontinued and 0.9% NaCl administered because 0.9% NaCl does not contain added potassium and will facilitate renal excretion of potassium. Intravenous administration of insulin, followed by administration of 50% dextrose and frequent monitoring of blood glucose and potassium concentrations until serum potassium concentration normalizes, is all that is necessary. Routine empirical administration of calcium to transfusion recipients cannot be recommended because of the risk of hypercalcemia and increased myocardial irritability, but animals with ionized hypocalcemia resulting from large transfusion should be treated with calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to effect.14 Physical damage (such as freezing or overheating) to red blood cells during storage causes hemolysis. While being transfused, the patient exhibits hemoglobinuria and hemoglobinemia without evidence of other signs of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, such as fever, vomiting, or collapse.

In all animals suspected of having some form of acute transfusion reaction, the transfusion should be stopped and samples of patient blood and urine obtained for baseline evaluation of biochemical, hematologic, and coagulation values. The unit of blood should be inspected to ensure it is from the appropriate species and is the intended unit based on the crossmatch or blood type. Urine can be visually inspected to determine the presence or absence of hemoglobin. A Gram stain and bacterial culture of the blood remaining in the blood bag should be done. Rectal temperature of the recipient should be compared with the pretransfusion value. A transfusion-associated fever is defined as an increase in 1\u00b0 F over the pretransfusion temperature.83 The cardiovascular system should be monitored by electrocardiogram and blood pressure measurement. Immediate evaluation of serum ionized calcium and potassium concentrations would be useful, but certain electrocardiographic changes suggest hypocalcemia (long QT interval with a normal heart rate) or hyperkalemia (decreased height of P waves, loss of P waves, or widening of the QRS complex with large T waves) if rapid measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations cannot be obtained. Venous access and blood pressure should be maintained by an infusion of a crystalloid solution such as lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9% NaCl. Intravenous administration of short-acting glucocorticoids may suppress some of the mediators of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions and lessen the clinical progression, but their efficacy in transfusion reactions has not been evaluated in veterinary patients. When the evaluation of a patient with a suspected transfusion reaction suggests that an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is occurring, the blood typing and crossmatching must be repeated to determine whether a laboratory error is responsible for the reaction. When fever occurs without evidence of hemolysis and the Gram stain is negative for bacterial contamination, the transfusion may be restarted.",

The Food and Drug Administration has approved a hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying (HBOC) fluid, Oxyglobin (Biopure Corporation, Cambridge, MA), for use in the dog. Oxyglobin (hemoglobin glutamer-200 [bovine]) is ultrapurified, polymerized hemoglobin of bovine origin (13 g/dL) in a modified Ringer's lactate solution with a physiologic pH (7.8). The hemoglobin polymers range in molecular mass from 65 to 500 kD, with an average of 200 kD. The viscosity is low compared with blood (1.3 and 3.5 centipoise, respectively), and the solution is isosmotic (300 mOsm/kg) with blood. The concentration of methemoglobin, the inactive form of hemoglobin, is 10%. Oxyglobin can be stored at room temperature or refrigerated (2 to 30\u00b0 C) for up to 3 years. Its intravascular half-life is dose dependent (18 to 43 hours, at a dosage of 10 to 30 mL/kg), as measured in healthy dogs. It is expected that more than 90% of the administered dose will be eliminated from the body in 5 to 7 days after infusion. The oxygen half-saturation pressure (P-50) of Oxyglobin is greater than that of canine blood (38 versus 30 mm Hg, respectively). This increase in P-50 facilitates offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin. The hemoglobin is packaged in the deoxygenated state in an overwrap that is impermeable to oxygen.",
