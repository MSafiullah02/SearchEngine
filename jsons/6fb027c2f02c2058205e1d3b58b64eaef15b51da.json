Such models could even elucidate the dependency of the inhibition potency on the pH-value of the environment and the influence of the His moiety of the cysteine protease.

The potential energy surface scans were performed with a resolution of 0.1 \u00c5 for the respective grid points. Transition states were identified as maximum points on the potential curves. Frequency analysis of transition states confirmed their nature. The r(O--H) distance (see Figure 2 of the publication) which represents the main coordinate of the protonation of the emerging intermediate had not to be treated as an independent variable. During the optimization of the remaining internal degrees of freedom this coordinate smoothly adjusted for varying distances r(S--C) and r(S--H). The corresponding potential energy surface is depicted in Figure 4 of the publication (upper part). To investigate the influence of r(O--H) in more detail we also computed a two-dimensional PES for which r(O--H) is varied together with the r(S--C).
