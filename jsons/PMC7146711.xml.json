Public health EP&R funding and resources increased after the terrorism attack on September 11, 2001 and the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and there has been some strengthening of infrastructure for EP&R at the national, state and local levels. For instance, MRCs have expanded and increased recruitment and training for all volunteers, including pharmacists. Pharmacy professionals have joined and serve as members of local and state MRCs. As MRC members, pharmacists work in interdisciplinary teams in a variety of roles including, point-of-dispensing (POD) activities such as receiving medications and supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), managing inventory, ensuring adequate drugs and supplies, dispensing medications, and providing education for diverse patient populations.",

These drugs will be distributed from the SNS to states for providers to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions.24 To prevent misuse and hoarding, twenty two (22) states issued guidelines for pharmacists who are being allowed to \u201cuse their professional judgment when filling prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine\u201d to ensure adequate supplies for patients with ongoing need for these medications for legitimate and/or pre-existing conditions such as lupus.25 Guidance for remaining states are pending and pharmacy organizations and Boards of Pharmacy in these states should work to ensure that there are adequate measures taken to ensure medications for patients who currently need them. On March 31, 2020, the FDA announced a new program known as the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP) to use every tool at the agency's disposal to bring new therapies to sick patients as quickly as possible, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether these medical countermeasures are safe and effective for treating patients infected with this novel virus.24\n",

            "text": "Other factors that contribute to these challenges include workplace categorizations that impact pharmacies. According to the OSHA SIC Division Structure28 (https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html), pharmacies are not categorized in \u201cMajor Group 80\u201d, which includes medical offices and clinics, hospitals and nursing homes. Instead pharmacies are included in \u201cMajor Group 59: Miscellaneous Retail\u201d, a category that includes liquor stores, second hand stores, bicycle shops, and gas stations and convenience stores.28 In other words, pharmacies are not included within the category of professions at the highest risk for exposure to coronavirus. Based on these categories, some employers may be interpreting this to mean that, given pharmacies are retail workplaces, there are less strict requirements for providing masks and gloves for pharmacists and coworkers. However, pharmacists and managers can use their professional judgement, as they know their own professional commitments, as well as that of their co-workers, may put them at high risk of exposure that will require PPE (e.g., vaccinations, medication management services, patient counseling, etc.). When masks are warranted, pharmacists and managers can help their co-workers properly fit the devices, including those with beards, to assure optimal protection at the CDC-NIOSH website.29\n",

The HIV and Ebola virus outbreaks date from the 1980's and 1990's, but the recent focus on viral pneumonias date to the Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus (HPAI) (H5N1 Asian HPAI) outbreak in 1997, with cases reported in Hong Kong, China and elsewhere.41 The H5N1 Asian HPAI re-focus news media attention on previous deadly pandemics, including the oft-forgotten 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic.42 Similarly, DeGuire et al.40 noted how the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 on the World Trade Centers and Pentagon resulted in increased federal funding for EP&R through the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA). The associated October 2001 postal anthrax attacks targeting Congress also highlighted the importance of EP&R countermeasures. Anthrax response plans included the integration of pharmacies.43 Pharmacists and pharmacy educators were included in CDC-led training programs in Atlanta for anthrax prophylaxis for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Participants were encouraged to return home and further disseminate training information at the state and county level, which in turn involved pharmacy students and practitioners in POD exercises. The 2002/2003 global outbreak of SARS alerted the medical and scientific community of the virulence and potential impact of SARSs.44 The resurgence of H1N1 in the 2009 pandemic illustrated the value of the SNS to stockpile and distribute antiviral agents, including EUAs for special uses,45 as well as implementing restrictions to limit hoarding of antivirals. This further served to highlight the importance of pharmacists in ER&P response during pandemics as effective team members and gatekeepers, as well as increased integration of pharmacies and pharmacists into EP&R17\n,\n45 However, as noted by Gudi and Tiwari (2020)46, despite the contagiousness of H1N1 and the virulence of the 2003 SARS and more recent Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, these outbreaks did not spur maintenance of vibrant EP&R structures or rapidly deployable resources for public responses in preparation for the current pandemic. Thus, despite the widespread impacts of 1918 influenza, the most recent influenza pandemic in 2009, and ongoing MERS coronavirus outbreaks, hard lessons were unlearned, and there is an impaired response capability to public health emergencies such as the current pandemic.47\n",

CAPE educational outcomes were published in 1992, 1998, 2004 and 2013. CAPE 2004, published shortly after September 11, 2001, granted prominence to public health, where it was one of the three major domains.49 This provided a clear incentive for PharmD programs to build on or add curricular and co-curricular elements of public health, including EP&R. In contrast, as noted by Covey et al. (2017)50, in the CAPE 2013 outcomes, the term public health was replaced with the narrower term population health. Furthermore, public health related topics were given reduced prominence in CAPE 2013, with no mention of EP&R nor related topics such as disaster or emergency preparedness, pandemic planning, or civil defense.51\n",
