The spread of disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms of a SIS (Susceptible Infected Susceptible) process over the epidemic layer and the spread of information about the disease outbreak is described in terms of an UAU (Unaware Aware Unaware) process over the virtual interaction mediated awareness layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and the resulting co-evolution of these mutually competing processes is studied in terms of a network topology dependent parameter (\u03b1). Using a second order linear theory it is shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these processes can be described in terms of damped and driven harmonic oscillator equations. From the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that for a suitable choice of the parameter(\u03b1), the two processes can either exhibit sustained oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to the endemic state. Further, for the case of an endemic state it is shown that inclusion of the awareness layer significantly lowers the disease transmission rate and reduces the size of the epidemic. The endemic state infection probability of a given node corresponding to the damped dynamics is found to have a dependence upon both the transmission rates as well as on the absolute intra-layer and relative inter-layer degrees of the individual nodes. [2] , spread of H1N1 virus and bird flu, etc.. In these scenarios, the dissemination of the epidemic outbreak information results in disease awareness among the individuals, thereby prompting them to take preventive measures. The resultant preventive measures undertaken by the individuals may include wearing masks, improving personal hygiene or social distancing. These actions in turn can lower their susceptibility to the disease. The interdependence of epidemics over its corresponding awareness results in a mutually interacting and competitive progression of these dynamical processes. This interplay between the spread of epidemics due to persistent physical contacts and its corresponding awareness through virtual contacts has immensely contributed to the ever growing interest in this area of research [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The understanding of such interacting processes can help in the comprehensive planning and implementation of immunization programmes [12, 13] .",

            "text": "From the results of these earlier studies it is known that, there is no outbreak of the disease when the rate of transmission is less than a critical value (i.e. \u03b2 I < \u03b2 c ). The infection probability of each node in this case is reduced to zero. The disease spreads when the rate of transmission is greater than or equal to the critical value (i.e. \u03b2 I \u2265 \u03b2 c ). For the latter cases, the fraction of individuals in the infected state is non-zero. Beyond the critical value \u03b2 c , the fraction of infected individuals increases gradually with a further increase in the value of transmission rate (\u03b2 I ). However, in real life one can find many instances where the rates of transmission may not be stationary but can vary in time [29] . The time variation of transmission rates may arise due to the inherent recurring nature of the epidemics with leading and recovering phases [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The leading or growing phase of the disease in such cases is associated with the increase in the rate of transmission \u03b2, whereas it decreases in the recovery phase. Alternatively, the temporal variation in the rates of transmission may also arise when the time rate of spread of disease information is comparable to rate of spread of disease. In this case, in the absence of initial disease related information there is no correlation between the disease and its associated awareness to start with. Consequently the disease spreads at the maximum rate. At later times, the spread of epidemic causes an increase in the rates of transmission of awareness which results in the development of a correlation between the two processes. The spread of awareness resulting from the collective behavior of the nodes beyond the threshold value of the awareness transmission rate lowers the rate of transmission of the disease. Such a scenario is in accordance with everyday observations whereby the epidemic initially spreads in a network (e.g. social or computer networks) in the absence of initial awareness. However, the spread of infection results in the development/availability of preventive measures (vaccines or anti-virus software) which reduces the infection level. The time variation of the transmission rates due to the coevolution of these processes can modify the rate of spread of disease and its corresponding awareness. This may also simultaneously affect the threshold levels of these processes and the fraction of infected individuals. In general, the time variation of the respective rates of transmission for such co-evolving processes can have very complicated functional forms with an implicit or explicit dependence upon multiple factors. The intensity and mechanism of temporal modulation of transmission rates may depend upon the topology of network which is manifested in terms of intra-layer as well as inter-layer linking pattern of nodes. Another important factor to be considered while taking the time variation of the rates is an assessment of the inter-dependency of the respective rates of transmission upon each other. Thus, it is evident that the introduction of time variation in the rates of transmission can provide new perspectives in the study of co-evolution of such interdependent processes. Consequently, it is a challenging problem to design a comprehensive mathematical framework for examining the cumulative effects of time variation of respective rates of transmission on the infection and awareness probabilities of the participating nodes.",

In this framework, the differential rate of transmission for each of the nodes on the epidemic layer corresponding to the spread of disease depends upon the awareness probability of the node on the awareness layer. Similarly, the differential rate of transmission for the spread of disease related awareness correspond-ing to each of the nodes on the awareness layer depend upon its infection probability on the awareness layer. The collective dynamics of the nodes over the different layers of multiplex network results in the co-propagation of the epidemics and its corresponding awareness which in turn causes the temporal modulation of the transmission rates. The extent of temporal modulation of the differential rates of transmission depends upon both intra as well as inter layer linking patterns of the nodes. Thus, the new framework is self-consistently able to encompass the role of network topology in the temporal modulation of respective rates of transmission as well as upon the infection and awareness probabilities of the nodes.",

A discrete time Monte Carlo Markov chain method is used to describe the spread of disease and its corresponding awareness.

This corresponds to the realistic case, where an important individual with high degree of links in one of the layers (e.g., representing persistent physical interactions) tends to have similar linking pattern on another network layer that reflect other kind of relations among the same individuals (e.g., representing virtual interactions). It is also worthwhile to mention here, that the earlier studies have highlighted the dependence of rate of spread of dynamical variable viz. disease, information etc. over complex network with fixed number of nodes upon the number of links [35, 36] .

In the absence of awareness (i.e U ), the disease spreads on the infection layer (L 1 ) with maximum rate of transmission (\u03b2 I (0) = 1).

The spread of the awareness is a result of the collective behavior of the nodes on the virtual layer (L 2 ) whereby the leading eigenvalue of the transition matrix corresponding to these transmission rates becomes greater than or equal to one. Thus it is evident that the spread of disease information on the awareness layer is a result of cumulative effect of self-awareness due to infection on the disease layer (L 1 ) and the interaction among neighboring nodes on the awareness layer (L 2 ). The gradual increase in the awareness probability (P A i ) in turn inhibits the rate of progression of the disease by lowering the disease transmission rates (\u03b2 I i ) on the infection layer (L 1 ). The reduction in the disease transmission rate enhances the recovery process which thereupon lowers the infection probability of the individuals on the infection layer (L 1 ). The decrease in the infection probability is often accompanied by the decline in the preventive measures, which in turn retards the rate of spread of corresponding awareness on the information layer (L 2 ). On recovering from the infection, the individuals become susceptible to the disease and tend to lose awareness. This loss of awareness can again increase the rate of transmission of the disease on the infection layer and thus prompt a repeat of the whole process. Such a coupling between two mutually competing processes on the multiplex layers is analogous to the inductive coupling in the electric circuits in which the buildup or decline of current is self-consistently opposed by the resulting electromotive force (E.M.F) and vice versa.",

It is known from previous studies [25, 28, 36] , that for both homogeneous and heterogeneous rates of transmission the disease free state is asymptotically stable if the largest eigenvalue of M given by \u03b6 M satisfies the condition \u03b6 M < 1. Thus for \u03b6 M < 1, the infection or awareness will die out exponentially fast with the rate determined by \u03b6 M . The present study is intended to investigate the effect of time variation of the transmission rates resulting from their mutual coupling. For this a numerical investigation has been carried out for the following three cases: In the first case, the value of structure functions is chosen such that the minimum critical rates (i.e.\u03b2 I i min and \u03b2 A i min ) in each layer results in the eigenvalues of matrix M 1 and M 2 being less than one i.e.\u03b6 M 1 < 1 and \u03b6 M 2 < 1 for which their is no outbreak of dynamical process (i.e. infection or awareness). In the second case, the value of structure functions is chosen such that the minimum critical rates (i.e.\u03b2 I i min and \u03b2 A i min ) in each layer results in the eigenvalues of matrix M 1 and M 2 being nearly equal to one i.e.\u03b6 M I \u2248 1 and \u03b6 M 1 \u2248 1 for which there is an outbreak of the dynamical process.",

They provide a detailed insight into the co-evolving dynamics of the disease along with its corresponding information over the infection (L 1 ) and awareness (L 2 ) layers by taking into account the selfconsistent temporal modulations of the respective transmission rates. It is well known, that in the absence of such temporal variations, the outbreak and progression of these dynamical processes depend on the critical value of the respective transmission rates [25, 28, 36] . The focus of the present work is twofold: firstly, to understand the mechanism of temporal modulation of these rates and to subsequently examine their effect on the critical properties of the aforementioned processes. The spread of disease in this framework is assumed to be caused by the persistent physical contacts and its dynamics is described over the infection The results of the parametric study are segregated in terms of three different cases (i.e. 1,2 and 3) which correspond to the aforementioned respective parametric domains. In the present work, the nodes supporting the co-progression of these dynamical processes in the multiplex layers for all the three cases are initially in the disease free (or susceptible S) and unaware state (U). The corresponding initial marginal probabilities for each of the layers and the respective transmission rates can be mathematically expressed as, P I i \u2248 0 and \u03b2 I i \u2248 1 and P A i \u2248 0 and \u03b2 A i \u2248 \u03b2 A i min . In all three cases, the absence of initial awareness results in the spread of disease on the infection layer (L 1 ) at a maximum rate of transmission (\u03b2 I i (0) \u2248 1). Fig. 3 describes the time evolution of infection (P I i ) and awareness probabilities (P A i ) for each of the multiplex nodes in the absence of any temporal modulation of the respective transmission rates.

It is evident from the results described in case-1, that there is no outbreak and subsequent spread of awareness (i.e. P A i = 0) on the layer L 2 , when the awareness transmission rates modified by the initial infection probability are less than the corresponding critical value For case-1, this results in a repetitive cycle similar to the initial one, but due to an asymmetric spread of disease, the level of awareness is relatively enhanced in comparison to its initial value. The finite awareness lowers the disease transmission rate which reduces the peak infection probability of the nodes in the subsequent cycles. It can also be seen, that unlike the initial time instant, the rates of disease transmission for different nodes of the network are neither equal to unity nor do they have uniform values. The non-uniform modulation intensity of initially uniform transmission rates result in the variable levels of infection and its corresponding awareness. Furthermore, for this case, the system exhibits no endemic (or equilibrium) state and there are self-sustained alternating cycles of infection followed by awareness. Moreover, in comparison to the time independent case, there is an outbreak as well as a spread of disease even when the lower bound transmission rates are less than the critical value.",

Thus from these results it can be concluded, that the presence of disease awareness can substantially lower both the rate of disease transmission and the marginal infection probability of the nodes. In addition, it is also found that the lower rate Detailed results of the simulations as shown in Fig. 4 , provide insights into the mechanism of spread of disease and its corresponding awareness over the different layers of the multiplex network. The role of network topology on the co-evolution of these processes can be further understood by examining the dependence of the respective probabilities and their associated transmission rates on the intra-layer and inter-layer linking patterns. Fig. 6 , describes the intra-layer degree based temporal evolution of infection and awareness probabilities (i.e. P I,A K [1,2] (t) ), along with their associated transmission rates ( \u03b2 I,A K [1,2] (t) ), on the corresponding multiplex layers. From the figure, it can be seen, that the probabilities and the respective transmission rates for both the processes (i.e. disease and awareness) have dependence upon the intra-layer node degree. The comparison between the degree based progression characteristics of the two processes on the infection (L 1 ) and awareness layers (L 2 ) highlights, the difference in the parametric dependence of marginal probabilities upon the respective transmission rates. For the infection layer (L 1 ), the increase in the intra-layer node degree (K 1 : min \u2192 max) increases the infection probability (P I K 1 : 0 \u2192 1), but it lowers the rate of transmission (\u03b2 I K 1 : 1 \u2192 0) in each of the aforementioned domains. By contrast, the increase in the intra-layer node degree (K 2 : min \u2192 max) on the awareness layer (L 2 ), results in the simultaneous increase in the awareness probability (P A K 2 : 0 \u2192 1) and the respective rates of transmission (\u03b2 A K 2 : 0 \u2192 1) for each of the three domains. From these results, it can be inferred that, the awareness resulting from disease information and intra-layer node degree have contrasting roles in the spread of disease. The spread of awareness (i.e.P A K 2 : 0 \u2192 1) tend to reduce the infection probability (i.e.P I K 1 : 1 \u2192 0) by lowering the respective disease transmission rates (\u03b2 I K 1 : 1 \u2192 0), but an increase in the intra-layer node degree (i.e. K 2 : min \u2192 max ) tends to enhance the infection probability (i.e.P I K 1 ; 0 \u2192 1). Thus the effective infection probability of node is a result of these two mutually competing factors. For lower degree nodes, the awareness predominates over the effect of intra-layer node degree, and as a result, the infection probability of these nodes is lower even with a high transmission rate. In contrast, for nodes with a high intra-layer degree, the awareness cannot reduce the infection probability but can only lower the corresponding transmission rates. The cumulative effect of multiple simultaneous interactions due to high degree results in high infection probability (i.e.P I K 1 \u2248 1). However, the high infection probability also implies greater self-awareness, which in turn increases the rate of transmission of disease information (\u03b2 A K 2 : 0 \u2192 1) and facilitates its spread on the awareness layer (i.e.P A K 2 \u2248 1). Thus it is evident, that the intra-layer linking pattern of nodes has a significant effect on the temporal evolution of these processes over the respective layers of the multiplex.",

Further, the extent of this decrease has an inverse dependence on the modulus of relative difference in the node degrees (i.e. | \u03b4 |). From the figure it can also be seen that the infection probability of the nodes is higher for the sub-category of nodes belonging to \u03b4 \u2265 0 than for \u03b4 \u2264 0 sub-category. Moreover for (\u03b4 \u2265 0), the infection probabilities of the corresponding nodes increases with an increase in the relative difference in the degree of the nodes. However for (\u03b4 \u2264 0) corresponding to cases (2) and (3), an increase in the magnitude of relative difference of the node degree (i.e. \u2212\u03b4), initially decreases the infection probability but any further increase results in variable levels of infection probabilities. Thus, the effect on infection probability is not symmetric about the relative difference in the inter-layer degree of nodes.",

The larger self-awareness increases the corresponding rate of transmission (i.e. \u03b2 A \u03b4 \u2248 1) and results in high awareness probabilities (i.e. P A K 2 \u2248 1). The high awareness probability in turn lowers the respective rates of disease transmission (\u03b2 I \u03b4 ). However for \u03b4 \u2264 0 (i.e.K 1 < K 2 ), the relatively higher degree of the nodes in the awareness layer in comparison to the infection layer facilitates the spread of awareness. The resultant larger awareness probability in turn simultaneously reduces the disease transmission rates (\u03b2 I K 1 ) and the infection probability. Therefore, for these nodes the magnitude of awareness transmission rates (\u03b2 A K 2 ) is relatively greater than the disease transmission rates (\u03b2 I K 1 ). Thus from this analysis, it can be concluded that the relative difference in the inter-layer degree (\u03b4) also has a significant effect on the infection and awareness probabilities as well on the modulation intensity of respective rates.",

Fig-8 , describes the dependence of the infection and awareness probabilities on the absolute degree of nodes (i.e. P I (K 1 , K 2 ) and P A (K 1 , K 2 )). From Fig-8 , it can be inferred that for the cases (2) and (3) in the parametric regime corresponding to \u03b4 \u2264 0 in Fig-3 , the variation in the infection probability depends not just on the relative difference in the degree of nodes but has additional dependence on the absolute degree of nodes. This inference implies that the absolute number of physical contacts in the disease layer has a dominant effect on the infection probability of the nodes where the high degree of awareness can only slow down the spread of disease but cannot subdue it. Thus, from these results it can be concluded that the new framework provides a deeper insight into the role of network structure modulated self-consistent temporal variation of transmission rates on the concurrent spread of disease coupled awareness over a multiplex networks.",

The spread of disease due to the persistent physical contacts over the infection layer is considered to be concurrent with the spread of its corresponding disease information induced awareness by the virtual contacts over the awareness layer. The dynamics of these mutually competing processes results in the self-consistent temporal variation of the respective rates of transmission for each of these processes. The modulation intensity of the respective transmission rates has an implicit dependence over the intra-layer and inter-layer linking pattern of nodes. Such a temporal variation in the transmission rates can affect the critical properties for the spread of disease and its awareness. From the extensive numerical and theoretical work it has been shown that the progression characteristics of these processes depend upon the choice of minimum rates of transmission for each layer. For the case, when the minimum value of the transmission rates for each of the layer is chosen to be less than its critical value, the system doesn't exhibit an equilibrium state. But it is rather characterized by alternating repetitive cycles of high level of infection followed by high awareness.",

In the equilibrium state, there is a simultaneous prevalence of disease and its awareness. From the results, it has been further found that the absolute infection probability of the nodes is predominantly dependent upon the degree of the nodes in the disease layer. The findings of the present work can account for the real life scenario wherein an individual can have high infection probability even with high level of disease awareness and low rate of disease transmission owing to its larger connectivity. Moreover, it is also shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-progression of these interacting processes can be described in terms of coupled damped and driven oscillator equations. The self-consistent driving force is shown to depend upon the internal structure of the multiplex networks. ",

Such alternate modes of interactions act in conjugation with those arising from persistent real physical contacts. The intricate coupling of these aforementioned interactions can affect the outbreak threshold and even alter the progression of the resultant dynamical processes such as the spread of epidemics and its corresponding awareness. In earlier works, the dynamics of such mutually coupled processes have been studied assuming the respective rates of transmission to be time invariant and mutually exclusive of each other. However, in real life the interaction among such interdependent processes can cause temporal modulation of the respective rates of transmissions depending upon the state of participating individuals. In this work, a non-liner stochastic model is presented to study the dynamics of such interdependent processes over a multiplex network. The model highlights the role of network topology in the self-consistent temporal modulation of respective rates of transmission. The theoretical and Monte Carlo simulation results delineate the interplay of different factors in the outbreak and subsequent spread of such mutually dependent processes. The spread of epidemics along with information dissemination are two intriguing and traditionally independent topics of research in the study of complex networks. However, the last few years have witnessed an ever increasing diversification in the communication services due to rapid advances in the field of wireless technology which has interlinked different mobile devices with social networks. Such couplings have resulted in alternate modes of communication which in turn have facilitated the virtual contacts mediated dissemination of information[1]. These modes of information dissemination are complementary to the traditional ones like word of mouth which result from physical contacts. The spread of disease information induced awareness over such modes can have profound effects on the threshold of the epidemic outbreak as well as upon its subsequent size. The prominent real life examples highlighting the role of awareness in the spread of epidemics includes the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the year 2003 in China",

Similarly, an individual on the awareness layer (L 2 ) can also be in either of two states, namely, unaware (denoted by U, those which are ignorant of the presence of disease) or aware (denoted by A, those which have the knowledge of the disease). The model follows a paradigmatic approach in which the microscopic details for the cause of infection as well as its resultant awareness are ignored and the states are assessed only macroscopically. The individuals are neither assumed to have permanent immunity to the disease nor do they have persistent memory about it, which results in the loss of awareness.

The maximum in the value of awareness and infection probabilities results in minimum value for the infection transmission rate (i.e. \u03b2 I i min = \u03b2 I i 0 (1 \u2212 \u03b1 I i )) and maximum for the corresponding information transmission rates (i.e. \u03b2 A imax = \u03b2 A i 0 ) respectively.

The disease dynamics is based on the discrete time nonlinear SIS model in which a given node at any time can be in either of the two states namely, susceptible (S) or infected (I). Similarly, the virtual contacts mediated spread of disease information is described over the awareness layer (L 2 ) in terms of UAU model for which each of the nodes can be in two states namely, unaware (U) or aware (A). The Barab\u00e0si-Albert (BA)[37, 38] model has been used to generate each layer of the scale free multiplex network with a power law degree distribution of the links. Each multiplex layer has the same number of nodes (N=5 \u00d7 10 2 ) with a minimum of two links per node. Our study has been carried out in the parameter space of the variables \u03b1 i[L 1 ,L 2 ] , which regulate the lower bound of the temporally modulated rates of transmission on the infection (L 1 ) and awareness (L 2 ) layers. These lower bounds correspond to their respective time invariant critical values for the outbreak and successive progression of each of these processes. The simulations describing the co-propagation of these processes have been divided in the following three parametric domains: In the first case, these variables (i.e.\u03b1 i[L 1 ,L 2 ] ) are chosen such that lower bound of the modulated rates of transmission for each of these processes can be less than the respective time invariant critical values i.e. 0 < \u03b2 I min < \u03b2 I c and 0 < \u03b2 A min < \u03b2 A c . In the second case, these variables (i.e.\u03b1 i[L 1 ,L 2 ]) are chosen such that the lower bound of the modulated rates of transmission for each of these processes is nearly equal to their respective critical values i.e. \u03b2 I min \u2248 \u03b2 I c and \u03b2 A min \u2248 \u03b2 A c . In the final case, the variables (i.e. \u03b1 i[L 1 ,L 2 ] ) are chosen such that the lower bound of the modulated rates of the transmission is greater than their critical value i.e. \u03b2 I min > \u03b2 I c and \u03b2 A min > \u03b2 A c . At the onset of the simulation, a certain fraction of the nodes (5%) are randomly infected. In the present work the transmission rates for the spread of infection and awareness are normalized to the respective rate of recovery (\u00b5 I ) and loss of awareness (\u00b5 A ). The rates of recovery for each of the processes are assumed to be unity (i.e.\u00b5 I = 1 and \u00b5 A = 1). The coupled set of equations given by Eqs.4 and 8 describes the dynamical state of a network at any given time.",

Furthermore, the initial awareness (i.e. P A i (0)) modulated infection transmission rates are found to have no significant effect on the infection dynamics over the disease layer (L 1 ) and the infection probability saturates to maximum value (i.e. P I i = 1). For the case-2, the values of parameters \u03b1 A i have been chosen such that the minimum transmission rates on the awareness layer (L 2 ) are comparable to the corresponding is evident from the results that in this case there is an outbreak of the process resulting in a finite value of the awareness marginal probabilities (i.e. P A i = 0). For the case-3, the increase in the transmission rates beyond critical values ( i.e \u03b2 the respective awareness probability. From the figure, it can be further inferred that, for both cases, 2 and 3, the increase in awareness level (P A i = 0) in the absence of any temporal modulations, neither alters the rate of spread of infection nor reduces the infection probability which saturates to maximum value (P I i = 1).Fig. 4elucidates the effect of self-consistent temporal modulation of the respective rates of transmission for each of the three aforementioned cases. In comparison to the unmodulated case, in the presence of temporal modulation the infected individuals (i.e. P I i = 0) gain information about the disease which results in the increase of the transmission rates (\u03b2 A i ) for these nodes on the awareness layer (L 2 ). The increase in the information transmission rate in turn has a dual impact on the collective dynamics of the nodes in each of the layers: firstly, it triggers the spread of disease information on the awareness layer (L 2 ); secondly, the spread of the information induced awareness tends to simultaneously retard the spread of disease on the other layer (L 1 ) by lowering the corresponding transmission rates. The resultant reduction in the disease transmission rate aids in the process of recovery and thus lowers the infection probability (P I i ). The recovered nodes (or individuals) tend to lose the disease awareness and become susceptible to it. From the figure, it is evident that there is a marked difference between the progression characteristics of these processes corresponding to the case-(1) and that of the cases-(2) and(3).",

This figure describes the phase relationship between the respective infection and awareness probabilities with their respective rates of transmissions as functions of the parameter \u03b1 which in turn determines the lower bound of the transmission rates. It is evident from the figure that for case-(1) which corresponds to the condition when the minimum individual rates of transmission are less than the threshold value the system exhibits sustained oscillations. Cases (2) and (3) correspond to the parametric regime in which the minimum rates of transmission are equal to or greater than the threshold value. In these regimes the system exhibits damped oscillations and for each of these cases the average probabilities along with their respective transmission rates attain a fixed value.",
