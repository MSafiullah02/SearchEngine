At the meantime more than 1000 medical staff were infected in China, resulting in 5 deaths. The First People's Hospital is appointed COVID-19 patients treatment institution in Zhaoqing City. By far it has accepted 20 confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia patients, out of which 10 cases have been cured and 1 case ended in casualty. According to the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (6th Trail Edition), this virus is highly contagious and can spread quickly among population. There is no specific diagnosis and treatment program against the pneumonia caused by COVID-19 (Zhu et al., 2020).",

According to documents such as the in-use guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, this virus can be inactivated either at 75% alcohol, 56 degrees incubation for 30 min, or 65 degrees incubation for 10 min according to Chinese expert\u2019s consensus (National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2020; Group of experts on medical treatment from Tongji Hospital affiliated of Wuhan Tongji Medical College, 2020; Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, 2020). In order to reduce the risk of in-lab infection during the experimental operation, reduce the mental stress of laboratory staff, the high-risk specimen will be inactivated before the lab-test undergoes. However it remains unknown whether the specimen inactivation would affect the subsequent RT-PCR test results or not. Therefore, this study intends to compare 4 different inactivation methods to explore impact of the 4 inactivation methods upon the results of viral nucleic acid PCR detection, and to lower the risk of medical staff in-lab infection while ensuring the accuracy of the test, and eventually to provide new solutions for the laboratory biosecurity environment protection.",

As the data analysis results show, for the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P\uff1c0.001). Besides, as the figure shown, for the N gene, 12.5% (1/8) of scattered points of 56\u2103/30 min inactivated sample, 65\u2103/10 min sample, RNA virus-specific preservation fluid sample were distributed outside the 95% trust interval. For the ORF1ab gene, All points are distributed within the 95% trust interval.This indicates that the results of the four treatment methods and non-inactivation treatment have shown good consistency.",

Most laboratories tend to use three other inactivation methods as the RNA virus-specific preservation fluid tubes need to be purchased separately. There are also some limitations in this research because only two specimens were analyzed. Furthermore, dilution of the sample may lead to the decreases in detection efficiency. In this case for some specimens with low CT value, the sample size needs to be expanded for further analysis. Besides in this particular study, used only one test kit box is used for analysis, and it is suggested that future researchers should expanded the scope of study, in order to provide up-to-date strategies for virus inactivation.",
