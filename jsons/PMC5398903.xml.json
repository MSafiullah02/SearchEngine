Pneumonia was suspected clinically if the following two or more criteria were fulfilled: new airspace opacity on a chest radiograph; body temperature >38.3\u00b0C or <36.0\u00b0C, white blood count >12,000/mm3 or <4,000/mm3, or >10% bandemia; and a positive microbial culture. The site for BAL sampling was selected on the basis of the most recent chest X-ray or high-resolution computer tomography of the chest (if available). BAL was performed using a fibrobronchoscope by introducing 200 mL of a sterile, warm saline solution into a bronchial subsegment and aspirating it back in four 50-mL aliquots. The BAL samples were analyzed in the hospital's microbiology and pathology laboratories for the presence of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in accordance with normal practice. The bacteria analyzed included aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, legionella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycobacteria. Urinary antigen testing was performed for the detection of S pneumoniae and L pneumophila (BinaxNOW, Alere, Scarborough, USA). The fungal analysis involved candida culture, an aspergillosis antigen and culture, and P jirovecii testing. The BAL samples were subjected to Giemsa and Gomori methenamine silver staining and qualitative pneumocystis DNA analysis by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for P jirovecii. Viral identification from BAL samples was performed using PCR and viral culture: reverse-transcription PCR for influenza viruses A and B, shell vial culture for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and viral culture for herpes simplex virus (HSV), parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and enterovirus. BAL culture results were deemed positive when at minimum one microorganism grew to a concentration of >104 colony-forming units per milliliter. We collected the samples of all the ARDS patients who had received BAL for microbial examination during the study period for analysis.",

Community-acquired pneumonia is the most frequent cause of ARDS and no specific bacterium has been identified to be solely responsible for pneumonia-induced ARDS (8). Although fungi are not the common cause of ARDS, some fungal pathogens such as P jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus may be responsible for ARDS in immunocompromised patients (21). In this study, the most common pathogen identified through BAL was P jirovecii (47.2%) and not a bacterium. This may be due to the patient-selection criteria and the methodological procedures used in this study. First, the indication for BAL in these pneumonia-related ARDS patients was a negative tracheal aspirate or sputum culture. Because the most common bacterial pathogens, such as S pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza, might be more readily identified from the tracheal aspirate or sputum culture of ARDS patients, they would have been excluded from this study according to the selection criteria. Second, P jirovecii was detected through BAL by using either PCR or conventional staining in this study. Studies have reported that PCR detection of P jirovecii DNA provides greater sensitivity for diagnosis compared with conventional staining (a sensitivity value of 98.3% [95% confidence interval: 91.3%\u221299.7%]) (22, 23). P jirovecii detection through BAL in ARDS patients has clinical implications and is worth further investigation; early identification and proper therapy can alter the patient outcome.",

The poor outcome in the coinfection group might be partly explained by underlying disease with a higher Charlson comorbidity index compared with that of the virus-only group (2.6 \u00b1 2.1 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 1.7; P = 0.03).

            "text": "ARDS might result from viral pneumonia, subsequent to initial viral lung infection-induced damage. Viral pneumonia can be roughly divided into two categories: community-acquired viral disease, with respiratory viruses such as influenza, rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus; and nosocomial viral disease, with Herpesviridae such as CMV and HSV (24\u201327). However, isolation of a virus through BAL is not necessarily associated with viral infection of the lung. CMV identified in the lower respiratory tract might be a reactivation but not a true lung infection. In critically ill patients, CMV reactivation has been associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU, as well as increased mortality (28\u201333). A recent study of 271 ARDS patients revealed that CMV reactivation was independently associated with ICU mortality (34). The fraction of ICU mortality attributable to CMV reactivation was 23% by day 30, which translates into an absolute increasing mortality of 4.4%. The CMV reactivation rate was 27% in these 271 ARDS patients. In the present study, CMV was the most common virus detected through BAL and was identified in 51 (35.9%) patients. The exact implication of CMV detection in the lower respiratory tract is still debated. In future studies, evaluating the efficacy of therapy directed against CMV in ARDS patients is crucial.",

It is critical to recognize the variability of pathogenic pneumonia species among different ICUs within a hospital, different hospitals, and different areas and countries. Such local epidemiologic information helps us understand and select the appropriate antimicrobial treatment for the specific clinical setting. Second, our study included patients with pneumonia-related ARDS who had negative results on tracheal aspirate or sputum culture and then received BAL for pathogen surveys. Thus, we did not study patients who had positive sputum culture results. Although quantitative BAL has a higher diagnostic yield in pathogen identification, it entails potential risks and ethical concerns in severe hypoxemic patients. In practice, it is not possible to perform BAL in all patients with pneumonia-related ARDS. Third, all of the patients had received empiric antimicrobial agents before BAL; some patients might have had false-negative results regarding bacterial culture, and consequently, the percentage of patients infected by other pathogens might have been overestimated. Fourth, the sensitivity and specificity of the available diagnostic methods used in this study are concerning. Although we performed quantitative BAL to increase the diagnostic yield in pathogen identification, it is possible to have false-negative results; for example, we did not uniformly use multiplex RT-PCR and serology study to detect respiratory viruses and some bacteria. Finally, the moderately small sample size may have influenced the statistical analysis and cannot represent the entire pneumonia-related ARDS population. Despite the limited number of study patients, this is one of the largest studies with BAL sampling of pneumonia-related ARDS patients thus far reported.",
