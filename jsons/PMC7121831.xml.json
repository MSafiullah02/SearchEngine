            "text": "Inflammation is defined as the normal response of living tissue to injury or infection. It is important to emphasize two components of this definition. First, that inflammation is a normal response and, as such, is expected to occur when tissue is damaged. Infact, if injured tissue does not exhibit signs of inflammation this would be considered abnormal and wounds and infections would never heal without inflammation. Secondly, inflammation occurs in living tissue, hence there is need for an adequate blood supply to the tissues in order to exhibit an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response may be triggered by mechanical injury, chemical toxins, and invasion by microorganisms, and hypersensitivity reactions. Three major events occur during the inflammatory response: the blood supply to the affected area is increased substantially, capillary permeability is increased, and leucocytes migrate from the capillary vessels into the surrounding interstitial spaces to the site of inflammation or injury. The inflammatory response represents a complex biological and biochemical process involving cells of the immune system and a plethora of biological mediators. Cell-to-cell communication molecules such as cytokines play an extremely important role in mediating the process of inflammation. Inflammation and platelet activation are critical phenomena in the setting of acute coronary syndromes. An extensive exposition of this complex phenomenon is beyond the scope of this article (Rankin 2004).",

            "text": "Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process. However, chronic inflammation can also lead to a host of diseases, such as hay fever, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and even cancer (e.g., gallbladder carcinoma). It is for that reason that inflammation is normally closely regulated by the body. Acute and chronic inflammation differ in matter of causative agent, major cells involved, primary mediators, onset, duration and final outcomes. Generally speaking, acute inflammation is mediated by granulocytes, while chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes.",

            "text": "The selectin family of lectins consists of three closely related cell-surface molecules with differential expression by leukocytes (L-selectin), platelets (P-selectin), and vascular endothelium (E- and P-selectin). Structural identity of a selectins resides in its unique domain composition (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_26). E-, P-, and L-selectin are >60 % identical in their NH2 terminus of 120 amino acids, which represent the lectin domain (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_26, 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_27, and 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_28). The ligands (counter structures) of selectins are sialylated and fucosylated carbohydrate molecules which, in most cases, decorate mucin-like glycoprotein membrane receptors. Their common structure consists of an N-terminal Ca2+-dependent lectin-type domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, multiple short consensus repeat (SCR) domains similar to those found in complement regulatory proteins, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Together this arrangement results in an elongated structure which projects from the cell surface, ideal for initiating interactions with circulating leucocytes. The lectin domain forms the main ligand binding site, interacting with a carbohydrate determinant typified by fucosylated, sialylated, and usually sulphated glycans such as sialyl Lewis X (s-LeX). The EGF domain may also play a role in ligand recognition. The short consensus repeat (SCR) domains (two for L-selectin, six for E-selectin, and nine for P-selectin) probably act as spacer elements, ensuring optimum positioning of the lectin and EGF domains for ligand interaction. The EGF repeats have comparable sequence similarity. Each complement regulatory-like module is 60 amino acids in length and contains six cysteinyl residues capable of disulfide bond formation. This feature distinguishes the selectin modules from those found in complement binding proteins, such as complement receptors 1 and 2, which contain four cysteines (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_26).",

Selectins (P, E and L) and their ligands (mainly P-selectin ligand) are involved in the rolling and tethering of leukocytes on the vascular wall. Activation of endothelial cells (EC) with different stimuli induces the expression of E- and P-selectins, and other adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), involved in their interaction with circulating cells. Lymphocytes home to peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) via high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the subcortex and incrementally larger collecting venules in the medulla. HEVs express ligands for L-selectin, which mediates lymphocyte rolling (Horstman et al. 2004). For structure and functions of selectins, the readers are advised to consult Chaps 26\u201328. In this chapter we will emphasize mainly on the role of selectins in inflammatory disorders including cancer.",

            "text": "Venous Thrombosis is a world wide health problem in the general population. Injury to the endothelium leads to dysfunction. The causes of injury include lipids, immune complexes, microorganisms, smoking, hypertension, aging, diabetes mellitus and trauma. The selectins are thought to be largely responsible for the initial attachment and rolling of leukocytes on stimulated vascular endothelium. Platelet activation is an important process in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation at the sites of vascular endothelial disruption caused by atherosclerosis are key events in arterial thrombus formation. Platelet tethering and adhesion to the arterial wall, particularly under high shear forces, are achieved through multiple high-affinity interactions between platelet membrane receptors (integrins) and ligands within the exposed subendothelium, most notably collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Platelet adhesion to collagen occurs both indirectly, via binding of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX receptor to circulating vWF, which binds to exposed collagen, and directly, via interaction with platelet receptors GP VI and GP Ia/IIb. Platelet activation, initiated by exposed collagen and locally generated soluble platelet agonists (primarily thrombin, ADP, and thromboxane A2), provides the stimulus for the release of platelet-derived growth factors, adhesion molecules and coagulation factors, activation of adjacent platelets, and conformational changes in the platelet \u03b1(IIb)\u03b23 integrin (GP IIb/IIIa receptor). Platelet aggregation, mediated primarily by interaction between the activated platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor and its ligands, fibrinogen and vWF, results in the formation of a platelet-rich thrombus (Steinhubl and Moliterno 2005).",

            "text": "P-selectin expression in platelets is elevated in disorders associated with arterial thrombosis such as coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. During thrombosis, P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets. P-selectin mediates rolling of platelets and leukocytes on activated endothelial cells as well as interactions of platelets with leukocytes. Platelet P-selectin interacts with PSGL-1 on leukocytes to form platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Furthermore, this interaction of P-selectin with PSGL-1 induces the upregulation of tissue factor, several cytokines in leukocytes and the production of procoagulant microparticles, thereby contributing to a prothrombotic state. P-selectin is also involved in platelet-platelet interactions, i. e. platelet aggregation which is a major factor in arterial thrombosis. P-selectin interacts with platelet sulfatides, thereby stabilizing initial platelet aggregates formed by GPIIb/IIIa-fibrinogen bridges. Inhibtion of the P-selectin-sulfatide interaction leads to a reversal of platelet aggregation. Thus, P-selectin plays a significant role in platelet aggregation and platelet- leukocyte interactions, both important mechanisms in the development of arterial thrombosis. Following activation, P-selectin is rapidly translocated to the cell surface (Merten and Thiagarajan 2004; Wang et al. 2005).",

The venous plasma levels of sP-selectin in patients with moderate-to-severe MS are significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers or patients with lone AF. In addition, in patients with MS, there was no difference in the plasma levels of sP-selectin between the left and right atrial blood and between peripheral and atrial blood. Moreover, there was no change in sP-selectin levels as a result of percutaneous transluminal mitral valvuloplasty (PTMV) (Chen et al. 2004). Lip et al. (2005) studied the relations of plasma vWf (an index of endothelial damage and dysfunction) and sP-selectin levels in relation to the presence and onset of clinical congestive heart failure (CHF) and degree of left ventricular dysfunction in patients taking part in SPAF (stroke prevention in AF). While plasma vWf was higher among patients with AF and CHF, plasma P-selectin concentrations were not affected by presence, onset, or severity of heart failure.",

            "text": "In recent years, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered as initial event in causing atherosclerosis. ROS are a family of molecules including molecular oxygen and its derivatives produced in all aerobic cells. Excessive production of ROS, outstripping endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, has been implicated in processes in which they oxidize biological macromolecules, such as DNA, protein, carbohydrates, and lipids. Many ROS possess unpaired electrons and thus are free radicals. These include molecules such as superoxide anion (O2\u2212), hydroxyl radical (HO\u2022), nitric oxide (NO\u2022), and lipid radicals. Other reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), are not free radicals per se but have oxidizing effects that contribute to oxidant stress. The cellular production of one ROS may lead to the production of several others via radical chain reactions. For example, reactions between radicals and polyunsaturated fatty acids within cell membrane may result in a fatty acid peroxyl radical (R-COO\u2022) that can attack adjacent fatty acid side chains and initiate production of other lipid radicals. Lipid radicals produced in this chain reaction accumulate in the cell membrane and may have a myriad of effects on cellular function, including leakage of the plasmolemma and dysfunction of membrane-bound receptors. Of note, end products of lipid peroxidation, including unsaturated aldehydes and other metabolites, have cytotoxic and mutagenic properties. A decline in NO bioavailability may be caused by decreased expression of the endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS), a lack of substrate or cofactors for eNOS (Fig. 44.1 and 44.2).\n\n",

Four polymorphisms (Ser290Asn, Asn562Asp, Leu599Val and Thr715Pro) predicted a change in the amino acid sequence of P-selectin. In patients with MI from four regions of France and Northern Ireland (the ECTIM study) the P-selectin polymorphisms provided a heterozygosity of 91 %. The polymorphisms were tightly associated with one another and displayed patterns of linkage disequilibrium suggesting the existence of highly conserved ancestral haplotypes.

Reports indicated that screening for CD14-260 C/T genotypes is unlikely to be a useful tool for risk assessment and it remains unclear whether CD14 polymorphisms significantly increase the risk of MI. The A252G polymorphism of lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LTA) gene, a member of the TNF family, is strongly related with the onset of AMI (Auer et al. 2003).

This suggests that in disorders such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, in which both complement and P-selectin have been shown to play a role, complement activation is a primary event and the effects of P-selectin are secondary. In mouse kidney model of I/R injury, results indicated that complement and P-selectin-mediated pathways of renal reperfusion injury are mutually independent (Farrar et al. 2004). Induction of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) might contribute to the superior outcome following stenting and early intervention compared to conventional balloon angioplasty (PTCA). A substantial increase in sE-selectin levels early after PTCA and stent implantation may predict development of restenosis (Heider et al. 2006; Kilickap et al. 2004). After reperfusion of myocardial vessels, P-selectin expressed on majority of vessels (77 %) though the expression decreased during subsequent remaining duration of reperfusion (Chukwuemeka et al. 2005). In rats, the mRNA expression for several genes was associated with inflammation after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Gene expression increased in the injured hemisphere for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and ICAM-1. TNF-\u03b1 mRNA was upregulated in the injured versus uninjured hemisphere, while E-selectin mRNA showed a significant increase from 6 to 24 h after MCAO (Berti et al. 2002). Both P-selectin and LFA-1 may be important targets to control pathologic inflammation in I/R-induced tissue injury in the colon (Riaz et al. 2002). The study in intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury (IR/I) using murine models demonstrated the importance of P-selectin in warm and cold IR/I. The blockade of P-selectin using rPSGL1-lg or the absence of P-selectin KO mice confers a survival advantage and reduction in tissue injury. The mechanism appears to be independent of neutrophil infiltration (Carmody et al. 2004). Enterocyte apoptosis is increased following intestinal I/R injury. Hyperoxia following intestinal I/R in rat increased E-selectin expression in the jejunum and ileum and a concomitant increase in neutrophil recruitment in the ileum, accompanied by increased cell apoptosis (Braun et al. 2004; Sukhotnik et al. 2008). Germ cell-specific apoptosis that occurs after I/R of murine testis is dependent on neutrophil recruitment to the testis and is dependent on E-selectin. Blockage of E-selectin may be a strategy to treat post-ischaemic testis (Celebi and Paul 2008).",

The cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), which is expressed on peripheral skin-homing helper memory T cells in healthy persons, is at least partly the sialyl 6-sulfo Lex determinant (Ohmori et al. 2006) and a ligand for selectins. The differential polyadenylation of E-selectin transcripts may provide the molecular basis for the observed chronic expression of E-selectin in human dermal disorders. In atopic dermatitis, patients express ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, E-selectin and L-selectin (60 %) in the dermis, without expression of E- and L-selectins in the epidermis. A high expression of adhesion molecules in the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (Lugovic et al. 2006). The blood markers for atopic dermatitis, including soluble forms of E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were reduced after treatment with cetiridine (Izu and Tokura 2005). The extracts from dust mites, Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus and Euroglyphus maynei with and without endotoxin (LPS) stimulated endothelial cells to express ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin and to secrete IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and GM-CSF. Serum levels of sE-selectin are higher in children with measles than in children with atopic dermatitis, atopic asthma and healthy controls. But it was not correlated with measles. There was no correlation between sE-selectin and TNF-\u03b1 level (Park et al. 2008). Pollinosis from Parietaria judaica is one of the main causes of allergy in the Mediterranean area. The treatment of endothelial cells with pollen extract causes an increase of E-selectin and VCAM-1 protein levels as well as an increase of IL-8 production. The stimulation of cell adhesion molecules was paralleled by an increase of adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to HMVEC-L monolayer (Taverna et al. 2008).",

Studies suggest that P-selectin has a substantial role in the pathogenesis of the lung injury induced by LPS (Ohnishi et al. 1999). In bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice, the L-selectin and/or ICAM-1 deficiency inhibited skin and lung fibrosis with decreased Th2 and Th17 cytokines and increased Th1 cytokines. In contrast, P-selectin deficiency, E-selectin deficiency with or without P-selectin blockade, or PSGL-1 deficiency augmented the fibrosis in parallel with increased Th2 and Th17 cytokines and decreased Th1 cytokines. Yoshizaki et al. (2010) suggest that L-selectin and ICAM-1 regulate Th2 and Th17 cell accumulation in skin and the lung, leading to the development of fibrosis, and that P-selectin, E-selectin, and PSGL-1 regulate Th1 cell infiltration, resulting in the inhibition of fibrosis (Yoshizaki et al. 2010). Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears to develop as the acute lung injury in the course of many severe diseases, as the result of damage of alveolar-capillary barrier. Clinical observations suggest that analysis of E-, P-selectin and ICAM-1 concentrations in the serum of patients with ARDS may be helpful in monitoring the course and treatment of the disease (Skiba-Choi\u0144ska and Rogowski 1996). In the pathogenesis of paracoccidioidomycosis, Gonzalez et al.

ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin are newly synthesized prior to spontaneous asthma attacks, and their expression may play a key role in eosinophil infiltration into the airway (Ohkawara et al. 1995). Crude extract of D. farinae induces ICAM-1 expression in EoL-1 cells through signaling pathways involving both NF-kB and JNK (Kwon et al. 2007). Kirchberger et al. (2006) demonstrated that signaling via ICAM-1 induces adhesiveness of mononuclear phagocytes, which critically involves PECAM-1 and is mediated via LFA-1/ICAM-3. The most common acute infection in humans, Human Rhinovirus (HRV) is a leading cause of exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstruction pulmonary disease. ICAM-1 is a critical target-docking molecule on epithelial cells for 90 % HRV serotypes. ICAM-1 regulates not only viral entry and replication but also signaling pathways that lead to inflammatory mediator production (Lau et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008). The sICAM-1 but not sE-selectin from patients with asthma is significantly higher than healthy controls. Although serum levels of sICAM-1 are higher in asthmatics, it may be necessary to establish individual baseline values for serial estimation to evaluate their clinical relevance (Bijanzadeh et al. 2009). The serum levels of sICAM-1 were significantly higher in obese nonasthmatic and obese asthmatic children versus control and lean asthmatic children (Huang et al. 2008). P-selectin is an important controller of the inflammation by mediating selective eosinophil cell influx to the lung. It can be used as a sensitive marker in mild asthma (Sjosward et al. 2004).",

Diabetes mellitus type 1 (Type 1 diabetes or T1DM, also called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\u2014IDDM, or, formerly, juvenile diabetes) is a form of diabetes mellitus that results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells of the pancreas. The chronic hyperglycemic state in T1DM patients produces an aggression to vascular endothelium leading to a premature development of atherosclerosis. In both boys and girls, sE-selectin is an early marker of endothelial dysfunction and a probable risk marker of atherosclerosis in children with T1DM (Carrizo et al. 2008). The levels of C-reactive protein, E-selectin, and cytokines in association with severity index were significantly increased in T1DM and type 1 diabetic patients with microvascular complications (T1DM-MV patients) compared with control subjects (Devaraj et al. 2007). Nerve microvasculitis and ischemic injury appear to be the primary and important pathogenic alterations in lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN) of patients with diabetes mellitus (DLRPN) and without diabetes mellitus (LRPN). The up-regulation of inflammatory mediators target different cells at different disease stages and that these mediators may be sequentially involved in an immune-mediated inflammatory process that is shared by both DLRPN and LRPN (Kawamura et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Considerable evidence indicates that patients with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at greater risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular mortality is increased in RA patients. The markers proposed for assessing RA activity include rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies, IgM anti-IgG advanced glycation end products, markers of bone/cartilage metabolism, mannose-binding lectin, E-selectin, IL-6, and leptin. Various studies have investigated the correlation between some of these markers and other variables that might indicate disease activity, e.g., inflammatory activity tests and disease activity scores. However, there is as yet insufficient evidence that any of these markers, in isolation or in combination, are useful in the assessment of RA activity. Many numerous endothelial cells become positive for E-selectin and E-selectin mRNA in RA synovial membranes and the E-selectin expression appeared to correlate with inflammatory activity. P-selectin deficiency in mice resulted in accelerated onset of joint inflammation in the murine collagen-immunized arthritis model. Mice deficient either in E-selectin or in E- selectin and P-selectin (E/P-selectin mutant) also exhibit accelerated development of arthritis compared with wild type mice in CIA model. The strong vascular expression of E-selectin indicates an activation of endothelial cells in the recruitment of cells associated with the chronic inflammation of RA (Foster et al. 2009; da Mota et al. 2009). E-Selectin and ICAM-1 are upregulated on the synovial endothelium, while VCAM-1 plays an important role in synovial lining layer cells and within the synovial stroma. The expression of CAMs may be blocked by mAbs and modified by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. (Cobankara et al. 2004). Serum soluble adhesion molecules concentrations are down-regulated following anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody therapy combined with methotrexate (MTX) (Klimiuk et al. 2004, 2007; Lev\u00e4lampi et al. 2007; Bosello et al. 2008).",

P-selectin deficiency in mice results in accelerated onset of joint inflammation in the murine collagen-immunized arthritis model. Mice deficient either in E-selectin or in E-selectin and P-selectin (E/P-selectin mutant) also exhibit accelerated development of arthritis compared with wild type mice, suggesting that these adhesion molecules perform overlapping functions in regulating joint disease.

Results suggest that both the LFA-1/ICAM-1, ICAM-3 and VLA-4/VCAM-1 pathways could play a relevant role in autoimmune thyroid disorders (Marazuela et al. 1994). In patients with GD, the 721 G-A polymorphism was associated with an earlier age of GD onset (before age 40) and that the 1405A-G polymorphism could predispose to Graves ophthalmopathy. It was concluded that G241R and K469E amino acid substitutions in the ICAM1 molecule could influence the intensity/duration of the autoimmunity process and the infiltration of orbital tissues (Kretowski et al. 2003).

VCAM-1 is not altered in in mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regardless of the activity of the inflammatory process. In contrast, E-selectin was not detected in normal colonic mucosa or in colonic mucosa of patients with IBD. However, high levels of E-selectin were consistently found on endothelial surfaces in association with active inflammation in affected areas of colonic mucosa in patients with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis. In addition, E-selectin appeared to be present within neutrophils which had migrated into crypt abscesses in affected mucosa. Thus E-selectin may play an important role in facilitating leukocyte migration into sites of active IBD involvement (Koizumi et al. 1992)",

Severe fibrosis and increased expression of profibrotic cytokines are important hallmarks in the gastric wall of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). The CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio is significantly increased in SSc specimens. T cells strongly express the activation markers VLA-4, LFA-1, and ICAM-1. Endothelial cells showed corresponding surface activation with strong expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. These results provide the evidence that endothelial/lymphocyte activation leading to prominent CD4+ T cell infiltration may play a key pathogenetic role within the gastric wall of patients with SSc (Manetti et al. 2008). In patients with SSc with and without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sP-selectin and sPECAM-1 levels were higher than in healthy donors (HD) at baseline and fell to normal values after 12 months of bosentan therapy. Endothelial activation occurs in SSc, and that changes in the T cell/endothelium interplay take place in SSc-associated PAH. Bosentan seems to be able to hamper these changes and restore T cell functions in these patients (Iannone et al. 2008).",

Significant elevation in sICAM-1 is also detected in patients with inactive alcoholic cirrhosis, suggesting that impaired liver may, in part, account for the increased serum level in patients with autoimmune liver disease. In contrast, sE-selectin did not differ significantly from healthy controls. Although, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) may be a source of sICAM-1, Thomson et al.

An increased level of sE-selectin in patients susceptible to restenosis supports a role for white blood cell/endothelial interaction in restenosis after angioplasty (Sainani and Maru 2005). The impairment of vascular endothelial function was obvious in uremic patients with maintaining hemodialysis (MHD). The changes of ICAM-1 and E-selectin could be accepted as biochemical criterions of vascular endothelial injury (Li et al. 2005). Diuresis, serum creatinine, urea, and enzyme elimination are pathological among patients with acute renal failure (ARF). Higher elimination rates of sICAM-1 and higher values of sE-selectin compared to patients without ARF indicated additional parameters for early signs of kidney damage (Dehne et al. 2008). Both circulating and urinary TNF-\u03b1 levels are increased in inflammatory chronic renal diseases. TNF-\u03b1 appeared to play a crucial role in the immunopathogenesis of nephritis by the induction of chemokine, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression via the activation of the intracellular MAPK signaling pathway, which may contribute to macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration (Ho et al. 2008; Li et al. 2008).",

Chronic allograft failure (CAF) is the major cause for late graft loss in renal transplantation. ICAM-1 polymorphisms may represent a predetermined genetic risk factor for CAF. This was substantiated by the polymorphism in exon 4 at the Mac-1 binding site and in exon 6 at fifth Ig-like domain (McLaren et al. 1999). Khazen et al. (2007) found no evidence for an association of any polymorphism with acute rejection in E- and L-selectin. During kidney reperfusion, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 concentrations correlated positively with hypoxanthine concentrations during reperfusion, whereas concentrations of ICAM-1 correlated negatively with xanthine concentrations, indicating metabolic changes in renal tissue (Domanski et al. 2009).",

Furthermore, sP-selectin levels were negatively correlated with impaired social development during early childhood (Iwata et al. 2008). In multiple sclerosis and in its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), inflammatory cells migrate across the endothelial blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and gain access to the CNS. The role of E- and P-selectin in this process has been controversial. D\u00f6ring et al. (2007) suggest that absence of E- and P-selectin did neither influence the activation of myelin-specific T cells nor the composition of the cellular infiltrates in the CNS during EAE. Thus, E- and P-selectin are not required for leukocyte recruitment across BBB and the development of EAE in C57BL/6 and in SJL mice (D\u00f6ring et al. 2007). No significant differences in allelic or genotypic frequency in all the SNPs (rs6133, rs4987310 and rs5368 substitutions) tested were found in the Italian population (Fenoglio et al. 2009).",

Reduction of endogenous Gb3 by treatment of the cells with an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid synthase or \u03b1-galactosidase A led to decreased expression of adhesion molecules.

The CAMs in the process of inflammation are responsible for recruiting leukocytes onto the vascular endothelium before extravasation to the injured tissues. Some circulating cancer cells have been shown to extravasate to a secondary site using a process similar to inflammatory cells. The most studied ligands for CAMs expressed on cancer cells, s-Lewisa and s-Lewisx antigens, are shown to be involved in adhesion to endothelial cells by binding to E-selectin. This process, shared by inflammatory cells and cancer cells, may partially explain the link between inflammation and tumorigenesis. The adhesion of colon cancer cells to E-selectin can be directly affected by changes in the expression level of sialosyl Lea antigen. The specific lack of expression of sialosyl Lea carbohydrate structure on the surface of colon cancer cells completely abolished their adhesion to E-selectin. It is proposed that glycoproteins as well as gangliosides carrying sialosyl Lea structures, when properly exposed and present in high density on surface of cancer cells, can effectively support the adhesion of cancer cells to E-selectin (Klopocki et al. 1998; Kobayashi et al. 2007). In addition to endogenous ligands for L-, P-, and E-selectins (10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_26, 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_27, and 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_28), several proteins are found in cancer cell lines or solid tumors that act as ligands for E, L, and P selectins.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are pericytes of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are involved in the repair of liver tissue injury and angiogenesis of liver metastases. HSC express FGF-R together with FucT7 and exhibit a functional E-selectin binding activity on their cell surface (Antoine et al. 2009). (3) Although B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cell lines do not express the ligand PSGL-1, a major proportion of carbohydrate selectin ligand was carried by another sialomucin, CD43, in NALL-1 cells. CD43 plays an important role in extravascular infiltration of NALL-1 cells and the degree of tissue engraftment of BCP-ALL cells may be controlled by manipulating CD43 expression (Nonomura et al. 2008). (4) Thomas et al. (2009a) identified podocalyxin-like protein (PCLP) as an alternative selectin ligand. PCLP on LS174T colon carcinoma cells possesses E-/L-, but not P-, selectin binding activity. PCLP functions as an alternative acceptor for selectin-binding glycans. The finding that PCLP is an E-/L-selectin ligand on carcinoma cells offers a unifying perspective on the apparent enhanced metastatic potential associated with tumor cell PCLP overexpression and the role of selectins in metastasis (Thomas et al. 2009b). (5) E-selectin has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell interactions between breast cancer cells and endothelial monolayers during tumor cell metastasis.

Furthermore, a ~180-kDa sialofucosylated glycoprotein(s) mediated selectin binding in CD44-knockdown cells. This glycoprotein was identified as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA serves as an auxiliary L-selectin ligand, which stabilizes L-selectin-dependent cell rolling against fluid shear (Thomas et al. 2009b). Zen et al.

Gastrin-17 (G17) has marked proangiogenic effects in vivo on experimental gliomas and in vitro on HUVECs and transiently decreased the expression of E-selectin, but not P-selectin, whereas IL-8 increased the expression of E-selectin. Specific antisense oligonucleotides against E- and P-selectin decreased HUVEC tubulogenesis processes in vitro. This showed that gastrin has marked proangiogenic effects in vivo on experimental gliomas and in vitro on HUVECs. This effect depends in part on the level of E-selectin activation, but not on IL-8 expression/release by HUVECs (Lefranc et al. 2004).",

Extravasation is initiated by the loose adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells via an interaction between endothelial selectins and selectin ligands expressed by the tumor cells. Metastatic spreading is a dreadful complication of neoplastic diseases that is responsible for most deaths due to cancer. It consists in the formation of secondary neoplasms from cancer cells that have detached from the primary site. Leukocytes and tumor cells use E-selectin binding ligands to attach to activated endothelial cells expressing E-selectin during inflammation or metastasis. The formation of these secondary sites is not random and several clinical observations indicate that the metastatic colonization exhibits organ selectivity. This organ tropism relies mostly on the complementary adhesive interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. E-selectin and sLewis antigens might play important role in breast tumor, lymph node and liver metastasis. High levels of sE-selectin have been reported in melanoma and some epithelial tumors, especially in colorectal carcinoma. But sE-selectin may not be used as a predictive marker of metastasis in colorectal carcinoma, though high levels of sE-selectin may support diagnosis of liver metastasis (Uner et al. 2004; Eichbaum et al. 2004). It appeared that serum levels of sE-selectin are associated with the clinical course of liver metastases from breast cancer. Eichbaum et al.

Carbohydrate antigen sLea (CA19-9) is the most frequently applied serum tumor marker for diagnosis of cancers in the digestive organs. The normal counterpart of the determinant, namely disialyl-Lea is predominantly expressed in non-malignant epithelial cells of the digestive organs. The disialyl-Lea determinant carries one extra sialic residue attached through a 2 \u2192 6 linkage to GlcNAc moiety compared to cancer-associated sLea, which carries only one 2 \u2192 3 linked sialic acid residue (monosialyl Lewis A) (Fig. 44.3). Disialyl-Lea in normal epithelial cells serves as a ligand for immunosuppressive receptors such as sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins (siglec-7 and -9) expressed on resident monocytes/macrophages and maintains immunological homeostasis of mucosal membranes in digestive organs. Epigenetic silencing of a gene for a 2 \u2192 6 sialyl-transferase in the early stages of carcinogenesis results in impairment of 2 \u2192 6 sialylation, leading to incomplete synthesis and accumulation of sLea, which lacks the 2 \u2192 6 linked sialic acid residue, in cancer cells. Simultaneous determination of serum levels of sLea and disialyl-Lea, and calculation of the sLea/disialyl-Lea ratio provides information useful for excluding a false-positive serum diagnosis. During cancer progression in locally advanced cancers, tumor hypoxia induces transcription of several glyco genes involved in sLea synthesis. Expression of the determinant, consequently, is further accelerated in more malignant hypoxia-resistant cancer cell clones, which become predominant clones in advanced stage cancers and frequently develop hematogenous metastasis. sLea, as well as its positional isomer sLea, serves as a ligand for vascular E-selectin and facilitates hematogenous metastasis through mediating adhesion of circulating cancer cells to vascular endothelium. Patients having both strong sLea expression on cancer cells and enhanced E-selectin expression on vascular beds are at a greater risk of developing distant hematogenous metastasis (Kannagi 2007). In a human-mouse model, the selectin ligand s-Lea is involved in in vivo extravasation of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. Highly metastatic CRC cells expressing high levels of s-Lea extravasate more efficiently than non-metastatic CRC cells expressing low levels of s-Lea. Down-regulating the expression of s-Lea in CRC cells by genetic manipulations, significantly reduced CRC extravasation. The arrest and adhesion of CRC cells, and possibly of other types of cancer cells as well, to endothelium depend on the expression of the selectin ligand sLea by the tumor cells (Ben-David et al. 2008). 3'-Sulfo-Lea is known to be the potent ligand of E-selectin which is important in cell adhesion and migration. The serum 3'-sulfo-Lea can provide important information in patients with primary gastric cancer, which might be useful as a predictive marker especially for the detection of tumor metastasis (Zheng et al. 2009).\n",

            "text": "\nEndothelial P-Selectin as a Target of Heparin Action: Metastasis can be effectively inhibited by the anticoagulant heparin in different tumor models. At the cellular level, many of the antimetastatic effects of heparin in vivo are due to its action on P-selectin-mediated binding. Ludwig et al. (2007) addressed the potential contribution of endothelial P-selectin expression to adhesive events between the microvasculature and melanoma cells in vivo. Heparin not only inhibits P-selectin-mediated melanoma cell rolling but also attenuates melanoma metastasis formation in vivo, supporting the concept that endothelial P-selectin expression may represent an additional target of heparin in experimental melanoma lung metastasis (Ludwig et al. 2007). The low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) significantly improved colonic inflammation in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis. The effect is possibly related to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, but not involved platelet surface P-selectin expression (Xia et al. 2004). The survival benefits in patients with cancer treated with LMWH may result from a LMWH-mediated effect on the immune system or on the cross-talk between platelets and tumor cells. However, survival observed with LMWH in patients with cancer apparently cannot be explained by a LMWH effect on these circulating markers (Di Nisio et al. 2005). Nonetheless, in vivo anti-metastatic effects of heparins reflect their action on P-selectin-mediated binding. Therefore, these commonly used anticoagulants widely differ in their potential to interfere with P-selectin mediated cell binding. Importantly, the superior inhibitory capacity on P-selectin function of unfractionated heparin and LMWH nadroparin as opposed to LMWH enoxaparin and synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux strongly correlated to the inhibitory potency of each in inhibiting experimental lung metastasis in vivo. Hence, P-selectin inhibition constitutes a valuable feature to identify anticoagulants that are suitable for anticancer therapy (Ludwig et al. 2006). Stevenson et al. (2005) studied metastasis inhibition by clinically relevant levels of various heparins and investigated the structural basis for selectin inhibition differences. Five clinically approved heparins were evaluated for inhibition of P-selectin and L-selectin binding to carcinoma cells and showed differing abilities to inhibit selectins, likely explained by size distribution. It should be possible to size fractionate heparins and inhibit selectins at concentrations that do not have a large effect on coagulation. Gao et al. (2005) prepared periodate-oxidized, borohydride-reduced heparin (RO-heparin) and tested its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activities. Compared with heparin, RO-heparin had greatly reduced anticoagulant activity. Intravenous administration of this compound led to reduction in the peritoneal infiltration of neutrophils in a mouse acute inflammation model. In vitro studies showed that the effect of RO-heparin on inflammatory responses was mainly due to inhibiting the interaction of P-selectin with its ligands. These results indicate that RO-heparin may be a safer treatment for inflammation than heparin, especially when selectin is targeted.",

            "text": "To clarify the mechanism of heparin antimetastatic activity, several biological effects are being investigated. Cancer progression and metastasis are associated with enhanced expression of heparanase, which is inhibited efficiently by heparin. Heparin is also a potent inhibitor of selectin-mediated interactions. P- and L-selectin were shown to contribute to the early stages of metastasis, which is associated with platelet-tumor cell thrombi formation. Low anticoagulant heparin preparations still inhibited metastasis efficiently indicating that anticoagulation is not a necessary component for heparin attenuation of metastasis. Modified heparins characterized for heparanase inhibitory activity are also potential inhibitors of selectins. Selectin inhibition is a clear component of heparin inhibition of metastasis. The contribution of selectin or heparanase inhibition by heparin can provide evidence about its antimetastatic activity (Borsig 2007). One of the mechanisms by which heparin inhibits metastasis is by blocking the P-selectin-based interaction of platelets with tumor cell. The sulfate groups at C6/N and especially C6, but not C2 and C3, of heparin play a critical role in P-selectin recognition and that 2-O,3-O-desulfated heparin can block P-selectin-mediated A375 human melanoma cell adhesion. Thus chemical modification of heparin, especially 2-O,3-O-desulfation, may result in a therapeutic agent that is anti-metastatic because it blocks unwanted P-selectin-dependent adhesion but that lacks dose-limiting anticoagulant effects (Wei et al. 2005).",

The activation products from these sites also contribute to the activation of coagulation and to the fibrinolytic deficit. Many of the markers of hemostatic activation processes have been found to be at increased levels during acute phases of the HIT syndromes. Since the pathophysiology of HIT involves the activation of platelets, endothelium, and leukocytes, it is expected that activation products related to these hemostatic systems, including soluble selectins, will also be increased in circulating blood. These alterations may provide an index of the pathophysiologic process. Fareed et al. (1999) reviewed on the circulating levels of P-, E-, and L-selectins in HIT patients and their modulation after therapeutic intervention. With the availability of recombinant hirudin, it is now possible to provide alternate anticoagulants to HIT patients. However, Fareed et al.

Release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of CAMs and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. It has been proposed that the infection of endothelial cells with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis induces surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and monocyte adhesion. In general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion should be viewed as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. These cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses (Golias et al. 2007). Helicobacter pylori is a common bacterial pathogen that infects world's population up to 50 %. Carbohydrate components on H. pylori (sequences related to Lex or Lea antigens) are responsible for the persistent inflammation through interactions with leukocyte-endothelial adhesion molecules of the host. H. pylori isolates from patients with chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer interact with E- and L-selectins (Galustian et al. 2003). Expression of E-selectin was specifically upregulated in H. pylori-induced gastritis but not in gastritis induced by acetylsalicylic acid or pouchitis. The upregulated E-selectin expression was localized to the gastric mucosa rather than being a systemic response to the infection (Svensson et al. 2009).",

(1996), in contrast, found that mice with null mutations in both endothelial selectins (P and E) develop a phenotype of leukocyte adhesion deficiency characterized by mucocutaneous infections in response to intraperitoneal S. pneumoniae peritonitis. These mice provide strong evidence for the functional importance of selectins in vivo (Bullard et al. 1996). Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a key virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, enhanced VCAM-1 expression on primary human endothelial cells suggesting a causative link between dysregulated adhesion molecule expression and the poor immune response and vasculitis associated with anthrax. Results suggest that LT can differentially modulate NF-kB target genes and highlight the importance of VCAM-1 enhancement (Warfel and D'Agnillo 2008). Vascular endothelium stimulation in vitro that lead to the upregulation of CAMs is known for the pathogenic spirochaetes, including rLIC10365 of Leptospira interrogans. The recombinant proteins of L. interrogans in E. coli as a host were capable to promote the upregulation of ICAM-1 and E-selectin on monolayers of HUVECS. In addition, pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira are both capable to stimulate endothelium E-selectin and ICAM-1, but the pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain promoted a higher activation than the non-pathogenic L. biflexa serovar Patoc (Atzingen et al. 2009; G\u00f3mez et al. 2008).

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative bacterium that is an important etiologic agent of human adult periodontitis. E. coli LPS and isoforms of P. gingivalis LPS were potent in stimulating the expression of inflammatory markers, with E. coli LPS being more potent (Liu et al. 2008). DNA samples from blood of periodontitis patients genotyped for E-selectin Ser128Arg and L-selectin Phe206Leu revealed a significant difference in the Ser128Arg polymorphism of E-selectin, but not in L-selectin, between periodontal patients and controls; the 128Arg allele was present more frequently in patients. Houshmand et al. (2009) suggested that Ser128Arg polymorphism of E-selectin might contribute to the susceptibility of Iranian individuals to periodontitis.",

Infection with hyphae stimulates endothelial cells to synthesize E-selectin, VCAM-1, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 in vitro. In neutropenic mice infected with wild-type A. fumigatus, increased pulmonary expression of E-selectin and TNF-\u03b1occurred only when neutropenia had resolved. In nonneutropenic mice immunosuppressed with corticosteroids, A. fumigatus stimulated earlier pulmonary expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1, while expression of ICAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1 was suppressed.

Trends of positive correlations were observed between sP-selectin or vWF and temperature (Matondo et al. 2008).

Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with the disease severity (Esterre et al. 1998). Studies in several models of inflammation have underscored the importance of P- and E-selectins in the migration of T cells to inflamed tissues. CD4+ T cells recruited to the cutaneous compartment during infection with Leishmania major express P- and E-selectin ligands. Results suggest that by blocking P- and E-selectins, the immune pathology associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis might be ameliorated without compromising immunity to infection (Zaph and Scott 2003). Invasive amebiasis offers a new model that poses an inadequate immune response leading to a continuous and prolonged activation of endothelial cells (ECs) by amebas, amebic molecules and cytokines, leading to necrosis. Hyperactivated endothelial cells continuously express ICAM-1 and E-selectin, pro-coagulant molecules (tissue factor, vWF, and the plasminogen activator inhibitor), resulting in ever greater inflammation and thrombosis (Campos-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2009)",

Interfering with either leukocyte adhesion or upregulation of adhesion protein is an important therapeutic target as evidenced by the potent anti-inflammatory actions of neutralizing antibodies to these ligands in various animal models and in patients. The induction of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 genes requires the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Pharmaceutical agents, which prevent the induced expression of one or more of cell adhesion molecules on endothelium, might be expected to provide a novel mechanism to attenuate the inflammatory responses associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. E-selectin expression is induced on the endothelial cell surface of vessels in response to inflammatory stimuli but is absent in the normal vessels. Thus, E-selectin is an attractive molecular target, and high affinity ligands for E-selectin could be powerful tools for the delivery of therapeutics and/or imaging agents to inflamed vessels. Zimmerman and Blanco (2008) reviewed the structure and regulation of LFA-1 and different classes of inhibitors that interfere LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions. Alicaforsen (ISIS 2302), an antisense to ICAM-1, designed to inhibit ICAM-1 expression did not reveal significant effect in Crohn's disease. However, topical enemas for ulcerative colitis demonstrated some effect in secondary outcomes, and initial studies in pouchitis are promising (Philpott and Miner 2008). ICAM-1 antibody (UV3) was highly effective at slowing the growth of tumors and/or prolonging survival in SCID mice xenografted with human multiple myeloma, lymphoma, melanoma and other cell lines (Brooks et al. 2008). A structurally diverse collection of small molecule inhibitors has been characterized and developed either to bind the IDAS site of \u03b1L I-domain or to the MIDAS of the \u03b22 I-like domain.",

            "text": "CAMs play important roles in a critical step of tumor metastasis and arrest of tumor cells onto the venous or capillary bed of the target organ. In this process, IL-1\u03b2 induces nuclear translocation of NF-kB in HUVE cells, followed by induction of cell surface expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VAM-1, and subsequent adhesion of those cancer cells expressing sialyl LeX antigen, which is a ligand to E-selectin. The adhesion of tumor cells to IL-1\u03b2-treated HUVE cells can be inhibited by anti-NF-kB reagents such as N-acetyl L-cysteine, aspirin, or pentoxifylline. These observations indicate the involvement of NF-kB in cancer metastasis and the feasibility of using anti-NF-kB reagents in preventing metastasis (Tozawa et al. 1995). Incubation of HUVEC with N,N,N-trimethylsphingosine (TMS) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1\u03b2-induced E-selectin expression. Sphingosine or N,N-dimethylsphingosine had no effects on the expression. This inhibitory effect of TMS on IL-1\u03b2-dependent endothelial cell activation may partly explain the known anti-inflammatory or anti-metastatic effect of TMS in vivo (Masamune et al. 1995). Cimetidine inhibits the expression of E-selectin on vascular endothelial cells in gastric- and colorectal cancer patients, treated for chemotherapy (Kawase et al. 2005). Since the expression of E-selectin and Mac-1 is regulated either directly or indirectly by NF-kB, studies provide in vivo evidence that tepoxalin is a potent inhibitor of NF-kB mediated events in animal models and this novel molecular mechanism clearly defines it as a new class of anti-inflammatory compounds. E-selectin transcription requires binding of transcription factors, NF-kB, ATF-2, and HMG-I(Y). HUVE cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 showed E-selectin surface expression, which peaked at 4 h and then declined. However, ATF-2 binding was unchanged after stimulation with TNF-\u03b1. The termination of E-selectin expression is controlled at the level of transcription, with loss of protein-DNA interactions at only one of three NF-kB-binding sites in the E-selectin promoter (Boyle et al. 1999).",

Andrographolide attenuated OVA-induced lung tissue eosinophilia and airway mucus production, mRNA expression of E-selectin, and inducible NOS in lung tissues.

While TGF-\u03b2 had no effect on the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, the effect was additive with IL-4 in inhibiting the expression of E-selectin. Thus, perivascular TGF-\u03b2 appears to act as an inhibitor of inflammatory responses involving neutrophils and a subset of lymphocytes (Gamble et al. 1993). IFN-\u03b3 down-regulates the induction by a viral mimetic, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly-(I:C)], of E-selectin. The inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b3 on poly(I:C)-induced E-selectin was specific for dsRNA. Results indicated the role for IFN-\u03b3 in the regulation of E-selectin gene expression in response to dsRNA by a transcriptional mechanism independent of NF-kB, as well as by a minor decrease in message stability (Faruqi and DiCorleto 1997).",

Genes that are related to inflammation, cell adhesion and platelet aggregation include E-selectin, ICAM-1, and others (Azzi et al. 2004). Retinoic acid and synthetic derivatives are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects in cutaneous diseases. Pretreatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) specifically prevented TNF\u03b1-induced VCAM-1 expression, but not ICAM-1 and E-selectin induction (Gille et al. 1997). The TNF\u03b1-mediated activation of the human VCAM-1 promoter was also inhibited after t-RA treatment, while the ICAM-1 promoter activation was unaffected, indicating that the selective inhibition of CAM expression is regulated in part at the level of gene transcription. Furthermore, the transcriptional inhibition by t-RA appears to be mediated by its effects upon the activation of NF-kB-dependent complex formation. The specific inhibition of cytokine-mediated VCAM-1 gene expression in vitro provides a potential basis by which retinoids exert their biological effects at sites of inflammation in vivo (Gille et al. 1997). Radiation-induced expression of E-selectin was also blocked by t-RA, whereas 9-cis retinoic acid was ineffective. Application of statins and t-RA might have clinical impact in protecting against E-selectin-promoted metastasis, which might arise as an unwanted side effect from radiation treatment (Holler et al. 2009; Nubel et al. 2004).",

In intestine, MUC2 is the main mucin carrying s-Lex, which interacts with E-selectin. This interaction may contribute to the extravasation of tumor cells and thus to the metastases. In several colorectal carcinoma cell lines the methylation of the 5'-flanking region of MUC2 correlated with the suppression of the MUC2 gene. The increase in MUC2 expression after the inhibition of the methylation with 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine strongly supports the notion that the suppression of MUC2 gene is related to the methylation of the promoter (Riede et al. 1998).",

Additionally, treatment of 2-day iliac thrombi with a recombinant protein, P-selectin inhibitor, significantly improves vein reopening in nonhuman primates (Register 2009). It is interesting to note that P-selectin inhibition decreases thrombosis without adverse anticoagulation. Myers et al.

Since, P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets during thrombosis, targeting the plasminogen activator (PA) to P-selectin would enhance local thrombolysis and reduce bleeding risk.

There are several different types of adhesion molecules with specific functions in the endothelial leukocyte interaction: The selectins tether and trap monocytes and other leukocytes.

Ox-LDL also augments expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF).
