The emergence of the new or newly recognized pathogens, such as the viruses causing novel viral hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, and highly pathogenic modified strains of influenza virus, has altered the entire insight of public health. There is also increasing awareness of the potential for novel or established infections of animals to cross the species barrier and affect man, such as the avian flu and swine flu. Many old infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, have become renascent due to relaxation of control measures as a result of satisfaction, increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents, and social factors that include increased travel, social displacement and poverty [2]. Some long established infections have expanded to previously unaffected regions, for example, West Nile virus in North America. The threat of bioterrorism has raised the spectra of new outbreaks of highly infectious and deadly diseases, such as smallpox, anthrax, prion diseases such as variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (vCJD) and plague. There is now some evidence that global climate change might be contributing to the spread of infectious disease [3]. Unless controlled effectively, emerging infectious diseases will take a heavy toll of human life regardless of age, gender, lifestyle, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status.",

Adjuvants act by a diverse series of pathways that may involve changing the properties of the antigen, providing a slow release antigen depot, targeting innate immune pathways to selectively activate specific pathways of immunity [16\u201320]. In regard to their mechanism of action, the adjuvants can be classified into two groups as follows [15, 21]:Immunostimulants: these act directly on the immune system to increase the response to antigens that stimulate immune responses. Examples include TLR (Toll-like receptor) ligands, MPL\u00ae, cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and Flt-3), saponins, and bacterial exotoxins (CT cholera toxin, LT heat labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli).Vehicles (delivery systems): these present vaccine antigens to the immune system in an optimal manner, including controlled release and depot delivery systems, to increase the specific immune response to the antigen, and can also serve to deliver the immunostimulants. Examples include the following: mineral salts (aluminum) [22]; emulsions (montanide\u00ae) [23], MF59\u2122 [24, 25]; virosomes [26, 27]; liposomes; biodegradable polymeric microparticles; and immune stimulating complexes \u2013 ISCOMs.\n",

Thiomersal (also known as thimerosal; mercurothiolate and sodium 2-ethylmercuriothio-benzoate), which is approximately 50% mercury by weight, is one of the most commonly used preservatives in vaccine formulations. It has also been used during vaccine production both to inactivate certain organisms and toxins and to maintain a sterile production line. Recently, there have been some concerns about the safety of this compound due to its mercury content. Such safety concerns have led to initiatives in some countries to eliminate, reduce, or replace thiomersal in vaccines, both in single dose and multidose presentations. However, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety [30] continues to recommend the use of vaccines containing thiomersal for global immunization programmes because the benefits of using such products far outweigh any theoretical risk of toxicity.",

The \u201ccold chain\u201d system (often 2 to 8\u00b0C) is a means for storing and transporting vaccines in a potent state from the manufacturer to the person being immunized (Fig. 16.2). This approach is very important since all vaccines lose potency over time if exposed to heat and/or when frozen [31]. However, for innovative technology based vaccines, the cold chain system may be very costly due to the requirements for significantly more space in transportation and storage.

Multidose jet injectors were used widely in the 1960s\u20131980s, with billions of immunizations given with these devices. However, concerns about the transmission of blood borne diseases via these devices led to their withdrawal. New generation multidose jet injectors with disposable caps on the nozzle have been developed in an attempt to overcome this risk; however, they were not found to be adequately safe [46]. The older injectors that used the same nozzle on consecutive patients have been superseded by a new generation of disposable cartridge jet injectors (DCJIs), which are currently being used in the USA for needle free immunization in adults and pediatric populations with several vaccines (Fig. 16.3). The devices currently in use are relatively expensive and not suited for use in developing countries; hence, the development of smaller, lighter, and cheaper designs, which could be applicable for both routine and campaign immunization, is required.\n",

Among the various bioadhesive polymers studied for nasal vaccine delivery, chitosan has been shown to exhibit advantages as a vaccine carrier due to its immune stimulating activity and bioadhesive properties that enhance cellular uptake, permeation and antigen protection, as well as being well tolerated by humans [21, 43, 44].",

They mainly function to target associated antigens into antigen presenting cells (APC), including macrophages and dendritic cells, which facilitate the immune response by holding antigens on its surface and presenting them to lymphocytes. Significantly enhanced immune responses have been reported with encapsulation or adsorption of antigens onto particles. Polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, hyaluronic acid, and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are the most commonly investigated polymers for the preparation of particulate systems [58\u201360]. Preparation methods employed to obtain such systems have been reported to be an important parameter for the stability of the antigen. In many cases, an organic solvent and high temperatures are needed for preparation of the particles, which may result in degradation and denaturation of the antigen during processing or after loading [61, 62]. The use of alginates [63, 64] and chitosan offers advantages over other polymers by avoiding use of organic solvents and requiring mild conditions for preparation [43, 52, 65\u201367].",

Plants are used as recombinant biofactories to express a number of vaccines [72]. Plant derived vaccine antigens have been found to be safe and induce a sufficiently high immune response in humans. Hence transgenic plants, including edible plant parts, have been suggested as excellent alternatives for the production of vaccines and economic scaleup through cultivation [73]. Such edible encapsulation protects the antigen through the mucosal and gut systems to allow its uptake. Furthermore, oral plant based vaccines are reported to be stable during storage at ambient temperatures, thereby eliminating the need for a cold chain. In addition, they do not require syringes, needles, or trained personnel for administration [74]. These features also favor use of these vaccines for large scale immunization programmes, particularly in developing countries where resources to provide a cold chain and the equipment and personnel needed for injections are limited. Initially the transgenic fruit or vegetable expressing an antigen from a virus or bacteria as the edible vaccine was intended to be eaten raw without any processing to evoke the protective immune response against a particular disease. However, recently the approach to \u201cedible vaccines\u201d has been replaced by \u201cplant-derived vaccine antigens.\u201d This approach results in the antigen in a pure form and at standardized concentrations [73]. In general plants with high food value are being chosen as expression systems such as apple, banana, tomato, and guava (fruits), peanut, corn, soybean, and chickpea (seeds), cabbage, lettuce, potato, and spinach (vegetables) [73]. Recently, a rice based mucosal vaccine expressing CT-B (MucoRice CT-B) has been reported as a new possible form of oral cholera vaccine [75]. Transgenic rice has been shown to be stable in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract, also eliminating the need for syringe/needle administration as well as the cold chain storage process, and providing physicochemical stability. However, it has been pointed out that a highly sophisticated and a closed soil-less farming facility with artificial sunlight would be required for technical advancement of the rice based transgenic vaccine system.",

Therapeutic vaccines are intended to treat persistent, recurrent, or chronic infections, where drug intervention is either ineffective or suboptimal, and where intracellular pathogens have established mechanisms to escape from the immune system [77]. Unlike the traditional vaccines, which are administered to healthy individuals to prevent infection, therapeutic vaccines are designed to stimulate immune defences in patient populations after they have been infected/colonized with a pathogen, or even after they developed a disease. Therapeutic vaccination is proposed as an satisfactory replacement for, or as an adjunct to, existing therapies [78].",

The side effects of vaccines are often reported; however, considering the fact that a person is at risk from most infections, and that more and more reports are confirming the safety of vaccines, immunization should be considered the first line of defense against infectious diseases. In response to challenges in global immunization, WHO and UNICEF have developed the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS), which covers the period 2006\u20132015 [79]. This strategy aims to assist countries to immunize more people, from infants to seniors, with a greater range of vaccines, and introduce a range of newly available vaccines and technologies to fulfill their main mission of \u201ca world in which all people at risk are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases.\u201d",
