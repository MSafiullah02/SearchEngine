However, in the past we have seen markets recover just as we will see the current markets recover again, so on this basis the recover of the markets will reach a minimum before increasing sometimes in the not-too-distant future. Here we present two forecast models of the S&P500 based on COVID-19 projections of deaths released on 02/04/2020 by the University of Washington and the 2-months consideration since the first confirmed case occured in USA. The decline and recovery in the index is estimated for the following three months. The forecast is a projection of a prediction with uncertainties described by q-gaussian distributions. Our forecast was made on the premise that: (a) The prediction is based on deterministic trend of a data set since the viral spread of COVID-19 started , and (b) The uncertainties are fitted from patterns of the S&P500 for the last 24 years.",

This economic 'wedging' of falling supply and demand is caused by rapidly escalating unemployment decreasing consumer demand where, in the US for example, 17 million Americans have applied for unemployment insurance in the first three weeks of the crisis [9] , and businesses are closing their doors reducing the supply of manufactured goods across the globe [10] . As a consequence financial markets around the world have fallen precipitously and market volatility is at near-alltime highs [11] . For example the S&P500 has registered the worst one-day fall in the last 24 years and the third biggest percentage loss in its history. In this uncertain environment, it is difficult to forecast the fluctuations of the S&P500. We then need assumptions as the mortality rates due to COVID-19 or the duration of the current shutdown of economic activity. Our central assumption is based on a predicted peak for COVID-19 deaths. Current results in Figure 1 based on the daily World Health Organization reports [12] display that S&P500 responds to the inflection points of the cumulative amount of deaths and confirmed cases with no lag. This fact supports our assumption that when a peak number of deaths occurs, the market reaches a critical point.",

To construct the forecast, we assume that the stock market index can be decomposed into a deterministic trend and a stationary stochastic fluctuation. The statistics of the fluctuation have been obtained by analyzing the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P500) stock market index during the 24 year period from January 1996 to March 2020 [15] . I(t 0 ) is the initial point of the stock market index for some time point t 0 , and the index I(t) for t > t 0 is its time evolution.

The crashes in this plot are discontinuous, they occur in a very short period of time and look more like the noise component than the deterministic component. For example, during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) there is a long-term decline in the value of the S&P500 that we can interpret as the deterministic trend, but near the point where Lehman collapses there is a market crash, in fact there are several very large daily price movements that are not always attributable to a specific event.

There are inherent difficult issues to navigate when discussing exactly what is or is not exogenous, but Sept 11 and COVID-19 are unequivocally external to the market. The DotCom collapse is slightly more complicated, relating to the access of investors to equity rather than debt (so there is a bull market in equity prices that slowly collapses into a bear market, but not a leveraged banking crisis, so the collapse is not a spectacular crash like the GFC crisis). Discussing the arguments for or against these details in a paper that do not hinge on the details might be counterproductive.

This impact is simplified as a deterministic response that corresponds to an initiation of a bear market followed by a slow transition to a future bull market. As a simplification, we assume that this transition is dictated by the main quantify of this pandemic which are the peaks on the mortality rate. Our first crude estimation of this deterministic trend (personal communication, April 2,2020) was made to estimate the trend focussed on the time frame of 31/01/20 to 24/03/20 of S&P 500 in which a decline in I(t) was observed. For the construction of trend\u0128(t) two different methods were applied: parabola and hyperbola methods. For the parabola method, three conditions were applied and are illustrated in Figure 3 : The initial point (i) of the predicted trend is\u0128(t = 0), the slope (ii) of\u0128(t) at t = 0 is obtained from a linear fitting of the time frame of 31/01/20 to 24/03/20, the point (iii) where the recovery is predicted at 60 days, satisfies\u0128 (60 days) = 0. For the hyperbola method three similar conditions were applied: The slope of markets recovery (i * ) is assume to be 0.5 of the slope of the markets collapse similar to previous crashes occurred on the past 22-years. The slope (ii) is the same as previous method and point (iii * ) is the intersection of the slopes (i * ) and (ii). For both methods the point (iii) was based on the public information available by the University of Washington where the death rate was estimated to peak on 24/05/2020 (60 days from ii. i*.",

Until this point, we have evaluated the systemic risk as the deterministic aspect of the market evolution, which is often neglected by analysts in the determination of the impact of exogenous factor such as the COVID-19 here. As the next step, we evaluate the risk associated by the stochastic fluctuations of the stock market by \"dressing the deterministic (systematic) risk with a q-gaussian diffusion process. In a previous publication [16] we found that the q-gaussian fluctuations of the stock market index around the trend have distinctive super-diffusion regimes in the spacio-temporal space (there the \"space\" refers to the size of the fluctuation. To allow long-term forecasting on the order of days, we have extended the analysis for longer times. Three well-defined regimes are observed in Fig. 4 ,",

The least square method applies Eq.3 as the fitting function. The second method uses a system of two equations and two variables, q and \u03b1. The first equation is given by the \"second moment\" or variance x 2 . The second equation refers to the \"escort second moment\" or q-variance x 2 q2 [17] , the q-moments are applied to PDFs with asymptotic decays because they provide finite values.

In general, the q-moments are applied on PDFs with asymptotically decays because they provide finite values. The q-moments and the standard moments are equal for q = 1. The solution of the numerator and denominator of Eq. A3 was found by solving first the following integrationDeriving the K(\u03b2, q), the following identity is obtained,Applying the identity solution obtained in Eq. A5 and replacing in Eq. A3. We obtain:The equation system is defined by Eqs.A2 and A6 and is used to calculate \u03b2 and q as a function of time. The \u03b1 and D values are calculated using:We divide the data of S&P500 in overlapping time windows not longer than the transition zones. In each window the exponent of the power law relation is calculated as \u03b1 and then the Eq.A7 is used to calculate D. The results for q,\u03b1 and \u03b2 are shown in Figure A.1 ",
