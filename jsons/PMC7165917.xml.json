IFNAR2 exists as three isoforms transcribed from the same gene by exon skipping, alternative splicing and differential usage of polyadenylation sites.\n8\n The most well\u2010characterized form of IFNAR2, IFNAR2c, exists as a long transmembrane form with a full intracellular domain and is required for a complete type I IFN\u2010induced anti\u2010viral response via the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling cascade.\n9\n IFNAR2 also exists as a short transmembrane form lacking the intracellular domain (IFNAR2b) and a soluble form truncated before the transmembrane region (IFNAR2a), but possessing 11 additional carboxyl\u2010terminal hydrophobic amino acids not found in the extracellular domains of the other two forms. IFNAR2b reportedly acts as a dominant negative regulator of type I IFN activity at least in cell types where it is expressed.\n10\n Studies in our laboratory have shown that the soluble form of IFNAR2 (IFNAR2a) is found circulating in the blood and can exhibit both agonistic and antagonistic properties in certain circumstances.\n11\n Although the complete functionality of soluble IFNAR2 in type I IFN signal transduction requires further elucidation, soluble forms of receptors are clearly essential in other cytokine systems.\n12\n\n",

All IFNs utilize the JAK/STAT pathway for signal transduction\n7\n (see Table 1). Much research has shown that specific combinations of STAT homo\u2010 and heterodimers activate target genes by binding to either interferon response factor 9 (IRF9), which couples the STAT/IRF complex to interferon\u2010stimulated response elements (ISREs) or directly to GAS elements found in the promoter regions of IFN target genes.\n27\n ISRE\u2010binding STAT combinations include STAT1/2 and STAT2/6 heterodimers and STAT2 homodimers; however, IFN\u03b3 has been shown to induce ISRE\u2010binding STAT1 homodimers.\n28\n GAS elements are generally recognized by STAT1, 3, 4, 5 homodimers and STAT1/2 or 1/3 heterodimers.\n27\n Despite co\u2010reliance on the JAK/STAT pathway, the STATs that each of the IFN types activate may be different. For anti\u2010viral activity, the type I IFNs activate primarily STAT\u20101 and \u20102, whereas STAT\u20103, \u20104, \u20105 and \u20106 can also be activated by IFNAR engagement in certain cell types (reviewed by Platanias\n29\n). Although IFN\u03b3 signal transduction predominantly activates STAT1 homodimers, STAT3 homo\u2010 and STAT1\u2013STAT3 heterodimers can also be generated.\n27\n Like the type I IFNs, the type III IFNs activate both STAT1 and STAT2 and can therefore drive the transcription of genes with either ISRE or GAS elements.\n30\n However, in some cell types the type III IFNs can also induce the activation of STAT\u20103, \u20104 and \u20105.\n31\n As the type I and type III IFNs utilize the same JAKs and STATs for signal transduction, it is not surprising that these cytokines have similar biological functions in certain instances. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03bb induce a similar set of genes, albeit that the expression induced by IFN\u03bb was weaker than that of IFN\u03b1 in certain cell types.\n32\n It seems that the importance of type III IFN signaling lies in the narrow range of cells that have the ability to respond to these cytokines (see below).",

Although the defining activity of the IFNs is their ability to invoke an anti\u2010viral response in the host organism, these cytokines are collectively involved in many more immune responses. Of the IFNs, the type I IFNs have the broadest range of biological activities having both protective and counter\u2010protective effects in different immune situations.\n36\n Although type I IFNs are protective in viral infection, IFN\u03b2 signaling causes lethality during certain bacterial infections\n36\n but protection against certain protozoa and fungi.\n37\n\n,\n\n38\n\n,\n\n39\n Although the mechanism of IFN\u03b2 toxicity in sepsis is yet to be fully elucidated, it is apparent that IFN\u03b2 engagement of IFNAR1 during sepsis initiates the transmission of these lethal signals; Tyk2 also has a role.\n40\n\n,\n\n41\n Numerous studies have utilized IFNAR1\u2010null mice or cells, or anti\u2010IFNAR1\u2010neutralizing antibodies to demonstrate the importance of this receptor and type I IFN signal transduction for the maintenance of health and prevention of disease.

In particular, it would seem that the type I and type III IFNs may have some redundancy, as they are both induced by viral infection and utilize identical JAKs and STATs for an effective anti\u2010viral response. However, as the ability of cells to respond to cytokines is absolutely dependent on the presentation of the required receptor components on the cell surface, it is apparent that due to the strictly regulated distribution of IFN receptor components, the different types of IFN have either widespread or cell/tissue\u2010specific functions based on the presentation of their receptors on the surfaces of target cells. The receptors for the type I and II IFNs, and the IL10RB involved in IFN\u03bb signaling are generally widely distributed and found on the surface of most cell types (see Table 2). Two major exceptions to this observation are in regards to the specific absence of IFNGR2 on the surface of Th1 cells\n60\n\n,\n\n61\n and the low expression level of membrane\u2010bound IFNAR2 in sections of the human brain (see Table 2; http://www.brain-map.org). As IFN\u03b3 specifically inhibits the activation of Th2 cells but not Th1 cells, regulation of the surface expression of IFNGR2 in this way restricts responsiveness of Th2 cells to this cytokine.\n62\n As we know that type I IFN (IFN\u03b2) signaling is important in the brain, the low IFNAR2 expression suggests that either this receptor is not necessary for IFN signaling in this organ, that signaling via the complete IFNAR signaling complex is restricted to cells that have membrane\u2010bound IFNAR2 or that soluble IFNAR2 contributes to signaling in this organ.

Due to the role that Tyk2 has in facilitating SOCS1\u2010mediated regulation of IFNAR1 surface levels, and since Tyk2 is part of the type III IFN receptor complex through an interaction with IL10RB, it is possible that SOCS1 also has a role in the regulation of type III receptor surface expression.

            "text": "As with all cytokines and immunomodulatory molecules, the activity of IFNs must be tightly regulated to prevent deleterious effects while still mediating a targeted and efficacious immune response. IFN signal transduction is controlled at many levels, but initially through presentation of the high\u2010 and low\u2010affinity receptors expressed on target cells. The fact that viruses have evolved methods to downregulate IFN signaling, either by reducing IFN receptor expression or through production of IFN receptor mimetics, emphasizes the importance of the receptors as a key regulatory step in transducing IFN responses. As the IFNAR receptors are generally widely expressed, the type I IFNs have a broad range of target cells. This contrasts with the type II and type III IFNs, which show restricted cell\u2010specific activity due to the limited expression of components of their receptors. Regardless of the almost ubiquitous nature of type I IFN signaling, there are isolated examples of differential receptor expression for IFNAR2 with low levels of IFNAR2 message reported in the brain. To understand the implications of this to IFN signal transduction, there is a need for detailed studies of the relative levels of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 protein expression in particular cell types/organs and during different cellular processes. Furthermore, even though the effects of most IFNs have been shown to be protective, IFN\u03b2 is the exception showing lethality in some models of bacterial infection but protection against viruses and autoimmune disease. Perhaps the process by which IFN\u03b2 transduces such contrasting functions involves differential use of the IFNARs in certain circumstances, thus leading to the induction of alternative gene sets. These examples of selective use or targeting of the IFNAR components may herald other as yet unidentified instances of differential IFNAR signaling during the regulation of immune responses by type I IFNs. This is an area that requires further study to fully elucidate the complete spectrum of regulatory constraints on IFN signal transduction.",
