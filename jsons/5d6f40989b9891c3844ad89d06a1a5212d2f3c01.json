            "text": "Two trials separately measured the bioavailability and impact on inflammation of a supplement taken daily containing 510 mg Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 344 mg Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 1000 IU of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D; 25(OH)D), for healthy and Crohn's disease (CD) populations. Both trials were double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled with cross-over. Participants were randomly allocated to groups A (placebo then supplement) or B (supplement then placebo). Both included a washout. Fatty acid (N-3 PUFAs) and vitamin D serum levels, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and stool calprotectin were measured before and after each treatment period. Outcome measures were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models, including terms for treatment, period, and a treatment-by-period interaction. The supplement significantly increased serum levels in healthy and CD groups for EPA (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), Docosapentaenoic acid (p < 0.001 and 0.005), DHA (p < 0.001 and 0.006), the omega-3 index (p < 0.001 and 0.001), and (vitamin D (p < 0.001 and 0.027). CRP and calprotectin measures showed no evidence of a treatment effect on inflammation; however, model estimation was imprecise for both outcomes, hence further research is required to elucidate potential inflammation effects. The nutrient supplement increased serum levels of key N-3 PUFAs and vitamin D in both populations, showing the preparation was readily bioavailable. PUFA have furthermore been identified as precursors of mediators such as Resolvins, Protectins, and Maresins, which stimulate anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mechanisms [15] . In addition, the sum of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membranes and expressed as a percentage of total erythrocyte fatty acids (the omega-3 index), is used as a risk factor measure diseases such as coronary heart disease [16, 17] .",

This supplement, made in New Zealand (NZ) is a new generation, long chain omega-3 PUFA and vitamin D supplement that had been available for 18 months before the first RCT began. The first RCT was conducted to ascertain the supplement's safety, and to measure its effects on bioavailability and inflammation [36] . This was required by the NZ Health and Disability ethics committee before a trial could be undertaken to measure these effects of the supplement in people with CD. In the trial with healthy people, the placebo was an encapsulated medium chain triglyceride (MCT) [37] . MCTs have been long used in clinical nutrition for the dietary management of malabsorption syndromes [38] , and have an appropriate safety profile that has led to extensive use in clinical trials [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . However, an early analysis of the data for the healthy participant trial indicated that the four week washout period was not sufficient, suggesting a carry-over effect of MCT on the vitamin D and fatty acid results [37] . For the CD trial, therefore, each of the intervention and washout periods were extended to six weeks, and the formulation for the placebo was changed from MCT to one containing long chain n-3 PUFA only.",

The study population for each group was recruited from Auckland, New Zealand, with an aim of even gender selection, with ages between 20-65 years. A person independent to the study coded participants names once healthy participants were accepted into the first trial of the first study, and they also randomly allocated them into one of the two arms of the study. In the second trial, CD participants were drawn from the database of an earlier IBD study; therefore their existing codes were used for the CD participants, and they were randomly allocated by a person independent to the study into one of the two arms of the study. All participants and researchers were blinded to the treatment regime until the trial was completed.",

Studies in humans have shown these fatty acids are a component of optimal diets for reducing the risks associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease [4] [5] [6] . N-3 PUFA have also been shown to be beneficial in reducing inflammation, especially in people with inflammatory disorders [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . These fatty acids have been used as dietary supplements for some chronic conditions [1, [12] [13] [14] .

Each outcome was measured from collected samples at each time point (T1-T4). For each trial, a total of 19 fatty acids were measured. For the present study, the n-3 PUFA measurements of interest were EPA (C20:5), Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22.5), DHA (C22:6), and the omega-3 index. These n-3 PUFA were of particular interest as diets enriched in EPA and DHA in animal models have shown positive effects for chronic conditions, and studies have shown cancer and cardiovascular disease were lower in people whose diets had higher levels of these fatty acids [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . There is some evidence that DPA may act as a source for EPA and DHA, hence DPA was also of particular interest [55, 56] . Due to the short time for this trial (four or six weeks in each intervention group), changes in fatty acids would be most notable in serum, rather than in red blood cells, thus serum measures of fatty acids were used instead of the red blood cell measures of fatty acids (which is the preferred measure for the omega-3 index [16] ). For fatty acid measurements, serum aliquots of 500 \u00b5L were stored in Eppendorf tubes at \u221280 \u2022 C for later evaluation using the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by AgResearch Ltd., New Zealand [57] with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [58] . This measure is based on the changes in metabolites produced with the ingestion of the nutrient capsules or the placebo. It is used to determine the extent to which the lipids ingested are utilized. Increasing the intake of lipids does not always equate to utilization and uptake. ",

All models included random effects for individuals, and fixed effects for period, treatment (nutrient supplement vs. placebo), a period by treatment interaction (to account for potential carry-over effects), and a covariate to adjust for the baseline measurements. The use of period-dependent baselines in analysis of cross-over data using random subject effects has been shown to result in biased estimation of treatment effects, and is therefore not recommended [63] . The average of the two baseline measurements for each participant was therefore included in the model as a covariate. Results are presented as estimated marginal treatment and period effects and the interaction (carry-over) effect, with 95% confidence intervals and p-values.

The results of the first trial on healthy people compares favorably with the results of the RCT by Minihane at al. [65] , a prospective study based on the Fish Oil Intervention and Genotype (FINGEN) study designed to investigate the responsiveness of a range of established and putative markers of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to a modest-dose fish-oil intervention on an adult population (n = 312). This trial with each arm of an 8 week duration and a wash-out period of 12 weeks showed that for a fish oil supplement providing 0.7 or 1.8 g EPA + DHA/d and a placebo of 80:20 mixture of palm oil and soybean oil, plasma EPA increased by 1.3% and 2.2% of total fatty acids, respectively, and DHA increased by 1.9% and 2.5% in total fatty acids (all p < 0.001). The authors concluded daily doses of EPA + DHA as low as 0.7 g showed clinically meaningful blood pressure reductions.",

[67] in 2019 showed the beneficial effects of omega-3 for IBD populations. However, a number of limiting factors were highlighted in these reviews: the small numbers in some trials, the cross-over design for trials testing for remission (which was thought to be inappropriate considering the relapsing nature of IBD); the combinations of n-3-PUFA with prebiotics and antioxidants; and the use of placebos such as olive oil which have shown anti-inflammatory properties [66] . Despite these limitations taking EPA, DHA, and DPA in a nutrient supplement is increasingly being prescribed for those with chronic conditions. These fatty acids are now being used in specific dietary supplements in arthritis [1, 14] . EPA is also being used in medical conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia. The USA Federal Drug Agency (FDA) has approved a fish oil capsule (Lovaza) for this purpose [12, 13] . Similarly the REDUCE-IT trial showed the use of Vascepa (icosapent ethyl, (IPE), a high-purity EPA agent) at 2 g twice a day was effective for the reduction of triglycerides in those with known cardiac disease or at high risk of developing it [68] . EpaNova (omega-3 carboxylic acids) is another formulation that the 'STRENGTH' Trial [69] used to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. However, the latter was very recently discontinued as results were showing a lack of benefit to patients [70] .",

Therefore it is important that studies on omega-3 nutrient supplements continue in IBD populations so that the most optimal formulation and effective dose for a supplement containing EPA, DHA, and DPA, and also with additions like vitamin D can be found and for whom it would provide the most benefit. In vitro models have shown that these fatty acids can have an effect on the tight junctions associated with the gut wall. EPA and DHA were shown to change the lipid environment in the membrane micro-domains of tight junctions, preventing occluding (essential for tight junction stability and maintaining barrier function), Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) redistribution, and the distortion of tight junction morphology [71] . These fatty acids also reduced Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induced transepithelial electrical resistance [72] . CD is associated with defects in tight junctions, therefore these fatty acids may help improve the barrier function of people with this disease. In studies with cancer induced cachexia, which is thought to be associated with intestinal permeability and endotoxemia, therapeutic interventions with EPA were associated with improved intestinal function and reduced inflammation [73] .",

This index, instigated by Harris and Von Schacky in 2004 was originally used as a risk factor for coronary heart disease [78] . Since its original conception, it has also been applied to cognitive impairment in the elderly, schizophrenia and depression [79] [80] [81] [82] , cardiovascular disease [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] , and also on cancer. Outcomes of these and other clinical trials have led health authorities to recommend consumption of oily fish at least twice a week [88] [89] [90] . Others recommend daily supplementation for those people with coronary heart disease (1 g) and those with hypertriglyceridemia (4 g) [91] . Despite the number of clinical trials studies reviewing omega-3 fatty acids, not all come to the same conclusion. Studies such as the OPERA study (n = 1516) and the ORIGIN trial (n = 12,536) and another by The Risk and Prevention Study Collaborative Group on cardiac risk factors (n = 12,513), failed to show any benefit [87, 92, 93] . In the review by Mori [94] it was suggested that a number of factors could have contributed to this. Examples of these were: using doses of omega-3 lower than 800-900 mg, the presence of confounding comorbidities, medication interactions, or people already having a high intake of omega-3 through their diet. The confounding factors which may have affected the more recent studies, have in this study, been accounted for in the study design. Moreover, the FAMEs analysis, which detects the extent to which an increase in the fatty acid is taken up and utilized, showed that this indeed occurred significantly for EPA, DPA, and DHA.",

This could be because they live mainly indoors, or at a latitude where sunlight sources of vitamin D are diminished (i.e., not in the ultraviolet (UV) range of 290-313 nm), especially during winter, when they are outside, or due to their use of sun block.

There is also emerging evidence that vitamin D supplementation could diminish the risk of influenza and COVID-19 infections and deaths [104] . Vitamin D supplementation could be particularly important for populations that are immune suppressed, such as those with IBD. A study by Arihiro et al. may endorse this. In their double blind RCT with vitamin D supplementation (500 IU) in patients with CD (n = 55), they found the incidence of upper respiratory infection was lowered in those who had low vitamin D levels (<20 ng/mL) at the start of the trial [105] .",

The normal recommended range for serum vitamin D levels in New Zealand (where the trials were conducted) is 50-150 nmol/L. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as less than or equal to 25 nmol/L. Before the trial with healthy participants began, four (nearly 15%) of the participants were below the recommended range but no participants were deficient; when they entered the nutrient supplement phase of the trial they experienced a rise in their serum vitamin D levels with only one participant not reaching the recommended level. All the other participants (96.3%) at the end of their exposure to the nutrient supplement were in the recommended range for vitamin D. In comparison, over a quarter of adults who were participants in the New Zealand National Nutrition Survey 2008-2009 (N = 4721, aged 15 years and over) had serum levels of vitamin D below the recommended range. The report on this survey noted that the deficiency started to rise in the month of March and peaked in the winter months of August, September, and October [106] .",

Four participants were below the recommended level before starting the control capsule, but after four weeks of having the MCT capsule, nine were still under the recommended level. Genetic variance may have been an influence, and this would need to be explored with further analysis. There was also a decrease in sunlight time; by the end of the control period sunlight exposure was less. However, the intake of MCT may have contributed to the decrease in vitamin D levels. MCTs have a reduced chain length, which means that they are more rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the body. MCTs also have about ten percent less energy than long chain triglycerides (LCTs). MCTs are ketogenic and, for this reason, have been used as the basis of a ketogenic diet [107, 108] .",

When participants began the phase of the trial where they received the nutrient supplement, two people were deficient (with 39 nmol/L and 46 nmol/L respectively) but both moved into the recommended range after six weeks of nutrient supplementation. In the control group, all participants started in the recommended range but two dropped below the recommended range by the end of six weeks exposure to the refined fish oil (33 nmol/L and 49 nmol/L respectively. This suggests that the nutrient supplement was able to maintain the recommended levels of vitamin D even though sunshine hours were decreasing. Of note, the group of participants with CD began with higher average levels of vitamin D (83.3 nmol/L) than the group of healthy participants who began with an average of 66.35 nmol/L, even though both groups began their trials at the same time of the year. That there was a significant carry-over effect present in the vitamin D analysis for the CD trial (p = 0.01) and borderline carry-over effect in the healthy trial (although this did not reach statistical significance, p = 0.06) would suggest that the washout period was not long enough in second trial with CD participants even though the washout period was extended from four to six weeks. The half-life of vitamin D is 15 days [96, 114] .",

In the healthy group, the median ages were 48.2 and 50.9 years for the initial intervention and control group respectively, and of the CD group were 49 and 46.5 years respectively. As people age, their ability to metabolize vitamin D from sunlight decreases. Aging has been reported to decrease the capacity of the skin to produce pre-vitamin D 3 by greater than two-fold [115, 116] . Skin color also affects the ability of the skin to absorb vitamin D. In the healthy group, three people described their ethic group as Chinese, European Zimbabwean, or NZ M\u0101ori European, respectively. These participants may have had more melanin pigmentation in their skin, which would decrease their capacity to absorb vitamin D from sunlight. There may also have been genetic variant differences with respect to the genes involved in vitamin D metabolism in the healthy group. This would have lowered the absorption of vitamin D and decreased their measured vitamin D levels [117] . From the results of the trial with CD participants, it appears that in this sample of people with CD, while on the nutrient supplement, their vitamin D levels were well within the recommended range.",

For both trials, CPR < 0.5 mg/L was considered to be in the healthy range. The high-sensitivity (hs) CRP test, which is often used to check for risk of heart disease, was not used in these two trials. No formal analyses for CRP were presented here due to issues with model convergence and low statistical power. However, from the summaries of CRP measurements across the time points in the two trials, it appeared that the nutrient supplement did not have any clear effects with respect to inflammation as measured by CRP. The majority of people in both trials had CRP levels that indicated they were in a non-inflammatory state.",

In this study, comparisons of the two participant groups at baseline showed that levels of calprotectin were higher on average in CD participants (Table 2 ). In the CD group, fifty percent of the participants had calprotectin scores in the normal or clinically inactive range. Scores for calprotectin are: normal, <100 \u00b5g/g; clinically inactive, <150 \u00b5g/g; mild, 150-219 \u00b5g/g; moderate, 220-450 \u00b5g/g; and severe, >450 \u00b5g/g [120] . The other participants fluctuated in their scores through the trial. This reflects the cycle of inflammation that people with CD can experience. Only one participant consistently rose from the normal range at the start of the trial to the severe range by the end of the trial. It was observed that for this participant their quality of life (QoL) score for the numeric scale (from 1-10) was seven at both the start and the finish of the trial. However, for their IBD QoL score (also out of 10), the average for the ten questions decreased from six at the start, to 4.7 at the finish, which parallels their calprotectin score [121] . A longer trial, with more participants would indicate whether this was a result of a CD flare or a reaction to the supplement and/or control.",

This approach allows the comparison of treatments applied to the same participant, which is considered more accurate than a comparison between different participants. In addition, a cross-over trial requires fewer participants than a regular trial to achieve the same statistical power. Another strength of the trials is that the uptake of fatty acids was measured specifically by the FAMEs analysis. Many trials do not measure the uptake of fatty acids in their interventions. An additional strength of the trials is that although the dose of vitamin D used was only 1000 IU/day, there was a significant treatment effect for vitamin D, with increases for the nutrient supplement compared to the placebo in both trials. A limitation of the trials is that the participant numbers were small in number (27 completed in the healthy participant trial and 24 completed in the CD participant trial). This means the power to test for carry-over effects was limited, therefore the interpretation of the difference between treatment effects is dependent on a subjective assessment of the reality or not of equal carry-over effects. Another limitation is that the carry-over effects for vitamin D in the CD trial suggest that the washout period could have been longer. Another limitation is using changes in fatty acids in serum rather than in red blood cells for the omega-3 index. The daily dose of vitamin D in the trial was 1000 IU, which is lower than the dose of 2000 IU D used in the VITAL trial.",

There was also a significant period effect for vitamin D, with lower values recorded in second time period of both trials, which suggest the lack of UV exposure as at this time it was approaching winter. Based on the results from the two trials, no strong conclusions can be made on the supplements effect on inflammation. There was insufficient statistical power due to the relatively low levels of CRP for most of the recorded measurements in both study populations. Further research is needed to clarify this. From these trials we can conclude that the supplement was successful in increasing the serum fatty acids EPA, DPA, DHA, and vitamin D serum levels, and to achieve this, the preparation had to be bioavailable. The results demonstrated that this happened within a short time frame. Clinical outcomes from the trials will be reported at a later stage.
