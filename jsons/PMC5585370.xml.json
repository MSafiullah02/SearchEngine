            "text": "Type III interferons (IFNs) or IFN-\u03bbs (or IFNLs) are known to play critical roles in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections. Several recent reports have implicated IFN-\u03bbs as the \u2018guardians\u2019 of the epithelial barrier surfaces that encompass large regions of the human body that include respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the IFNL locus on human chromosome 19 were discovered a few years ago to be associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections2\u20134. These SNPs, discovered initially by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be associated with treatment-induced clearance of HCV, got widely validated and were subsequently found to be associated with different human diseases, both viral and non-viral in origin (reviewed in 5). The immunomodulatory role of IFN-\u03bbs is thought to be the molecular mechanism behind these associations5. Among the different SNPs at the IFNL locus, that are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) in most populations, a dinucleotide polymorphism rs368234815 (TT/\u0394G) has emerged as the \u2018causal\u2019 variant5, 6. The \u0394G allele of the variant causes a shift in the open reading frame of the IFNL4 gene, giving rise to a new IFN-\u03bb called IFN-\u03bb46. IFN-\u03bb4 has undergone purifying selection during human evolution with highest frequency of the functional IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G allele in the African population (0.78) and lowest in the East Asian population (0.06)6, 7; 50-60% of the European population carries at least one copy of the functional gene8. IFN-\u03bb4 is a potent antiviral cytokine with structural and functional similarity to IFN-\u03bb1, 2 and 38, 9. The latter are known to modulate adaptive immunity favoring a Th1 predominant response10\u201312. Even though there is no direct evidence yet, IFN-\u03bb4 is also expected to participate in shaping and maintaining innate and adaptive immune responses at the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract owing to its similarities with other IFN-\u03bbs. The interactions of IFN-\u03bbs with the newly discovered innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)13 are likely to hold the key to improving our understanding of diseases like allergy and asthma5.",

Both controls and cases were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P > 0.05) either individually or as a combined group. In the combined group analysis there was no association of the polymorphism with asthma or atopy under either dominant or recessive models of inheritance (Table 2). However, by using log-linear regression we observed statistically significant interactions between the polymorphism, atopy, age and gender (interactions up to three factors; polymorphism, age and gender p = 0.037; polymorphism, gender and atopy p = 0.035). To dissect these interactions further, we stratified our atopy data into several groups based on age and gender (Table 3) and applied bonferroni correction to avoid false positives arising due to multiple testing. Since our study group had a majority of women (Table 1), we chose 50 years as a divider of age in the combined cohort for our stratified analysis as it is also the age of attainment of menopause16 (overall median age at natural menopause in Poland is 51.25 years17,). Only among the >50 yr sub-group of women (older women) we saw a significant association of the polymorphism with atopy after multiple testing correction under a dominant model of inheritance for the minor allele. The \u0394G allele conferred protection from allergic sensitization in older asthmatic women. The significance of association was retained in both the asthmatic older women and in the combined group of asthmatic and control older women, but not in the control older women\u2019s sub-group when tested alone, in both univariate and multivariate analysis (Table 4).\n\n\n",

Even though, the Polish cohort tested for rs368234815 and the other cohorts for rs12979860 the data could be compared since a strong LD (r2 = 0.98) between them in the European population has been recorded6; furthermore, the MAFs in the cohorts were similar (Table 5).

We saw a significant association between the polymorphism and positive bronchial reversibility (or bronchodilator response, BDR) test and usage of corticosteroids (CS) for treatment (Table 8). Older women with at least one copy of the IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G allele were less likely to be treated with iCS (inhaled CS) (OR = 0.35) and oCS (oral CS) (OR = 0.16) but were more likely to show a positive BDR (OR = 2.58) by univariate analysis.

The association of the polymorphism in older women was not just with atopy but also translated to association with some important determinants of severity of asthma like BDR and CS usage. Even though we did not carry out multiple testing correction for our association tests with the polymorphism and clinical features of asthma (Table 8) we feel the phenotypes are not independent of the atopic sensitization phenotype that we identified during our initial analysis (Tables 3 and 4), and therefore less likely to be false positives. For example, atopy-related eosinophilic inflammation and increased CS usage frequency among patients may be correlated24; this is apart from the fact that atopy was a confounder with the association involving bronchial reversibility tests (Table 8).

            "text": "It is important to analyze and interpret our results from the Polish study in the context that they were not replicated in other cohorts of the European population. It should be noted that the replication study had several limitations. Firstly, the findings we made in the Polish cohort were from a hospital-based case-control design while all the three replication cohorts (except COPSAC cohort) were population-based (Table 5). Secondly, 72% of the Polish cohort (among the 384 subjects with information on atopy) were asthma cases and specifically the older women\u2019s sub-group in this cohort had substantially more (75%) asthmatics than controls while the replication cohorts had 16% asthmatics among older men and women in GERA cohort (10% in AR-negative controls and 34% in AR-positives; AR-negative controls were 77% and AR -positive were 33% in the cohort); 9.6% and 11.6% of older women had asthma in the Inter99 and Heath2006 cohorts respectively. It is possible that the association with atopy in the Polish cohort had an underlying link with asthma that could not be accounted for in the replication study. In support of this, significance of association decreased when data was adjusted for asthma status in the older women\u2019s sub-group in the Polish study (Table 4). Thirdly, the Polish cohort was enriched with severe asthmatics (22% controlled, 30% partly controlled and 48% uncontrolled according to GINA 2016; up to 65% of patients were in medium or high dose iCS; 60% were on long acting \u03b2-agonists; Table 1) while this information was not available for the replication cohorts. Fourthly, similar methods were not used to test for the phenotypes in all the cohorts (Ex. SPT in the Polish cohort and serum specific IgE in the Danish cohorts to test atopy). While in the discovery cohort that had a hospital-based case-control design, we saw a significant association of the polymorphism with atopy (in an asthma-enriched background) and severe asthma features in older women, in the replication study we tested for association with atopy, allergic rhinitis and presence/absence of asthma in a population-based cohort. These discrepancies in endpoint phenotypes and the intrinsic differences in the composition of the Polish and the replication cohorts may have led to non-replication of the findings.",

It is likely that the functional IFN-\u03bb4-generating dinucleotide variant rs368234815 may associate with a specific endotype of severe asthma in older patients. It is possible that a sustained course of inflammation of the airways that happens in older asthmatics, likely in response to viral infections over a period of time, will lead to an environment conducive for the penetrance of the genetic effect of IFNL variants in asthma. Since the Polish cohort had >60% women asthma patients and was enriched with older women (Table 1) we saw strong association in the older women\u2019s sub-group (Fig. 1 and Table 3). We hypothesize that presence of IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G allele may be beneficial for an elderly female asthma patient by protecting the airways from increased inflammation associated with virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Although, no direct association of the allele with history of asthma exacerbations or hospitalizations was revealed (data not shown), it should be noted that the Polish asthma cohort represented a group of difficult-to-control asthmatics (only 22% had well-controlled disease according to GINA criteria; Table 1). Along these lines, association of the allele with the presence of acute airway reversibility in response to inhaled beta2- agonists may indirectly reflect less severity of the disease and/or lower airway remodeling in those patients that carry an IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G allele. It remains to be established if the effect of the functional IFN-\u03bb4-generating variant on asthma control and severity is also valid in older men. We did see a protective effect of the minor allele rs12979860 (which tags the IFN-\u03bb4-generating allele) against asthma in older men/all men after meta-analysis of data (Figs 2 and 3). However, the significance of association is low given the large sample size tested.",

            "text": "Further, it remains to be verified if rs368234815 is the functional variant behind this association in atopy/asthma or other IFNL SNPs may also contribute to the phenotype by altering the levels of IFN-\u03bb3 expression similar to recent observations in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis25. Future studies aimed at understanding the functional role of IFN-\u03bb4 in regulating inflammation of the airways are required to understand the mechanism behind the association that we identified in the Polish study. Alternately, this finding could be a false positive result, which also has to be confirmed by doing a well-designed replication study first in another Polish cohort and later in other populations. Nevertheless, our comprehensive analysis with sufficiently large sample sizes has established that an important candidate gene locus consisting of the immunomodulatory type III IFNs does not associate with atopy and AR in the general population (Fig. 3A and Table 6). The association could be more subtle and with specific endotypes related to inflammation of the airways in asthma. The protection to asthma seen in men/older men (Figs 2 and 3) is nominal and further studies can aim at validation of this result in more specific endotypes based on severity of asthma. A fully functional IFN-\u03bb4 may be associated with protecting the airways from inflammation in certain endotype(s) of the disease, specifically in older asthmatics. While further studies are needed to understand this association, whether these endotypes are a result of virus-induced stimuli, also remains to be examined. A previous report documented a strong positive association of allergy26, interestingly more pronounced in females than males, with the minor allele of rs12979860 (which is in strong LD with rs3682348156) in a pediatric cohort. Our results from the Polish cohort, in contrast, show that the IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G minor allele may protect older women from atopy rather than contributing to it. The reasons for this paradox remain to be investigated but may likely involve complex epistatic effects mediated by other innate or adaptive immunity genes and age-dependent changes in Th1/Th2 balance during the transition from infancy to adulthood. Interestingly, age and gender are known to interact and influence the association of rs12979860 with another inflammatory condition of Th2-origin, fibrosis, in chronic HCV infections27.",
