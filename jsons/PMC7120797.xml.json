Hemorrhage secondary to trauma accounts for 40 % of trauma fatalities and comprises the leading cause of preventable death in trauma [1]. Research in military and civilian populations regarding DCR has focused on ways to improve survival in patients with severe hemorrhage. It should be mentioned that the majority of trauma patients do not require DCR and that its techniques should be reserved for those who are the most severely injured [2]. For these patients the rapid and effective use of techniques to control bleeding and correction of this hemostatic derangement coined as acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS) is essential. The perpetuating combination of acute coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis seen in exsanguinating trauma patients is a well-recognized term known as lethal triad (Fig. 3.1). In a practical standpoint, the vicious cycle of acidosis/hypothermia/coagulopathy must be aimed as potential lethal cycle and corrected immediately.\n\n",

The higher the vessel pressure, the harder it is for the bleeding to stop, since the fluid essentially \u201cpushes\u201d the clot out and consequently the bleeding resumes. In another words, it is reasonable to think that hypotension facilitates coagulation. Attempts to normalize blood pressure in case of uncontrolled bleeding as in victims of penetrating trauma may result in increased blood loss and worsen outcomes [10]. Another issue with aggressive fluid resuscitation is the potential for hypothermia if fluids that are stored at room temperature are used. If these fluids are not warmed prior to infusion, this can result in a significant drop in core body temperature. As exposed in Fig. 3.1, hypothermia is associated with many problems including bleeding disorder, organ failure, and hypotension and is one of the three components in the \u201clethal triad,\u201d condition that must be feared and soon corrected by all trauma specialists [5\u20138].",

A commonly used definition in the trauma literature is >10 units RBCs in 24 h. Both of these definitions are reasonable for publications, but are not practical in an ongoing resuscitation. Other definitions are loss of 0.5 blood volume within 3 h, use of 50 units of blood components in 24 h, and use of 6 units RBCs in 12 h. From a practical standpoint, requirement for >4 RBC units in 1 h with ongoing need for transfusion or blood loss >150 ml/min with hemodynamic instability and need for transfusion are reasonable definitions in the setting of a MTP situation.",

The rationale behind early and sustained administration of FFP involves the replacement of fibrinogen and clotting factors [15]. In mathematical studies, Hirshberg et al. noted that resuscitation with more than 5 units of PRBCs will lead to a dilutional coagulopathy and that the ideal manner to correct for this coagulopathy would be to add FFP to PRBC in a 2:3 FFP:PRBC ratio [16]. Another study by Ho et al. noted that once excessive deficiency of factors has developed, 1\u20131.5 units of FFP must be given for every unit of PRBCs transfused [17].",

A quantitative and qualitative platelet dysfunction has been shown to play a role as well in the mechanism of coagulation [18]. Although not as extensively as FFP, platelet replacement as a part of transfusion protocols has been studied to determine the most effective ratio of platelets to PRBC. Hirshberg et al. suggest a ratio of platelet:PRBC of 8:10 is effective in preventing dilution of platelets below the hemostatic threshold [16]. It should be noted, however, that both studies were theoretical models and did not take into account factors such as hypothermia, acidosis, thrombocytopenia, or ACoTS. These mathematical models for FFP and platelets set forth by Hirschberg and Ho have helped modify ratios used for MTPs throughout the world [13, 19].",

The activation of platelets at the site of injury is the reason for a localized action of rFVIIa, as it causes clotting at the site of bleeding. The dose ranges from 60 to 200 g/kg; however, prospective randomized controlled clinical trials using different doses of rFVIIa are needed to explore the potential efficacy of lower doses in traumatic coagulopathy to reduce cost and adverse effects, such as thromboembolic complications [24]. The efficacy and safety of rFVIIa as an adjunct therapy for bleeding control in patients with severe blunt and penetrating trauma were evaluated in a parallel randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial [25]. The authors compared three doses of rFVIIa (doses of 200, 100, and 100 \u03bcg/kg) with three doses of placebo in addition to standard treatment in patients who received 6 units of RBCs within a 4-h period. In blunt trauma (143 patients), RBC transfusion was significantly reduced with rFVIIa compared to placebo, and the need for massive transfusion (defined as 20 units of RBCs) was reduced (14 % vs. 33 %, respectively). In penetrating trauma (134 patients), there was no reduction in mortality and complications or reduction of PRBCs transfused in patients receiving rFVIIa. Adverse effects, including thromboembolic events (a total of 12, six in each group), were distributed equally between the groups. The authors concluded that rFVIIa is safe within the investigated dose and may be a promising adjunct to existing therapy in trauma [25]. The effects of liberally administering rFVIIa in hemorrhaging trauma patients are unknown because its procoagulant effect must be balanced against a real risk of thromboembolic events. At present, the use of rFVIIa in correcting coagulopathy from trauma is off-label and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration [26].",

The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA), a lysine analogue, interferes with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, which is necessary for plasmin activation. Fibrinolysis consists of activated plamin cleaving fibrin. Antifibrinolytic drugs can prevent clot breakdown and thus reduce blood loss in trauma [28, 29]. TXA has recently been shown to reduce deaths in a large population of trauma patients. In 2011, the CRASH-2 investigators published an exploratory analysis of the previous trial that specifically evaluated the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding subdivided by time from treatment to injury. The results showed that earlier treatment with tranexamic acid is more effective in reducing the risk of death due to bleeding. Patients that received tranexamic acid within 1 h of injury had a death rate due to bleeding of 5.3 % versus 7.7 % for placebo (RR 0.79, CI 0.64\u20130.97; p < 0.0001). Similarly, patients that received treatment between 1 and 3 h from injury also had a significantly lower risk of death due to bleeding. However, patients receiving tranexamic acid >3 h from injury had a significantly increased risk of death compared to placebo, 4.4 % versus 3.1 %, respectively (RR 1.44, CI 1.12\u20131.84; p = 0.004) [28].",

When blood is stored, the level of antioxidants decreases, resulting in oxidative damage that converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which cannot bind to oxygen. If blood is stored for more than 7 days, it loses 2,3-DPG. Without 2,3-DPG, the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left and less oxygen moves into the tissues. Storage also promotes hemolysis and acidosis. Researchers have found that transfused blood is an independent predictor of multisystem organ failure and death [14, 19].",

It is now an accepted part of the trauma surgeon\u2019s armamentarium and viewed as a component of damage control resuscitation. The aim of damage control surgery is to stop hemorrhage and minimize contamination. Temporary clamping, packing, shunting, or ligation controls hemorrhage, and hollow viscus injuries are either closed or resected without anastomosis. On completion of the procedure, the abdomen is temporarily closed using an improvised or commercially available topical negative pressure dressing, which saves time, helps to minimize the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension, and facilitates observation of the volume and nature of drainage from the abdomen. Planned reoperation to restore anatomy and achieve definitive repair is carried out on return to normal physiology. Damage control surgery is associated with potential morbidity, should be employed judiciously, and should not be practiced in isolation [2, 6, 30].",
