            "text": "Tea and tea products contain substantial amounts of bioactive flavonoids and have proven to render multiple functional and physiological effects (Cabrera, Artacho, & Gim\u00e9nez, 2006). Many of the health effects related to tea consumption have been attributed to its catechin (simple or condensed) content, which is also responsible for the characteristic colour, flavour and aroma of tea. Among catechins found in tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the predominant one (McKay & Blumberg, 2002) and has been extensively studied as a potential health promoting agent. EGCG has a four ring structure with 8 hydroxyl groups, and is readily dissolved in water while sparingly soluble in hydrophobic media. The hydrophilic nature of EGCG restricts its bioefficiency in lipophilic environments due to limited solubility and hence hindered approach to the sites of action. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of EGCG may account for its poor cellular absorption in vivo and thus low bioavailability when ingested orally. In order to take better advantage of this multifunctional compound, the water-soluble EGCG was structurally modified by esterification with different fatty acids, including stearic (SA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids as described elsewhere (Zhong & Shahidi, 2011). The tetraesters produced showed enhanced lipophilicity and improved radical scavenging capacity compared to EGCG. Lipophilisation of EGCG through esterification may be useful for improving its bioefficiency in lipophilic media or even introducing novel bioactivities due to the fatty acid moieties incorporated, especially when the health beneficial long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are involved. This study was designed to investigate the lipophilised EGCG derivatives as potential alternatives of EGCG for incorporation in foods and as natural health products. Four EGCG-fatty acid esters (Fig. 1\n), namely EGCG-3\u2032,5\u2032,3\u2033,5\u2033-O-tetrastearate (compound 1), EGCG-3\u2032,5\u2032,3\u2033,5\u2033-O-tetraeicosapentaenoate (compound 2), EGCG-3\u2032,5\u2032,3\u2033,5\u2033-O-tetradocosahexaenoate (compound 3), and EGCG-octabutyrate (compound 4) were evaluated for their antioxidant and antiviral activities in vitro.",

            "text": "EGCG is known as a powerful antioxidant which protects against free radical-mediated oxidative changes in both food and living organisms. EGCG acts as a scavenger of many reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) such as superoxide radical anion, peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, among others. These reactive species are implicated in human pathogenesis including inflammation and carcinogenesis. EGCG may trap peroxyl radicals and thus break the chain reaction of free radicals and terminate lipid oxidation. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study on tea catechins indicated that EGCG trapped 6 superoxide anion or hydroxyl radicals, whereas epicatechin (EC) trapped only 2 free radicals (Yang, Sheng, Hou, Zhao, & Xin, 1994). EGCG can also inhibit oxidation by chelating metal ions, such as those of iron and copper, which are catalysts in free radical generation. Antioxidant activity of EGCG depends on many factors, including reducing potential, chelating behaviour, pH, solubility characteristics, bioavailability, and stability in the environment (Luczaj & Skrzydlewska, 2005), which are in turn determined by the structural features of the molecule. Thus, the effect of structure modification on antioxidant activity of EGCG was investigated in this work.",

EGCG has been shown to inhibit the maturation, replication, infectivity and function of numerous viruses, including adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, rotavirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), enterovirus (EV, e.g. coxsackievirus, poliovirus, hepatitis A virus), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Clark et al., 1998, Friedman, 2007, Ho et al., 2009, Nance et al., 2009, Weber et al., 2003), among others, via multiple mechanisms. Antiviral activities of EGCG are thought to be attributed to its ability to act as an antioxidant, to inhibit enzymes, to suppress viral RNA synthesis, to disrupt cell membranes, to bind to virulent proteins, thus preventing their penetration into the receptor cells, and to trigger the host cell self-defense mechanisms (Friedman, 2007). In this study, the antiviral potential of EGCG and its lipophilic derivatives was evaluated in vitro as inhibitory activity against NS3/4A protease, an important enzyme for the maturation of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and \u03b1-glucosidase, the enzyme essential for HIV infectivity.",

The decreased number of hydroxyl groups in EGCG derivatives did not appear to negatively affect the antioxidant activity of the test compounds. Wright, Johnson, and Dilabio (2001) stated that the number of hydroxyl groups in EGCG is largely irrelevant to its antioxidant activity, and it is the strategic placing of such groups that does matter. The substituents on the phenyl ring play an essential role in the efficacy of phenolic antioxidant via both electronic and steric effects. Electron donating groups at the ortho and para positions are able to lower the activation energy for hydrogen abstraction and thus enhancing the hydrogen donating ability of the antioxidant (Singh, O\u2019Malley, & Popelier, 2005). In the EGCG derivatives, the O-acylation replaced the strong electron donating hydroxyl group (a combination of inductive and resonance effects) with a weaker electron donating ester group, which would presumably lead to compromised hydrogen donating ability of the molecule. However, the substitution also hinders the formation of the moderately strong hydrogen bonding of the adjacent hydroxyl groups in the EGCG molecule. These intramolecular hydrogen bonds contribute to the stabilisation of the molecule and increased bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the O\u2013H bond, i.e. resistance of the hydrogen atom to dissociation (Wright et al., 2001). Ortho-substitution of EGCG might result in enhanced hydrogen atom donating capacity by reducing intramolecular hydrogen bonds and BDE.",

The antioxidant radical formed is then stabilised by electron delocalisation (resonance), as in hydrogen atom donation mechanism. Although the net result of electron transfer is the same as the hydrogen atom transfer route, the ability of an antioxidant to donate an electron or a hydrogen atom may vary depending on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

The results showed that both EGCG and its derivatives (compounds 1\u20133) exhibited 2\u201313 folds greater reducing power than ascorbic acid (Fig. 3\n). EGCG had the highest reducing power among all. Acylation with long chain fatty acids led to a dramatic decrease of reducing power, as found for compounds 1\u20133. This is not in agreement with the free radical scavenging capacity of the tested compounds (Fig. 2). The poor correlation observed may arise from different mechanisms as well as the reaction environments involved in the two assays. As already mentioned, the electron donating ability of antioxidants is dependent on their IP, which may be altered by structure modification. Substituents on the phenyl ring may change not only the BDE, but also the IP. The presence of electron-donating substituent groups can stabilise the phenoxyl radical cation and hence lowering the IP and enhancing the electron donating capability. Therefore, replacement of the strong electron-donating hydroxyl group with a weaker ester group results in increased IP and decreased reducing power of the antioxidant. As observed in this case, acylated EGCG showed lower reducing power than the original molecule. The opposite trend was observed for ORAC, although phenyl substitution influences the O\u2013H BDE in a similar manner, possibly because the electronic effect of the substituents on hydrogen atom donation was counteracted by other factors, such as hydrogen bonding and steric changes. Moreover, the BDE of a phenolic antioxidant seems to be less sensitive to substitution than the IP. For example, BDE decreases by 1 kcal/mol, while IP decreases by over 8 kcal/mol, when an aminophenol is methylated (Wright et al., 2001).",

Iron or copper-induced LDL cholesterol oxidation has been implicated in atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Metal chelators such as many polyphenols can bind to metal ions and form a stable complex with reduced redox potential, thus suppressing the pro-oxidant effect of metal ions.

Glycosylation of the viral envelope glycoproteins is essential for infectivity of HIV, and inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase provides a promising strategy for developing novel anti-HIV drugs. Moreover, inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase may also have a therapeutic effect against type II diabetes by interfering with digestion of carbohydrates and delaying glucose absorption.",

            "text": "Catechin and its planar analogues have been investigated for \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (Hakamata et al., 2006). Only a weak inhibitory effect (IC50 >500 \u03bcM) was found for (+)-catechin, while the lipophilic planar analogues (alkyl chains incorporated in a heterocycle ring) exhibited strong inhibition (IC50\n = 0.7\u201347.5 \u03bcM) against \u03b1-glucosidase. Another study on chlorogenic acid derivatives suggested that hydrophobic interactions were involved in \u03b1-glucosidase binding and inhibiting activity of these compounds (Ma et al., 2008). In this study, the ester derivatives of EGCG were tested for their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity and compared with the parent EGCG molecule and a positive control acarbose, a known \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor used to reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia. Table 2\npresents the IC50 values of all test compounds, among which acarbose was found to be the most potent inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase. EGCG showed the highest IC50 value (>200 \u03bcM) among all tested compounds. The derivatives with enhanced lipophilicity had significantly improved effectiveness in inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase. Compound 1 had the lowest IC50 value, i.e. highest potency as \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor among all derivatives, followed by compound 4. The less lipophilic derivatives, compounds 2 and 3, were less effective. The results suggest that the binding affinity of EGCG and its derivatives to \u03b1-glucosidase may be dependent on a combined factor of hydrophobic interaction and steric features, since compound 1 showed a higher inhibitory activity than compound 4 while being less hydrophobic.",

However, reducing power of the derivatives was lower than EGCG, which may be explained by their poor solubility in the aqueous test medium or formation of micelles. The derivatives also showed excellent antiviral activities in inhibiting HCV protease and \u03b1-glucosidase, which were not significant for EGCG. The steric features and lipophilicity of the derivatives may be responsible for the increased binding affinity to the enzymes, leading to greater inhibition. These results suggest that lipophilic EGCG derivatives may be used as potential functional ingredients of food, cosmetics, drugs and natural health products for health promoting purposes. However, these findings are based on in vitro chemical assays, and more research on their bioactivities in real food and biological systems is needed for better understanding and utilisation of these derivatives as functional compounds.",
