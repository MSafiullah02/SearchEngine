PRRS virus (PRRSV, a member of the Arteriviridae; Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) can cause infertility in sows of any age or parity, and abortion at any stage of gestation (Done et al., 1996; Mengeling et al., 1996; Zimmerman et al., 1997). The respiratory form of the infection can affect animals of any age, with clinical signs ranging from mild to severe interstitial pneumonia (often compounded by secondary viral and bacterial infections; Done et al., 1996; Van Reeth, 1997). PRRS can be subclinical, or can be associated with high mortality even in immunologically mature adults (Mengeling et al., 1998).",

Genetic differences have been documented between PRRSV isolates of different virulence (Meng et al., 1995). Intrinsic differences among viral isolates may therefore account for the observed variability in PRRS clinical severity (Halbur et al., 1996; Mengeling et al., 1998). Alternatively, herd characteristics may play a primary role. Conditions which predispose animals to infection via direct contact (e.g. overcrowding) may facilitate the spread of PRRSV within herds (Albina, 1997; Zimmerman et al., 1997). The secondary pathogens which may interact with PRRS are as varied as the disease itself (e.g. Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus; see Done et al., 1996; Van Reeth, 1997); the pathogen load on the farm may therefore affect the manner in which PRRS manifests itself clinically.",

This study takes a complimentary epidemiologic approach, making use of a large collection of PRRSV field isolates and associated clinical data from natural outbreaks. Specifically, this study identifies statistical associations between genetics, farm characteristics, and clinical disease. In doing so, it tests the following two hypotheses (which are not mutually exclusive): (a) that PRRS clinical variability results from genetic variability among viral isolates; and (b) that PRRS clinical variability results from variability in the management practices of the farms on which PRRSV is found.",

The strength of any statistical associations documented herein may therefore be underestimated, due to an anticipated large amount of unmeasured variation. In this light, the primary goal of this study is to document basic associations between genetics, herd characteristics and PRRS clinical severity, in the hopes that future studies may measure such associations with greater precision.",

Epidemiologic data pertaining to each sample were collected through interviews with submitting veterinarians.

Epidemiologic variables collected are described in Table 1\n. Predictor variables (farm characteristics) were chosen either because they were predicted to influence the rate and extent of transmission of PRRSV within herds (CONFINE, HERDSIZE, NURSAIAO, FINAIAO), or because they were predicted to influence the extent and severity of clinical signs once transmission had occurred (VACCINE). Outcome variables were chosen to represent the full spectrum of clinical disease manifestations typical of PRRS outbreaks (Done et al., 1996).",

Genetic methodologies included in vitro propagation of viral isolates followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of ORF5 and automated fluorescent DNA sequencing.
