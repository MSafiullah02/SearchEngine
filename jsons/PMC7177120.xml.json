COVID-19 is a global crisis, so collective efforts are required to deal with this global pandemic. Emotional distress people need to first set the limit of COVID-19 related news consumption from local, national, international, social and digital platform and the sources must be authentic like CDC and WHO. One needs to maintain connectedness and solidarity despite the physical distance.. Individuals with the previous history of suicidal thoughts, panic and stress disorder, low self-esteem and low self-worth, are easily susceptible to catastrophic thinking like suicide in such viral pandemic. Indirect clues need to be noticed with great care, where people often say \u2018I\u2019m tired of life\u2019, \u2018no one loves me\u2019, \u2018leave me alone\u2019 and so on.
