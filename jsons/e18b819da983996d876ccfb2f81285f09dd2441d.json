Coronaviridae are RNA viruses that have been united with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae in the order Nidovirales. The phylogenetic relationship of these morphologically unrelated virus families is based on their similar polycistronic genome organization, common transcriptional and post-translational strategies, and a conserved array of homologous domains in the viral polyproteins [3] [4] [5] . Coronaviruses are responsible for a number of diseases of man and animals, some of which have major economical impacts, although the human coronaviruses have clearly been neglected before SARS emerged. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection is associated with severe and often fatal diarrhoea in young pigs [6, 7] . The human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43 are major causes Coronavirus main proteinase: target for antiviral drug therapy of upper respiratory tract illness in humans, in particular, common cold-like conditions [8] . To date, only the 229E strain of HCoV has been characterized in detail because until the discovery of SARS-CoV, it used to be the only isolate to grow efficiently in cell culture. In contrast to the relatively harmless disease caused by these human coronaviruses, SARS is characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache, non-productive cough, or dyspnea and may progress to generalized, interstitial infiltrates in the lung, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation [9] . The infection, however, is not restricted to the lungs. Other affected organs include the kidneys and the liver, as well as the gastrointestinal tract; hence SARS can be considered a systemic disease. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the transmission of this newly emerging pathogen occurs mainly by face-to-face contact, although other routes of transmission cannot be fully excluded.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 148, "end": 150, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 552, "end": 555, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 556, "end": 559, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 883, "end": 886, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 887, "end": 889, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1594, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses featuring a large (27-31 kB) , single-stranded RNA genome.

Expression of the 3'-proximal portion of the replicase gene requires (-1) ribosomal frameshifting [10] . The functional non-structural proteins are released from the viral polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing. The vast majority of cleavages are mediated by the viral main proteinase, M pro [12] , a cysteine proteinase which is frequently also called 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ) to indicate a similarity of its substrate specificity to that observed for picornavirus 3C proteinases (3C pro ) (see Tab. 1), although the structural similarities between the two families of proteinases are limited [13] . The M pro (3CL pro ) cleaves the polyprotein at no less than 11 conserved sites involving Leu-Gln\u2193 (Ser,Ala,Gly) sequences, a process initiated by the enzyme's own autolytic cleavage from pp1a and pp1ab [14, 15] . Importantly, this cleavage pattern appears to be conserved in the M pro from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as deduced from the genomic sequence [16, 17] and shown experimentally for one cleavage site [18] . The SARS-CoV polyproteins have three non-canonical M pro cleavage sites with Phe, Met or Val in the P2 position, but the same cleavage sites are unusual in other coronaviruses as well.

This can be seen as an indication for the existence of a classical general base mechanism in the wild-type proteinase, involving the non-ionized Cys145 hydrogen bonded to the uncharged imidazole of His41 in the ground state of the free enzyme [26] . We note that in viral cysteine proteinases, both picornaviral 2A and 3C proteinases as well as coronaviral main proteinases, the S\u03b3 of the active-site cysteine residue is exactly in the plane of the histidine imidazole ring, at a distance of between 3.5 and 4.0 \u00c5, while in the papain-like cysteine proteinases, this is not the case. For hydrogen bonding to occur between the two side chains, but not for ion-pair formation, the sulfur has to be more or less in the plane of the imidazole.

However, when we first determined the structure of the SARS-CoV enzyme by X-ray analysis of crystals grown at pH 6.0 [19] , we were surprised to see that the substrate-binding site of one monomer (denoted \"A\", Fig. 4A ) was in the normal, active conformation described above for the TGEV and HCoV 229E M pro s, whereas the other (\"B\") had adopted a catalytically incompetent form (Fig. 4B ). There were two major conformational changes that led to this inactivation: i) the S1 binding pocket for the glutamine residue at the cleavage site of the substrate had collapsed, and ii) so had the the oxyanion hole (Fig. 4B) . We believe that these changes originate from protonation of HisB163, the con-served residue found at the bottom of the S1 pocket, in monomer B. The pH of crystallization of 6.0 is close to the pK of histidine, explaining why the residue appears to be protonated in monomer \"B\" but not monomer \"A\" of the SARS-CoV M pro dimer. As a consequence of the protonation, the side chain of PheB140, which stacks onto HisB163 as long as the latter is unprotonated, moves away and reorients towards the A3 of the other monomer. In order to neutralize the positive charge of HisB163 in its relatively hydrophobic environment, GluB166 moves into the S1 pocket and forms a very strong salt bridge of 2.43 \u00c5 with HisB163. This leads to breakage of the ion pair between GluB166 and HisB172 as well as of the amino terminus, residue A1, of the other monomer in the dimer. This very amino terminus also interacts with the main chain of residue B140, the phenylalanine that moves away in response to the protonation of HisB163. This interaction, consisting of two hydrogen bonds, between the hydrogen bond with the amino group of A1 and the CO of PheB140 as well as between the CO of A1 and the NH of PheB140, is also lost as part of the conformational rearrangements. As a result, the segment around PheB140 (residues B138 -B143) is no longer fixed. It adopts a different conformation with positional differences from the A chain of up to 5.9 \u00c5 and becomes poorly ordered, although we do see continuous electron density for the main chain and for all side chains except PheB140 (Fig. 4B ). In fact, the entire loop translates towards the active site. Importantly, residue 140 is part of the oxyanion loop, which stabilizes the transition state of the proteolytic reaction by donating hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of Gly143 and Cys145 to the negatively charged oxygen of the tetrahedral intermediate. It is essential that this loop be in the right conformation for the enzyme to exhibit full catalytic activity. However, in the inactive protomer, Gly143 moves by > 3.2 \u00c5 towards the active site and leaves no space for the oxyanion to bind.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 176, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 256, "end": 259, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 472, "end": 479, "text": "Fig. 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 642, "end": 650, "text": "(Fig. 4B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 870, "end": 879, "text": "(Fig. 4B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2450, "text": "(Fig. 4B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "pH-dependent conformational changes of the SARS-CoV M pro"}, {"text": "As mentioned above, the S1 binding site is partly occupied by GluB166 interacting with HisB163.

The other one is interacting with the catalytic HisB41 as in the active protomer. In summary, protomer \"B\" in the dimer is inactive because it cannot stabilize the oxyanion transition state and because it is unable to bind the P1 glutamine residue of the substrate. This agrees with the measured activity of the enzyme as dependent on pH, which displays a bell-shaped curve, with a maximum at pH 7.0 and less than 50% activity both at pH 6.0 and at pH 8.5 (Fig. 5) [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 700, "end": 704, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 691, "end": 699, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "pH-dependent conformational changes of the SARS-CoV M pro"}, {"text": "In a follow-up study, we equilibrated at pH 7.6 and 8.0 crystals of the SARS-CoV M pro that had been grown at pH 6.0, and determined the structures by X-ray analysis [19] . At pH 7.6 ( Fig. 6A) , the S1 binding pocket is 186 Kanchan Anand et al. fully formed in both monomers and Phe140 is interacting with the now unprotonated His163. The oxyanion is correctly shaped. Glu166 forms ion pairs with His172 and the N-terminus of the other monomer in the dimer. At pH 8.0 (Fig. 6B) , another interesting change takes place. The salt bridge between Glu166 and His172 breaks -but not the one between Glu166 and the amino terminus of the other protomer in the dimer -, resulting in Glu166 becoming more mobile and partly filling the S1 pocket, thereby decreasing the activity of the enzyme. This is presumably due to the deprotonation of His172 at the high pH value. The pK value of histidine residues involved in salt bridges has been shown to be around 8.0 to 8.5, fully consistent with our interpretation of the phenomenon. Thus, we propose that the low-pH and high-pH flanks of the bell-shaped pH-activity curve (Fig. 5) are determined by the protonation and deprotonation of His163 and His172, respectively. In this respect, our interpretation differs from that of Lai and coworkers who proposed that deactivation of the enzyme at high pH is due to deprotonation of the active-site cysteine [26] . In our opinion, the latter would only play a role at even higher pH values of > 9. The different protonation states of His163 and His172 and their influence on the conformation of the substrate-binding site were further explored by molecular-dynamics calculations over 10 ns each (Tan et al., in preparation). The results are in full agreement with the interpretation of the crystal structures put forward here. Furthermore, molecular dynamics calculations have the advantage that they can simulate states of the system under investigation that are not easily accessible to experiment.

Furthermore, the fact that the conformation of monomer B flips back to the normal, active one within the same crystal lattice after equilibration of the crystals at higher pH values, proves that crystal packing does not play a role here. The amino terminus of the SARS-CoV M pro plays an important role in our structural model, by interacting with essential residues of the substratebinding site of the other monomer in the dimer. Like a finger, the N-terminus docks into its specific binding site (Fig. 7) and flicks on the enzymatic activity of the other monomer. Hydrogen bonding from the \"N-finger\" to the main chain of Phe140 helps shape the oxyanion loop, and ion-pair formation with Glu166 prevents the latter from blocking the S1 specificity pocket. If a free N-terminus is not available at position 1 of the M pro , such as in the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein or in the presence of an N-terminal histidine tag, the enzymatic activity should be reduced and this has indeed been observed, at least with the MBP fusion protein [13] . In order to further demonstrate the importance of the N terminus, we deleted residues 1 to 5 in the TGEV M pro and indeed found the enzyme to be almost totally inactive [13] . This observation also solves the mystery of the importance of the \"extra\" helical domain III of the main proteinase. Its task is to provide defined interaction points for the N-terminal segment and thereby locating the tip of the N-finger to its specific interaction site with Phe140 and Glu166 of the other monomer. Accordingly, deletion of domain III also results in an inactive enzyme [13] . The enzyme is dimeric because of the essential role played by the N-finger, but the N-terminal segment is not essential for dimerization, as shown recently by Shi et al.

In chymotrypsinogen, on the other hand, the N-terminal extension of the polypeptide chain by 15 residues causes disruption of this ion pair [31] . The Asp194 side chain changes conformation and so does, along with it, Gly193, whose amide forms part of the oxyanion hole. As a consequence, interaction of Gly193, which corresponds to Gly143 of SARS-CoV M pro , with the tetrahedral intermediate is no longer possible. In SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, the polyprotein upstream to the Nterminal autocleavage site of the M pro corresponds to the propeptide in chymotrypsinogen. The role of Asp194 of the latter is taken by Glu166 in SARS-CoV M pro and its proenzyme, and the oxyanion-binding region changes in a similar way.

In the case of mouse hepatitis (corona)virus (MHV) M pro , autocleavage has exclusively been observed in trans [28] . On the other hand, it has been shown for several picornavirus 3C proteinases, e.g. hepatitis A virus 3C pro [32] , that the first step of autocleavage of the enzyme, i.e. processing at the N-terminal cleavage site, occurs in cis, followed by other cleavage reactions in trans. Molecular modeling studies based on the TGEV M pro crystal structure suggested that N-terminal precursor cleavage in cis should be possible, because by introducing a bend around residues 11 to 13, the extended N-terminal chain can be quite easily folded back into the active site of its own molecule, even though the distance between the amino terminus (A1) and CysA145 S\u03b3 is about 34 \u00c5 [13] . On the other hand, bringing the N terminus from the position seen in the crystal structure into the catalytic site of the other molecule in the dimer proves quite difficult, even though the distance is only about 11 \u00c5. Thus, the fact that the M pro s are dimers does not necessarily support cleavage in trans. The SARS-CoV M pro structure rather suggests a different role for the dimerization, the mutual activation of the subunits by transition from the proenzyme conformation to that of the active enzyme, triggered by binding of N-fingers to the activation switch. Clearly, asymmetric dimers consisting of one molecule in the mature conformation and one in the proenzyme conformation, as seen in the SARS-CoV M pro crystal structure at pH 6.0, would be important intermediates in this process. Polyprotein processing in SARS-CoV-infected cells could thus be initiated by the occasional dimerization of two membrane-anchored M pro domains within polyproteins and mutual activation through the N-finger tips, or by the rare event of cis-autocleavage of a single M pro domain which then binds to another one within polyprotein, again activating it through the N-finger. The results are highly active M pro dimers which can then cleave other substrates in trans. Such a mechanism could lead to self-acceleration of M pro autoprocessing, after a slow onset triggered by a rare initial event. This mechanism is consistent with the fact that in cells infected with HCoV 229E or MHV, long-lived cleavage intermediates are usually not observed, but polyprotein is processed with increasing speed, once the first cleavage has occurred [28, 33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 238, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2544, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2548, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Self-activation of the main proteinases"}, {"text": "After dissecting the details of conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV main proteinase, we are now finally in the position to competently discuss the interactions of the enzyme with substrate.

We expected to see one of two possible cases, i.e. either i) the inhibitor would only bind to the protomer in the active conformation (monomer \"A\"), or ii) it would bind to the inactive protomer (monomer \"B\") as well, thereby imposing the active conformation onto the latter by an induced-fit mechanism. Quite unexpectedly, neither assumption turned out to be true. Instead, whereas the inhibitor does bind to both subunits and covalent bonds are being formed between the S\u03b3 of Cys145 and the methylene group of the CMK, the inhibitor exhibits two different modes of binding, each of which is unusual and unexpected (Fig. 3B, C) . Protomer \"B\" remains in the inactive conformation, and the inhibitor does not open the occluded S1 pocket to allow the P1 Gln to enter the specificity site (Fig. 3C) . Instead, the P1 Gln points out of the substrate-binding cleft and towards bulk solvent. On the other hand, P2 Leu and P4 Ser bind to the appropriate specificity pockets that have been observed in the structure of TGEV M pro [13] , whereas P3 Thr is oriented toward bulk solvent.

However, the P2 residue fails to penetrate the S2 subsite and becomes partially solvent-accessible. This non-canonical binding results in a frameshift in subsite interaction: P3 Thr occupies the S2 pocket instead and P5 Asn binds at the S4 subsite. We note that the P2 residue specificity of SARS-CoV M pro is less stringent than that of other CoV M pro s, which, with few exceptions, are restricted to leucine [28] . The unexpected binding mode of the substrate-like inhibitor may well be a consequence of the more relaxed specificity requirements of the SARS-CoV M pro , compared to other coronaviral main proteinases. However, before further conclusions are made, it has to be excluded that the binding mode observed is due to an artefact, perhaps because the sequence of the peptidyl CMK inhibitor had been derived from the TGEV M pro and not the SARS-CoV M pro N-terminal autocleavage site.

However, completely different segments of the polypeptide chain interact with the substrate analogues on the opposite site: residues 188 to 191 of the loop connecting domains II and III in M pro , as opposed to the short \u03b2-strand 126 to 128 in HRV 3C pro . As a result, the architectures of the S2 subsites are entirely different between the two enzymes; hence, the different specificities for the P2 residues of the substrates (Leu versus Phe).

Apart from this difference, the superimposition of the two complexes (Fig. 8) suggested that the side chains of AG7088 binding to subsites S1 (lactone derivative of glutamine) and S4 (5-methyl-isoxazole-3-carbonyl) can be easily accommodated by the coronavirus M pro . Thus, we proposed that AG7088 could serve as a starting point for modifications which should quickly lead to an efficient and bioavailable inhibitor for coronavirus main proteinases.

The binding modes of peptidic inhibitors and substrates have been revealed by the crystal structure of TGEV M pro in complex with a hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone, and, within limitations, of the complex with the SARS-CoV M pro and the same inhibitor. The structure of the SARS-CoV enzyme was determined at three different pH values and revealed a pHdependent activation switch for the M pro . The pH-activity profile of the main proteinase was shown to be governed by the protonation and deprotonation of two histidine residues in the substrate-binding site. The conformational changes observed also suggested a mechanism for the self-activation of the M pro by autocleavage from the viral polyprotein. On the basis of structural comparisons between the TGEV M pro in complex with a hexapeptidyl CMK inhibitor and the HRV 3C proteinase in complex with the vinylogous ethyl ester AG7088, it has been proposed that whereas the latter would not be a good inhibitor of the SARS-CoV M pro , it should be a good starting point for designing such inhibitors.
