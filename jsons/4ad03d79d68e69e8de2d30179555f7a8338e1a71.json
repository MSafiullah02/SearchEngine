However, from the details given in the report, there are doubts that this patient is living with HIV, and additional information would be needed to confirm it. In addition, the antiretroviral drug treatment mentioned is not within the standard guidelines for someone infected with HIV.",

He presented with recurrent fever and dry cough and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia on a chest computed tomography scan.",

There is no information on sexual history, drug use, or blood transfusion, which would assist in evaluating his HIV risk. The authors then mention \"an antigen/antibody combination test on blood gave the HIV-positive result,\" without discussion of why the test was given, nor what the test was, or if it was repeated more than once. There is no mention of an HIV viral load measurement, or any subsequent follow up for confirmation of his HIV diagnosis. They then say the patient was put on \"oral therapy with an anti-HIV drug, lopinavir/ritonavir\" for 12 days. This is not an adequate regimen for someone diagnosed with HIV.",
