            "text": "Peripheral blood eosinophilia is a common finding in cats, occurring in association with immune-mediated disorders, endo-and ectoparasitism, infectious diseases, neoplasia and various other diseases (Table 1) . Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HESs), in contrast, are uncommon in cats and are characterised by peripheral eosinophilia, tissue eosinophilia and associated organ dysfunction. Feline HESs can be classified as idiopathic (Hendrick 1981, McEwen and others1985) , neoplastic (Hendrick 1981, Huibregtse and Turner 1994) or paraneoplastic (Bortnowski and Rosenthal 1992 , Peaston and Griffey 1994 , Howl and Petersen 1995 . Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES) has been described in detail (Hendrick 1981 , McEwen and others 1985 , Scott and others 1985 , Saxon and others 1991 , Muir and others 1993 , Plotnick 1994 , Wilson and others 1996 . Paraneoplastic HES is considered to be a marker for systemic or intestinal mast cell neoplasia (Andrews 1987 , Bortnowski and Rosenthal 1992 , Peaston and Griffey 1994 , Howl and Petersen 1995 . However, while peripheral eosinophilia has been documented in cats with lymphosarcoma (Prasse and others 1987, Center and others 1990) , paraneoplastic HES secondary to feline lymphosarcoma has not been reported.",

Diff Quik (Dade Behring, Switzerland) stained cytological preparations of percutaneous fine-needle aspirates from the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes showed numerous mature eosinophils. There was a temporary response to treatment with glucocorticoids but signs progressed and the cat was euthanased. On histology, there was eosinophilic infiltration and fibroplasia of intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes. Large aggregates of neoplastic round cells in the intestine and lymph nodes were identified as T lymphocytes using immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of intestinal T cell lymphosarcoma was made. This case demonstrates that hypereosinophilic paraneoplastic syndrome may occur in cats with lymphosarcoma. Eosinophil chemotaxis may be a response to the production of interleukin-5 by neoplastic lymphocytes.",

There were islands and cords of large round cells with scant, pale cytoplasm and round, ovoid or slightly indented nuclei with single, prominent nucleoli. Few mitoses were seen. Scattered eosinophils and smaller lymphoid cells were also present. The toluidine blue stain depicted individual, well-granulated, mature mast cells. No metachromatic granular staining was identified in the small lymphoid cells, the large round cells with prominent nucleoli or the mitotic cells (Fig 3B) . There was an irregularly increased lymphoid infiltrate in the lamina propria, with associated villous stunting and crypt distortion.",

The disease has been most commonly reported in FeLV-negative, middle aged, female domestic shorthaired cats (Hendrick 1981 , McEwen and others 1985 , Scott and others 1985 , Saxon and others 1991 , Muir and others 1993 , Plotnick 1994 , Wilson and others 1996 . Presenting signs are often referable to severe eosinophilic enteritis and include weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, haematochezia and intestinal thickening. Abdominal masses, due to eosinophilic infiltration of mesenteric lymph nodes, may also be present. Bone marrow cytology is characterised by hyperplasia of the eosinophil series with orderly eosinopoiesis, distinguishing the disease from eosinophilic leukaemia (Hendrick 1981) . Cats with eosinophilic leukaemia also tend to have a higher myeloid:erythroid ratio, moderate to severe anaemia and a higher percentage of circulating immature eosinophils than those with IHES (Huibregtse and Turner 1994) .a IHES is a diagnosis made after exclusion of known causes of eosinophilia. Eosinophil counts of up to \u202b01\u05df74\u202c 9 /litre have been documented in cases of flea-allergy dermatitis, eosinophilic granuloma complex, feline asthma and endoparasitism (Center and others 1990) . Eosinophilic enteritis may also be considered a hypereosinophilic syndrome, although many cases included in the original description of this disease had eosinophilic infiltration of other organs and could, thus, be classified as IHES (Hendrick 1981 , Moore 1983 . Proposed mechanisms for IHES in cats include immunoregulatory dysfunction or an intrinsic, probably preneoplastic, bonemarrow disorder (Hendrick 1981 , McEwen and others 1985 , Center and others 1990 . Treatment of affected cats with prednisolone, at doses ranging from 2 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, has resulted in short-lived responses of weeks only and the overall prognosis is poor (Saxon and others 1991 , Plotnick 1994 , Wilson and others 1996 . Combination therapy with prednisolone and hydroxyurea warrants further investigation, with long term responses reported in one cat (Muir and others 1993) and in a dog with IHES (Perkins and Watson 2001) of 28 months and 16 months, respectively.a",

Overproduction of IL-5 by the expanded clone is thought to result in eosinophil chemotaxis and, ultimately, HES (Cogan and others 1994, Brugnoni and others 1996) . Given the propensity of cats to develop lymphoproliferative diseases, a similar mechanism may be operating in a subset of feline IHES cases. Furthermore, similarities in eosinophil responses in cats and humans have been demonstrated. For instance, T cell-mediated IL-5 eosinophil chemotaxis in feline asthma is analogous to that in human asthma (Padrid 2000) .",

In a subset of Hodgkin's disease patients, peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia occurs in over 80 per cent of cases (Samoszuk 1997) . In contrast, hypereosinophilia is rarely associated with lymphoma of B cell lineage (Navarro-Roman and others 1994). In lymphomas of both lineages the mechanism of eosinophil chemotaxis is thought to be due to the elaboration of IL-5 by neoplastic lymphocytes (Samoszuk 1997) . Furthermore, neoplastic B cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma may produce the cytokines tumour necrosis factors alpha (TNF?) and IL-13, thereby inducing the production of eotaxin by fibroblasts (Poppema and van den Berg 2000) . Eotaxin, an eosinophil chemotactic chemokine, is, like IL-5, a potent attractant of eosinophils. Hypereosinophilic paraneoplastic syndromes have also been reported in horses and ferrets with T cell lymphosarcoma (La Perle and others 1998, Blomme and others 1999) .",
