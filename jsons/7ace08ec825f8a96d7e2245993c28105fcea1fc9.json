We extend the SIR epidemiological model to include endogenous meeting rates. Individuals benefit from economic activity, but higher activity also leads to more interactions with potentially infected individuals. The main focus is a theoretical analysis of the contagion dynamics. In the leading case, the infection prevalence is single-peaked. We obtain a simple condition for when several types of public-health interventions or changes in disease prevalence will paradoxically increase infection rates due to risk compensation. This condition implies that public-health interventions are most likely to be undermined by increased economic activity near the peak of severe diseases. * Harvard University.",

            "text": "In severe epidemics such as COVID-19, the spread of contagious diseases depends substantially on behavioral and policy responses. Standard epidemiological models predict diseases paths under several assumptions on social distancing, and outcomes usually differ dramatically across these scenarios. 1 Given the very large impact of mitigation measures such as social distancing on infection dynamics, understanding how much people will interact is an important open question (Funk et al., 2015) . This paper studies the spread of a disease and the resulting behavioral responses analytically. To analyze the spread of a diseases and the accompanying behavioral responses, we adapt the widely-used SIR epidemiological model to allow individuals to choose activity levels at each point in time. Higher activity levels correspond to actions such as going to work or school which provide economic and social benefits. On the other hand, higher activity also leads to more interactions with potentially infected individuals, especially when the disease prevalence is high and whether others are more active (e.g., public spaces are crowded). Given the shares of the population that are susceptible and infected at a given time, individuals' choices are determined by a simple game-theoretic framework.",

The logic is that individuals respond to a decrease in risk by increasing activities levels, and this can increase the infection rate under equilibrium behavior. A dynamic model lets us determine whether and when in the course of a disease this may be the case. We identify a region, which has a simple characterization in terms of model parameters, in which behavioral responses to various changes in policies or disease levels are sufficiently strong to produce such paradoxical effects. This region requires a severe disease and a high prevalence. So near the peak of a severe outbreak, public-health interventions can be less effective or even counterproductive unless paired with attempts to maintain social distancing. When prevalence is lower, changes such as requiring masks are quite effective.",

The intuition is that in this case, most individuals who have not yet recovered are unlikely to be susceptible. Shifting some individuals from susceptible to infected would further decrease the chance of being susceptible. This mitigates infection risk and leads to more interaction (see Section 4 for similar effects). The proof gives a necessary condition for this to increase disease prevalence, which requires I(t) > S(t) but is actually substantially stronger.

Define an infection chain i 0 , . . . , i k of length k to be a sequence of k individuals such that i 0 is infected at time zero and for each 0 \u2264 j < k, individual i j meets individual i j+1 while individual i j is infected. Then R(\u221e) is equal to the share of agents who are in an infection chain of length k for any k. So it is sufficient to show that the number of individuals in infection chain of length k for any k is weakly higher under level of activity q at all times compared to q(t).",

By the inductive hypothesis, there are weakly more individuals in an infection chain of length at most k under actions q at all times compared to q(t). As meetings are independent, the probability of meeting any such individual is increasing in q i (t) and q I (t)",
