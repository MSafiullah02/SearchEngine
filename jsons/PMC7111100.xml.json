However, traditional culture is slow and less sensitive than detection by newer molecular techniques. Although rapid shell vial culture techniques for CMV improve the timeliness of detection, neither culture method is able to distinguish between viral shedding and true CMV disease. The pp65 antigenemia assay detects the late structural protein pp65 produced in leukocytes with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%.23, 24 The need for both rapid processing and technical skill in interpretation limit its usefulness. Molecular diagnostic assays that detect and quantify CMV- DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have high sensitivity (95-100%) and are being increasingly recognized as the method of choice for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in CMV disease. Comparative studies between antigenemia detection and PCR have shown a more than 80% concordance.23, 25 Both PCR and pp65 antigenemia can be used for early detection of viral replication according to local experience.",
