In our study, however, we did not observe a significantly lower sensitivity of the Leishmania OligoC-TesT in 13 patients originating from L. (V.) peruviana-endemic regions in southern Peru, because only one of these patients had a negative test result. No cross-reaction with nontarget human pathogens was observed, and all Leishmania species tested had a positive test result. Considering the high similarity of the 18S rRNA gene sequence in Leishmania and Endotrypanum, Crithidia, Wallaceina, and Leptomonas organisms [24], our assay might have positive results with these nonpathogenic lower trypanosomatids. Although the chances of finding such protozoa in immunocompetent patients are negligible, they may show up as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients [25]. If needed, confirmation could be provided by direct sequencing of the PCR product, because Leishmania-specific point mutations are present (authors' unpublished data).",

This finding is similar to the observed sensitivities of other PCR assays reviewed by Vega-L\u00f3pez [8]. Direct microscopy of the lesion showed a lower sensitivity (78.8%). The lack of a positive PCR result in some of the confirmed CL and MCL lesion samples might be explained by (1) heterogeneity in parasite distribution in the lesion, (2) delay between sample collection and testing, or (3) false-positive microscopic results caused by staining artifacts. This is supported by the fact that 3 of the 4 Leishmania OligoC-TesT negative samples were also negative in a second PCR analysis performed in Peru targeting the Leishmania kinetoplast DNA [28] (authors' unpublished data). Leishmania DNA could be detected in all lesion scrapings, which is encouraging, because this offers a less invasive sampling procedure compared with biopsy punctures. The higher sensitivity for lesion scrapings can be explained by the lower amount of PCR-inhibiting factors. This is confirmed by the observation of Garcia et al. [29], who reported a higher sensitivity of PCR for lesion scrapings than for biopsy specimens in 44 Bolivian patients with CL or MCL. The similar sensitivities of our method for CL and MCL samples is encouraging, considering the generally low parasite load in the latter.",

Patients with clinically suspected infection who have positive serologic results and positive Leishmania OligoC-TesT results in blood might not need to undergo the invasive bone marrow or spleen sampling. Previous PCR studies found the same range of sensitivity in blood [9, 30]. The lower sensitivity of the test in blood samples from Sudan (77.8%) versus those from Kenya (92%) could be due to bias in parasite load or experimental differences during DNA extraction. Further evaluations with different types of extraction methods might be recommended. Despite the low number of available lymph node samples, the observation that all of them showed positive Leishmania OligoC-TesT results is encouraging. Indeed, if molecular diagnosis in lymph nodes proves to have high sensitivity, this would be a major step forward in the search for a noninvasive method for diagnosing VL. Previous studies showed similar findings in a larger number of lymph node samples [31, 32]. Further studies of molecular diagnosis in the lymph would be interesting, especially for East African VL, for which the majority of patients have enlarged lymph nodes [33].",

The biotinylated capture probes accumulate the hybridized complex on the Neutralite avidin lines on both sides of the strip, resulting in visible red lines (8). For a negative sample, only the IC amplicon is present and is captured on the control side (9). The excess detection probes migrate further and hybridize on the complementary probes coated on both sides of the dipstick as a control for migration (10). The IC line and the migration control lines determine whether the test is valid or invalid. An invisible migration control line indicates an invalid detection step, while an invalid PCR is indicated by a negative IC line in combination with a negative test line. The latter is possibly due to inhibitory factors in the extracted DNA. When a sample contains high concentrations of Leishmania DNA, competition between the Leishmania DNA and the IC template DNA during PCR can result in an invisible IC control line combined with a strongly visible Leishmania test line. In this case, the test is considered valid.",
