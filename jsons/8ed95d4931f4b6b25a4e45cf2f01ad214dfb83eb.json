Providing and maintaining hope for patients with cancer is something that medical and radiation oncologists recognize as important. Medical statistics only describe numbers such as Kaplan-Meier survival curve to be used to measure the fraction of subjects living for a certain amount of time after treatment. Could we divide the curve into sections, from\" defeated\" to \"victory\" to \"pessimistic\" to \"hopeful? Hope can continue even as clinical treatments cease. It is never lost. Life is inherently uncertain and unpredictable, with or without cancer. In the Figure 1 , the fear of the COV\u0130D-19 virus disease is clearly observed. The patient depicts how the patient eventually embraced life for all the distress brought along with fear of COV\u0130D-19 virus. Real blindness was to live in a world where hope was exhausted. Because we know that we will see beautiful days, sunny days. The greatest of the Islamic mystic poets Jalal ad-Din AR-Rumi, better known as Mevlana, said'' After hopelessness there is so much hope after darkness there is much brighter sun''.",
