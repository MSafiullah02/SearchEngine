Patients were excluded for the following reasons: a single dose of a planned course of chemotherapy (1 patient), chemotherapy completed \u03fe1 year before death (3), autopsy performed \u03fe36 hours after death (3), and unavailability of formalin-fixed lung tissue specimens (4) . The number of patients was then reduced to 118 by using a table of random numbers. Of these patients, 54 had leukemia or lymphoma, 46 had carcinoma, and 18 had sarcoma. In the leukemia or lymphoma group, there were 18 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia, 7 of acute lymphocytic leukemia, 7 of lymphocytic lymphoma, and \u03fd4 of any other diagnosis.

Seven percent of our patients had pulmonary infections with common RNA respiratory viruses. However, it should be emphasized that no epidemiological conclusions should be drawn from the present study, because of the small sample size and the occurrence of viral antigen in two of the designated controls. Patients 6 and 8 (myocardial infarctions) acquired influenza virus and RSV infections, respectively, in the community, since they were hospitalized for a shorter time than an incubation period. Most of the infections occurred in the winter and spring, the characteristic seasonality for respiratory viral infections. It seems possible that patients 3 and 4 were infected with influenza A virus from a common source, since they were in the same unit at the same time. The only other autopsy study of pulmonary viral infections in immunosuppressed individuals looked for CMV, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus (but not RNA respiratory viruses) by in situ hybridization and found only CMV [7] .",

            "text": "It is becoming clear that the burden of disease produced by common RNA respiratory viruses is much higher than generally appreciated in the elderly, adults with serious chronic disease, and individuals who have received immunosuppressive therapy [8] . The perceived incidence of disease is quite dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays for infection, and many studies have looked for only one or a few viruses. In a broad prospective study of the elderly living in the community [9] , rhinoviruses were found to be the most important cause of upper respiratory tract infections, followed by coronaviruses and more distantly by influenza viruses, RSV, and parainfluenza viruses. Surprisingly, even rhinovirus and coronavirus infections were associated with lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. We suggest that elderly, chronically ill, or immunosuppressed patients who are febrile and have signs of pulmonary disease be tested for the presence of respiratory viral infection. Rapid diagnostic testing based on immunofluorescence or EIAs for viruses associated with lower respiratory tract infections is sensitive and specific for pediatric patients. However, these methodologies are not sensitive for adult patients, since all such infections represent reinfections and are associated with shorter periods of viral shedding and much lower virus titers [10] . Multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR assays are efficacious for adults and can test for multiple viruses in a single reaction [11] . Whether rapid diagnosis will identify influenza A virus infections early enough to be treated with amantadine or rimantadine remains to be determined, since therapy probably needs to be started within the first 2 or 3 days after infection.",
