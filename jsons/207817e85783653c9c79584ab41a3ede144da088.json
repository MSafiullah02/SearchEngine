Accurate information from reliable sources is essential in fastmoving global health crises such as Covid-19, with misinformation adding to fear and anxiety. Health anxiety is also an influential factor in the success of public health strategies to manage pandemics [2] . We sought to assess maternal anxiety due to Covid-19, adaptations in behaviour, and information sources used by pregnant patients.",

Pregnant women had heightened anxiety regarding their older relatives' health (83.3%,55/66). This was followed by concern about their other children (66.7%, 28/42) and then their unborn baby (63.4%, 45/71).",

One third (32.4%, 23/71) began staying at home from work due to fears regarding the virus while a further one in five patients (19.7%, 14/71) began working from home. Almost half of women questioned (46.5%, 33/71) altered their primary method of transportation. Bulk-buying was reported by many participants (66.2% food, 42.3% Hand sanitizer, 25.4% toiletries, 9.9% fuel, 8.5% protective personal equipment). Following the closure of schools in Ireland just before data collection, 38.2% (26/71) of women needed additional child support. A further 23.9% (17/71) had to stay home to care for existing children, 11.3% (8/71) were relying on When information resources were presented to patients at the conclusion of the survey, 77.5% (55/71) found this information extremely helpful, while 29.6% (31/71) did not know about these information sources prior to our study.",

Women are most concerned about older relatives, then their children, followed by their unborn child. Our patients are least concerned about their own health, but despite this, over half of women have significant health anxiety. Government instruction on social distancing has resulted in major changes in behaviour among pregnant patients. Pregnant women being under additional pressure may have indirect adverse effects on their physical and mental health. It is critical to recognise this and support patients through the provision of accurate and up-todate information, with simple strategies such as in this study leading to improved patient satisfaction and empowerment. Television news bulletins remain the most utilised source of information. Few patients used twitter or other social media as information sources, which is reassuring given the concerns over distribution of misinformation through social media. This data can be used to guide public health strategy regarding patient anxieties, changes in behaviour and health information sources, revealing the highest yield platforms to relay health messages to patients.",
