Many research projects have been driven and improved by moving-object data analysis, such as individual/group behavior analysis, path discovery and behavior prediction. Because of the large amount of moving objects in real applications, these analyses require a powerful GIS data model to store, analyze and interpret physical and contextual information (e.g., absolute topology and relative motion) of moving objects.",

In absolute space, geocoded locations are bound to previously existing geometry and topology relationships among the corresponding points in the space (Meentemeyer, 1989, Couclelis, 1999). Therefore, moving objects are always represented as a series of observations that consist of an id, location and time (Hornsby and Egenhofer, 2002, Spaccapietra et al., 2008), alongside additional information such as activities (Wang and Cheng, 2001, Shaw and Yu, 2009) and semantics (Zhang et al., 2014, Vandecasteele et al., 2014). Furthermore, these models describe their movement processes and interactions alongside basic geographical information (such as land use, POI, and events). In fact, these models require a large amount of computation to support analysis from the perspectives of individual or groups of moving objects (which could be called relative space). Moreover, several analysis, such as the surrounding dynamics and motion trends of nearby crowds, are critical to moving objects in highly complex and dynamic environments according to the personal requirements of decision-making (e.g., on relax life style, feeling of safety). Current GIS data models must be improved in terms of the geo-computation of these analyses.",

Importantly, the analysis of moving objects in relative space could easily follow instinctual requirements. Therefore, the motivation of this paper is to create a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects and propose some basic GIS operators for analyzing moving objects, which changes the analysis of current absolute space-based GIS models and facilitates the efficient computation of real-time relative relationship dynamics, such as the surrounding dynamics and motion trends of crowds near moving objects. The contributions from this paper are summarized as follows:\u2022A relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) is introduced to construct, operate and analyze moving objects\u2019 relative relationships.\u2022A relationship-querying algorithm and relative dynamic pattern-matching algorithm are introduced to analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects.\u2022Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and derivation of the motion trends of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model, which also shows better performance compared to absolute methods.\n",

            "text": "Moving objects are a very popular representation requirement in current GIS applications because of the large volume of their tracked trajectories, e.g., cars in cities, vessels at sea, and even people around the world. Therefore, many research projects have been conducted to store, manage and query moving-object data in the communities of computer science and geographical information science. In computer science, several data structures have been defined to support the storage and querying of moving objects. The first structure is the storage unit in DBMSs (database management systems). G\u00fcting and his group abstracted moving objects into moving points and moving regions and developed a discrete model in a DBMS to store, manage and query moving objects\u2019 data (Forlizzi et al., 2000, G\u00fcting et al., 2000, G\u00fcting et al., 2004, G\u00fcting and Schneider, 2005). Based on abstracted data types, moving objects could be managed and queried by using SQL. These works provided a solid foundation to support research on moving objects. The second is tree structures. Moving objects were usually abstracted as points (Ranu et al., 2015), single continuous polynomials (Ni and Ravishankar, 2007), or non-regulated sequences of roads in transportation networks (Sandu Popa et al., 2011). Then, these objects were indexed by the tree\u2019s derivatives, for example, B + -trees (Sandu Popa et al., 2011), R-trees (Yue et al., 2018), 3D R-trees (Xu et al., 2018), FN (fixed network) R-trees (Zheng et al., 2011), PA-trees (Ni and Ravishankar, 2007), and grid trees (Yan et al., 2015). These tree-based indices could facilitate efficient queries on moving objects. The third structure is moving object-oriented databases. To satisfy the demand of faster processing with big data, PostgreeSQL (Ding et al., 2015), MongoDB (Liu et al., 2013), MonetDB (Boncz et al., 2005), and Cassandra (Hospital et al., 2015) were developed to store and analyze large volumes of moving objects\u2019 information.",

            "text": "In the community of geographical information science, traditional GIS data models, such as field-based models (e.g., raster-based models) (Cova and Goodchild, 2002) and feature models (e.g., object- and vector-based models) (Tang et al., 1996), usually depended on absolute coordinates in their reference frames to describe spatial object\u2019s motion or relationships. These models were often used to represent some key concepts that were related to moving objects, i.e., the place, activity and semantics. The concept of \u201cplace\u201d was used to indicate the location of activity, which usually complied with a certain upper-bound distance and lower-bound duration (Kang et al., 2004). Human daily activities were always represented as a sequence of place visits (Do and Gatica-Perez, 2014). Additionally, space time path was a key concept in classical time geography framework that was used to represent and analyze activities and interactions in a hybrid physical\u2013virtual space (Shaw and Yu, 2009) and social space (Yin and Shaw, 2015). Several basic semantics of moving objects were derived from the trajectories of moving objects, for example, episodes, stops, and moves (Ilarri et al., 2015). Based on these basic semantics, researchers (Parent et al., 2013, Bogorny et al., 2014, Jiang et al., 2015, Wan et al., 2018) built semantic trajectories from semantic point sequences. Semantic trajectories were easy for urban planners and migration or transportation agencies to use to mine spatial-temporal mobility patterns.",

            "text": "Moving object-oriented operators (i.e., range queries, nearest-neighbor queries) were derived to support the analysis of moving objects\u2019 relationships. The first common operator is range queries, which specify a value of moving objects to fall within a lower and upper boundary (Zheng et al., 2011, Zhan et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2018, Yue et al., 2018), e.g., finding all the objects of a specific traveler between 7 am and 9 am. Filtering and refining are two important steps of range queries. Filtering determines candidate locations (such as a node in a tree structure) that contain specified attribute values and overlap the query area in space and time, while refining retrieves well-matched objects under the querying conditions through some advanced filtering techniques, such as statistics-based approaches (Zhan et al., 2015) and time-based partitioning techniques (Yue et al., 2018). The second common operation is nearest-neighbor (NN) queries, which find the nearest neighbors to a given object in a database for a specific time interval. Two similar phases of NN queries include searching for candidate units based on the idea of node pruning with large coverage and determining the well-matched results according to various conditions, such as time limits (G\u00fcting et al., 2010), obstacles (Gao et al., 2011), spatial-network structures (Cheema et al., 2012), reverse nearest neighbors (Cheema et al., 2012) and movement uncertainties (Niedermayer et al., 2013). These operators are usually applied by calculating the distance between the coordinates of moving objects to derive relative metrics such as the distance, direction and time. This situation could produce repeated computations and misrepresent the relative relationships of moving objects without a geocoding technique.",

These studies aim to control the moving object in real time to avoid risk and complete the established movement in the ocean or aerospace, where no appropriate global reference for them. Those studies focus on the real-time motion control to respond to surrounding moving objects in a high dynamic scenario.

For instance, the average distance is calculated through a statistics function, and the unit in the resulting matrix shows the average distance between each pair of objects, which infers the closeness of their relationship during the entire period.(2)\nTarget flattening computes the relative dynamic statistical characteristics of all the target objects relative to each reference object at each time stamp and retrieves a matrix that contains the results. For example, if we want to calculate the interaction frequency, we can obtain a result matrix that indicates the interaction changes of each reference object relative to other objects over time.\n",

The main idea of this algorithm are to organize the relative relationship as three dimensions, namely, Reference object, Target object and Time, which is based on model\u2019s structure, and then to index relative relationship by corresponding objects and time. By using a composite index consisting of Reference object, Target object and Time, this algorithm can quickly find out the relative relationship completely covered by the given restricted objects and time. In the query, this algorithm retrieves relationships by accessing the relative relationship according to the corresponding composite index of given object and time, instead of extracting each relative relationship bins of reference or target object one by one in the cube. Therefore, this algorithm can be integrated with all the operators shown in Section 3.2.1 and constrained by six parameters, namely, Cube, Query_type, C_ref, C_ tar, C_T, and rel, which are explained in Algorithm 1. Cube is a structure of map, whose key consists of a reference and target object, while value is also a map whose key is the time and value is the relationship. The detail of the Query processing algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.When comparing this algorithm with traditional GIS querying in absolute space, this algorithm can avoid many redundant computational address coordinates, which can improve the efficiency of the relative relationship querying. We will test this approach in Section 5.5.",

Given a specific pattern (Pattern_S), each object\u2019s distance to the Pattern_S needs to be calculated to measure its similarity to Pattern_S. Finally, the trajectory, whose distances are all in matching threshold (in Fig. 7), would be got as the outcome of Pattern matching in absolute space. In relative space, dynamic pattern is represented as a relative relationship bin series, which is composed of bin with specific relative distance. In this algorithm, the bins with each object\u2019s relative distance to Pattern_S can be directly got by reference cutting at first. Then, they are labeled according to whether their relative distance is in matching threshold. Finally, the relative relationship bin series are obtained, which match the Pattern_S in all time.

In the research community of epidemiology, the spread of diseases is closely related to the spatial and social activities of patients, and the propagation of diseases greatly depends on the trajectory of a patient\u2019s social activities. Thus, tracing the back-propagation path of a virus and finding close contacts are meaningful to prevent the spread of diseases. This experiment assumed a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) carrier\u2019s walking path to find its close contacts. SARS is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin that is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The primary route of transmission for SARS is the contact of mucous membranes with respiratory droplets or fomites (World Health Organization, 2003). The research about respiratory droplets transmission shows that the largest droplets will totally evaporate before falling 2 m away (Xie et al., 2007). Therefore, a person will be identified as a close contact if the distance to the carrier (whose ID is 2 in Fig. 9\n) is less than 2 m. Therefore, this paper uses 2 m as the parameter for querying close contacts.",

To remain unnoticed, trackers usually stay within a certain range from the target to neither be found nor lose the target. This distance range is a critical parameter to build specific patterns for trackers. According to the sociological theory (Moore et al., 2010), trackers are easily found if their distance to the victim is less than 3 m. Therefore, this study set the parameter of 3 m as the lower distance limit for this query. On the other hand, the upper distance limit must guarantee that the target is within the tracker\u2019s sight. This study set the upper distance limit as 42 m to ensure that the tracker did not lose the target. This parameter was calculated according to the waiting time of intersections in this study area (30 s). Therefore, 30 s \u00d7 1.4 m/s = 42 m, where 1.4 m/s is the normal average walking speed (Fitzpatrick et al., 2006). Sometimes, the distance is probably larger than 42 m, which may cause the tracker to lose the target; thus, the tracker will speed up to follow the target. In this case, the tracker must find the target within 30 s because of the constraints of traffic lights. The conditions of tracker finding can be expressed as follows:(1)The distance between the tracker and target is always [3 m, 42 m);(2)The time that the distance between the tracker and target is not [3 m, 42 m) is below 30 s, which occurs only once while speeding up because of the traffic-light locations in the study area.\n",

This matrix was labeled with a legend of colors in Fig. 14\nthrough the Labeling operator, which illustrates changes in the relative trend motion of the other subjects compared to the walker. In Fig. 14, the red bins in the matrix mean that these subjects are accelerating towards the walker, orange bins mean that the subjects are decelerating towards the walker, gray bins mean that the subjects are accelerating away from the walker, blue bins mean that the subjects are decelerating away from the walker and yellow bins mean no change in distance and speed.

The proposed model presents an obvious advantage in terms of conducting three functions (Point extraction, Time drilling, Reference cutting) because these functions only require a simple query, while the absolute model requires additional relative relationship transformation. The other three functions (Querying close contacts, Finding tracker and Deriving the motion trend of crowd nearby) are meaningful to real situations and require a relatively complicated implementation. Therefore, this study compared the second set of three functions that were implemented by the proposed model and absolute model. In ArcGIS, \u201cBuffer\u201d and \u201cOverlay analysis\u201d were used to implement Querying close contacts. The point features of the reference subject\u2019s trajectory were the input features of Buffer analysis in ArcToolBox. The outputs of this operation were face features that represented the close-contact area. Then, the Intersect tool in Overlay analysis could be used to check the status of the subjects\u2019 trajectories inside or outside the close contact area. However, no appropriate tools exist in ArcGIS to directly implement Finding tracker or Deriving the motion trend of crowd nearby. In terms of Finding tracker, we computed each subject\u2019s distance relative to the reference subject at each time via coordinates in Geodatabase and filtered the subjects according to the conditions in Section 5.3. In terms of Deriving the motion trend of crowd nearby, we calculated all the subjects\u2019 relative speeds and relative accelerations relative to the reference subject and statistically counted five types of motion trends, as described in Section 5.4.",

The execution times of the proposed model were approximately 5\u201350% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function.

The second function was Deriving the motion trend of the crowd nearby, whose time-efficiency improvement was similar to that of Querying close contacts. The execution time of the proposed model was approximately 10% that of the absolute GIS method. Additionally, the improvement from the proposed model became significant if the dataset\u2019s records were larger than 3*107 (Fig. 19(c)).

However, in the proposed model, there is no need to build many buffer areas to recognize relationships in all time. It only executed once reference cutting to get all object\u2019s relationships to the carrier, no matter how many objects in the scenario. This is fundamental reason for the better performance of our model in this case study.

It is a complicated computation process in absolute GIS method. The proposed model directly extracted each object\u2019s relationship referred to the target in relative space by reference cutting.

In this model, the X and Y in STC are substituted as the reference and target objects, and the STB in STC are extended to store the data structure related to relative relationship among moving objects. To support the analysis of moving objects, this paper introduces six classes of operators according to the type of relationship outcome, namely, query processing, group relative dynamic calculation, transformation between absolute space and relative space, initial reference object transformation, attribute transformation, relative relationship dynamic pattern transformation. Then, two common used algorithms, relative relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching, are introduced on the base of these defined operators. The former algorithm organizes the relative relationship as three dimensions (Reference object, Target object and Time) based on the model\u2019s structure, and queries relative relationship by corresponding objects and time. The later algorithm implements reference cutting and labeling to match each object\u2019s relative motion with specific pattern, which simplifies similarity measure in absolute space. This study collected the trajectories of walking pedestrian and used these data to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. Finally, the proposed model was successfully tested in three real-life scenarios to analyze dynamic and complex relationships between moving objects. The results validated the capabilities of these designed functions and indicated that the proposed model saved up to 50%-95% execution time compared with traditional absolute GIS methods. And the proposed model could be widely applied in the domains of public health, security, individual-based services. Therefore, the contributions of this paper could be summarized as follows:(1)A relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) is proposed to construct, operate and analyze moving objects\u2019 relative relationships in relative space.(2)Relative space-based relationship-querying algorithm and relative dynamic pattern-matching algorithm are proposed on the base of the proposed model.(3)Three real-life scenarios are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of this proposed model in discovering interesting behavior hidden in crowd (e.g. querying close contact, finding tracker and deriving the crowd\u2019s motion trends). Moreover, the computational time of these real-life scenario analysis could save up to 50\u201395% while compared with absolute space based methods.\n",
