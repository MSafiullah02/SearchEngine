Such plans generally include steps to deal with internal hospital situations such as fire, loss of utilities, loss of services, or bomb threat, and external exigencies such as casualty management, severe weather, or a terrorist action involving use of weapons of mass destruction. While such plans offer important strategies to deal with events that pose threats to the entire hospital, it is unlikely that the hospital-wide plan contains specific plans related to unique HCT issues. Thus, a detailed plan to address specific HCT issues is also needed. The HCT plan should address the things that one can and should address now: emergency team, command structure, channels of communications, inpatient and outpatient capacity, reciprocal arrangements with other centers, public information, etc. Especially critical for the HCT program are arrangements for longitudinal outpatient care services, since HCT patients are especially reliant on intensive outpatient services over a long interval.",

            "text": "\n1\nEstablishment of a HCT emergency team. A HCT emergency preparedness team should be developed (Figure 2). This team will develop the specifics of the plan, organize the entire staff, be charged with conducting drills, overseeing training, monitoring performance during an emergency response, and ensuring that recovery efforts take place. The team should include representatives of multiple key services to gain as many perspectives as possible about what are potential vulnerabilities and to identify as many solutions as possible.2\nA command structure and listing of individual personnel in key roles. The team should develop a command structure list that identifies who is in charge of what. Listing the team by job title, rather than by individual, will make the structure more permanent and less subject to changes in personnel.3\nMechanism of communication. A list of individual staff members by job title should also be maintained in multiple locations since individual nodes of the communication network may be disrupted. Contact information for the staff should include multiple types of communication and should be maintained in multiple media forms. Examples of types of communication include pagers, land-based telephones, cellular phones, internet, and public media. Locations that this information should be placed include inpatient and outpatient nursing stations, stem cell laboratories, homes of key individuals, etc. Because this information will become outdated, a schedule for routine replacement, e.g., monthly or bi-monthly, should be implemented.4\nInpatient and outpatient capacity. An assessment of one\u2019s program\u2019s capacity, how it might be affected by an emergency, and planning for \u201csurge\u201d capacity or provisions for reduced capacity is advisable. One\u2019s center may face a shortage of inpatient or critical care beds due to either an influx of patients hospitalized from injuries or illness from the emergency event or an inability to discharge patients because of a lack of community services, housing or transportation. Similarly, outpatient and home care services may be severely affected resulting in a need to hospitalize outpatients. One consideration to weigh is whether there are any possibilities to temporarily increase capacity and what steps would be needed to make it happen. One should consider delay of new transplant procedures wherever possible to free up beds. Strong consideration should be given to relocation of patients whenever possible to communities not affected (see below). For patients needing intensive outpatient care that is disrupted by the emergency, one may consider admitting them early to ensure an inpatient bed.5\nReciprocal arrangements with other centers. Development of a relationship with one or more neighboring \u201cbuddy\u201d centers that may assist in assuming care of patients if one\u2019s center cannot accommodate needed patient care may be useful; joint practices and communications testing between the two centers periodically is advisable. One should consider a relationship of one center in the same FEMA district and one in a different FEMA district. Consider establishing videoconfenercing facilities to maintain educational programs in the event that some centers will be quarantined.6\nPublic Information tools and media relationship skills building. Learning some basic media relations skills is important. Knowing in advance the contact numbers of local radio and television stations that are good conduits of public information is important and may be used to communicate with staff (see below under Response). This is best done in conjunction with the public relations department of the hospital which is well placed to co-ordinate announcements from the hospital, especially its command center, as well as municipal, state and federal authorities so that a consistent message is conveyed.7\nBackup of patient and stem cell database. All hospital patient information systems have extensive backup precautions to prevent loss of patient data. The BMT program\u2019s customized database of patient and stem cell information may be part of the hospital system or maintained separately. If the latter, it is important to have backup systems in place, preferably with a copy of the database off site.8\nChecklist of specific HCT needs. A checklist of specific HCT concerns should be created and maintained (Figure 3). For each concern, the center should develop specific local plans. Below are suggestions based on various committee members\u2019 experiences of specific emergencies faced by their program.\n\u2022\nStaff. Staffing shortages for both inpatient and outpatient services may occur. Shortages may arise from disruption of staff from getting to and from work or some may need to be excluded from patient care. This is most relevant for an infectious or radiation event where certain staff may have exposures that would be hazardous for patients. Pregnant women may need special provisions for either infectious or radiation events. Provision for staff support (child care, transportation, etc) may be necessary since some emergencies may result in school or childcare closures, affecting dependent children of staff members. Some centers have set up on-site temporary childcare for staff needed to provide essential services. Relief of on-duty staff should also be planned. One should ensure that multiple means of communication with individual staff members are maintained (as noted above) since disruption of one or more types of communication may occur. Setting up a list of volunteer staff in advance can be useful.\u2022\nStem cell products. Electricity may be disrupted in any number of emergencies. Generally, generator backup systems will quickly restore electricity. One should assess whether or not critical stem cell collection equipment and stem cell processing instruments have access to electrical outlets that are supplied by the backup electrical supply. If any key instruments are not, corrective action in advance or alternative planning will reduce the likelihood of a crucial process disruption. In the event of an anticipated disaster, facilities should consider ordering additional tanks of liquid nitrogen in order to have a back up supply.\n \n \n Transportation of a stem cell product from collection site to transplant center may be disrupted and may jeopardize timely delivery (or collection) of stem cell products from other locales, especially of unrelated donor or cord blood products. Contact with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) or other donor registry/bank to coordinate delivery is crucial. If there is advance warning, one may consider earlier collection and delivery. If the center is scheduled to provide stem cells for another center, as for example the NMDP, the coordinator should inform the NMDP that the center is not able to collect cells from an unrelated donor and ship.\n \n \n Ability to conduct apheresis in patients or donors whose mobilization procedure has already begun may be affected. A donor or patient may be in the midst of mobilization when an emergency prevents timely collection of the product or the recipient may already have received an ablative conditioning regimen. Decisions as to aborting the collection or revision of the collection process may be needed.\u2022\nTransfusion support. Supply of blood products for patients in need of transfusion support may be threatened. When a disaster strikes a community, volunteer activities such as blood donation may be seriously affected or disrupted. Changes in transfusion thresholds may be necessary. Close communication with one\u2019s blood bank and regional blood collection center is crucial.\u2022\nInfection control. Development of a close working relationship with the Infection Control Officer or team in one\u2019s institution long in advance of an emergency is strongly encouraged. Infection control experts have much to teach transplant clinicians and likewise they have much to learn from transplant clinicians about the unique needs of HCT patients. Familiarity of the Infection Control team with specific HCT team\u2019s concerns and practices will facilitate useful and constructive advice during an emergency. If the emergency is an infectious event, this relationship will have crucial meaning. Criteria for determining if certain staff should be excluded need to be developed with the coordination with Infection Control. An assessment of the availability of at least some easily accessible negative pressure rooms available to assess outpatients - really critical for BMT patients is important, especially in the event of an infectious event.\u2022\nRelocation of patients. It may be necessary to consider the possibility of relocating patients away from the HCT center and dispersing them to local health care providers in communities not affected by disaster. If the center finds that it cannot provide key services, has a reduced capacity, or the public services outside of the center are compromised, then return of some (or most) patients to health providers in communities not affected may be the most prudent course of action. Whenever possible, this should be anticipated if there is advance warning, and, if not, done as early as possible once the need becomes apparent. This can alleviate pressure on overburdened staff and facilities and optimizes delivery of needed services to patients who cannot be relocated. If relocation is done, one should remember that arrangements for blood transfusion support is key, with appropriate communication as to provisions for irradiation and CMV appropriate products (or filtration alternatively).\u2022\nPublic services. Interruption of public services, such as transportation, potable water, sanitation, electricity, and other public services may have an enormous impact on one\u2019s ability to provide clinical services even if the center\u2019s internal operations are not affected. Interruption of public services will affect both patients and staff. If roads are blocked or public transportation disrupted, patients and staff may not be able to get to and from the center. This may lead to certain staff working overtime or the need to curtail services, especially outpatient clinics. Lack of basic services (or transportation) may make it impossible to discharge patients who could be ordinarily discharged. Flooding or structural damage to housing may lead to lack of residential facilities for patients who are temporary residents in the transplant center\u2019s community.\n",

Here\u2019s what we do for a terrorist attack during a flood\u2026 with and without electrical disruption. This type of planning quickly gets totally impractical and overwhelming. Instead, the emphasis should be to have a general plan that works for all possible disasters. (This can be fairly simple - collect information, convene the team, get the tickler list, start talking, make assignments [including collecting more information], decide on next meeting time, get started with implementation). Once the plan is in place, you can add some event-specific details, like in Florida or Gulf coast, add the hurricane. In Oklahoma, add the tornado, etc. Some planning for specific types of emergencies one\u2019s center is most likely to face is advisable. For infectious event emergencies, minimizing the risk for spread of the infection is of highest priority. Brainstorming ways to compensate for possible disruption of public services and a discussion of how the staff can help each other may be useful.",

            "text": "The SARS epidemic, starting in March 2003, caught Toronto, and indeed, Canada unprepared. By the time it was contained in Toronto it had involved more than 250 probable cases, resulted in 43 deaths and cost an estimated one billion dollars. A striking aspect to the healthcare workers directly involved at the onset of the epidemic was the uncertainty surrounding the mode of transmission of the disease, its surveillance, containment and management. While initially this led to some confusion, healthcare workers experienced a rather steep learning curve as the epidemic progressed and more information about the nature of the infective organism became known and available. In retrospect, several issues emerge as important to the management of a HCT Program during this period. One was surveillance at the hospital entrance of patients with clinic appointments. Requirements of surveillance included obtaining a history of contact with possible or probable cases, a history of symptoms, including fever, and a tympanic temperature measurement. The challenge was to distinguish possible symptoms of SARS from the expected symptoms and signs in the many patients with febrile neutropenia visiting the clinic. Some of these patients required further evaluation, and because they were initially to be regarded as possible cases of SARS, physical examination needed to be conducted in a negative pressure room. This was a particular challenge for those medical facilities that lacked adequate numbers of (or indeed, any) negative pressure rooms. Moreover, patient (and staff- separate entrance) surveillance invariably resulted in queuing at hospital entrances at peak times which was uncomfortable to those waiting outside in the cold. The lessons here include the need for an adequate number of negative pressure rooms in the out-patient clinic setting and the importance of regular information sessions to medical staff regarding the outbreak so that they can interact effectively with patients (and their co-workers).",

            "text": "One approach in containing the outbreak was to quarantine healthcare workers to their home because they exhibited fever and/or respiratory symptoms (in most cases an innocuous URI) and had no likely contact or individuals who had contact with possible cases of SARS. These individuals were monitored regularly by public health personnel. Either way they were no longer available as healthcare workers resulting in reduced staffing in medical units, including HCT programs. The lesson here is that transplant volume needs to be adjusted nimbly to accommodate the considerable reductions in healthcare staff that can occur quickly.",

It was particularly important to protect staff in regular contact with immunocompromised patients not only for their own sake but to ensure the safety of the transplant unit.",

For institutions performing HCT that lacked their own intensive care units, this posed a major logistical issue in planning transplants. In some cases, they were postponed because of the lack of availability of acute care services or were transferred to other institutions if this was permitted by government directives. The lesson from this experience is that input from transplant directors is important when planning is done and should be integrated at all levels of decision-making.",
