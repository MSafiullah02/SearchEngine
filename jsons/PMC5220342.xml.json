As reported previously7, the induction of ER-to-Golgi blockade by the dominant-negative Arf1-Q71L mutant induced the cell-surface expression of ER core-glycosylated wild-type CFTR and also the folding-deficient \u0394F508-CFTR via unconventional protein secretion (Fig. 1a\u2013d, lane 3). To exclude the possibility that these results were caused by a nonspecific inhibition of membrane protein internalization, we repeated the experiments with the inhibitor of dynamins (dynasore) or the dominant-negative dynamin mutant (dynamin2-K44A) that had been shown to inhibit the internalization of plasma membrane proteins, such as transferrin receptor and CFTR1920. As shown in Figure S1, although these treatments increased the cell-surface expression of transferrin receptor and complex-glycosylated wild-type CFTR by 40\u201380% (Figure S1a,b), dynasore and dynamin2-K44A neither affected Arf1-Q71L-mediated cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR nor induced cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR (Figure S1b\u2013d).",

Notably, depletion of Sec16A abolished the cell-surface expression of CFTR mediated by both the conventional and the unconventional secretion pathways. Sec16A silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the surface expression of complex-glycosylated CFTR (Fig. 1a,b lane 2). Moreover, Sec16A depletion strongly diminished the unconventional cell-surface expression of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1a,b, lane 4) and also interfered with the cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR induced by Arf1-Q71L (Fig. 1c,d, lane 4). However, depletion of Sec16B and core COPII components, such as Sec23, Sec24, Sec13, and Sec31, did not affect the unconventional cell-surface transport of \u0394F508-CFTR (Fig. 1e,f and Figure S2). Immunoblotting and mRNA quantitation confirmed the effects of RNAi on the depletion of Sec16 and core COPII components (Figure S3).",

HeLa cells were used instead of HEK293 cells for morphological analyses, because they attach more firmly to coverslips, which prevents the loss of cells and the derangement of cell shapes during immunofluorescence procedures21. HeLa cells were transfected with extracellular HA-tagged wild-type or \u0394F508 CFTR in order to identify cell-surface CFTR under non-permeabilized conditions. Some cells were cotransfected with the GDP-restricted Sar1-T39N mutant to block COPII-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport22. In control cells, the wild-type CFTR was abundantly expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2a), while the folding-deficient \u0394F508-CFTR failed to reach the cell surface (Fig. 2b). The blockade of ER-to-Golgi transport by Sar1-T39N evoked the cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR (Fig. 2c). Notably, depletion of Sec16A abolished the unconventional cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR induced by Sar1-T39N (Fig. 2d,e). Taken together, the results indicate that Sec16A, but not core COPII components, is required for the unconventional secretion of CFTR.",

The blockade of ER-to-Golgi transport by Arf1-Q71L induced the cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR in HeLa cells (Fig. 3a,b). Interestingly, Arf1-Q71L altered the intracellular localization of Sec16A. In control cells, Sec16A displayed typical ERES localization, in which Sec16A puncta were mostly concentrated in the juxtanuclear area (Fig. 3a and HA-negative cells in Fig. 3c; arrowheads). However, when the ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked by Arf1-Q71L, Sec16A dispersed into more peripheral regions and the Sec16A puncta appeared in >80% of the cytoplasmic area (Fig. 3b\u2013d, arrows). These results are comparable to a recent finding that ER relocalization of GRASP is a requisite for unconventional secretion of CFTR21.",

Endogenous GRASP55 and a low level of GRASP55-Myc, which does not induce unconventional secretion (Figure S5a), were expressed at the typical perinuclear Golgi apparatus, and Sec16A-positive ERES were enriched around that region to facilitate ER-to-Golgi transport (Fig. 4a,b). Notably, in HeLa cells with a high level of GRASP55-Myc expression, which does induce unconventional \u0394F508-CFTR secretion (Figure S5b), the Sec16A puncta and GRASP55 were significantly redistributed to the entire cellular area (Fig. 4c, arrows). Subsequent immunofluorescence colocalization analyses assessing both the percentage of overlapping area and the pixel colocalization correlation between Sec16A and ER markers revealed that the relocalized Sec16A puncta were highly colocalized with the ER-marker proteins, suggesting that Sec16A relocalized to the peripheral ER area (Fig. 5). The peripheral localization of Sec16A increased Manders\u2019 Colocalization Coefficient (MCC) due to an increment in the co-incident coefficient between the fractions of Sec16A and ER marker proteins (Fig. 5c,g).",

The endogenous GRASP55 and Sec16A in HeLa cells were labeled with fluorophore-tagged antibodies. In control cells, although both GRASP55 and Sec16A were enriched in the juxtanuclear regions, analyses at higher magnifications revealed that the GRASP55 and Sec16A were mostly located in separate regions (Fig. 6a). In addition, Sec16A puncta located in the cell periphery were completely devoid of GRASP55 (Fig. 6a). Stimuli that induce unconventional secretion, such as ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade, significantly redistributed and colocalized the Sec16A and GRASP55. Treatment with thapsigargin, which induces ER stress by depleting Ca2+ stores in the ER lumen, and coexpression with Arf1-Q71L or Sar1-T39N, which induces ER-to-Golgi blockade, redistributed GRASP55 from the juxtanuclear region to entire cellular area, significantly increasing the overall colocalization of GRASP55 with Sec16A puncta, especially in the peripheral regions (Fig. 6b\u2013e). Electron microscopy further supported the finding that Arf1-Q71L-induced ER-to-Golgi blockade redistributed the Golgi protein GRASP55 from the Golgi to the ER, where Sec16A is localized (Figure S6).",

Again, a high level of GRASP55 expression or ER-to-Golgi blockade by Sar1-T39N relocalized the Sec16A puncta into >80% of the whole cellular area in HeLa cells, whereas only ~20% of the cellular area was Sec16A-positive in control cells. In contrast, neither GRASP55 expression nor ER-to-Golgi blockade by Arf1 and Sar1 mutants significantly altered the Sec31A distribution. Morphometric quantification indicated that Sec31A remained in ~15% of the whole cellular area of cells with GRASP55 overexpression or Sar1-T39N (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the cellular distribution of Sec31A seemed to be contracted by the ER-to-Golgi blockade, especially by Sar1-T39N, although the change was not statistically significant (Fig. 7c\u2013e). Coimmunostaining with \u03b3-tubulin revealed that Sec31A became highly concentrated at the minus ends of the microtubules, known as the centrosome or the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC; Figure S7). In addition, the distribution of Sec24, another core component of COPII, was also not affected by ER-to-Golgi blockade (Figure S8). Collectively, the results suggest that the formation of GRASP-mediated unconventional vesicles is accompanied by the assistance of the ERES organizer/regulator protein Sec16A, but is independent of the core COPII components.",

Therefore, we next investigated the role of IRE1 in Sec16A-mediated unconventional secretion. As shown in Fig. 8a,b, the depletion of IRE1\u03b1 by siRNA strongly inhibited Arf1-Q71L-induced surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR in HEK293 cells, but supplementation with exogenous Sec16A rescued the effect of mutant Arf1 that induced the cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR. Furthermore, consistent with the mutant Arf1 results, GRASP55-induced \u0394F508-CFTR rescue was inhibited by IRE1 silencing and recovered by Sec16A replenishment (Fig. 8c,d). Immunocytochemistry results further supported the notion that IRE1 is an upstream regulator of Sec16A expression and localization during unconventional secretion. IRE1\u03b1 depletion reduced the overall Sec16A expression levels in HeLa cells, and the increased Sec16A-positive area resulting from Arf1-Q71L or GRASP55 overexpression was diminished from 91% to 19% (Fig. 9).",

Subsequently, Sec16 analogs were found in other species and shown to be involved in the COPII-mediated ER exit of cargo proteins in those organisms. However, the specific and precise role of Sec16 in COPII-mediated transport is still not fully established. For example, Stephens et al. suggested that Sec16 is a central organizer of COPII vesicles that defines ERES localization and recruits core COPII components in a stoichiometric fashion2730. In contrast, Glick et al. proposed that Sec16A regulates COPII turnover and consequently influences the stability of ERES instead of organizing COPII vesicle formation31. Although there is some debate about whether Sec16 recruits COPII to ERES or the other way around31, it is generally agreed that Sec16 associates with core COPII components and is required for export-site assembly and function32. Our results indicate that Sec16 is also required for the COPII-independent ER exit of secretory cargos. Considering the scaffolding role of Sec16, it will be intriguing to identify the binding partners of Sec16A during ER stress or ER-to-Golgi blockade. Such investigations should aid our understanding of the molecular components and the big picture of ERES for unconventional protein secretion.",

In Drosophila larval muscle cells, it has been reported that parts of dGRASP colocalize with Sec16 and participate in the ER exit of the integrin subunit \u03b1PS233. However, it is unclear as to whether dGRASP and Sec16 mediate unconventional secretion of \u03b1PS2 in Drosophila. Furthermore, dGRASP and Sec16 are enriched around the nucleus in Drosophila muscle cells during \u03b1PS2 secretion33. In contrast, GRASP55 and Sec16A relocalize to the cell periphery and mediate unconventional secretion of CFTR upon ER stress or ER-to-Golgi blockade in mammalian cells (Figs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9). Notably, the core COPII component Sec31 did not relocalize under those conditions (Fig. 7). Instead of dispersing Sec31, Sar1-T39N seemed to cause Sec31 to move to a more central distribution relative to the MTOC (Figure S7), suggesting the possibility that there is a signal that induces the relocalization of Sec31 into the minus end of microtubules during strong ER-to-Golgi blockade. The ER-Golgi interface and ERES are concentrated in the juxtanuclear region adjacent to the MTOC. The COPII vesicles that depart ERES initially travel towards the minus ends of the microtubules, which transport cargo proteins to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and eventually to the Golgi32. After being processed in the Golgi, the secretory cargos leave the trans-Golgi network and travel towards the plus ends of the microtubules via vesicular trafficking to reach the cell surface. The peripheral movement of Sec16 puncta raises the possibility that ER stress signals separate Sec16A from the core COPII components by transporting Sec16A towards the plus ends of the microtubules. The unconventional secretion of CFTR induced by ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and nocodazole7, indicating that it requires vesicular trafficking via microtubules. The peripheral localization of Sec16A and ERES for unconventional secretion might facilitate the direct trafficking of secretory vesicles to the cell surface via short-distance, plus-end trafficking on microtubules that bypasses the Golgi.",

An alternative explanation of this finding would be that Arf1-Q71L or other potentially cytotoxic treatments may nonspecifically increase cell-surface expression of membrane proteins by inhibiting internalization of surface proteins rather than activation of a secretion event. As shown in Figure S1, the inhibition of membrane-protein internalization by dynasore and dynamin2-K44A did not evoke the cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR, suggesting that inhibition of protein internalization cannot account for the cell-surface expression of core-glycosylated CFTR during ER stress and ER-to-Golgi blockade. An interesting finding to note is that the inhibition of cell surface-protein internalization did not significantly affect CFTR transported unconventionally to the cell surface by Arf1-Q71L (Figure S1b\u2013d), while it did increase the cell-surface expression of conventionally transported membrane proteins by 40\u201380% (Figure S1a,b). These results suggest that Arf1-Q71L inhibited the internalization of surface proteins. Considering that the folding-deficient membrane proteins that are transported to the cell surface remain under the control of peripheral protein quality control34, the inhibition of internalization would be an additional benefit that increases their retention time at the plasma membrane, although the inhibition of internalization alone is not capable of inducing the cell-surface expression.",

Sec16A was also required for the GRASP55 overexpression-induced cell-surface expression of \u0394F508-CFTR (Figure S4), and Sec16A colocalized and associated with GRASP55 during ER stress-induced unconventional secretion (Fig. 6). As a scaffold for organizing ERES37, the Sec16A that is dispersed peripherally by ER stress signals may recruit GRASP55, which can then bring CFTR to newly established ERES for unconventional secretion. The reverse also seems possible, however, because the overexpression of GRASP55, which induces unconventional trafficking of \u0394F508-CFTR but not ER stress signals7, evoked Sec16A colocalization and peripheral dispersion (Fig. 4e). In any case, the association between Sec16A, an organizer of ERES, and GRASP, a cargo-recruiting factor, will be a critical event for the initiation of unconventional secretion of CFTR.",

To maintain homeostasis in the ER lumen, the ER responds to an excess of unfolded proteins and relieves ER stress by triggering UPR signaling pathways38. Generally, UPRs reduce the protein load in the ER by decreasing the transcription and translation of secretory proteins, and by directing misfolded proteins into the ER-associated degradation pathway39. In addition, UPRs may activate the secretion of misfolded proteins via the unconventional route to relieve ER burden7. IRE1, one of the three major branches of UPR signaling16, was shown to be responsible for the generation of new ERES and the upregulation of Sec16A during chronic overload of a secretory cargo17. IRE1 was also shown previously to mediate ER stress-induced unconventional secretion of CFTR7. Our current findings suggest that the IRE1-mediated UPR is a major upstream signal that regulates the generation and anchoring of Sec16A at the ERES involved in ER stress-induced and GRASP overexpression-mediated unconventional secretion (Fig. 8).",

It is possible, however, that a simple reduction in Sec16A levels by IRE1 knockdown, rather than by true inhibition of Sec16A redistribution, would lower the Sec16A in immunofluorescence to subthreshold levels more profoundly in the peripheral regions than in the perinuclear region. Although we analyzed the immunofluorescence images with an increased laser gain to minimize the problem (Fig. 9), our results cannot completely rule out this possibility. In any case, profound reductions in peripheral Sec16A levels are associated with decreases in unconventional secretion of CFTR. Considering that peripheral redistribution of GRASP55 is critical for the unconventional secretion of CFTR21, and that GRASP55 associates with Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade (Fig. 6), peripherally localized Sec16A would play an important role in the ER exit of cargos during ER-to-Golgi blockade. Therefore, accumulated evidence suggests that 1) GRASP is redistributed from the Golgi to the ER during ER stress and recognizes some cargos subjected for unconventional secretion, particularly membrane proteins such as CFTR that have a PDZ-binding motif at their C-terminus, and 2) GRASP associates with the Sec16A-containing protein complex, which delivers the cargos to the vesicles that depart from the ER membrane during unconventional secretion.",

Recently, Joo et al. reported that ATG1/ULK-mediated phosphorylation at the Ser846 residue of Sec16A is essential for the COPII-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking under basal physiologic conditions41. Considering the finding that ATG1 is also involved in the ER stress-induced, unconventional trafficking of CFTR7, it will be an interesting task to investigate whether phosphorylation(s) at specific Sec16A loci is required for unconventional secretion. Increasing evidence indicates that autophagy components are involved in various kinds of unconventional trafficking. For instance, coronaviruses use nonlipidated, ATG8/LC3-positive vesicles for replication, which emerge from the ER by a COPII-independent mechanism42. However, this pathway is not dependent on ATG742, whereas the ER stress-induced, unconventional trafficking of CFTR is dependent on both ATG7 and ATG87. Therefore, it appears that diverse cargos, from viral particles to mammalian membrane proteins, employ several combinations of autophagy components for their travel to the cell surface after ER exit.",

In addition, we showed that IRE1\u03b1 acts as an upstream signal for ER stress-associated unconventional secretion by modulating Sec16A. These results provide new insights into the global role of Sec16A as a common mediator of ER export. Furthermore, the identification of Sec16A as a platform for the exit of folding-deficient proteins from the ER will contribute to therapeutic strategies for diseases resulting from defects in the transport of misfolded proteins.",
