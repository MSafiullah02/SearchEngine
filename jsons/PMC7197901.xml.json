Indeed, addition of plasma to recombinant soluble human ACE2 inhibited activity in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 1); this was confirmed by HPLC analysis. For example, a 10\u2010fold dilution of plasma (10 \u03bcl in 100 \u03bcl) reduced the rate of QFS cleavage by approximately half. Similar results were observed for the full\u2010length, membrane\u2010bound form. Inhibition of ACE2 activity was not confined to the fluorescent substrate, since Ang II cleavage was similarly reduced by plasma or by a 40% acetonitrile\u2010soluble fraction of plasma (Fig. 2). The inhibitor was present in similar amounts in plasma samples from individual volunteers, since the inhibition of recombinant ACE2 by 15 \u03bcl plasma was 37.7 \u00b1 1.3% (mean \u00b1s.e.m., n= 17).

This result suggests that the inhibitor is unlikely to be a large protein; this conclusion is supported by the relative resistance of the reconstituted 40% ACN fraction to heating (80\u00b0C for 20 min), a treatment which resulted in the further precipitation of proteins but reduced the inhibition of ACE2 by only \u223c30%. The 40% ACN fraction was also used to assess the specificity of the inhibition; whereas addition of this fraction (following drying and resuspension in aqueous buffer, equivalent to 50 \u03bcl neat plasma in a 100 \u03bcl total assay volume) to ACE2 inhibited activity by > 80%, neprilysin and thimet oligopeptidase were unaffected, and endothelin\u2010converting enzyme was inhibited by < 25%. Fractionation of plasma by size exclusion chromatography (PD\u201010 column, exclusion limit 5000 Da) also indicates that the inhibitor is relatively small, since its elution was delayed (Table 2). Conversely, inhibitory activity was not retained on a C18 reverse\u2010phase column (Sep\u2010Pak; Table 2), suggesting a compound of low hydrophobicity. When applied to ion exchange columns, the inhibitor did not bind to the anion exchange medium and could not be eluted from the cation exchanger (Table 2), suggesting a cationic substance.",

Preliminary results suggest that plasma ACE2 is indeed elevated in these conditions, as well as in rat models of chronic liver disease (Herath et al. 2007; R. A. Lew, J. S. Lubel, C. Herath, L. M. Burrell, P. W. Angus & A. I. Smith, unpublished observations) and acute renal failure (E. Velkoska, R. Dean & L. M. Burrell, unpublished observations). Thus the appearance of ACE2 in plasma may serve as a biomarker of pathologies where increased tissue ACE2 expression is observed. Future studies aimed at determining the relationship between plasma ACE2 levels and myocardial or liver disease are currently underway.",
