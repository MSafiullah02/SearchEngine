In contrast with the more commonly used mammalian IgG antibodies, IgY antibodies do not activate mammalian complement, nor do they cross-react with Fc-receptors, mammalian rheumatoid factor, or human anti-mouse antibodies, thus eliminating the cause of false-positive results in immunological assays. Moreover, IgY can easily be sampled noninvasively from the egg yolk, compared with the stressful bleeding of animals to obtain serum. From an economical point of view, the antibody production of a hen roughly corresponds to that of a large mammal such as a sheep or goat, whereas maintenance costs are relatively low (Larsson et al., 1993; Schade et al., 2001, 2005; Zhang, 2003). Thus, a substantial amount of antibody can be produced from just one hen (up to 40 g of total IgY per chicken per year), of which 1 to 10% can be expected to be antigen-specific (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002). This vast quantity of antibodies may pave the way for new fields of application such as immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis. Chickens are able to respond better to mammalian antigens providing specific IgY antibody because of the phylogenetic distance between the animal classes Mammalia and Aves, as for instance the rabbit immune system.",

Large amounts of antibody are required for the production of therapeutic antibodies, and this could be achieved either by increasing the number of animals used or by extending the maintenance period (De Ceuninck et al., 2001; Kollberg et al., 2003; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2005). The aim of the current work was to generate large amounts of antibody for immunological detection of toxins, and to identify a suitable period that animals could be kept to ensure high yields of specific antibodies at a reasonable cost. Toxins with significance in bioterrorism such as the plant toxin ricin and the botulinum neurotoxins type A and B (BoNT/A, BoNT/B) were therefore chosen for these immunization studies.",

In mice, the half-maximal lethal dose (LD50) of ricin is around 5 \u03bcg/kg of BW when inhaled or after i.v. injection (Bradberry et al., 2003). Ricin consists of a 30- to 32-kDa A-chain and a 33-kDa B-chain, whereas agglutinin occurs as a tetramer of 2 A- and 2 B-chains of similar size to those of ricin (Olsnes et al., 1974). On the molecular level, the B-chain binds to sugar residues on the cell surface and facilitates the uptake and release of the A-chain into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm the A-chain, an RNA N-glycosidase, inactivates the ribosome by removing an adenine from 28S ribosomal RNA (Lord et al., 2003). The abundance of the castor plant, the ease with which crude ricin may be extracted from the seeds, and the toxicity make ricin a relevant candidate substance for bioterrorism. Ricin is classified as a category B agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and it falls under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regulation of chemical weapons (Audi et al., 2005).",

These neurotoxins are secreted as 150-kDa proteins comprising a 100-kDa heavy chain and a 50-kDa light chain and are packed within a high-molecular-weight noncovalent, multimeric protein complex. The heavy chain facilitates binding, uptake, and release of the light chain into peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. Here the light chain, a zinc-dependent endopeptidase, targets certain molecules of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment receptor (SNARE) complex, which is involved in vesicle fusion and release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. Proteolysis of the SNARE complex molecules leads to a block of neurotransmitter release, resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis (Simpson, 2004). Because of their extreme toxicity, the botulinum neurotoxins are classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in category A of bioterrorism agents.",

Laying capacity started to decrease between 70 and 80 wk after the first immunization, corresponding to an age of nearly 2 yr. During the first year of the study the laying capacity of chickens 19 and 21 was close to the maximal number of eggs (300 to 320 eggs), whereas a 30 to 70% decrease in egg production was noted (2 to 5 eggs per week) during the second year (see Table 1). A different development was observed for chickens 22 and 23 because of a laying depression during the first year (see Figures 1B and 1D). This dramatic reduction in laying capacity was observed between wk 20 and 30 (corresponding with the summer months, July and August 2005) for no obvious reason, because all hens were kept in a single room within an air-conditioned animal facility.",

Taking into account the 30% increase in IgY content per egg (50 to 65 mg/egg at the end of the second year) and comparing it to the decline in egg numbers, a maintenance period of 2 yr was determined as the period that allows a relatively stable yield of IgY. This, however, may vary between individuals. Insofar as the individual performance of immunized hens is already monitored, the maintenance period may be extended until bird performance decreases to about 4 eggs per week. Keeping hens for a second year extends the time for antibody production, thus doubling the yield of specific IgY antibodies.",

Anti-ricin IgY (example shown is chicken 22) in different concentrations, were premixed with 10 ng/mL of ricin and incubated on Vero cells, as described in Materials and Methods. As controls, viable cells without ricin treatment (medium) and cells treated with ricin in the absence of blocking antibodies are shown. B) Anti-ricin IgY block toxicity of ricin in vivo. Five BALB/c mice per group were challenged i.p. with 200 \u03bcL of the mixture containing 1 \u03bcg ricin [5 \u00d7 50% lethal dose (LD50)] and 200 \u03bcg of IgY from either chicken 22 (H22, closed symbols) or an irrelevant control animal (open symbols). Animals were monitored over 10 d postinjection. Survival is shown as a Kaplan-Meier plot. C) Anti-botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)/A IgY blocks BoNT/A toxicity in vivo. Five BALB/c mice per group were challenged i.p. with 200 \u03bcL of the mixture containing 100 pg of BoNT/A (10 \u00d7 LD50) and 100 \u03bcg of IgY from chicken 29 (H29; closed symbols), or from a control animal (open symbols). Animals were monitored over the next 10 d. Survival is shown as a Kaplan-Meier plot. D) Anti-BoNT/B IgY blocks BoNT/B toxicity in vivo. Mice were challenged i.p. with 200 \u03bcL of the mixture containing 50 pg of BoNT/B (10 \u00d7 LD50) and 100 \u03bcg of IgY from chicken 23 (H23; closed symbols; 5 animals) or 100 \u03bcg of irrelevant IgY (open symbols; 2 animals). Animals were monitored over the next 10 d and the survival is shown as a Kaplan-Meier plot.",
