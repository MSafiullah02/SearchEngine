A potential solution for this shortage would be to establish mobile ambulatory hospitals that could be staffed for cardiopulmonary support services and could be moved throughout the country to provide the necessary healthcare support. This might utilize units already available through the Department of Defense or in the future be engineered and mobilized by the government for use and deployment. It would also be important to establish a healthcare team composed of nursing staff, technicians and physicians (critical care, pulmonologists, infectious disease specialists, advanced heart failure specialists, etc.) that would be assigned to these mobile, ambulatory hospitals. Such a model would require that the dedicated healthcare team be released from their professional duties in their communities and state licensure allowances would need to be implemented. This special force of healthcare personnel would provide efficient expertise in the treatment of any panepidemic.",

Garry, M.D., Ph.fertile environments for innovation. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly every country and impacted life across the globe. Due to the pandemic, healthcare systems, hospitals and intensive care units are functioning beyond their capacity and the interruption of supply chains have resulted in shortages of equipment (i.e. ventillators), intensive care beds, medications, testing centers and PAPR (Powered Air Purifying Respirators) for healthcare workers. While the current challenges seem to be unprecedented (although it most likely will not eclipse the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918), there are healthcare delivery models that were used in the past and may also serve as a model for the current and future pandemics. The advent of the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) in WWII and later in subsequent years is credited with the saving of thousands of lives 1 . These \"temporary\" hospitals (as they could be moved every month if necessary) were deployed to the frontlines in order to provide lifesaving trauma care to injured soldiers near the battlefield. While many were instrumental in the genesis of these MASH units, Dr. Michael DeBakey helped organize and promote this concept despite initial resistance 1 . These MASH units ultimately resulted in shorter evacuation times, rapid triage, successful resuscitation of the wounded and a reduction in the number of casualties. These MASH units were known for their mobility and adaptability and individual MASH units provided care for hundreds of patients at a time. These units have been extensively and successfully used in the Korean, Vietnam, Gulf and Iraqi Wars 1 . The healthcare delivery provided by these units provided numerous medical advances and may serve as a platform for healthcare crises. According to the American Hospital Association, U. S. hospitals have decreased in number since the 1990s with approximately 6,100 hospitals in operation in 2018 2 . These hospitals have 924,107 staffed beds, 97,776 intensive care beds and collectively have an average occupancy rate of 65%",
