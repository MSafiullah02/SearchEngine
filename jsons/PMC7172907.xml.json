In January 2020, a novel enveloped RNA coronavirus was identified as the cause, and by January 7, 2020, it was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). By early-April 2020, the virus has spread widely across the world with over 1.5 million confirmed cases, which are increasing daily. The WHO has declared a public health emergency.1 Despite worldwide spread, the epidemiological and clinical patterns of 2019-nCoV among children were initially unclear. Recently, public health officials announced the first death of an infant with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Cook County, Illinois, making identification of the features of COVID-19 in children of paramount importance. As such, we wish to present the findings of the largest retrospective study thus far of epidemiologic characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID-19.2\n",

Most children originated from Hubei province, but there was significant disease spread to surrounding provinces. Children were selected if they were exposed to a COVID-19 case within the last 2 weeks or lived in an epidemic area (ie, Hubei province) or community where COVID-19 cases were reported. In addition, they were also included if they lived in a nonepidemic area where COVID-19 cases were not reported, but had 2 of the following conditions: (1) clinical findings defined as fever, upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, fatigue; (2) laboratory findings of leukopenia, lymphopenia, increased CRP; and (3) abnormal chest X-ray findings (unspecified). Confirmed cases were confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens or blood samples. Patients could also be confirmed with genetic sequencing of respiratory tract or blood samples. The patients who were not confirmed, but had been excluded from influenza and other common respiratory infections were labeled as suspected diagnosis. Patients were further stratified by severity into asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical (see Table I\n), based on clinical and examination findings, and associated complications.2\n",

In children, common presentation of COVID-19 may be asymptomatic, or limited to pharyngitis or cough, or only GI symptoms.2 Approximately half of pediatric patients present with fever, far less frequent than adults, and providers should be aware of these differences from adult household contacts.9\n,\n10 In this study, some children had no clinical symptoms but positive chest CT findings, which were not specified; however, findings identified in other studies include ground glass opacities, local and bilateral patchy shadowing, interstitial abnormalities, and consolidation.5\n,\n11 Thus, radiographs play an important role in diagnostic workup of COVID-19. In addition, patients with more moderate findings may warrant a more extensive laboratory workup. Current CDC guidelines suggest testing only if having a risk factor plus clinical features, typically cough, lower respiratory symptoms, and fever. Consideration may be given to enhanced pediatric testing, as many infected children may be unidentified carriers, thus spreading the disease throughout the community.",
