Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) and most of them are transmitted to vertebrates by mosquitoes or ticks (Gubler, Kuno, & Markoff, 2007). Important human pathogens are Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV; Gould & Solomon, 2008). These viruses cause major outbreaks with a variety of disease symptoms, including encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. In severe cases, the mortality rates range from below 1% to 50% (WHO, 2012a, WHO, 2012b, WHO, 2012c, WHO, 2012d).",

RNAi can act to reduce viral loads by inhibition of viral protein expression and transcription of viral genomes (Sidahmed & Wilkie, 2010). The RNAi strategy has been shown to be effective against multiple mammalian host viruses such as Coronavirus (Shi et al., 2005), vesicular stomatitis virus (Otsuka et al., 2007), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Ahluwalia et al., 2008), H1N1 influenza A virus (Song, Liu, Gao, Jiang, & Huang, 2010), and hepatitis C virus (HCV; Pfeffer & Baumert, 2010).",

            "text": "The effector molecules of the RNAi mechanism are small RNA molecules of 20\u201330 nucleotides in length. There are several categories of small RNAs, and in this review, I will focus on the two most described molecules, miRNAs and siRNAs. The processing and generation of miRNAs and siRNAs is depicted in Fig. 4.1\n. Within the nucleus, pri-miRNA molecules are generated by RNA polymerase II transcription (Lee et al., 2004). These pri-miRNA molecules have a hairpin-shaped structure and are about 70 nucleotides in length. The double-stranded RNA structure within the hairpin is subsequently recognized by a nuclear protein called DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8; Landthaler, Yalcin, & Tuschl, 2004). Thereafter, DGCR8 interacts with the RNA-cutting enzyme Drosha to generate miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The pre-miRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 (Lee et al., 2002, Lund et al., 2004). Once in the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNAs are cleaved into 22-nt mature miRNAs by an RNase III-like enzyme termed Dicer (Bernstein, Caudy, Hammond, & Hannon, 2001). The mature miRNA duplex then undergoes an ATP-dependent unwinding process and a single strand is loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The miRNA binds to miRNA recognition elements (MRE) which are mostly located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of mRNAs (Bartel, 2009). Binding of a miRNA to its mRNA target typically leads to translational repression and exonucleolytic mRNA decay, although highly complementary targets can be cleaved endonucleolytically as well (Filipowicz, Bhattacharyya, & Sonenberg, 2008).",

Furthermore, it has been shown that exogenous dsRNA molecules can also be incorporated in the RNAi pathway. The dsRNA molecules can be transfected into the cell cytoplasm, taken up from the environment, or produced in virus-infected cells as RNA replicative intermediates (Hammond, Caudy, & Hannon, 2001). These dsRNA molecules are then processed by Dicer into siRNAs. Alternatively, exogenous synthetic 21\u201329 nt siRNAs can be transfected directly into the cytoplasm (Elbashir et al., 2001). The siRNA molecules undergo an ATP-depending unwinding process and a single strand is incorporated in the RISC complex, similarly as with the processing of miRNAs. In contrast to miRNAs, siRNAs only induce degradation of the perfectly base-paired target mRNA (Dykxhoorn, Novina, & Sharp, 2003).",

In virus-infected mammalian cells, small RNAs have been identified (Parameswaran et al., 2010, Yeung et al., 2009) but it remains unclear whether they contribute to an antiviral response (Haasnoot and Berkhout, 2011, Sidahmed and Wilkie, 2010). In contrast, mammalian-encoded miRNAs have been reported to target and inhibit viral gene expression. For example, miRNA miR-32 targets two different sequences (located in the 3\u2032UTR and the open reading frame 2) in the genome of primate foamy virus type 1, thereby inhibiting viral translation and replication (Lecellier et al., 2005). Furthermore, similar findings were reported for miR-24 and miR-93 in vesicular stomatitis virus infection (Otsuka et al., 2007); miR-29a during HIV infection (Ahluwalia et al., 2008); and miR-323, -491, and -654 in influenza H1N1 infection (Song et al., 2010). These findings are indicative for the importance of the host RNAi in modulating the replication efficiency of the infecting viruses and point out that harnessing this pathway could represent a powerful antiviral method.",

The number of E-positive cells was 30% and 83% lower in cells transfected with the plasmid encoding the siRNA against C and NS5, respectively. In addition, a decrease in RNA levels (65%) and virus particle production (60%) was achieved in cells transfected with the siRNA against C (McCown, Diamond, & Pekosz, 2003). Similar results were observed in Vero cells using siRNAs targeting the NS5 gene (Ong, Choo, Chu, & Ng, 2006) and the E gene (Bai et al., 2005) and in HTB-11 cells when the C gene was targeted (Yang et al., 2008). Also, WNV replication and virus particle production was found attenuated when siRNAs were applied targeting the 3\u2032UTRs of the viral genome (Anthony, Bai, Krishnan, Fikrig, & Koski, 2009). Taken together, these observations indicate that pretreatment of cells with siRNAs directed against the WNV genome results in a significant inhibition of WNV replication.",

Geiss, Pierson, and Diamond (2005) observed that siRNAs targeting the C gene had no effect on virus replication when transfected into cells 10 h after WNV infection using lipid-based reagents. In addition, no significant reduction in viral protein or RNA levels was seen in WNV replicon-expressing cells transfected with siRNAs targeting the NS3 gene using lipid-based reagents. On the other hand, however, a 10-fold reduction in NS3 protein expression and a 7.5-fold decrease in RNA levels were observed when the siRNA molecules were delivered to the cell cytoplasm by electroporation. These results indicate that transient opening of membrane structures is required to induce RNAi during active WNV replication. However, a word of caution is in place here as siRNA transfection with oligofectamine, also a lipid-based reagent, was found to reduce HCV protein expression and RNA replication in HCV replicon-expressing cells (Takigawa et al., 2004).",

The virus is predominantly transmitted to humans through the mosquito Aedes aegypti, but Aedes albopictus can act as a vector as well. Four antigenically distinct viruses designated from 1 to 4 (DENV 1\u20134) have been identified so far. Infection with any of the four DENV serotypes can give a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from acute self-limiting febrile illness to life-threatening complications like hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock. Individuals that develop severe disease often have preexisting anti-dengue immunity generated during previous heterologous DENV infections or received anti-dengue antibodies from their mother (Ubol & Halstead, 2010). The immunopathogenesis of severe disease is complex and see references for reviews on this topic (Green and Rothman, 2006, Ubol and Halstead, 2010) In the past few decades, dengue disease has become a major health problem due to increased endemic activity and emergence to previously nonendemic regions (Gould & Solomon, 2008).",

For example, adeno-associated virus vectors carrying siRNA against the CS1 region (a conserved sequence in the 3\u2032UTR of all four DENV serotypes) decreased the percentage of DENV-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) and reduced apoptosis of the infected cells. The observed attenuated but prolonged virus particle production may be beneficial as activation of humoral and cellular immune responses is considered to help with the clearance of DENV particles (Zhang et al., 2004). In addition, Subramanya et al. reported 80% reduction in infection of MDDC when cells were treated with siRNAs targeting E gene after DENV infection (Subramanya et al., 2010). In this study, the authors used a novel peptide-based delivery system that allows targeting of siRNAs to human DCs both in vitro as well as in in vivo models (Subramanya et al., 2010).",

JEV replication was attenuated in BHK-21 and HEK-293T cells transfected with a shRNA targeting the NS5 gene 5 h prior to infection (Liu et al., 2006, Qi et al., 2008). In addition, Kumar and coworkers reported that JEV infection is almost completely abolished in Vero cells and Neuro 2a cells prior transduced with a shRNA directed to the E gene. Importantly, all mice survived JEV infection when treated with shRNA 0.5 or 6 h postchallenge (Kumar, Lee, Shankar, & Manjunath, 2006). The use of several siRNAs to target multiple sites along the genome of JEV has also been reported. Wu et al. constructed a single polycistron to simultaneously express nine siRNAs-targeting eight genes of JEV (PrM, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Transfection of BHK-21 cells with this construct inhibited replication of three wild-type JEV strains belonging to two different genotypes (Wu, Xue, Wang, Du, & Jin, 2011). Furthermore, efficient inhibition of infection was seen using recombinant JEV carrying MREs. Yen et al. inserted two copies of the MRE for miR-124 in the 3\u2032UTR of JEV. None of the mice challenged with this virus died from infection, whereas virus challenged with the wild-type strain or with a virus carrying a mutated MRE was lethal for all mice. Interestingly, immunization with the JEV carrying the MRE for miR-124 elicited protective immunity against subsequent lethal challenge with wild-type JEV (Yen et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The vast majority of mosquitoes become infected with an arbovirus when they take a blood meal from a viremic vertebrate host. Viral amplification begins with the infection of midgut epithelium cells which is followed by dissemination of the virus to the salivary glands and other tissues. Once the virus is present in saliva, a female mosquito transmits the virus to a new host while taking blood meal (Kuno & Chang, 2005). Despite efficient virus replication, minimal pathology is seen in the mosquito vector (Lambrechts & Scott, 2009). This suggests the presence of evolutionary mechanisms that allow virus replication without jeopardizing the host and transmission. Indeed, it has been suggested that RNAi is a key component of the innate immune response of mosquitoes to viral infections (Blair, 2011). In previous sections, we have described that an exogenous trigger of the RNAi pathway in mosquito-cultured cells (Adelman et al., 2001, Adelman et al., 2002, Gaines et al., 1996, Olson et al., 2002) and A. aegypti mosquitoes (Adelman et al., 2001, Adelman et al., 2002, Gaines et al., 1996, Olson et al., 2002) can mediate resistance against flaviviruses. In addition, it has been shown that WNV (Chotkowski et al., 2008) and DENV (Mukherjee & Hanley, 2010) infection (Mukherjee & Hanley, 2010) of Drosophila cell lines induce functional virus-specific siRNAs that promote a protective RNAi response. Although the production of DENV-specific siRNAs has also been reported in Aag2 cells and orally infected A. aegypti mosquitoes, it seems that the virus can somehow circumvent the natural RNAi response, since persistent infection is observed in both cases (Brackney et al., 2010, Sanchez-Vargas et al., 2009). Furthermore, impairment of the RNAi pathway was found to increase viral replication (Brackney et al., 2010, Sanchez-Vargas et al., 2009). Taken together, these observations suggest that the RNAi response in mosquitoes controls virus replication to such an extent that it prevents pathology in the infected host but is sufficiently high to allow transmission of the virus to a new host.",

Female mosquitoes genetically manipulated with germ line transgenes to express dsRNA derived from the prM gene of DENV-2 in their midgets have a high level of resistance toward DENV-2 infection and a reduced ability to transmit the virus (Franz et al., 2006). The resistant phenotype of the transgenic mosquitoes was maintained for 13 generations; however, from G14 it became weaker and eventually it was lost in G17. The loss of resistance was caused by the inhibition of the transgene expression, but the explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear (Franz et al., 2009). As the authors pointed out, considerations in the transgene design\u2014such as the potential risk for the modified mosquitoes and the ability of the transgene to be inherited and expressed\u2014should be taken into account if a strategy of population replacement will be applied in the field.",

In recent years, the naturally occurring interactions between viruses and the host-cellular RNAi pathway have also been highlighted. Viral infections induce profound changes in the miRNA expression profile of the host cell. These changes may represent an additional mechanism of the innate immune response and/or are induced by the virus in order to promote reproduction (Skalsky & Cullen, 2010). There are only a few reports available describing how arthropod-borne flaviviruses influence the miRNA expression of their host cells. Skalsky, Vanlandingham, Scholle, Higgs, and Cullen (2010), observed downregulation of miR-989 and overexpression of miR-92 in Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes infected with WNV when compared to noninfected mosquitoes. Unfortunately, there is no evidence on the functional role of these miRNAs during WNV infection (Skalsky et al., 2010). It has also been reported that WNV induces upregulation of miRNA Hs_154 in infected neuronal cells and in the central nervous system tissue of infected mice. Hs_154 targets the mRNA of the antiapoptotic proteins, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and EGFR-coexpressed protein (ECOP). The authors hypothesize that the upregulation of Hs_154 is a cellular antiviral response to the infection since downregulation of CTCF and ECOP contributes to cell death (Smith, Grey, Uhrlaub, Nikolich-Zugich, & Hirsch, 2012).",

The discovered miRNA (KUN-miR-1) upregulates the mosquito GATA4 mRNA level and promotes replication of the virus (Hussain et al., 2012). Furthermore, as a proof of concept it was shown that functional viral miRNAs can be produced if the pre-miRNA sequence is incorporated into the genome of the virus. For example, TBEV was able to express an Epstein\u2013Barr viral miRNA when the precursor was integrated into the 3\u2032UTR of TBEV genome (Rouha, Thurner, & Mandl, 2010).",

In addition, mRNAs encoding cellular cofactors for viral replication can be targeted to suppress viral replication. However, careful design of the small RNA sequence must be done since partial homology between small RNAs and unintended mRNA transcripts might result in nondesirable gene silencing (Jackson et al., 2006). In addition, if the activation of the innate immune response is not desirable, it is critical to avoid sequences that can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (Robbins, Judge, & MacLachlan, 2009). Moreover, during RNAi silencing of viral replication, escape mutants often arise and therefore targeting of conserved regions is preferable as well as the use of multiple RNA molecules targeting distinct regions (Sugiyama et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2012). Bioinformatic approaches followed up with experimental validation should be applied to determine optimal siRNA sequences that are complementary to the target mRNA, induce minimal immune response, and avoid the appearance of escape mutants. In the case of flaviviruses, highly conserved sequences within the C, NS5 genes and within the 3\u2032UTR might represent excellent targets for RNAi therapies. Furthermore, future research should continue to focus on the complex interplay of arthropod-borne flaviviruses and the RNAi pathway in different host cells to search for novel targets for RNAi-based intervention.",

The most commonly applied delivery systems to date are lipid-based carriers, antibodies, peptides, and nanoparticles conjugates (Shim & Kwon, 2010). Recently, a clinical trial with patients having solid cancers showed inhibition of gene expression using siRNA-targeted nanoparticles that were administered systemically (Davis et al., 2010). This technology was also found effective in a cell culture model of HCV infection (Chandra et al., 2012). Alternatively, as was mentioned above, Subramanya and coworkers successfully linked an siRNA molecule to a peptide able to bind specifically to human MDDC, one of the main targets of DENV (Subramanya et al., 2010).
