Moreover, many complications in adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and pulmonary embolisms, may be misinterpreted as respiratory infections due to the lack of specificity of certain diagnostic criteria such as chest X-ray [5]. Previous reports have highlighted the poor correlation between clinical diagnosis of VAP and the histopathology findings [6, 7]. All these limitations have implications for clinical practice, surveillance initiatives, and the design of preventive strategies [8].",

The exclusion criteria were mechanical ventilation for less than 48 h, age below 18, and presence of respiratory viral infection. Only the first episode of VAE in each patient was included in the study. Subjects with incomplete follow-up data were eliminated. Extubation, ICU discharge, or death in the ICU were recorded as outcome end-points. The following characteristics were recorded: age, sex, weight, APACHE II score [12], immunosuppressive therapy, reason for and site of intubation, hospital and ICU LOS, implementation of preventive measures for ventilator-associated respiratory infections (VARI), clinical and laboratory parameters of inflammatory response [13], microbiological data, use of antibiotics, sedation and medical paralysis, fluid balance, and need for tracheostomy during the ICU stay. Daily follow-up data were recorded in a collaborative web database (http://compartint.net/euvae/). The current adult definitions for VAEs implemented in the CDC 2013 National Healthcare Safety Network and its 2015 update [3, 14] were assessed (Table 1). There are three definition tiers within the VAE algorithm: (1) VAE, (2) IVAC, and (3) PVAP (Fig. 1). Cases of VAP or ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) were recorded according to the 2008 CDC criteria [15]. In brief, VAP was defined as the presence of a new or progressive and persistent pulmonary infiltrate, consolidation, or cavitation plus at least three of the following in a patient under mechanical ventilation for > 48 h: (1) temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C or \u2264 36 \u00b0C with no other recognized cause; (2) leukocyte count \u2265 12,000/mm3 or < 4000/mm3; (3) new onset of purulent tracheal secretions or change in character of sputum, or increased respiratory secretions, or increased suctioning requirements; (4) new-onset or worsening dyspnea or tachypnea; (5) wheezing, rales, or bronchial breath sounds; (6) worsening gas exchange, increased oxygen requirement, or increased ventilator demand; (7) altered mental status in a patient > 70 years old. The definition of VAT [16, 17] was based on the absence of clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia and presence of the following criteria: positive culture obtained by deep tracheal aspirate plus at least two of these signs in a patient under mechanical ventilation for > 48 h: fever > 38 \u00b0C, new or increased purulent tracheal secretions, rhonchi, or wheezing (Table 1). Quantitative definitions of significant growth in cultures and purulent respiratory secretions are detailed in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) appendixes 2 and 3. Atelectasis was defined as collapse of a part of the lung due to a decrease in the amount of air in the alveoli, resulting in volume loss and increased density. Pulmonary edema was diagnosed based on air space opacification in a classic batwing distribution, possibly accompanied by air bronchograms, with peribronchial cuffing and perihilar haze, septal lines (Kerley lines), and thickening of interlobar fissures. The final diagnosis was established by the investigator based on the radiologist\u2019s interpretation. In unclear cases, lung ultrasound was performed to differentiate opacities [18]. An episode of mechanical ventilation was defined as the period between tracheal intubation (day 1) and 24 h after successful extubation (or disconnection from the ventilator in the case of tracheotomized patients).\n",

            "text": "Our findings are consistent with the results of a recent meta-analysis by Fan and colleagues [20] in demonstrating that VAE were associated with increased mortality, more days of mechanical ventilation, and greater hospital LOS than traditional VAP criteria. Worsening in FiO2 and in PEEP are commonly used in clinical practice as surrogates of poor oxygenation [21\u201323], and both are employed by the VAE definition to detect deterioration in oxygenation. Several studies have reported notable reductions in the time taken to detect VAE when automatic surveillance was used [24, 25]. Not surprisingly, the association between poor oxygenation and outcomes in patients with VAP has previously been reported [21, 22]. In 2012, Klompas et al [23] evaluated the feasibility of 32 possible surveillance definitions for VAP, reporting that only those including quantitative evidence of respiratory deterioration were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the same way, the VAE paradigm broadens the spectrum of complications associated with mechanical ventilation, identifying conditions severe enough to cause respiratory worsening, including respiratory infection-related events such as VAP as well as tracheobronchitis and non-infective and extra-pulmonary events. PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the presence of infection, and the level of PEEP [23, 26\u201328] enhanced the power of VAE surveillance. In our cohort, PVAP was the most frequent complication but non-negligible incidences of atelectasis, ARDS, and pulmonary edema were also documented. Similar results have been reported elsewhere [20, 29, 30], and there is growing evidence that many of these events are preventable [14, 31, 32]. In our study, only 59% of patients with suspicion of pulmonary infection had PVAP and almost 39% of cases were due to a noninfectious event (atelectasis, ARDS, pulmonary edema). In the pediatric population, the presence of VAE was also associated with worse outcomes, including mortality; however, IVAC was less prevalent than in adults. Indeed, the incidence of ARDS and pulmonary edema was lower, while atelectasis was the most frequent event [33, 34]. This confirms that the newer VAE classification moves the focus beyond respiratory infections but selects only the most severe cases.",

Selection bias is a potential important concern, and due to the heterogeneity of the ICUs\u2019 case mix it might affect generalization. Owing to the high proportion of university hospitals, some of the results might not be globally representative, while the exclusion of children, chronically ill patients, and patients ventilated outside the ICU may limit the extrapolation of the results to other settings. Our cohort presented a lower VAC rate than those reported in previous studies [35, 37], possibly due to differences in institutional antibiotic policies and practices between hospitals. Klompas [38] reported high interobserver variability in diagnosis of respiratory infections, and several studies reported differences in surveillance practice across hospitals [15, 39]; however, these differences could be used to identify variables as independent factors. Finally, given the low incidence of some of the events, the power to demonstrate statistical differences is sometimes limited by small cohort size.",
