Both are also common parasites of humans and wildlife. An important aspect of the epidemiology of infections with both parasites is to understand the host range of different species and strains/genotypes, how they are maintained in nature, and the potential for cross-transmission. This is particularly important in determining the zoonotic potential of Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections in domestic animals.",

With both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, a large number of species and genotypes are now recognised that differ principally in their host range. Some species and genotypes appear to be restricted to particular species or types of hosts (e.g. Giardia psittaci and Cryptosporidium baileyi in birds; Cryptosporidium canis in dogs; Giardia assemblage E [Giardia bovis] in livestock; Table 1), whereas others have broad host ranges, including humans (e.g. Giardia duodenalis; and Cryptosporidium parvum; Table 1), and are therefore of zoonotic significance. In addition to C. parvum, several other species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium have occasionally been recorded in humans, but usually in paediatric cases associated with immunosuppressive disorders or other factors that may predispose to lowering host resistance (Thompson et al., 2005).",

Cysts and oocysts remain infectious for months in cool, damp areas and rapidly accumulate in environments, such as refuges, kennels, catteries and dairies. They can also survive in water for considerable periods. The host ingests the cyst/oocyst stage of the parasite and, following exposure to gastric acid, gastric and pancreatic enzymes, excystation occurs in the duodenum and the trophozoites/sporozoites are released. The life cycles of each parasite include asexual phases of proliferation on the brush border villous epithelium of the mucosal surface, in addition to a sexual phase of reproduction in Cryptosporidium that also exhibits an unusual intracellular phase of development in its life cycle (Thompson et al., 2005).",

It has been known for some time that dogs can harbour infections of either zoonotic or host-specific assemblages of Giardia (Caccio et al., 2005), and this has been demonstrated in a number of recent studies in urban areas of Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Italy and Poland (Berrilli et al., 2004, Itagaki et al., 2005, Lalle et al., 2005, Eligio-Garcia et al., 2005, Zygner et al., 2006, Volot\u00e3o et al., 2007). The most recent report from Germany found that of 60 Giardia positive samples collected randomly from dogs in urban areas, 60% were infected with zoonotic Giardia from assemblage A, 12% with dog-specific assemblages C and D, and the remaining 28% harboured mixed infections (Leonhard et al., 2007). Few studies have been undertaken in cats, but Vasilopulos et al. (2007) examined 250 cats from Mississippi and Alabama, USA, and of 17 positive for Giardia, found six infected with Assemblage A-I and 11 with Assemblage F (the cat genotype). As such, the finding of Giardia in the faeces of companion animals is justification for treatment.",

In the former, recent research in localised endemic foci of transmission have provided evidence in support of the role of dogs in cycles of zoonotic Giardia transmission involving humans and domestic dogs from communities in tea growing areas of Assam, India, and in temple communities in Bangkok, Thailand (Traub et al., 2004, Inpankaew et al., 2007).

Thus dogs and cats, and possibly other companion animals, may not be important zoonotic reservoirs of Cryptosporidium infection. However, with Cryptosporidium, there is considerable epidemiological data demonstrating strong links between contact with infected livestock and human infections (Fayer et al., 2000, Stantic-Pavlinic et al., 2003). This is not the case with Giardia, but with both organisms, infected livestock have long been incriminated as sources for the waterborne transmission of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis (Fayer et al., 2000, Thompson, 2004). Interestingly, the application of genotyping procedures to the contaminating isolate(s) has often incriminated human effluent as the source (Thompson, 2004, Hunter and Thompson, 2005). However, in a study undertaken of cryptosporidiosis patients in Scotland, C. parvum was shown to be the causative agent in 84% of 67 cases, supporting livestock faecal pollution of water sources as the leading cause of human sporadic cryptosporidiosis (Goh et al., 2004).",

The importance of giardiasis as a cause of diarrhoea in ruminants is unclear, especially given that diarrhoea in ruminants is often multifactorial with more than one pathogen detected (O\u2019Handley and Olson, 2006). Nevertheless, the significance of Giardia infection in ruminants warrants further investigation, particularly with regard to production loss. Production parameters were carefully examined in bottle-fed specific pathogen-free (SPF) lambs experimentally infected with Giardia; infection was shown to be associated with extended times for lambs to reach slaughter weight and decreased carcass weight (Olson et al., 1995).",

Concentration of faecal samples using saturated sugar is recommended particularly for livestock samples.

Barr et al. (1993b) demonstrated that albendazole was effective for treating giardiasis in dogs, however, in another study albendazole caused bone marrow suppression (Stokol et al., 1997) and was ineffective for the treatment of giardiasis in a small group of cats (Barr et al., 1993a). Oxfendazole given orally was tested experimentally at a single and double dose (11.3 and 22.6 mg/kg, respectively) and proved very effective in removing Giardia from dogs with no signs of toxicity (Villeneuve et al., 2000).",

Halofuginone lactate (Halocur, Intervet) has been used as an anticoccidial agent in poultry and has recently been registered in Europe as a chemotherapeutic agent for cryptosporidiosis in domestic cattle. Halofuginone has a cryptosporidiostatic effect on sporozoite and merozoite stages of the parasite. It has been shown to reduce incidence and severity of diarrhoea, but does not prevent oocyst shedding (Villacorta et al., 1991, Joachim, 2003).

Vaccines have been shown to reduce clinical signs, but in most cases have not eliminated or reduced oocyst shedding. As calves, lambs and goats are infected with Cryptosporidium spp. during the first or second week of life, passive immune protection by vaccination of dams is the approach for these species (Harp and Goff, 1998). Colostrum containing a high concentration of immunoglobulin G antibodies to Cryptosporidium (hyperimmune colostrum) has been reported to reduce diarrhoea and oocyst shedding in calves and lambs (Harp et al., 1989; Fayer et al., 1998; Naciri et al., 1994).

As such, we are in a much better position to evaluate risk factors for public health from infections in companion animals and livestock. The public health significance of infections in domestic animals does not appear to be as great as previously thought, yet there is a need to undertake molecular epidemiological studies in localised, well defined endemic foci, particularly in developing countries and among disadvantaged groups. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infections with Giardia and Cryptosporidium has improved and we are closer to being able to answer why clinical disease occurs in some individuals, but may not be apparent in others. Drugs are available to treat infections with Giardia but the question is when to use them. There are no effective drugs to treat cryptosporidial infections, highlighting the atypical features of this parasite. The prospects for vaccines against both organisms seem a long way off, but there would be clear value for their use in livestock.",
