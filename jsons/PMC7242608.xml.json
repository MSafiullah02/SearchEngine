However, during this unprecedented reduction in elective joint arthroplasty, there is likely to be some controversy as to what constitutes a purely \u201celective\u201d procedure, versus an \u201curgent\u201d or \u201cemergent\u201d procedure, depending on the indication for surgery and the clinical condition of the patient, particularly in the setting of total hip arthroplasty. The purpose of the present article is therefore to review some of the most commonly encountered indications for primary, conversion, and revision hip arthroplasty and discuss the available evidence for what may reasonably be considered an urgent versus elective procedure, specifically in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors further present their current algorithm for determining the urgency of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and present a case series of relevant THA patients as examples.",

Elective procedures are defined as \u201cthose with chronic problems whose surgery can certainly be delayed without significant harm to the patient or eventual outcome.\u201d Generally, uncomplicated THA falls within this description, and thus a delay in elective THA is recommended until the COVID-19 pandemic begins to subside. Chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis, non-erosive rheumatoid arthritis, non-collapsed avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, chronic sequelae of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), and chronic femoral acetabular impingement (FAI) with osteoarthritis are generally not treated urgently, and a short delay in care during the several weeks to months of the COVID-19 pandemic would not be expected to result in significant harm to the patient [13\u201317]. For example, Nilsdotter et al. have found that SF-36 and WOMAC scores did not differ between patients with stable primary OA who waited more than 3 months for their THA compared to those that underwent THA immediately [13]. Similarly, non-urgent conversion THA indications, such as previous fracture constructs that have gone to develop stable osteoarthritis, can likely be considered elective surgery on the basis of the above criteria [18]. Such patients should be encouraged to attempt additional conservative treatment measures including anti-inflammatory medication, injections, application of ice/heat, stretching, low impact exercises, and weight loss [19].",

Femoral neck fractures should therefore continue to be treated urgently with either hemiarthroplasty or THA, depending on the patient\u2019s age and baseline activity level [20\u201323]. The morbidity and mortality secondary to hip fractures are well recognized in the literature, with mortality rates in the elderly ranging between 14 and 36% within 1 year of the injury [24\u201332]. Additionally, Klestil et al. have investigated the threshold to which a delay in hip fracture surgery would result in worsened outcome. The authors found that in elderly patients sustaining hip fractures, early surgery was associated with reduced perioperative complications, as well as reduced mortality [33]. Furthermore, patients that had surgery within the first 48 h after injury had a 20% lower 1-year mortality [33]. These data would suggest that hip fracture and similar diagnoses should warrant urgent intervention despite restrictions on arthroplasty surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition, progressive structural bone erosion of either the proximal femur or acetabulum, as may occur in AVN, tumor, rheumatoid arthritis, or other metabolic processes, may cause increased morbidity for the patient and/or necessitate a more extensive surgical reconstruction if delayed, and urgent THA may be advisable in these patients [34\u201336].",

For example, failed internal fixation of hip fractures, such as nonunion and/or collapse of the fracture construct, ultimately leads to profound functional disability and pain for an already fragile patient population [18, 37\u201340]. Such patients can be more functionally comparable to fracture patients and may need evaluation on a more urgent basis. Particularly in a patient with intractable pain and disability, conversion THA due to nonunion or collapse of a previous fracture construct (such as percutaneous screw fixation, compression hip screw, or cephalomedullary nail) could merit urgent intervention if functionally similar to a patient presenting with a hip fracture [18, 37\u201340].",

The resulting loss of function from osteoarthritis and other painful hip syndromes leads to a cyclical feedback loop of diminished physical activity, reduced muscular function, increased obesity, worsened medical comorbidities, and the development of psychological factors relating to the pain and dysfunction [41]. Chronic immobility in this setting may also put the patient at elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pneumonia [42]. Compared to the general population, patients who are chronically immobile are at a significantly increased risk for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, deep vein thrombosis, and all-cause mortality [42\u201344]. Furthermore, patients with osteoarthritis are at increased risk of falling, with 50% of OA patients self-reporting a fall every year [45\u201347]. Therefore, the risks of clinical deterioration, immobility, and frequent falls should be considered when determining the level of urgency for an individual patient. Adequate documentation of the patient\u2019s clinical condition is crucial in this regard, and ultimately, it is the patient\u2019s orthopedic surgeon in conjunction with the treating facility that may determine the level of urgency and indication for proceeding with THA in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Stable, chronic problems in which surgery can certainly be delayed without significant harm to the patient or eventual outcome should be delayed in the setting of COVID-19 pandemic. For example, elective head/liner exchange for polyethylene wear in a minimally symptomatic patient with minimal osteolysis may be reasonably delayed without causing additional patient morbidity [48]. Similarly, one- or both-component revisions for suspected aseptic loosening in a stable patient without progressive bone loss may be potentially delayed during the pandemic without resulting in additional harm to the patient [48, 49]. Consistent with the conservative modalities for primary THA candidates, non-operative treatments including anti-inflammatory medication, application of ice/heat, stretching, low impact exercises, and weight loss may be indicated while these patients await surgery [19].",

Periprosthetic hip infections remain a major complication of total hip arthroplasty in the USA [50\u201353]. Deep periprosthetic hip infection is associated with a mortality rate of 5.5\u20138% at 1 year, and delay in treatment may result in additional morbidity for the patient [52\u201354]. Additionally, the differentiation between an acute vs chronic periprosthetic joint infection is time-sensitive; to delay surgery in the setting of an acute infection may mean the difference between a successful irrigation and debridement with implant retention, versus the need for a considerably more morbid two-stage revision [55, 56]. Additional urgent indications for revision THA may include an irreducible prosthetic dislocation or a periprosthetic fracture; in such cases delay of treatment could confer significant additional morbidity to the patient, and urgent revision THA may be preferred despite the current COVID-19 restrictions [57].",

Additionally, loose implants that are eroding the patient\u2019s bone stock similarly may result in additional patient harm if not addressed early, and progressive loss of bone stock may require a more complicated reconstruction with potentially more patient morbidity.

Once a patient has been determined to be a candidate for arthroplasty surgery, the next step is to consider whether a short postponement of several weeks could potentially result in significant harm to the patient. If the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d then it is recommended that surgery be delayed. Obviously, urgent scenarios such as fractures or infections are recommended to proceed without delay.",

Her right hip was initially more severe both clinically and radiographically, and she underwent elective right total hip replacement prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the setting of the COVID-19 elective surgery restrictions, she re-presented to our arthroplasty service with rapid deterioration and intractable pain of the left hip over the previous few weeks. She stated she could not safely transition from a sitting to standing position. Despite attempted use of the walker, she was unable to ambulate, felt unstable on her left side, and stated she was acutely afraid of falling and causing additional injury. She was essentially bedridden due to this clinical deterioration. Radiographic analysis of the left hip demonstrated interval progression of AVN, with collapse of the articulating surface of the femoral head. The collapsed femoral head was now eroding superolaterally through the acetabulum, creating a superolateral rim defect (Fig. 2). Importantly, the patient had no previous medical history that would confer significantly increased risk in the setting of COVID-19, such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, or chronic lung disease.",

Per the patient\u2019s daughter, her clinical condition had deteriorated particularly over the previous 2 weeks, with multiple episodes of stumbling and tripping due to the worsening hip pain and inability to bear weight on the left side. The patient stated that night-time was particularly dangerous for her, as she had extreme difficulty with toileting due to the pain and dysfunction in her left hip, and was fearful that she may injure herself in a fall. By the time of presentation, the patient reported she was essentially confined to bed due to her deteriorating clinical status. Plain radiographs demonstrated the previous percutaneous fixation of the patient\u2019s subcapital femoral neck fracture with three cannulated screws. However, the fracture construct was seen to have collapsed into nonunion, with a persistently visible fracture line and shortening of the femoral neck, with resulting partial backing-out of the screws laterally (Fig. 3).",

Finally, the authors recognize that the decision to proceed with urgent hip arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic must also be weighed in the context of the region or city in which the surgery is being performed.
