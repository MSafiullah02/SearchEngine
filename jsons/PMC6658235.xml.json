There is a need for new biomarkers that better distinguish viral infections from antibiotic-requiring bacterial infections in children presenting with clinical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and that assist health care workers in decision making and improving the rational use of antibiotics [5].",

There is increasing evidence that PCT is superior to CRP as a screening test for serious bacterial infection given the favorable kinetics, including a more rapid response to inflammation [8]. However, neither of the biomarkers have been proven to be reliable in differentiating between mild or moderate bacterial and viral CAP [9,10]. A WBC count of 15,000/\u03bcl has been suggested as a cutoff to differentiate between viral and bacterial etiologies. However, critically ill patients with neutropenia will not have an increased WBC count, and certain viruses such as influenza and adenovirus can elicit a strong immune response with a high WBC count greater than 15,000/\u03bcl [11]. Neither is a complete blood count reliable in differentiating between bacterial and viral CAP in children [6]. To date, most biomarkers used in clinical practice have been selected for their ability to identify serious bacterial infections, and there is a need for novel biomarkers that can reliably detect viral infections [12].",

Increased blood MxA has been reported to be specific for viral infection [13-15]. There is a commercially available rapid diagnostic test, FebriDx, that qualitatively detects MxA and CRP at cutoffs of 40 ng/ml and 20 mg/ml, respectively. The test has been reported to have 85% (29/34) sensitivity and 93.4% (183/196) specificity to rule out a bacterial infection in patients (adults and children) with febrile respiratory infection [16]. However, no studies have focused on MxA in children with CAP. It was previously shown that virus-positive asymptomatic children had lower MxA levels as compared with virus-positive symptomatic children with respiratory symptoms [14]. As current viral real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of upper respiratory specimens (ie, the routine method for diagnosing respiratory tract infections) is complicated by frequent asymptomatic detection, MxA has the potential to facilitate the interpretation of viral PCR positivity in terms of clinical relevance in children with CAP [17].",

            "text": "Defining etiology in childhood CAP is complex [18]. Until recently, our conception of CAP etiology has largely relied on early lung-aspirate studies from the 1970s to 1980s [19]. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B, the 2 major causative agents in childhood CAP, has been introduced in most parts of the world during the last two decades, coinciding with a global decrease in childhood CAP mortality [20]. This has also contributed to a shift in the etiology of CAP [21,22]. Other important factors include a globally improved socioeconomic and nutritional status, a sharp decrease in the incidence of measles, and the emergence of HIV [5]. Recently, new CAP etiology studies, including the large-scale Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, have been conducted, mostly with a low-income country focus [21-24]. These have pointed toward an underestimation of viral and mixed viral-bacterial etiologies, which is likely explained by the aforementioned shift in etiology but also by the recent advances in viral diagnostics [25]. Moreover, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis, the causative agents of whooping cough, have been associated with CAP [21,26]. These bacteria are highly contagious and can cause severe disease, particularly in infants [27]. Recent studies have reported an increasing incidence of B pertussis, and there have been several deaths in previously healthy infants associated with whooping cough in Sweden over the last 10 years [28,29]. Consequently, there is a need for new updated studies on CAP etiology in various settings.",

However, there are several new antivirals that are being developed [30], and furthermore, there is a value in diagnosing viral infections to predict the clinical course and infectivity and to give confidence to withhold the prescription of antibiotics. Real-time PCR is a sensitive molecular-based method that is currently considered gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses in children with respiratory tract infection [25]. Nevertheless, as PCR usually has to be run in central laboratories and requires complex instrumentation, the turnaround time can be long and the test results are rarely used for decision making regarding treatment at the point of care. There are currently several new antigen-based point-of-care tests for respiratory infections on the market. One is the multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system (mariPOC) respi, ArcDia International Oy Ltd, that uses a 2-photon excitation assay technique to detect 10 different respiratory viruses (influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], and parainfluenza virus [PIV] 1-3) [31]. The advantage of the test is that it gives a preliminary result of strongly positive samples already after 20 min and a final result (including negative results) within 2 hours, which potentially allows for immediate treatment considerations. In children, the mariPOC respi\u2019s sensitivity for RSV and influenza virus has been reported to be as high as 90% as compared with PCR, but the sensitivity for less common respiratory viruses, such as hMPV and PIV, and the newly included coronavirus and bocavirus has been insufficiently investigated [32,33].",

For the sample size calculation, we focused on the assessment of MxA levels in cases with viral CAP as compared with cases with bacterial CAP/controls (study I). Overall, 2 power calculations were made, 1 for viral CAP versus bacterial CAP and 1 for viral CAP versus controls. The following assumptions were made: (1) A difference in MxA level of 500 \u00b5g/l between the groups was considered clinically relevant. (2) A standard deviation of 1000 and 300 was assumed in cases with viral CAP and bacterial CAP/controls, respectively, based on previous studies on MxA [13,14]. Using an alpha level of .05 (2 sided) at an 80% power, with an additional 20% to account for nonparametric testing and multivariate analyses, 42 children in each group (viral CAP, bacterial CAP, and controls) would be needed. To ensure that enough of the included cases would fulfill the study definitions for viral and bacterial CAP, the proportion of children with viral and bacterial CAP (TREND definition) was calculated in our previous study that assessed Swedish children with x-ray\u2013verified CAP [47]. By doing this, the prevalence of viral and bacterial CAP was estimated at 45% and 14%, respectively. Hence, 300 cases and 42 controls would be needed to ensure sufficient collection of cases with viral and bacterial CAP, respectively. We also would like to compare viral CAP cases with controls testing positive for 1 or more viruses by PCR. In our previous study, 35.4% of asymptomatic children tested positive for 1 or more viruses. Hence, to include a sufficient number of virus-positive controls, we aim at including 300 cases and 120 controls in the TREND study.",

The TREND study aims to add further information on the role of MxA as a marker to improve the interpretation of viral PCR positivity and to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections with a specific focus on children with CAP.

            "text": "One major weakness in the studies of diagnostic biomarkers in pediatric infectious diseases is the lack of a reliable gold standard for the microbiological diagnosis [5,49]. The gold standard for assigning bacterial etiology has traditionally been the detection of bacteria in cultures from normally sterile sites (lung, blood, and pleura). However, as sampling from the lung/pleura is infeasible in most cases and blood cultures have limited sensitivity, this approach is of little use in clinical studies of CAP [5]. Previous studies assessing the performance of diagnostic tests in terms of distinguishing bacterial infections from viral infections have used either an independent expert panel or a laboratory-/radiological-based approach to classify disease etiology [12-15]. Both approaches have their advantages and limitations. Using a strict microbiologically confirmed diagnosis as the reference has the advantage of high specificity, but the generalizability of the findings is hampered as the majority of children in clinical practice will not have a clear microbiologically confirmed diagnosis. In addition, for a diagnostic test to be useful, it is more important to distinguish between etiologically less clear cases of respiratory infections rather than to identify the school book examples of bacterial and viral infections. In the TREND study, we chose a more pragmatic approach favoring generalizability for microbiological accuracy. However, given that doctors in expert panels rely on microbiological and biochemical findings, we reasoned that it still would be more stringent to create an algorithm for the classification of etiology. In the TREND study, a diagnostic algorithm has been created a priori to serve as the reference based on the current evidence for the classification of CAP etiology. Detection of RSV, hMPV, influenza virus, and PIV has, in previous case-control studies, been highly associated with CAP. Furthermore, these viruses appear to be rarely detected in asymptomatic individuals, and hence, detection will be considered to be a definitive indicator of etiology [21,22,47,50,51]. For other respiratory viruses as well as for the atypical bacteria M pneumoniae, the clinical significance of PCR positivity is less clear owing to frequent detections in asymptomatic children [17,52-55]. For that reason, PCR positivity will not be considered enough for establishing etiology. Virkki et al reported that a CRP level of more than 80 in children aged less than or equal to 2 years and more than 120 in children aged 2 to 5 years was specific (>85%) for bacterial etiology, whereas a CRP level of less than 20 was specific for viral etiology (78%) [56]. These cutoffs will be used to aid in the definition of probable bacterial and viral infections in less clear cases. Hence, detection of viruses other than influenza, RSV, hMPV, and PIV will be considered as viral infections only if the CRP value is less than 20. Given that adenovirus has been associated with high CRP, this rule will not be applicable for adenovirus [11]. However, adenovirus detections will not be considered in the strict algorithm, as asymptomatic detection of the virus is common [17]. Finally, given that CRP levels depend on the disease duration and to avoid false-negative test results (ie, low but rising CRP values), an additional criterion of reported fever duration of more than 24 hours will be applied in the TREND study when considering CRP levels [45]. As discussed above, there is no optimal reference standard for the classification of CAP etiology, neither clinically nor in research. However, we believe that much is to be gained if we use an algorithm instead of an expert panel. The decisions taken by expert panels differ between different studies, over time, and between different settings. When using an algorithm, this can be controlled for. We look forward to comments and inputs on our algorithm so that together we can develop it further.",

High patient flows and long waiting times create a stressful environment for all personnel categories. Motivating nurses/doctors to spend the extra time and effort it takes to recruit patients is, therefore, challenging. Continuous education/information about the research project, interpersonnel teamwork (nurse and doctor), and incentives are all key success factors. Recruitment of healthy controls in this age group is an obvious challenge as the sampling (blood and nasopharyngeal sampling) causes discomfort to the child. Therefore, attempts have been made to include patients who will undergo elective hand surgery (and thereby be sedated during the sampling). Certain clinical parameters can be deceptive if not recorded correctly, which is a potential source of bias. In children where peripheral oxygen saturation and heart rate are measured continuously, data will still only be recorded at certain time points when the children are at rest.",

However, given the complexity of the host immune response elicited by respiratory pathogens, it is possible that a single biomarker will not be sufficient to accurately differentiate between viral and bacterial CAP. However, MxA could be valuable in a rapid combination test of biomarkers and selected microbiological testing if it proves to be specific for viral CAP. Such commercial combination point-of-care tests of inflammatory biomarkers are already being developed and some, such as FebriDx and MeMed BV, have shown promise [15,60].",
