Healthcare professionals may remain unaware of their COVID-19 status due to the mild or even asymptomatic course in healthy individuals; thus, they may unknowingly become supervectors. [6] [7] [8] 10 Healthcare settings are usually inadequately prepared for infection prevention and control, especially in the context of limited resources (eg, personal protective equipment), and professionals may become infected through their contact with even seemingly noninfected patients. In addition to previously reported measures, alternative distribution of working schedules may contribute to minimizing the likelihood of virus transmission.",

Such a redistribution of shifts makes it possible to resolve the nature of possible infective exposure because the COVID-19 infection window seems to be 48 hours (ie, patients become contagious 48 hours before the onset of symptoms). If a healthcare professional comes into close contact with a patient who later develops symptoms, it is prudent to automatically prolong the self-isolation period until the COVID-19 status of that patient is resolved, allowing enough time to contain possible events of disease transmission. Such a redistribution of working hours, together with rigorous tracking of any relevant close contacts (which could be assisted by novel technologies) limits possible introduction and spread of infection within the institution.",

When measures of self-isolation and/or quarantine are in place and local disease transmission has been demonstrated, clinical spread of infection will become the most important. Furthermore, since healthcare professionals among the few persons allowed free movement under \"stay at home\" orders, this scheduling strategy may have important repercussions for the entire community because it can limit the potential pandemic vector effect, which not yet well understood. 2, 6, 10 This scheduling approach may be feasible in institutions with sufficient staff to maintain a work schedule of continuous rotation, which may be difficult, but it may prove useful in the long run. Additionally, through alternative methods of care delivery, like those provided through novel digital technologies, staff that are not physically present may remain fully involved in providing care for those who need it most. Finally, this scheduling approach may preserve the bulk of physically and mentally healthy staff sorely needed to combat later effects of pandemic, which will have dire consequences for healthcare systems that have not made every effort to prevent intrainstitutional transmission.",
