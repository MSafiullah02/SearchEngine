            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is capable of causing acute respiratory infection, although its spectrum ranges from asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed cases to mild infection to life-threatening disease with a high case fatality rate [1], [2]. MERS-CoV was first described in 2012 in a 60-year-old man hospitalized with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, who developed renal and respiratory failure, ultimately succumbing to progressive disease [3]. The first reported healthcare-associated MERS-CoV infection was described among multiple facilities in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia [4]. However, a later retrospective analysis of a respiratory outbreak in a public hospital in Jordan determined that this cluster dated back earlier, becoming the first recognized healthcare-associated MERS-CoV infection in April 2012 [5]. The disease has also been recognized in many countries with secondary transmissions. The first case of MERS-CoV infection in France caused one secondary transmission among 123 contacts [6]. In a study of 51 outbreaks, nosocomial transmissions were observed in 80.4% of clusters [7]. Another study found that 37.5% of 1797 cases were ascribed to healthcare-associated infections [8]. The percentage of healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in different outbreaks is variable, and ranges between 14% and 64% [9]. The risk of severe disease seems to be higher in people with comorbid diseases and older patients [8].",

This is likely due to the relatively low reproduction number of MERS-CoV of 0.8\u20131.3 [29], [30]. The South Korean MERS outbreak was thought to have a reproduction number of 1% [31]. However, the reproduction number was estimated to be as high as 2\u20135% in some MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [32]. The upper reproduction estimates were probably derived from lack of sufficient infection control measures, and the estimates were lowered with improved detection and prevention practices over time. This review focuses on the available literature on healthcare-associated infections and transmission of MERS-CoV to elucidate the contributing risk factors.",

In this outbreak, multiple infection control issues were observed and included: absence of physical barriers between different beds in intensive care units apart from cloth drapes, lack of isolation and negative pressure rooms, and non-adherence to infection control measures [15]. Patients were transferred to two other hospitals with no further evidence of intrahospital transmission, believed to be due to adequate infection control measures in the accepting institutions [15].",

The index patient had been in contact with 742 people between 11th and 20th May 2015 in one hospital, subsequently infecting 28 patients [35]. A total of 186 MERS-CoV cases were identified in more than 17 healthcare settings [31], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Among the contributory reasons for MERS-CoV advancing within South Korea were HCWs unfamiliarity with MERS, suboptimal infection prevention and control measures, overcrowded emergency departments, multi-bed hospital rooms, \u2018medical shopping\u2019 by patients, visitors to infected patients, extensive MERS patient movements, and the use of aerosol-generating procedures [40], [41], [42]. Particularly problematic factors in the South Korea outbreak were contributions of overcrowding, medical shopping and super-spreaders [1], [34], [35], [40], [43], [44]. The first case in the Republic of Korea infected 27 secondary cases; one secondary patient infected 24 tertiary cases, and another secondary patient infected 73 tertiary cases [34]. Another report from South Korea found 85, 28, 23, 11 and six secondary cases arising from individual patients with MERS-CoV [40]. A secondary patient was described causing 91 tertiary MERS cases, of which 39% occurred within the emergency department and 13% were HCWs [44]. Delayed isolation of suspected patients was an important factor that contributed to the spread of MERS-CoV. This was higher in super-spreaders compared with other patients (mean 6.6 vs 2.9 days; P = 0.061) [45]. Multi-bedded rooms and nebulization treatments may also have contributed to the spread of MERS-CoV in South Korea [46].",

In the recent update from September 2012 to July 2017, there were 2040 cases with healthcare-associated infections (40 HCWs, patients and visitors), representing 31% of cases [10]. The initial symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific, often thought to be pedestrian respiratory infections, and thus may go unnoticed. Adherence to standard precautions at all times, given the unpredictability of MERS-CoV infection, appears to be the critical factor for the prevention of transmission in healthcare facilities [10]. Additionally, environmental contamination may play a role in some transmission of MERS, as viral RNA has been detected for up to five days on surfaces [36].",

A well-characterized outbreak in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates offers insights into important infection control issues. The overwhelming reason for MERS-CoV spread centred on the delayed diagnosis of MERS-CoV, as 93% of infected contacts were exposed before the patient's diagnosis. Also, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during care was inconsistent among these HCWs, especially during aerosol-generating procedures. Although improved PPE use would be of benefit, a larger preventative impact would be to place patients presenting with respiratory complaints and potential MERS-CoV infection in proper isolation with infection control practices until MERS-CoV infection is ruled out using the standard PCR diagnostic method.",

Proper triaging of patients with acute respiratory illness is a fundamental step towards the application of a unified process to deal with such patients, as suggested by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [50], [51]. Despite such advice, not all healthcare systems in regions endemic for MERS-CoV or in non-endemic regions caring for a potentially infected traveller follow these steps. In a simulation of a \u2018mystery\u2019 infectious patient, 95 drills including 42 drills specifically for patients with possible MERS were conducted in 49 emergency departments in New York, USA. Hospitals were variable in the identification of potentially infectious patients and implementation of appropriate infection control measures, such as suboptimal adherence to hand hygiene, PPE use and isolation signage posting [52].",

Also, the Saudi Ministry of Health has developed a rapid response team that visits hospitals upon the identification of any positive MERS cases to help streamline contact tracing and implementation of infection control measures [54]. A similar rapid response team was also formed following the MERS outbreak in South Korea [55]. An interesting observation of the outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection is the variability in intrahospital transmission of the virus. The South Korea and Jeddah outbreaks witnessed patients causing significant spread of secondary cases, while in other outbreaks, the index patient resulted in few secondary cases despite lack of infection control practices [1]. One reason may lie with prolonged viral shedding, observed more commonly in patients with multiple comorbidities [1]. One study found that 30% of contacts and 76% of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR 12 days after initial positive samples [56]. A case report showed that a HCW shed MERS-COV for approximately 42 days after initial sampling for diagnosis [57]. Whether viral detection by molecular methods always equates to an infectious risk remains unclear. An additional factor likely rests in patient movements. Intra- and interhospital transmission were documented arising from patient movements within and between hospitals [4]\n[42], [44]. Control of patient flow within and between healthcare settings with proper infection prevention measures is necessary to decrease the chance of transmission of MERS-CoV.",

Sixty minutes after aerosolization, the virus remains infectious at 63.5% at 25 \u00b0C and 79% humidity, compared with only 4.7% at conditions 38 \u00b0C and 24% humidity [63]. MERS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR and viral culture up to 18\u201327 days after symptom onset from most of the touchable environments in patients' rooms [64]. Bed controller devices and thermometers were PCR positive until five days after the last positive PCR result from the patient's respiratory specimen [64]. MERS-CoV was cultured in four of seven air samples from patients' rooms, a restroom and a common corridor, and from 15 (22%) of 68 surface swabs [37]. MERS-CoV RNA was detected from anterooms, medical devices, air-ventilating equipment, bed sheets, bed rails, intravenous fluid hangers and X-ray devices [65]. These data suggest that environmental cleaning needs to be meticulous, and that laboratory data may be required to prove adequate disinfection to allow discontinuation of isolation procedures. Further studies are required to assess infectious risks of the environment in the presence of molecularly detected MERS-CoV RNA.",

Balkhy argues that three pillars are necessary: policies and procedures, facility and human resources, and accountability and leadership [66], [67]. How these goals could be achieved is demonstrated, in part, in one study using a core group of nurses for an education programme consisting of an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and hands-on practice to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs [68]. Another study called for the use of the \u20183Is\u2019 (identify\u2013isolate\u2013inform) tool in the emergency department to rapidly identify and isolate suspected cases with any emerging infectious disease [69].",

Some listed items are, by nature, parochial, including facility structure, knowledge and skills of HCWs, and patient-related issues. These can be individualized incorporating strategies that include education, feedback and tackling facility-related issues [70]. In a survey of 607 HCWs, hospital infrastructure and design, staffing shortfalls, and absence of infection control training were cited as the primary contributing factors for the spread of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare facilities [71]. In a study from Saudi Arabia of 228 trainees, half of the respondents indicated that their hospital had a clear plan while 28% did not feel that they were well prepared for MERS [72]. A targeted educational strategy increased HCWs' knowledge, skills and attitudes in private hospitals in Saudi Arabia [73]. Raising public awareness and recognition of the disease will also assist in preventing transmission [74].",

Currently, the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection best relies on viral detection by RT-PCR [75], [76], [77]. Lower respiratory samples have been shown to yield better diagnostic results than nasal or oral swabs. In two studies, lower respiratory samples showed higher Ct values than upper respiratory samples, and MERS-CoV virus was detected later in the course of the disease [76], [78]. The World Health Organization recommends that both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected whenever possible [79]. Improved diagnostic tools are needed for early diagnosis of the disease.",

Prompt recognition, isolation and management of the suspected cases are vital factors for the prevention of MERS transmission.

Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread of infection [86]. Healthcare facilities should take all the steps to learn from past experiences and build capacity for the prevention of outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and Ebola. Healthcare leadership and workers should strive to prevent future outbreaks. Failure to do so would mean that lessons learned from SARS, MERS and Ebola would be relegated to history, leaving patients, hospitals and HCWs vulnerable. Many infection control questions remain requiring further research, including a better understanding of the disease dynamics. Leading concerns include the role of asymptomatic individuals in transmission of the disease, and precise risk factors for transmission in healthcare facilities. Although data accrued have concentrated on respiratory transmission, the role of other body fluids and the built environment in transmission remains unknown. As zoonotic reservoirs for MERS-CoV may continue to produce sporadic human infections, rigorous infection control practices should prevent the virus from spreading past the hospital door.",
