            "text": "CXCL10 (IFN\u03b3-inducible protein of 10 kDa or IP10) plays an important role during viral infections such as influenza [1], SARS coronavirus [2], HIV [3] and West Nile virus [4]. Although initially identified to be an IFN\u03b3-responsive gene, a number of different cytokines including IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 are capable of inducing CXCL10 expression in diverse cell types. The chemokines CXCL4, CXCL9 (Mig), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) bind the receptor CXCR3 and exert a potent chemotactic effect on activated T lymphocytes [5]; however, CXCL10 is the one that plays the most prominent role during the antiviral responses. CXCR3 is expressed on 35\u201340% of normal blood T cells and its expression is enhanced by treatment [6] with IL-2. Additionally, CXCR3 is expressed on other cell types such as natural killer cells (NKs), eosinophils, B lymphocytes, and different epithelial and endothelial cell types. CXCR3 is a receptor that is coupled to a G protein-signaling pathway. Binding of chemokines to CXCR3 activates G protein-mediated signaling and results in downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC), kinase A and C, formation of phosphatidyl inositol-1,4,5-triphophate, and also the increase of intracellular calcium ions [7]. Despite the functional diversity of the cells that can express CXCR3, the downstream activation seems to be quite homogeneous, involving p44/p42 ERK, Akt, PI3K and p38 [5], [8], [9]. However, the effects of CXCR3 activation are very diverse, ranging from chemotaxis in T lymphocytes [8], [10], [11] and airway epithelial cells [9] to anti-proliferation in human embryonic kidney cells [10] and induction of apoptosis in acinar cells [12].",

            "text": "Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an active process morphologically characterized by shrinkage of the cell, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and chromosomal DNA fragmentation [13]. Apoptosis plays an essential role in tissue development and is required for maintaining tissue homeostasis [14]. Although apoptosis can be triggered by many different stimuli, executioner caspases always participate in the organized degradation of the cellular organelles; when activated, executioner caspases cleave a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins including caspases themselves and their downstream substrates [15] through controlled proteolysis [16]. Induction of apoptosis is a tightly regulated process and it is the balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptosis signals that eventually determines the fate of the cells [17]. Vlahakis et al. have shown that G protein-coupled chemokine receptors can activate both the survival and the apoptotic signaling pathways [18]. It has been reported that CXCL10 can trigger apoptosis in several cellular models, such as acinar cells [12], neurons [19], HeLa cells [20] and microvascular endothelial cells [21]; however, the role of CXCL10 in determining survival or death in blood T lymphocytes remains largely unknown.",

Upon treatment with IL-2, primary lymphocytes showed greatly enhanced expression of CXCR3. The increase in CXCR3 expression occurred in the CD8+ population, but not in CD4+ or CD20+ cells (Fig. 1\nA, B and E).

FACS analysis of cells stained with Annexin V and 7-AAD demonstrated that treatment of CXCR3-positive T cells with recombinant CXCL10 induces early apoptosis (Annexin V positive, 7-AAD negative), although to a very limited extent (Fig. 2\nA). Furthermore, pre-incubation of T cells with IL-2 (400 U/ml), which increases CXCR3 expression but not apoptosis rates (Fig. 2B and C), enhanced CXCL10-induced early apoptosis dramatically (Fig. 4C). Cell incubation with IFN\u03b1 alone (5000 U/ml) also leads to T cell early apoptosis. Moreover, the highest rates of early apoptosis were observed with simultaneous treatment with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFN\u03b1 (Fig. 2C). The cytokine treatments that were tested also produced increased necrosis rates (Annexin V positive, 7-AAD positive) in parallel with the observed rates of early apoptosis (Fig. 2A and B). To determine whether the cell death was CASP3-mediated, we analyzed whole cell lysates from T lymphocytes treated with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFN\u03b1; the presence of active cleaved fragments of CASP3 was assessed by western blotting using antibodies that recognize both procaspase 3 (p32) and cleaved CASP3 (p19, p17 and p12). As shown in Fig. 2D, independent treatments with CXCL10 or IL-2 or IFN\u03b1 did not result in appreciable CASP3 overexpression or cleavage. It was the combined treatment with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFN\u03b1 that caused the highest levels of CASP3 activation, closely followed by CXCL10 + IL-2.

CXCL10 (50 nM) induced a transient, time-dependent increase in Akt phosphorylation, reaching the maximum levels in 15 min and returning close to the basal levels in the 60-min time-point (Fig. 4A). When using a lower concentration of CXCL10 (10 nM), the phosphorylation peak was detected after 45 min of incubation, and the levels were still high 60 min after the beginning of the stimulation (data not shown). These findings were confirmed using western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Our results also suggest that CXCL10-mediated Akt phosphorylation is stronger when IL-2 and/or IFN\u03b1 are present (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the activation of the p44/p42 ERK kinases following exposure of peripheral T cells to CXCL10 + IL2 + IFN\u03b1. Exposure of CXCR3-expressing lymphocyte cells to CXCL10 (50 nM) resulted in a transient increase in p44/p42 ERK phosphorylation which peaked after 30 min of exposure to CXCL10 (Fig. 5A and B). However, in the assay where different combinations of cytokines were tested, the incubation time was too long (16 h) and the ERK phosphorylation was indistinguishable from the basal activation (Fig. 5B), indicating that the transient ERK activation had already extinguished. However, considering the other assays within this study, it is reasonable to conclude that ERK activation is stronger when CXCL10 incubation occurs in combination with IL-2 and/or IFN\u03b1.",

During a self-limited influenza infection process, high levels of CXCL10 can be detected during the early stages of the disease, and shortly after the virus has been cleared CXCL10 returns to its basal levels, even though other markers of inflammation and repair may remain elevated beyond that point [1]. On the other hand, in situations where the host fails to control the viral infection the levels of CXCL10, together with other ISGs and inflammatory mediators, remain highly elevated throughout the process and possibly cause detrimental effects by means of excessive immune activation and cell death [22]. We found that CXCL10 alone is a very modest inducer of apoptosis (according to the Annexin V results). Consequently, we needed to consider the addition of other lymphocyte activators that are present during antiviral responses in vivo to unleash the full potential of CXCL10. Since CXCL10 shows its true biological effects in combination with other cytokines, such as IL2 and IFN\u03b1, the signaling status upon treatment with this combination of cytokines was the focus of our study. It can be argued that the observed downstream signaling might not correspond to a pure CXCL10 response and some of the observed effects might be overlapping with those from IL2 or IFN\u03b1. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of these cytokines during viral infections is a proven fact that merits scientific attention, while an in vivo response mediated by CXCL10 alone is an unlikely scenario.",

Binding of different chemokines to CXCR3, such as CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, causes downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC), kinase A and C, formation of phosphatidyl inositol-1,4,5-triphophate, and increases intracellular calcium ions [7], [23]. Here we have confirmed that CXCR3 is expressed on blood T lymphocytes and its expression is greatly enhanced by IL-2 treatment [6] (Fig. 1). Moreover, we showed that IFN\u03b1 treatment significantly increases the expression of CXCL10 in T cells and HEK239 cells (Supp. Fig. 2); however, CXCL10 does not induce changes in the expression of its receptor, CXCR3 (Fig. 1C and D). Our observations are in accordance with previous studies which revealed that CXCR3 expression in T lymphocytes is fine-tuned and it is determined by the presence of certain cytokines [24]. It would appear that both CXCR3 + and CXCR3- populations of cells are undergoing apoptosis. While IL2 did not cause a detectable increase in the level of apoptosis (Annexin V) or CASP3 activation (Fig. 2C and D), CXCL10 and INF\u03b1 each alone caused a modest increase in apoptosis. The dual combination of Il-2 plus IFN\u03b1 induced substantially greater levels of apoptosis, and the combination of CXCL10 and IL-2 and the triple combination of IL-2, IFN\u03b1 and CXCL10 induced the highest levels of apoptosis. Therefore, it is likely that CXCL10 responsive CXCR3+ and CXCR3- cells are undergoing apoptosis.",

To determine whether cell death was CASP3-mediated, we analyzed whole cell lysates from T lymphocytes treated with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFN\u03b1 for the presence of active and cleaved fragments of CASP3 using western blotting probed with antibodies that recognize both procaspase 3 (p32) and cleaved CASP3 (p19, p17 and p12). As shown in Fig. 2D, independent treatments with CXCL10 or IL-2 or IFN\u03b1 did not result in appreciable CASP3 overexpression or cleavage. The highest levels of CASP3 activation resulted only with the combined treatment with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFN\u03b1, closely followed by CXCL10 + IL-2 treatment. Interestingly, treatment with IL-2 + IFN\u03b1 also resulted in CASP3 activation but at much lower levels.",

The anti-apoptotic Bcl2 has been identified as a p38 MAPK substrate [26], and by direct phosphorylation of Bcl2, p38 MAPK prevents Bcl2 from exerting its anti-apoptotic function and allows the apoptotic process to occur [27]. Our results did not clearly show any changes in the expression levels of Bcl2 upon incubation of T lymphocytes with CXCL10 + IL2 + IFN\u03b1; however, the phosphorylated form of Bcl2 was more prominent in the chemokine-treated group (Supp. Fig. 3) which confirms the activity of p38 MAPK.",

            "text": "Induction of cell survival is also a critical role of CXCL10 and other CXCR3 ligands. We found that pertussis toxin dramatically increased the rate of apoptotic T cells treated with CXCL10 + IL2 + IFN\u03b1, indicating that anti-apoptotic signals are G-protein dependent (Fig. 6); also, pre-treatment of T cells with wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) led to a significant increase in cell death (Fig. 6). The controls treated only with either pertussis toxin or wormannin did not show increased levels of apoptosis (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that these inhibitors triggered pro-apoptotic signals directly. These results show that CXCR3-mediated signaling plays a critical role in the induction of pro-survival signals in activated T lymphocytes; however, the exact mechanism requires further investigation. Later, we studied the activation profile of Akt, which is a downstream signaling mediator of PI3K. Akt was found to be phosphorylated in T lymphocytes treated with CXCL10 together with IL2 and/or IFN\u03b1, and its activation was found to be transient; strong Akt phosphorylation can be detected as early as 5 min after stimulation and it is barely detectable after 60 min (Fig. 4). Akt is crucial for cell survival, proliferation, gene expression and cell migration [8], and the pro-survival effects are explained, at least in part, by the fact that Akt inactivates the apoptotic factor BAD by direct phosphorylation [28]. PI3K and downstream activation of Akt are closely related; however, additional studies are required to elucidate some aspects of their association, such as the involvement of other PI3K downstream signaling mediators, the mechanism through which Akt phosphorylation is rapidly ended, or the conditions that would be necessary for sustained Akt activation. As previously demonstrated for CXCL12 and CXCR4, the loss of Akt signaling after transient activation may be the triggering event for chemokine-induced apoptosis [8], [18]. This process might be required not only to promote cell migration, but also to induce programmed cell death in T cells when CXCR3 ligands are highly expressed. As mentioned above, we found that CXCL10 induced transient phosphorylation of ERK in activated T lymphocytes; however, pretreatment of T cells with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (MEK is an upstream regulator of p44/p42 ERK) does not alter the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that CXCL10-induced activation of p44/p42 ERK does not play a relevant role in the survival/apoptosis signaling. Taken together, these results highlight the relevance of G-coupled chemokine receptor signaling to promote survival during lymphocyte activation, a mechanism in which the downstream signaling is mediated by PI3K and Akt.",

In vivo, CXCL10 participates in the activation of T lymphocytes during viral infections by priming toward the Th1 phenotype and inducing chemotaxis toward the infected tissues, however, the biological role of CXCL10 as modulator of apoptosis and survival in T lymphocytes is still unclear. We speculate that CXCL10 may help to focus the adaptive immune responses by inducing apoptosis of low-affinity T lymphocyte subsets [29], [30], including those lymphocytes that initially were activated but later lacked the appropriate sets of specific co-stimulating signals to ensure their survival (Fig. 7\n). Additional studies in terms of cell maturity, antigen selectivity, and Th1/Th2 phenotype are required to delineate the features of the T lymphocytes that are positively selected by CXCL10 from those which are depleted by apoptosis in the context of a viral infection.",

Lymphocytes were purified from healthy donor PBMCs using magnetic bead positive selection (Monocyte Isolation Kit II, Miltenyi Biotech) and cultured in the absence of IL-2 (A), the presence of IL-2 (B), the absence of CXCL10 (C) and the presence of CXCL10 (D). Phenotypic flow cytometry analysis was performed to assess CXCR3, CD8, CD84, and CD20 expression at the protein level. Percentages of CXCR3+ cells on gated viable cell populations are indicated within the panels, where the cutoff is determined by negative controls obtained by isotype-matched control antibody conjugated with PE. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Gates were based on the isotype controls.",

IL-2, which is also part of the early immune response, augments the proportion of CXCR3-expressing T lymphocytes and increases their responsiveness. CXCL10 binds its receptor CXCR3, and through transient phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42 ERK, CXCL10 participates in T lymphocyte activation, survival, proliferation, differentiation and chemotaxis toward the infection sites. However, additional co-signaling is required to maintain long-standing activation, and without it, CXCL10 induces p38-mediated apoptosis, which causes the elimination of low-affinity T lymphocyte subsets.",
