Previous studies have focused on using flow cytometry to quantitate poliovirus infection in neuronal cells (Daley et al., 2005) , characterize enterovirus binding to host cell surfaces (Freistadt and Eberle, 2006; Mbida et al., 1991; Triantafilou et al., 2001) , confirm cytomegalovirus infection of tissue culture cells with a genetically engineered fluorescence reporter system (Kung et al., 2000) , and serotype human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Zolla-Pazner et al., 1995) .

Data for flow cytometry and IFA are from cells stained with coxsackievirus B blend antibody. Flow cytometry detected positively staining, infected cells 1 day prior to IFA and appearance of CPE. cal application for flow cytometry in detecting enterovirus from culture. In this study, flow cytometry proved to be a sensitive method for detecting fluorescently stained enterovirus-infected cells. For both echovirus 30-and coxsackievirus B1-infected PMK cells, flow cytometry was able to detect infection 1 day before the viral infection became detectable by IFA. This is likely due to the ability of flow cytometry to quickly analyze a larger number of cells than is routinely examined by IFA. It was also able to quantitate the level of infection even when there are low numbers of virus-infected cells. The capacity to quantitate allowed for monitoring enterovirus infection in PMK cells over a 4-day period using different antibodies which gave similar results. The coxsackievirus B1 strain used in this study was highly efficient at infecting PMK cells compared to the echovirus 30 strain. As the predilection of different enterovirus serotypes and even strains within a serotype for different cells lines is well-known (She et al., 2006) , it is not surprising that a different rate of infection between the two serotypes used in this study was observed. False positives did not occur by flow cytometric analysis in that infected cells were negative after staining with isotype control antibodies and antibodies directed against other enterovirus serotypes. This is not surprising as the specificity of flow cytometry in general is related to the particular antibodies employed, and therefore, should be similar to microscopy based detection methods using the same antibodies. Also, uninoculated cells did not demonstrate positive staining with any of the antibodies used.

Shell vials were used to facilitate infection of cells with centrifugation, as is commonly done in the clinical virology laboratory. It is possible that a more efficient tissue culture system could be employed, such as use of multiple well plates (e.g., 96-well plate format). In this way the need for handling numerous shell vials per specimen is obviated. Others have found the use of centrifuged multiple well plates combined with blind immunoperoxidase staining for enterovirus to be both rapid and sensitive (Bourlet et al., 1998; Terletskaia-Ladwig et al., 2008) and this method can potentially be performed using fluorescent antibody staining followed by flow cytometric analysis instead. Because the PMK cells grow as a surface monolayer, trypsinization was used to create an optimal single cell suspension (Grogan and Collins, 1990) . Another potential option is the use of lymphocytic or monocytic cell lines which have been described for cultivation of a limited number of enterovirus serotypes (Okada et al., 1987; Skarsvik et al., 2006; Vuorinen et al., 1999 Vuorinen et al., , 1994 . Cultivation of enterovirus in such a manner would facilitate interrogation by flow cytometry and may be studied in the future. Other cell lines that are routinely used in the clinical laboratory for isolation of enterovirus, e.g., RD, MRC-5, and BGM, should also be investigated. Directly labeled antibodies are not commercially available for enteroviruses but would be useful in streamlining the protocol described. Multicolor flow cytometry could be used to simultaneously monitor infections of different cell types and/or viruses from a single culture.
