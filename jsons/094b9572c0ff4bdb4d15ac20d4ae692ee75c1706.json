With the mapping of the human genome and on-going mapping of genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes in humans, the fi eld of critical care is now in prime position to study the impact of genetics on common illnesses that affect children who require critical care, to examine how differences of the host defense response lead to variable outcomes in outwardly appearing similar disease states, and to study how genetic differences in response to therapy will help practitioners tailor therapeutic interventions to an individual child's genetic composition. While we are still years away from true individualized medicine, we are now closer than ever to understanding why two might children respond to the same environmental insult in vastly different ways.

DNA is responsible for determining the structure of the cell, the function and activity of the cell in response to various stimuli, and the interaction the cell has with other cells and the extracellular environment. The DNA molecule consists of two chains of deoxyribonucleotides held together by complementary base pairs. The deoxyribonucleotides contain the four nucleotide bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) that are covalently bound together by phosphodiesterase bonds linking the 5 \u00a2 carbon of one deoxyribose group to the 3 \u00a2 carbon of the next group. The two chains of deoxyribonucleotides are linked by hydrogen bonds between the A's of one strand and the T's of the other. Likewise, the G's of one strand are linked by hydrogen bonds to the C's of the complementary strand. These two complementary strands form the DNA double helix ( Fig. 11-1 ) , with one strand running in the 5 \u00a2 to 3 \u00a2 direction while the other strand runs in the 3 \u00a2 to 5 \u00a2 direction. The order of nucleotides bases is termed the sequence and is read in the 5 \u00a2 to 3 \u00a2 direction. The genetic information of an individual is encoded by the precise positioning and order of these base pairs.",

Every cell of an organism contains two copies of the DNA, with the exception of red blood cells which lack a nucleus and DNA and sperm and egg cells which contain one copy of the DNA. Overall, humans have 46 chromosomes, including 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of a centromere and two telomeres (ends) (Fig. 11-2 ). The two arms of the chromosome are the short arm (p) and long arm (q). The parts of the genome that contain nucleotide sequences that code for proteins are the genes and it is estimated that the human genome contains about 20,000-30,000 genes. The structure of genes is very complex and highly variable. Genes are made up of a variable number of exons , which contain the actual coding sequence for the proteins, and introns , which are noncoding regions which separate the exons. While the function of the introns is unclear, some disease processes have been found to be associated with certain nucleotide variations located in these intron regions ( Fig. 11-3 ). Genes also have regulatory regions, including promoter sequences that generally reside at the 5 \u00a2 end of the gene (referred to as upstream) and regions at the 3 \u00a2 end associated with stability of the mRNA.",

There are several different types of mutations. Translocations are large-scale mutations comprised of switching of chromosomal regions between one chromosome and another chromosome. Mutations can also consist of single changes in the nucleotide bases and include substitution, deletion, or insertion of nucleotides. Insertions and deletions can also involve hundreds of nucleotides. Mutations that occur in the coding regions can have several consequences: they can change the amino acid of the protein at a single site, they can cause a premature stop codon resulting in early termination of translation, and, consequently, lead to a truncated protein, or they may have no effect at all if the mutation leads to a nucleotide substitution that does not alter the amino acid. Likewise, mutations in noncoding regulatory regions (such as promoters) may also affect the expression of the gene by altering the quantity of mRNA transcribed and, hence, the level of the protein. Mutations in the intron/ exon boundary region may also lead to incorrectly spliced mRNAs and result in signifi cantly different proteins or differences in levels of protein products. The sequencing of the human genome has revealed that most genes are polymorphic; that is, there are small differences in the nucleotide sequences. There are estimates that the human genome may contain over 10 million of these types of variations. These differences in the nucleotide sequence are what give rise to our genetic variability; they account for inherited differences in our physical traits and the way we respond to environmental stimuli and medications. While the majority of these nucleotide variations do not cause a disease, some genetic variations may infl uence the development of certain diseases. The mutations discussed in the preceding paragraph are variations that occur in less than 1% of the population and are, thereby, rare. On the other hand, variations that occur at a frequency greater than 1% in the population are referred to as polymorphisms . If the polymorphism is a change in a single nucleotide, it is referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) . These more common genetic variations, whether SNPs or small insertions or deletions of nucleotides, are the ones currently being examined in many studies for associations with susceptibility to and outcome from diseases seen in the intensive care unit setting. Copy number variations (CNVs) are stretches of DNA of greater than 1 kb that show differences in the expected number of copies of the DNA in greater than 1% of the human population. Very recently it has become clear that CNVs are also common in human genomes and contribute significantly to human genetic variation.",

Keeping in mind the above discussion of genetic variations, a locus may contain two slightly different sequences for a specifi c gene. These alternative forms of a gene are termed alleles , or variants . The alleles for a specifi c individual at a genetic locus is that person's genotype . An example is the surfactant protein B (SP-B) +1580 site. An individual's genotype at that site may either be TT, CT, or CC. Individuals are heterozygous if they possess two different alleles at the locus of interest and homozygous if they possess two identical alleles at that locus. But we obviously do not contain only one genetic variation in our genome. A haplotype represents a combination of polymorphic alleles on a single chromosome delineating a pattern that is inherited together and transmitted from parent to offspring. Haplotype analysis is a useful tool for analysis of disease gene discovery, as investigators may capitalize on the fact that many of the polymorphisms of interest are not transmitted independently of each other, and the presence of one gene variant can tag the presence of another polymorphism from the same chromosome. In some cases, haplotype assessment can provide a higher level of specifi city, sensitivity, and accuracy in \"true\" associations with disease risk or severity. By focusing on haplotypes as well as SNPs, researchers are now able to more accurately study genetic predisposition to various diseases of interest. With the recent report of the International HapMap Consortium, and the identifi cation and cataloging of haplotypes now available, the utility of this type of study is brought into focus as an important tool to guide genetic association studies on complex human diseases.",

This occurs by a combination of two distinct processes: transcription and translation. Transcription is the process by which the genetic information in DNA is transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). mRNA differs from DNA in that it is singlestranded, has a modifi ed sugar backbone, and contains uracil (U) instead of T. The process of transcription involves the unwinding of the two complementary strands of DNA, the enzyme RNA polymerase binding to the promoter region of a gene on a single strand of DNA, and synthesizing the mRNA molecule by adding ribonucleotides in an order that is complementary to the DNA strand. The transcribed mRNA thus contains all the genetic information between the transcriptional start and stop sites on the DNA including exons and introns. The non-coding intron sequences are removed by a process referred to as splicing which connects all the exons together to form the fi nal mRNA product. This mRNA represents the coding DNA sequences for a single gene. (It should be noted that splicing variations have been identifi ed that infl uence disease processes that impact the fi nal protein product by altering the mRNA sequences that are spliced together.) The mRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm, and translation occurs, in which the genetic information from mRNA is utilized to guide the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are composed of amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids in humans, and each is encoded by a set of 3 nucleotides in the mRNA. These three nucleotides are called triplets or codons .

Since all cells that contain a nucleus carry the full set of genetic information, it is necessary for gene expression to be selective and tightly controlled, in a way that guarantees specifi c proteins are expressed in specifi c cells under appropriate conditions. This differential expression of genes ensures that cells develop correctly, can differentiate and function as specialized cells, and can mount various responses to external stimuli. In certain disease states, expression of specifi c genes may change, thereby providing a clue as to which genes may be important in that disease process. Recent advances in technology have provided a valuable tool to evaluate the expression of genes during various diseases, including sepsis. These technologies include DNA microarrays, in which the basic approach is as follows: small strands of DNA probes representing the genes of interest, for example, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a ), are attached to a solid substrate such as a glass slide or silicon chip (in reality, thousands of probes are applied to the same micorarray chip). mRNA is then isolated from, for example, a patient without acute lung injury (ALI) and one with ALI. These two samples are then separately converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) in a manner which incorporates different fl uorophores in the two samples of cDNA (e.g., red into all the cDNAs from the patient with ALI which would also include cDNA made from the mRNA coding for TNF-a , and green into all the cDNAs from the patient without ALI including the cDNA made from the mRNA coding for TNF-a ). The cDNAs from the two patients are then mixed and hybridized to the chip containing the DNA probes. Thus, if TNF-a is up-regulated in ALI and there is signifi cantly more cDNA in the ALI sample than the non-ALI sample, then more red fl uorophore -labeled cDNA would be present. When the mixture of cDNAs is hybridized to the chip containing the probes, the probe for TNF-a would light up red and represent increased expression of the TNF-a gene in ALI. If TNF-a is expressed at a lower concentration in the patient with ALI then when the samples are mixed, more green fl uorophore-labeled cDNA would be present than red fl uorophore-labeled cDNA, and the probe for TNF-a on the microarray chip would light up green indicating decreased expression of TNF-a gene in ALI. Finally, if there is no change in the expression of the TNF-a gene, the amounts of red and green fl uorophorelabeled cDNAs would be equal, and the probe for the TNF-a gene would light up yellow. In this fashion, one can identify specifi c genes that are expressed in the development of ALI. Several examples of the use of this technology in the critically ill patient have been published which have aided our understanding of the pathophysiology of certain ICU specifi c diseases.",

A person may possess both susceptibility and protective genetic variants for the same disease, and the mix of these variants will impact together the overall genetic risk of that person to the disease of interest. This resultant genetic risk also interacts with the environmental risk of the individual, leading to the overall risk of that person developing the disease. In critical care, it is unlikely that one gene will cause the diseases that are treated in the intensive care unit; it is more likely that multiple genes will interact with multiple environmental insults to predispose individuals to diseases processes resulting in an overall risk for an individual patient to develop a certain disease of interest. Interestingly, certain populations seem to be immune to certain complex diseases. Examples include the Australian aborigines and Inuits from Greenland, in which both populations appear to be resistant to the development of type 1 diabetes. It is plausible that the disease resistance observed in these populations is due to absence of susceptibility gene variants or presence of protective gene variants in the group's gene pool.",

Genes that were up-regulated, down-regulated, or unchanged between the groups were examined. The genes that were up-regulated when the septic shock group was compared to healthy controls included genes related to immunity and infl ammation as would be expected. Unexpectedly the study demonstrated that many genes related to zinc biology and zinc homeostasis were down-regulated. The signifi cance of this fi nding was supported by the observation that children who did not survive septic shock had lower serum levels of zinc and the demonstration in a murine model that zinc depletion leads to increased mortality from sepsis. In addition, genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling and antigen presentation appeared decreased suggesting that septic shock may be associated with depression of the adaptive immune system. Interestingly expression studies of adults with sepsis and septic shock did not identify a down-regulation of genes related to zinc biology although upregulation of genes related to immunity and infl ammation and down-regulation of genes related to the adaptive immune system was observed. The longitudinal study in children with septic shock demonstrated that in general the observed changes in up-regulated and down-regulated gene expression persisted over time. In addition, the study comparing expression in children with shock to those with sepsis or SIRS indicated that while there were patterns of expression that were similar in all three groups (such as genes involved in innate immunity that were up-regulated) there were genes that were unique to the septic shock group with relation to the degree, and duration, of the response. Examples include the fi nding that up-regulated genes that were involved in the IL-10 signaling pathway had a greater signal which persisted for longer in the septic shock patients and down-regulation of genes for zinc biology and the adaptive immune system was greater and lasted longer than that seen in the other two groups. In addition to providing insight into the pathophysiology of sepsis and identifying potentially important proteins in early sepsis, the use of this technology may also provide physicians with a unique diagnostic tool. If the gene expression profi le of a patient who is in the early stages of sepsis is different from a patient who exhibits SIRS but does not develop sepsis, then earlier therapies could be initiated before full blown sepsis is clinically evident. There is also some evidence that various subclasses of sepsis and septic shock may be able to be identifi ed using this technique.",

The pathophysiology of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in patients with sepsis is thought to involve, in part, intravascular fi brin deposition. Thus, elevated PAI-1 activity could contribute to organ failure in sepsis and elevated plasma concentrations have been observed in patients with sepsis. A genetic variation in the gene coding for PAI-1 consisting of either the presence of 4 guanines or 5 guanines at a specifi c location appears to infl uence the amount of PAI-1 produced. Individuals homozygous for the 4G genotype (4G/4G) produce more PAI-1 than individuals homozygous for the 5G genotype (5G/5G) or individuals that are heterozygous (4G/5G). Association studies have demonstrated that children with meningococcal disease who were 4G/4G at this site had an increased risk of death compared to children who were 4G/5G or 5G/5G. More recent studies in both children and adults have demonstrated higher mortality in individuals homozygous for the 4G allele in a number of infectious diseases. Since fi brin deposition is thought to play a role in the multiple organ system failure in patients with sepsis, genetic variations that infl uence the production of fi brin might also infl uence the severity of disease in patients with sepsis. The production of fi brinogen, the precursor to fi brin, is dependent on the transcription of fi brinogen-beta . Several polymorphisms in the promoter region have been associated with higher plasma levels of fi brinogen, and higher levels of fi brinogen have been associated with improved outcomes in sepsis. Association studies have demonstrated that the GAA haplotype, consisting of the genotypes at the \u2212854, \u2212455, and +9006 sites, is associated with higher levels of fi brinogen and with decreased mortality and less organ dysfunction. Protein C has anticoagulant activity as well as anti-infl ammatory and anti-apoptotic effects suggesting that diminished activity of protein C may lead to increased fi brin deposition, infl ammation, and apoptosis. Genetic polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the gene coding for protein C result in decreased levels. Association studies in Caucasian and Han Chinese adults have demonstrated increased mortality and organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis who carry the A allele at the \u22121641 site and the C allele at the \u22121654 site. This haplotype has also been reported to be associated with decreased protein C concentration. Interestingly, an increased risk of more severe sepsis has been observed in children less than 1 year of age with meningococcal disease who carry the G allele at the \u22121641 site along with the C allele at the \u22121654 site. This haplotype was not associated with severe sepsis in older children suggesting a potential developmental difference in these variations on the severity of sepsis.",

Major causes of direct lung injury include pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary contusion, and inhalation while major causes of indirect injury include sepsis, trauma without pulmonary contusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and multiple transfusions. Despite these various causes, the central pathogenesis of ALI involves derangements in multiple biological processes. These include activation of infl ammation, loss of coagulation and fi brinolytic homeostasis, disruption of vascular permeability, epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis as well as proliferation, and derangements in surfactant. Some of these processes, notably infl ammation and coagulation, play key roles in the pathophysiology of sepsis as well as ALI. Thus, it is not surprising to fi nd that the candidate genes examined in genetic association studies for ALI are in many cases the same as those examined in sepsis (Table 11 .2 ).

Several genetic variations exist in the genes coding for the surfactant proteins and two will be discussed here; the SP-B + 1580 T/C polymorphism and insertion/deletion polymorphism consisting of dinucleotide (CA) tandem repeats in intron 4. Several studies have demonstrated an association between these polymorphisms and the need for mechanical ventilation in children (SP-B + 1580 T/C) and mechanical ventilation and ARDS in adults (SP-B + 1580 T/C polymorphism and insertion/ deletion of dinucleotide (CA) tandem repeats). The consequences of these variations are not fully known. The SP-B + 1580 T/C polymorphism results in an amino acid change in exon 4 in a region of the amino terminal propeptide which is thought to play a role in targeting of SP-B to lamellar bodies. The resulting amino acid change alters glycosylation of SP-B and may affect the level of SP-B by altering its processing or stability. Aberrant proteolytic processing of the SP-B product encoded by the C allele is supported by a recent report demonstrating that the C allele is associated with absence of a specifi c pro-SP-B cleavage product in neonates. The intron 4 dinucleotide repeat length variation polymorphism is associated with incompletely spliced SP-B mRNA. Interestingly, in Caucasians this length variation polymorphism in intron 4 is in linkage disequilibrium with the SP-B + 1580 T/C polymorphism; the C allele of rs1130866 is associated with the deletion variants at the intron 4 polymorphic site.

ACE is present in pulmonary endothelium and is responsible for converting ATI to ATII. ACE levels are elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid of adults with ARDS and higher levels are associated with mortality from ARDS. The key component is most likely ATII, which has apoptotic effects on alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro . ATII receptor antagonists block pneumocyte apoptosis in a model of meconium aspiration. Another important component of this system is ACE2, a homologue of ACE expressed in human lungs, which is a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system as well as the probable receptor for the SARS virus in humans. Lung injury models using knockout mice lacking the ACE2 gene have higher ATII levels and exaggerated lung injury compared to wild type mice. However, the lung injury is reversed if the ACE gene is inactivated in the ACE2 knockout mice. This suggests that ACE induces lung injury through ATII and that ACE2 protects against lung injury. Indeed, ACE inhibitors and ATII antagonists appear to decrease the severity of lung injury in animal models, the risk of aspiration pneumonia in some adult populations, and reduce the 30-day mortality in adults with pneumonia.

Whether it be inhaled b 2 -agonists, or the array of intravenous vasoactive agents, sedatives, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, steroids, etc.; all bind to protein receptors and either activate or block specifi c signal transduction pathways, many bind protein carriers or transporters, and most are metabolized by various protein enzymes. Every gene coding for each of these proteins has multiple genetic variations with the potential to infl uence the levels or activities of these proteins. The area of pharmacogenomics attempts to determine the infl uence of genetic variations in genes affecting these various aspects of drug action. However, while the list of genetic polymorphisms in genes affecting drug action is growing rapidly, there are few clinical examples of the degree of infl uence that these genetic variations have on the response to drugs in the PICU. For example, warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant for long-term prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders and is used in many children and adults with mechanical valves. The metabolism of and response to warfarin involves several enzymes, two of which exhibit genetic variations that dramatically alter the levels of warfarin. For one of these genes, CYP2C9, the common allele is referred to as CYP2C9*1 and is consider the wildtype while CYP2C9*2 contains a C to T nucleotide change at position 430 in exon 3 and CYP2C9*3 contains an A to C nucleotide change in exon 7. CYP2C9*2 has approximately 80% of the metabolic activity of the wild type CYP2C9*1 while CYP2C9*3 contains only 20% of the wildtype activity. By also using genetic variation in a second gene, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 or VKORC1, one can account for more than 50% of the observed dosing variability. Current practice in the use of warfarin usually involves starting at an age and weight specifi c dose and monitoring coagulation studies. However, because of the genetic variations in these two enzymes and perhaps others, different patients take different amounts of time to achieve the appropriate therapeutic dose. Knowing the specifi c genotypes of patients prior to initiating warfarin may allow for more appropriate dose selection, less time to achieve therapeutic levels, and less risk of adverse events. Recently, an algorithm using the patient's genotypes at these two sites has been developed that allows for more accurate dosing in some populations. Although these algorithms are being developed and tested it should be kept in mind that they do not account for drug-drug interactions.",

Finally, the impact of the genetic variant on the protein product must possess biologic plausibility as impacting the development or the outcome of the disease of study. Only after all of these criteria are met should clinicians be comfortable moving to the arena of tailoring therapy based on genetic variations. 4. You are caring for two brothers with acute lung injury secondary to smoke inhalation from an apartment fi re. These two infants were apparently sleeping in the same crib when they were rescued simultaneously by fi re fi ghters. The fi rst infant was extubated within 48 h of intubation and is doing well with a minimal oxygen requirement. The second has experienced a much more severe lung insult and remains intubated on high frequency oscillatory ventilation. In attempting to understand the difference in their clinical response to the seemingly identical insult, you suspect that it may be related to a polymorphism in one of the genes that codes for surfactant protein B. In considering this possibility, which of the following is true? A. Although plausible, it is unlikely to be associated with a polymorphism because polymorphisms are rare occurring in less than one percent of the population. B. It is not plausible because variances in the translation of such a complex protein require differences in an entire haplotype, and not simply a single nucleotide polymorphism. C. It is plausible because genetic polymorphisms may infl uence the quantity of mRNA transcribed and/or the functional activity of the surfactant protein B. D. It is unlikely as there are no reports of associations between surfactant protein gene polymorphisms and outcomes from pulmonary disease. E. It is unlikely because dysfunctional surfactant protein B demonstrates an X-linked pattern of inheritance. ",
