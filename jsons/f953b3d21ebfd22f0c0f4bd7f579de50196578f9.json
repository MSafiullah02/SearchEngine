In the present study, a virulent Korean pandemic PEDV strain, KNU-141112, was serially propagated in Vero cells for up to 100 passages. Through cell culture adaptation, we obtained four distinct deletion (DEL) mutants by plaque purification followed by nucleotide sequencing of the spike (S)/ORF3 gene-coding region, which were designated KNU-141112-S DEL2, \u2212S DEL5, \u2212S DEL2/ORF3, and \u2212S DEL5/ORF3. Further whole genome sequencing identified 12 or 14 amino acid changes in the celladapted DEL strains. Animal inoculation studies revealed that the virulence of both S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ ORF3 viruses with a large 46-nt deletion in the intergenic portion of S and ORF3 was remarkably diminished, indicating viral attenuation in the natural host. Furthermore, these cell-adapted strains elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses in immunized pigs.

PED virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of PED, is a large, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978; Lee, 2015) . The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail, and is composed of a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) designated ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORFs 2 through 6, and a 3\u2032-UTR (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978; Kocherhans et al., 2001; Saif et al., 2012) . The first two large ORFs, ORF1a and 1b, encode replicase polyproteins, pp la and pp 1ab, which undergo autoproteolysis by viral proteases to eventually produce 16 processing nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16). The remaining ORFs code for the four canonical structural spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of coronaviruses and a single accessory gene, ORF3 (Lai et al., 2007; Lee, 2015) . On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the S gene, PEDV can be divided into two genotypes, designated genogroup 1 (G1; classical or recombinant and low-pathogenic) and genogroup 2 (G2; field epidemic or pandemic and high-pathogenic), which are genetically and antigenically distinct. Each genogroup is composed of two subgroups, 1a and 1b, and 2a and 2b, respectively (Lee, 2015; Lee et al., 2010; Lee and Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 218, "text": "(Lee, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 219, "end": 237, "text": "Saif et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 449, "end": 477, "text": "(Pensaert and Debouck, 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 478, "end": 488, "text": "Lee, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 737, "end": 765, "text": "(Pensaert and Debouck, 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 766, "end": 790, "text": "Kocherhans et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 791, "end": 809, "text": "Saif et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1216, "text": "(Lai et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1227, "text": "Lee, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1611, "text": "(Lee, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1629, "text": "Lee et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1648, "text": "Lee and Lee, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1665, "text": "Oh et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although PED outbreaks have been reported in Europe and Asia, the veterinary health impact and related economic losses have been most devastating in Asian swine-producing nations in the past two decades.

Currently, a limited number of PEDV vaccines, either modified live or inactivated/killed, are commercially available in South Korea. These vaccines contain a single G1a classical strain (Korean SM98-1 or DR-13 strains, or Japanese 83P-5) and, in many cases, are not fully protective against genetically divergent field strains. The incomplete efficacies of current PEDV vaccines might be ascribed to antigenic or genetic differences between the major S glycoprotein of the vaccine and field epidemic strains Lee, 2015; Lee et al., 2010 Lee et al., , 2014a Lee and Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014) . Considering these issues, there is a strong demand for a new vaccine to be developed against G2b epizootic or related strains prevalent in the field. In general, attenuation of the virulence of a wild-type virus can be achieved by sequential passage in non-host cell lines. The attenuated virus can be explored to prepare a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. Indeed, current live PEDV vaccines were created by continuous passages of classical G1a strains in African green monkey kidney-derived Vero cells (Kweon et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2011; Song et al., 2007) .

For plaque purification of high-passage derivatives of KNU-141112, single plaques of KNU-141112-P80 and -P90 (80th and 90th passage of KNU-141112, respectively) were picked, and the nt sequences of the full-length S genes were individually determined. Preliminary nt sequencing initially identified four different patterns of deletions (DEL): a 6-nt (two amino acids) DEL in the N-terminus of S1 (S DEL2), 15-nt (five amino acids) DEL in the N-terminus of S1 (S DEL2), S DEL2 plus a large 46-nt deletion of the intergenic junction between the C-terminus of S and Nterminus of ORF3 (S DEL2/ORF3), and S DEL5 plus the identical deletion (S DEL5/ORF3). The plaque-cloned viruses with the individual DEL patterns were further propagated up to 100 passages to produce virus stocks that were designated KNU-141112-S DEL2, KNU-141112-S DEL5, KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3, and KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3. Like the parental virus, all cell-adapted DEL strains were capable of producing PEDV archetypal CPE, such as cell fusion, multi-nucleated cell formation (syncytium or polykaryon), and detachment, in infected Vero cells. CPE onset occurred at 12 hpi, and prominent CPE was observed within 24 hpi for the parental and cell-adapted viruses. Virus propagation was confirmed by detecting PEDV antigens by IFA using a PEDV N-specific MAb. The distinct staining was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in typical syncytial cells (Fig. 1A) . Attractively, the DEL strains caused noticeable CPE and IFA staining showing vacuolation and syncytia in giant multi-nucleated cells that were bigger and more predominant in cells infected with KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3 and KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3 (Fig. 1A, arrows) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1655, "end": 1664, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1928, "text": "(Fig. 1A, arrows)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Phenotypic characteristics of cell-adapted DEL strains were altered in vitro"}, {"text": "To investigate the in vitro phenotypic traits of serially passaged DEL strains, the amounts of infectious virus were assessed by virus titration.

One-step growth curves revealed that growth of the parental virus increased gradually and reached a peak titer at 48 hpi (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, growth kinetics of the cell-passaged DEL strains were faster and titers were higher until 24 or 36 hpi, relative to the parental strain.

Except for their own DEL pattern in the S gene and/or ORF3 of individual strains, no additional insertions and deletions were found throughout the genomes after cell culture passage. The 5\u2032-UTRs of all DEL strains remained unchanged, whereas the 3\u2032-UTR was completely conserved only in S DEL2. The remaining strains had a G to T substitution at a position 6 in the 3\u2032 UTR (S DEL5 and S DEL5/ORF3) or A to T and G to A substitutions at positions 135 and 193 in the 3\u2032 UTR (S DEL2/ORF3), respectively. The 100th-passage S DEL2 and S DEL2/ ORF3 strains contained 14 aa changes that were distributed randomly throughout the genome, whereas the S DEL5 and S DEL5/ORF3 virus equally had 12 aa variations (Table 1) . Overall, 28.6% to 42.9% (4-6 aa changes) of 12 or 14 non-silent mutations emerged in nsps, whereas 57.1% to 71.4% (7-10 aa changes) occurred in structural S and E and accessory ORF3 proteins. No mutations arose in the M and N proteincoding regions. Details in aa mutations among the parental KNU-141112-P5 and cell-adapted DEL strains are summarized in Table 1 . Further phylogenetic analyses based on the entire genome and fulllength S indicated that all cell-adapted DEL strains still belonged to subgroup G2b along with the parental virus and global epizootic strains (Fig. 2) The most outstanding feature of the genetic alterations resulting from the serial passage of KNU-141112 in Vero cells was the emergence of extraordinarily small and/or large deletions in the high-passage (at least 70) viruses. The first DEL pattern was short 6-nt or 15-nt deletions in the S gene, resulting in 2-aa (S N-DEL2) or its extended 5-aa (S N-DEL5) deletions at positions 56-57 and 56-60, respectively at the Nterminus of S (Fig. 3A) . The second DEL was a combination pattern by a large 46-nt deletion in the intergenic portion of S and ORF3 (nt positions 24,771-24,8l6), leading to a malfunction in the authentic termination and initiation of S and ORF3, respectively. As a result, an alternative TGA termination codon in S occurred at the 7th position downstream from the last T, just before the beginning of the deletion, creating a truncated S product with a 5-aa shorter cytoplasmic domain (S C-DEL5) with 2 aa mutations (F1380H and E1381D) at the last two positions of the S gene product compared to the parental virus (Fig. 3B ). In addition, because the first start codon of ORF3 was interrupted, one of the two potential events could be anticipated: the disruption of ORF3 expression or the exploration of an alternative start codon for ORF3 expression. The former would result in no production of the corresponding protein, whereas the latter would instinctively promote the use of a second ATG initiator located 188 nt downstream from the deleted region, leading to the generation of an N-terminal-truncated ORF3 product with the 70-aa deletion (ORF3 N-DEL70) (Fig. 3C) . The third type of DEL pattern was an uncommon DEL resulting from the substitution of GCT to TGA terminator sequence at positions 409-411 in ORF3 (25, 204 at the genome level). These changes caused premature termination 264 nt upstream from the expected stop site, indirectly removing 88 aa residues in the C-terminus of ORF3 (ORF3C- S. Lee et al. Veterinary Microbiology 207 (2017) 248-258 DEL88) (Fig. 3C ). The DEL fourth signature was a minor 3-nt TCG deletion covering the codons for 2 residues, phenylalanine and valine, at positions 163 and 164 in the C-terminal portion of ORF3. The first two nt are located at the last two underlined positions of the TTC triplet for phenylalanine, whereas the last nt is placed at the first underlined position of the GTT codon for valine. Although this mutation led to a reading frame shift, the remaining first T and last TT of the triplets for phenylalanine and valine, respectively, created a new TTT triplet for phenylalanine, resulting in the single loss of the next valine residue at position 164 of ORF3, followed by recovery of the altered frame shift (ORF3 C-DEL1) with no further mutations (Fig. 2C) .

Thus, cell-adapted KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3 and KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3 strains were chosen for subsequent animal studies to assess the in vivo phenotypic changes associated with serial in vitro passage, a common tool for virus attenuation, of the virulent KNU-141112 strain. The pathogenicity of the parental KNU-141112-P5 and its cell-passaged derivatives, KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3 and KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3, was characterized in pigs. Fourteen piglets divided into four groups of three or four animals each were challenged orally with parental KNU-141112- P5 (group 1), KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3 (group 2), or KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3 (group 3), and the remaining three piglets in a control group were inoculated with cell culture medium. Clinical signs were recorded daily, and fecal swabs were collected prior to and after challenge for the duration of the study. During the acclimation period, all piglets were active, showed no clinical symptoms, had normal fecal consistency, and no PEDV genetic material was detected by PEDVspecific RT-PCR in fecal samples from any piglet. Following challenge, none of the negative-control piglets developed clinical signs typical of PEDV throughout the pathogenicity study. In contrast, KNU-141112-P5-challenged piglets (group 1) exhibited clinical signs including lethargy and diarrheic feces by 1 DPI (mean CSS of 0.33), and experienced severe watery diarrhea with vomiting thereafter (mean CSS of > 3.0) (Fig. 4A) . PEDV-associated mortality occurred in all inoculated animals in group 1 at 4 or 5 DPI. Strikingly, the cell-adapted DEL virus-inoculated piglets in groups 2 and 3 underwent neither PEDV-specific clinical symptoms nor death throughout the experiment, even though some pigs inoculated with KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3 had mild and fluidic feces at 2 and 3 DPI. All inoculated piglets in group 1 were positive for PEDV, as determined by RT-PCR, by 1 DPI with a mean Ct value of 29.88 (equivalent to 10 2.25 TCID 50 /ml), and they shed increasingly amounts of PEDV in feces with Ct ranges of 8.49-12.02 (10 5.17 -10 5.74 TCID 50 /ml) until they died (Fig. 4B) .

Neither macroscopic nor microscopic intestinal lesions were observed in the negative control piglets (panel vi).

In South Korea, despite substantial efforts, including a nationwide vaccination campaign for PEDV control, this devastating virus has menaced the domestic swine industry over the last two decades and become endemic, thereby causing continuous financial disbenefits. To prevent emerging and re-emerging PEDV-associated epizootics and enzootics, it is critical not only to continue monitoring and characterizing the virus circulating in pig-producing regions but also to make unremitting exertion of the development of more effective vaccines. Our circumstances have increased the need for safe and efficient nextgeneration PEDV vaccines based on field epizootic strains. We recently isolated and propagated a Korean high entero-pathogenic PEDV strain in Vero cells that is genotypically identical to the G2b global field strains . In the present study, we obtained PEDV MLV vaccine candidates by 100 passages of the virulent KNU-141112 strain in Vero cells and ascertained the genetic and pathogenic characteristics of these strains. An initial sequencing analysis using the traditional Sanger method verified four cell-adapted variants that each contained small DEL patterns in the N-terminal part of S (S DEL2 and S DEL5) or a combination of S DEL and a large DEL in the intergenic junction between S and ORF3 (S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3). The virological assays revealed that the cell-adapted DEL viruses grew more efficiently and formed larger plaques than the parental virus in cultured cells. The parental KNU-141112-P5 virus generated homogeneous pinpoint-sized plaques, whereas DEL strains each produced heterogeneous plaques (a mix of at least two sizes) (Fig. 1D ). S DEL2 infection resulted in the formation of small, relatively homogeneous plaques in Vero cells, whereas the S DEL5 strain formed a mixture of tiny-, medium-, and large-sized plaques. Intriguingly, the S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 strains exhibited almost identical large plaques, along with a few tiny plaques. Altogether, these findings indicate that the cell-adapted DEL strains had a superior viral fitness in the cultured cells and that DEL patterns positively influenced in vitro viral growth.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1863, "end": 1871, "text": "(Fig. 1D", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Subsequently, we sequenced the entire genomes of the DEL strains to decode the precise DEL patterns and genetic mutations that emerged during serial cell passage. Upon cell adaptation, a total of 12 or 14 non-synonymous mutations arose in ORFs 1 through 4. Interestingly, 6 aa substitutions were accumulated in the nonstructural viral proteases nsp3 and nsp5 and structural proteins S and E of all DEL strains, suggesting that some of these changes are associated with virus adaption in the cell cultured system. The S protein can be divided into four structural domains: a signal peptide, a large external domain that is further separated to two subdomains (S1 and S2), a transmembrane domain, and a short carboxyl terminal cytosolic/ virus-internal endodomain (Lai et al., 2007) . The S protein induces fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, and this membrane fusion activity is most like conferred by the internal hydrophobic sequences in the S2 portion (Lai et al., 2007; Lee, 2015) . The cell-adapted strains formed more extensive syncytia, resulting in an increase in vacuolated areas that were proportional to plaque sizes. Since all DEL strains contained G888R and E1287Q mutations in the S2 fusion domain, these genetic drifts may contribute to cytopathology. In the S protein of PEDV, two neutralizing epitopes have been identified at aa positions 748-755 and 764-771 (Sun et al., 2008) . The aa residues that comprise these epitopes remained unchanged throughout cell passages. The PEDV S protein is heavily glycosylated, and the parental KNU-141112-P5 strain contains 21 potential Nglycosylation sites defined by N-X-S/T, where X is any aa except proline. All of the cell-adapted DEL strains were found to contain either an N381K or T383N mutation in the N-S-T glycosylation sequon at positions 381 to 383 of the parental virus S protein. Additionally, the S DEL2/ORF3 strain lost one more potential sequon (NIT at positions 514 to 516 of S) by containing a strain-specific T516I change. Consequently, 20 or 19 N-glycosylation sites were predicted in the DEL strains, with one or two missing motif(s), respectively. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, but inconsistent in that a new motif, in close proximity site or at a distinct location, was created to compensate the loss in other cell-attenuated strains, resulting in an identical number of the N-glycosylation sites Sato et al., 2011) .

The first S N-DEL2 or S N-DEL5 and the fourth ORF3 C-DEL1 were classified as minor DEL patterns because of the number of nt deletion at respective positions in S or ORF3. Compared with classical G1a strains, S genes of G2 epidemic field strains, including KNU-141112, are 9-nt (3-aa) longer, resulting from distinct genetic signatures, S insertions-deletions (S INDELs) consisting of two notable 4-aa and 1-aa insertions at positions 55/56 and 135/136, respectively, and a 2-aa deletion at positions 160 and 161 of S (Lee et al., 2010; Lee, 2015) . The S N-DEL2 and S N-DEL5 patterns emerged at the first insertion footprint in S genes of G2 field strains, and, accordingly, the S N-DEL signatures of cell-adapted strains were analogous to those of the classical G1a strains, except for their lengths. The second pattern was a major DEL signature, with a large 46-nt deletion at genomic positions 24,771 through 24,816, spanning the junction between S and ORF3. Interestingly, this major DEL signature is almost the same as that present in the Korean cell-adapted vaccine strain SM98-1 (GenBank accession no. GU937797), which possesses an extended 52-nt deletion at similar positions ( Fig. 2B and C) . Thus, SM98-1 is predicted to encode an alternate S protein with a 7-aa excised cytoplasmic domain that is two aa shorter than those of S DEL2/ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 and either no ORF3 or an N-DEL70-truncated ORF3 identical to that identified in this study. Additionally, another Korean vaccine strain, DR-13, also has a large 17-aa deletion at positions 82-98 in ORF3; this deletion resulted spontaneously from continuous nt deletions at the corresponding positions (Park et al., 2008) . Lastly, the remaining DEL signature contained a massive 88-aa deletion in the Cterminus of ORF3 (ORF3 C-DEL88). Similarly, Wang et al. (2012) reported an attenuated PEDV that encodes a C-terminal-truncated ORF3 protein of 91 aa compared to the 224 aa in the wild-type virus. However, our finding differed in that the ORF3 gene of the attenuated virus in the previous study had a 49-nucleotide deletion, leading to a reading frame shift, and a TAG terminator at nt 274 of ORF3 farther upstream than the ORF3 C-DEL88 in the present study. More strikingly, with the exception of KNU-141112-S DEL2, the cell-adapted DEL strains contained the discontinuous multiple DEL signatures. As aforementioned, several cell-attenuated vaccine strains retain large deletions in ORF3 and encode truncated ORF3 variants, suggesting that this genotypic feature is associated with the loss of PEDV virulence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 620, "end": 638, "text": "(Lee et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 639, "end": 649, "text": "Lee, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1789, "text": "(Park et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1933, "text": "Wang et al.

The findings from previous and present studies suggest that major genetic changes in ORF3 resulting from cell culture adaptation could be answerable for decreases in the pathogenicity of virulent PEDV strains, albeit contributions from other mutations or deletions, especially in the S gene, cannot be excluded. Although the exact function of PEDV ORF3 remains unknown, it has been proposed to consist of four transmembrane (TM) domains that form a tetrameric assembly (Wang et al., 2012) . PEDV ORF3 has also been shown to encode an ion channel protein, and TM4 at aa positions 151-172 in ORF3 may be important for potassium channel activity (Wang et al., 2012) . More interestingly, an attenuated PEDV that encodes a truncated ORF3 without the TM3 and TM4 domains was found to lack ion channel activity (Wang et al., 2012) . However, one of the attenuated DEL strains, KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3, possesses a truncated ORF3 gene of 153 aa that is predicted to comprise domains TM2 to TM4 and, accordingly, to retain ion channel activity. Therefore, ion channel activity of the ORF3 product may be irrelevant to PEDV virulence. Specific knockdown of ORF3 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in PEDV-infected cells reduced the number of virus particles in cells, indicating that ORF3 modulates virus production (Wang et al., 2012) . Inconsistent with this previous work, we found that cell-adapted DEL strains with large deletions in ORF3 grew efficiently in cell culture. Moreover, a recent study also revealed that the PEDV ORF3 product is unnecessary for the replication of virus in cultured cells (Li et al., 2013) . Taken together, data indicate that the accessory ORF3 gene is dispensable for PEDV replication in vitro. Despite an ignored function in virus propagation in vitro, conservation of the complete ORF3 in PEDV field isolates suggests that the ORF3 protein has a critical role in natural infection in the animal host.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 614, "end": 633, "text": "(Wang et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 788, "end": 807, "text": "(Wang et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 950, "end": 969, "text": "(Wang et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1468, "text": "(Wang et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1756, "text": "(Li et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we generated four distinct DEL strains through in vitro serial passage, and demonstrated the loss of virulence of cell-adapted viruses with heavy deletions in ORF3 in vivo and the retention of immunogenicity of these cell-attenuated strains in pigs. A growing body of evidence proposes that polygenic traits might be involved to correlate with phenotype properties of PEDV, but ORF3 may be an important viral component to determine the pathogenic features. Here, the data obtained from the current study showed that the cell-adapted S DEL2/ ORF3 and S DEL5/ORF3 viruses were completely attenuated in vivo, indicating that the ORF3 defect resulting from extensive deletions may contribute to altered PEDV pathogenicity in the natural host. Further, the present work supports the notion that genetic changes associated with virulence hallmarks in PEDV are concentration in ORF3. However, it is still plausible that other genetic mutations identified in the attenuated DEL viruses are involved in the pathogenicity of PEDV, implying the multigenic character of PEDV virulence. Future work should aim to address the questions of whether genetic drifts in other genes, especially in nsps and S, influences PEDV virulence and what the specific role of the ORF3 protein is in viral replication and pathogenesis. Altogether, our findings provide insights into pioneering the development of a next generation live vaccine based on either the attenuated G2b S DEL2/ORF3 or S DEL5/ORF3 strain. To accomplish this task, our next step will be sow vaccination and challenge experiments to evaluate the protective efficacy of the vaccine candidate against virulent PEDV and to assess its safety concern in neonatal piglets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Efficacy of an inactivated genotype 2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus vaccine in neonatal piglets", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Baek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Choi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Yoon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "Vet.

No PEDV antigen was detected in the jejunums of piglets inoculated with KNU-141112-S DEL2/ORF3 (panels G and H) or -S DEL5/ORF3 (panels I and J), or a mock-inoculated piglet (panel L).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Summary of amino acid mutations among the parental KNU-141112-P5 and the DEL derivative viruses during in vitro serial passages.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>ORFs </td><td>Encoding protein\n</td><td>aa </td><td>P5 </td><td>S DEL2 </td><td>S\n</td><td>S DEL5 </td><td>S\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>DEL2/\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>DEL5/\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>ORF3\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>ORF3\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>(aa length) </td><td>positiona\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>ORF1a </td><td>nsp2\n</td><td>192 </td><td>T </td><td>T </td><td>T </td><td>I </td><td>T\n</td></tr><tr><td>(774)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>nsp3\n</td><td>1564 </td><td>S </td><td>F </td><td>F </td><td>F </td><td>F\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>(1,621)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>2178 </td><td>I </td><td>L </td><td>L </td><td>I </td><td>I\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>2182 </td><td>C </td><td>F </td><td>F </td><td>C </td><td>C\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>nsp5\n</td><td>3186 </td><td>T </td><td>I </td><td>I </td><td>I </td><td>I\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>(302)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>ORF1b </td><td>nsp12\n</td><td>142 </td><td>K </td><td>N </td><td>K </td><td>K </td><td>K\n</td></tr><tr><td>(927)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>nsp13\n</td><td>1025 </td><td>T </td><td>I </td><td>T </td><td>I </td><td>I\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>(597\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1165 </td><td>A </td><td>A </td><td>A </td><td>S </td><td>S\n</td></tr><tr><td>ORF2 </td><td>S (1,386) </td><td>272 </td><td>K </td><td>T </td><td>T </td><td>T </td><td>T\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>381 </td><td>N </td><td>N </td><td>K </td><td>N </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>383 </td><td>T </td><td>N </td><td>T </td><td>N </td><td>N\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>516 </td><td>T </td><td>T </td><td>I </td><td>T </td><td>T\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>888 </td><td>G </td><td>R </td><td>R </td><td>R </td><td>R\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1287 </td><td>E </td><td>Q </td><td>Q </td><td>Q </td><td>Q\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1380 </td><td>F </td><td>F </td><td>H </td><td>F </td><td>H\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1381 </td><td>E </td><td>E </td><td>D </td><td>E </td><td>D\n</td></tr><tr><td>ORF3 </td><td>ORF3\n</td><td>26 </td><td>D </td><td>Y </td><td>-b </td><td>Y </td><td>-\n</td></tr><tr><td>(224)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>135 </td><td>K </td><td>K </td><td>S </td><td>K </td><td>K\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>166 </td><td>N </td><td>S </td><td>- </td><td>S </td><td>S\n</td></tr><tr><td>ORF4 </td><td>E (76) </td><td>70 </td><td>P </td><td>S </td><td>S </td><td>S </td><td>S\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Total no. of nt/aa changes </td><td>22/14 </td><td>28/14 </td><td>19/12 </td><td>19/12\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Amino acid position numbering is based on the sequence of KNU-141112-P5 strain. b This is the deleted region in ORF3.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "This research was supported by Bio-industry Technology Development Program through the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (iPET) funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (315021-04).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgment"}]}
