DENV2 infection induced dynamic changes in actin organization, and treatment with Cytochalasin D or Jasplakinolide disrupted microfilament dynamics, reduced DENV2 entry, and inhibited DENV2 assembly and maturation. Rac1 activities decreased during the early phase and gradually increased by the late phase of infection. Expression of the dominant-negative form of Rac1 promoted DENV2 entry but inhibited viral assembly, maturation and release. Our findings demonstrated that Rac1 plays an important role in the DENV2 life cycle by regulating actin reorganization in EAhy926 cells.

However, the course of this illness may become complicated and result in the life-threatening clinical form of the disease, i.e., severe dengue. This condition includes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are characterized by systemic hemorrhage and increased capillary permeability. However, the mechanism underlying the increased vascular permeability induced by DENV infection is currently unclear. Recently, a morphological study identified hemorrhage, edema and swollen vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in several organs in fatal dengue patients, and viral antigens and negative-strand RNA were detected in VECs, hepatocytes and macrophages (Povoa et al., 2014) . This finding indicated that increased vascular permeability and morphological changes of VECs are characteristic pathological features of severe dengue.",

            "text": "The junctional complex in adjacent cells plays important role in maintaining the permeability of VECs. Its role is attributed to a complex association of actin filaments. These filaments are a significant element of endothelial barrier function, which is regulated by linking the filaments to the cytoplasmic tail of junctional adhesive proteins as well as extracellular matrix proteins such as integrins. These complexes then regulate the shape and motility of VECs. In fact, viruses depend on the host cellular machinery to perform their replication life cycle, and a number of cellular components are involved in virus-cell interactions (Angelini et al., 2013; Lyman and Enquist, 2009; Monaghan et al., 2005) . Cortical actin filaments directly below the cell membrane form a multifaceted network that provides aphysical barrier to the penetration of viruses and endocytic vesicles (Hanley, 2014; Pfanzagl et al., 2014; Weir et al., 2014) . This actin network must be modulated to allow viruses to enter the cell and permit the consequent steps of the viral life cycle, especially intracellular trafficking. Thus, the actin cytoskeleton is one of the first components of the host cell to be disrupted to efficiently establish an infection with a diverse set of viral pathogens (Kallewaard et al., 2005; Sodeik et al., 1997; Stefanovic et al., 2005) . Treatment with actin filament inhibitors reportedly affects the entry, replication and release of some viruses via the disruption of actin filament dynamics (Bass et al., 1995; Morrison and McGinnes, 1985) . During West Nile virus (WNV) maturation, actin filaments play a key role in viral release (Chu et al., 2003) . Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton plays an indispensable role in influenza virus entry into epithelial cells (Sun and Whittaker, 2007) . Our previous study has demonstrated that DENV2 infection induced the rearrangement of microfilaments, and the small GTPase Rac1 played a central role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton during DENV2 infection in ECV304 cells, a mammalian cell line (Wang et al., 2010) . Moreover, we also found that DENV2 infection increased the expression of \u03b23 integrin (Zhang et al., 2007) , which may serve as a receptor or co-receptor of DENV2 to mediate viral entry into human microvascular endothelial-1 cells (HMECs-1) and ECV304 cells. The intracellular region of integrins closely associates with actin filaments, and the interplay of \u03b23 integrin and DENV2 might trigger actin reorganization to then affect capillary endothelial integrity. Because ECV304 does not act as an endothelial cell line and the mechanisms of infection of host cells by viruses are cell type-dependent, the necessity of actin and Rac1 for the infection of endothelium-like cells with DENV2 must be confirmed.",

In the absence of vasoactive stimuli, dominant-negative Rac1 affects the function of tight junctions and increases endothelial permeability. Specifically, Rac1 has been suggested to directly regulate these processes. Furthermore, Rac1 negatively regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Lamaze et al., 1996) , and some studies have shown that Rac1 is essential for viral infections depending on the regulation of various signal pathways. For example, adenovirus endocytosis requires the assembly of actin via the activation of phosphatidyl inositol kinase-3 (PI3K) and Rac1 (Sanlioglu et al., 2000) . Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may alter the activity of Rac1, which consequently facilitates HBV replication (Tan et al., 2008) . Murine leukemia virus can activate Rac1 in HeLa cells (Krishna and Le Doux, 2006) . However, the role of Rac1 activity in the regulation of VEC infection with DENV remains poorly understood.",

Moreover, the disruption of actin filaments with Cyto D or Jas inhibited viral entry, assembly and maturation (i.e., decreased E protein levels and intracellular viral titers).

Together, these findings indicate that actin is involved in all steps of the DENV2 replication cycle. Cyto D and Jas are known to destabilize actin dynamics via different mechanisms: Cyto D inhibits the polymerization of subunit by binding to the plus-ends of the actin filaments, whereas Jas enhances actin stabilization by inhibiting the depolymerization of actin filaments. Under our experimental condition, the disruption of actin filaments with these two inhibitors elicited similar effects on each step of DENV2 replication cycle, indicating that the dynamic tread milling of actin is important for virus infection.",

            "text": "Rac1, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is an intrinsically inefficient hydrolyzing enzyme that quickly cycles between its GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms. Rac1 has been implicated in the negative regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Lamaze et al., 1996) and also plays a central role in regulating both actin cytoskeletal remodeling and the integrity of intercellular junctions. Recent studies demonstrated that Rac1 plays important roles in many virus infections by regulating actin organization (Jimenez-Baranda et al., 2007; Li et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2007) . For example, adenovirus endocytosis requires the assembly of actin via the activation of Rac1. Integrin \u03b23 regulates DENV2 entry into HMEC-1 cells (Zhang et al., 2007) , and Rac1 is required for integrin-dependent cytoskeletal assembly (Li et al., 1998) . HIV-1 Env-guided entry is supported by a Filamin A-RhoA-ROCK axis and Arp2/3 complex, both of which are commonly involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization (Jimenez-Baranda et al., 2007) . In this study, DENV2 infection decreased the activities of Rac1 during the early phase of infection, and the role of Rac1 GTPase in the regulation of DENV2 infection was further clearly demonstrated by the increase in virus entry into cells expressing Rac1-N17. These results suggest that viral receptors may initially mediate transient Rac1 inactivation in response to DENV2 binding and/or internalization, and Rac1 might act as a negative regulator of DENV2 entry. Because the Rac1 dominant-negative mutants showed a reduced affinity for nucleotides and cells expressing Rac1-N17 was similar to cells pretreated with Cyto D or Jas, the increase in viral entry observed may be due to the abrogation of downstream active Rac1 signaling, especially the inhibition of actin filament function.",

Specifically, it increased viral entry during early infection and decreased viral replication during the late stages of infection, which may be due to the synergic effect of various signaling pathways evoked by infection, including host anti-viral responses (Dai et al., 2011; Green et al., 2014; Hishiki et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2013) . The aforementioned synergistic effects were further demonstrated by the decreased levels of E protein and intracellular viral titers as well as the decrease in the ratios of extra-and intracellular viral titers observed at the same time point, indicating that Rac1 played an important role in the assembly, maturation and release of DENV2. We previously demonstrated that the transfection of the E gene of DENV2 could trigger the activation of endogenous Rac1. We also showed that the expression of E protein induced the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Wang et al., 2010) . These results indicate that viral protein-activated Rac1 is involved in DENV2 infection via the regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization. In this study, the Rac1 dominant-negative mutant and Cyto D or Jas treatment elicited similar effects, indicating that activated endogenous Rac1 contributes to the rearrangement of actin filaments during DENV infection and may further influence intercellular junctions and be closely associated with the pathogenesis of severe DF.",

During the early phase of infection, decreased Rac1 activity facilitates virus entry, whereas the level of active Rac1 increased during the late phase of infection to inhibit DENV2 assembly, maturation and release. Our results suggest that Rac1 is involved in DENV2 replication via the regulation of actin reorganization. Overall, this study reveals that the Rac1-actin pathway can be co-opted by DENV2 to create a microenvironment that favors the establishment of successful infection. Insight into the DENV2-host interaction not only aids in the design of novel anti-viral drugs but also contributes to our understanding of viral pathogenesis.",
