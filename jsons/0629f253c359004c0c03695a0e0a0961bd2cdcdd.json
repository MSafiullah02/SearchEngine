            "text": "RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modeling and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro (Konermann et al., 2018) . Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells (Konermann et al., 2018) . However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needed to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pc-sk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly downregulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.",

Here, we set out to compare the CasRx system with spacer sequence-match shRNAs in knockdown of Pten via transient transfection in N2a cells. Consistent with previous studies, Pten-targeting shRNAs rendered wide-spread off-target transcript changes (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, transfection of the spacer-matched CasRx system induced significantly fewer transcript changes (Fig. 1D ). Importantly, Pten was the most significantly changed gene (Fig. 1D ).

CasRx, sgPten-5, and sgPten-6 were delivered to the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of indicated plasmids ( Fig. S3A ). Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection, a simple yet effective method, can be used to deliver naked DNA into hepatocytes of mouse liver in vivo. After 96 h of plasmid injection, individual hepatocytes were dissociated through liver perfusion. Hepatocytes expressing both GFP and mCherry implied successful vector delivery and were purified through cell sorting. Though not mathematically significant, results suggested that the Pten mRNA level in GFP+/ mCherry+ hepatocytes had decreased in comparison with that in GFP\u2212/mCherry\u2212 hepatocytes (Fig. S3B) .",

Pten-inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling was found to be critical for lipogenesis regulation in the liver, while the activated AKT repressed SREBP1, a key transcription factor required for the expression of Fasn (Haeusler et al., 2014) . Therefore, decrease of PTEN promoted the expression of Fasn and Srebp1 (Fig. 1I) . Pten is also involved in regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver (Haeusler et al., 2014) . AKT positively regulates the transcriptions of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) in hepatocytes (Haeusler et al., 2014) . Here, the CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pten, a negative regulator of AKT activity, led to the decreased expression of G6pc and Pepck in GFP+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1J) . Together, the above results indicated that the CasRx system could be used to functionally knock down Pten in vivo.",

These results support our long-term goal to model and develop therapies of metabolic diseases. Over the past few years, advancements in CRISPR systems have provided plentiful tools for genome editing, epigenetic modification and transcript activation/inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the development of a CasRx-mediated in vivo gene knockdown system is becoming more relied upon for disease modeling, genetic screening, mechanism studies, and therapeutic purposes. Remarkably, different from CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing with permanent disruption of DNA in vivo, CasRx-mediated modification is used to target RNAs, instead of genomic DNA (Konermann et al., 2018) . This impermanent modification makes the CasRx system more valuable for modeling metabolism disorders considering the required reversible downregulation of metabolism genes. Moreover, CasRx-mediated modification can ideally also be used for therapeutic applications in clinical metabolism disorders because of its advantages in terms of reversible manipulations of gene expression.",

Indeed, many drug candidates were first designed to target proteins that are produced by the hepatocytes in order to correct metabolic disorders. Because hepatocytes are composed of a large fraction of polyploid cells, the multiple copies of an individual gene in one hepatocyte make CRISPR/Casmediated gene knockout less efficient. Thus, posttranscriptional silencing approaches attracted much attention for disrupting gene expression in the liver, which can rely on the CasRx system for modulation of mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. The successful CasRx-mediated gene knockdown in hepatocytes is expected to be beneficial to similar approaches in other cells. Compared to other approaches of gene knockdown with RNA interference, the CasRx system-derived approach was more specific and efficient (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018) . In this study, we demonstrated that the CasRx system could efficiently target RNA for knockdown in hepatocytes, providing a robust method to inactivate genes in polyploid cells in vivo.",

A Cas9-based DNA-targeting strategy has been reported to function in disruption of genome DNA or DNA intermediates of viruses (Price et al., 2015) . However, RNA viruses with neither genome DNA nor DNA intermediates, such as deadly SARS-Cov-2 (2019-nCov), SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and influenza A virus, could not be targeted by DNA-targeting CRISPR effectors. Recently, RNA-targeting Cas13 was experimentally validated for its antiviral activity in cell lines infected with singlestranded RNA viruses (Freije et al., 2019) . In this study, we validated that CasRx, a Cas13 family protein, could also functionally target RNA in vivo, further supporting the potential use of CasRx in RNA-targeting therapies. ",

(B) Knockdown of Pten by a combination of sgPten-5 and sgPten-6 in N2a cells (n = 3). (C) PTEN and its downstream signaling protein AKT were analyzed by western blot in N2a cells transfected with plasmids encoding CasRx and two sgRNAs. (D) Left, Volcano plot of differential transcript levels between Ptentargeting (sgPten-5+6) and non-targeting (NT) CasRx guide RNAs (n = 3). Right, Volcano plot of differential transcript levels between Pten-targeting (shPten-5+6, n = 2) and non-targeting (NT) CasRx guide RNAs (n = 3). (E) Design of PBase and CasRx plasmids used for knockdown of Pten in hepatocytes by hydrodynamic tailvein injection. (F) Representative PTEN and phospho-Akt (Ser473) immunofluorescence staining on liver sections from sgPten treated mice (n = 3). The lower-left insets are high-magnification views, indicating hepatocytes with reduced PTEN staining and corresponding improved phospho-Akt staining. Scale bar: 100 \u03bcm. (G and H) GFP+ hepatocytes were sorted for the quantification of Pten mRNA levels (n = 4) (G) and protein levels (H). Elevated phosphorylation of AKT was observed in GFP+ hepatocytes (H). (I) The expression of fatty acid synthesisassociated genes, Fasn and Srebp1, quantified by qPCR (n = 4). (J) The expression of glucose metabolism genes, G6pc and Pepck quantified by qPCR (n = 4). Data are represented as mean with SD. P + G F P -G F P + G F P -G F P + G F P -G F P + G F P -",
