Additionally, despite the availability of free mobile health (m-health) applications for diabetes self-management, usage is low. There are also limited studies of m-health acceptance in South Africa. This research is delineated to the Western Cape, South Africa. The populace suffers from increasing numbers of diabetic patients. Segments of the population also suffer from technological forms of exclusion, such as limited internet access. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify challenges for user acceptance that discourages the use of m-health applications. This study analysed 130 semi-structured interviews, using thematic content analysis. Respondents were predominantly female with type 2 diabetes, older than 50, residing in the Western Cape. It used key constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results confirmed that all four UTAUT constructs; performance expectancy (\"the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in performance\"), effort expectancy (\"the degree of ease associated with the use of the system\", social influence (\"the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system\") and facilitating conditions (\"the degree to which an individual believes that an organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system\"), explains the challenges for m-health acceptance in low socio-economic areas. Factors such as technology anxiety, resistance to change and a lack of trust in the use of devices for self-management need to be considered when implementing future interventions.",

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the leading underlying cause of death in women (7.2%) and second amongst both genders and people of all ages [5] . It is forecasted that by the year 2040, one in every ten adults residing in LMICs will be living with diabetes [6] . Therefore, selfmanagement is an important part of the treatment in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) [7] such as diabetes. Diabetes self-management is crucial to ensure that longterm complications are decreased. Diabetes self-management is based on seven selfcare behaviours [8] . These include; healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medication, problem-solving, healthy coping, and reducing risks [8] .",

However, funding will be required to implement training initiatives and health care in the Western Cape has experienced significant downsizing of personnel as well as population growth exceeding funding growth [44] . Essentially, training among older users is required as participants mentioned that they would accept m-health application given that assistance is available for any m-health difficulties. To raise the level of acceptance among older users, personal contact persons should be available during the initial phase of use. Despite having access to technology, patients are unable to complete self-management activities on their own due to lack of resources to download m-health applications.
