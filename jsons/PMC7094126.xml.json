            "text": "In the last few decades, several methods to classify genes and proteins have been proposed. Most of these methods are alignment-based in which optimal alignments are obtained by using selected scoring systems. These methods provide accurate classification of biological sequences, and several algorithms have been developed and successfully applied (Katoh et al., 2002, Edgar, 2004, Larkin et al., 2007). Nevertheless, their major drawback is due to significantly high time and memory consumption which is not suitable when a quick clustering needs to be made, for example on a new deadly virus (Marra et al., 2003). Henceforth, an alignment-free technique is a trending method that often gives much faster classification on the same dataset (Vinga and Almeida, 2003, Yau et al., 2008, Yu et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2013). For example, the k-mer method is among the most popular alignment-free methods. In order to measure how different the two sequences are, the set of k-mers, or subsequences of length k, in the two biological sequences are collected and then the evolutionary distance between them is computed (Vinga and Almeida, 2003, Pandit and Sinha, 2010). The k-mer method gives comparable results to alignment-based methods while being computationally faster (Blaisdell, 1989).",

During recent years, DFT has been increasingly used in DNA research, such as gene prediction, protein coding region, genomic signature, hierarchical clustering, periodicity analysis (Tiwari et al., 1997, Anastassiou, 2000, Kotlar and Lavner, 2003, Vaidyanathan and Yoon, 2004, Afreixo et al., 2004, Afreixo et al., 2009, Tenreiro Machado et al., 2011). A DFT power spectrum of a DNA sequence reflects the nucleotide distribution and periodic patterns of that sequence, and it has been applied to identify protein coding regions in genomic sequences (Fukushima et al., 2002, Yin and Yau, 2005, Yin and Yau, 2007). In this paper we provide a new alignment-free method to classify DNA sequences based on the DFT power spectrum. The method is tested and compared to other state-of-the-art methods on various datasets for speed and accuracy.",

Hence, \u2211k=0N\u22121PSA(k)=NAN. So it is reasonable for \u03b1\nj\nA to be a power of N\nAN. As stated above, we want moments converge to zero gradually so that information loss is minimal, thus \u03b1jA=1/(NAN)j\u22121 is the best choice (which will be verified later). Therefore MjA=1NAj\u22121Nj\u22121\u2211k=0N\u22121(PSA(k))jWith this normalization, M1A=\u2211k=0N\u22121PSA(k)=NAN. Our experimental results on various datasets proved that this is a good normalization. However, by re-examining the formula, we find that a slight modification can be made to get better outcomes. From Section 2.1, we know PSA(0)=|FA(0)|2=|\u2211n=0N\u22121uA(n)|2=NA2. Thus PSA(0) might hold large weight compared to PSA(k) for other index k, which in turn leads to unnecessary memory consumption and computations for higher moments. Therefore, the terms PSA(0) are removed from the moments, and M\n1\nA becomes \u2211k=1N\u22121PSA(k)=NAN\u2212PSA(0)=NAN\u2212NA2=NA(N\u2212NA). From the first modified moment, we know how to adjust the scaling factor for the j-th moment in general, i.e. \u03b1\nj\nA must be a power of NA(N\u2212NA). Thus the new normalization is MjA=1NAj\u22121(N\u2212NA)j\u22121\u2211k=1N\u22121(PSA(k))jThe fact that higher moments tend to zero is verified as follows: MjA=NA(N\u2212NA)\u2211k=1N\u22121(PSA(k)NA(N\u2212NA))j=NA(N\u2212NA)\u2211k=1N\u22121zkjwhere zk=PSA(k)/NA(N\u2212NA). Notice that \u2211k=1N\u22121zk=1, thus it is obvious that limj\u2192\u221e\u2211k=1N\u22121zkj=0.",

Additionally, due to symmetric property of DFT coefficients (Oppenheim et al., 1989), we only have to consider the first half of power spectrum. Therefore, the moments are improved as follows: MjA=1NAj\u22121(N\u2212NA)j\u22121\u2211k=1\u230aN/2\u230b(PSA(k))jThe moments for other nucleotides C,G,T are given similarly. Then the first few moments are used to construct vectors in Euclidean space. Our experimental results show that three moments are sufficient for an accurate clustering. Thus, each gene or genome sequence can be realized as a geometric point in the 12-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. (M1A,M1C,M1G,M1T,M2A,M2C,M2G,M2T,M3A,M3C,M3G,M3T). Pairwise Euclidean distances between these points are calculated to cluster the gene or genome sequences. We call this Power Spectrum Moments method, or PS-M method.",

Motivated by that idea, we discovered a way to scale moments naturally, and only normalized moments are used to construct the Euclidean vectors. Discarding the first coefficient is another novelty of our PS-M method. The first coefficient holds significant weight and is highly dependent on the number of the respective nucleotide, which is redundant information. We also exclude the second half of the power spectrum due to its symmetry, and we give proof as to why the moment vectors converge to zero.

Eighteen H serotypes (H1 to H18) and eleven N (N1 to N11) serotypes of Influenza A viruses have been identified. Influenza A viruses are the most dangerous due to their wide natural host range, including birds, horses, swines, and humans; and they are known to have high degree of genetic and antigenic variability (Palese and Young, 1982, Garten et al., 2009). Influenza A viruses have caused many pandemic flues, some of the most lethal subtypes are H1N1, H2N2, H5N1, H7N3, and H7N9. These subtypes will be chosen to test the efficiency of our method. Specifically, we will examine segment 6 of Influenza A virus genome, which encodes for neuraminidase (NA). As illustrated by the phylogenetic trees, the virus A/turkey/VA/505477-18/2007(H5N1) is not correctly clustered in the k-mer method (Fig. 5).

Past works have classified HRV into three genetically distinct groups within the genus Enterovirus and the family Picornaviridae (Palmenberg et al., 2009, Deng et al., 2011). In their paper, Palmenberg et al. (2009) clustered the complete HRV genomes, consisting of three groups HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C of 113 genomes and three outgroup sequences HEV-C. While the genomes were well classified, the running time was quite high due to the use of multiple sequence alignment to construct the evolutionary tree. By our method, the phylogenetic tree is reconstructed and the three groups of HRV are clearly separated and are distinguished from the outgroup HEV-C (Fig. 6\n).

Thus, identification and classification of coronaviruses, especially human coronaviruses, are important and have been extensively studied so far. We cluster the set of 30 coronaviruses and 4 outgroup non-coronavirus sequences using the PS-M method. This coronaviruses dataset has been used by various authors before, e.g. Woo et al. (2005) and Yu et al. (2010). In van der Hoek et al.

In Woo et al. (2005) the authors agreed to include the newfound HCoV-HKU1 in group 2 but also claimed that it is a distinct member within the group and it is not very closely related to the rest of the group. Yu et al. (2010) noticed that HCoV-HKU1 is an individual coronavirus between SARS group 4 and the traditional group 2, thus they proposed HCoV-HKU1 belongs to a new group 5. In our phylogenetic tree below (Fig. 8\n), HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are clustered into group 1, which is similar to the work of van der Hoek et al. (2004). Moreover, group 5 is close to both group 4 and group 2 but separated from them, thus the result is consistent with the work of Woo et al. (2005) and Yu et al. (2010). Based on Fig. 9\n, the HCoV-NL63 is misplaced from group 1 by the k-mer method.",

            "text": "EMBL-EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/) is among the most common online tool for MAFFT. We tested our datasets on this site but there were errors for coronavirus and mammals genomes, namely \u201cRaw Tool Output\u201d as it appeared on the EBI website. Since the input DNA sequences worked for all other methods, the error seems to be the tool\u05f3s problem. Therefore, despite MAFFT\u05f3s reasonable biological classification and fast processing time, it has some drawbacks that is likely to require some restriction on the underlying dataset. Another obvious disadvantage of this online tool is that it does not allow us to save the phylogenetic tree directly to the computer, and it does not have circular tree option for dataset with a large number of elements. Thus, we do not include the phylogeny of HRV and Influenza A generated by MAFFT in this paper due to these reasons, even though the method can reasonably classify these datasets. However, the running time of MAFFT for HRV and Influenza A is still recorded in Table 1.",
