            "text": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the main cause of morbidity and mortality due to diarrhea in travelers to and children under five in the developing world (World Health Organization 2006), producing a profuse watery diarrhea due mainly to the effect of secreted enterotoxins, either or both of a large multimeric heat-labile toxin or the smaller heat-stable peptide toxin. The plasmid-encoded heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-I) of classical ETEC is structurally, functionally and immunologically related to cholera toxin (CT) of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera (Sack 2011). A second group of ETEC (type II ETEC) possesses chromosomally-encoded heat-labile enterotoxins (LT-II) that are structurally and functionally related, but immunologically non-cross-reactive to CT and LT-I (Guth et al. 1986). Together CT, LT-I and LT-II form the heat-labile enterotoxin family. The chromosomal locus encoding LT-II toxins is currently undefined. Diagnosis of ETEC requires specialized tests not routinely performed in clinical microbiology laboratories (Sj\u00f6ling et al. 2007), and as LT-II toxins bind different ganglioside receptors and are genetically divergent from LT-I, even these techniques (e.g. GM1-ELISA or PCR) will not detect LT-II strains, and their contribution to diarrheal disease in both humans and animals is currently unknown. Type II ETEC were originally identified by biological assays for enterotoxin activity that was not neutralizable by CT or LT-I antisera (Green et al. 1983), and have been found in human clinical isolates (Seriwatana et al. 1988), diseased bovines (Pohl et al. 1989) and from foodstuffs such as hamburger and milk (Franco et al. 1991). Initial studies identified two strains that produced LT-IIa (Pickett et al. 1986) or LT-IIb (Pickett et al. 1989) variants. Recently, a third variant (LT-IIc) was described (Nawar et al. 2010) in a strain isolated from sick ostriches (Nardi et al. 2005), and the LT-II family now consists of three related subgroups \u2013 LT-IIa, LT-IIb and LT-IIc enterotoxins. The contributions of LT-II toxins to disease has received little study, while initial studies showed that purified LT-IIa did not cause fluid accumulation in rabbit intestinal loops (Holmes, Jobling and Connell 1995), a recent study showed that purified LT-IIa and to a lesser extent LT-IIb did so in intestinal loops of calves, and that cloned copies of LT-IIa and LT-IIb alone, present in an otherwise non-toxigenic porcine E. coli strain, were capable of causing severe diarrhea and weight loss in a neonatal pig model (Casey et al. 2012). The first genomic analysis of a large collection of type II enterotoxin strains (Jobling and Holmes 2012) showed that (i) the prototype LT-IIa and LT-IIb toxin types are rare (found in only 6% and 2% of isolates, respectively), that (ii) six subgroups of LT-IIc toxin genes are found the majority of the type II isolates, and that (iii) all LT-II toxin genes are flanked 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 by phage-related genes, suggesting that they may be prophage-encoded. All genes immediately 5\u2032 of the LT-II genes encode very similar phage lysozyme-like proteins (Pei and Grishin 2005) of the glycosyl hydrolase 108 family (Stojkovi\u0107 and Rothman-Denes 2007), while the immediate 3\u2032 phage-related genes are conserved within but differ between the LT-IIa, LT-IIb and LT-IIc families (Jobling and Holmes 2012).",

            "text": "All members of the heat-labile enterotoxin family are encoded by two genes encoding precursor polypeptides of the enzymatic A and receptor-binding B subunits. These are secreted to the periplasm with concomitant removal of their signal sequences, where they assemble into the latent holotoxin consisting of a single A subunit and a homo-pentameric B subunit. The B pentamers confer specificity on the toxin by binding to specific host cell gangliosides that differ between family members. The first step in activation of the latent holotoxin is proteolytic nicking (by either bacterial or host proteases) of the A subunit within a disulfide-distended loop that generates the A1 and A2 subunits. Reduction of the disulfide bond within the host cell is required for the ultimate release of the catalytically active A1 subunit into the host cell cytoplasm, where it binds and hydrolyzes NAD, transferring the ADP-ribose moiety to an arginine in the stimulatory alpha subunit (Gs\u03b1) of heterotrimeric G-protein complex. This constitutively activated ADP-ribosylated Gs\u03b1 permanently activates host adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP levels that in intestinal cells ultimately lead to increased chloride secretion and production of profuse watery diarrhea characteristic of cholera and ETEC infections.",

PT is also an A-B toxin with a single enzymatic subunit (S1) and a heteropentameric-binding subunit consisting of S2-S3, S2-S4 and S5 monomers, all encoded by a five gene operon. The B-pentamer preferentially binds to sialic-acid-containing host cell glycoproteins and delivers the S1 subunit to the target cell. The crystal structure of PT shows that the S1 polypeptide shares a common fold with the A1 subunits of the LT family (Stein et al. 1994b), and it similarly uses NAD to ADP-ribosylate a cysteine in the carboxyl terminus of the inhibitory alpha subunit (Gi\u03b1) of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex. This prevents its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors and its direct inhibitory interaction with host adenylate cyclase. These effects lead to inhibition of all signaling via Gi\u03b1-coupled receptors (Katada 2012) and increased levels of cAMP in target cells in response to other stimuli (Hsia et al. 1984; Melsom et al. 2014).",

PT similarly promotes airway colonization (Carbonetti et al. 2007) and contributes to significant immunomodulatory effects observed during infection (Connelly, Sun and Carbonetti 2012). All these toxins are potent mucosal adjuvants for coadministered antigens (Wilson et al. 1995; Liang and Hajishengallis 2010), effects that are attributable to both their enzymatic activities and receptor-binding properties (Schneider, Weiss and Miller 2007; Liang and Hajishengallis 2010).

EplBIIa was amplified with EplBIIaKpnF and EplBIIaApaR and cloned as a KpnI-ApaI fragment into pApaH6 to make pAEplBgpgph6, where the coding sequence for EplB is joined directly to a gly-pro-gly-pro-his6 linker. The EplAIIa gene was then amplified with EplAIIaAatF and EplAIIaSacR to add AatII and SacI flanking sites and cloned 3\u2032 of EplBgpgph6 in pEplBh6, to make the IPTG-inducible expression clone pAEplBgpgpH6EplA. The EalAB operon from LT-IIa isolate P393-F10 was cloned by adding an SphI site at the start of the coding sequence for the mature EalA subunit and an ApaI site at the end of the EalB gene by PCR with EalASphF and EalBApaR primers, followed by cloning into a derivative of the LT-IIb signal sequence vector pLDR5 (Jobling et al. 1997) that also has the ApaH6 tag. EplABgpgpH6 and EalABgpgpH6 holotoxins were purified by Talon affinity chromatography (as otherwise described by the manufacturer) from 1% Elugent (Calbiochem) extracts in Talon extraction buffer (0.3M NaHxP04, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl) of cells obtained from log-phase cultures induced with 0.4 mM IPTG and grown overnight at 30\u00b0C. Extracts were passed over a Talon resin column and washed with extraction buffer with 5 mM imidazole until the absorbance at A280 nm returned to baseline; bound proteins were eluted with Talon buffer with 150 mM imidazole and fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Toxin-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A) and further purified by HQ10 anion exchange chromatography on an AKTA system (GE Health Sciences) and eluted with a 0\u201360% gradient of buffer B (buffer A + 1M NaCl).

            "text": "I previously identified the genomic locus for the first type LT-IIc2 toxin in strain 442/2 by inverse PCR on a self-ligated PstI digest of chromosomal DNA. This 4 kb amplicon was used to determine the LT-IIc2 and immediate flanking gene sequences (Jobling and Holmes 2012). Here I determined the complete sequence of the inverse PCR product. This produced a further 2.3 kb of sequence that, in the genome, is 5\u2032 of the LT-IIc A gene (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, this sequence encoded the 3\u2032 end of another novel ADP-ribosylating toxin gene pair \u2013 the PstI site was internal to a partial open reading frame followed by a gene that encodes a homolog of the S1 catalytic subunit of PT (Fig. 1). The closest BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) match was to the PltBA (Sty1891-1890) PT-like toxin locus of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Spano, Ugalde and Galan 2008). PltBA was discovered as a pair of linked genes required for delivery of the cytotoxin CdtB to target cells, and with CdtB form a tripartite toxin (Song, Gao and Galan 2013). They are part of a small pathogenicity islet that appears to be phage-derived (Hodak and Galan 2013). I have designated this novel type II ETEC toxin locus eplBA, for E. coli pltBA-like toxin. This novel LT-IIc-associated toxin locus was followed by a three gene phage lysis cassette (holin-holin-lysin) the last of which encoded the gene previously identified as a lysin immediately 5\u2032 of the LT-IIc operon (Fig. 1) (Jobling and Holmes 2012). Since all LT-II loci also have homologous lysin genes upstream of their LT-II operons, it was possible that other LT-II isolates also encoded similar novel toxin loci. I have determined the complete sequence of the largest available plasmid subclone of the LT-IIa locus (pCP3727 containing a 3 kb EcoRI fragment; Fig. 1) (Pickett et al. 1986; Pickett, Weinstein and Holmes 1987). The cloned sequence begins with a similar three-gene lysis cassette that shows 90% identity to the LT-IIc sequence, but does not encompass the region that in LT-IIc encodes the novel toxin operon. I therefore used three sequential primer walks upstream of the LT-IIa genes in the original LT-IIa cosmid clone, A38 (Pickett et al. 1986), to determine 3 kb of sequence 5\u2032 of the holin genes, which showed that the LT-IIa locus also encodes a complete syntenic eplBA gene pair that are located 3\u2032 of a predicted phage antiterminator Q-gene (Fig. 1).",

Toxin gene expression independent of phage replication is supported by detection of EplBA and LT-II activity in extracts of overnight cultures of TE1 [A38] when these are added to CHO cells in tissue culture (Fig. 2). CHO cells normally grow as uniform monolayers (Fig. 2A), but respond to heat-labile enterotoxins by elongating (Guerrant et al. 1974) and to PT by forming tight clusters (Hewlett et al. 1983). Cosmid cell extract treated CHO cells grew in tight clusters with elongated morphology, showing both PT-like and LT-II activity (Fig. 2B). Pre-incubation of extract with toxin-specific rabbit-anti-serum neutralized the toxins and resulted in monolayers that formed clusters only (Fig. 2C, when pre-incubated with anti-LT-IIa), elongated cells only (Fig. 2D, when pre-incubated with anti-EplBA) or normal morphology when pre-incubated with both antisera (Fig. 2E). This demonstrates that the morphological changes are specific to each toxin; their effects are independent of each other, and that both toxins are naturally produced by cells carrying the cosmid clone. The CHO clustering phenotype is indistinguishable from that seen for CHO cells treated with purified PT (Fig. 2F; see also Hewlett et al. 1983). Hewlett et al. 1983 also showed that simultaneous addition of PT and CT to CHO cells causes them to both cluster and elongate, indicating that the effect of the two toxins was additive. Additionally, the Hewlett group found that treatment with both PT and CT had a synergistic effect on the amount of cAMP produced by intoxicated cells (Hewlett et al. 1982), and further that treatment with both toxins was required to observe a maximal cAMP response (Hsia et al. 1984). However, as these two toxins (PT and CT) are produced by different pathogens that colonize distinct mucosal environments (B. pertussis in the lung and Vibrio cholerae in the gut, respectively), this effect was not at the time biologically relevant. Here, I have shown for the first time that an enteric pathogen encodes and can simultaneously produce both types of ADP-ribosylating toxins that, together, are predicted to completely inactivate G-protein dependent control over cAMP production in target cells, by ADP-ribosylating and constitutively activating the stimulatory Gs\u03b1 subunit (by LT-II toxin) and ADP-ribosylating and inactivating the inhibitory Gi\u03b1 subunit (by PT-like toxins). Concurrent production of both toxins thus has the potential to increase disease severity by maximizing cAMP production leading to greater net fluid secretion (Sears and Kaper 1996).",

By analyzing the sequences at the cosmid vector-insert borders of original LT-IIa cosmid clone (A38), using vector-specific primers that flank the BamHI insertion site in the tet gene (Hohn and Collins 1980) I found that one end showed homology to predicted phage structural gene in a prophage-containing contig from an Arsenophonus genome (FN545185), and the other end of the A38 cosmid insert was homologous to the zntB gene located at 1.4 Mb in the MG1655 genome. ZntB is \u223c5 kb from the integration site for the defective Rac prophage of K12 (Kaiser and Murray 1979). The rac (recombination activation) locus was originally defined by mutations that suppressed the recombination deficiency phenotypes of recBC mutations (Low 1973), by activation of the recE gene encoded within the Rac prophage (Kaiser and Murray 1980). This data indicated that the LT-II locus is contained within a lambdoid-type prophage integrated at the same site as the Rac prophage in E. coli K12. Sequencing the complete insert in cosmid A38, showed that it begins with 5 kb of chromosomal DNA 99% identical to the K12 chromosomal genes 5\u2032 of the rac prophage locus\u2014zntB, ydaN, dpbA and ttcA. Following the integration site in ttcA is 30 kb of a lambdoid-type prophage. This appears to be a portion of a complete lambdoid prophage inserted at the K12 rac locus, but lacking \u223c15 kb of the right end that should encode many of the phage structural genes and the right chromosomal junction. As this project progressed, several complete E. coli genomes became available that encoded full-sized, but not toxin-encoding, prophages at the rac locus, and some of these (e.g. E. coli W, NC_0117664) had high homology to the right end of the cosmid insert. By a combination of long-range PCR and primer walking, I completed the sequence for the 16 kb missing region and confirmed that in the prototype LT-IIa strain SA53, the LT-IIa locus is chromosomally encoded within a 51 kb prophage inserted in the 5\u2032 end of the ttcA gene, in an identical location to the defective Rac prophage of K12 strains (Fig. 3).",

Predicted genes are annotated in Table 1 and shown graphically in the context of the prophage in Fig. 3. The majority of the genes in the first 9.5 kb of the prophage are encoded on the reverse strand and encode genes predicted to be involved in the lysis/lysogeny decision\u2014these loci begins with the predicted phage repressor (gene 12, most closely related to the dicA repressor gene of the K12 defective Qin prophage), followed by a kil homolog (Conter, Bouche and Dassain 1996) and predicted genes 6 and 5 involved in recombination (recE/recT). Predicted xis and integrase genes are the last before the chromosomal insertion site att, located within ttcA. The majority of the rest of the prophage genome is encoded on the sense strand and begins the early right operon with genes 13 and 14 encoding dicA-divergent transcriptional regulators (dicC and ydaT), followed in order by a group of phage replication genes (15\u201318) and a collection of likely non-essential genes (like the lambda Nin gene loci). This region ends with a functional though genetically unrelated homolog (pfam 06576, DUF1133, gene 31) of the lambda Q antiterminator gene. Following the Q-gene, beginning the phage late operon, are the toxin morons [beneficial regions, often encoding toxins, present in certain phages but absent in other related phages, (Hendrix et al. 2000; Juhala et al. 2000; Cumby, Davidson and Maxwell 2012a)] encoding EplBA and LT-IIa enterotoxins, separated by a three-gene lysis cassette 5\u2032 of the LT-IIa genes.

Here, eplBA are syntenic with the Shiga toxin (stx) genes in their enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) prophages, and in this context stx gene expression is upregulated during lytic induction of lysogens (Neely and Friedman 1998a,b). In EHEC infections this can occur during treatment with certain antibiotics in patients (Wong et al. 2000) and in animal models (Matsushiro et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2000), paradoxically triggering increased toxin expression by SOS-induction of prophages. This can lead to more severe disease or development of hemolytic uremic syndrome. I predict that production of both EplBA and LT-II toxins is similarly increased during lytic replication, and I am currently characterizing potential mechanisms of Rac-like prophage and toxin induction in type II ETEC. Expression data from the cosmid above and preliminary data with toxin 5\u2032 sequences cloned into promoter probe vectors indicates that even without prophage induction, the toxin genes are expressed at a detectable level from their own lytic-development independent promoters.",

It is thus possible that this LT-IIa prophage is now defective, and I have been unsuccessful in detecting plaque formation or Rac phage production from SA53. However, spontaneous excision of the prophage can be detected in some type II ETEC isolates by PCR. Outward-directed primers (RacrhsF3-right arm, and racIntF, left arm) from both ends of the prophage detect circularized phage DNA in stationary phase cultures of several LT-IIc isolates, but not SA53 (LT-IIa) (Fig. 4). The defective K12 Rac prophage can also excise (Evans, Seeley and Kuempel 1979), in a process recently found to be regulated by HN-S (Hong, Wang and Wood 2010), by recombination between direct repeats of 5\u2032-TTGTTCAGGTTGTATTGTTCTTTCTT-3\u2032, that flank the K12 locus and define the att site. Thus, the LT-IIc phages are functional for at least a portion of the lytic pathway, but we do not yet know of conditions that may induce the lytic cycle or if these are capable of replicating and forming functional phage particles. LT-IIc prophages must be significantly different from LT-IIa in their right arms, as five outward-directed LT-IIa-specific primers from 4 kb distal to the insertion site, down to only 170 bp 5\u2032 of the racrhsF3 positive primer, fail to give products with uspFR on any LT-IIc isolate DNA template (not shown). For comparison, there are few published studies describing Rac-like phages. The Sakai Rac prophage, Sp10 (Asadulghani et al. 2009) is reported to be competent for all phage functions except for the repressor which appears to be described as defective only because it lacks an SOS-induction domain. That study found Sp10 DNA was packaged into phage particles, and these could transduce marked phage genomes to some E. coli K12 strains, where they integrated specifically at the rac locus. Further work is warranted to understand the life cycle of Rac prophages in greater detail.",

Some complete E. coli genomes encode large prophages at the rac locus (inserted within ttcA and distal to uspF), including E. coli W (CP002185), the prototype EHEC strains EDL933 (NC_002655) and Sakai (NC_002695), EAEC O42 (FN554766) and avian pathogenic isolate APEC O1 (NC_008563). Although none of these prophage genomes encode similar enterotoxins, the O42 and O1 Rac prophages have morons following the structural genes that encode an iron transport system (SitABCD) and a cytolethal distending toxin (CdtABC), respectively. Following their lysis cassettes, these two phages encode trkG homologs, also found in the K12 Rac prophage. One Rac prophage in a 0.9 Mb contig from the draft genome for an avian E. coli B088 isolate (GG749133) does encode a different LT-II-like toxin, but no PT-like toxin locus. I will describe the LT-II toxin from this strain in a future publication. The E. coli W Rac prophage is most similar to the LT-IIa Rac prophage with 73% identity over the whole prophage genome. A global comparison shows more than half of these two prophage genomes are \u226590% identical, interspersed with regions of no or low DNA homology, indicative of module swapping (Casjens 2003; Grose and Casjens 2014). These non-homologous regions include portions of the recombination genes, key regulatory genes (dicA/dicC or cI/cro), replication genes and, significantly, the morons encoding EplBA and LT-IIa toxins. Notably, the moron flanking (Q and terminase subunit) and intervening (two holin) genes are well conserved although the third lysis cassette (endolysin) gene appears divergent. This analysis supports the concept of prophage evolution by recombination between homologous modules (Lima-Mendez, Toussaint and Leplae 2011; Menouni et al. 2015).",

The conserved Q-gene and holin gene-specific primers RacatermF and RacholinR, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information), used to amplify the LT-IIc2 locus from 442/2, also amplified similar sized (2.5\u20132.8 kb) products from all bar four of our 50 LT-II isolates (no products were obtained from three LT-IIc1 subtype strains and the lone LT-IIb strain).

I determined the DNA sequence of these PCR products for the other five of the six LT-IIc type strains (LT-IIc1, c3-c6, Jobling and Holmes 2012), and found that LT-IIc1, c2, c3 and c4 encoded highly similar eplBA loci. PCR with the RacatermF primer and a reverse primer internal to eplB (EplBR) was used to determine the frequency that eplBA toxin genes are associated with their LT-II locus for each of the 46 Q-holin PCR-positive LT-II strains in my collection. Thirty six type II ETEC isolates were PCR positive (all producing an \u223c1.1 kb product) using RacatermF and EplBR as the reverse primer, showing that the majority of LT-IIc-positive type II ETEC also encode eplBA loci.",

Each gene encodes a polypeptide with a well-defined 21 residue signal sequence ending with canonical cleavage sites (ala-xxx-ala)\u2014NANA-NA predicted to be cleaved after the second alanine; surprisingly, the major differences in the predicted protein sequences is due to a variable number of repeats directly following the predicted signal sequence\u2014comprising the sequence (NA)x(DVSS)y, where, for LT-IIa and LT-IIc1 through LT-IIc4 type strains, x is either 3 or 4 (which includes the signal peptide cleavage site from \u22124 to \u22121) and y is 2 for the LT-IIa-encoded EplB, and 6 or 7 for the LT-IIc1-c4-encoded EplB polypeptides. The number of repeats is responsible for the majority of differences between the loci, and excluding the repeats individual mature EplB proteins differ by at most 8 residues in 9 of 125 positions (Fig. 5). The mature EplB subunits from LT-II prophages thus form two major groups that differ at 3 of 4 residues (having either AKTG or\u2014TKRD signatures) in the center of the protein sequence, but this does not correlate with any specific LT-II type.

Strikingly, four subgroups of LT-IIc (c1, c2, c3 and c4) isolates are only associated with eplBA genes and constitute two-thirds (33/50) of all LT-II isolates. All LT-IIc1v and the single c6 isolates encode EalAB toxins. While 90% (9/10) of the EalAB-encoding loci are found in isolates of animal origin, 90% (9/10) of human type II ETEC isolates encode EplBA toxins. This tight and non-random linkage between EalAB/EplBA and LT-II type raises the questions as to how the various combinations might have arisen, and what the selective forces are that produce the tight linkage these two toxins. Both toxin loci fit the definitions of morons, as beneficial elements that usually have their own promoters and terminators (Cumby et al. 2012b). Here, they are inserted between highly conserved Q and terminase genes, and these are potential sites where homologous recombination can occur. The most likely way to generate recombinants is by superinfection, of a type II ETEC isolate with a resident rac prophage, by an active toxin-encoding phage with homologous Q, holin and terminase genes but different EplBA, EalAB or LT-II loci. Relaxed recombination specificity of phage recombination enzymes such as \u03bbred\u03b1\u03b2 or Rac recE/recT gene products (De Paepe et al. 2014) drives assortment of phage modules, and can occur even when the resident prophage is defective. Bobay, Touchon and Rocha (2013) finds that \u2018phages encoding their own recombination machinery have more mosaic genomes resulting from recent recombination events and have more diverse gene repertoires\u2019. Superinfection of stx lysogens by other stx phages has been demonstrated (Fogg et al. 2011), and in a comparative genomics study of stx phages, Smith concludes that \u2018recombination events between the host, phages and their remnants within the same infected bacterial cell will continue to drive the evolution of Stx phage variants\u2019 (Smith et al. 2012). These events have apparently occurred frequently enough in type II ETEC to generate the many combinations of LT-II toxin and Epl/Eal toxin types we find here, and suggest that toxin-encoding Rac phages are or have recently been able to produce infectious particles. The tight linkage of a PT-like toxin with an LT-II toxin within the same prophage indicates that the ability to produce both toxins provides the cell with a currently undetermined selective advantage in nature.",

            "text": "From a collection of 50 type II ETEC isolates, only four produced no PCR product using the Q and holin gene-specific primers. Three of these were LT-IIc1 isolates, one from Brazil (raw beef), one from Sri Lanka and one from Belgium (both bovine); these could simply be primer mismatches or they may be more divergent; they were not studied further. The single LT-IIb isolate also gave no product, and neither the isolate, strain 41, nor TE1 carrying the cosmid clone, D27, showed clustering activity on CHO cells, indicating that the LT-IIb strain does not produce a PT-like toxin. It does, however encode a lysin gene 5\u2032 of the LT-IIb locus (Jobling and Holmes 2012), indicating LT-IIb may also be encoded by a prophage. To verify this, I determined the prophage-encoding sequence of the single available LT-IIb cosmid clone D27; this cosmid appears chimeric (more than one contiguous genomic Sau3AI fragment inserts), and has a 10 kb Sau3AI fragment encoding the LT-IIb locus, joined to \u223c26 kb of unlinked chromosomal DNA (shown graphically in Fig. S4, Supporting Information). The 10 kb DNA fragment encompasses 5 kb of sequence 5\u2032 of the LT-IIb toxin genes, the LT-IIb genes and the remainder of the right arm, including the chromosomal integration site of the prophage. This shows that the LT-IIb locus is encoded within a prophage-like element, although the LT-IIb prophage is not found at the rac locus but is instead inserted into the serU tRNA gene, adjacent to the K12 yodB locus at 2.04 Mb in MG1655. Additionally, the LT-IIb prophage appears severely defective, missing the majority of the phage structural genes. It has only four genes (one hypothetical, a small terminase subunit and two phage tail fiber genes) following the LT-IIb gene before the predicted chromosomal insert site is found. Preceding the LT-IIb genes are homologs of the three gene lysis cassette, but no PT-like toxin locus. Instead, this region appears to have undergone rearrangement and/or duplication, having a second copy of a holin gene flanked by multiple tRNA genes. Phage-related sequences in the LT-IIb cosmid end with a partial gene showing homology to phage-encoded methylases. This gene is joined at a Sau3AI site to what appears to be an otherwise unlinked chromosomal DNA fragment, the ends of which encode \u2032xdhA and \u2032araE homologous sequences (Fig. S4, Supporting Information)that are separated by 26 kb in the K12 genome. Thus, strain 41, whose LT-IIb genes are nevertheless syntenic with their homolog and 5\u2032 flanking genes in the LT-IIa/c prophages, encodes LT-IIb (but no PT-like toxin) within a non-Rac prophage. This SerU-prophage is unique, degenerate and divergent from the Rac prophages that encode all other LT-II loci.",

            "text": "I have identified two new families of PT-like toxins, EplBA most closely related to PltBA, and EalAB most closely related to ArtAB, predicted to encode an enzymatic (ADP-ribosyltransferase) A subunit and a ligand-binding B subunit. While the gene order is reversed between the eplBA and ealAB families (as it is for pltBA and artAB), their corresponding A- and B polypeptides are clearly structurally and functionally related. The A subunits of both novel toxins show 66% overall identity with each other, having more conserved amino-terminal regions and more variable carboxyl-terminal halves (Fig. 6). Together with the A subunits of the other two-gene toxins from Salmonella (ArtAB and PltBA), they share extensive amino acid homology with the enzymatic S1 subunit of PT Fig. S5, Supporting Information). The more divergent carboxyl termini are likely a function of the need to preserve interaction with their similarly related but quite different B subunits. Crystal structures are available for PltBA (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) (in conjunction with its second enzymatic A subunit, CdtB) and PT (Stein et al. 1994b). These show that the carboxyl domains of the enzymatic subunits extend into and interact significantly with the pore of the B pentamer. The amino-termini of these catalytic subunits show very similar folds and key catalytic residues are conserved with PT-S1 for all EplA and EalA alleles (Fig. S5, Supporting Information). Variants of both EplBA and EalAB with glu-to-ala substitutions for the predicted catalytic glutamate residues (E113A and E115A, respectively) in their A polypeptides assemble into holotoxin normally, but these do not intoxicate host cells (data not shown), indicating that their enzymatic function is required to induce the morphological response. In contrast, comparison of each of these A subunit sequences with PltA shows that two enzymatically critical residues (homologs of PT-S1 R13 and H35), that are also conserved in all other A/S1 subunits, are variant in PltA (substituted by T and F, respectively; identified in Fig. 1 and Fig. S5, Supporting Information). These are likely to affect the catalytic activity of PltA, and it is possible that PltA has devolved into a mainly structural and not catalytic role in Typhi toxin. The critical function of PltA may then be coupling the CdtB toxin protein to the PltB subunit (ligand-binding component) in its unique tripartite (A2-B5) toxin complex (Song, Gao and Galan 2013). All other toxins with S1-like subunits are therefore likely to be functional ADP-ribosyltransferases, and like PT, modify and inactivate inhibitory G-proteins; this has been proven for ArtAB (Uchida et al. 2009). Further work is necessary to identify specific subtrates for EplBA and EalAB toxins.",

EplB polypeptides are unique in possessing a variable number of amino-terminal DVSS-repeats, of unknown function, but with the majority of EplB subunits having higher numbers of repeats, the repeat may have biological significance. Comparing EplB (from LT-IIc2) and EalB (from LT-IIc5), they show only 23% identity, matching at only 38 of 156/121 residues. Excluding the repeat region of EplB, this rises to 28% identity. EplB shows progressively decreasing percent identity compared to SubB, PltB and ArtB (40%, 33% and 25%, respectively) while the percent identity increases for EalB (26%, 29% and 68%, respectively) (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). All five B subunits show weak homology to PT-S2/S4 subunits. Features conserved in all B subunits include cysteine pairs that in the structures of PltB, SubB and PT-S2/S4 form disulfide bridges, and critical ligand-binding residues also identified in Fig. S6 (Supporting Information). These data indicate that these novel EplBA and EalAB toxins are structurally and functionally related to the PltBA and ArtAB toxins and may bind similar ligands. To permit further characterization of these novel toxins, I proceeded to engineer toxin clones with carboxyl-terminal his-tagged B subunits with which to over-expression and purify the holotoxins.",

I then appended a 6-his tag with a (gly-pro)2-encoding linker to the carboxyl terminus of EplB, and expressed this gene as an operon with native eplA (see methods). Essentially pure assembled EplBA holotoxin was affinity purified from cell lysates of TE1 [pAEplBgpgpH6EplA] by metal-chelate (Talon) chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. Holotoxin (A + B subunits) eluted first, and consisted of two bands by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8 lane 1), consistent with assembly into a multimeric complex of mature EplA (26 kDa) with tagged EplB-h6 (16 kDa). A second peak consisted of free B subunits (Fig. 8 lane 2). Intramolecular cross-linking of the purified EplBgpgpH6 B subunit only complex, followed by SDS-PAGE, showed a ladder of five bands consistent with the holotoxin consisting of a single A subunit associated with a homopentamer of B subunits (Fig. 8). For EplB, cross-linkers with larger spacers (DMP and DMS) more efficiently cross-linked all subunits of the pentamer, while for the control CT-B subunits, the cross-linker with the shortest spacer (DMA) was more efficient. This makes EplBA a bona fide member of the AB5 family of toxins. Assembly of the single EplB subunit into a pentamer is in agreement with the crystal structure of the tripartite A2B5 Typhi toxin (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) where the CdtB toxin is covalently coupled to PltA (via a disulfide bond), and PltA is non-covalently coupled to a pentamer of PltB subunits. Using a similar strategy, I cloned, expressed and purified his-tagged EalAB holotoxin (see methods). Both tagged variants of EplBA and EalAB holotoxin formed stable multimeric complexes that produced the characteristic clustering phenotype when added to CHO cells, indicating that the his-tag did not interfere with their ability to bind to and intoxicate target cells.",

CHO-15B cells show cell clustering by EplBA, EalAB or PT only when treated with 50\u201362 ng or greater, whereas CHO cells are susceptible to 125\u2013160 pg amounts of these toxins. I have determined the preferred glycans for the his-tagged EplB and EalB subunits using the version 5.1 glycan array at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (see www.functionalglycomics.org for complete data). This array has 610 unique mammalian glycans and the data show that these two toxins binds different but overlapping sets of glycans, with terminal sialated galactose sugars in common. While both EplB and EalB bind best to glycans with terminal gal-\u03b1(2-3)-Neu5Ac, EalAB also binds to glycans with terminal gal-\u03b1(2-3)-Neu5Gc. Figure 10 (top panels) shows the signals obtained for all glycans in the array for each toxin B subunit (left, EplB and right, EalB), and Fig. 10 (lower panel) shows the structures of representative top ten glycans bound by each toxin. The top ten ranking glycans bound by EplB and EalB are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively, along with the corresponding ranking for that glycan's binding by the other toxin.",

            "text": "Remarkably, EplB and EalB bind very similar glycans despite having only 23% identity in their mature subunits. Both toxins bind sialated galactose residues, as do PltB (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) and SubB (Byres et al. 2008). Overall, although they bind unique sets of glycans, half of the top ten glycans for one toxin are also in the top 20 glycans bound by the other toxin. Common among the top glycans for both toxins are terminal Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc units, although Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc linkages appear equally frequently; glycans with fucosylation of the GlcNAc residue are bound with increased affinity for both toxins (compare EplB glycans no. 1 and 5; EalB glycans ranked no. 9 and 27). Both EplB and EalB bind to Neu5Ac alone, ranked no. 20 and 23, respectively. The increased ability of EalB to bind Neu5Gc-containing glycans (that humans do not produce) correlates with the animal origin of the majority of the EalAB-positive type II ETEC isolates, although the ability of dietary Neu5Gc glycans to become functional receptors for SubAB on human intestinal cells (Byres et al. 2008) suggests that this may also happen with EalAB. Importantly, residues involved in ligand binding by the mature SubB subunit (S12, Y78) are conserved in both EplB and EalB. Additionally, EalB (but not EplB) has D8 in common with SubB that is critical for the SubB pentamer ability to bind Neu5Gc (Byres et al. 2008). However, EplB can still bind Neu5Gc glycans but with apparently lower affinity\u2014four of its top 30 glycans contain Neu5Gc although they rank towards the lower end of this group, whereas EalB has 3 Neu5Gc-containing glycans in its top 15. EplB and EalB appear to be more promiscuous towards the sialic acid group than both PltB and SubB, which are much more specific for Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, respectively. Differences between toxins in their preferred ligands may result in altered patterns of target cell intoxication and likely lead to differences in host response to each of these toxins. This could include differences in immunomodulatory properties with consequences for the infection process or their potential use a novel adjuvants. Further work in this area is warranted.",

            "text": "I showed that the genes encoding the heat-labile enterotoxins of type II ETEC are present within a lambdoid prophage inserted at the rac locus, that in E. coli K12 strains encodes a defective prophage. Although I have yet to detect production of plaque-forming phage, enterotoxigenicity of type II ETEC can be added to the growing list of virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria that are phage-encoded and may be acquired by lysogenic conversion (Casas and Maloy 2011). Almost all (46/50) of these LT-II toxin prophages in my collection also encoded one of two novel, two-gene PT-like toxins (EplBA and EalAB) that have homologs in S. enterica prophages found in the Typhi serovar (PltBA, encoded by a degenerate and defective remnant prophage) and in the Typhimurium serovar DT104 phage type lineage (ArtAB, encoded within a functional prophage). The location within the prophage of these dual toxin operons (EplBA or EalAB and LT-IIa/c), like the Shiga toxin genes of EHEC prophages, indicates that their expression is likely to be increased during lytic induction of the prophage, being the first genes to be expressed by Q-directed antitermination that drives synthesis of the late structural and lysis genes of the phage particle. This is the first description of a pathogen producing two ADP-ribosylating toxins that are predicted to target both arms of host cell control over adenylate cyclase, by modifying and constitutively activating the stimulatory G-protein Gs\u03b1 (CT/LT-I/LT-II action) and additionally removing inhibitory control by modifying and inactivating Gi\u03b1 (PT-like action). The extremely tight linkage of LT-II toxins with a PT-like toxin in the vast majority of LT-II isolates strongly implies that this combination is biologically advantageous to the host strain. Simultaneous production of both toxins thus has the potential to synergistically increase cAMP production by intoxicated cells. In addition to affecting cAMP levels in intoxicated cells, both toxins, through their modification of both stimulatory and inhibitory host cell G\u03b1 subunits, are likely, like cholera and PT, to have strong immunomodulatory effects on the host cell mucosal tissue, including both cytokine production by target enterocytes (Soriani, Bailey and Hirst 2002; Wang et al. 2013) and immune responses by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Elson and Ealding 1984; Queen and Satchell 2013; Mattsson et al. 2014).",

Inset box under lanes 9 and 10 shows a contrast-enhanced region of upper portion of the same lanes in order to more readily identify the upper bands. Proven pentameric CTB and EplB both show the monomers and four cross-linked forms consistent with a pentameric assembly of monomers.",

Tissue culture clustering assays of serial dilutions of purified his-tagged or pertussis toxin on wt CHO cells or glycosylation-deficient CHO-15B cells; toxin titers are expressed as log10 of the clustering units per \u03bcg. Above each bar is given the minimal amount of toxin required to observe clustering on the respective cell line. The almost three log decrease in toxin titer on CHO-15B cells indicates that sialated glycoproteins are the major functional ligands for all these toxins.",
