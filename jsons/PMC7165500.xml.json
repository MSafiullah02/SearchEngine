            "text": "Diarrhoea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal dairy and beef calves. Substantial economic loss occurs as a result of increased morbidity and mortality, treatment costs and reducing growth rates. Neonatal enteritis in calves is a common problem all over the world (de la Fuente et al., 1998; Fecteau et al., 2001; Bell et al., 2002). The diarrhoeal syndrome has a complex aetiopathogenesis, because various infectious agents, either alone or in combination, may be associated with field\u2019s outbreaks. In addition, environmental, management and nutritional factors influence the severity and outcome of the disease. Rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the four major pathogens associated with neonatal calf diarrhoea worldwide (Reynolds et al., 1986; Klingenberg and Svensson, 1998; de la Fuente et al., 1998; Fecteau et al., 2001; Bell et al., 2002; Jay et al., 2004). In the USA, rotavirus and coronavirus were found together in 35% of the diarrhoea cases in beef calves (Maes et al., 2003). The significance of rotavirus and coronavirus as a major cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea has also been reported all over world (Bellizoni et al., 1990). de la Fuente et al. (1998) reported that neonatal calf diarrhoea accounts for approximately 75% of the mortality of dairy calves under 3 week old. Enterotoxigenic E. coli has two groups of virulence factors: (i) fimbriae (pili) and (ii) enterotoxins. K99 and/or F41 fimbriae mediate adherence to the ileum and are found on most calf ETEC (Franck et al., 1998). Calf ETEC produces heat\u2010stable enterotoxin a (STa), which causes hypersecretion in the gut lumen (Butler and Clarke, 1994; Kuhnert et al., 2005). Shiga toxin\u2010producing E. coli (STEC) produces two types of Shiga toxins; one is immunogically similar to the Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae and the other is immunogically distinct from S. dysenteriae Shiga toxins (Karmali, 1989). Vero cytotoxin\u2010producing E. coli of different serotypes has become a major concern in human and animal diseases in different countries in the last few years (Beutin et al., 1993; Wieler et al., 1998; Beutin, 2006). Several authors (Bouzari et al., 2005; Osek, 2005) described the prevalence of cytolethal distending toxin genes among STEC isolated from humans and animals (Janka et al., 2003; Thot et al., 2003; Bielaszewska et al., 2004; Wagner et al., 2004; Scott et al., 2006).",

Klingenberg and Svensson (1998) reported that group A rotavirus was detected by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and RNA\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 14/33 (43.8%) of the samples from scouring calves and 1/30 (3.7%) of the samples from non\u2010scouring calves.",

Most of the available antigen detection ELISAs were designed and licenced for use in detecting human rotavirus. A multiplex PCR which detects genes encoding intimin, K99, F41, Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) has been developed. In recent years, ELISAs and PCR are being increasingly used to detect enteropathogens in faeces samples from calves (China et al., 1996).",

Rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidium ssp. and ETEC are the four major pathogens associated with neonatal calf diarrhoea worldwide (Reynolds et al., 1986;Klingenberg and Svensson, 1998; de la Fuente et al., 1998; Bell et al., 2002). In this study, we detected enterogenic E. coli, Enterococcus ssp., Salmonella ssp., rotavirus and coronavirus in faeces taken from the diarrhoeic calves, and only E. coli was isolated in faeces taken from the healthy calves. Mix infections were detected in some diarrhoeic calves in our study. In addition, no bacteria or virus was detected in 18.29% of the diarrhoeic calves (n = 15). This percentage of negative results is similar to the results of earlier reporters (Reynolds et al., 1986; de la Fuente et al., 1998;McDonough et al., 1994).

More recently, AEEC and STEC have also been identified as causes of diarrhoea and dysentery in calves (Mainil et al., 1990; Butler and Clarke, 1994; Franck et al., 1998). Mainil et al. (1990) reported that STa, K99 and F41 genes were the most common (67.4%) strain among E. coli isolated from calves. Yuste et al. (2006) also reported that the percentages of enteropathogenic E. coli strains astA\u2010 were positive in 15.6% of healthy cattle. K99 (18.9%), F41 (18.9%), STa (18.9%), Stx1 (13.5%), Stx2 (5.4%) and intimin (8.1%) were common strains among E. coli isolated from the diarrhoeic calves detected in this study. Calves are more suspectible to ETEC during the first 3 or 4 days of their lives, and the organisms are often investigated only in calves aged 7 days or less (de la Fuente et al., 1998). The bacteriological diagnosis of neonatal calf diarrhoea because of E. coli should focus not only on ETEC strains but also on Stx\u2010 and Ae\u2010positive E. coli strains (Wieler et al., 1998). Not only K99, F41, Stx1, Stx2 and STa were generally identified in the calves with diarrhoea between 2\u2010 and 7 days old but also intimin was detected in calves with diarrhoea over 10 days old in this study. Virulence factors of intimin and Shiga toxins were isolated commonly from faeces of healthy calves (Orden et al., 2002). Bielaszewska et al. (2004) and Kuhnert et al. (2005) reported that STEC were isolated from faeces of animals. In this study, 18 E. coli (100%), K99 (16.6%) and intimin (55.5%) genes from faeces samples of healthy calves were identified by PCR (Table 3). However, no STa, Stx1 or Stx2 was detected in the healthy calves. We were observed that healthy calves are the most important reservoir of E. coli. Leomil et al. (2003) indicated that the frequency of carriage of Stx was higher in diarrhoeic calves (20%) than in non\u2010diarrhoeic calves. We found that the frequency of carriage of Stx1 (13.5%) and Stx2 (5.4%) was high in the diarrhoeic calves, but no Stx1 or St2 was detected in non\u2010diarrhoeic calves.",

However, out of 11 ELISA positive (for E. coli, K99) diarrhoeic calves, only four (calves numbered as: 5, 7, 12, 60) were positive in PCR. Both the rate of E. coli K99 and F41 was found to be 18.91% in same faeces samples of diarrhoeic calves by PCR. While E. coli K99 in three faeces samples of healthy calves was positive by PCR, one faeces sample was positive by ELISA.",

            "text": "Rotavirus and coronavirus infections are well\u2010known causes for acute diarrhoea in neonatal calves (Klingenberg and Svensson, 1998), but subclinical infections also occur frequently (Chinsangram et al., 1995; Erdo\u011fan et al., 2003). Rotaviruses are, among the enteropathogenic agents, more commonly associated with neonatal diarrhoea in calves (Falcone et al., 1999). de la Fuente et al. (1998) found that rotavirus was the most commonly detected agents (42.7%). Erdo\u011fan et al. (2003) reported that the prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus in neoanatal calves with diarrhoea was determined by ELISA, 26.9% and 1% respectively. However, Ekik and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk (2002) detected rotavirus in the faeces of 16.21% of the diarrhoeic calves by antigen ELISA. In this study, a total of 15 samples for rotavirus (18.2%) and 11 samples for coronavirus (13.4%) were positive in diarrhoeic calves by antigen ELISA. In addition, both of rotavirus and coronavirus were found in three faeces samples in diarrhoeic calves (calves numbered as; 2, 16, 54). There was no rotavirus or coronavirus in positive samples in healthy neonatal calves by antigen ELISA. The results indicated that rotavirus and coronavirus may be important in the aetiology of diarrhoea in neonatal calves that over 7 days old. In this study, this percentage of rotavirus and coronavirus in diarrhoeic calves was similar to the results reported by some researchers (Chinsangram et al., 1995; Falcone et al., 1999; Ekik and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, 2002; Erdo\u011fan et al., 2003). In contrast, the percentage of rotavirus in this study was lower than the results of de la Fuente et al. (1998). These differences in incidence rate among the studies may be attributed to different diagnostic methods used, farm management practices exercised in different regions and related to ageing of calf, because coronavirus and rotaviruses were detected in calves with diarrhoea aged between 7\u2010 and 30 days old in our study. In addition, the most of calves with diarrhoea (n = 47) were 7 days old or less.",

Especially, K99, F41, STa and Shiga toxins (Stx1\u20132) were found as the most common virulence gene markers of E. coli strains isolated from diarrhoeic calves.
