The two regions of the world with highest mortality rate for gastric cancer are Asia and Latin America accounting for almost two thirds of all gastric cancer deaths2. Within the US, ethnic minorities, e.g., Asians, Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, experience an incidence almost twice as high as non-Hispanic Whites3. Some Asian countries, such as Japan, have nation-wide screening programs for early detection of gastric cancer, whereas most other high-risk countries, such as Latin American countries, do not have such programs, nor does the US for ethnic minorities4\u20136. Although Helicobacter pylori (HP) is an established cause of gastric cancer7, eradication of HP in general asymptomatic populations has not been advised, because of the large number of persons already infected in high risk populations (>90%), high reinfection rates in endemic areas8, antibiotic resistance, high cost of the treatment9 and the increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with HP-negative/eradicated individuals10\u201312. Thus, new strategies for gastric cancer prevention are warranted and may help reduce health disparities, mainly in the most affected and underdeveloped regions of the world13. All considered identification of new HP variants potentially useful to predict gastric cancer risk will be invaluable not only for vaccine development, but also to target antibiotic treatment to high-risk individuals.",

A number of HP virulence factors have been identified, but it is now clearly established that cagA and the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island (cagPAI) play a central role in the pathogenesis of HP-associated diseases16,17. The cagPAI consists of a 40 kb chromosomal DNA and is present in approximately 95% of East Asian isolates, compared to 60% of low-risk Western isolates18\u201321. These genes encode cytotoxins and components of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) that acts as a molecular syringe injecting bacterial macromolecules into host cell cytosol19. This ultimately leads to sustained IL-8 production, inflammation, proliferation and morphological changes of gastric epithelial cells which underlie HP-induced gastric premalignant and malignant pathologies19. However, the presence of cagA (a marker of cagPAI) does not predict clinical outcomes in high-risk populations since the majority of HP are cagA positive strains, and among the infected subject less than 3% develop gastric cancer.",

A number of the cagPAI genes are homologous to type IV secretion system genes (T4SS) of Agrobacterium, VirB1-11, VirD4, and VirE1. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens model, the T4SS is composed of 13 proteins, which span both bacterial and host cell membranes23\u201326. Because of the relevance of cagPAI in the biological activities of HP that lead to tissue damage, microvariabilities in cagPAI genes other than cagA are likely to play an important role in determining HP virulence. In this work we aim to study the microvariability of all the cagPAI genes with the exception of cagY, for which we limited our analysis to 339 nucleotides at the 3' end of the genes encoding for the last carboxyl terminal 113 amino acids, CagYc)27. The present study is meant to extend our previous work based on 454 sequencing28 by including new cases with premalignant lesions, and by studying additional cagPAI genes using a newer sequencing platform to increase the power of SNP detection. Data from the present work have been included in a phylogenetic analysis of Latin American HP strains29. We performed a comprehensive screening of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in relation to gastric histopathology in order to identify variants with potential predictive value for clinical outcome, which warrant further validation in larger samples as well as separate functional analyses.",

In the current work we confirmed the absence of polymorphism in Y position 58 and the presence of N58D polymorphism. We also observed the E59K polymorphism but we did not find association with either IM or GC in our populations. It should be noted that there was a major difference between our current and previous studies28 in the composition of geographical origins of the samples. Our former study included Colombian while the current study included Venezuelan strains; this is relevant considering our recent report where we document adaption of HP genome to different Latin American populations37.

In the same vein, the sample was too small to assess combinations of several potentially interesting variants. Also, our study did not include Asian strains that present marked differences in the CagA EPIYA region, and thus our results do not apply to Asian strains. Furthermore, our sequencing platform HiSeq was not suitable to analyze long repeat regions such as those in cagY, which are rather common in Hp bacterial genome. That is a major reason why we limited cagY analysis to its conserved region (Yc). Finally, our data were exclusively based on cultivable HP from gastric biopsies. Little is known as to whether bacteria that are easy to grow in vitro are genetically different from those that are difficult to grow in vitro but able to survive in the human stomach for extended periods of time.",

A consensus sequence was determined for cagA (HP0547), cagC (HP0546), cagE (HP0544), cagF (HP0543), cagI (HP0540), cagL (HP0539), c-terminal sequence of cagY (HP0527) (339 nucleotides at the 3\u2019 end of the genes encoding for the last carboxyl terminal 113 amino acids of CagY, cagYc)28, cagX (HP0528), cag\u03b3 (HP0523), and single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions and deletions were identified for each gene. For the analysis of cagA gene an additional strategy was used to better analyze the EPIYA and CM motifs (C-MET motif mediate CagA multimerization and membrane targeting)30,31. Illumina reads of the cagA gene were extracted and realigned by the \u201cde novo assemble\u201d option of the same software. To exclude potential artifacts in sequencing and to enrich variants with clinical relevance, we selected a total of 520 non-synonymous variants with at least 7.5% frequency in the HP isolates we included in the analysis or with a minimum of 5 isolates with the variant allele. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P = 0.05/520 = 9.6\u00d710\u22125) was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. The variant alleles were determined using strain 26695 as reference. When more than one variant resulted in substitution of the same amino acid, we also analyzed the frequencies of the combined amino acid variant. We used non-atrophic gastritis as the control group to compare frequencies of variants in IM and GC groups or a combined group with the two pathologies, and genotypes at a given locus were dichotomized, a selected variant vs. all other genotypes. P-values for differences in allelic frequencies between the control and IM/GC combined or separately were determined by the Fisher\u2019s exact test (2-sided). We also computed odds ratios (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) for these gastric pathologies using logit estimators to obtain the CI even for the variants with zero frequencies in any category. For the variants that showed an unadjusted Fisher P-value of <0.05, we further tested linear trends of their frequencies across the three histological groups, control, IM and GC, using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. These analyses were performed by SAS version 9. The effect of DNA polymorphisms on the predicted proteins was evaluated with a bioinformatics tool: SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) http://sift.jcvi.org53.",
