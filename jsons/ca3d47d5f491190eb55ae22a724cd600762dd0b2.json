To determine if other stool-shed viruses are similarly affected, stool specimens previously examined by electron microscopy and observed to contain virus particles were reexamined after 6-10 years of storage at -70\u00b0C to -85\u00b0C. The stools contained virus particles of different morphological types, including astrovirus, small round structured virus, adenovirus, and rotavirus as well as calicivirus. Also reexamined were stools containing coronavirus-like particles and T = 19 virus-like particles. Characteristic virus particles, including calicivirus particles, were recognized in all the stools reexamined. The results indicate that long-term storage of stools at ultralow temperatures does not present a significant problem for the morphological identification of stool-shed viruses.

With EM, a stool specimen can be scanned for a number of morphologically distinct viruses in a single examination. EM does not require cell culture and is not confined, as are other methods, to detecting viruses with common antigens or similar genomes. Specimens must, however, be examined one at a time with EM. This can be time-consuming if many specimens are to be examined. When large numbers of specimens are involved, as frequently happens during outbreaks of illness, proper storage of the specimens is essential.",
