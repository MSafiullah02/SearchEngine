The time between the first symptoms and the manifestation of hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to affect prognosis of these patients. Therefore several groups have included in their definition the time frame between the onset of symptoms and start of encephalopathy. The definition of the US ALF study group uses the term ALF as an umbrella and differentiates between three subgroups: hyperacute, acute, and subacute. The time between first symptoms and encephalopathy in hyperacute ALF is 7 days, in acute ALF it is 8\u201328 days, and in subacute ALF it is 5\u201326 weeks [2\u20134] (Fig. 25.1). More generally, ALF can be defined as a severe liver injury, clinically characterized by coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy within 26 weeks of symptom onset in previously healthy subjects [5]. Owing to loss of hepatic function, ALF results in hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure within a short period of time.\n\n",

Patients presenting with early grades of hepatic encephalopathy in ALF (independent of etiology) have usually a more favorable outcome than those with established stupor or coma [9].

Due to the implementation of routine vaccination, the incidence of fulminant HBV has been decreased. In fulminant HBV infection, antiviral therapy with lamivudine, entecavir, or tenofovir has been proven efficient and safe, with significant reduction of HBsAg concentrations [18, 19] (Table 25.2). Reactivation of HBV or infection with highly replicative HBV harboring precore and core-promoter gene mutations become a more important cause of ALF [20, 21]. Virus reactivation is associated with a much higher risk of ALF than novel acute HBV infection, and antiviral prophylaxis should be administered to HBsAg-positive patients who are about to receive immunosuppressive therapy [22].",

Additionally, glutamate transporter on astrocytes (GLT-1 and GLAST) and neurons (EAAC1) limit the expression of glutamate in the neuronal cleft. After uptake of glutamate in astrocytes via GLT-1, it is transformed into glutamine. Ammonia downregulates GLT-1 expression on astrocytes, and this results in higher and prolonged extracellular glutamate concentrations in patients with ALF. Additionally, there is evidence that the glutamate receptors are differentially expressed during ALF and thus dysregulation of the glutamate system is one of the important determinants for hepatic encephalopathy during ALF [61, 62].",

The liver is the main source of complement (e.g., C3 and C5) production. As a consequence of lower complement levels, activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and complement-mediated opsonization is reduced. Therefore phagocytosis and killing of polymorphonuclear cells is inhibited in patients with ALF. Through the portal circulation, bacterial toxins are regularly brought to the liver tissue that is cleared by the resident Kupffer cells of the liver. In ALF there is a correlation between hepatic damage and Kupffer cell dysfunction. Additionally, Kupffer cells are a major source of cytokines, and their dysregulation also contributes to the impaired immune response. Defective lymphocyte function has been attributed to impaired interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in these patients. Thus the defect in immune response can be explained on different levels of the immune system [6, 69].",

Owing to the diminished liver function, higher rates of infections and coagulation disorders are observed. Cerebral edema, infections, and renal failure are important clinical complications limiting survival. For risk stratification in patients with ALF and subsequent hepatic encephalopathy, serum ammonia levels can be used. Advanced cerebral dysfunction is expected at serum ammonia levels of 124 \u03bcmol/L or higher.",

Severe liver injury leads to oxidative stress and depletion of ATP stores favoring necrosis, whereas sufficient cellular ATP resources are required for the execution of apoptosis. As necrosis is associated with an inferior outcome as compared with apoptotic cell death, the discrimination of the cell death mode in ALF might be a novel prognostic tool for instant identification of patients requiring transplantation. Moreover, the molecular cell death mechanisms in ALF are promising targets for future research aiming at reducing hepatocellular death without inhibiting liver regeneration.",
