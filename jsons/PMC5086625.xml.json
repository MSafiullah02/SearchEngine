            "text": "Ubiquitin is a small, 8.5 kDa protein composed of 76 amino acids expressed in different tissues and present in different subcellular compartments. Post-translational attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins, namely ubiquitination, alters the function, location, or trafficking of the protein, or targets it for destruction by the 26S proteasome. The ability of ubiquitin to form structurally and functionally distinct polymers greatly increases the complexity of ubiquitination. Ubiquitin has a globular shape with the last four C-terminal residues (LRGG) extending from the compact structure. C-terminal glycine (G) can be covalently conjugated to proteins by isopeptide linkage to the \u03b5-amino group of lysine (K) residues or less frequently to the N-terminal \u03b1-amino group or the thiol group of cysteine residues. Ubiquitin itself contains eight amino groups to which another ubiquitin molecule can be conjugated: the \u03b5-amino groups of seven K residues (K6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48 and 63) and the \u03b1-amino group of the N-terminal methionine residue. All of the eight ubiquitin chain types are present in the cell, among which the K48- and K63-linked chains are most abundant and the best described. K48-based linkages lead mainly to the proteasome-mediated degradation of the ubiquitinated protein, while K63-based chains control primarily protein endocytosis, trafficking, and enzyme activity [1,2,3,4].",

Ubiquitin is activated in an ATP-dependent manner, when a high-energy thioester bond is formed between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and an internal cysteine residue of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. Activated ubiquitin is then transferred onto the active site cysteine of one of E2-conjugating enzymes. Finally, the formation of an isopeptide bond is catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases, which link ubiquitin moieties to target proteins or elongate a polyubiquitin chain (Figure 1) [5,6,7].",

The E3 ubiquitin ligases determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination, and the diversity of the cellular functions of ubiquitination is reflected in the existence of hundreds of different E3s in mammals, compared with roughly thirty-five E2s and only two E1s in humans. E3 enzymes are currently classified into three main families with different structural and functional characteristics: the homologous to E6AP C-terminus (HECT) domain family of ubiquitin ligases, the cullin-really interesting new gene (RING) family of ubiquitin ligases, and the U-box containing ubiquitin ligases [2,3,9]. E3 ligases can be single- or multi-subunit enzymes; in the second case ubiquitin-binding and substrate binding domains reside on separate polypeptides brought together by adaptor proteins.",

Such a treatment not only blocks the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), but also depletes the cellular pool of free ubiquitin, affecting many of the cellular pathways involving ubiquitin. Functional UPS is important for the replication of major human pathogens such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, hepadnaviruses, adenoviruses, influenzaviruses, retroviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses and rotaviruses [14]. UPS components are upregulated in primary human airway epithelial cells infected by influenza A virus (IAV) [17]. Proteasome inhibition leads to sequestration of incoming IAV in the cytoplasmic compartments and blocks productive viral entry [18,19].",

            "text": "Ubiquitination also plays an important role in innate immunity to IAV. The host antiviral factor cyclophilin A targets the influenza matrix protein (M1) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation [20], while zinc finger antiviral protein ZAPL promotes ubiquitination and degradation of viral polymerase subunits PA and PB2 [21]. Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a potent antiviral protein which inhibits IAV cytosolic entry [22,23], is downregulated by ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4 (NEDD4), the depletion of which boosts cell resistance to IAV infection [24]. Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins, which belong to the RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, counteract IAV replication. For example, TRIM25 is a key mediator in antiviral retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) signaling [25] (described in Section 7). TRIM22 and TRIM32 ubiquitinate nucleoprotein (NP) and viral polymerase subunit PB1, respectively [26,27], targeting them for degradation. IAV proteins indirectly modulate ubiquitination events to evade immune responses and support virus replication. For example, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) inhibits TRIM25 [28]. Expression of viral hemagglutinin (HA) in cells causes phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IFN receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) which then undergoes proteasome- and lysosome-dependent degradation [29]. Reduction of IFNAR1 on cell surface attenuates IFN signaling and innate antiviral responses.",

The importance of priming is signified by the low infection rate in acid-mediated bypass experiments (in which the virus enters the cytoplasm by direct fusion at the plasma membrane) compared to infection by the endocytic route [37]. In late endosomes (LEs) or mature macropinosomes, viral envelope glycoprotein HA undergoes an irreversible, low pH (5.5\u20135.0)-induced conformational change that activates its membrane fusion activity [38]. The viral envelope fuses with the limiting membrane of the endosome to form a fusion pore, through which the particle gains access to the cytosolic milieu for the first time during entry.",

The itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) has been shown to promote IAV escape from LEs via the ubiquitination of M1 [39]. Uncoating is inhibited by the depletion of cullin 3 (Cul3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes endosome maturation [40,41]; the defects in the LE compartments in Cul3-depleted cells were reflected by a highly vacuolated LE/lysosome (LY) phenotype with large spherical, Rab7-positive, fluid-filled endosomes [40]. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) mediate the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) [42,43]. Depletion of components of the ESCRT machinery results in fewer ILVs and accumulation of cargo in endosomes with abnormal morphology [44,45,46].",

Ubiquitination at K184 is counteracted by a host deubiquitinase USP11 [54]. Ubiquitination of viral polymerase and UPS activity promotes the activity of the polymerase, and ubiquitin expression leads to accumulation of vRNA, complementary RNA (cRNA) and viral mRNA [55]. Nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) of IAV binds to aminoacyl-tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) which protects AIMP2 from K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. AIMP2 promotes nuclear export of vRNPs and IAV replication at late steps of infection. It also counteracts ubiquitination of M1 at K242 and subsequent proteasomal degradation by an unknown mechanism [56]. Modification of the same M1 K242 by a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is crucial for nuclear export of newly produced vRNPs and viral morphogenesis [57], which could explain AIMP2-mediated enhancement of IAV replication at late steps of infection [56].",

However, if clearance of misfolded proteins is insufficient, they can shape sizable aggregates that interfere with cell homeostasis [74]. How does HDAC6 ZnF-UBP recruit protein aggregates? Ouyang et al. [63] showed that unanchored ubiquitin chains with various lengths are found in misfolded protein bundles. Unanchored ubiquitin chains are generated in situ by Ataxin-3, an aggregate-associated, polyubiquitin-editing DUB that cuts within ubiquitin chains. Ataxin-3 exposes C-terminal diglycine motifs that serve as recognition tags for protein waste. These tags recruit HDAC6 and facilitate subsequent dynein-mediated transport of the aggregate to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (Figure 3). How do the ubiquitin chains, despite being unanchored, remain associated with the aggregates? One possibility is via interaction of the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch with exposed hydrophobic cores of the misfolded proteins. In this scenario, ubiquitin chains would become trapped inside a net of aggregated polypeptides and cannot diffuse away.",

Proteasomes do not degrade aggresomes but tend to congregate in their vicinity [12,76]. A proteasome-associated K63-specific DUB called Poh1 is necessary for aggresome clearance because it produces unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains which activate HDAC6 [12]. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a binding partner of HDAC6 [77] and contributes to aggresome clearance by stimulating Poh1 to produce unanchored ubiquitin chains [76]. Ubiquitin binding to HDAC6 regulates the repressive Hsp90\u2013heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) complex, the dissociation of which leads to activation of HSF1 and expression of cellular chaperones [58]. In Poh1-deficient cells, aggresome clearance is inhibited but can be restored by microinjecting unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin [12]. Toxic protein aggregates are processed by autophagy after being sequestered to the MTOC, and HDAC6 regulates the formation of a cortactin-dependent F-actin network that is interspersed among such protein aggregates. This activity stimulates autophagosome-LY fusion and aggresome degradation [61] (Figure 3).",

Following viral fusion at LEs, these ubiquitin moieties are exposed to the cytoplasm and attract HDAC6 to the sites of fusion on the surface of LEs. HDAC6 in turn binds to the capsid, which during endocytic transit has been broken down into M1 dimers [81], and links it to cytoskeleton motors dynein and myosin. This generates a shearing force that disassembles the capsid and releases the vRNPs into the cytoplasm (Figure 3). Point mutations H1094/H1098 or W1116 of the mouse HDAC6 ZnF-UBP inactivate ubiquitin binding to HDAC6 and block uncoating [66,82]. By blocking HDAC6 binding to dynein, dynein and myosin activity, or by depolymerizing microtubules or actin, uncoating is diminished [66]. It is likely that DUBs assist in the process of IAV uncoating. This is because DUBs such as ataxin-3 [63] and Poh1 [12] that generate unanchored ubiquitin chains are required for HDAC6-mediated aggresome processing.",

To ensure proper assembly, viruses remove uncoating factors during the late stage of infection [30]. The IAV strategy is dually cunning; it not only inactivates HDAC6 but also induces a stable microtubule network that promotes viral progeny egress and budding. During replication, IAV cleaves off the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP by activating caspase 3 [83], which prevents premature capsid uncoating. HDAC6 inactivation combined with virus replication increases acetylation of microtubules. Acetylation promotes the association of microtubules with kinesin-1 and dynein motors which regulate endosome trafficking [84,85,86,87]. Cells lacking HDAC6 deliver EGFR prematurely to LE/LY compartments, resulting in faster EGFR degradation [88]. Hyperacetylated microtubules promote IAV genome egress via Rab11-positive recycling endosomes [89,90,91,92] (Figure 4). Although hyperacetylated microtubules appear to play no role in IAV uncoating [66], we cannot exclude the possibility that kinesin, in addition to dynein and myosin, contributes to the uncoating process.",

These large multiprotein complexes are formed rapidly in response to PAMPs and serve as scaffolds to activate caspase 1, which processes pro-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, respectively, which can then be secreted [95,107]. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family member NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in defense against infection with IAV and many other viruses including hepatitis C virus [107,108,109,110,111]. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. For example, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)/breast cancer 2 (BRCA2)-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) deubiquitinates NLRP3, and pharmaceutical inhibition of DUBs restricts inflammasome activation [79,112,113], whereas E3 ubiquitin ligases LUBAC and TRIM33 promote inflammasome assembly [114,115]. In bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) depleted of HDAC6, there is a significant boost in caspase 1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion as a response to NLRP3 activation. HDAC6 ZnF-UBP interaction with NLRP3 inhibits inflammasome activation [79], suggesting that unanchored ubiquitin regulates this pathway. NS1, the major suppressor of the IAV IFN response, antagonizes both TRIM25/Riplet-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and NLRP3 inflammasome activation which underscores their significance in anti-viral immunity [28,108,116].",

A few of such virus-incorporated host proteins have been described, especially in retroviruses [117]. IAV virions produced in different hosts contain a wide range of host-derived proteins as detected by mass spectrometry [118,119]. Among these are ubiquitin, cytoskeletal proteins, and tetraspanin cluster of differentiation (CD) 81 [118,119,120]. The biological significance of these non-viral proteins is largely unknown; encapsidated enzymes, for example, could play a regulatory role in IAV entry. In order to better understand how HDAC6 contributes to IAV uncoating, the following aspects should be addressed: (1) virion ubiquitin content (e.g., abundance of unanchored moieties and their linkages); (2) architecture of the viral fusion pore; and (3) availability of other uncoating factors in the cytoplasm.",

It is intriguing that K63-linked ubiquitin chains are implicated in aggresome clearance, as this modification is an element of immune signaling [121] rather than the UPS (often K48-linked). There is perhaps an unexplored link between ubiquitin, aggresome processing, and immune response to viral infection. Unraveling such molecular interactions between virus and host cell is of critical importance for understanding the cell biology of virus infection, and for future design of antivirals.",

The attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to proteins involves consecutive action of three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and ubiquitin ligase E3. First, the C-terminus of ubiquitin binds to E1 in an ATP-dependent manner. Ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 to E2. Finally, the E3 binds both the ubiquitin-bound E2 and the substrate and catalyzes formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and the substrate lysine residue. The lysines on the substrate-conjugated ubiquitin can be further polyubiquitinated. A multitude of cellular proteins that contain different ubiquitin-binding domains\u2014namely ubiquitin binding proteins (UBPs)\u2014mediate the cellular functions of ubiquitination. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) that also contain ubiquitin-binding domains can revert or modify ubiquitination. DUBs vary in the specificity towards different types of polyubiquitin linkages, the position of cleavage within polyubiquitin chains, the ability to separate single ubiquitin moieties, etc. Some DUBs produce unanchored polyubiquitin chains that regulate aggresome processing and innate immunity. The red ubiquitin depicts ubiquitin that is anchored, and the blue ubiquitin depicts unanchored ubiquitin with a free C-terminus.",

E3 ubiquitin ligases polyubiquitinate misfolded proteins, and those with a tetra K48-linked ubiquitin chain or longer are degraded by the proteasome [78]. Proteasome inhibition leads to formation of large, misfolded protein aggregates with polyubiquitinated chains, which are cleaved into unanchored ubiquitin chains by DUBs such as Ataxin-3. The C-terminus of ubiquitin is exposed on the unanchored ubiquitin chains and bind to HDAC6 ZnF-UBP. This, by yet unknown mechanisms, activates dynein binding of HDAC6 via its linker region between CD1 and CD2. The unanchored ubiquitin chain(s) is now linked to the dynein motor and microtubules, allowing retrograde transport of the protein aggregate toward the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) (aggresome formation). Misfolded aggregates that are sequestered to the MTOC eventually form a large complex called the aggresome. HDAC6 promotes autophagy, which involves the actin network, myosin II, and Poh1, a proteasome-associated DUB. Poh1 generates K63-linked unanchored ubiquitin chains that activate HDAC6 (aggresome clearance) [12]. The red ubiquitin (Ub) depicts ubiquitin that is anchored, the blue ubiquitin depicts unanchored ubiquitin with a free C-terminus; Right side: IAV hijacks the aggresome processing machinery during host cell entry. After binding to the cell surface, IAV internalizes by endocytosis, travels to late endosomes (LEs) in the vicinity of the MTOC. In LEs the low pH (5.5\u20135.0) triggers hemagglutinin (HA) acidification and fusion of the viral envelope with the limiting endosomal membrane. The fusion pore exposes the viral core containing unanchored ubiquitin chains to the cytosol, which recruit HDAC6 and activate the aggresome processing machinery. HDAC6 binds to matrix protein M1, dynein, and myosin, and promotes capsid disassembly by the shearing force of the cytoskeletal motors (box; uncoating). M1 becomes dispersed in the cytosol, the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) penetrate into the cytosol and are imported into the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes by importin \u03b1/\u03b2 [52,66]. Unanchored ubiquitin carried by IAV might activate HDAC6 similar to aggresome processing [12]. HDAC6, unanchored ubiquitin chains are implicated in retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) immune signaling and NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome regulation [13,79,80].",
