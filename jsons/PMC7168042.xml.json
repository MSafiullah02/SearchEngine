Inflammation may also have extended to adjacent tissues and the glottis may be hard to visualize and even to locate (19). Where there is stridor a cautious inhalational induction with an otolaryngologist present is appropriate, either in the OR or in the ICU. The use of a cuffed endotracheal tube will be useful to prevent soiling of the lungs from either spontaneous rupture or surgical drainage of the abscess. The use of cuffed tubes, even in young children, has been shown to be safe (20, 21, 22).

In 1936, Lemierre described a condition of \u2018anaerobic postanginal septic\u00e6mias\u2019 associated with \u2018Bacillus funduliformis\u2019\u2013 now known as Fusobacterium necrophorum \u2013 and \u2018B. symbiophiles\u2019 (26). This paper described an evolving condition beginning with suppuration at the local site, followed by thrombophlebitis with septic emboli a later feature. No specificity was attributed to F. necrophorum but rather a recognition that the picture may be caused by normally saprophytic anaerobes, possibly working in synergy (26), and indeed its growth may be promoted by coexisting aerobes (27). The septicemic phase typically occurs 4\u20135 days after the onset of a sore throat or tonsillitis and is characterized by a rise in temperature and rigors, whereas the original pharyngeal/tonsillar condition may have improved (28). The infection has local effects, classically causing thrombosis in the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (IJV), and more distant spread with suppuration most commonly affecting the lungs, but also causing septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, meningitis and liver, renal and skin abscesses (\u2018necrobacillosis\u2019) (28).",

Surgical access to these lesions is most often achieved using a suspension laryngoscope and anesthesia achieved with either spontaneous ventilation with insufflation of gases into the hypopharynx or by jet ventilation. The latter can be used either supra\u2010 or infra\u2010glottically by rigid cannulae fixed to the laryngoscope (43). In either case, an antisialogogue is administered and topical lidocaine sprayed onto the larynx (max. 6 mg\u00b7kg\u22121) (44, 45). Disadvantages of jet ventilation, particularly supra\u2010glottically, are the potential dispersion of papillomatous matter distally and the need for muscle relaxation and, if used sub\u2010glottically, one must ensure adequate escape of gases to prevent barotrauma. However, contamination of the field and the OR with vapors are then avoided (46). Advantages of spontaneous ventilation are the preservation of the patient\u2019s respiratory drive, a potential safety factor, and the relative containment of debrided material. Additionally, total intravenous anesthesia can reduce or supplant the need for vapors (44, 45, 46). Tracheostomy is generally avoided as this is associated with increased distal spread (41).",

However, type b (Hib) was responsible for approximately 85% of invasive disease in children prior to immunization against this type (48) and epiglottitis accounted for about 12% of Hib infections (49). For those nations who undertook widespread immunization in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the incidence of Hib\u2010related infections dropped dramatically. The adult form seems different; a slower onset of symptoms where dysphagia and sore throat precede stridor (47), a more diffuse anatomic involvement, justifying the term supraglottitis (50), and half the need for airway intervention (47).",

Increasing respiratory effort is capable of quite large decreases in intrapleural pressure. This will increase the pressure gradient across the pulmonary capillary and override the Starling equilibrium. The resulting transudation of fluid will cause acute pulmonary edema (95). Hypoxia itself will cause failure of the integrity of the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane and exacerbate the transudative leak. The result is decreased pulmonary compliance which then, in turn, exacerbates the child\u2019s dyspnea and respiratory compromise (95, 96).",

However, medically, it is commonly provided as 79 : 21%. This can be added to an oxygen blender and the output monitored, thus providing a variable FiO2 as needed (97, 98). In patients that are already hypoxic, the introduction of Heliox should be done incrementally. As the viscosity of the inspired gases drops, any benefit or deterioration in oxgenation should be monitored carefully. When used in croup, heliox has been shown to procure improvements in croup scores similar to nebulized epinephrine (99). Reviews of the available evidence to support the use of heliox in this situation have demonstrated a need for further studies in this area (97, 98, 100). Helium has high thermal conductivity and so care needs to be taken with respect to humidification and avoidance of patient hypothermia (101, 102) and it should not be used in nebulizers as these depend on the generation of turbulence to deliver the drug (102).",
