Sebastiani et al. [3] in this issue show that the strict isolation measures as taken in Lombardy and later on in all over Italy was associated with the reduction of progression of the epidemic. This approach has enormous negative economic and societal consequences [4] but may be justified in the beginning of an epidemic when infection rates, hospitalization rates and case-fatality cannot be stratified by potential determinants. As soon as more detailed data on the spread and case-fatality of the corona infections is available, a targeted, that is, riskadapted approach to prevent corona infections is possible and should be implemented because social isolation of the entire population will lead to unsustainable conditions in the population in the long run. For a targeted strategy to prevent deaths from COVID-19, a high-risk approach is possible and does not have the enormous negative economic and societal consequences.",

For example, in Italy the case fatality (CF) as of March 17, 2020 was 0.3-0.4% among people aged 30-49 years, 1.0% among people aged 50-59 years, 3.5% among people aged 60-69 years, 12.8% among people aged 70-79 years, and 20.2% among people aged 80 years or more [5] . The COVID-19 outbreak at the cruise ship Diamond Princess showed that the virus infected 621 out of 3711 persons within 4 weeks and six died. All of the deceased were at least 70 years old and at least two of them had comorbidities [6] . Furthermore, data from China show that people with comorbidities have higher CF (cardiovascular diseases: 11%, diabetes: 7%, chronic respiratory diseases: 6%, hypertension: 6%, cancer: 6%) whereas the overall CF in China as based on an analysis of 72,314 patient records was 2% [7] . Recent data on the case-fatality in Italy [8] , Spain [9] , and the U.S. [10] show similar age gradients of the case-fatality with barely any case-fatality below age 60 years and a cubic increase of the case-fatality among the elderly (Fig. 1 ).",
