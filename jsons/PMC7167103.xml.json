Although viral culture is traditionally the gold standard method, it is often slow and technically demanding, which causes problems in patient management. Direct immunofluorescence tests and rapid antigen assays can produce results in a relatively short\u2010time frame compared with viral cultures; however, their sensitivity and specificity are lower and can only be used for specific viruses.9 Nucleic acid\u2014based methods are often preferred for the diagnosis of viral respiratory infections, especially for hospitalized patients. These tests quickly identify the agent with high sensitivity and help to facilitate the appropriate management for both the patient and the infection control measures.10 Specific polymerase chain reactions (PCRs; monoplex) can be used to identify single viral agents such as influenza A/B and RSV, however, their role is limited. Multiplex PCR tests (mPCRs) allow a fast detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses, therefore their importance and use are increasing with several commercial options.11\n",

Although can be seen at any age, pertussis is more frequent and cause more severe disease in children younger than 3\u2010months\u2013old because of lack of primary vaccination.30 High vaccine coverage (at least 95%) is necessary to protect children against vaccine\u2010preventable diseases with the herd immunity. The importance of herd immunity is nicely described by an Italian study of three cases of B. pertussis, one 16\u2010month old and two less than a month old children showing that reduced immunity of the child's family over the years increases the risk of infection especially in infants lack maternal immunity with a more severe clinical presentation. In Italy, vaccination coverage dropped from 97% in 2000s to 92% in the areas where the cases were reported due to the parental opposition to vaccination.31\n",

The same relation was also seen for RSV and metapneumovirus. Virological diagnosis of the pathogen was important since these three viruses caused infections in the same season. Surveillance and monitoring of the annual/seasonal characteristics of the respiratory viruses are critical in predicting and detecting epidemics and pandemics. In this way, it would be possible to diagnose the correct pathogen and prevent inappropriate antimicrobial treatment.",
