The host developmental stages killed, and attacked, by each parasite species are analysed. Smaller species and males tend to kill earlier Phyllonorycter instars than do larger species and females, and certain of the endoparasites as well as the ectoparasites must discriminate between small hosts which receive haploid eggs and large hosts which receive diploid eggs. Hostfeeding is very widely practised, and facultative hyperparasitism is engaged in by all except the braconids and a few specialized chalcids. The biology of a parasite species generally allows its allocation to one of three groups according to the size of host larva that it attacks, whether it is endoparasitic or ectoparasitic, whether or not the host continues to develop after parasitization, the extent of its hyperparasitic behaviour, its reproductive capacity, and the width of its host range. Different strategies, together with different specific host and habitat preferences, provide the basis for parasite complexes of high species diversity.",

P. cavella is univoltine with most of its mining activity occurring during the second larval generation of the other species. Identification of parasitized Phyllonorycter presents many problems since it must be based upon characters of the leaf-mine unless the Phyllonorycter has developed to the pupal stage. Pupae can be identified by the structure of the cremaster and the distribution of spines on the posterior segments. On oak, the structure of the cocoons of P. guercifoliella and P. harrisella differ in the first generations (Miller, 1973) and this enables prepupae to be separated, but earlier stages cannot be distinguished. P. lautella is often recognisable by its gregariousness and preference for mining very small oak trees and, in later instars, the characteristic feeding pattern within the mine. On birch, mines sampled during the first period of mining activity (i.e. to the end of the first week of August), and from which parasites were reared, were recorded as probably P. ulmtjoliella, and thereafter some of the more obvious size extremes could be assigned to the smaller P. ulmlfOliella and the larger P. cavella.",

Ratios of adult endoparasites (broods) to ectoparasites reared from the two generations are : 1st generations, 0.73 (oak) and 0.63 (birch) (n = 1168) 2nd generations, 2.84 (oak) and 7.47 (birch) (n = 2571, and inspection of Table 1 shows Achrysocharoides species to contribute most to the high proportion of endoparasites in second generation mines.

This abundance of tree-specific Achrysocharoides in the second generations underlies the low percentage similarities (Table 2) between the two trees when either sample, or both, is of the second generation.

P. alcueus occupies an intermediate position, sometimes attacking hosts as young as the third larval instar, but also attacking older hosts. Rearing data (Tables 3 and 4) strongly suggest that those endoparasites (C. nephereus, C. laomedon and perhaps C. trfasciatus) which attack only old host larvae prevent their further development. Additional evidence for this comes from dissections of a sample of mines of the weevil Orchestes fagz (L.) on beech. All 0. fag larvae which later produced C. nephereus were final instar and extremely sluggish. They had conspicuous oviposition wounds, and dissection of some revealed very young endoparasite larvae. None of the hosts continued to develop before being killed by C. nephereus, which was the only endoparasite in the sample. Pitakpaivan ( 1975) records similar behaviour for Chrysocharis gemma (Walker) as an endoparasite of Phyllonorycter messaniella on Quercus ilex. C. nephereus, C. laomedon, C. tnfasciatus and apparently also Achrysocharoides, like ectoparasites, distinguish between small hosts in which haploid eggs are laid and large hosts in which fertilized eggs are laid. The first three of these, by preventing host development past the stage attacked, have a fixed resource, like an ectoparasite, and this explains the disparate distribution of fertilized and unfertilized eggs. Development of hosts of Achrysocharoides, however, does continue after parasitization, so that there is much less restriction on the quantity of food that the endoparasitized host can supply to its parasite. Since both Achrysocharoides species have solitary males but usually gregarious females, it may be the stress on a small host larva of supporting several parasites that reduces the numbers of females developing in hosts attacked when young.",

C. braconius and Achrysocharoides species were the most frequently recorded hosts of hyperparasites, probably only because their early stages are easy to recognise. The Ichneumonoidea did not figure as hyperparasites although Gelis is very frequently a hyperparasite in other situations. All of the more common ectoparasitic chalcids (except Cirrospilus lyncus for which data are limited) were at least occasionally recorded as hyperparasites. Among the endoparasites, Achrysocharoides and C. phryne, which attack young hosts, do not engage in hyperparasitism, but it was commonly observed in those species that attack older Phyllonorycter. C. trfasciatus, in fact, was mostly reared as a hyperparasite, and males of P. saulius also appear to specialise in the habit. Our few records of this latter species can be supplemented by others kindly supplied by Miss G. Bryan who reared eleven males and eight females from oak Phyllonorycter mines. All of the females but only three of the males developed as primary parasites. Among the hyperparasitic Entedontinae in general, except C. trfmciatus, males more often than females developed as hyperparasites. Perhaps surprisingly, no such sexual difference was apparent among the ectoparasitic hyperparasites ( Table 5 ) . All of our records probably refer to pseudohyperparasitism (Shaw & Askew, 1976b) . The incidence of hyperparasitism and multiparasitism is under-recorded since not all ectoparasitized hosts could be satisfactorily dissected to establish whether or not they were also endoparasitized, and not all ectoparasite larvae were examined for endoparasites.",

In the A. circumcriptus sleeve, mines scored as host-fed were few compared with the many successfully parasitized.

They are endoparasites but polyphagous and carry small egg loads, thus combining features of the two more extreme strategies. Endoparasites are typically restricted in their host ranges by specialized adaptations required to avoid the hosts' encapsulatory defence reactions. Such adaptations are normally not effective in a wide range of host species, but the species mentioned have clearly escaped from such restriction by the expedient of quickly killing the host. Species of the ichneumonid genus Pimplu, which are remarkably polyphagous endoparasites of Lepidoptera pupae, also appear to kill their hosts extremely rapidly (Fuhrer & Kilincer, 1972) . Not only do C. nephereus and C. laomedon attack several host species as primary parasites, but they can also develop hyperparasitically. This latter ability is important to a parasite attacking older Phyllonorycter mines because at this stage there is a high level of primary parasitism and limitation to the role of primary parasite would severely reduce the number of available hosts. Closterocerus trfufasciatus and perhaps male Pediobius saulius provide examples of further specialization in this direction, both most commonly behaving as hyperparasites and apparently rapidly killing their hosts. The concept of an endoparasite necessarily having a restricted host range (and therefore needing to attack young stages of an endophytic host) is clearly not universally applicable.",

It is moderately polyphagous, attacking a wide range of Phyllonorycter species but, apparently, not other genera (Askew & Shaw, 1974) unless behaving as a hyperparasite. It attacks hosts from the third instar onwards and permits their development to the pupal stage.",

The Phyllonorycter populations thus support parasite faunas that are biologically varied and very rich in species.",
