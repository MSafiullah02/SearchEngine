In human environments, bioaerosol contaminants can cause adverse health impacts, such as allergic, infectious, and toxigenic diseases [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Recently, many researchers have published works on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infection outbreaks caused by lethal viruses, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome [5,6], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [7,8], novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1; cause of swine flu) [9,10], and, very recently, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) first detected in Wuhan, China [11,12]. A variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles under continuous airflow conditions [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]].",

            "text": "Lee et al. [20] assessed the anti-viral performance of an iodine (I2)-releasing filter medium as a protective device against airborne pathogens by using MS2 aerosols. Rengasamy et al. [21] evaluated the efficacies of surgical filters treated with four different antimicrobial agents (silver-copper, EnvizO3-Shield, iodine-activated resin, and TiO2) against aerosolized MS2 virus-containing droplet nuclei. Woo et al. [22] investigated the inactivated performance of dialdehyde cellulose filters against an airborne MS2 virus with various treatment times. In this study, we have investigated air filter coatings using different nanoparticles (NPs) and studied their anti-viral efficiencies against viruses captured by the filter. In our previous works, tests were conducted with non-infectious viruses for safety reasons. In addition, Joe et al. [23] fabricated an anti-viral filter using an aerosol coating of silica hybrid particles decorated with silver NPs (SiO2-Ag) and conducted an anti-viral ability test against the aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 virus. Furthermore, Park et al. [24] developed an instrument for dry coating a commercial air filter unit with a large number of SiO2-Ag NPs. They evaluated the filtration capability and anti-viral activity of the instrument against the aerosolized bacteriophage MS2. Moreover, Park et al. [25] coated a glass fiber filter medium with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and performed an inactivation test against the bacteriophage MS2 virus. Joe et al. [26] evaluated the anti-viral efficiency of a silver (Ag) NP coated air filter against the bacteriophage MS2 virus through the process of dust loading. In all the aforementioned works, the bacteriophage MS2 virus was aerosolized using an atomizer or nebulizer, delivered to a filter by forced convection flow, and collected on the filter surface. The collected virus particles were then eluted from the filter surface to a liquid medium containing Escherichia coli strain C3000 (as the host of the bacteriophage MS2 virus) through physical vibration (sonication, vortex, and shaking) or elution with a urea-arginine phosphate buffer (U-APB) solution. Subsequently, plaque counting was performed, thereby enabling the evaluation of the effect of the NPs coated on the filter on the viability of the virus particle.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, the test mentioned above (hereafter termed the air media test) may not be recommended for airborne infectious viruses due to the possibility of aerosol transmission [[27], [28], [29]]. In addition, because airborne virus particles move with airflow and can be captured by air filters used in indoor air cleaning, the data from the air media test are more practical and useful to people who need to use the air filters, such as healthcare workers [30,31]. This paper presents a novel method of determining the anti-viral capability of an air filter against an airborne infectious virus. First, an Ag NP coated filter was inserted into a liquid medium in which infectious virus particles (H1N1) were dispersed. Then, the plaque counting method was conducted, hereafter termed the liquid media test. The results of the liquid media test were then converted to those of the air media test by using a correlation equation, which was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained from the two media tests with the selected non-infectious virus particles. Susceptibility has been used to explain the relative importance of various parameters affecting antimicrobial efficiency, such as the coating areal density of Ag NPs on the filter surface. Yoon et al. [32] used the susceptibility constant to evaluate the antibacterial effects of Ag and Cu NPs.",

Fig. 4 also contains scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the coated filter with increasing coating areal density. This figure illustrates that the Ag NPs were well distributed on the glass fibers and the amounts of Ag NPs were well matched with the coating areal densities. Moreover, the SEM images clearly show that the depth deposition was the dominant filtration mechanism for the filter media because of the use of the micrometer fibers [41].

Fig. 5\nshows the air media test results for \u03b7\u00afantiviral (see Equation (2)) with various Ag NP coating areal densities, in which the MS2 bacteriophage was used. In addition, Fig. 5 shows the liquid media test results for \u03b7\u00afantiviral with various NP coating areal densities. Because \u0393depo\u03c4=Cair=Cliquid, Equation (3) was also applied to the liquid media test. The value of \u03b7\u00afantiviral for each media test increased and became saturated as the areal density of the coating increased. Notably, the \u03b7\u00afantiviral for the liquid media test was lower than the \u03b7\u00afantiviral for the air media test, implying that \u03baliq < \u03baair. In other words, the virus particles are more susceptible to Ag NPs in air media than in liquid media. One plausible reason for this could be that in the air media test, many of the virus particles may have directly contacted the Ag NPs after being deposited and fixed onto the surface of the filter. On the contrary, in the liquid media test, virus particles could move freely in the liquid, enabling many virus particles to avoid contact with the Ag NPs. Specifically, the chances for virus particles to interact with Ag NPs were higher in the air media than in the liquid media tests.",

In Fig. 6, curve fits were attained by substituting the experimentally determined susceptibility constants into Equation (11) and then calculating the corresponding survival fractions. The correspondence between the curve fits and the experimental results are represented by R2 values of 0.985 and 0.935 for liquid media and air media tests, respectively. The susceptibility constants, Zliquid and Zair, were 3.94 \u00d7 10\u221211 and 2.00 \u00d7 10\u221210  cm2 particles\u22121, respectively. As anticipated, the susceptibility constant of the air media test was higher than that of the liquid media test. An explicit correlation was found between the two susceptibility constants, expressed as follows:(12)Zliquid=\u03b2Zair,where \u03b2 represents a constant dependent on species of virus particles and anti-viral agent NPs. The experimental results for the MS2 bacteriophage were predicted by Equation (12) when \u03b2 was set to 0.196. The values of \u03b2 for the E. coli bacteriophage T1 and the T4 bacteriophage were found to be 0.2 and 0.198, respectively (Fig. S3). Although the three virus types had different sizes, the values of \u03b2 were similar at approximately 0.2 (Fig. S3).",

The susceptibility constant of the liquid media test, Zliquid, was 6.96 \u00d7 10\u221211  cm2 particles\u22121, which resulted in an air media test susceptibility constant ( Zair) of 3.48 \u00d7 10\u221210  cm2 particles\u22121.

Through testing conducted in liquid media, these results can be a basis for further fundamental research on predicting the viability of human-infectious viruses that can cause respiratory diseases in air media.",
