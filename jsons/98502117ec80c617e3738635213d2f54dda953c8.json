Epidemiology literally translates as \"study of what is over the people\"; and in our lifetimes, no health related threat had hung so heavily over us as the threat from Coronavirus . There is no evidence, yet, that women in the mid and late trimesters of pregnancy are more susceptible to catching the virus than other members of the public, and there is no evidence, yet, that the virus crosses the placenta (Chen et al., 2020) . Presently, in China, infected mothers are separated from their babies for fourteen days to prevent the baby being infected, exactly as they would be from any other non-infected person. As yet there is no evidence that mothers infected in early pregnancy are more likely to have babies with congenital anomaly, but many of these women have not yet given birth. The virologists tell us that infected babies will have a pneumonia and need to be treated with everything that we have in our armory against neonatal respiratory disease (Lu and Shi, 2020) . They can offer nothing more. Our knowledge and experience of treating the pandemic changes by the hour and I fully expect that, when this is published, a lot more will be known about all these things.",

            "text": "Marcelle Di Angelis Ambar Felipe and her colleagues, working in Brazil, have calculated the errors made by infusion pumps when the pump is either placed lower than the baby, or the infused solution is very viscose. This is fascinating. We rely so much on the equipment that we use in neonatal care to be accurate. Tiny inaccuracies are not as important in adult patients but, with our fragile babies, and considering the small amounts that we need to infuse, the differences can be so important. Their findings are thought provoking. Theresa Maier, and her UK team, were also interested in delivery of drugs and nutrients to neonates. They discovered that parents struggle to use oral syringes on breast-fed babies and considered nipple shields an acceptable solution. This is one in a series of articles by these researchers, proving that simple solutions are often very effective (Maier et al., 2019) . Continuous monitoring is an ongoing theme in this issue. Deepak Sharma and his colleagues in India used a device to monitor their neonates continually from birth until admission to the neonatal unit. They found that their babies were being admitted with undesirably low temperatures. Continuous monitoring showed them that the hypothermia was developing before the baby reached the radiant warmer where resuscitation took place; and was associated with low temperatures in the delivery room. This is so important because neonatal hypothermia is known to contribute to mortality and morbidity (Perkins et al., 2018) ; and raising the temperature in the delivery room is such a simple solution to a very serious problem.",

Their babies were more mature and they looked at the optimal time to transfer a baby from an incubator to a crib. This process is important to the families as the incubator is sometimes viewed as a barrier to intimacy with the baby (Hall et al., 2013) . These authors suggest that the correct time to transfer is not dependent on the baby's weight (New et al., 2011) , but on the corrected age -an interesting read.",
