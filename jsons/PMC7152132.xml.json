A nanometre (nm) is one billionth of a metre, or 10\u2212 9\n m. Nanotechnology is not simply the continuation of miniaturization from micrometre scale down to nanometre scale but also permits entirely different and improved functionalities. For example, crystals in the nanometre scale have a low melting point, reduced lattice constants, higher surface area and catalytic activity. The band gap of semiconductors can be engineered by varying their size in the nanometre range while super-paramagnetism will be observed in the case of magnetic materials. In the United States, nanotechnology has been defined as being \u2018concerned with materials and systems whose structures and components exhibit novel and significantly improved physical, chemical and biological properties, phenomena and processes due to their nanoscale size\u2019 (National Nanotechnology Initiative, 2000, www.nano.gov). Although nanotechnology is new, research in biology and colloidal science has been at a nanometre scale for centuries. The current enthusiasm for nanotechnology is driven by the availability of characterization and manipulation techniques at nanometre level and the continued shrinking of devices in the semiconductor industry, as predicted by Moore\u2019s law.",

In addition to combining individual nanostructures together to form large structures through sintering or Ostwald ripening, agglomeration is another way to reduce the overall surface energy. For practical applications, the formation of agglomerates should be prevented as they are very difficult to separate. For the fabrication and processing of nanomaterials, the following challenges must be met (Cao, 2004):(a)overcoming the huge surface energy, a result of enormous surface area or large surface to volume ratio;(b)ensuring that all nanomaterials have the desired size, uniform size distribution, morphology, crystallinity, chemical composition and micro-structure that together result in the desired physical properties;(c)preventing nanomaterials from coarsening through either Ostwald ripening or agglomeration as time passes.\n",

Milling and colloidal dispersion are typical examples of top-down and bottom-up methods, respectively. The bottom-up approach promises a better chance of obtaining nanostructures with fewer defects and more homogeneous chemical composition, as it is mainly driven by the reduction of Gibbs free energy leading to a state closer to thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, the top-down approach is more likely to introduce internal stress, in addition to surface defects and contaminations (Cao, 2004). A schematic representation of the top-down and bottom-up approaches for the synthesis of nanomaterials is given in Fig. 8.1\n.",

Figure 8.2\nshows the completely dispersed silver nanoparticles prepared in our laboratory. In general, nanocrystals refer to single crystalline nanoparticles and quantum dots refer to sufficiently small nanoparticles exhibiting quantum effects (in semiconductors) and surface plasmon resonance (in metals). The synthesis of metal nanoparticles, usually called colloids, can be traced back to Michael Faraday in the mid nineteenth century. Even today it is a very convenient procedure to generate gold colloids by Faraday\u2019s method using the reduction of [AuCl4]\u2212 by citric acid. The particles formed are surrounded by an electric double layer arising from adsorbed citrate and chloride ions and by the corresponding cations. The resulting Coulomb repulsion between the particles prevents aggregation and coalescence. Figure 8.3\nillustrates the situation between two particles having electric double layers. The Coulomb repulsion between the particles decays approximately exponentially with the particle distance (Bradley, 1994).",

Limiting the skin\u2019s exposure to sunlight, especially during the hours of maximum intensity, is the best way to reduce risk. For a person who must work outdoors this is not feasible, well-designed clothing made from UV-blocking textiles is the best alternative. The various processes undergone by the incident UV light on a fabric material are represented in Fig. 8.5\n. The transmitted and scattered light will be the focus here as it is this light that is actually responsible for sunburn. ZnO nanoparticles score better than other nanoparticles in terms of cost-effectiveness, whiteness and UV-blocking properties. The UV-blocking properties of a fabric are enhanced when a dye, pigment, delustrant or UV-absorbant finish is present that absorbs UV radiation and blocks its transmission through the fabric to the skin (Hustvedt and Crews, 2005). Metal oxides such as ZnO are more stable as UV blockers when compared with organic UV-blocking agents. Hence, the nano-form of ZnO will really enhance UV-blocking properties due to the increased surface area and intense absorption in the UV region. Our research (Vigneshwaran et al., 2006) has indicated excellent antibacterial activity against two representative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and promising protection against UV radiation for the nano-ZnO-impregnated cotton textiles. Figure 8.6\nshows the steps in the process of coating cotton fabrics with nano-ZnO in our laboratory and Fig. 8.7\nshows a scanning electron micrograph of nano-ZnO (embedded inside starch granule)-coated cotton fibres.",

If the critical surface tension of the solid is less than surface tension of the liquid, the fabric will repel the liquid. In the case of solids \u2018critical surface tension\u2019 is used instead of \u2018surface tension\u2019. Thus, water repellency can be attained when the critical surface tension of the solid is smaller than surface tension of the liquid. For example, when a drop of water is dripped on a cotton fabric, it has been experimentally determined that the surface tension of water and the critical surface tension of cotton are, respectively, 72 dyne/cm and 200 dyne/cm, and, therefore, water readily wets the cotton fibre. However, once the cotton is treated with a fluorocarbon the water-repellency relation between them changes. The critical surface tension of water-repellent-finished cotton is less than the surface tension of water. Fluorocarbons are organic compounds consisting perfluorinated carbon chain. They tend to decrease the surface tension of the substrate (Zabicky, 2006).",

In 1975, the researcher Wilhelm Barthlott, then at the University of Heidelberg, elucidated this phenomenon. Only at the beginning of the 1990s was it possible for W. Barthlott, and his collaborator Christoph Neinhuis (later Zdenek Cerman and others) to harness this physico-chemical phenomenon technically. Barthlott coined the trade name Lotus-Effect\u00ae for the patented self-cleaning super-hydrophobic micro- to nanostructured products and copyrighted it in 1997 (http://www.lotus-effekt.de/en/faq/index.php). Over millions of years of evolution nature has developed surfaces \u2013 the ideal example being the leaves of the lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) \u2013 which, through a complicated micro- to nano-scale surface structure, repel dirt (see Fig. 8.8\n). The surfaces concerned are those that, owing to their chemistry, are water repellent (hydrophobic). These particular properties, however, are not only determined by the chemistry but also, in particular, the micro- to nanostructure: in the ideal case this is composed of a bulky structure (5\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter) and a fine structure (10 nm to 5 \u03bcm) layered on top. Adhesion of particles to these surfaces is minimal because they touch only the tips of the surface structure. The particles are washed away by water droplets, which roll off. As a result, the surfaces stay dry even during a heavy shower. Furthermore, the droplets pick up small particles of dirt as they roll, and so the leaves of the lotus plant keep clean even during light rain. The technical expression of these basic ideas is patented as the Lotus-Effect\u00ae, and the surface acquired the aspect shown in 8.9, 8.10\nshows a scanning electron micrograph of a super-hydrophobic textile material.",

These loaded textiles show a significant photo-oxidative activity under visible light in air under mild conditions, which discolours and mineralizes persistent pigment stains contained in wine and coffee. The mineralization of stains on the textile loaded with TiO2 was monitored quantitatively to assess the appropriate surface pretreatment in conjunction with the most suitable deposition method for TiO2 colloids, powders, or a combination of both; their photocatalytic activity allowed, in kinetically acceptable times, the almost complete discoloration of coffee and wine stains.

Encapsulation can be achieved by several methods, e.g. interfacial polymerization, microemulsion polymerization, precipitation polymerization and diffusion. In general, the drug is brought into contact with a set of monomers, oligomers or polymers. These assemble around the payload; polymerization will give the final particles. An alternative method is to prepare the nanoparticle in the absence of the drugs, which are then absorbed by the nanoparticles following afterwards (Soane et al., 2001). Another MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) investigation is a cloth linking nanoparticles of gold in solution with strands of DNA coded to change colour when exposed to the DNA of biological agents, so your shirt could detect low doses of chemicals in the air, for instance, or your dressing gown could diagnose viruses like flu or SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).",

With increased performance comes added value and additional revenue. One company to realize this has been the Burlington Industries subsidiary, Nano-Tex. Branded as one of the \u2018coolest\u2019 products in 2003 by Time Magazine, Nano-Tex is providing clothing manufacturers such as Levi\u2019s, Eddie Bauer, Gap and Old Navy the means to make their products more durable, more water and oil repellent, and more stain resistant, while also reducing the need for washing \u2013 all without altering the feel of the fabric. Nano-Tex\u2019s chemical formulation and application technology, which is easily adopted by existing textile mills, changes the fabric itself on a molecular level, embedding it with tiny, floppy, hair-like fibres that themselves are attached to a common spine. The \u2018nanowhiskers\u2019 in the chemical mix prevent stains from soaking into clothing. Nano-Tex is said to have plans to expand its product range to include stain-proof mattresses, boat covers and hotel bedding. Looking at the previously stated definition of nanotechnology it could be argued that Nano-Tex\u2019s technology is not really nanotechnology but improved chemistry; however the company is realizing a profit while other \u2018proper\u2019 nanotechnology companies are still waiting and dreaming.",

The silver nanoparticles in the effluent from a cotton nanofinishing process could be removed efficiently by the use of Chromobacterium violaceum (Duran et al., 2007), which is able to absorb, metabolize or store metal ions, and thus environmental damage will be avoided. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, concerns relating to public health and safety and the environment have resulted in increasingly stringent environmental regulations (Theodore, 2006). Hence, there is a need for the development of fully-fledged norms and regulations for the use of nanomaterials and their disposal in the environment. In the case of textiles, it will be of great concern that both the finished product and the effluent will comply with these regulations. Since textile products have the closest interaction with our body, they must be evaluated for their toxicology and tolerance levels.",

Once the nanowire is pushed to bend far enough to reach the other Au-coated nanowire, electrons in the external circuit will be driven to flow through the uncoated nanowire due to the forward-biased Schottky barrier at the interface. (f) When the top fibre is further pulled, the Au-coated nanowires may scrub across the uncoated nanowires. Once the two types of nanowires are in final contact, at the last moment, the interface is a forward-biased Schottky, resulting in further output of electric current, as indicated by arrow-heads.
