A 2019 Cochrane review concluded that overall, the evidence for eHealth interventions is of low quality and insufficient to guide clinical practice in kidney disease 6 . Moreover, a randomized trial that included 601 patients with CKD found that an eHealth intervention that used home monitoring devices to obtain biometric data (for example, blood pressure and weight) and deliver multidisciplinary care did not reduce mortality, hospitalization rates, emergency department visits or nursing home admissions when compared with usual care 4 . However, patient acceptance and engagement with the eHealth intervention was high; 91% of participants completed 1 year of follow-up with an average of 14.2 completed virtual visits. On average, participants took 14.9 blood pressure measurements per month and used the educational modules on 5.8 days per month 4 . Multiple other studies have reported high participant satisfaction with kidney eHealth interventions for a variety of reasons, including ease of use, low burden and increased frequency and quality of interactions with health-care staff 6 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 301, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 988, "end": 989, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1229, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Efficacy of eHealth interventions"}, {"text": "A study of commercially available mobile applications (apps) for kidney care reported that only 7 of 28 were rated as high in quality by both nephrologists and patients.

First, although eHealth can enhance disease detection and monitoring, it can introduce new safety concerns owing to suboptimal design, technological failures or invalid data. For example, the study of mobile apps discussed above found that only two of seven health tracking apps generated alerts for abnormal values such as extremely high blood pressure 7 . Device failures in clinical trials have resulted in reduced participant satisfaction, engagement and retention with eHealth monitoring 6 . Cuff-less blood pressure devices based on pulse transit time have been found to correlate with oscillometric measurements in research settings, but the accuracy depends on posture and the devices require frequent calibration 9 . Many wearable devices will require additional validation before clinical use. Clinicians and patients must remain vigilant about the potential for errors, particularly if eHealth tools are used in place of traditional monitoring without full validation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Efficacy of eHealth interventions"}, {"text": "Second, patients with kidney disease have complex needs that can make remote monitoring via eHealth tools less suitable than traditional face-to-face care. Certain aspects of the physical exam, such as examination of catheter exit sites, may be difficult to perform via video consultation. The physical presence of the C o m m e n t provider may also be reassuring and comforting for patients with emotional distress 4, 5 . Providing CKD education via web modules, mobile apps or text messaging may not fully address the complexity of kidney care or patient-specific questions. Thus, the US 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act allows patients to choose between telehealth and face-to-face encounters so that the care modality meets their individual needs 5 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 419, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 420, "end": 421, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 746, "end": 747, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Efficacy of eHealth interventions"}, {"text": "Other issues exist that are not unique to kidney care.

All hardware and software tools must meet relevant security standards, and patients and care providers must be trained to use the equipment correctly and conduct the visits securely 5 . An ongoing extension of the TAKE-IT study, TAKE-IT TOO, aims to address the practical issues of incorporating the TAKE-IT intervention into routine clinical practice 8 .
