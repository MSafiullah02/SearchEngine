The development of new microbiological diagnostic techniques that allow the identification of the causative microorganism in less time is allowing the optimisation of antimicrobial consumption. These tests include rapid virological diagnostic techniques in respiratory samples. 3 There are conflicting data in the literature on the benefit of these techniques in the practice of paediatric patients.
