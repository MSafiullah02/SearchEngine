Among the zoonotic hookworm species, until now, only A. ceylanicum have been shown to cause patent human infections, for which dogs and cats can be reservoirs.

Ancylostoma caninum also has the ability to cause eosinophilic enteritis in humans7, and there have been a few reports of the natural parasitism of adult worms of this species in human intestines8,9. However, none of these studies have reported sexually mature worms, so egg production has never been detected. In fact, experimental infections in humans with A. caninum resulted in intermittent abdominal pain and eosinophilia, but eggs were not observed in feces at any time10. Nevertheless, George and coworkers11 detected DNA from A. caninum in human feces, suggesting that the role of animals as reservoirs of hookworms in humans may be underestimated and should be investigated.",

Additionally, because the eggs are identical, the true prevalence of the hookworm species that affect humans is undetermined in most regions in the world in areas where these parasites are endemic. Therefore, in this work, we aimed to molecularly identify the species of hookworms parasitizing humans. This is of crucial importance because different populations of parasite species are a factor that may affect the prevention strategies used against parasites, since each species may have its own hosts, routes of transmission and pathogenesis17,18. In addition, such screenings may help to answer controversial questions about zoonoses11. Here, we performed the molecular identification of individual hookworm eggs from six Brazilian states. For the first time, we report the presence of A. caninum eggs in human fecal samples, which indicates an important and neglected epidemiological issue.",

The sequencing of the samples identified as Ancylostoma spp. revealed that these eggs were from A. caninum, demonstrating 100% of similarity to the A. caninum sequences available in the GenBank database (Accession numbers: KP844730.1; DQ438075.1; DQ438071.1). To determine the presence of possible contamination from dog and cat samples, DNA extraction of the A. caninum-positive feces was performed. By using conventional PCR and subsequent sequencing, it was possible to determine that the sample had only human DNA; therefore, there was no evidence of contamination with animal feces. Figures 1 and 2 show representative agarose gels from the analyses of the molecular identification of hookworms and hosts, respectively.",

All of these studies performed analyses of adult worms and egg/larvae pools. We performed our analyses by conventional PCR by using a method previously standardized by Sahimin and coworkers16, with some modifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify hookworm species from single eggs. This is important because individual analysis allows the accurate detection of species, whereas, depending on the sensitivity of the technique, egg/larvae pool analysis can detect only the most prevalent species in the sample. In addition, obtaining adult worms for morphological analysis is unfeasible for obvious reasons.",

These data corroborate the molecular analyses of Monteiro and coworkers25, who evaluated hookworm populations in humans in northeastern Brazil. Brooker and coworkers26, by using morphological analysis, observed that all adult hookworms recovered from populations in southeastern Brazil were N. americanus, while Marzochi and Chieffi27, by using the morphological analysis of larvae obtained after fecal culture, observed the presence of A. duodenale in 14.2% of the analyzed samples. Studies in other South American countries, such as Ecuador, have also described A. duodenale in the intestines of humans28. In the present study, no A. duodenale eggs were detected. Biological characteristics linked to the development of N. americanus explain why this species is the most prevalent. The eggs of this species do not develop at temperatures below 15 \u00b0C, and the larvae prefer shady, moist areas with temperatures at or above 30 \u00b0C29.",

Nevertheless, our results reveal for the first time the presence of A. caninum eggs in human feces. This may have a direct implication for the epidemiology of human parasitism by this species, since the source of infection could not be restricted to infected animals only. This should be critically studied further, especially since control strategies have been focused on classically described hosts (dogs and cats) in terms of vaccine development and coverage. Indeed, in recent decades, the target glutathione-s-transferase-1 has been studied as a vaccine antigen for N. americanus (Na-GST-1)36 and A. caninum (Ac-GST-1)37. Although this vaccine has resulted in a decreased number of adult worms and fecal eggs in dogs37, tests of the efficacy of this vaccine in humans have never been performed36. Because vaccine targets are species-specific, variation in hookworm species in a geographical region may negatively influence vaccine efficacy. In fact, regional variability may even impact anthelmintic efficacy; mutations involved in drug resistance in A. caninum collected in the field from different regions of Brazil have been described by our group38.",

This has already been demonstrated in dogs with coprophagic habits, which can excrete Eimeria spp. and non-dog typical helminth eggs39,40. This is especially common for plant nematodes that are commonly ingested during human feeding, such as a parasite of the genus Meloidogyne41, causing infected patients to present with eggs in their feces without completion of the parasite cycle. However, hookworm eggs have a single and very thin membrane that would most likely be destroyed during passage through the stomach of humans42. Thus, the morphological characteristics of A. caninum eggs make this hypothesis strongly untenable. In addition, by observing the stage of egg development under optical microscopy, there was an absence of embryonated eggs in the feces. In case of the eggs simply being in transit through the gastrointestinal tract, it would seem probable that they would already be embryonated (see Supplementary Fig. S1).",

In fact, many studies report the presence of hookworm eggs in food43,44 and also in water45. However, this a very low probability since twelve A. caninum eggs were found in the respective patient.

We suggest that additional analyses should be performed to determine the infection pathways. According to Landmann and Prociv10, patients with eosinophilic enteritis caused by A. caninum acquired the infection percutaneously. In fact, migration of the hookworm larvae into skeletal muscles has also been reported in an individual with a large cutaneous exposure, with recovery of third-stage larvae within a muscle fiber50. Normally, infection with this nematode occurs by the ingestion of filarioid larvae or penetration of these larvae into the skin of animals3,4. To complete their development, larvae need to be able to produce various enzymes involved in connective tissue degradation, such as hyaluronidases, which are often species specific5,51,52. Could this indicate the adaptation of the larvae of this species, which in recent times have been able to infect humans? Considering the proximity of the classical hosts to the human species, has A. caninum acquired the ability to develop and reproduce in the intestines of humans, or has this just not been reported so far? These are extremely important questions that may lead to new chapters in the history of parasitology.",

In summary, 2 ml of stool suspension was homogenized, filtered through gauze and transferred to a 15 ml tube. Five milliliters of sulfuric ether were added to the suspension and then stirred vigorously, followed by 1 min of centrifugation at 14,000 \u00d7 g. The supernatant was discarded.

The eggs were washed again using 500 \u03bcl of ultrapure water, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 \u00d7 g. The supernatant was then discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of ultrapure water. For DNA extraction, the eggs were observed under an optical microscope, individually pipetted into a volume of 1 \u03bcl and transferred to a 500 \u03bcl microcentrifuge tube containing 10 \u03bcl of buffer, as described by Lake and coworkers55.
