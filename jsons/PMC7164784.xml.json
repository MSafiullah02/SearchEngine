Since the publication of the MERS Seminar in The Lancet in 2015,5 MERS-CoV cases have continued to be reported in communities and hospitals across the Arabian Peninsula, with occasional cases in travellers resulting in non-sustained outbreaks in health-care settings in other continents.4 In this Review, we provide the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and highlight measures to reduce the risk of transmission in community and nosocomial settings.",

            "text": "People in close contact with dromedary camels, patients with MERS-CoV infections, and health-care workers caring for patients with MERS-CoV are at an increased risk of acquiring the infection compared with the general population. MERS-CoV transmission from camels to human beings is thought to occur via direct contact with camels through respiratory droplets or saliva, or through consumption of camel products, such as milk or undercooked camel meat.15, 18, 22, 23 Camel to human cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV has been confirmed by viral RNA sequencing of samples obtained from infected dromedary camels, and from symptomatic22, 23 and asymptomatic patients24 after known exposure to the infected camels. A study25 of animal herds associated with patients with MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia found that the nasal swabs of 75 of 584 dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA for about 2 weeks, whereas the nasal swabs were negative for MERS-CoV RNA in other animals, including goats, sheep, and cattle. Notably, 70\u00b79% of camels associated with individuals with MERS-CoV infections had MERS-CoV antibodies as determined by ELISA assays, and full genome sequencing identified ten MERS-CoV camel isolates that were identical to the isolates of their corresponding patients.25 Nevertheless, testing of sera from 191 people with various degrees of exposure to an infected dromedary herd found no serological evidence of infection.26 These data suggest that although MERS-CoV infection is widespread among dromedary camels, zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to human beings is relatively uncommon, and human disease burden is not directly proportional to potential exposure to camels.26 Furthermore, although dromedary camels are a known host species for MERS-CoV, less than half of the people who have primary MERS-CoV infections have a history of exposure to dromedary camels.4, 5, 13 On the basis of existing MERS-CoV sequence data that examined the phylodynamics between camels and human beings using a structured coalescent model, Dudas and colleagues27 have shown that long-term evolution of MERS-CoV occurs exclusively in camels, whereas human beings serve as a transient and ultimately terminal host. Additionally, the study showed that human outbreaks of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula were driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of the viruses from camels.27\n",

Patients with mild infections can have low-grade fever, a runny nose, dry cough, sore throat, and myalgia. Patients with severe infections have pneumonia that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem disease, and organ failure. Oh and colleagues35 measured progression of pneumonia in patients with severe infections by scoring the number of lung zones involved on chest radiographs, and showed that pneumonia progressed abruptly after about 7 days of illness, and the severity of the symptoms reached a peak after approximately 14 days. MERS-CoV viral load in lower respiratory tract samples is higher than the viral load in upper respiratory tract samples.35, 36 Additionally, extrapulmonary features including myalgia are common.5, 6, 13, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Up to half of all patients with MERS-CoV infections have acute kidney injury, and a third of patients who are critically ill have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea,29 and MERS-CoV can be detected in stool specimens.37 Between Dec 2, 2014, and Nov 12, 2016, Ahmed and colleagues38 collected daily information from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health on people with MERS-CoV, and recorded 660 confirmed cases of human MERS-CoV infections.

The authors identified 12 probable cases of secondary transmission (4%; 95% CI 2\u20137%). Seven apparently healthy individuals who were household contacts carried MERS-CoV in their upper respiratory tract. This finding, together with the observation that people with asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections had low amounts of MERS-CoV RNA in upper respiratory tract samples during outbreaks in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,48 indicate that MERS-CoV can be transmitted from asymptomatic household or hospital contacts.",

Both clusters involved transmission of the infection to household contacts, health-care workers, and other patients. In June, 2017, an outbreak of 34 MERS-CoV cases occurred in a hospital in Riyadh.58 The primary case was a 47-year-old man admitted to the emergency department for intubation, who at that time was not identified as having a MERS-CoV infection. Before his diagnosis, 220 health-care workers, patients, and visitors came into contact with him. Contact tracing identified an additional 33 people with MERS-CoV infections during this outbreak. 50% of the people who became infected during this outbreak were health-care workers. 11 patients were classified as having severe disease, seven of whom died, and 22 were asymptomatic. One individual from this June, 2017, cluster sought treatment for renal failure and had a renal dialysis at another health-care facility in Riyadh and this led to five additional people being infected with MERS-CoV: three household contacts, one patient contact in the hospital, and one health-care worker. Unrelated to this cluster, in June, 2017, another MERS-CoV cluster of nine cases occurred at a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; this outbreak involved a butcher who reported direct contact with dromedary camels and eight health-care workers (four asymptomatic and four with mild disease).58\n",

Upper airway samples from health-care workers that were positive for MERS-CoV usually became negative on PCR testing within 2\u20133 days;23 although prolonged MERS-CoV positivity detected by PCR for up to 35 days has been reported in a health-care worker with subclinical infection.43 Prolonged MERS-CoV-positive PCR results have been noted in some patients with MERS-CoV-negative viral cultures who are recovering from the infection.36, 62, 63 Although prolonged MERS-CoV-positive PCR results could be due to the slow turnover of damaged respiratory epithelium containing non-viable RNA fragments of MERS-CoV in some patients, whether people who are asymptomatic (especially health-care workers) can transmit MERS-CoV to patients who are at high risk of infection, such as patients who are immunocompromised or patients with chronic renal or lung disease is unclear. In a Korean study,64 591 health-care workers who cared for patients with MERS using proper personal protective equipment were screened for MERS-CoV after finishing the patient care. The screening revealed that three (0\u00b75%) health-care workers had acquired asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections. A follow-up study65 of a nurse with an asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in South Korea showed that she did not transmit the infection to the 82 people they had been in contact with, whereas another study46 speculated that a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia was probably related to exposure to an unrecognised individual with asymptomatic or subclinically mild MERS-CoV in a hospital setting. Four generations of transmission among health-care workers in hospital, shared housing, and home environments were observed in Saudi Arabia after investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV caused by an index patient (a nurse with MERS-CoV and pulmonary tuberculosis) who had contact with 73 people. Although the disease was mostly mild, transient, or asymptomatic among the health-care workers, this study51 has shown that health-care workers could transmit MERS-CoV to other health-care workers despite being asymptomatic.",

Investment in the development of rapid point-of-care testing for MERS-CoV would be of great value to the global public health community. The upsurge in the number of human MERS-CoV infections over the past few years in health-care facilities in the Middle East and South Korea was attributed to several preventable factors. Low health-care worker awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV with consequential poor implementation of infection control procedures resulted in nosocomial outbreaks. These outbreaks involved transmission of the infection to existing hospital patients, outpatients, visitors, and health-care workers within health-care facilities. Transmission was associated with overcrowding, absence of isolation room facilities, and environmental contamination, without substantial genetic changes in the transmissibility of the virus.58\n",

Although exposure to dromedary camels and related contact activities are important risk factors for primary MERS-CoV infections, the exact mechanisms of transmission require urgent investigation. Genomic studies indicate that MERS-CoV strains causing infections in human beings are indistinguishable from the virus found in dromedary camels in the Middle East. A surveillance study70 for MERS-CoV in dromedaries in Africa and central Asia which used MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralisation assays has shown that MERS-CoV antibodies are highly prevalent in camel serum samples from African countries. Using quantitative RT-PCR, positive specimens for MERS-CoV were detected in camel nasal swabs from all the African countries from which samples were collected. By contrast, dromedary serum and swab samples from Kazakhstan in central Asia were shown to be negative for MERS-CoV when using these assays.71 Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene revealed that MERS-CoVs from Africa formed a cluster closely related to, but distinct from, the viruses in the Arabian Peninsula. These findings indicate that MERS-CoV is actively circulating in dromedary populations in Africa, but the MERS-CoV virus in Africa is phylogenetically distinct from that in the Middle East.69 The finding that MERS-CoV is not universally endemic in dromedaries raises the hypothesis that some species of bats, or some other animal, the environment, or both, could constitute a maintenance community and be the true natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, and that the virus is transmitted to camels and is maintained within camels for varying periods of time.71\nPanel 5Unanswered questions: MERS-CoV determinants, risk factors, and transmission\n\u2022Although camels are known reservoirs, what are the exact animal or environmental sources of MERS-CoV?\u2022What are the modes of primary transmission to human beings in sporadic cases?\u2022Why do children have a low prevalence of MERS-CoV infection and disease?\u2022Do other risk factors for transmission between camels and human beings exist?\u2022What are the seasonal trends in transmission and disease patterns?\u2022What is the role of asymptomatic or mild infections in human-to-human transmission in the community and in nosocomial settings?\u2022What are the drivers of transmission and exact modes of transmission in health-care settings?\u2022What are the specific exposures that put health-care workers most at risk?\u2022What roles do health-care workers who have asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections but who are positive for MERS-CoV RNA have in nosocomial transmission and outbreaks?\u2022To what extent does environmental contamination within hospitals have a role in the nosocomial spread of MERS-CoV?\u2022What are the MERS-CoV viral shedding patterns in different bodily fluids over the course of the illness\u2022What are the roles of non-respiratory specimens (eg, faeces, urine, saliva, semen, sweat, blood, and tears) in the transmission of MERS-CoV?\u2022Why has MERS-CoV persisted for longer than severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV?\u2022What is the specific pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection?\u2022Why are autopsy and pathological studies scarce, and why does the specific pathology of MERS-CoV remain undefined?\u2022What are the innate and adaptive protective immune mechanisms involved in MERS-CoV infections?\u2022Are protective immune mechanisms deleterious for the patient?\u2022What MERS-CoV mutations and evolutionary changes are taking place over time?\u2022Do host genetics have a role in susceptibility and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV?\u2022Do animal models of MERS-CoV accurately reflect human infection?\nMERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",
