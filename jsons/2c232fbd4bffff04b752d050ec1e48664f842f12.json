Recently, a large study from Wuhan has suggested application of CT scan as an alternative diagnostic method which as of today demonstrated higher sensitivity than existing RT-PCR kits [9] despite that it has not yet been approved by major radiology associations. CT scan is a widely available modality and can readily be performed. In this study, it was reported that 88% of suspected patients had findings suggestive of COVID-19 in chest CT while the positive rate of RT-PCR kits was only 59% [9] . Of those with negative RT-PCR, CT findings were suggestive of highly likely disease and probable disease 48% and 33% respectively [9] . It was also shown that CT findings were detected in infected individuals before the RT-PCR kits did in symptomatic individuals. In patients whose initial serologic result was negative and subsequently were found to be positive on repeat testing, the second positive test results took an average of 5.1 days. Ninety-seven percent of those cases already had positive imaging findings, which were present with a mean of 8 days before the second positive serologic test results were available [9] .",

While they may be nonspecific, these findings are easily identifiable on CT and should in the proper clinical setting aid diagnosis. GGO is an increased attenuation with preserved vascular and airway markings. With consolidation, these markings are obscured by the infiltration's effect on images. In a recent study, 78% of symptomatic patients had these findings on CT; of those, 60% demonstrated bilateral lung involvement. Imaging findings were detected in 91% of cases within 3-5 days after symptom onset.

Myers et al. have recently suggested that radiology departments should prepare for the flood of COVID-19 patients during the outbreak and therefore should be engaged in creating the hospital's mass casualty incident plan [16] . Furthermore, severely symptomatic patients will often undergo multiple imaging studies during the course of their illness. The cumulative effect of these multiple exams can significantly increase the cumulative radiation dose these patients may receive during their hospitalization and recovery. The as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle states that whenever radiation is expected, the exposure should be as low as reasonably achievable [17] . Keeping this important principle in mind, it is critical that we remember that any CT scan we perform should be accompanied by the justification of examination and optimization of radiation dose [18] . This is of particular importance when evaluating more radiation-sensitive patient populations such as pregnant patients and children. While CT imaging has been shown to be a great help in establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19, the potential for increased radiation exposure to a large number of patients across the country cannot be ignored. Balancing the need for effective imaging to aid rapid diagnosis while also trying to minimize radiation exposure will be important for radiologists and clinicians alike as we work together to manage to COVID-19 outbreak.",

These parameters further increased to up to 96% when patients were symptomatic for more than 48 h. The likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis increased to 91% from pre-LDCT value of 43% in patients with suggestive imaging findings whereas it was decreased to 9% in those with normal or atypical imaging findings.

Kubo et al. compared the detection of GGO and reticular opacities of LDCT with a previous CCT and reported an agreement rate of 83% between them [25] . In contrast, Christe et al. showed that sensitivity of LDCT (77%) is less than CCT (89%) in the detection of GGO particularly for patchy lesions but no significant difference was observed in the detection of consolidation between these scans. In fact, of the missed GGO lesion, half were detected as a nodule [26] . Kim Y. et al. observed no significant differences between LDCT and ULDCT in the detection of GGO and consolidation [19] .",

A 1-year-old child is 10 times more susceptible to the adverse effects of ionizing radiation than an adult [28] . In a study published in JAMA, the routine effective dose delivered to pediatric patients during chest CT was calculated between 5 and 8 mAs. The lifetime attributable risk of solid organ malignancies per 10,000 CT scans was measured as high as 30 and 9 for girls and boys respectively. As it is expected, the projected radiation dose to body organs is higher in thyroid, lung, breast, and esophagus during a chest CT acquisition. It was reported that as low as 350 CT scans are needed to be performed to observe 1 cancer in girls [29] . LDCT scan has been also suggested in the evaluation of lung abnormalities in pediatrics and successfully detected GGOs and consolidations. Sun et al. measured an overall radiation dose of 0.59 mSv for evaluation of necrotizing pneumonia in different methods of irritative reconstruction which was significantly lower than CCT. They also demonstrated better detection and lower noise for lung lesions using LDCT performed with iterative reconstruction [21] . Therefore, low-dose CT image acquisition methods are of value in the evaluation of pediatric patients.",

Low-dose CT demonstrates multifocal basilar predominant peripheral ground-glass opacities, characteristic of SARS- CoV-2 pneumonia (a, b) . The low-dose CT chest radiation dosimetry of the patient was DLP of 78.34 mGy \u00d7 cm and CTDIvol of 2.03 mGy. Conventional CT chest protocol in the same patient would result in DLP of 301.14 mGy \u00d7 cm and CTDIvol of 7.87 mGy, which means that low-dose protocol decreased the radiation dose to less than 50% without a significant impact on the diagnostic value.

The patient had areas of consolidation superimposed on ground-glass opacity in bilateral lung bases (b). The constellation of findings is in keeping with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The low-dose CT chest radiation dosimetry of the patient was DLP of 68.21 mGy \u00d7 cm and CTDIvol of 2.10 mGy. Conventional CT chest protocol in the same patient would result in DLP of 264.55 mGy \u00d7 cm and CTDIvol of 5.92 mGy, which means that low-dose protocol decreased the radiation dose to about 50% without a significant impact on the diagnostic value.

They obtained LDCT images using the IR method in various levels of radiation dose and compared it with filtered back projection (FBP) method which is widely used in scanners. They observed that although there was no significant difference in visual detection of reticular opacity between these two modalities, IR dramatically improved GGO visualization at low radiation doses. In a clinical study, IR demonstrated better detection of necrotizing lesions in children evaluated for necrotizing pneumonia [21] . Ohno et al. showed that without the implementation of IR, the image quality of LDCT was significantly lower than CCT. Following the addition of IR, no significant difference was noted [27] .",

Although LDCT and ULDCT have demonstrated comparable efficacy in the detection of GGO and consolidation in patients with pneumonia, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of LDCT and ULDCT in the detection of pulmonary findings in the setting of COVID-19. A head to head comparison of low-dose and conventional protocol in very early stages of the disease is needed, while in intermediate and advanced stages, probably the low-dose CT protocol will provide adequate image quality and diagnostic accuracy.",
