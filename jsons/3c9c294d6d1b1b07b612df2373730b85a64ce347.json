The number of the cumulative laboratory-confirmed cases is fast increasing from 27 on Dec 31, 2019 to 42638 on Feb 10, 2020 with only 41 days from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). Strong evidences have been proved that COVID-19 has the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings [1] . The COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) at Jan, 1, 2020. To fight against this serious COVID-19 virus, the Chinese government had been setting up extreme control strategies, such as the lockdown of Wuhan and initiating a top-level emergency response to rein in the outbreak of the epidemic associated with COVID-19 in the other provinces of China, which has made great contribution to the global human society.",

Until now, some literatures has used the disease dynamic models to analyze the spread and outbreak of COVID-19 in China [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 10] . A SEIR epidemic model to estimate the spread in the major cities of China considering the international passengers [2] . However, with the present disease control strategies, the quarantine in different representative populations should be considered and the total population is constant. Therefore, in this study, considering the quarantine, we establish a SEIRQ epidemic model to explore the COVID-19 spread characteristics under the current control conditions. The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section, a SEIRQ model is established and illustrated, data and methodology are displayed. In Section 3, the simulation and forecast, and scenario analysis of the quarantine strategies effects on the COVID-19 variations are investigated which are our main results.

The disease extinction days are 114, 111, 108, 106 and 104 for q 1 = 0.1, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13 and q 1 = 0.14, respectively which shows that the strong quarantine on the susceptible individuals can shorten the disease extinction time. However, the disease extinction days with the q 2 from 0.53 to 0.57 and q 3 from 0.76 to 0.80 have small differences with the values of 0-2 days. For the maximum values of the cumulative death individuals, the numbers are decreased from 5736 for q 1 = 0.1 to 2033 for q 1 = 0.14, from 3478 for q 2 = 0.53 to 2821 for q 2 = 0.57, and from 3184 for q 3 = 0.76 to 3070 for q 3 = 0.80. 9   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62 For mainland China, the peak values of the cumulative confirmed cases are decreased from 120731 for q 1 = 0.09 to 62729 for q 1 = 0.13, from 88997 for q 2 = 0.53 to 75915 for q 2 = 0.57, and from 83556 for q 3 = 0.74 to 80536 for q 3 = 0.78 indicating the stronger impacts of the quarantine on the susceptible individuals than the other two individuals. However, the disease extinction days have not large differences among the changes of the quarantine strategies of the susceptible individuals, exposed individuals and infectious individuals, respectively. For the maximum values of the cumulative death individuals, the numbers are decreased from 7135 for q 1 = 0.09 to 3960 for q 1 = 0.13, from 5451 for q 2 = 0.53 to 4672 for q 2 = 0.57, and from 5112 for q 3 = 0.74 to 4938 for q 3 = 0.78.",

In this study, we established a SEIRQ epidemic model based on the present quarantine strategy to investigate the COVID-19 variations in Wuhan and mainland China employing the reported data from Jan 27, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020.

In general, it is very hard to capture the disease variations with high accuracy by the dynamical models. We have been compared our forecasting with the observed data prolonged 10 days from Mar 6, 2020 to Mar 15, 2020. The absolute values of RE (relative error) of the cumulative confirmed cases are smaller than 2.05% (Table 3) . The results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model with very high correlation coefficients and very small biases in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. For the different quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining will seriously increases the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the disease extinction. These results provide important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease control strategies and public health.",

For the second aspect, the date of the peak value of the confirmed cases is Feb 19, 2020 which is the 24 days (i.e. t=24). Because the averaged latent period of the COVID-19 is 5 days, the other time points are T 1 = 4, 9, 14, 19, 29, 34 and T 1 = 39 which are Jan 30, Feb 4, Feb 9, Feb 14, Feb 24, Feb 29 and Mar 5, 2020, respectively. The baseline quarantine values are employed before the eight time points (including the baseline), and after these time points there is no quarantine on the susceptible individuals and exposed individuals. It should be noted that the quarantine on the infectious individuals is always employed in all the days of the two aspects. The effect results of the two aspects are displayed inFigures 7,8.For the first aspect, the quarantine time points at T 1 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 indicate the baseline quarantine strategy is applied with 0 1,2,3,4,5 days time delay which result in the increasing peak values of the cumulative confirmed cases and the corresponding prolonged time days (Figure 7A).
