On return to Japan on 6 January he visited a local clinic where he tested negative for influenza. Despite this, his symptoms of fever, cough, and sore throat continued, so he attended a local hospital on 10 January where he was admitted and found to have abnormal infiltrates on his chest X-ray. He remained febrile until 14 January and was eventually tested as positive for 2019-nCoV on 15 January.9 He became afebrile on the same day and was discharged home where he remains stable.

Importantly, such symptoms appear to persist longer in cases of 2019-nCoV infection than in most cases of uncomplicated influenza. Similar to SARS and MERS, there is still no specific, licensed antiviral treatment for CoVs and the clinical management is mainly supportive. Infection control guidance will be likely based on existing guidance for SARS and MERS, perhaps with some additional heightened precautions due to the largely unknown nature of this new virus.",
