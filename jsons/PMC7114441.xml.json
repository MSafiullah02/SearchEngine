The S protein consists of 1255 amino acids that forms typical petal-shaped spikes on the surface of SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003). There is no direct evidence that the S protein of SARS-CoV is processed proteolytically into the S1 receptor-binding subunit and the S2 membrane fusion subunit, but the two subunits can be predicted by sequence alignment with other coronavirus S proteins (Rota et al., 2003, Spiga et al., 2003). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV in vitro and in vivo (Kuba et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003) by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD, amino acids 319\u2013510) of the S protein (Chakraborti et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). Additionally, there are 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the SARS-CoV S protein (Rota et al., 2003), and two are in the RBD.",

We constructed a new vector using a human codon-optimized RBD DNA sequence, and created a stable RBD-Fc-expressing cell line. The RBD spike protein could then be secreted into culture medium and easily purified by Protein A affinity chromatography. The flow cytometry assay and immunostaining experiments demonstrated the endocytosis of the RBD spike protein by susceptible cells together with ACE2. At the same time, the removal of N-glycans from the RBD spike protein could still induce ACE2 internalization. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV alone can trigger the endocytosis of susceptible cells.",

In brief, the column was first washed with 10 column volumes of the binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Then the cell culture supernatant was pumped onto the column. Next, the column was washed with 20 column volumes of the binding buffer followed by the supernatant. Finally, the RBD-Fc protein was eluted with 2\u20135 column volumes of the elution buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 3.1). Neutralization buffer (60\u2013200 \u03bcl, 1 M Tris\u2013HCl, pH 9.0) was added to each collection tube. The RBD-Fc protein was further purified using a HiTrap Protein A HP 1 ml column (GE healthcare Amersham Biosciences AB). The protein concentration was determined using Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol, in which bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a standard.",

For the B-lymphotropic papovavirus (LPV), the binding capacity is similar at 4 and 37 \u00b0C (Haun et al., 1993). For HIV-1, the affinity of virion-bound gpl20 for soluble CD4 at 37 \u00b0C is higher than that at 4 \u00b0C (Moore et al., 1991). However, internalization only occurs at 37 \u00b0C. It is known that cellular endocytosis is a mechanism for SARS-CoV entry (Inoue et al., in press, Wang et al., 2008). Our previous study using a flow cytometry assay showed that SARS-CoV S protein is internalized by VeroE6 cells together with ACE2 at 37 \u00b0C (Kuba et al., 2005). The RBD of the S protein binds to ACE2, which is the ligand of ACE2. To determine whether the RBD spike protein binding leads to the endocytosis of SARS-CoV by susceptible cells, a flow cytometry internalization assay was performed. A FITC-conjugated human IgG-specific antibody cannot pass through the plasma membrane of live cells, so it was used to detect the cell surface-bound RBD-Fc protein. The fluorescence intensity on the surface of VeroE6 cells incubated with RBD-Fc at 37 \u00b0C was much weaker than those incubated at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 2A). We speculate that this decrease of fluorescence intensity might result from the internalization of RBD-Fc by VeroE6 cells.",

This indicated that the RBD spike protein was internalized into the cells after incubation. Furthermore, the Fc signals overlapped with the ACE2-GFP signals in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface (Fig. 2C, D and E), which suggests that the RBD spike proteins are co-localized with ACE2 proteins in these cells.

For the influenza virus, certain glycans near the receptor-binding site affect the binding of the HA to cellular receptors (Ohuchi et al., 1997). We therefore explored whether glycosylation on the RBD spike protein has an effect on the interaction between SARS-CoV and ACE2. The S protein of SARS-CoV has 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Rota et al., 2003), and a minimal ACE2-binding domain (amino acids 319\u2013510) contains two (amino acids 330 and 357), which are N-linked glycosylated when expressed in HEK293 cells (Chakraborti et al., 2005). The RBD-Fc we expressed migrated at approximately 64 kDa on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1), which was slightly larger than the molecular mass of the RBD-Fc based on amino acid composition. We speculated that RBD-Fc might therefore be N-linked glycosylated. To confirm this, deglycosylation of the RBD-Fc was performed using PNGase F, which hydrolyzes all types of N-glycan chains. After treatment with PNGase F, the single band of approximately 64 kDa migrated as a 54 kDa band on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), which indicated that the RBD-Fc was N-linked glycosylated in HEK293 cells. To maintain the natural conformation, the RBD-Fc protein was deglycosylated with PNGase F under nondenaturing conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 3), the N-glycans in the RBD-Fc were removed under nondenaturing conditions as completely as under denaturing conditions.",

Many viruses can activate cellular signal transduction pathways after binding to the plasma membrane (Greber, 2002, Nemerow, 2000, Pelkmans et al., 2002), in order to make use of the cell machinery for entry. Cellular endocytosis is often used by viruses for entry (Marsh and Helenius, 2006, Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003). Viruses may enter different cell types via different endocytotic pathways. SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway for its entry into HepG2 cells (Inoue et al., in press). However, SARS-CoV can enter VeroE6 cells in a novel clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytotic pathway (Wang et al., 2008). Our previous study showed that the SARS-CoV S protein could induce the internalization and recycling of ACE2 (Wang et al., 2008). Here, we demonstrate that the RBD spike protein alone can be internalized together with ACE2. We propose that after binding to ACE2, the RBD spike protein activates the ACE2 mediated cellular endocytosis signal pathway, by which SARS-CoV enters the susceptible cells.",

ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase, which plays a central role in regulating the severity of acute lung failure during the disease process, together with other components of the RAS (Kuba et al., 2005). SARS-CoV S-protein-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 appears to contribute to the severe acute lung injury in SARS (Kuba et al., 2005). Here, we demonstrate that the binding of the RBD spike protein leads to ACE2 internalization. This is consistent with worsened acid-induced acute lung injury by RBD spike protein treatment in wild type mice (Kuba et al., 2005). It has also been reported that in other viruses, the virus receptor is down-regulated by the interaction with the virus ligand. For instance, after binding with HIV gp120, CD4 was internalized and led to the impairment of immune cell functions (Wahl et al., 1989), and the binding of measles hemagglutinin resulted in the down-regulation of its receptor, CD46, to disrupt the complement pathways and immune systems (Oldstone et al., 1999). Therefore, in addition to using receptors for cell entry, many viruses may induce down-regulation of the receptor to impair its normal function, leading to severe disease.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we created the stable RBD-Fc-expressing cell lines, and we demonstrated SARS-CoV RBD spike protein induced cell endocytosis after binding to ACE2. Additional N-glycans on the RBD spike protein had no effect on its binding to ACE2. Cell endocytosis is an important mechanism for SARS-CoV entry. Our study shows that the RBD spike binding is the trigger for this entry pathway, which further confirms the importance of the RBD spike protein in SARS-CoV infection. Because the RBD spike binding to ACE2 contributes to SARS pathogenesis, the use of subunit vaccines based on the RBD spike should be considered carefully. A RBD spike protein mutant, which diminishes or eliminates its avidity with ACE2, but retains the major neutralizing epitopes, is desirable. Previous study has shown that the replacement of two active-site histidines of ACE2 by asparagines does not affect the syncytia formation mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein (Li et al., 2003). A soluble form of enzyme-inactive ACE2 may be used for SARS therapy.",
