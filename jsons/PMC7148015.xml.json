Even though large amounts of data are available in highly specialized subject databases (such as ArXiV or PubMed), digital libraries (like the ACM Digital Library), or web search engines (Google Scholar or SemanticScholar), many user needs and requirements remain unsatisfied. The central concern is to find both relevant and high-quality documents - if possible, directly on the first result page - for the actual user of an academic search system. The question of what constitutes relevance in academic search is multi-layered [4] and a topic that drives research communities like the Bibliometrics-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshops [10].",

The goal is to foster knowledge on improving the search for academic resources like literature (ranging from short bibliographic records to full-text papers), research data, and the interlinking between these resources.

However, this requires that the developers of the experimental systems also have access to the production systems, which is rarely the case. Living labs make this possible by bringing platform operators and researchers together. At the same time, they provide a methodological and technical framework for online experiments.",

A hard requirement is that the platforms actively participate in the initiative and have implemented the corresponding API for their systems. The API developed under a free license is publicly available and represents the greatest success of the campaign to date. Within CLEF, LL4IR was first organized as a lab in the form of a challenge at the CLEF 2015 conference series and continued with TREC OpenSearch 2016 and 2017 [2].",

The common interest in academic search seems small compared to these scenarios. Many information systems are based on bibliographical metadata (e.g., WoS, Scopus, PubMed) and do not make use of full-text information, which in most cases is not available due to licensing hiccups of the academic publishing system. Even when full-text is searchable, the characteristics of scientific communication are not thoroughly operationalized and are even ignored. This leads to simple search systems that still heavenly rely on Boolean Retrieval techniques to get the most out of the available (meta-)data. Although during the last years, the BIR community added much traction for the overall topic of academic search, it is not focusing on the rigorous evaluation of proposed methods. The lack of an overall evaluation scenario leads to little understanding of the consequences for the different domains and fields of science.",

In this track, a corpus of bibliographic records and research project descriptions from the Social Sciences was created to test the special needs of scientific retrieval tasks. As stated by the organizers: \u201cGeneral-purpose news documents require very different search criteria than those used for reference retrieval in databases of scientific literature items, and also offer no possibility for comparable test runs with domain-specific terminology.\u201d The DS track ran for many years and developed a total of four versions of the GIRT test collection of scientific reference documents. More recently, the TREC Precision Medicine/Clinical Decision Support Track released a large test collection in 2016 based on 1.2 million open access full-text documents from PubMedCentral.

As web-search platforms like Google Scholar (or Google Dataset Search) or proprietary digital libraries like the ACM Digital Library are not open to public research and do not offer any domain-specific features, we focus on mid-size scientific search systems that offer domain-specific resources and use-cases. This focus allows for using many specific information types like bibliographic metadata, usage data, download rates, or citations in order to develop and evaluate innovative search applications. We see a clear connection to the Bibliographic-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) community that runs a series of successful workshops since 2013 at venues like ECIR or SIGIR. A proposed SMART lab on \u201cScientific mining and retrieval\u201d7 might be a good starting point to join forces. The common point of interest might be to create an integrated test collection for academic search that contains academic material and their citations, is useful for the scientific retrieval process, and is suitable for offline and online evaluation as well.",
