Although the psychological impact of quarantine has been documented [3], the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, community-wide NPIs, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear. Social media could mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 and lockdowns by maintaining social support during physical distancing, as well as providing health information, telemedicine, and online psychological counseling [4,5]. Yet social media can also spread negative emotions, rumors, and fake news during an epidemic [6-8]. In this paper, we examined risk factors including the use of social media for probable anxiety and depression in the original epicenter, Wuhan, China, and during the first month of the cordon sanitaire (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Our study showed that social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both the community and health professionals. Although physical distancing is recommended to reduce the spread of COVID-19, social support should be maintained, as it is a key source of emotional support. Mitigating the mental health impact of both the pandemic and physical distancing measures is, therefore, important [15]. The internet could be harnessed for online consultation or counseling (eg, Ali Health, Ping An Good Doctor, WeChat implemented in China) and restoring daily routines (eg, online learning, telework, exercise). Yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks [8,14]. Our findings are susceptible to reverse causality, whereby anxiety or depression could lead to rumination on social media. However, the null association between time spent on television viewing and mental health suggests social media might have a specific role in adverse mental health during epidemics. Further, our findings are consistent with longitudinal studies on social media use and mental health during major population events [14,16,17].",

COVID-19 will exact a substantial toll on the population\u2019s well-being beyond the acute respiratory illnesses and pneumonia hospitalizations associated with infections. To mitigate the long-term impact on the populations\u2019 physical, mental, and social well-being, monitoring the broad consequences of infections and interventions (eg, psychological, social, and economic costs), which may increasingly need to be conducted online due to widespread lockdowns and physical distancing measures, is of paramount importance. Building community resilience and, where appropriate, harnessing the social media while reducing the adverse impact should also be incorporated into global preparedness and response to pandemics.",
