Being a \"risk researcher\" means looking at things through a specific perspective -the perspective of what negative consequences a natural or man-made event, a technology, a decision could probably have on the world we live in. Our perspective is a socio-scientific one. This means, we are analyzing what consequences do risks have on the society and what can we do to decrease or prevent them. This includes the possible actions of a single consumer as well as strategies of whole governments to manage risks. How are risks perceived by people? What kinds of knowledge are needed to deal with different kinds of risks? Who should be involved, and when? What to do if conflicts evolve about how to handle risks? How to communicate risks? It is our job to answer questions like these. We are dealing with these questions in many different thematic areas: food safety, climate change, chemicals, nanotechnology, electromagnetic fields, etc. These risks pose very different problems and it seems difficult to find general strategies to deal with them. This first part of the book is meant to set the stage for the following chapters: We want to convey insights into current risk research on a general level, before diving into the more thematically specialized chapters of the book. This means, we illustrate what you need to know on risks and how to handle them with examples of our daily life and give you a broad picture of the different aspects of risk research.

This definition combines two dimensions: the likelihood or chance of potential consequences on the one hand, and the severity of these consequences, due to human activities, natural events or a combination of both, on the other hand. This definition implies that the concept of risk does not exclusively describe negative consequences. The judgment whether the implications are positive or negative depends on the values that people associate with them. If we think, for example, of climate change as a risk, the possible consequences like global warming might be perceived differently by different people.

The difference between risk and hazard is that as long as nobody is exposed to the chemical or an agent like, e.g., acrylamide, there is no risk, only the potential for harm. Probability and exposure are characteristics of the risk.

This means, it must be both scientifically validated (i.e., other scientists must be able to verify the results when using the same methods) and expressed in numerical terms.

The nature of this difficulty may be traced back to a number of different factors, which are subsumed under the term complexity: interactive effects among the causal agents (mutual strengthening or weakening), positive and negative feedback loops, long delay periods between cause and effect, interindividual variation and intervening variables. These are only some of the multiple factors which give hints at complexity. It is precisely these factors that make high-level scientific investigations necessary, since the causeeffect relationships in complex risks are neither obvious nor directly observable. The global decrease in biodiversity is an impressive example for a risk that is characterized by high complexity. There are many factors, like the destruction of natural habits of endangered species, increasing land use for housing and industry, landscape fragmentation, intrusion of invasive species caused by globalized transport and travels, climate change, and environmental pollution, of which the interdependencies cannot completely be identified or quantified.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Complexity"}, {"text": "This term describes a state of knowledge in which the likelihood of any harmful effects or even these effects themselves, cannot be precisely described, although the factors influencing the issues are identified. Uncertainty is different from complexity, but is often a result from an incomplete or inadequate reduction of complexity in modeling cause-effect chains. It comprises different components such as statistical variation, measurement errors, ignorance and indeterminacy (van Asselt 2000). All of these have one feature in common: uncertainty reduces the strength of confidence in the estimated cause-effect chain. If complexity cannot be resolved by scientific methods, uncertainty increases. But even simple relationships may be associated with high uncertainty if either the knowledge base is missing or the effect is stochastic by its own nature.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Uncertainty"}, {"text": "Uncertainty can be further disaggregated into separate components.

Most of the scientific disputes in risk analysis do not refer to differences in methodology, measurements or cause-effect functions, but to the question of what all this means for human health and environmental protection. An example: Emission data of greenhouse gases is hardly disputed. Most experts debate, however, whether a certain emission constitutes a serious threat to the environment or to human health. Ambiguity may come from differences in interpreting factual statements about the world or from differences in applying normative rules to evaluate a state of the world. In both cases, it exists on the ground of differences in criteria or norms to interpret or judge a given situation. High complexity and uncertainty favor the emergence of ambiguity. On the other hand, there are also quite a few simple and almost certain risks that can cause controversy and hence ambiguity.

The demographic development, including the increase of the world population, the growing population density, and visible trends toward urbanization, accompanied by significant changes in the age structure of most industrial populations have led to more vulnerabilities and interactions among natural, technological, and habitual hazards. Demographic changes are also partially responsible for the strong interventions of human beings into the natural environment. Human activities, first of all the emission of greenhouse gases like CO 2 , may cause global warming. As a consequence, they place growing stress on ecosystems and human settlements. In addition, the likelihood of extreme weather events increases with the rise of average world temperatures. Furthermore, these trends toward ubiquitous transformation of natural habitats for human purposes are linked to the effects of economic and cultural globalization: The exponential increase in international transport and trade, the emergence of worldwide production systems, the dependence on global competitiveness and the opportunities for universal information exchange testify to these changes and challenges. In terms of risks, these trends create a close web of interdependencies and coupled systems.

Globalization has contributed to the fact, that interdependencies in many cases do not require spatial proximity. For example, diseases through aggressive viruses like the avian flu can easily spread to other regions through single contacts. Another example from the thematic area of the decrease of biodiversity, is the involuntary spread of a risk of invasive species (be it animals or plants). On the one hand, expensive measures are taken to preserve the habitats of endangered species in order to protect them from extinction. But then, on the other hand, it can occur that foreign species are introduced involuntarily via global transports, etc. This species then sometimes displaces the ones that have been tried to preserve. This has, for example, happened in the US Great Lakes region with some species of fish through the invasion of zebra mussels and other species through cargo ships. 8 These are only two examples for the various challenges when facing the interdependencies produced through transboundary risks. The level of interdependencies adheres to another problem that is typical for global systemic risks: The \"goods\" (or, as described in this chapter, \"what humans value\") that are endangered through the risk are often common goods, which means that no one can be excluded from its use or profit. Public health is a nonmaterial example for such a common good. The more interdependencies there are within a particular risk situation the smaller is the probability that risk reduction measures are taken. A characteristic of common goods is, that everyone can profit from their use, even if one does not invest in their maintenance. From an individual point of view, a rational actor (be it an individual, a company, a country or any other entity) would act as \"free riders,\" i.e., benefit from the use of the good but not contribute to its maintenance. In terms of risk problems, such an actor would not invest in risk reduction measures, while he would profit from the risk reduction measures conducted by other actors. From a collective point of view, each actor would have been better off had all actors invested in the maintenance of the good. The more interdependencies there are, the less an individual actor feels accountable for investing in risk reduction measures. 9 Weak links between the affected parties contribute to this suboptimal behavior.

Anyway, interest as well as confidence and trust into the work of the European institutions have decreased during the last years. At the same time, the Europeans expect the governments and the European Union to take the lead in reducing risks which emerge in the context of globalization, growth of the population, and the economic development. This is particularly true for the handling of international systemic risks. For the improvement of people's trust and confidence into the performance of the European institutions, the European Commission has worked out a White paper (European Commission 2001), in which a number of principles of good governance are described, which should help them to carry out the task needed for the governance of, for example, systemic risks (ibid. 10f.): This includes the use of a language that is accessible and understandable for the general public, in order to improve the confidence in complex structures and decisions. \u2022 Participation: Inclusion of stakeholders and the affected and interested public is set as a crucial task of risk governance. Acceptance in decisions about the handling of risks, and confidence in the outcomes of governance processes depend on the inclusion of the interested parties throughout the whole governance chain. \u2022 Accountability: Roles and responsibilities of the different actors in the governance process have to be made clear. From a European point of view, it has to be made clear, which institutions carry out which tasks and where they have responsibility on national and international level. Additionally, the specific tasks of the involved parties in the different stages of the risk governance process have to be made clear. \u2022 Effectiveness: Risk governance policies have to be effective and timely, have to deliver what is needed on the basis of clear objectives, an evaluation of future impact and, where available, of past experience. Time and effort have to be treated as spare resources. Measures have to follow the principles of proportionality and appropriateness. \u2022 Coherence: Policies and actions have to be coherent and easily understood.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principles of the Governance of Systemic Risks"}, {"text": "As the range and complexity of institutions is constantly growing, interdependencies between different sectors are increasing, regional and local authorities are increasingly involved in European policies, etc. These tendencies require political leadership, including a strong responsibility from institutional side, to guarantee consistent procedures within this complexity. \u2022 Proportionality and subsidiarity: Throughout the whole governance process, the choice of the level at which the action is taken (from European to local level) and the selection of the instruments used must be considered in the proportion to the objectives pursued.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principles of the Governance of Systemic Risks"}, {"text": "The compliance with these principles poses high challenges to those who design and those who carry out the different steps of the risk governance process.
