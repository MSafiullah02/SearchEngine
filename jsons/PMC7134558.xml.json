Approximately 1\u20133% of humans that become infected with RVFV die of the disease, with case fatality proportions significantly higher for infected animals. RVFV, which is spread by infected mosquitoes, was first described in Kenya in 1931 and has since been documented throughout much of Africa. In 2000, RVFV spread to the Arabian peninsula, where it caused the first recorded outbreak outside of the African continent (CDC, 2000a, CDC, 2000b).",

The medium RNA segment (M segment) encodes the viral glycoproteins, GN and GC, and two non-structural proteins, which are translated as a polyprotein precursor (Schmaljohn, 2001). The glycoproteins GN and GC are sufficient for RVFV entry, which is predicted to employ a class II fusion mechanism that is activated by low pH following endocytosis of the virion (Garry and Garry, 2004, Ronka et al., 1995). The receptor(s) or attachment factors for RVFV are unknown, although the virus infects a wide range of cell types.",

            "text": "Study of the RVFV lifecycle is difficult due to the fact that primary virus strains must be handled in BSL-3+/4 containment facilities. The inherent difficulty of studying aspects of RVFV under these conditions can be avoided if assays are developed that allow for investigation of the viral proteins in a BSL-2 setting. For example, a cell\u2013cell fusion assay using only the glycoproteins GN and GC would make it possible to study the structure and function of these proteins under BSL-2 conditions. While fusion assays for members of the Bunyaviridae family have been described, including La Crosse virus in the genus Orthobunyavirus and Hantaan virus in the genus Hantavirus, no fusion assay has been described for viruses in the genus Phlebovirus (Arikawa et al., 1986, Jacoby et al., 1993, Ogino et al., 2004, Plassmeyer et al., 2005, Pobjecky et al., 1986). One of the difficulties in the development of a cell\u2013cell fusion assay for RVFV is that its glycoproteins are targeted to and retained in the Golgi, where the virus buds. When expressed individually, GN is targeted to the Golgi while GC is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002, Wasmoen et al., 1988). Thus, GN is necessary for the proper Golgi localization of GC during viral assembly.",

While plasmid vectors did not allow for sufficiently high levels of expression to achieve this goal, expression of the glycoproteins from an alphavirus replicon vector led to readily detectable cell surface expression. We found that brief low pH incubation of multiple cell types expressing the RVFV glycoproteins on their surface resulted in cell\u2013cell fusion. Expression of the omega and alpha subunits of \u03b2-galactosidase in the effector and target cells, respectively, made it possible to quantify fusion by measuring enzymatic activity of the\u03b1-complemented \u03b2-galactosidase (Holland et al., 2004). Cell\u2013cell fusion was induced when cells were incubated at pH 6.2 or below, occurred over a broad range of temperatures, and was dependent upon one or more trypsin-sensitive proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the surface of target cells. The development of a high-throughput cell\u2013cell fusion assay for RVFV will make it possible to study the structure\u2013function relationships of the viral glycoproteins and to identify host cell factors needed to support RVFV entry.",

            "text": "To study the membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins in the context of a cell\u2013cell fusion assay, they must first be transported from the Golgi to the cell surface. To achieve this, we overexpressed the GN/GC polyprotein from the ZH501 strain of RVFV in HeLa cells either from the eukaryotic expression vector pWRG7077-R4 (Spik et al., 2006) or from VEE or Sindbis-like virus-based replicon vectors (Heise et al., 2003, Thompson et al., 2006) and examined their localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. When the RVFV glycoproteins were expressed from the plasmid vector, they were targeted to the Golgi and were not expressed on the cell surface at levels that could be detected, consistent with other studies (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002, Wasmoen et al., 1988) (Figs. 1A and B\n). Since proteins that are retained in the Golgi can sometimes be targeted to the cell surface upon overexpression (Bos et al., 1993, Linstedt et al., 1997), we next examined the localization of the RVFV glycoproteins when expressed from the alphavirus vectors. When compared to expression via pWRG7077, we found that both the VEE and Sindbis virus vectors produced high levels of the RVFV glycoproteins as judged by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1E and data not shown), though GN and GC were too close in size (55 kDa and 57 kDa, respectively) to clearly resolve. In addition, both GN and GC were detected on the surface of non-permeabilized cells when expressed via the VEE vector (Figs. 1C and D). Similar results were obtained with the Sindbis-like virus replicon, but because the VEE replicon particles (VRP) could be produced to higher titers, these were used in subsequent experiments.",

Therefore, 24 h after infection with VRPs, we briefly incubated cells in a low pH buffer to induce conformational changes in the glycoproteins that might normally occur after endocytosis of the virus. If the glycoproteins undergo the proper conformational changes, the membranes of two adjacent cells may fuse, forming a syncytium. We found that several cell types formed syncytia following expression of the RVFV glycoproteins and brief treatment at pH 5.2, including 293T/17 cells, HeLa cells, FLK cells, Huh-7 and HepG2 liver cells, CHO cells, and Vero cells (Fig. 2\nand data not shown). Syncytia formation was not observed when cells were maintained at neutral pH nor was fusion observed when cells infected with a control VRP expressing no glycoproteins (vector 3014) were incubated at either low or neutral pH (Fig. 2).

However, due to the ability of alphavirus replicons to inhibit host protein synthesis after infection (Kaariainen and Ranki, 1984), multiple approaches that relied upon the expression of a reporter gene subsequent to cell\u2013cell fusion failed. Therefore, we explored the use of the \u03b2-galactosidase \u03b1-complementation-based fusion assay. In this assay, the alpha subunit of \u03b2-galactosidase is expressed in one cell population, while the omega subunit is expressed in another. If fusion between the cell populations occurs after they are mixed, the alpha and omega subunits (produced prior to cell\u2013cell fusion) assemble and functional \u03b2-galactosidase is formed, the activity of which can be readily quantified following cell lysis and addition of a chemiluminescent substrate (Holland et al., 2004). By expressing the relatively stable omega subunit in 293T/17 cells 24 h prior to infection with an alphavirus replicon vector, we reasoned that sufficient protein would remain following alphavirus-induced host\u2013cell protein synthesis shut-off such that fusion could still be assayed.",

RVFV glycoprotein-induced cell\u2013cell fusion was inhibited by trypsin treatment of the target cells, indicating that the receptor(s) for RVFV is typsin-sensitive (Fig. 5\n). NiV was used as a positive control since ephrin-B2, the receptor for NiV (Bonaparte et al., 2005, Negrete et al., 2005), is a trypsin-sensitive protein (Bossart et al., 2001, Eaton et al., 2004). As seen in Fig. 5, NiV glycoprotein-induced cell\u2013cell fusion was inhibited at both pH 5.2 and pH 7.4 by trypsin treatment of the target cells. This effect was not the product of nonspecific toxicity of the trypsin treatment because VSV-G-induced cell\u2013cell fusion was not affected, which agrees with previously published reports that the VSV cellular receptor is not protease sensitive (Schlegel et al., 1983) (Fig. 5).

For a cell\u2013cell fusion assay to be developed, either the viral glycoproteins need to be expressed on the cell surface or large amounts of virus need to be added to the outside of cells to induce fusion-from-without. Since we sought to develop an assay that would enable us to manipulate the viral glycoproteins to test structural and functional hypotheses, we investigated approaches that would result in delivery of RVFV GN and GC to the cell surface. Gerrard and Nichol have shown that, when coexpressed, both GN and GC are delivered to the Golgi by virtue of a targeting signal present within the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GN. Interestingly, some GN reached the cell surface under their conditions, raising the possibility that the RVFV glycoproteins are localized to the Golgi at least in part by a retrieval mechanism from the cell surface (Gerrard and Nichol, 2002). If so, then overexpression of the glycoproteins could alter the steady state distribution of GN and GC such that sufficient levels are attained on the plasma membrane for the induction of cell\u2013cell fusion. Indeed, the distribution of several cellular proteins that reside in the Golgi can be altered upon overexpression, resulting in enhanced delivery to the cell surface (Bos et al., 1993, Linstedt et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Expression of the RVFV GN and GC polyprotein from an alphavirus vector resulted in readily detectable surface expression of these molecules. The alphavirus replicon technology can be used to express a variety of proteins, including other viral glycoproteins that are not naturally targeted to the cell surface and are therefore difficult to manipulate in cell\u2013cell fusion or pseudovirion assays (Heise et al., 2003, Thompson et al., 2006). Cells expressing the RVFV glycoproteins on the cell surface formed syncytia when incubated at mildly acidic pH, suggesting that this virus utilizes one or more endocytic pathways for cellular infection, with endosomal pH playing a critical role in inducing the fusion reaction. Other members of the Bunyaviridae family for which acid pH dependence has been shown include La Crosse, Hantaan, and California encephalitis viruses (Gonzalez-Scarano, 1985, Gonzalez-Scarano et al., 1984, Hacker and Hardy, 1997, Jacoby et al., 1993, Ronka et al., 1995). Thus, the fact that RVFV glycoproteins induced cell\u2013cell fusion at low pH is not surprising. However, it remains to be determined if RVFV needs other cellular factors in addition to low pH for membrane fusion to occur. For example, the SARS coronavirus (Simmons et al., 2005) and Ebola virus (Chandran et al., 2005) envelope proteins require a low-pH dependent endoproteolytic cleavage event in order for fusion to be elicited, while the ASLV envelope protein must first bind to its specific receptor, which triggers conformational changes in the envelope protein that render it competent to elicit membrane fusion upon subsequent exposure to low pH (Mothes et al., 2000). Since cell surface RVFV glycoproteins were capable of eliciting efficient cell\u2013cell fusion, it is less likely that proteolytic activation of either GN or GC is a required triggering event, though this possibility cannot be ruled out. Whether binding to a specific receptor might be needed prior to acid treatment is also not known and cannot be addressed at present since the receptor(s) for RVFV is unknown.",

This correlates with data from fusion-from-without assays using La Crosse virus, which induces syncytia formation at temperatures above 25 \u00b0C (Pobjecky et al., 1986). Furthermore, the growth of many members of the Bunyaviridae family, including Tahyna virus (Danielova, 1975), is decreased at incubation at lower temperatures in cell culture. Experiments examining the susceptibility of Culex pipiens and Aedes fowleri mosquitoes to RVFV determined that adult mosquitoes held at lower temperatures (13\u201319 \u00b0C) were less susceptible to RVFV infections, which correlates with our data indicating less RVFV-induced fusion at lower temperatures (Brubaker and Turell, 1998, Turell, 1989, Turell et al., 1985); however, there is no evidence that fusion efficiency is the only factor in mosquito susceptibility to RVFV infection.",

Several reports have shown that some neutralizing anti-RVFV antibodies do not block virus binding to the cell (Besselaar and Blackburn, 1992, Besselaar and Blackburn, 1994), a phenomenon also seen with Dugbe virus, a member of the Nairovirus genus (Green et al., 1992). In the context of a cell\u2013cell fusion assay, the presence of antibodies may not completely block the proximity of the overexpressed RVFV glycoproteins to the target cell membrane. Therefore, when the pH is lowered, conformational changes triggered in the glycoproteins may still induce cell\u2013cell fusion even when antibodies are present. Furthermore, a large amount of antibody was necessary for inhibition of the Hantaan virus cell\u2013cell fusion assay (Ogino et al., 2004), indicating inefficient inhibition of cell\u2013cell fusion. This phenomenon has also been seen for other virus families; for example, higher concentrations of entry inhibitors are necessary to block HIV cell\u2013cell fusion when compared to inhibition of infection (Reeves et al., 2005).",

As noted previously, some acid-dependent viruses require specific receptors, whereas others can elicit fusion with artificial membranes at low pH, thus demonstrating that the presence of host cell proteins is not required (Corver et al., 2000, White and Helenius, 1980). To further explore the target cell requirements for RVFV glycoprotein-mediated fusion, we treated target cells with trypsin and found that this largely abolished RVFV-dependent membrane fusion, though it did not affect fusion elicited by VSV-G. This indicates that a host cell surface protein or protein-associated carbohydrate is necessary for RVFV cell\u2013cell fusion, and perhaps for virus infection as well. Currently, we are in the process of analyzing a more extensive panel of proteases for their effects on RVFV fusion.",

The development of this quantitative cell\u2013cell fusion assay will make it possible to more fully explore the conditions needed for RVFV-induced membrane fusion, to study the structure\u2013function relationships of the viral glycoproteins, and to screen for small molecules that block RVFV entry or fusion that could be used as antiviral drugs.",
