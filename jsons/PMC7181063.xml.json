            "text": "For decades, nucleosides and nucleotides have formed the cornerstone of antiviral, antiparasitic and anticancer therapeutics and have been used as tools in exploring nucleic acid structure and function. [1,2] This phenomenon is a direct result of their close structural similarity to naturally occurring nucleosides. As such, any changes to their diverse scaffolds can have profound effects. In general, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues target key biological pathways in the replication cycles of many diseases; however, some have also been shown to target human enzymes, which can sometimes result in harmful consequences. In that regard, this Special Issue will focus on some of the leading approaches towards design, synthesis and biological investigations, as well as the various applications for this highly relevant class of compounds.

Another highly unique nucleoside scaffold is the focus of one of the contributions from the Seley-Radtke group. The innovative fleximers have shown potent activity against two coronaviruses - SARS and MERS [4], as well as filoviruses such as Ebola, Sudan and Marburg.
