This goal of assembling a protein fold library required improvements in both structural biology\u2019s technology and methodology, so the goals included development of methodology and technology to enable high-throughput structure determination and subsequent automation of unique protein structures.

See [993], for example, urging termination of PSI, and an opposing view from some involved scientists [87].

Wensley et al. probed the reasons for different folding profiles of the protein domains of \u03b1-spectrin, a protein of the intracellular matrix of red blood cells important for membrane elasticity. Prior experimental studies have shown that the R15 domain folds very quickly, roughly 3000 times faster than its homologues R16 and R17. Because the structures are similar, the reason for this behavior was not apparent. By swapping domains through chimeric constructs, the researchers demonstrated that protein landscape roughness, or internal friction resulting from residue-specific interactions that can lead to misdocking of helices, causes slow folding and unfolding of the R16 and R17 domains of \u03b1-spectrin. For this membrane protein, slow unfolding kinetics are advantageous because they imply fewer rearrangements during the cell\u2019s lifetime; this, in turn, decreases potential degradation. Thus, besides producing important experimental evidence and insights into folding/unfolding pathways, this work underscores the value of theory in understanding biomolecular structures, dynamics, and pathways. Biomolecular modeling is well on its way to becoming a full partner to experiment and a field on its own right [1464].",

Specifically, the CASP organizers assign certain proteins for theoretical prediction that protein crystallographers and NMR spectroscopists expect to complete by the next CASP meeting. Prediction assessors then consider several categories of structural prediction tools, for example: template based modeling for tertiary structure prediction; template free modeling for tertiary structure prediction; side chain, loop, and active-site prediction for high resolution models; high accuracy modeling; disordered protein-region identification; domain-boundary identification; function prediction; and more. Evaluators assess how well various in silico approaches such as comparative (homology) modeling or ab initio prediction (i.e., using first principles) perform.",

For example, when the quality of the prediction is characterized in terms of C\u03b1 root-mean-square (RMS) deviations, the best values obtained \u2014 in the lower part of the range of 2\u20136 \u00c5 \u2014 are from the best comparative modeling approaches.",

Furthermore, the accuracy of models predicted by automatic servers is approaching that of manual manipulation, lending promise to the notion that ultimately every interested individual might be able to automate such protein folding predictions on her/his desktop. Automation and rapid folding simulations can make possible applications to enzyme design, such as done with the Rosetta program; see [609], for example. Still, recognizing entirely novel folds remains a challenge, as well as predicting secondary structures and long-range contacts. Template-free or ab initio modeling has shown more modest general improvements, pointing to needed new ideas; nonetheless it is encouraging that such methods can occasionally perform very well on some targets.",

Examples include DNA and RNA-binding regions of certain protein complexes (e.g., basic region of leucine zipper protein GCN4, DNA-binding domain of NFATC1, RNA recognition regions of the HIV-1 Rev protein).

Moreover, the window of opportunity for the immune system to clear the initial infection is very narrow, because the virus quickly integrates itself into the host. The mechanisms of drug resistant mutations and the interactions among them are still not well understood despite enormous amount of research, and fundamental questions about the progression of HIV disease and the host response to the virus remain unanswered [91, 612].",

In these analogues, a certain region of the known thrombin inhibitor was substituted by hydrophobic ligands so as to bind better to a certain enzyme pocket that emerged crucial for the fit. Further modeling helped select a subset of these ligands that showed extremely compact thrombin/enzyme structures; this compactness helps oral absorption of the drug.

Nutrigenomics, at the interface of genomics, nutrition, and health, was made possible by recent developments in high-throughput transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics technologies. Nutrigenomics integrates the genomics sciences with nutrition by studying how nature (the presence of particular genes or mutations) and nurture (our food intake, given environmental and behavioral factors) interact to manifest disease or protect us from it.",

More generally, nutrition modifies the extent to which certain genes are expressed because macro-nutrients like proteins, micro-nutrients like vitamins, and naturally-occurring bioactive molecules like flavonoids regulate gene expression. Some of these compounds like resveratrol in red wine are ligands for transcription factors, and others like the natural amine nutrient choline \u2014 found in the lipids that make up cell membranes and in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine \u2014 alter signal transduction pathways and chromatin structure, thereby also affecting gene expression epigenetically. Because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can alter gene functions, much of the focus in nutrigenomics has been on how the interaction of nutrients with SNPs increase or decrease disease risk.",

More generally, key nutrients like folate, vitamin E, vitamin B12, niacin, or calcium are associated with a reduction in DNA damage, while riboflavins and biotin tend to increase such damage. The familiar advice to lower fat intake and increase amounts of cruciferous vegetables can be rationalized by the lowering by these agents of oxidative DNA damage, which occurs from environmental factors like tobacco smoke and dietary factors like ultra high-fat diets. Thus, folate and other antioxidants and phytochemicals are recommended because they enhance DNA repair and reduce oxidative DNA damage. Such dietary modifications can help compensate for inherited mutations that may impair DNA damage repair. Because of this connection between DNA damage/repair and nutrition, some cancer researchers have become particularly interested in nutrigenomics.",
