A 64-year-old physician from southern China, who had visited Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 and died 10 days later of severe pneumonia, is believed to have been the source of infection causing subsequent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada [1\u20134]. By the end of the epidemic in July 2003, there had been 8,096 cases reported in 29 countries and regions, with a mortality incidence of 774 (9.6 %) [5]. Among the 8,096 cases, 1,706 were health care workers (HCWs). A novel coronavirus (CoV) was responsible for SARS [6]. Bats are likely the natural reservoirs of SARS-like CoV [7, 8].",

Phase 1 (viral replication) is associated with an increasing viral load during the first week of the illness and is clinically characterized by fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms that generally diminish after a few days. Phase 2 (immunopathological injury) is characterized by recurrence of fever, hypoxemia, and radiological progression of pneumonia with falls in viral load during the second week of illness. The high morbidity associated with SARS was highlighted by the observation that even when only 12 % of the total lung field is involved by consolidation on chest radiographs, 50 % of patients require supplemental oxygen to maintain satisfactory oxygenation above 90 % [10]. Peiris et al. [9] showed peaking of the nasopharyngeal viral load on day 10 of illness followed by a progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from the nasopharynx, in stool, and in urine from day 10 to day 21 after symptom onset in 20 patients who had serial measurements with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Thus, clinical worsening of patients with SARS during phase 2 (second week of illness) is most likely the result of immune-mediated lung injury due to an overexuberant host response rather than uncontrolled viral replication [9].",

During the global outbreak of SARS, about 20 % of patients progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating invasive ventilatory support while reaching a very high viral load at the nasopharynx with the peak on day 10 of illness [9]. Thus, HCWs were particularly prone to infection while caring for patients at a close distance [1, 9, 12]. These data emphasize the need for adequate respiratory protection in addition to strict contact and droplet precautions when managing patients with pneumonia due to highly infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Several uncontrolled studies have shown that single-circuit noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be life-saving for patients in respiratory failure due to SARS infection [13\u201315]. Among 120 patients meeting clinical criteria for SARS who were in a hospital for infectious diseases in Beijing, 30 (25 %) had developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) at 10.7 \u00b1 3.8 days after the onset of SARS. Among these 30 patients, 16 (53 %) exhibited hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg), and 10 hypercapnic events occurred within 1 week of admission. NIV was instituted in 28 patients, with 1 patient intolerant of it. In the remaining 27 patients with SARS, NIV was initiated 1.2 \u00b1 1.6 days after ARF onset. An hour of NIV therapy led to significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 and a reduced respiratory rate (p < 0.01). Endotracheal intubation was required in one-third of the patients (9/27) despite a favorable response to NIV initially. Remarkable pulmonary barotrauma was noted in 7 of the 120 patients (5.8 %) and in 6 of those (22 %) on NIV. The overall fatality rate at 13 weeks was 6.7 % (8/120). It was higher (26.7 %) among those needing NIV. None of the HCWs contracted SARS. The authors concluded that NIV is a feasible, appropriate treatment for ARF due to SARS infection [13].",

The mean age of the patients was 51.4 years. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 5.35. SARS CoV serology was positive in 19 of 20 patients (95 %). NIV was started at a mean of 9.6 days from symptom onset. The mean duration of NIV usage was 84.3 h. Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70 %), in whom the ICU stay was shorter than those who required intubation (3.1 vs. 21.3 days, p < 0.001), and the chest radiography score within 24 h of NIV was lower (15.1 vs. 22.5, p = 0.005) compared to the intubated patients. Intubation avoidance was predicted by a marked reduction in respiratory rate (9.2 breaths per min) and supplemental oxygen requirement (3.1 L/min) within 24 h of NIV. There were no clinical infections among the 105 HCWs caring for the 20 patients receiving NIV, and 102 HCWs who had consented to blood serology testing were all negative for SARS CoV. NIV appeared effective in the treatment of ARF in the patients with SARS, and its use was safe for HCWs in this single-center study [14].",

The two hospital groups had comparable demographics and clinical profiles, but patients at the NIV hospital (n = 42) had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and worse radiographic scores on admission. Compared to the IMV hospitals (n = 451), the NIV hospital had lower adjusted odds ratios (OR) for intubation [0.36, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.164\u20130.791, p = 0.011] and death (0.235, 95 % CI 0.077\u20130.716, p = 0.011). There was no clinical transmission of SARS among HCWs caused by the use of NIV. Compared to IMV, NIV as the initial ventilatory support for ARF in the presence of SARS appeared to be safe.

Experimental studies based on a sophisticated human patient simulator and laser visualization technique have shown that the maximum exhaled air particle dispersion distance from patients receiving NIV via the ResMed Ultra Mirage mask was about 0.5 m along the exhalation port [22]. The same research group demonstrated that the maximum exhaled air dispersion distance from the Respironics ComfortFull 2 mask was about 1 m at a predictable direction from the exhalation diffuser perpendicular to the patient. Leakage though the Respironics Image 3 mask, connected to the whisper swivel exhalation port, was much more extensive and diffuse even at a low IPAP of 10 cmH2O [23]. The whisper swivel is an efficient exhalation device to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing, but it is not advisable to use such an exhalation port when managing patients with highly infectious conditions such as SARS for fear of causing major nosocomial infection. It is also important to avoid the use of high IPAP, which could lead to wider distribution of exhaled air and substantial room contamination [23]. These data have important clinical implications regarding the prevention of any future nosocomial outbreaks of SARS and other highly infectious conditions such as pandemic influenza.",

The organisms can spread via either deliberate or accidental mask interface leakage and flow compensation causing dispersion of contaminated aerosol [24]. In patients with respiratory failure undergoing NIV via nasal masks, air leakage may occur through the mouth or routes other than the exhalation valve [25]. For example, the patient may loosen the mask strap to relieve discomfort around the nasal bridge, and air leakage from the nasal bridge is definitely a potential source for transmission of viral infection. Careful mask fitting is important for successful, safe application of NIV [24]. Addition of a viral/bacterial filter to the breathing system of NIV between the mask and the exhalation port [13\u201315] or using dual-circuit NIV may reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of viral infection [22].",

Indeed, SARS-related ARF has been reported to respond readily to low positive pressures with CPAP (4\u201310 cmH2O), IPAP (<10 cmH2O), and EPAP of (4\u20136 cmH2O) [26].
