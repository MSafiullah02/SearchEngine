All three have been identified as betacoronaviruses. One Health is the concept that human, animal and environmental health are linked. It provides a useful framework for examining and dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases such as coronaviruses. In 2005, Lau et al. 2 identified a coronavirus in non-caged Chinese horseshoe bats, which was closely related to the SARS-CoV isolated from civet cats and humans. Two years later, Cheng et al. 3 concluded that the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. Surveillance of wild animals such as bats provides important information about potential zoonotic disease threats. Integrating scientific findings into effective public policies to prevent zoonotic spillover events remains aspirational, as the current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates.",

Cases of atypical pneumonia began appearing in November 2002 in the Guangdong province, but the disease was not identified as SARS until a month later. 4 Unfortunately, the Chinese government did not report the worsening outbreak to WHO until 3 months after it began, hindering containment efforts and ultimately contributing to its 8-month cumulative total of 8096 laboratory-confirmed cases and 774 deaths with a case-fatality rate of 9.6%. 5 MERS appeared in Saudi Arabia 9 years after the SARS epidemic ended. Dromedary camels were identified as the source of the virus; however, a number of bat species are theorized to be the reservoir host animals for coronaviruses. 6 SARS disappeared, but MERS has continued to circulate and, as of November 2019, has caused 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 deaths. Its case-fatality rate is 34.4%. 7 In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Pangolins had been suspected as the intermediate hosts; however, genetic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 did not come directly from these endangered animals. 8, 9 In contrast to SARS, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified relatively quickly. Cases of atypical pneumonia appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei province, at the end of December 2019. In 1 week the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, was determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the causative agent. Five days after that, the virus's genome sequence was released online on 12 January 2020 to assist ",

These zoonotic viruses come from animals sold for food or medicinal purposes. Ideally, endangered exotic animals should be banned from such use, especially animals identified as reservoir or intermediate hosts in pathogen surveillance studies. 12 The current COVID-19 crisis has prompted China to ban the trade of wildlife for food but not for medicinal purposes. 13 Whether or not this ban is effective in stopping zoonotic disease transmissions remains to be seen. A black market developed the last time China tried to ban wild animal trading, after the SARS crisis. 14 Protecting wildlife habitats such as tropical rainforests would be another important strategy to prevent zoonotic pathogen spillover events. 15 Second, understanding the epidemiological characteristics of the novel agent is critical for successful containment. With an estimated basic reproductive rate (R 0 ) of 2.2, SARS-CoV-2 is much more communicable than SARS or MERS and can be transmitted person to person by symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, similarly to influenza. The virus can persist on some surfaces for up to 72 h. These features have allowed the virus to spread efficiently.",
