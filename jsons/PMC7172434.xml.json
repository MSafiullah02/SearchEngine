            "text": "Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) cause substantial harm to hospitalized neonates. They have considerable health and economic consequences, including increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS) and increased medical costs.1 In North America, it is estimated that each episode of sepsis prolongs the duration of a neonate's hospital stay by two weeks, resulting in an incremental cost of US$25,000 per episode. In a recent study of very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants, nosocomial BSIs were found to increase hospitalization costs by 26% for infants weighing 401\u2013750 g and by 80% for infants weighing 1251\u20131500 g. This study also showed that the LOS increased by four to seven days in all VLBW categories with nosocomial bloodstream infections.2 Infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are at high risk of HCAIs. They are exposed to specific and non-specific risk factors that increase the risk of bacterial and fungal sepsis, including the frequent use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, parenteral nutrition, acid inhibitors and steroids, as well as the systematic and long-term use of invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs) and endotracheal tubes.3 Preterm neonates in NICUs are at greater risk of infection due to low birth weight and intestinal disorders with proliferation of a pathogenic microflora. Moreover, nursing in incubators may delay or impair normal intestinal colonization. Neonates are more susceptible to infection because they lack an effective skin barrier, and have immature or ineffective immune systems, allowing invasion by many organisms from various colonized sites.4, 5\n",

Although a small proportion of neonates acquire CoNS by vertical transmission, acquisition is primarily horizontal by cross-transmission.11 Consequently, infants admitted to a hospital acquire most of their micro-organisms from the hospital environment, their parents and staff.12 Transmission via the hands of hospital staff can lead to endemic strains circulating for extended periods. As CoNS are ubiquitous skin commensal bacteria, it has been assumed that colonization of the skin and of indwelling catheters are important sources of sepsis.13 However, recent studies have suggested that epithelial loci other than the skin, such as the nares, may be important access points of infection.13 Antibiotic resistance in skin-residing strains has been found to be low at birth, but increases rapidly during the first week of hospitalization.14 Therefore, selective pressure as a result of perinatal antibiotic exposure is a major factor influencing the spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of micro-organisms isolated from neonates.",

BSIs are the result of interaction of several factors related to clinical care practices and characteristics of the patient population.15 The presence of a CVC is a major risk factor for BSI. The 1999 prevalence survey in the USA found that infants with central intravascular catheters had a birthweight-adjusted relative risk of 3.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32\u20136.26, P<0.001].6 CoNS are responsible for 50% of catheter-related infections. Interpretation of a positive blood culture is difficult as CoNS are skin commensals. The diagnosis is usually uncertain due to the non-specific signs of sepsis in this population and the definition of central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) used in neonates. The diagnosis is often based on a single positive blood culture and clinical signs, despite the fact that many experts recommend obtaining both central line and peripheral blood cultures. A recent systematic review found significant variability in the reporting of BSI and CLABSI rates in NICUs, and confirmed that CLABSI rates are more challenging to collect.16 As such, it may be more appropriate to use BSI rates to monitor HCAIs in some NICU settings.",

Data suggest that the hub is the common source of contamination and subsequent infection.17 The risk of CLABSI is related to the duration of catheter use and the frequency of catheter manipulation.18 Many strategies have been developed in adults to prevent and reduce these HCAIs by using care bundles.19 Reducing CLABSI should be based on implementation of clinical practice guidelines for the insertion and maintenance of catheters. Improvement consists of five care steps: maximal barrier precautions upon insertion; chlorhexidine skin antisepsis; optimal catheter site selection; optimal catheter site selection; and daily review of the need for the line, with prompt removal of unnecessary lines.20 Several institutions have published the results of multi-faceted interventions to reduce CLABSI rates. A NICU centre conducted an educational programme aimed at reinforcing hand hygiene, and developed and implemented a checklist for care of the catheter hub. This led to a decrease in the CLABSI rate from 23 to 12 infections per 1000 catheter-days [odds ratio (OR) 0.33; 95% CI 0.20\u20130.90], and a decrease in the umbilical CLABSI rate from 15 to 5 infections per 1000 catheter-days (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.17\u20130.91).21 A recent literature review20 showed that bundle implementations are effective for the reduction of CLABSI in NICUs.",

Indeed, the risk of VAP is significantly higher below 28 weeks of gestation. Many risk factors for the development of HAP in NICU patients are similar to those identified in adult patients, such as prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, severe underlying cardiopulmonary disease and previous thoraco-abdominal surgery.23 Most bacterial healthcare-associated lower respiratory tract infections occur due to aspiration of bacteria from the oropharynx or the gastrointestinal tract. Uncuffed endotracheal tubes facilitate access of micro-organisms to the lower respiratory tract. Neonates with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those who have impaired swallowing mechanisms are at increased risk of aspiration.24\n",

General concepts of prevention include: staff education and training; microbiological surveillance; prevention of cross-transmission (improving hand hygiene); and early removal of mechanical ventilation. In adult populations, a bundle including various steps for ventilator care has been developed successfully25: hand hygiene and compliance with use of gloves and gowns; elevation of the head-end of the bed by 30\u201340\u00b0; maintenance of tracheal cuff pressure; avoidance of gastric overdistension; use of orogastric tubes; good oral hygiene; and elimination of non-essential tracheal suction. Compliance with all of these measures seems to be correlated with a decrease in the incidence of VAP.25 Unlike in the adult population, no studies on VAP bundles in neonates have been published in the last 10 years. However, a recent study suggested that tracheal colonization by oropharyngeal bacteria was less common among neonates with mechanical ventilation when they are placed in a lateral position compared with a supine position.26 Moreover, keeping the endotracheal tube and the ventilator circuit in a horizontal position may reduce tracking of oropharyngeal secretions into the lower respiratory tract.27 The lateral position is also associated with reduced aspiration of gastric secretions into the trachea. As such, use of a non-supine position may reduce the risk of VAP.",

Improved survival of VLBW and premature infants has led to the emergence of a population that is highly susceptible to infection. Many factors are involved in the development of HCAIs in neonates, such as immunological immaturity, frequent use of invasive procedures and prolonged hospitalization. Several infection prevention strategies have been in place for decades and are summarized below.44\n\u2022Improving hand hygiene is one of the most important interventions and should be a primary goal of any NICU. Successful interventions include education, monitoring, performance feedback, reminders and motivation of healthcare workers.45\n\u2022Prevention of CVC infection is based firstly on reducing the duration of catheterization and avoiding unnecessary use of catheters. Precautions during insertion and management of catheters are also crucial.\u2022Unnecessary and prolonged empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy selects resistant bacteria and increases the risk of invasive fungal infections. Developing appropriate strategies to limit the use of antibiotics is the most effective way to reduce nosocomial infections due to multi-drug-resistant organisms.46\n\u2022Successful management and prevention of outbreaks requires sufficient facilities for cohorting colonized and infected infants. The spread of multi-drug-resistant organisms is exacerbated by inadequate spacing between cots, high occupancy rates and low nurse\u2013infant ratios. Optimal staffing ratios for neonatal nurses appear to reduce HCAIs and mortality in neonates.47 As environmental contamination is an important reservoir of antibiotic-selected organisms, it seems important to reduce environmental contamination by using equipment dedicated to each infant and enhancing routine cleaning.48\n\n",

Strategies to reduce HCAIs in NICUs should be based on specific bundles of care, as in adults, including improving hand hygiene, avoiding unnecessary use of catheters, appropriate use of antiseptics and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy.
