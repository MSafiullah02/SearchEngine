The dried gel pieces were re-hydrated by adding 10 \u03bcl of digestion buffer (50 mM NH4HCO3) containing 0.5 \u03bcg of trypsin. After allowing 30 min for gel pieces to completely absorb the solution, an additional 200 \u03bcl of digestion buffer without trypsin was added to fully immerse the gel pieces. Digestion continued for about 16 h at 37 \u00b0C. The digestion buffer, now containing extracted peptides, was carefully removed and transferred into a clean microfuge tube.

The soluble fraction was loaded onto the Ni2+ -NTA affinity column, and the homogeneous protein was successfully purified with elution buffer after washing thoroughly. The purified protein was further analyzed with His-tag monoclonal antibody, and a specific blot band was detected at the corresponding position (Fig. 3B). The predicted molecular mass of the SARS-nsp13 protein was 33.4 kDa, and there were 30 additional amino acids for the His-tag in the N-terminal of the expressed fusion protein. These extra amino acids increased molecular mass of the expressed target protein by about 3.3 kDa. Apparent molecular mass of the purified protein was about 37 kDa, which was expected. The yield from 200 ml of bacterial culture was about 1.3 mg of purified SARS-nsp13 protein after a single Ni2+ affinity chromatographic step. The recovery of SARS-nsp13 protein was about 26% (Table 1\n).",
