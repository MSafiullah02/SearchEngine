However, because of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, the prone position is being increasingly used for both critically ill sedated patients and less-sick spontaneously breathing patients1. All of this will likely result in more prone cardiac arrests, posing a new challenge for healthcare workers. While conducting a scoping review of prone resuscitation, we discovered variation in how compressions were performed. We have highlighted four cases because they offer clinical insights, and because they helped us develop a solution: offered below and without cost.",

This was associated with sustained systolic pressures in the 120 mmHg range. Mazer et al. performed prone compressions on six ICU patients using two-hands compressing the T7-10 vertebrae, atop a 4.5 kg sandbag on a rigid board3. Burki et al.\u2019s case report described two prone compression methods using cushions for sternal counter-pressure: the first using one-hand on the midthoracic spine, the second using bilateral open palms between the scapula and thoracic spine4. Finally, in a mannequin simulation, Atkinson used a gel pad beneath the patient's breastbone to offer sternal support during reverse compressions5. The gel pad was produced after preliminary studies suggested that without sternal support it would be difficult to obtain successful compression depth, thereby resulting in poor quality prone compressions. The take home from these studies is that sternal counter-pressure and a hard surface are required.",

During development, our team performed and tracked the quality of 6600 compressions on a prone Laerdal Resusci Anne QCPR manikin. Adding the sternal counter-pressure increased the sternal depth of compressions from 2889 (44%) in the target range to 5541 (84%) (target range four to five centimetres). Participant feedback also suggested that adequate compressions (i.e. those that achieved target depth) were less fatiguing with the rigid board and sternal ridge.
