In particular, N protein binds to a defined packaging signal on viral RNA, leading to the formation of the helical nucleocapsid (Narayanan et al., 2003). A similar function of N protein has been found in other viruses, in addition to coronaviruses (Myers and Moyer, 1997). However, the mechanism by which N protein facilitates virus replication is not established. The N protein of SARS-CoV is 422 amino acids long, sharing only 20\u201330% homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). However, it contains a short lysine-rich sequence (362-KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ-381) near the carboxyl terminus, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal that has not been found in the N proteins of any other known coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003), suggesting the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein might have novel functions in pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV N protein has been reported to activate the activator protein 1 (AP1) signal transduction pathway (He et al., 2003) and to induce actin reorganization in COS-1 cells (Sutjit et al., 2004) by forming a dimmer by self-association (He et al., 2004).",

IL-6 expression is known to be affected by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. It has been reported that activation of IL-6 expression is controlled by the activity of several transcription factors with known consensus sequences in the IL-6 promoter region, including IRF-1 (\u2212 267 to \u2212 254), AP-1 (\u2212 283 to \u2212 277), C/EBP (\u2212 158 to \u2212 145 and \u2212 87 to \u2212 76), Sp1 (\u2212 123 to \u2212 119 and \u2212 108 to \u2212 104), and NF-\u03baB (\u2212 75 to \u2212 63) binding sites (Akira and Kishimoto, 1992, Yan et al., 1995). NF-\u03baB belongs to the Rel family of transcription factors that form homo- or heterodimers through the Rel homology domain (Akira and Kishimoto, 1997, Sen and Baltimore, 1986). In most cells, NF-\u03baB is present in the cytoplasm bound to a member of the I\u03baB family of inhibitors (Verma et al., 1995, Carlotti et al., 2000). Upon activation of the cells by cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1, viruses, bacteria, or mitogens, I\u03baB is phosphorylated and then rapidly degraded allowing the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA binding sites.",

Chromatin fragments were prepared from A549 cells transfected with plasmid pCMV-Tag2B-N and immunoprecipitated with specific rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody. Two regions (region a: \u2212 225 to + 13 and region b: \u2212 76 to + 13) of IL-6 promoter containing the NF-\u03baB binding sequences were amplified by PCR using specific primers (Table 1\n), respectively. Results showed that PCR products were only produced from DNA isolated from cells transfected with pCMV-Tag2B-N in the presence of anti-N antibody (Fig. 5B, lane 4) or directly from input DNA (Fig. 5B, lane 1), but not detected in the presence of control plasmid (Fig. 5B, lane 2) and normal rabbit polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG) (Fig. 5B, lane 4) or without the treatment of anti-N antibody (Fig. 5B, lane 3). These results demonstrated that the N protein could specifically bind to the NF-\u03baB recognition site on the IL-6 promoter.",
