            "text": "Let us open with a simple question: how could postmodernism and its famous rejection of grand narratives possibly inform or advance epistemology, the study of truth itself, grand narrative par excellence? In his seminal work Knowledge in a Social World, Alvin I. Goldman goes so far as to accuse postmodernism of being fundamentally veriphobic. Arguing that postmodernists tend to \u201cdeliberately bracket questions of truth and falsity, holding that nothing legitimate can come of any attempt to draw distinctions in those terms\u201d (1999, p. 7), Goldman suggests that their enterprise is better classified as social doxology, a practice focused not on knowledge but on opinion or belief. Though I would argue that Goldman here drastically misunderstands what postmodernism attempts to achieve, in its veriphobic tendencies, one may nonetheless ponder how postmodernism and its emphasis on fluidity and idiosyncrasies, its fundamental rejection of universalism (a form of universalist statement in and of itself), may actually contribute to the epistemological edifice. In many ways, Goldman\u2019s concern with postmodernist theory lies precisely in the latter\u2019s challenging of such notions as truth and knowledge when such notions as belief and opinion are already readily available (1999, p. 8). But here again, Goldman appears to miss the point. Indeed, postmodernism is not necessarily intent on negating truth and knowledge, but raises the question, what do both notions allow or achieve, which justified or accepted belief cannot?",

And this is precisely what postmodernism has striven to expose\u2014that is, the illusionary dimension of said transcendentalism and its intrinsic effects of erasure. In the illusion of transparency lies the effect of a power whose oppressive capacity heavily relies on its ability to erase all signs of its own actual presence, to silence its own site of production. As such, postmodernism does not partake in the veriphobic move which Goldman assumes it does, but proposes instead a fundamental interrogation of the notion of truth and its role. Its suggested dissolution corresponds not to a shying away from truth but to a return to the original foundation of philosophical inquiry, a return to its logical and revolutionary essence. Driven by its desire to \u201cexamine the possibility of a point of interruption\u201d (Badiou 2003, p. 49), and remembering that desire invariably precludes the possibility of closure, this postmodernist inquiry amounts to nothing less than an epistemological meta-critique, an assessment of epistemology itself, and an appraisal of its foundations, instruments, and effects.",

            "text": "One may ponder, at this point, exactly what such critique may have to do with contagion and contagion theory, the object of the present volume. I would argue that it is precisely in the drawing of a parallel between epistemological and epidemiological practices and ideological foundations that we may locate the roots of such a critique. The intersection of epidemiology and epistemology is in no way a new phenomenon. Since its origins in late medieval and early modern medical discourse, the idea of contagion as an image system, a metaphorical and rhetorical instrument, has been heavily mobilized by theorists attempting to explain the mechanism underlying the transmission of ideas, beliefs, and emotions. And though its application has tended to be historically rather vague, its enlisting as a metaphorical foundation in the drafting of a new model of epistemic propagation actually allows for the construction of an alternative, comprehensive, and ethically assessable epistemological structure. Embracing the disruptive and transgressive nature of the virus, the fluid and transformative capacity of contagion, this chapter thus proposes to re-align epistemology and its quest for justified true belief within an ethical field of inquiry in which this quest can be re-framed not as a rooting process but as a decisional moment, one plagued by uncertainty yet itself the founding moment of the possibility of ethics.1 By re-articulating truth and knowledge as, respectively, illusionary and space of violent oppression, and by re-affirming the performative dimension of belief, this viral epistemic model opens up a new field of ethical assessment located in the irreducible gap haunting every epistemic re-iteration, a gap which, in turn, not only allows for the subversion of the epistemic machine itself but also signals the infinite epistemological responsibility of the subject introduced by each epistemic action.",

            "text": "Much work has already been done, within epistemology, on the social value of truth and knowledge,2 and though most traditional studies appear to take the value of truth as a fundamental evidence, one can find in the works of Philip Kitcher and Ernest Sosa two factors which might potentially counter the postmodernist argument for a dissolution of truth and knowledge altogether. First, the idea that truth and knowledge share a vital role in our daily actions, that \u201cto mark something out as an item of knowledge is to indicate that it can be depended on, used in practical activities or in further investigations\u201d (Kitcher 2002, pp. 404\u20135); second, the notion that truth and knowledge both signal a stability which volition and belief cannot (Sosa 2001, p. 58). What both Kitcher and Sosa appear to suggest here is not so much the necessity of truth and knowledge as their essentially apotropaic function. As Zygmunt Bauman (1994, pp. 3\u20134) suggests, \u201chuman beings exist in [a] never-ending, since never fully successful, effort to escape from Chaos,\u201d and it is precisely this Chaos which we attempt to thwart through the erection of different social structures. In many ways, then, truth and knowledge act as mystical instruments in our quest for freedom, a state itself threatened by the crippling and imprisoning effects of doubt and uncertainty.From this somewhat cynical conclusion arise two fundamental questions: (1) if truth and knowledge are both tied to action, and through it to ethics, are they truly necessary to ethically assess said action?; (2) do we, as a culture and a species, have anything to gain from hiding in the light of truth and refusing to confront what we deep down know the Chaos of life to be? In other words, is not the freeing power of truth that which ultimately paralyzes us most?",

            "text": "Over the past 15 years at least, Western discourse has been dominated by debates over such notions as risks, danger, threat, and security. Though the roots of these obsessive compulsions can certainly, in part, be imputed to the September 11, 2001 attacks, one glance at our recent epidemiological history would comfort even the most skeptical among us in the assumption that our world is, indeed, a dangerous one. From the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Asia, the 2004 H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 worldwide influenza pandemics, or the more recent resurgence of the Ebola virus in West Africa, each year appears to bring with it a new potential human\u2014and humanity\u2014killer. Within this context, our cultural obsession with security appears all but too comprehensible. As James Der Derian argues, in the face of a danger \u201cone seeks a security, in the form of a pledge, a bond, a surety\u201d (1993, p. 98), a pledge dependent on the stability brought about by such notions as truth and knowledge. As the title of a leaflet produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in April 2015 suggests\u2014\u201cWhat you need to know about Ebola\u201d (2015, my italics)\u2014knowledge operates, within risk-inducing situations, as an apotropaic instrument, a defense mechanism allegedly protecting individuals against physical and psychological harm.",

Furthermore, its ultimate end result tends not toward freedom, that which it seeks to affect, but imprisonment in a never-ending circle of re-assessment whose final effect can but be paralyzing. Exposing the apotropaic yet incapacitating effect of this drive is thus not to deny the value of truth. Truth is a stable foundation. In its fundamental relation to time, its repeatability, truth provides us with a secure ground upon which to build the vertical and additive structures of knowledge. Imagine indeed for a second what life would be if between each breath, the certainty of my biological compatibility with the air I breathe became something I was inclined to doubt; or if, when confronted with a fast and deadly virus, all members of the medical corps were required to not only re-discover the means at their disposal but test and re-test them until all single traces of doubts were absolutely dissolved, every single instance of a reliance on past, universal, or common knowledge abandoned. Faced with the repeated assaults of a reality whose fluidity can never entirely be negated, truth and knowledge appear to be the fundamental foundations of all our actions. But to claim that action heavily relies on the assumption of truth, of a certain stability in and over time, does not actually guarantee that such assumptions will be met. At best, it may suggest the illusion of endurance, the fantasized continuation of the event, leaving us nonetheless pondering, as Ludwig Wittgenstein did (1969, p. 12), whether any certainty \u201creally be greater for being checked twenty time?\u201d",

Indeed, though numerous theorists have attempted to provide an adequate definition of truth and its meaning, most epistemologists have so far been forced to recognize that truth cannot be explained without recourse to truth itself, thus enclosing any truth-based argument within an inescapable epistemic circularity. The primary objective of any epistemological meta-critique would therefore be to confront this problematic circularity. And I would argue that the answer may not be as complicated as it, at first, appears. In fact, the problem of truth lies in the simple fact that, though epistemology itself is responsible for the creation of the concept it purports to locate or explain, it also has tended to silence its own role in the foundation of this object. In other words, epistemology posits as its ground something it will never entirely be able to prove for the simple reason that it cannot prove the existence of what it itself invented without having recourse to any of the other instruments it used in this object\u2019s construction.",

As the virus problematizes the possibility of distinction between host and non-host, between life and non-life, contagion more largely exposes the inadequacy of our cultural desire for boundaries. Residing between, in the fluid indistinction characteristic of the point of contact where terms blur into each other, contagion uncovers the operations of culture and reveals the illusionary dimension of any and all distinctions. It loudly exposes the fact that, outside man and the boundaries man has erected for himself in order to make sense of the world, the division between organisms, between life and death, but also between concepts such as truth, knowledge, and belief is one whose ontological foundations is inherently void. As Sedgwick argues, we are, after all, \u201cworking, at best, with hypothetical constructs of our own devising\u201d (1973, p. 25). Their respective relevance and usefulness are thus only as valid as we make them be, a validity which, in the case of the virus tends quickly to amount to little if anything at all.",

Skepticism has, throughout history, taken many forms and given birth to many different brands of theory. And though most epistemologists may be justified in their reluctance to engage with its standard form, I would argue we may find in the writing of Sextus Empiricus a potential path toward an ethical epistemology. In his Outlines of Scepticism, Sextus voluntarily distances his own brand of skepticism from the standardized solipsistic argument supporting the impossibility of any access to truth or knowledge (2000, p. 3). Instead, skepticism, for Sextus, operates according to three axes: investigation, suspension, and aporia (2000, p. 4). Skepticism, he argues, lies in the suspension of judgment which is forced upon the subject when confronted with the possibility of the \u201cboth\u201d which traditional epistemology, in its emphasis on a unicity and division, cannot abide. In other words, what Sextus emphasizes here is precisely what a meta-critique proposes to address\u2014that is, the structures underlying the epistemological edifice, or, as he expresses itself, the idea that \u201cwhat we investigate is not what is apparent but what is said about what is apparent\u201d (2000, p. 8), not truth nor beliefs but the discourse and presuppositions surrounding these conceptions.",

And this argument is one which is difficult to refute. Indeed, the skeptics, in Sextus\u2019s definition, appear to essentially reject the risk inherent to philosophical inquiry. And though this argument may hold, I would argue that it also misunderstands the potential of such a theory, its capacity to reveal and expose the decision underlying every belief and, therefore, its call for a necessary re-framing of belief as a political and ethical action. In other words, the skeptic addresses the silenced foundational moment at the heart of epistemology that is the voluntary and arbitrary iteration of belief. Skepticism does not signal the removal of the foundations of judgment, as Wittgenstein suggests (1969, p. 81), but the possibility of its actualization, a rejection of the transcendental, a re-articulation of belief as decisional, and ultimately the inscription of epistemology into the realm of ethics.",

However, historically, virtue epistemology has paradoxically tended to shy away from engaging with skepticism. As Zagzebski and Fairweather argue, \u201cvirtue epistemologists prefer to leave skeptical worries aside in order to pursue a program that is not dominated by these worries\u201d (2001, p. 5). And one might easily understand why they chose to do so as skepticism tends toward inaction rather than action, the primordial object of any ethical inquiry. Virtue epistemology purports to assess the relation between knower and knowledge or, more precisely, between a knower and her alethic ends (Fairweather 2001, p. 64). Through this assessment, it proposes to re-articulate the quest for knowledge as a virtue, an epistemic obligation in itself. Virtue epistemology therefore introduces the notion of responsibility into the act of belief itself. In 1877 already, W.K. Clifford argued that \u201cit is not possible so to sever the belief from the action it suggests as to condemn the one without condemning the other\u201d (1877, p. 291).More than a relation of co-existence, however, virtue epistemology ultimately posits belief as an act in and of itself, an epistemic action whose consequences can themselves be assessed ethically. Whereas traditional epistemology has tended to conceive of knowledge and belief as a state of being, an end result rather than a process, one which precludes any potential form of responsibility as it inherently negates the agency posited by skepticism, virtue epistemology re-conceptualizes belief as the performative action of an epistemic subject. Yet, the notion of action also suggests agency as well as an agent, a knower whose act of belief can be perceived as controlled and willfully produced, an idea which most epistemologists appear to take issue with.3\n",

Indeed, gazing at their common structures, one is forced to recognize that the individual\u2019s epistemological system inherent to most epistemic theories operates according to an economy which, in many ways, replicates that of the immune system found in biological writings. Both heavily rely on a critical apparatus whose function is to recognize and appraise every new incursion based on its compatibility with the rest of the system and then authorize or deny it access if such an incursion threatens the viability of the whole structure. Similarly, we find within communities a similar apparatus functioning at the herd level, or a form of \u201cherd immunity\u201d (Wald 2008, p. 48) in which new biological and epistemological entries are granted or refused access based on the pre-existing pattern of immunity of the collective population. Think, for example, of the prevalence of irrational racist agendas within most cultures despite the current climate of globalization and miscegenation dominating most industrialized countries. How can one explain these collective beliefs and their reluctance to variation without recourse to a form of epistemological immune system, a structure whose function it is to assess every \u201cnew\u201d belief in relation to the existing epistemic structures of the subject and/or her community?",

Contagion invites the drawing of lines of contact between territories and signals the often-illusory nature of the boundaries we culturally impose upon the world. And though the current reigning image system governing contagion theory often conceives of it in military terms (Montgomery 1991, p. 347), emphasizing division and conflict, this perspective may in and of itself be perceived as an apotropaic or defensive mechanism erected against what contagion threatens most\u2014that is, the idea of boundary itself. Indeed, more than anything else, contagion exposes and reveals our inherent vulnerability. As Bashford and Hooker suggest, it \u201creaches over domains of nature and culture which we often want to understand, or have an investment in understanding, as separate\u201d (2001, p. 4). In its essence, it problematizes the possibility of ontology itself, the boundaries we set up in order to define, the categorical imperative essential to structuration, signaling instead dissolution, fluid and continuous transmission, a move toward what has been labeled the posthuman and its biotic community of interconnected \u201csubjects.\u201d4\n",

Its first effect is the implicit dissolution of the possibility of an externalist/internalist argument. As the boundaries of the subject dissolve, the strict separation posited by both theories between individual/internal and collective/external belief or knowledge finds itself re-framed as an interactive and co-dependent territory in which, as Clifford suggests, \u201cno one man\u2019s belief is in any case a private matter which concerns himself alone\u201d (1877, p. 292). There is, of course, nothing new in suggesting the collective nature of our belief structure, the reliance of our thinking process on the existence of a collective language. However, few epistemological studies have actively engaged with what I would argue to be the inherently collective and interactive dimension of belief. In his work On Certainty, Wittgenstein suggests such a re-conceptualization when he argues that \u201cto know\u201d is to always already claim a recognition by a collective of our position as \u201cknower\u201d (1969, p. 73), something echoed in Gerhart and Russell\u2019s definition of knowledge as \u201ccreated understanding\u201d (2002, p. 202) or in Davidson\u2019s articulation of objective truth as a product of communication (2004, p. 7). What all three studies imply is the rooting of truth and knowledge\u2019s transcendental dimension in a form of collective consciousness or, at least, acquiescence, the positing of a fundamental and essential distinction between individual and collective forms of belief, a distinction between, respectively, belief on the one hand and knowledge and truth on the other.",

Any claim to \u201cknowledge\u201d thus signals the impossibility of error, error being the privileged territory of belief. In other words, knowledge cannot abide error without being immediately transformed into something else. Postmodernist readers will instantly perceive how problematic this notion may be. Indeed, postmodernism\u2019s primary claim has tended to be a positioning of truth and knowledge as violently normative notions, a normative dimension surprisingly often openly recognized by epistemology itself. From its traditional reliance on an \u201cideal\u201d epistemic agent\u2014or as Bonjour puts it, one \u201cwith faculties that are identical to those of a normal human being\u201d (2002, p. 255, my italics)\u2014to its object itself\u2014that is, a quest for an ideal and unique end\u2014epistemology is suffused with normative principles whose primary effects are the silencing of any alternative claims to its own precious creations.

As he suggests instead, appeals to truth used as instruments of power or domination do not \u201cimply that truth is either nonexistent or deserving of neglect,\u201d but rather that \u201cmost of these appeals, in the domains just surveyed, were false, inaccurate, and even fraudulent,\u201d and that ultimately \u201cthe way to combat such appeals is to correct the errors and inaccuracies\u201d (1999, p. 34). Violence and oppression do not derive, for Goldman, from truth or knowledge but from false claims to said truth and knowledge. However, Goldman here once again misunderstands the nature of the violence and oppression which postmodernism has tended to perceive in any claim to truth and knowledge. A return to contagion theory and its metaphors helps us expose more clearly the violence contingent in these processes. Indeed, in many ways, the claim implied in epistemology\u2019s quest for truth mirrors the underlining ideology guiding our contemporary public health programs and measures. As Marcel Verweij and Angus Dawson suggest, \u201ccalling something a public health issue seems to imply that it concerns us all\u201d (2007, pp. 18\u201319). Public health\u2019s claim to universality, to the collective welfare or to a mythical \u201cpublic good\u201d indeed often bypasses, or clearly nullifies, any claim to private and individual safety. Its reliance on a continuous threat to the community allows the establishment of security measures which more often than not act as a naturalization of its own powers of oppression, silencing in the process the numerous decisions which have shaped its ideological basis and which underline its self-sustained structure of re-duplication. Like epistemology, it tends to cancel its own definitional role in the establishment of the structures which it then calls forth as the unfortunate but natural and necessary bases of its own normalizing effects.",

However, in this last section, I propose to explore the possibility opened up by skepticism and contagion theory for the constitution of a potential epistemological meta-critique\u2014that is, a positioning of the epistemological enterprise as a cultural, ethical, and political process in and of itself. Like Sextus himself, I need here to premise this proposition with a concession, a recognition that my position itself cannot constitute another truth claim without running precisely against what it purports to undertake. As such, it should not be taken as a model claiming transparency, nor does it assert its own superiority to any other epistemological structure. Instead, it proposes to recognize its own ethical positioning, its own responsibility as a model of thought, as a belief system itself product of a series of decisions and further beliefs.",

Coherence theory proposes to re-articulate the individual subject\u2019s belief system as an extended network of interrelated beliefs, as a dynamic process of back-and-forth dialog between beliefs which can, in turn, assess every new addition; in other words, an epistemic immune system. Moving toward a form of posthumanist epistemology, this model appears to disrupt the vertical hierarchy upon which traditional epistemology relies and to replace it instead with a rhizomatic structure within which, as Clifford argues, \u201cno real belief, however trifling and fragmentary it may seem, is ever truly insignificant\u201d (1877, p. 292). Within this structure, the multiplicity of beliefs which constitute the system, and upon which the system ultimately relies for its definition, continuously make and re-make each other according to a mutational dynamic predicated on randomness and disorder. Like the virus whose process invariably involves grafting, assimilation to the point where recognition and distinction are rendered impossible, and mutation, beliefs function as an interruptive and transformative force whose effects are largely unpredictable and whose original foundations are themselves impossible to locate.",

Fiction and non-fiction would blur into each other and any distinction between them would be made fundamentally impossible. And indeed, the postmodernist critic may agree that fiction and its antithesis do partake of the same essence, and that, within a rhizomatic structure, one cannot rightfully elevate any belief above another. The question then arises of how one might assess belief, or a belief system, in the impossibility of any recourse to absolute and universal truth.

Indeed, if each iteration of belief bears within it the (crushing) weight of its own ethical responsibility, it also implies a similar burden weighing upon the collective body whose function and role it is to assess the compatibility of the individual\u2019s belief and belief system. If the individual agent\u2019s responsibility lies in the re-assessment, in each and every iteration of belief, of her own ethical responsibility in this iteration, a similar process must be involved in the collective assessment of her belief\u2019s position within the collective\u2019s own belief structure. This re-conceptualization thus posits a collective network of beliefs within which the individual agent\u2019s belief system not only emerges\u2014inasmuch as we assume thought itself to emerge within and through a collective process delimiting the conditions of its possibility\u2014but can also be ethically assessed. However, to presuppose this structure to be itself fixed in nature would once again be to return to the universalism which has tended to normalize (in all its implied violence) the study of epistemic responsibility.

Since every decision contains within itself the traces of its own alternative, every epistemic action is stained by the remaining memory of the inexistent, an opening up to an epistemic pluralism it never entirely manages to discard. Like a virus whose mutational force may remain dormant for years, waiting for a potential re-activation (Carter and Saunders 2007, p. 3), every belief emerges as the mutual and impossible co-presence of a positive and a negative. As such, the performative process involved in every epistemic action seems to echo the complex biological process involved in viral contagion\u2014that is, a process ripe with potentialities in which every form of bodily communication opens up a potential space of mutation. As new organisms enter the body of the biological subject in a state of pure potentiality\u2014every new organism contains within itself the potential to be either rejected as threat, assimilated as benign or, more perniciously and like the retrovirus, wrongfully incorporated only to later reveal its actual nefarious effects\u2014every belief iteration contains within itself the dual and simultaneous possibility of its own acceptance and rejection.
