While the Asia-Pacific region was generally regarded as the main epicenter of emerging infectious diseases, with outbreaks of Avian Flu, Asian Flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [1], the recent and unexpected emergence of Zika pandemic spurred global concerns about pandemic preparedness capabilities particularly as it relates to training and deployment of healthcare workforce at a massive level, worldwide. Despite coordinated global efforts, containing the \u201cred alert\u201d pandemic of Zika remained a challenge, as both healthcare workers and public health advocates were uncertain about such disastrous contagion causing serious complications including congenital microcephaly in newborns and neurological deficits in adults [2, 3].",

It was during this time that computers and internet-based knowledge began and has since then shaped human interactions.

At the peak of emergent multi-function contexts of AI and the rise of Big Data Analytics, the United Nations (UN) in 2017 unified global experts to galvanize a dynamic consensus on the adoption and expansion of AI use in delivering good public care services [8]. Succinctly, various stakeholders were assembled together in another UN meeting to assess the role of AI towards achieving Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) [9]. From the healthcare perspective, massive data have been obtained from public health surveillance efforts with the advancement of AI. One major public health field that gained momentum to develop various AI applications for disease prevention was the infectious disease domain [5]. The human population is currently able to access potentially useful massive data sources of infectious disease spread through sentinel reporting systems, national surveillance systems (usually operated by national or regional disease centers such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC)), genome databases, internet search queries (also called infodemiology and infoveillance studies) [10\u201312], Twitter data analysis [13, 14], outbreak investigation reports, transportation dynamics [15], vaccine reports [16] and human dynamics information [17].",

While human interpretation is solely dependent on cognitive functions, AI requires mathematical algorithms to automate machines for execution of such functions [18]. Machines here refer to programmable computers! An example is to visualize the cause of an outbreak; Dengue, Chikungunya or Zika, of which these diseases are commonly caused by the vector mosquito. In massive epidemics, elimination of the vector is important, and human cognitive functions can never detect all mosquitos in an outbreak investigation area! However, this can be easily detected through deployment of AI in areas which have loads of mosquito vectors to facilitate control measures.

The system identifies images of mosquito larvae captured and delivered by a group of citizen scientists. Not only did the developed prototype facilitate collection of images, it also facilitated training of image classifiers for the recognition of a particular specimen. This sets a base for execution of expert validation process and data analytics. It was found that recognition of specimen in images provided by citizen scientists was useful to generate visualizations of susceptible geographical regions of arboviruses threat (Fig. 5).

Correlations between the total number of new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly Google Trends index varied from weak to moderate among the African countries afflicted by Ebola. Correlations between the total number of Ebola cases registered in all countries and the Google Trends index was relatively high.

The 2017 Italian outbreak of Chikungunya posed substantial public health concerns, catalyzing public interests in terms of internet searches and social media interactions. A group of researchers were determined to investigate Chikungunya-related digital health-seeking behaviors, and subsequently explored probable associations between epidemiological data and internet traffic sources [27]. Public reactions from Italy toward Chikungunya outbreaks were mined from Google Trends, Google News, Twitter traffics, Wikipedia visits and edits, and PubMed articles to yield a structural equation model. The relationships between overall Chikungunya cases, as well as autochthonous cases and tweet productions were mediated by Chikungunya-related web searches. But in the allochthonous case model, tweet productions were not significantly mediated by epidemiological figures, instead, web searches posed significant mediating tweets. Inconsistent associations were detected in mediation models involving Wikipedia usage. The effects between news consumption and tweets production were suppressed in this regard. Subsequently, inconsistent mediation effects were found between Wikipedia usage and tweets production, with web searches as a mediator. After adjustment of Internet Penetration Index, similar findings were retrieved with the adjusted model showing relationship between Google News and Twitter to be partially mediated by Wikipedia usage. The link between Wikipedia usage and PubMed/MEDLINE was fully mediated by Google News, and differed from the unadjusted model. The researchers found significant public reactions to the Chikungunya outbreak. They concluded that health authorities could be made aware immediately of such phenomenon with the aid of new technologies for collecting public concerns, disseminating awareness and avoiding misleading information [27].",

Notwithstanding current challenges with the widespread adoption of AI particularly in resource-limited settings, the use of AI in providing in-depth knowledge on individuals\u2019 health, predicting population health risks and improving pandemic preparedness capabilities is likely to increase substantially in the near future [34]. Further, the rapidly expanding mobile phone penetrance, developments in cloud computing, substantial investments in health informatics, electronic medical records (EMRs) and mobile health (mHealth) applications, even in resource-constrained settings, holds significant promise for increasing use and scalability of AI applications in improving public health outcomes [35]. Public health policy, practice and research will continue to benefit from the expanding framework of infodemiology and infoveillance in analyzing health information search, communication and publication behavior on the internet [23, 24]. Advances in cryptographic technologies\u2014including block chain is likely to allay fears and concerns with security, privacy and confidentiality of public digital data/information [36].",

From prevention and health promotion to diagnosis and treatment, AI is increasingly being deployed to improve clinical decision-making, enhance personalized care and public health outcomes. In particular, AI offers enormous potential for cost-savings on therapeutic care given its predictive accuracy of potential outbreaks and epidemics and ability to enhance positive health seeking behaviors (at individual and population levels) during epidemics predicated upon robust infodemiology and infoveillance frameworks supported by expert systems, machine learning algorithms and mobile applications. Amazing as the future of AI in healthcare seems, there are significant legal and ethical concerns that need to be addressed in order to pave way for robust implementation and scalability across a variety of socio-cultural, epidemiological, health system and political contexts.",
