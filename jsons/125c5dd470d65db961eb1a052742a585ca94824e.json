Semi-structured in-depth interviews with leading UK-based OE researchers, and a survey of UK-based OE researchers were conducted. Seven leading researchers were interviewed, and there were 54 survey respondents. Key reported challenges for OE were diminishing resources during recent decades, influenced by social, economic and political drivers, and changing fashions in research policy. Consequently, the community is getting smaller and less influential. These challenges may have negatively affected OE research, causing it to fail to keep pace with recent methodological development and impacting its output of high-quality research. Better communication with, and support from other researchers and relevant policy and funding stakeholders was identified as the main facilitators to OE research. Many diseases were initially discovered in workplaces, as these make exceptionally good study populations to accurately assess exposures. Due to the decline of manufacturing industry, there is a perception that occupational diseases are now a thing of the past. Nevertheless, new occupational exposures remain under-evaluated and the UK has become reliant on overseas epidemiology. This has been exacerbated by the decline in the academic occupational medicine base. Maintaining UK-based OE research is hence necessary for the future development of occupational health services and policies for the UK workforce.",

The challenges included 17 statements on data/participant access and availability, study design, funding and publication. The facilitators included nine statements on support and interest of relevant stakeholders, appropriate study planning and design, and effective communication. The questionnaire also included nine open-ended questions in relation to the participants' perspectives of the impacts J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the challenges and strategies employed to overcome such challenges, and six demographic questions that kept identity concealed.",

The number of researchers in this field is small, but it was difficult to estimate accurately the exact number. The Faculty of Occupational Medicine (2011) estimated that there were an approximately 27 full-time equivalent academic posts in occupational medicine, not all of whom were active in epidemiological research. This number, however, did not include other academics such as statisticians, exposure scientists and non-medical epidemiologists. In the absence of a suitable sampling frame covering the whole community, a convenience sample was chosen (Etikan, 2016) . Potential participants were handed the questionnaires at the International Conference on Epidemiology in Occupational Health conference (EPICOH, Oxford, September 2011) . EPICOH is the largest international conference on OE and was held in the UK at the time of this phase of the study. This provided an ideal opportunity to approach a substantial percentage of the UK-based OE researchers. The conference delegate list included 86 UK delegates, all of whom would have an interest in OE. Another 61 potential participants were identified by screening websites of relevant universities' departments, governmental bodies and other institutions (identified from the conference delegate list and online search) and by snowball sampling (i.e. by asking participants to identify other potential participants). Participants were chosen based on their profiles and/or published work. The aim was to include all researchers in the field of OE. Criteria for inclusion dictated that each participant was an active researcher in the field of OE. No restrictions were applied on the type of work or roles of these researchers; hence, various professionals within OE were included, such as statisticians, epidemiologists, and healthcare professionals (e.g. occupational physicians and nurses). Based on the above extensive search, it is likely that there were less than 200 OE researchers in the UK at that time.",

Some participants believed that, despite the lack of cutting-edge methods, their research was still worth funding and addressed important questions. They, however, acknowledged that using such newer methods would have improved their chances of getting funding: Another reason mentioned for lack of interest in this field was that the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), a key government funding organisation for health research, primarily funds research directed towards the benefit of patients in the NHS. However, in most of OE, the target populations are typically healthy workers or employees (e.g. NHS workforce, factory workers) and not patients: '...the NIHR has few funding opportunities for OH [including OE] , and that it is pretty much for patient benefits. They do not see staff as patients, whereas the NHS staff are our patients, but the NIHR won't fund these studies.' (P7).",

It has become difficult to attract new researchers to this area and leading researchers were reported to be approaching retirement. There is a real concern about the sustainability of the OH workforce and academic base in the UK (Faculty of Occupational Medicine, 2011; Harrison, 2012; Lalloo et al., 2019a; Society of Occupational Medicine, 2017) . One potential reason for the diminishing workforce in OE and its academic base is the exclusion of OHS from the NHS since its inception (Long, 2011) . Thus, the negative impact of this separation of OHS from the NHS on both OH and OE is inevitable in terms of their diminishing academic bases, training, and research (Blain, 1988; Harrison, 2012) . Unsurprisingly, the OE infrastructure might have become insufficient to keep pace with methodological development and maintain the highest academic standards and research quality (Lalloo et al., 2019a) . These issues may not only limit the resources available for this research field, but also restrict the control that OE (and OH) researchers have over the research agenda, as fewer and less influential representatives are available for and involved in funding decisions and policy making. If measures are not taken to address the challenges and increase the opportunities in OE field, the decline in occupational epidemiological knowledge base will continue (Ward et al., 2010) and UK health and safety policy-making will become increasingly reliant on non-UK studies (Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, 2011). Relying on non-UK epidemiological studies or studies from the past is problematic, because exposure data from such studies may not reflect the level of exposure experienced in a UK workplace (Rushton, 2017; Rushton et al., 2012) . The difference in exposure between countries and over time may arise due to differences in regulations, technology, social class, culture, geography, and methods of exposure measurement (Cherrie et al., 2007) .",

As a result of past and ongoing improvement of workplace conditions and establishment of exposure standards, there is a perception that, other than psychosocial and musculoskeletal problems, OH-related diseases are now a thing of the past, mainly because control of exposures is probably seen as the endpoint of the disease prevention effort (Chen and Osman, 2012) . Another factor likely to be contributing to this lack of interest is the decline in heavy industry in the UK. The transformation of the nature of employment and the labour market during recent decades has resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of workers employed in hazardous industries (e.g. mining, rubber) relative to the numbers employed in service industries (e.g. banking, retail) (Floud et al., 2014, pp. 7-8) . For instance, the number employed in the coal industry in the UK declined from 300,000 in the early 1970s to only 1,000 in 2017 (Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2018) , and employment in manufacturing industries declined from 8,909,000 in 1964 to 2,515,000 in 2010 (Griffiths and Wall, 2011 ).",

Similarly, other international organisations have concluded that, although there have been multidisciplinary efforts to develop cancer research methods, these have not been broadly utilised to solve important issues within the occupational cancer field and have therefore recommended the development of innovative methods and tools (Hohenadel et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2003) . In light of the challenges and the developments in methodological approaches in other health disciplines (Spitz et al., 2014; Ward et al., 2003) , it is becoming more challenging for OE to compete for funding and attract younger researchers. The likely main reasons for this lack of innovation are an ageing workforce and fewer researchers entering this field with sufficient expertise in new technologies and techniques (e.g. molecular and genetic techniques, and psychosocial, musculoskeletal and health economic approaches). The study respondents hence recommended a better collaborative approach with other disciplines to facilitate the inclusion of new expertise and innovative methodologies.",

The current ethical and research governance framework in the UK are designed for high-risk studies that use medical interventions primarily on patient populations. These regulations are still imposed on OE studies at a similar level despite the fact that these are primarily observational in nature and are generally low-risk studies in terms of potential harm to participants (Cardillo et al., 2018; Leeson and Tyrer, 2013; Petrova and Barclay, 2019; Ward et al., 2004) . The Health Research Authority introduced the Proportionate Review Service (PRS), under which research studies which raise no material ethical issues will be reviewed by sub-committee rather than at a full meeting of a REC with an aim to make a decision within 14 days of the research proposal application (Health Research Authority, 2020) . The eligible studies for PRS are primarily those that use anonymised data, utilised no linkage to patients' identifiable data and those that use questionnaires or interviews that are not sensitive in nature. These key criteria are generally not applicable to most epidemiological studies, resulting in the same ethics processes being applied to OE studies as to randomised controlled trials of medical interventions.",

Another approach to get a better representation of a wider group of OE researchers would have been through contacting potential participants via the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, which has a medical practitioner membership, and the Society of Occupational Medicine, which includes both medical and non-medical professionals' members. However, not all members of these two bodies are research active and not all active researchers are members of these bodies, hence it is unclear as to whether these sources would have provided a better sampling frame. Nonetheless, this issue could have been explained in the questionnaire cover letter.

In order to justify strongly for increased public and other sources of funding for OE and OH research, and then use the scarce research resources efficiently and effectively, there should also be clear decisions about research priorities. These priorities must be consistent not only with informed scientific opinion but also with relevant stakeholders' needs and national concerns within the broader policy context. A recent study has already highlighted OH research priorities in the UK (Lalloo et al., 2018) . Such an organised review could persuade policy makers and funding bodies to increase resources to this field. Based on this comprehensive review, resources need to be directed to prepare and train young scientists to pursue research in these priority areas. Funding policies should not only focus on the immediate or measurable economic return from research studies. OE research may not necessarily provide a visible benefit or an immediate economic return; however, it may have long-term public health and economic benefits (Robertson, 2015) .",

This will help to assess objectively the potential trends in the rise and fall of research output and to identify gaps and the reasons for these.

The OE field has been influenced by the rise and fall of OH in the UK, which, in turn, has been influenced by social, economic and political factors such as the deindustrialisation, the exclusion of OH from the NHS, and funding policies. This may have contributed to the relative obscurity of OH, and hence OE, when the agendas of both the government and funding bodies are developed, adversely affecting the development of OE. Consequently, OH and safety policies may increasingly have to rely on non-UK studies, which may not sufficiently address UK workforce health issues. Maintaining UK-based OE research is hence necessary for the future development of appropriate occupational health services and policies for the UK workforce. (45) 17.

Similarly, the Society of Occupational Medicine has experienced a steady attrition in its membership due to the ageing population of the wider OH professionals and the lack of new entrants (Society of Occupational Medicine, 2017).",

'There was the media in newspapers and television; there was quite an interest in occupational cancer in 1970s. I think, prior to that, industry hadn't taken much notice. You had heavy industries, with very heavy exposures, and then things came to light as to whether really there was more occupational cancer than people thought. Industry then had to take notice.' (P4) Availability and completeness of workers' or employees' records The availability and completeness of records of the targeted workers or employees were thought to be important in facilitating certain OE studies: 'The crucial issue: what is the quality of the work history records in the factory records? In my opinion, there is no point in going back to individuals asking them to reconstruct their work history, because you will be introducing bias, people will not recall it in the same way. You want the contemporaneous record of what the company would've hopefully kept in a sort of similar way for all or most employees. \u2026it's the quality of the work histories which will then decide how sophisticated the analysis can be, in terms of whether you can estimate chemical exposures to different things etc.'(P4).",
