[6] [7] [8] [9] However, the clinical utility of identifying the specific infectious agent in children with bronchiolitis remains unclear. 10, 11 The 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) bronchiolitis clinical practice guideline 12 states that knowing the infectious agent in a child with bronchiolitis in the acute setting rarely changes management decisions, except for the purposes of cohorting. However, over the past few years there has been a growing literature that bronchiolitis due to certain viruses, specifically rhinovirus (RV), may impact long-term outcomes. [13] [14] [15] [16] To our knowledge, this study is the first prospective, multicenter emergency department (ED)-based sample with short-term follow-up investigating common viruses causing bronchiolitis. The virology samples were collected as complementary data at a subset of sites participating in a larger observational bronchiolitis study. 17 epidemiology of the viruses causing bronchiolitis in the ED setting and determine whether there are distinguishing clinical characteristics or different shortterm outcomes among young children associated with these bronchiolitis pathogens. We hypothesized that children with RV bronchiolitis would have a more frequent history of wheezing when compared to children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis.",

RV has historically been considered an upper respiratory virus, 31 but RV has been reported to infect the lower airways 5, 14 and causes bronchiolitis. 5 Results from single-center studies of hospitalized infants [32] [33] [34] are similar to our multicenter ED data and suggest a different clinical profile for children with RV bronchiolitis. When compared to infants with RSV bronchiolitis, infants with RV bronchiolitis are older and present for medical care earlier in the course of infection. [32] [33] [34] [35] Some data have demonstrated an association between infection with RV and infants with atopic dermatitis, 32,34 but our data did not demonstrate this association. Unlike results observed from a single-center study of hospitalized children, 34 we found that children with a history of wheezing are more likely to have RV infection compared to RSV infection or other viral infection. Moreover, the other reports have not included race \u2044 ethnicity. Our data suggest that African American infants were significantly more likely to have RV infection. This racial \u2044 ethnic preponderance is similar to that among U.S. children with asthma. 36 It appears that these results are not being driven by one dominant site, because we had a good distribution of the number of samples and viruses among the sites.",

These studies were from a single ED, 37 the outpatient setting, 13, 14 and the inpatient setting. 32, 38, 39 Our data are from 14 EDs across the United States and both confirm and extend previous work suggesting that RV may have a distinct role. Specifically, several recent single-center studies have linked RV infection to asthma exacerbations in children and adults, 40, 41 to infant wheezing, 15, 37 and to infants with recurrent respiratory symptoms and abnormal lung function. 14 Recent evidence also links lower respiratory tract illnesses with RV-related wheezing in infancy to childhood wheezing at age 3 years 13 and to children with asthma at age 6 years. 16, 38 For example, in the Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) birth cohort study of children at high risk of developing asthma conducted in Madison, Wisconsin, the most significant predictor in multivariate analysis of wheezing at age 3 years was a moderate-to-severe RV illness with wheezing during infancy. 13 In addition to the different clinical profile of infants with RV, the medications prescribed to the infants in our cohort suggest a different clinical assessment by physicians. Although the treating physicians in our study could not have been aware of the RV infection, they were significantly more likely to treat these children with corticosteroids, even after controlling for other factors in a multivariate model. It is not clear if the corticosteroids shortened the course of the illness, but our data suggest a shorter duration of illness for children with RV infection. One trial of prednisolone for 3 days versus placebo for children hospitalized with their first or second episode of wheezing due to RV demonstrated reduced relapses during a 2-month period after the hospitalization 34 and reduced recurrent wheezing at 1 year. 42 These data are in contrast to other recent corticosteroid treatment results in children with undefined viral illnesses. [43] [44] [45] The children who develop wheezing due to RV seem to have a high likelihood of developing asthma and, therefore, may merit further investigation for clarifying the pathogenesis of asthma and possibly as a target population for the primary prevention of asthma.",

Another potential limitation of this study is that some of the historical items (specifically wheezing and eczema) may not be accurate, because they were determined via parent interview, as opposed to evaluation by health professionals. There is, however, a similar potential for inaccurate reporting from study participants, and the differences between the children infected with RV compared to the other viruses are quite clear and often statistically significant.
