            "text": "In addition to the high incidence of harm from medically supervised use of prescribed drugs, the incidence of unintentional serious harm and death from self-administered overdose of medical drugs, obtained by prescription or illicitly, has increased markedly. The increase has been particularly pronounced in relation to death from opioid analgesics prescribed for pain relief. In the United States, for example, the rate of death, usually from respiratory depression, attributable to prescribed opioid overdose more than doubled in the decade after 2000 (Bohnert et al., 2011, Paulozzi et al., 2012a) and currently exceeds fatal overdose from illicit use of heroin and cocaine combined (Paulozzi et al., 2012a, Paulozzi et al., 2012b). As discussed in Chapter 14, sufficient access to pain management involving opioid analgesics is more the exception than the rule worldwide, especially in developing countries (Seya et al., 2011). In contrast, there is a consensus that opioid analgesics are markedly over-prescribed in the United States, an opinion confirmed by the incidence of fatal opioid overdosing in that country.",

Patients, it seems, have come to expect greater compliance from doctors, who in turn are less inclined to refuse patients\u2019 requests. Change in medical culture appears to have been abetted by legal mandate in certain circumstances requiring compliance with patients\u2019 requests for pain relief. In addition, the convenience of prescribing drugs, and profit from their sale, tend to put patients\u2019 requests for pain relief ahead of other considerations, including patients\u2019 own ultimate welfare. This is especially evident when drugs such as opioids are prescribed for patients known or suspected of being addicted. Prescribing in those instances is self-evidently not effective as intervention for drug addiction, whereas more appropriate intervention (e.g., education and counseling) is time consuming. According to Lembke (2012, p. 1580):for physicians, treating pain pays, whereas treating addiction does not.\n",

Many countries have what are known as spontaneous reporting systems, which are usually administered by a central or regional regulatory authority, and in some countries reporting is mandatory. Reports of harm from prescribed drugs are received from medical doctors and other health professionals, including pharmacists and nurses. The main function of such systems is to provide a repository of information about the frequency, range, and severity of harm in order to gauge the safety of prescribed drugs currently being used in clinical practice. Such systems are intended to provide a more detailed, representative, and longer-term depiction of drug effects than studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies during premarketing clinical trials of new drugs and postmarketing surveillance once drugs become available for use in clinical practice. Consequently, the quality of the information stored in such repositories is important for public safety, and underreporting poses serious potential threats.",

The studies had used various methods for estimating reporting levels, including comparing spontaneous reports with data from alternative sources that allowed more comprehensive scrutiny\u2014such as hospital admission data, discharge notes, and insurance claims databases. The findings from the 37 studies indicated widespread underreporting. The underreporting rate was estimated for different settings (hospitals and general practice) and for different drugs, and the rates of underreporting were found to be high in all areas of clinical practice. Specifically, the median rate of underreporting was a remarkable 94%.",

It is possible, however, that a single overall rate gives a distorted account of the situation due to a likely bias against reporting common, less serious instances of harm, which comprise the majority in most settings. There was some confirmation of that suspicion in the Hazell and Shakir (2006) study. The median underreporting rate for \u201cserious/severe\u201d harm was indeed found to be lower (i.e., more such events were reported) than the overall rate. However, the difference between the two rates was not great, wherein the median underreporting rate for serious harm was 85%. That is, despite a degree of selective reporting related to severity of events, underreporting remains staggeringly high even for serious harm \u201cincluding suspected reactions with fatal outcome\u201d (Hazell and Shakir, 2006, p. 391).",

In an attempt to increase reporting levels, many countries have extended existing systems to allow patients to report instances of harm they have sustained. One such system is the Yellow Card Scheme in the United Kingdom (Fortnum et al., 2012). When introduced in 1964 following the thalidomide tragedy, the scheme was initially available only to doctors, dentists, and coroners, but was later extended to include pharmacists, nurses, and midwives.",

It follows that\u2014at 18% of all reports in the scheme\u2014notifications from the public represent a small fraction of the total number of adverse events that actually occur. That inference was confirmed by survey results reported by Fortnum et al. (2012) involving a representative sample of more than 2000 of the general population in the United Kingdom. Although about one-quarter of respondents reported having experienced a side effect of medicine, less than 10% had heard of the Yellow Card Scheme and just three people in the entire sample of 2000 had ever used it.

The last of these includes performing the intervention on the wrong side of anatomically symmetrical structures (e.g., the left side of the body instead of the right), at the wrong location or body part (e.g., the wrong finger or wrong level on the spine), and wrong location within a structure (e.g., anterior versus posterior). When surveyed, one-in-five hand surgeons reported that they have performed wrong-site surgery (typically wrong-finger surgery) (Meinberg and Stern, 2003) and one-in-two neurosurgeons reported having performed wrong-level lumbar surgery (Mody et al., 2008).",

            "text": "An Austro-Hungarian doctor, Ignas Semmelweis, working in Vienna in the 1840s, is credited with having made the initial breakthrough discoveries showing that doctors could be the vectors of appalling death and disease due to puerperal fever in maternity hospitals (see Box 6.1\nand Figure 6.4\n). Puerperal fever, also known as childbed fever and the doctors\u2019 plague, is a bacterial infection contracted by women during childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion, especially when these occur in unhygienic surroundings. The term has since been replaced by more specific terminology that identifies the site and severity of infection. Broadly, pathogenic organisms that invade the bloodstream and lymph system may cause potentially fatal septicemia (blood poisoning). When Semmelweis first drew attention to the possibility, there was resistance among physicians to the suggestion that they themselves were a common cause of patient death. However, bacteriological discoveries later in the nineteenth century, including those of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, led to acceptance of the germ theory of disease over the previously popular miasma theory. Confirmation of the germ theory provided convincing evidence that healthcare personnel, practices, and procedures can be a potent cause of disease.Box 6.1The Father of Infection Control\n\nDuring the early period of the medicalization of childbirth, puerperal fever was a major cause of death for mothers and newborns. As discussed in the text, physicians were the main cause of what was also known as childbed fever and the doctors\u2019 plague, a highly contagious bacterial infection that can rapidly develop into fatal septicemia (blood poisoning). In the absence of sterile procedures, placental separation during childbirth creates conditions that are highly susceptible to infection, and epidemics of puerperal fever accompanied the expansion of hospitals due to the rich infective environment harbored therein.Chance circumstances at the University of Vienna General Hospital in the mid-nineteenth century provided near-perfect conditions for a controlled experiment, which revealed that insanitary practice by physicians was a leading cause of death from puerperal fever. Admissions to the obstetrics department, which at that time was Europe\u2019s largest, were more-or-less randomly allocated to either of two wards. The wards were identical in almost all respects, including physical facilities, ventilation and temperature control, bed density, patient diet, hygiene of the bed linen, and demographic characteristics of the women. Until 1841, the two wards were staffed by a combination of physicians and midwives, but a change in policy brought a change in staffing arrangements. One ward came to be staffed by physicians and medical students, and the other staffed by midwives and midwifery students (Figure 6.4).After graduating from medical school at the University of Vienna, Semmelweis trained as an obstetrician at the Vienna General Hospital. While there, he observed that the mortality rate for puerperal fever was substantially higher in the ward staffed by physicians than in the ward staffed by midwives. He surmised that the difference in mortality rate was probably related to the different duties performed by the two groups. He noted, in particular, that the physicians and their students routinely performed autopsy dissections, whereas the midwives did not. Semmelweis hypothesized that puerperal fever was caused by the \u201cconveyance of decomposed animal-organic matter\u201d carried on the hands of physicians and transferred to expectant mothers at the time of childbirth. Crucially, he devised an intervention to test his hypothesis. Beginning in 1847, physicians and medical students were required to wash their hands in a solution of bleach prior to assisting with deliveries. Mortality due to puerperal fever in that ward immediately fell to a level approximating that of the ward staffed by midwives.\nFigure 6.4 shows that during the period before 1841, when both wards were staffed by a combination of physicians and midwives, the average rate of mortality due to puerperal fever was similar for the two wards. From 1841 to 1846, the mortality rate increased sharply for the ward staffed by physicians and fell for the ward staffed by midwives. The role of physicians in transmitting disease, concealed when both wards were staffed by physicians and midwives, was revealed. That role was confirmed when the new hand-washing regimen mandated by Semmelweis was introduced and the mortality rate in the ward staffed by physicians fell to a level approximating that of the ward staffed by midwives.Great MindsSemmelweis was not the first to observe that puerperal fever is caused by physical contact between mothers in childbirth and those who attended the births. In 1843, the American physician, poet, and novelist, Oliver Wendell Holmes, published an essay in which he argued that physicians were transmitting the disease between successive patients they visited (Holmes, 1843). He declared that \u201cdoctors were instruments of death\u201d by failing to thoroughly clean themselves, their clothing, and their instruments after attending a patient who had the disease and before going onto the next mother-to-be. He even presaged Semmelweis\u2019 specific findings with the observation: \u201cA physician holding himself in readiness to attend cases of midwifery, should never take any active part in the post-mortem examination of cases of puerperal fever.\u201dEarlier still, about a half-century before Semmelweis conducted his work, a Scottish physician, Alexander Gordon, asserted that puerperal fever \u201cseized such women, only as were visited, or delivered, by a practitioner, or taken care of by a nurse, who had previously attended patients affected with the disease\u201d (Gordon, 1795). In repudiation of the then popular miasma theory of disease, Gordon also argued that puerperal fever is not due \u201cto a noxious constitution of the atmosphere.\u201d Given that Holmes knew of Gordon\u2019s work and acknowledged its importance (Lowis, 1993), it is possible that Semmelweis was familiar with both.Without entering into the longstanding debate over who deserves most credit for discovering the link between insanitary practices and puerperal fever, it is worth mentioning that Semmelweis is distinguished among early pioneers of healthcare-acquired infection by being the first to provide systematic data confirming the efficacy of hand hygiene in limiting the spread of infectious disease. What unites Semmelweis, Holmes, and Gordon is their shared perspicacity and tenacity. They are all likewise united, as are many bearers of uncomfortable ideas before and since, by how they were ignored and sometimes berated by professional colleagues for the views they espoused and the forcefulness with which they argued them. In his day, Semmelweis suffered many rebukes, but today he is applauded as the Father of Infection Control (Best and Neuhauser, 2004).",

In 2005, the WHO launched a global campaign to reduce HAI and identified the promotion of hand hygiene as a priority (Pittet et al., 2009). The WHO guidelines provide healthcare personnel, hospital administrators, and health authorities with specific recommendations for improving practices to reduce the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in healthcare settings (WHO, 2009).

The explanation for this shift in attention is that resistance is developing faster in Gram-negative than in Gram-positive bacteria, and fewer antibiotics are either available or in development to provide therapeutic cover against Gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria have not only been responsible for devastating hospital- and community-acquired disease, but their rapid spread has been aided by human travel and migration (Schofield, 2011). One particular form of international travel that has been identified as having markedly enhanced potential to accelerate the rate of bacterial transmission worldwide is medical tourism, sometimes called added value travel. This involves people traveling between countries in pursuit of lower-cost medical procedures, often for elective surgery, such as cosmetic procedures, but increasingly also for corrective surgery. It is claimed that, in India alone, this trade, which is forecast to increase, currently caters for 450,000 people per year as part of an industry worth about USD2 billion (Walsh and Toleman, 2011).",

Bacteria containing this genetic element (or variants) acquire resistance to almost all antimicrobial agents. The ability to transmit among usual Gram-negative bacteria confers enormous potential for the NDM-1 gene pool to go largely undetected. It has been estimated that at least 100 million Indian residents carry NDM-1 bacteria as normal gut flora having the potential to cause vast numbers of cases of largely untreatable infection (Walsh and Toleman, 2011). The first confirmed appearance of NDM-1 was in Sweden in 2008 in a patient who returned home with the infection after being hospitalized in India (Yong et al., 2009) and identification of other similar cases quickly followed. Bacteria containing the gene have since been isolated in many countries covering most regions of the world, raising fears about the \u201cuncontrollable spread of pandemic clones for which new and effective antibiotics are currently not available\u201d (Rolain et al., 2010, p. 1700).",

Indian physician Abdul Ghafur has claimed that \u201cIndia, is the world leader in antibiotic resistance, in no other country [have] antibiotics been misused to such an extent\u201d (Ghafur, 2010, p. 144). High levels of bacterial pollution of the environment and endemic infection in the population have encouraged antibiotic use in India as a substitute for sanitation.

The fact that the quantity of antibiotics that goes to healthy animals exceeds the total amount used to treat disease in humans is universally accepted as gross misuse and a major contributor to the emergence of multidrug resistance. The additional fact that some of the same antibiotics used in medicine are also used in food production further compounds the problem of their overuse in animal husbandry.

This could include transfer to wild animals, birds, and fish, thereby adding to existing threats from emerging infectious diseases in wildlife populations (Daszak et al., 2000). Additionally, there is increased risk of transfer of resistance genes to humans from the consumption of farmed animals. Consequently, not only can resistant animal pathogens cause human disease, but resistance genes transferred from animals to the normal intestinal flora of humans can also cause disease. Thus, the carriage of resistance genes by pathogenic as well \u201cnormal\u201d bacteria greatly increases the threat of infectious diseases being disseminated throughout human populations.

The strategy assumes that in time the new agents will also succumb to the relentless spread of resistance, at which time they must then be replaced by still newer agents. No one has addressed the problem of how many cycles this process might need to be repeated, but in principle it could continue ad infinitum. It seems, however, that this replacement strategy is advocated more often for want of something better to do, rather than genuine belief that it can work.

Additionally, with respect to antibiotics, there is the likelihood of a relatively short period of effectiveness (and profitability) due to loss of efficacy from resistance, and the need for further replacement with the next new drug.

Industry\u2019s emphasis on profitability, not need, is reflected in the global distribution of the research effort dedicated to the development of drugs in general.

The main strategy for achieving that outcome is antibiotic stewardship, which refers to coordinated efforts to improve policies, guidelines, education, regulations, and surveillance for the appropriate use of antibiotics, including optimizing doses and duration of treatment and minimizing inappropriate use (e.g., Bartlett, 2011, Charani et al., 2010, Fishman, 2006). Such proposals, however, bear a striking resemblance to proposals intended to address the problem of healthcare hygiene. Both are examples of the evident inability of biomedicine to respond decisively and effectively to longstanding and incontrovertible evidence of the harm it causes.",

Additionally, compared to patients not isolated, patients who are isolated have been found to be at increased risk of harm, including delays in treatment and increased incidence of adverse events (Zahar et al., 2013). The fact that harm may be more frequent for isolated patients is salient because of the high levels of surveillance and staffing that accompany isolation, with the staffing ratio in the Zahar et al.

F\u00e4tkenheuer et al. (2014) have proffered an interesting argument based on the notion that isolation, such as imprisonment, is the prototypical punishment that society imposes on wrongdoers. As such, it is unsurprising that patients subjected to isolation may experience increased anxiety, depression, and resentment. Indeed, apart from absence of uniformity concerning suitable isolation methods, such as use of gowns, gloves, masks, and isolation rooms, considerable uncertainty exists in hospitals regarding the circumstances that warrant the use of contact isolation.

However, the emergence of resistance was always anticipated. From the earliest clinical use of antibiotics more than 70 years ago, antibiotic resistance was not merely observed but was well-understood and predicted on the basis of principles of Darwinian selection (Davies and Davies, 2010). Therefore, to regard antibiotic resistance as an unintended consequence is to engage in euphemism and prevarication. The likely reoccurrence of antibiotic resistance following the introduction of each new antibiotic has certainly been anticipated. Global population endangerment from the misuse of antibiotics in the absence of strenuous action to at least impede if not stop the evolution of antibiotic resistance, when its occurrence was anticipated all along, is illustrative of the moral hazard intrinsic to biomedical healthcare and commercial husbandry.",

Moreover, to the extent that death and morbidity from largely untreatable infections are common in healthcare settings, it could be said that within the confines of the modern hospital the world has already substantially returned to the pre-antibiotic era. The spread of antibiotic-resistant infections from hospitals to communities could well mark wholesale return to epidemic levels of population infection equivalent to, or even greater than, those that existed before the epidemiologic transition. If so, the epidemics will be due not so much to loss of antibiotic potency but to misuse of antibiotics. In short, the belief that loss of antibiotic efficacy will by itself cause a return to high levels of population infection is false. Rather, the real threat lies in population dissemination of new, untreatable, and largely \u201cunnatural\u201d strains of infectious pathogens.
