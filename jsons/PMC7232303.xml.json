            "text": "Infections with cytopathic viruses typically cause cellular lethality, which explains their acute character, leading either to the death of the organism or clearing of the infection by the immune response. By contrast, non-cytopathic viruses can establish readily long-lasting (persistent) infections that manage the evasion of elimination by the immune system for very long periods [1]. Mechanisms to establish viral persistence not only include modulation of viral gene expression, subversion of apoptosis and immune evasion but can also involve the selection of particular cell types that are ideal for long-term preservation [2]. Although most studies have focused on alterations in the viral genome during establishment of persistent virus infections (and loss of the cytopathic character) in cell lines, e.g., [3,4], evidence exists for the importance of the interaction between the genetic make-up of both host cells and virus [5]. Host and cell tropism are considered very important characteristics of viruses and differences in efficiency of viral infection can be determined at each step of the viral replication cycle [6]. However, because of the importance of cellular entry in viral infection, viral tropism is usually distinguished between receptor-dependent and -independent (i.e., intracellular) mechanisms.",

            "text": "In our previous study, it was observed that, when applied at relatively low MOI (multiplicity of infection), CrPV does not trigger an acute infection in silkworm Bm5 cells and other lepidopteran and coleopteran cell lines [10]. A period of viral persistence was observed during which the host cells maintained a normal growth rate and low levels of CrPV replication were detected. Only 2\u20133 weeks after virus inoculation, cytopathic effects started to emerge, which was accompanied with the transcriptional induction of immune pathway genes [10]. The slow kinetics of CrPV infection in Bm5 cells and the other lepidopteran and coleopteran cell lines [10] stood in strong contrast with the fast infection dynamics observed in Drosophila S2 cells. When inoculated at similar MOI as for Bm5 cells, infection of S2 cells became pathogenic already after 36\u201348 h, which was followed by widespread mortality [10]. Our observations therefore indicate important differences between S2 cells and other (coleopteran and lepidopteran) cell lines that were investigated with respect to the pathogenicity of CrPV infection. While acute infections can be triggered in lepidopteran Hi5 cells, a much higher MOI is needed than for S2 cells and kinetics remains much slower [11]. Injection of CrPV virions in insect species of three different orders (Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera) also did not trigger pathogenic infections [12]. Thus, S2 cells seem to represent a unique case with respect to sensitivity to CrPV infection that stands in stark contrast with infections in other cell lines. From this point of view, the examination of the changes in the metabolome in response to CrPV infection in S2 cells is of particular interest since it would be representative of a cell type that is very sensitive to CrPV infection. The comparison with the persistent condition in Bm5 cells furthermore could reveal important insights regarding the impact of the metabolome on the type of CrPV infection (persistent or acute) that will occur.",

The samples of acute infection of S2 cells were analyzed together with samples of persistent infection of Bm5 cells [13], to allow direct comparison of metabolic changes in the different cell lines. The metabolomics approach revealed striking differences with respect to central carbon metabolism during the course of infection in the two cell lines. While carbohydrates and amino acids increased in abundance during the persistent phase of infection in Bm5 cells, the metabolites became depleted during the early and middle stages of acute infection in S2 cells. At late stages of infection (i.e., 2\u20133 weeks in Bm5 cells, while 24\u201336 h in S2 cells), an opposite pattern was observed (i.e., decrease in Bm5 and increase in S2). Central carbon mechanism is therefore proposed to represent an important intrinsic host factor that affects the outcome of CrPV infection and that can be subject to manipulation by CrPV for optimal replication. Those findings may have implications for the manipulation of viral pathogenesis and the development of persistently infected viral culture systems.",

The persistent mode of infection that is observed in Bm5 cells was also observed in nine lepidopteran and two coleopteran cell lines while acute infection at low MOI was a unique feature of S2 cells [10].

Moreover, different infection stages differed significantly in both Bm5 and S2 cells with respect to metabolite dynamics. Regarding the Bm5-CrPV infection model, it was expected that the metabolic needs for the phases of viral persistence (2 DPI and 1 WPI), the transition to pathogenesis with increased viral replication (2 WPI) and advanced pathogenesis (3 WPI) would be very different from each other [13]. In the first instance, similar stages could be expected during CrPV infection of S2 cells, albeit on a shorter time scale (36 h versus 3 weeks; Figure 1). Considering the distinct metabolic effects at different stages of CrPV infection, it was of interest to examine a common response in the two different cell lines, for example by comparing pathogenic stages (3 WPI) in Bm5 cells with late infection (24\u201336 HPI) in S2 cells, and persistent stages (2 DPI-1 WPI) in Bm5 cells with early infection (6\u201312 HPI) in S2 cells. Surprisingly, only limited similarity was found in the metabolic profile between the two infected cell lines during the course of infection and in relation to uninfected cells. Thus, although it has been reported that viruses belonging to different families could cause some common metabolic responses [23,24], in our study it was observed that CrPV could induce only minimal common metabolic changes in different host cells.",

By contrast, our analysis indicated that such restriction did not exist for CrPV infection of S2 cells and that the decrease in amino acids and carbohydrates during early stages (6 HPI and 12 HPI; Figure 6 and Figure 7) might already reflect the consumption of building blocks for high levels of viral replication and virion reproduction.

Notably, in S2 cells, opposite kinetics in abundances of sugars and amino acids were observed compared to Bm5 cells and the depletion of glucose and glutamine at the late stages was not detected. Both glucose and glutamine are major carbon sources to support energetic and biosynthetic requirements [23] and their depletion was considered an important contributing factor to cell death during pathogenic phases of CrPV infection in Bm5 cells [13].

Of relevance may be the observation that at high cell densities the performance of BEVS is inhibited due to the suppression of central carbon metabolism [26]. Thus, the above results support the idea that CrPV depends on and can alter specific metabolic processes in different host cells and, consequently, that these virally induced alternations of host metabolism can result in different types of viral infection (persistence versus pathogenesis). However, in order to link the host specific metabolic changes to viral pathogenesis, it will be necessary to conduct further studies in different host cells where comparable infection kinetics are observed. For example, although S2 cells are more sensitive than the other cell lines that were investigated, the kinetics of infection in Hi5 cells can be considerably accelerated after application of CrPV at much higher MOI [11]. Thus, comparative metabolomics studies could be extended between pathogenically infected S2 and Hi5 cells as well as among several other persistently infected lepidopteran and coleopteran cell lines.",

Furthermore, polyamine depletion following induction of a catabolic enzyme by type I interferon was demonstrated as an antiviral strategy to restrict CHIKV and ZIKV replication.

Our data revealed important changes in host metabolism during CrPV persistence and pathogenesis and identified several metabolic characteristics during CrPV infection of Bm5 and S2 cells. While amino acids play an important role during CrPV infection, our analysis suggests that their levels were sufficiently high in S2 cells to trigger acute infection. In Bm5 cells, on the other hand, amino acid synthesis may need to be activated, which may explain the period of limited CrPV replication (persistence) that occurs in this cell line. Similarly, significant modulations of the levels of glucose and glutamine, related to energy production, were observed in Bm5 cells but not in S2 cells. In addition, polyamines seem to be critical for CrPV persistence and pathogenesis. Further functional analysis is needed to confirm requirements of specific metabolites for optimal CrPV replication, and additional experiments are required to identify unknown components from the untargeted metabolomics analysis to reveal important host factors during CrPV infection. Finally, integration of the metabolomics approach with other omics approaches [33,34] is necessary to advance our understanding of the process of persistence and pathogenesis in insect cell lines.",
