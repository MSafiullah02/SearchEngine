            "text": "In its entirety, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) involves an intricate network of hundreds of enzymes regulating the major mechanism for degrading damaged or unrequired proteins in eukaryotic cells. More simplistically, it is a process whereby proteins are tagged for \u2018shredding\u2019 by the 26S proteasome. This is a large multi-subunit complex consisting of a 20S proteolytic core and one or two 19S regulatory particles [1]. The tag used for this process is ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid (approximately 8.5 kDa) peptide. These ubiquitin tags can be attached as monomers or as polyubiquitin chains. The attachment is an isopeptide bond formed between the carboxy-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the \u025b-amino group of lysine residue(s) of the substrate protein. Ubiquitin itself contains seven exposed lysine residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48 and Lys63) which, in addition to its N-terminus, provide eight linking options in situations where it forms part of a polyubiquitin chain. The exact connectivity of these linkages provides a more detailed \u2018message on the tag\u2019: Lys11-linked and Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains are most commonly used to flag protein substrates for proteasomal degradation [2].",

            "text": "Unwanted proteins are ubiquitinated via the sequential action of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases [3]. In man, high substrate specificity is achieved through the selective utilisation of one of over 700 E3 ligases for the final ubiquitin transfer step [4]. This tagging process is kept in balance by a class of proteases which remove ubiquitin from proteins. These are the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). DUB-mediated removal of ubiquitin saves tagged proteins from being degraded, but DUBs are also involved in more subtle editing of the polyubiquitin signal [5], and are necessary to cleave ubiquitin precursors and to recycle ubiquitin monomers [6].",

Because of its central role in regulating homeostasis, it is involved in many aspects of cellular proliferation and survival. Finding compounds which modulate the UPS has therefore become an active area of research for pharmaceutical companies. It became a validated therapeutic pathway with the approval of the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (1) and carfilzomib (2) (in 2003 and 2012, respectively) for the treatment of haematological malignancies (Figure 1\n) [1]. These compounds preferentially inhibit the chymotrypsin-like proteolytic sites of the 20S core. Since the approval of bortezomib, there has been much effort on targeting the protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes upstream of the proteasome in the search for new cancer treatments. The most clinically advanced compound to emerge so far is MLN4924 (3) which is an inhibitor of Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 subunit 1. Nedd8 is a ubiquitin-like protein. MLN4924 is currently in Phase I clinical trials for treating haematological malignancies and solid tumours [9]. In addition to cancer [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], the utility of DUB and E1/E2/E3 inhibitors is being researched across other therapeutic areas including neurodegeneration, haematology and infectious disease [17], [18], [19], [20].",

The theme of this perspective was to predict whether, as happened within the kinase family, the UPS would ever become a major source of drug targets. To help inform this evolving story, in this chapter we review representative small-molecule inhibitors of a range of DUBs covering the last decade. The focus is on human DUBs, although viral DUBs are also discussed in order to illustrate specific points. General trends which emerge from this analysis are discussed in Section 5. Note the DUB inhibitor patent landscape has also been the subject of a recent review [21].",

            "text": "Ubiquitin-mediated activation of the catalytic mechanism has been elucidated for several other DUBs, and is especially clear in the case of one of the smallest family members UCHL1 (24.8 kDa). The X-ray structure of apo UCHL1 was first solved by Das et al. in 2006 [28]. The active site was found to resemble that of a typical cysteine protease such as papain [29], except that His161 is 7.7 \u00c5 away from the catalytic cysteine (Cys90) resulting in a structure that looks incapable of being catalytically active (PDB: 2ETL). In this paper, the team speculated that a substrate-induced rearrangement would be required in order to activate this protease. Four years later, the same team solved the X-ray structure of UCHL1 bound to ubiquitin VME [30]. This structure revealed that an amino-terminal \u03b2-hairpin of ubiquitin pushes into a distal site of UCHL1. This triggers a domino effect, via two phenylalanine side chains, which results in His161 being pushed within 4 \u00c5 of Cys90 and thereby activating UCHL1 to react with the VME warhead. Figure 6\nshows the resultant structure (PDB: 4KW5) in the same orientation as Figure 5, with ubiquitin (orange (grey in the print version)) and UCHL1 (purple (dark grey in the print version)). The \u03b2-hairpin of ubiquitin is highlighted, as is the important \u2018substrate-filtering\u2019 crossover loop of UCHL1 which is a characteristic of the entire UCH family [31].",

Ubl domains are very common within the USP family [36], [37]. They are stretches of 45\u201380 amino acids which share the \u03b2-grasp fold of ubiquitin, and can be located either N-terminally, within or C-terminally to the CD. Structural information on how Ubls and additional domains of DUBs interact continues to emerge [38]. This is demonstrated by recent publications on the first characterisation of USP11 domain architecture and the discovery of a new binding site on USP7 (via the second of its five Ubls) [39], [40]. The presence of additional domains, as well as cofactors for a few USPs [41], [42], in theory provides multiple allosteric options for DUB inhibition. It also results in DUB family members varying greatly in domain architecture and size (ranging from 188 to > 2000 amino acids).

Fluorescence polarisation detection could then be utilised to test whether compounds were capable of blocking the DUB-mediated cleavage of Ub-AMC to AMC. Although simple, this relatively old technology is prone to picking up fluorescent artefacts [43]. More importantly, Ub-AMC does a poor job of mimicking the natural DUB substrates, since the flat bicyclic AMC group is very different from the narrow side chain of a lysine. Alternative tags which are less prone to fluorescent artefacts were subsequently incorporated (rhodamine/Rho 110 and tetramethylrhodamine/TAMRA), but the resultant Ub-Rho and Ub-TAMRA substrates are no closer to genuine DUB substrates than Ub-AMC.",

Both are highly pathogenic with the potential for human to human transmission [54]. Both contain papain-like cysteine proteases termed SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro, respectively. In addition to processing viral polyprotein, these proteases function as DUBs (and also as deISGylating enzymes) removing ubiquitin and ISG15 (another ubiquitin-like peptide) from host cell proteins, resulting in antagonism of the host antiviral immune response [55]. Hence, both SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro have been proposed as important antiviral targets.",

Compound optimisation resulted in GRL0617 (6) which has an IC50 of 0.6 \u03bcM against SARS-CoV PLpro and has an EC50 of 15 \u03bcM in an antiviral cell-based assay (Figure 9\n). An X-ray structure of 6 in SARS-CoV PLpro showed that it binds within the S4 and S3 subsites of the protease (PDB: 3E9S). These equate to the regions in which the side chains of Lys73-Arg74 of ubiquitin bind. Over 6 years, the same team reported in a series of publications [54], [61], [62], [63] compounds from related series such as 7 which retain the naphthyl group and bind to the same S4/S3 subsites of SARS-CoV PLpro (PDB: 3MJ5). Their most recent publication shows how a further twofold potency improvement was achieved by changing the benzodioxolane for a 3-fluoro phenyl to give compound 8 (IC50 0.15 \u03bcM, antiviral EC50 5.4 \u03bcM) [54].",

High-throughput screening of some nine and a half thousand bioactive compounds with the USP1/UAF1 complex using a Ub-Rho substrate by the Zhuang group identified several low \u03bcM hits [68]. The most potent was the antipsychotic drug pimozide (11) (Figure 12\n). Further screening revealed pimozide to be more than 50-fold selective over other USPs, including USP46/UAF1 which shares the same cofactor. The compound was found to be \u2018largely reversible\u2019, not binding at the active site and not acting via USP1/UAF1 complex disruption. However, no further optimisation of this hit has been described. More recent DUB panel profiling of pimozide using the diubiquitin/MALDI-TOF MS technique suggests that the compound is less selective than previously thought, inhibiting many other DUBs with a similar affinity to USP1 [50].",

However, this quinone-containing compound was found to have negligible selectivity over USP5 and UCHL3. Diubiquitin/MALDI-TOF MS DUB profiling also showed that a close analogue of C527 (SJB3-019A 15) inhibited approximately half of all DUBs screened at 3 \u03bcM. It is likely that 14 and 15 are redox cycling compounds (RCCs) which inhibit USP1 and other DUBs through oxidation of the catalytic cysteine. This has been reported for several structural motifs including quinones, and is especially pronounced in the presence of DTT [74]. This is not an attractive mechanism for protease inhibition since RCCs have promiscuous activity. The Brik group has also uncovered similar quinone-containing RCCs in their screens against USP2. In this case, they were able to confirm oxidation as the mechanism of protease inhibition through MS analysis of USP2 pre- and post-treatment with the compounds. An increase in molecular weight by 32 Da confirmed an oxidation, presumably of the catalytic cysteine side chain from the thiol RSH to the sulfinic acid RSO2H [75].",

The compound was shown to be reversible and not to compete with iodoacetamide, a thiol-alkylating agent, indicating that HBX41108 does not protect the active site cysteine. In 2010, a paper by the same group showed that HBX41108 was more potent against USP8 (96 nM) [83]. This paper also showed that the electron-deficient 2,3-dicyano-pyrazine ring of HBX41108 is highly electrophilic, since dimethylamine displaces the nitrile group para to the ketone at room temperature. However, nitrile displacement is unlikely to be involved in the compound's binding to USP7, since this would be expected to be an irreversible step, inconsistent with the findings of the initial Hybrigenics paper. Nonetheless, this reactivity could explain why HBX41108 was found by diubiquitin/MALDI-TOF MS DUB profiling to significantly inhibit half the DUBs tested at 1 \u03bcM, and all DUBs except the JAMMs at 5 \u03bcM [50]. Also in 2010, a Hybrigenics patent was published claiming compounds such as 19 as low \u03bcM inhibitors of USP7 [84].

Subsequent optimisation led to compound 22, which as well as being more potent for USP7 and USP47, is significantly less reactive with glutathione and more stable in plasma [86]. Both of these factors are important for reducing clearance. Although some toxicophores remain in 22\n[64], at least the nitro group was found to be non-essential.

By screening a natural product library of marine invertebrate extracts against USP7/Ub-Rho, researchers at Progenra found that the pyrrole alkaloid spongiacidin C (23) is an inhibitor with an IC50 of 3.8 \u03bcM [90]. No binding mechanism is proposed, but 23 does exhibit some selectivity over the small panel tested (USP21CD 16.6 \u03bcM, USP2CD and USP8CD > 30 \u03bcM). HBX19818 (24) was discovered by Hybrigenics from a high-throughput USP7/Ub-AMC screen [91], [92]. This 4-chloro-pyridine is a weak USP7 inhibitor (28 \u03bcM) which binds irreversibly by nucleophilic aromatic substitution onto the electron-deficient heterocycle with consequent loss of the chlorine. MS/trypsin digest studies confirmed this mechanism and interestingly showed that 24 reacted almost entirely with the active site cysteine (Cys223) in preference to other solvent-exposed cysteine residues. This shows that 24 is not an indiscriminate arylating agent and is consistent with the selectivity of the compound (negligible activity at 100 \u03bcM against USP2/5/8/20, UCHL1, UCHL3 and SENP1). In a more recent Hybrigenics patent, a series of 4-hydroxy piperidines are described as weak non-covalent USP7 inhibitors [93].

A fragment set of 2000 compounds was screened at 200 \u03bcM using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as the detection technique. This gave 34 primary hits which were validated with an orthogonal protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study. One of these hits (ADC-01) was relatively potent (K\nd\n = 2.2 \u03bcM by SPR and IC50\n = 12 \u03bcM in a USP7 biochemical assay). This compound was optimised with the assistance of ligand\u2013enzyme complex X-ray structures to a much more potent example ADC-03 (45 nM). Although no structures were shown, ADC-03 was described as being non-covalent, extremely selective (IC50\n > 100 \u03bcM against 38 other DUBs, including the closely related DUB USP47 which the Progenra compounds do not discriminate over), clean in redox/aggregation assays and very stable to both human plasma and glutathione (T\n1/2\n > 6 h). The compound works in a whole-cell HCT116 activity probe assay at around 1 \u03bcM, is non-genotoxic and demonstrates p53 stabilisation. No microsomal, hepatocyte or in vivo data were included.",

However, the compound was discovered not to be a direct Jak2 inhibitor, but instead an inhibitor of DUB(s) capable of modulating Jak2 ubiquitination, trafficking and signal transduction [102]. The same group showed, using an activity probe cell-based assay, that WP1130 inhibits USP5, USP9x and the 19S regulatory particle-associated cysteine DUBs USP14 and UCHL5 (UCH37) with an IC50 of between 5 and 10 \u03bcM [103], [104]. It also inhibits USP5 and USP9x (as well as UCHL1) in isolated DUB assays using Ub-AMC (> 80% inhibition at 5 \u03bcM). The Donato group used WP1130 (30 mg/kg, oral daily to infected mice) to demonstrate that it has anti-murine norovirus (MNV) activity [105]. They attributed this to the compound's USP14 activity since this DUB is required for optimal norovirus infection. Another group showed that WP1130 depleted E-twenty-six-related gene (ERG) and retarded prostate tumour growth, this time through its USP9x inhibitory activity, by administering it by i.p. injection (40 mg/kg) on alternate days to xenografted mice [106].",

Using UV absorbance of WP1130, the group demonstrated that the compound bound preferentially to the cysteine residues located within the zinc-finger structural element. When WP1130 was analysed by the diubiquitin/MALDI-TOF MS technique, it was found to inhibit USP9x only modestly at 1 \u03bcM. It inhibited more than 10 other DUBs more strongly [50]. Although discrepant from earlier claims of WP1130 being \u2018partially selective\u2019, this wider profiling result would tie in with the fact that approximately half of all DUB's CDs are predicted to have a zinc finger [107].",

In mechanistic investigations, they found that 37 did not inhibit the proteolytic activity of the proteasome or cause disassociation. Activity probe assays with either the whole 26S proteasome or the 19S regulatory particle showed that the compound blocked the reaction of both USP14 and UCHL5 with haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin vinyl methyl sulfone (VMS). By using purified 19S in a Ub-AMC assay, 37 was shown to have an IC50 of 2.1 \u03bcM (6.5 \u03bcM in a later version of the assay using Ub-Rho [115]). By measuring recovery of 19S DUB activity following rapid dilution of the enzyme/37 complex, the inhibitor was shown to be reversible. b-AP15 is not an indiscriminate DUB inhibitor, since in isolated DUB assays it does not inhibit USP2/7/8, UCHL1, UCHL3 or BAP1 at 50 \u03bcM. Even though 19S inhibitory potency was modest, the Linder group showed that 37 inhibited tumour progression in four different in vivo solid tumour models in mice (2.5\u20135 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection), validating the 19S regulatory particle as a new anticancer drug target.",

A small amount of SAR has been described around 37 by using an HCT116 cell viability assay [115], [117], [118]. It was found that the acrylamide group was non-essential, and that replacing both nitro groups with fluorine had almost no effect on HCT116 cell viability. Only adding hydroxy groups to both phenyl rings (38) caused a significant 10-fold reduction of effect (Figure 22\n). However, this could be due to poor cell penetration rather than a change in USP14/UCHL5 affinity. A ring-expanded analogue of b-AP15 (VLX1570, 39) was twofold more potent in this HCT116 assay (EC50\n = 0.58 \u03bcM) and also had improved aqueous solubility making it suitable for i.v. injection [115]. In an isolated 19S assay, 39 had an IC50 of 6.4 \u03bcM. The Linder group explain the 10-fold loss of potency between cellular EC50 and isolated 19S IC50, not through off-target polypharmacology, but by enrichment of the compound in cells [117]. They supported their hypothesis by showing that 39 inhibits USP14 at 1 \u03bcM in a whole-cell activity probe assay. The labelling of UCHL5 in this assay, however, was \u2018less consistent\u2019.",

A full description of our findings, along with X-ray structures of other DUB/ligand complexes, will be the subject of a future publication. However, Figure 27\nshows the location of the inhibitor (purple (dark grey in the print version)) overlaid with the published structure of USP14CD (blue (dark grey in the print version)) bound to ubiquitin aldehyde (orange (grey in the print version)) (PDB: 2AYO) [33]. The viewing orientation is the same as that used in Figures 5, 6 and 10. The electron density of the USP14 inhibitor overlaps with that of ubiquitin aldehyde from 2AYO, indicating that its inhibitory mechanism is to block the ubiquitin pocket and prevent the ubiquitinated substrate binding. The site of binding, between the fingers and palm regions, is similar to how compound 8 binds into SARS-CoV PLpro, and may also be similar with how the Genentech fragments bind to the USP7 CD (see Section 4.3.3).",

Secondly, a closer inspection reveals that not all DUBs are created equal. Some are definitely more amenable to small-molecule intervention than others. This is not surprising given the wide variety of size, tertiary structure and reliance on extra domains among this diverse family.",

The assumption, in the absence of X-ray structures for the vast majority of DUBs, is that the active sites of DUBs do not commonly contain \u2018small-molecule-shaped\u2019 binding pockets since they have been optimised instead to recognise the narrow Ub(1\u201374)-Gly75-Gly76-\u025b-Lys-R motif of their substrates (see Section 1). This is supported by several studies which illustrate that the C-terminus of ubiquitin, without the remainder of ubiquitin present, has little DUB-binding affinity. Stein et al. showed with a range of peptide-AMC substrates based on the C-terminus of ubiquitin that USP5 (IsoT) requires at least the pentapeptide Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (residues 72\u201376 of ubiquitin) for appreciably efficient catalysis. The k\nc/K\nm values dropped more than 1000-fold when the substrate was truncated to Z-Gly-Gly-AMC [153]. Likewise Borodovsky et al. found that the 12-mer peptide-VMS containing residues 65\u201376 of ubiquitin was required to prevent a variety of USP enzymes in cell lysates from reacting with[125I]-Ub-VMS. The corresponding 10-mer and smaller VMS-capped peptides were unable to inhibit the USP enzymes at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM [154].",

            "text": "In addition to the active site's shape, the large conformational changes exhibited by some DUBs upon ubiquitin binding suggest that the flexibility of their active sites may pose an additional challenge for optimally fitting an inhibitor. Associated with this is the fact that, for some DUBs, the active site cysteine may not be nucleophilic in the absence of ubiquitin-mediated activation. This would be expected to pose a problem for active site binders bearing \u2018drug-like\u2019 warheads with limited electrophilicity. However, as stated in Section 4.4.1, we have found that this is not the case. This suggests that the binary activated/inactivated model suggested by X-ray studies for UCHL1 is too simplistic to explain the good inhibitory properties of compounds containing \u2018drug-like\u2019 warheads. Nonetheless, for other DUBs, it is evident from the inhibitors described in this review that highly reactive compounds have been required to covalently block (presumably) the active site cysteine. These approaches are unattractive because such high levels of reactivity usually lead to poor in vivo exposure and selectivity. These include the probable oxidative examples (14, 15, 36, 59 and 60), alkylating examples (39, 52, 54 and 57) and arylating examples (18 and 24). We recognise that this analysis of \u2018drug-likeness\u2019 and attractiveness is subjective, dependent on the unmet need of the disease in question, and also built on assumptions. For example, despite containing electrophilic enone groups, it may be that compounds 37 and 39 are too sterically hindered to react covalently with proteins. This would be consistent with the reported reversibility of 37, and the fact that in vivo efficacy can be achieved with low doses.",

Conversely, during the course of our research on several therapeutically important DUBs [46], [47], [155], [156], we have discovered covalent active site series which are \u2018drug-like\u2019, unrelated to any previously described DUB inhibitor, exhibit good oral bioavailability and have EC50s less than 100 nM in cell-based assays.

The collaboration with Biogen is also an indicator of confidence in the developable nature of the series. The X-ray structure of an example from this series in USP14 CD (Figure 27) shows that it binds in a \u2018small-molecule drug-shaped\u2019 cavity between the palm and finger regions.

Almac Discovery received an upfront payment of $14.5 million and is eligible for up to $349 million in further payments if it achieves predetermined milestones [157]. Given their shared interest in USP7 (see Section 4.3.3), it is likely that this USP is the target. Since Genentech found fragments that bind in the palm of USP7, this may again be evidence that more generally USPs have druggable sites in this palm/finger region. The co-crystallised X-ray structures of the SARS-CoV PLpro leads such as 8 (see Figure 10) add further weight to this theory, since structurally this viral DUB is similar to the USP family [25].",
