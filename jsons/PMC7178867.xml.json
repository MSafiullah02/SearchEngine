Many researchers and practitioners consider skills in mathematical modelling to be different from skills in mathematics. George (1988) states that \u201cmodel building is an activity which students often find difficult and sometimes rather puzzling. The process of model building requires skills other than simply knowing the appropriate mathematics\u201d (George 1988). Modelling \u201ccan be learnt but not taught in a usual way\u201d (Neunzert and Siddiqi 2000). Relationships between mathematical competencies of students and their skills in modelling were investigated in Galbraith and Haines (1998). Caron and Belair in their exploratory study (2007) examined the phases of the mathematical modelling process that received greater attention from undergraduate students and the competences that were displayed in each phase. They suggested that \u201csome modelling heuristics should be explicitly taught.\u201d They also suggested that \u201cmore time should be spent discussing the purpose of a model: this would help students clarify the expected outcome and benefits of each stage\u201d (Caron and Belair 2007).",

Taking into account uncertainty and a variety of possible models and a number of assumptions in each model, the task of prediction cannot have the \u2018correct\u2019 answer. This fact alone can confuse many students. This chapter investigates students\u2019 opinions regarding differences in predictions from three different models based on the same real data. The task given to the students might look very simple. They neither needed to build a model nor solve the given models. All they needed to do was to read the given real life problem, look at the predictions from three different models and give their reasons for the differences in the predictions. We tested one of the modelling competences described by Kaiser in (2007): \u201cRelating back to the real situation and interpreting the solution in a real-world context\u201d. We also gave the same task to university lecturers who teach mathematics or mathematical modelling courses. Our idea was to compare the responses of the students and lecturers. The main research question was to investigate possible patterns within each group and also similarities and differences between the two groups when they do the same modelling task. In particular, to which extent the two groups use their intuition, common sense and past experience explaining the differences in predictions from three familiar models.",

A measure of attainment for stages of modelling has been developed in (Haines and Crouch 2001). The authors expanded their study in (Crouch and Haines 2004) where they compared undergraduates (novices) and engi\u00adneering research students (experts). They suggested a three-level classification of the developmental processes which the learner passes in moving from novice behaviour to that of an expert. One of the conclusions of that research was that \u201cstudents are weak in linking mathematical world and the real world, thus supporting a view that students need much stronger experiences in building real world mathematical world connections\u201d (Crouch and Haines 2004). This was consistent with the findings from the study by Klymchuk and Zverkova (2001) on possible practical, not cognitive reasons for students\u2019 difficulties linking mathematics and real world. Referring to that study Crouch and Haines wrote: \u201c\u2026students across nine countries all tended to feel that they found moving from the real world to the mathematical world difficult because they lacked such practice in application tasks\u201d (Crouch and Haines 2004).",

            "text": "Infectious diseases hit mankind from time to time on a large scale. In the mid-fourteenth century, the Black Death plague epidemic killed one-third of the population of Europe \u2013 34 million people. In 1563, up to half of the population of London died from the Bubonic plague. In 1918 the Spanish Flu pandemic killed, by different estimations, from 50 to 100 million people worldwide (Patterson and Pyle 1991). An estimated 500 million people were infected. In 1957 the Asian Flu killed up to 4 million people. In 2003 a new highly infectious disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world. In March 2003 the WHO, for the first time in history, issued a global warning about the disease. Globally 8,422 people were infected and 916 died. Hong Kong was one of the countries that was hit most by the disease: 1,755 people were infected and 299 died. \u201cPredicting the trend of an epidemic from limited data during early stages of the epidemic is often futile and sometimes misleading. Nevertheless, early prediction of the magnitude of an epidemic outbreak is immeasurably more important than retrospective studies\u201d (Hsieh et al. 2004). Two common types of epidemic models were used to analyze the spread of SARS in Hong Kong. The first type was a long-established susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and its modifications. The model was developed by Kermack and McKerdrick (1927). The fixed population N is divided into three distinct groups: Susceptible (S) (those at risk of the disease), Infected (I    ) (those that have it), and Removed (R) (those that are quarantined, dead or have acquired immunity). That is: N  =  S + I  +  R. The model is represented by the following system of differential equations:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lll}\\frac{\\text{d}S}{\\text{d}t}=-rSI\\\\ \\frac{\\text{d}I}{\\text{d}t}=rSI-aI\\\\ \\frac{\\text{d}R}{\\text{d}t}=aI\\end{array}\\right. $$\n\\end{document} where r  >  0 is the infection rate and 0  <  a < 1 is the removal rate.",

Predicting the course of the disease \u2013 how many people would be infected, how long it would last \u2013 was important to officials trying to minimize the impact of the disease. A number of mathematical models of the spread of SARS were developed to make the predictions. Below are three simple models of the spread of SARS in Hong Kong. We measure time t, in days since March 17, the date the World Health Organization (WHO) started to publish daily SARS reports. Let P(t) be the total number of cases reported in Hong Kong by day  t. On March 17, Hong Kong reported 95 cases. We compare predictions for June 12, the last day a new case was reported in Hong Kong (87 days since March 17). The constants in the differential equations were determined using WHO data from 17 to 31 March (15 days).",
