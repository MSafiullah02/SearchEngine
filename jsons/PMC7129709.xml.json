            "text": "To deal with donor-derived infections in organ transplant recipients, we have to take into account the two sides of the same coin. In one side we have safety, as it is the most important issue to care about. On the other side, organ shortage is, nowadays, the most important barrier for a successful transplantation. Actually, many patients die while they are awaiting a life-saving transplantation, so any policy regarding the risk for infection transmission through organ transplantation should minimize adverse events but maximizing the availability of life-saving organs. Transmission of infection has been clearly documented via organ and tissue allografts. Organ donors need to be adequately screened for the presence of latent or active infections that may be transmitted through transplantation. A first step in the screening process is a complete medical and social history including travel and epidemiological exposure. Additionally, several microbiological screening tests should be used in the evaluation of an organ donor as it has been stated by some recent scientific guidelines and national and international regulations. The parameters for the election of these assays should be based on clinical parameters. Increased sensitivity may incur false positive assay results result in discarding of uninfected donor tissues. However, the transmission of potentially fatal or life threatening diseases requires selection of an assay that optimizes sensitivity. Decisions must be based on the urgency of transplantation, the availability of alternate therapies or grafts, and of treatments for the disease screened. Some documented infections preclude organ donation (HIV, uncontrolled sepsis, rabies, etc), but many others (cytomegalovirus, most bacterial infections, HCV, HBV, etc) do not stop the organ donation process, but may modify the election of the recipient or to treat the recipient with the adequate antimicrobial therapy. It s clear that a mandatory and timely reporting of transmission events to procurement organizations and public health authorities is crucial in the management of donor-derived infections. Clinicians require education on reportable events including specified clinical syndromes and the mechanisms available for these reports. In general, allograft recipients with evidence of unexplained infection early after graft placement, with recovery or recognition of common or unusual organisms, or with uncommon clinical syndromes merit reporting.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of anaerobic bacteria using dilution methods such as broth microdilution and agar dilution (described in the CLSI guideline M11-A7) has been and still is the gold standard. For many years these methods have been used primarily for research and surveillance of national and local susceptibility patterns in order to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents for empirical therapy. However, as increasing resistance has been observed for many of the frequently encountered anaerobic bacteria, there is a need for more simple methods in the routine clinical microbiology laboratory. Gradient strips are used as a simple but expensive method for AST. Disk diffusion on Wilkins-Chalgren agar (former CLSI recommended agar) for anaerobic bacteria has also been evaluated several years ago, and although results were promising at that time, the method has not been generally accepted. With the introduction of the EUCAST disk diffusion method the intention was to develop a standardised method for anaerobic bacteria. The following test conditions were suggested: the Brucella Blood Agar medium supplemented with hemin and vitamin K (BBA, currently recommended by the CLSI) with strictly controlled test conditions (temperature, atmosphere and time of incubation). The use of the disk diffusion method was limited to rapidly growing (<24 hours) anaerobic bacteria such as members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, Clostridium spp. and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Studies on BBA are in progress and preliminary studies with Bacteroides fragilis group and Fusobacterium necrophorum reference strains have been promising. Furthermore, studies with clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile shows that isolates with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin can be separated from wild-type isolates with disk diffusion. Clostridium perfringens or other Clostridium spp. may well be the next candidates to be evaluated for AST with disk diffusion. Although the reference methods are still the AST methods of choice for a large number of slow growing anaerobic species, disk diffusion seems to be a potential alternative for certain rapidly growing anaerobic bacteria.",

It is possible that they shape the genome at least in terms of the diversity of strains found worldwide as well as contribute to virulence evolution. Phylogenic analysis of the phage integrase gene showed a pattern of biogeographic separation. This is in agreement with a model of co-evolution between the virus and its bacterial host since biogeographic separation is also observed within H. pylori. A model of geographically constrained viral dispersal also fits, i.e. H. pylori from different geographical regions may have been infected by distinct phage lineages after the geographic separation of the bacterial host. Another hypothesis could be that after bacterial infection with the virus, the divergence of the bacterium is also accompanied by divergence of the integrated virus. It has been argued that H. acinonychis strain Sheeba is derived from H. pylori and that the prophage was acquired after the host jump from human to feline. An equally likely scenario is that the prophage was present in the bacterial genome before the host jump.",

            "text": "Lund and O'Brien (2011) suggest that 15\u201320% of the population may be regarded as vulnerable to food borne infection. This is not a homogeneous group. Vulnerability is often considered in terms of increased likelihood of infection on exposure or increased risk of serious adverse outcome from infection but increased frequency or intensity of exposure should also be considered. Some vulnerable groups are clearly demarcated by physiological or pathological condition (pregnant women, HIV/AIDS etc). Therapies associated with increased risk include cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunomodulators (e.g. anti-TNF) and proton pump inhibitors. Infants and older people are also vulnerable although age boundaries between \u201cnormal\u201d and increased risk are somewhat arbitrary. Poverty, poor education and lack of access to facilities for hygienic storage and preparation increase frequency and intensity of exposure. We can consider four categories of microbe (i) classical pathogens (e.g. salmonella) (ii) pathogens of at risk groups (e.g. L. monocytogenes) (iii) environmental organisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and (iv) cultures promoted as probiotic (Lactobacillus casei) Industrially prepared or catered foods should be free of classical pathogens. A challenging issue in relation to pathogens of at risk groups is the extent to which food-safety for vulnerable groups can be addressed by labelling/education as opposed to zerotolerance. Environmental species that occur in fresh fruit and vegetables are associated with infection in neutropaenic patients but avoiding these foods does not reduce infection. Foods containing \u201cprobiotic\u201d cultures have been associated with infection but this is not common. Balancing the protection of vulnerable groups with public preferences for diverse and traditionally/minimally processed foods is a challenge. Also one needs to ensure that the quality of life of vulnerable people is not unduly impaired by loss of favourite foods and beverages. Freshly prepared thoroughly cooked food and freshly prepared washed fruit and vegetables are safe. Boiling water for 1 minute is a failsafe for immune-compromised patients; but reputable bottled waters or properly filtered/treated waters and pasteurised bottled/packaged beverages are unlikely to cause problems. Animal products that have not had thermal treatment or equivalent should be avoided, likewise certain processed/catered foods that are at high risk for contamination with L. monocytogenes.",

Although clusters of late-onset neonatal listeriosis have been identified in newborn nurseries, demonstrating that nosocomial transmission is possible, 99% of cases are foodborne. Nosocomial outbreaks of listeriosis are relatively infrequent, but at least eight outbreaks were reported in England and Wales from 1999 to 2011. In Germany in Oct. 2007, one public health office reported that two patients had stayed in the same hospital before the onset of listeriosis. Active case finding with retrospectively investigated listeriosis notifications from the state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was performed. All available isolates from 2006 to 2008 were characterized by PFGE. Altogether, 16 cases were identified, with 11 patients linked to hospital A (begin Dec. 2006); their nine available isolates were indistinguishable from an isolate of a food sample previously obtained during a routine inspection in food company A. This ready-to-eat cold cut sausage (used for Wurstsalat) was identified as source of the outbreak. Food items served in hospitals could be classified as \u201cfood intended for special medical purposes\u201d- as defined in the Commission Directive 1999/21/EC. This would include the absence of L. monocytogenes in 25 g food. However, this special food is only considered for patients with severe neutropenia (<0.5 \u00d7 10^9/L, \u22656 days). In fact, none of the patients reviewed from hospital A met this criterion and consequently all of them had received regular food during their stay in hospital. In Oct. 2010 in Texas, company B had to recall all products shipped since Jan. (outbreak-begin). The 10 patients (five fatal) were shown to have recently eaten in hospital settings. Food and environmental samples were collected from the hospitals; the strain was found in chicken salad made with prepackaged, diced celery. Tracing the celery back led to company B. Cut celery was sold to restaurant and institutional settings, not grocery stores. In Austria (total population: 8.3 millions) on average one out of three citizens stays in a hospital each year (2 678 627 hospital-admissions; mean 6.8 day; median: 3.9 day). Due to the prevailing high hygienic standards of hospital kitchens, ready-to-eat food remain a residual risk.

            "text": "A vaccine that efficiently prevents infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is unlikely to become available in the near future. A vaccine to prevent disease is a feasible alternative approach, the development of which is a goal that appears achievable in the particular context of pregnancy-associated malaria. The evidence base for this assertion rests on several interconnected epidemiological, parasitological and immunological observations. At the epidemiological level it is known that, in areas with stable transmission of malaria, primigravid women are more susceptible than multigravidae, both to infection with P. falciparum and to its pathological consequences. The latter are directly related to the fact that parasite-infected erythrocytes (PfiE) accumulate in the placenta resulting, especially in primigravidae, in frequently intense monocytic inflammatory activity. Multigravidae are rendered less susceptible by the specific immunity they have acquired over the course of earlier pregnancies. That immunity is characterized by the antibody-based, gender-specific nature of the response to a particular parasite-derived protein antigen expressed on the surface of PfiE. The protein in question acts as a ligand that mediates adhesive interactions between PfiE and a placental receptor, chondroitin sulphate A (CSA), expressed on syncytiotrophoblasts. The antigen is referred to as VAR2CSA, a designation derived from the fact that it is encoded by a gene of the var family, members of which are responsible for the production of PfEMP1 proteins. Although indeed polymorphic, a characteristic of all PfEMP1 proteins, VAR2CSA displays a comparatively reduced degree of variability. The latter is emphasized by the fact that the antibodies acquired by multigravidae living in a given distinct geographical region can inhibit the adherence to CSA of infected erythrocytes from placentas of women living elsewhere. The detailed molecular understanding of the processes involved now available thus provides the foundation for the on-going efforts aimed at developing a VAR2CSA-based vaccine. Such a vaccine would represent an extremely valuable additional tool with which to reduce the burden of disease both in mothers and their offspring.",

The main impact of such chronic T. cruzi infection in pregnancy is the transmission of parasites to foetuses (occurring in 0.1% to 12% of infected pregnant women) and the development of a congenital Chagas disease. Detection of infection during pregnancy can be performed using serological tests. Serological testing is recommended for pregnant women who are living in disease endemic areas, or in disease non-endemic areas and are born or have lived previously in disease endemic areas or whose mothers were born in such areas. There is no way to identify, in advance, those infected mothers who will transmit the infection to their foetuses. Anti-parasitic treatment is not recommended during pregnancy and congenital infection cannot be prevented. There is presently an international consensus (WHO Technical Group on control of congenital Chagas disease) to recommend detection of congenital infection in newborns of infected mothers with treatment of positive neonates, as the best strategy for limiting short-term morbidity and mortality of acute congenital infection, and preventing long-term effects of Chagas disease. Detection of living parasites can be performed by microscopic examination of umbilical cord or neonate venous blood (microhemat-ocrit test) or other parasitological tests (e.g. hemoculture). PCR assays can detect low amounts of T. cruzi DNA, but their standardization and validation are still under development. Detection of IgM and IgA antibodies and placental histopathology are not contributing to such diagnosis. In case of negative results close to birth, detection of specific antibodies using standard serological assays can be carried out 8\u201310 months after birth, i.e. when antibodies transferred from the mothers have been eliminated. A positive serological result at this time indicates that the infant is currently infected. Cases of congenital T. cruzi infection should be treated with benznidazol or nifurtimox as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed. Treatment is generally successful and without the adverse reactions seen in adults if administered within the first year of life.",

It was also observed that colistin concentrations are virtually constant between two consecutive administrations at steady-state with no real peak nor trough values. Furthermore colistin concentrations increase slowly after treatment initiation and it takes about 2 days before reaching steady-state suggesting the need for loading dose. These data were further confirmed in a study conducted on a greater number of critical care patients including some on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement (3). It was shown that CMS loading dose could be adjusted to body weight and maintenance dose to creatinine clearance (3).

The median half-life of active colistin is 9.1 hours in critically-ill patients with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies show that doses higher than those conventionally used in Europe are needed. Loading doses, amounting to the total daily dose, are recommended in critically-ill patients. Colistimethate sodium (produg) and colistin are efficiently removed by hemodialysis; daily doses of 6 million international units (MIU) are recommended for patients undergoing continuous hemofiltration and 1 MIU with intermittent hemodialysis.

Colistin was associated with lower mortality than no effective treatment and higher unadjusted mortality than beta-lactams in non-randomized comparative clinical studies. Two studies comparing colistin to inappropriate antibiotic treatment showed lower mortality with colistin, pooled odds ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.24\u20131.08). Prospective studies or matched retrospective studies (N = 7) showed a pooled OR for death of 1.40 (95% confidence intervals 1.07\u20131.84), indicating significantly higher mortality with colistin.

At the beginning Enerobacteriaceae successfully developed a suite of TEM, SHV and CTXM ESBLs, further supplemented with carbapenemases: KPC and MBLs with VIM, IMP, and recently acquired NDM. Overuse of recent cefalosporins and carbapenems triggered over-expression of AmpC enzymes (CMY, DHA) and their dissemination on plasmids. Simultaneously, these bacteria acquired plasmids encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes conferring resistance to one or more particular aminoglycosides. Recently, plasmid-borne 16S rRNA methylases triggering broad-spectrum aminoglycoside-resistance have been reported in MDR Enterobacteriaceae. GNB managed to settle in hospitals due to fluoroquinolone- resistance. Selection of such strains is facilitated by plasmid-mediated factors (PMQR) which shield the polymerase subunits (Qnr), remove (QepA efflux pump) or modify fluoroquinolones (aac[6\u2032]-Ib-cr). The aforementioned resistance-traits in GNB have been reported in Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Pakistan, Israel, Greece, Italy, Spain, Poland, France, Belgium, USA, Basil, and Australia. In many of these countries MDR-GNB challenge public health. MDR-GN increased rapidly in those areas of the globe, where antibiotics are over-used in medicine, veterinary and agriculture. The recent spread of KPC from the USA to Europe, NDM from India to Europe, Canada and Australia, strongly suggests that MDR-GNB are of global concern. Recent studies on molecular mechanisms of MDR in GNB show these bacteria tend to accumulate different resistance traits with preference for broad-range traits like carbapenemases, 16Sr RNA methylases and various PMQR mechanisms.",

This remarkably effective approach has enabled antileukaemic therapy also in fragile and co-morbid patients formerly excluded from myelosuppressive treatment modalities. However, since the malignant clone is not eradicated, this treatment is indefinite and typically results in emerging resistance and clinical relapse. And although further non-myeloablative treatment modalities including histone deacetylase inhibitors or multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed also for leukaemia treatment in recent years, all these approaches will not substitute the classical myelablative chemotherapy in the treatment of acute leukaemias.",

This talk will focus on the role of the innate immune system in both host defence to and the pathology of tuberculosis. The principal innate inflammatory cells involved in host defence are phagocytic cells of the macrophage lineage including multi-nucleate giant cells but others including stromal cells, neutrophils and NK cells are of key importance. The innate immune response acting through a series of pattern recognition receptors orchestrates the host response by secreting a range of mediators, cytokines and chemokines. Innate immunity targets the pathogen by secretion of molecules such as cathelicidins and defensins. In addition, by upregulating gene expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, it is critical to the destruction of host tissue. This is both the pre-requisite for the spread of infection and the hallmark of severe infection leading to morbidity and mortality. Innate immune function is influenced by the physiological and metabolic environment. In this talk, the diverse aspects of innate immunity will be discussed and the potential for the novel application of immune modulators to improve patient outcomes will be examined.",

The question has been raised, whether repeated and continued use of biocidal substances can lead to the promotion of biocide resistance or even antibiotic resistance. In the assessment of available data on resistance it is crucial to use appropriate definitions. While antibiotic resistance is usually defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration above the level that is reached in affected human tissue, biocide resistance should be defined as a significantly increased biocidal concentration needed to pass accepted disinfectant test standards. Use of sublethal biocide concentrations can lead to phenotypic adaptation of microbes, which is different from resistance, which is hereditary. It can also select for unspecific resistance mechanisms, which confer cross resistance to antibiotics. This has not been observed, when biocides are used at microbicidal concentrations. In several studies clinical isolates from infected patients did not demonstrate any resistance to biocidal substances used in the same setting. While antibiotics target specific microbial structures or metabolic processes, biocides have broad and unspecific mechanisms of action and target sites. It is concluded that appropriate use of disinfectants and antiseptics in infection prevention using concentrations defined by tests according to accepted standards does not bear a relevant risk of the development of biocide resistance or promotion of antibiotic resistance.",

Against this background of resistant isolates, strains and clones, one must consider the complexity of genes, integrons, transposons and plasmids that confer resistance. These fundamental units of resistance spread through bacterial populations vertically, by association with successful strains or lineages, or horizontally between strains, species and genera. Applying an epidemiological aspect to these molecular investigations additionally requires us to factor in whether the resistant bacteria were isolated from humans (in hospital, nursing home, or community settings), animals (food production, companion or wild), foodstuffs, or environmental samples and should ideally include denominators, and demographic, temporal and geographic data. The depth of any investigation will ultimately depend on its goals and the resources available. The nature of multiresistance in Enterobacteriaceae is highly complex, involving spread or repeated selection of successful clonal lineages, and horizontal spread of resistance plasmids. Local investigations are useful for guiding infection control, but maximum information is obtained if they can be set into a national or international context.

This may be due to any of these reasons or their combinations: increased virulence (which is rarely proved), delayed appropriate therapy (because the probability of prescribing inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is increased), and diminished efficacy or increased toxicity of available second-line drugs. In the case of Enterobacteriaceae, invasive infections caused by ESBL-producers have been shown to be associated with increased mortality; we may assume that the effect is similar for isolates producing other mechanisms of resistance. Infections caused by MDR-E occur more frequently in predisposed patients, as those with underlying diseases, admitted to healthcare centres or undergone invasive procedures, and who had recently received antimicrobial treatment, but may also happen increasingly in healthy patients with community-acquired infections. Thus, in front of patients with serious infections, clinicians frequently need to decide between the empirical use of very broad spectrum antimicrobials (and even second-line drugs) to cover MDR-E, or to reserve them in order to avoid further spread of resistance. Several clues may help in this decision making-process. First, pre-test probability may be estimated in base of local prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Second, evaluation of the individual risk factors for MDR-E may help to identify patients with lower or higher risk for infections caused by these organisms (post-test probability). And third, a careful assessment of the severity of acute disease and systemic inflammatory response syndrome would help to identify patients in which appropriate empirical therapy is an absolute priority. In the absence of randomised clinical trials, decisions for empirical therapy, de-escalation strategies, and use of alternative agents in different situations need to be based on a deep knowledge on the available microbiologic data, PK/PD models, and clinical studies. It follows that management of acute infections in the 21st century demands a certain degree of super-specialisation for performing an adequate and timely clinical work-up, correctly identifying the potential source of infection and severity, and the specific determinants that modify the potential risks, aetiologies and antimicrobial susceptibility, so that the decisions about antimicrobial therapy can be optimised.",

To understand how these antibiotics are made and provide genetic information for constructing hybrid pathways we have analysed the thiomarinol biosynthetic genes and used this to underpin further analysis on both pathways. As with the mupirocin cluster the thiomarinol cluster encodes its own isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the known target for mupirocin. Cloning these resistance genes from both the mup and the tml clusters in E coli showed that the TmlM protein confers complete resistance to thiomarinol but that the MupM only confers resistance to mupirocin. Targeted gene knockouts allowed the derivation of strains that produce the pyrrothine but no marinolic acid, marinolic acid but no pyrrothine or both of these components separately but with no production of thiomarinol. The mutant unable to produce marinolic acid was fed with mupirocin and was shown to produce a novel analogue of thiomarinol that was able to inhibit the growth of mupirocin-resistant MRSA. The tmlU gene is responsible for joining marinolic acid and pyrrothine together for production of thiomarinol but surprisingly when introduced into the mupirocin producer TmlU appears to interfere with the elongation of the 9 hydroxynonanoic acid component. We are also testing whether amide synthetases related to TmlU can substitute for it in this reaction, thus allowing a larger number of diverse substrates to be used. We are also manipulating the expression of genes of the mupirocin cluster in order to increase production but without accumulation of side products such as Pseudomonic acid B.",

We isolated several antibiotics such as pentabromopseudilins, andrimide and tropodithietic acid that have been found in marine bacteria before. We also isolated several antibiotics such as holomycin and indolmycin that are known antibiotics hithero only isolated from terrestrial Streptomycetes. The fact that we predominantly found already known antibiotics could be because we used the same growth conditions as many previous studies. Genome sequencing of one Pseudoalteromonas strain from which two antibiotics were isolated revealed that at least seven PKS/NRPS genes were found. Hence manipulating culture conditions, or expression in other hosts, may induce expression of hithero silent genes coding for bioactive metabolites. Certainly culturing one of the antibiotic producing Vibrionaceae on a substrate mimicking its natural conditions by containing exclusively chitin as C- and N-source, led to a dramatic alteration in secondary metabolite profile. Under these natural growth conditions, the antibiotic became almost the only metabolite produced. Some strains of the Vibrionaceae also produced compounds, so-called solonamides, that were not antibacterial per se but that specifically inhibited the quorum sensing system in Staphylococcus aureus likely via binding to the Agr. Also the quorum sensing system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by a yet un-identified compound produced by Roseobacter clade strains. Whilst it is known that both Roseobacter clade bacteria and Pseudoalteromonas species produce bioactive compounds, the Vibrionaceae have predominantly been researched due to their role as pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria. Our work demonstrates that this bacterial group likely also harbours organisms of biotechnological interest.",

Nevertheless, it could not assess particular infection. EMB remains gold-standard, even if scarcely performed. Specific treatments are recommended only for proved cardiac infection, that is theorically in case of positive endomyocardialbiopsy (EMB). Among numerous infectious agents, specific treatment is then available: bacterial infections (in case of severe sepsis, Lyme, tuberculosis, \u2026), parasitic (Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis,\u2026) and mainly in case of viral infections: coxsackiesviruses, CMV, EBV, HIV\u2026 Immunomodulation could endly offer new possibilities of treatments: cytokine modulation could help to redirect wrong immunological answer. Interferon could help in several situations, illustrating importance of immunomodulation. New medical hypotheses are actually explored, such as arrhythmias, and possibly specific actions of non specific treatments, or even interest of cardiac frequency. Non specific treatments aim at improving cardiac physiology: CEI, ARB, beta-blockers. In case of severe left ventricular dysfunction, spironolactone is also possible. Diuretics are often necessary for symptom relief. These treatments are probably also involved in other therapeutic ways, especially through anti-inflammatory effects (CEI or ARB mainly).

Candida albicans was the most common isolate (45.8%), followed by C. parapsilosis (25.1%), C. glabrata (13.6%), C. tropicalis (8%), C. krusei (2.1%) and others (5.4%). Antifungal susceptibility was tested in 650 isolates. Overall rate of fluconazole resistance (MIC >4 mcg/mL) was 14.6%. Crude mortality rate was 37.7% (13% within 7 day, 29.7% within 30 day). On multivariate analysis, CVC removal within the first 48 hours (OR, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.16\u20130.86) was a protective factor for early mortality, and Pitt score \u22652 (OR, 3.3; 95%CI, 1.3\u20138.2) and C. krusei candidemia (OR, 3.9; 95%CI, 1.01\u201315) were associated with early death. Intubation was associated with late mortality (OR, 2.7; 95%CI, 1.6\u20134.5).",

The near absence of antimicrobial related investment in both large and small pharmaceutical companies means that the critical paucity of novel antibiotics that can be used to treat infections by MDR pathogens will continue for many years. Pharmaceutical pipelines barely trickle calling for alternative business and funding models. An intensified action plan recently introduced by the European Commission, along with joint international activities, will hopefully prime antibacterial pipelines. However, until the action plans bear fruit, several new antibacterial drugs based on known classes of antibiotics may become available in the next few years.

The high proportion of adults affected and the extreme high number of patients (22.2%) developing Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) makes it the most dramatic ever seen since Stx-producing E. coli (STEC) were first described as human pathogens. The characteristics of the outbreak strain, the way it spread among humans and the resulting clinical pictures have changed the way STEC are regarded as human pathogens in general. EAHEC O104:H4 and other EAHEC serotypes belong to an emerging E. coli pathotype which is endemic in Africa and has spread to Europe and Asia. Other STEC O104 strains, such as STEC O104:H2, O104:H7 and O104:H21 were implicated in outbreaks and sporadic infections of humans in different countries but these are fundamentally different from the EAHEC O104:H4 strain, as they do not possess enteroaggregative properties. EAHEC O104:H4 have evolved from enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) by uptake of an Stx2a encoding bacteriophage. No other virulence markers of classical enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) including the chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) are present in EAHEC strains. EAHEC O104:H4 colonizes humans through AAF-pili encoded by the EAEC-plasmid. The EAHEC O104:H4 strains possess the full virulence characteristics of EAEC (aatA, aggA/agg3A, aggR, aap, set1 and pic). The AAF colonization mechanism substitutes the LEE functions for bacterial adherence and delivery of Stx2a into the human intestine resulting clinically in HUS. Humans are the only known natural reservoir for EAEC and EAHEC. In contrast, classical STEC and EHEC are associated with animals as natural hosts. Contaminated sprouted seeds produced in Northern Germany were identified as vehicle of transmission of the EAHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain. Secondary transmission of the pathogen from human to human and human to food/environment was found important. Epidemiological investigations revealed EAHEC O104:H4 contaminated fenugreek seeds as the source of entry of the agent into the food chain. However, microbiological investigations of seeds and sprouts grown from fenugreek seeds were negative. The survival of EAHEC in seeds and the frequency of human carriers of EAHEC need to be explored for a better understanding of EAHEC transmission routes.",

An universal goal is to start appropriate treatment as soon as possible. It is logical that these facts are also valid in patients with invasive fungal infections (IFI). The problem is that IFI are often not easily recognisable and that we can only suspect them in patients at risk. While prospective, randomized studies are lacking, retrospective studies used different criteria of timing, although majority defined time as a period between culture sampling and start of appropriate treatment. Despite this, results uniformly showed that delay is associated with poorer outcome. In patients with candidemia, the importance of timing was assessed analyzing the time period between the time when positive blood cultures were drawn and start of AFT. Delay in treatment \u226512 or \u226524 hours increased hospital mortality 1.5\u20132.06 fold. Negative impact of delayed diagnosis and consequent AFT was shown in patients with candidemia: a 24-delay in blood culture positivity would almost double the risk of patients' death. Studies in hematological patients with invasive aspergillosis or zygomycosis showed that delay of appropriate antifungal therapy (AFT) for more than 10 or 6 days after the appearance of first symptoms almost doubled the mortality rates. The negative impact of treatment delay on patients' outcome urges physicians to start AFT empirically at high-risk patients with clinically suspected IFI (empirical therapy) or after positive new diagnostic tests associated with imaging findings (pre-emptive therapy, mostly for moulds infections). To avoid overtreatment with new, expensive antifungals, rapid diagnostic tests are necessary.",

Incidence of PT quadrupled from 2000 to 2005 and was highest among those younger than 6 months. Because the first PT vaccine is recommended for administration in children at 2 months of age in the US, vaccination of persons caring for or exposed to infants is recommended to decrease transmission and thereby incidence of PT in this at-risk age group. At our rural hospital, opportunities are available to address the vaccination status of patients and a mechanism for administering pneumococcal and influenza vaccines is available. However, no assessment tool or mechanism was available for the nurses to determine appropriateness and administer PT vaccine without a physician order. To increase compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, a tool was developed for nurses to assess a patient's eligibility for PT vaccination and to order vaccine. After education sessions, the tool was implemented for the maternity ward in July 2011. The overall objective of this study was to examine the impact of the tool on the rate of vaccination for PT among post-partum women.",

Their sole function is to induce syncytium formation following infection, making them an ideal model for the study of cellular pathways involved in syncytiogenesis. In this study, we conducted a comparative, temporal analysis of FAST protein- and influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in order to determine whether viral proteins designed for entry and those designed for cell-to-cell fusion elicit a similar response during fusion pore expansion and syncytium formation.",

No less concerning, chronic respiratory infection by P. aeruginosa is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) and a frequent complication of other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis. Due to a complex multifactorial adaptive process, once established, P. aeruginosa chronic infections are almost impossible to eradicate with antibiotics. The underlying factors driving this situation include (i) the transition from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth, associated with a significant reduction of antimicrobial susceptibility, (ii) the extraordinary capacity of P. aeruginosa for acquiring resistance to nearly all available antibiotics through a complex interplay of intrinsic and mutation-driven resistance pathways, (iii) the intense genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification process taking place within the CF lung and (iv) the frequent emergence and fixation of mutator phenotypes, often resulting from a nonfunctional DNA mismatch repair system caused by the inactivation of mutS or mutL genes leading to increased (up to 1000-fold) spontaneous mutation rates. Moreover, results from recent research argue that the four factors are intimately interconnected and act synergistically to establish life-long persistent infections that are highly recalcitrant to the activity of antimicrobial agents: the biofilm mode of growth is found to facilitate development of mutation-driven resistance, selection of mutators, genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification; conversely, mutator phenotypes are shown to significantly enhance mutation-driven resistance, biofilm development, genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification.",

It is however able to cause severe infections in humans and in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients it is the dominant cause of morbidity and mortality due to its persistence in the airways of these patients. Our main objective has been to characterize the evolutionary routes by which these bacteria switch from an environmental life-style to one associated with chronic infections. Helped by a substantial strain collection covering several hundred CF patients with lung infections lasting for up to 35 years we have been able to identify particularly successful clones whose changing genome sequences and global gene expression profiles have constituted an important platform for our analysis. The genome dynamics reflect in many cases the frequent appearance of hyper-mutator strains, in which mutations accumulate with rates which are up to 1000 fold increased relative to what is observed in non-mutator isolates. In these cases the airway populations of P. aeruginosa are highly diverse and adaptation to the changing environments in the CF airways seems to occur at the population level. In contrast, very successful non-mutator clones seem to harbor several mutations in global regulatory genes, which result in highly adapted cells and quite homogeneous airway populations. Through allelic replacement wild-type strains of P. aeruginosa have been constructed, which carry one or more of the identified regulatory mutations from clinical isolates, and the resulting strains display phenotypes with profiles resembling those of the clinical strains. These results suggest that a small number of specific regulatory mutations, altering networks of transcription in the bacteria, may provide the cells with adaptive features that lead to high fitness levels of the bacteria in their new environment. The latest results from these on-going studies of gene regulation in CF isolates and their synthetic counter-parts will be discussed.",

Predictive models in adult non-neutropenic critically ill patients allow stratification and selection of high-risk patients for C/IC who may benefit from early antifungal therapy. Our group has developed and validated the \u201cCandida score\u201d, a predictive model of IC, based on a scoring system for certain variables, which assigns a value of 1 point for surgery, multifocal colonization and parenteral nutrition, and a value of two points severe sepsis. A cutoff of \u22653 is highly reliable to identify patients at high risk of C/IC. Moreover, abdominal surgery increases significantly the risk of C/IC. Based on these results, early antifungal treatment can be specifically directed to patients with multifocal Candida colonization and associated Candida score \u22653 and, in particular, to those with abdominal surgery. This scoring system is simple and may be of help to clinicians to differentiate between Candida spp. colonization and occult invasive fungal infection when early antifungal treatment is considered. Serological tests have been recently added to the diagnostic armamentarium of C/IC, including detection of Candida albicans germ tube antibodies (CAGTA) and (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan (BDG). A recent meta-analysis concluded that BDG has good diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing patients with and without invasive fungal infection. Proper use of this test requires good knowledge of its characteristics, particularly the fungal pathogens that remain undetected and the factors associated with a false-positive result. PCR-based methods to detect Candida spp. directly in blood samples may play an important role in improving the outcome of patients with IC through an earlier and more sensitive diagnosis. A recently published meta-analysis has demonstrated the usefulness of this method, which may accompany blood cultures, although serial sampling may be considered for patients at high risk for IC. This systematic review demonstrated that direct PCR in blood samples may have higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of IC than conventional blood cultures, with a specificity of 90%. Therefore, stratification of patients at high risk for IC with the use of a predictive model of IC together with measurements of biomarkers (BDG and CAGTA) and the possibility of having available diagnostic tests based on real time PCR may change the outcome of patients with IC.",

            "text": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of remarkably diverse DNA viruses from the Papillomaviridae family, which are causally involved in the etiology of various benign and malignant neoplastic lesions of mucosal and skin epithelium. Approximately 40 different HPV types from the alpha genus are known to infect mucosal epithelium, with a subset of 10\u201312 HPV types being associated with lesions that can progress to cancer. These cancer-associated HPVs are designated as high-risk HPV types (hr-HPV) and are the etiological agents of virtually all cervical carcinomas and play the leading etiological role in the development of anal cancer and a substantial proportion of vaginal, penile, vulvar and oropharyngeal (mainly tonsillar) cancers. In view of the fact that persistent infection with hr-HPVs is a necessary etiological factor in the development of cervical carcinoma, HPV testing has become an important part of cervical carcinoma screening and detection algorithms in several countries. Testing for hr-HPVs has four main clinical applications: (i) triage of women with ASC-US or other borderline cytology, (ii) follow-up of women with abnormal screening cytology results who are negative at initial colposcopy/biopsy, (iii) prediction of the outcome after treatment of CIN2+ and (iv) primary screening of women aged 30 years and more in combination with Pap smear. Currently more than 80 different commercial assays for the detection of alpha HPVs are available (reviewed in Poljak M, Kocjan BJ. Exp Rev Anti Infect Ther 2010;8:1139\u201362) and can be provisory divided into five main groups: (i) DNA-based screening assays, which test for the presence of 13\u201314 hour-HPVs without determination of HPV type; (ii) assays that combine testing for 14 hours -HPVs and HPV-16 and HPV-18 genotyping; (iii) HPV DNA based genotyping assays, (iv) mRNA hr-HPV assays and (v) in situ hybridization HPV assays. The vast majority of HPV assays currently on the market are not useful for the established clinical applications and especially not for primary screening. Automation, price reduction and improvement of clinical specificity are the main goals for the future development of HPV assays.",

Nevertheless, studies on sex-related immune response and response to vaccination are needed to define futures strategies for vaccination programs. Gender related responsiveness to vaccines are another issue to be addressed. Gender and immunisation has been a topic to be assessed by the WHO and partner for statistical analysis of demographic health surveys, qualitative systematic review and case studies.

Since 2006, the evolution is marked by the significant increased rate of the ST5-MRSA-VI New Pediatric clone (p = 0.015) and the concerning emergence of the ST22-IV clone (p = 0.006). Besides, this latter has been involved recently in several outbreaks within French neonatal units. Data from DNA microarrays provide a accurate picture of virulence and resistance profiles of the various invasive clones circulating in France and their genetic plasticity.",

Disease severity of DENV infection appears to be controlled by the presence of cross-reactive DENV antibodies directed against the envelope (E) and precursor membrane (prM) by facilitating antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. We recently reported that immature DENV turns highly infectious in the presence of prM antibodies. These antibodies facilitate efficient binding and cell entry of immature particles into Fc-receptor expressing cells. In addition, enzymatic activity of furin present in the endosome is critical to render the internalized immature virus infectious. In this study, we analyzed if antibodies recognizing the E protein can also promote viral infectivity of immature virus particles.",

This approach enhances the specificity and the accuracy of early diagnosis and with the precise administration of antiretroviral drugs, HIV can be managed sustainably. Our POC prototype is based on Multi-marker Cantilever Nanosensors platform that integrates sample sorting (nanopillars) and surface capture chemistries. This technology offers many opportunities for direct detection of proteins such as antigens and antibodies against infectious organisms and potentially for the direct detection of organisms themselves without the need for labelling. Nanopillars acts as microfluidic sieve to separate and concentrate different markers of infection from clinical samples which are present in low copies. The antigens are detected and quantified by flowing across an array of cantilever nanosensors functionalised with carefully selected high affinity capture molecules raised against different (sub) types of HIV virions. Subsequently, the specific biomolecular binding event is translated into a nanomechanical signal analysed by the interference pattern created when they are illuminated by a laser.",

Specifically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative organisms have become a major concern because of limited treatment options, increased lengths of stay (LOS), costs, and mortality associated with infections. In a study of costs associated with MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa mean cost of hospitalization was $54 081 (mean LOS = 18 days) for patients with MDR isolates vs. $22 116 for susceptible isolates. These increased costs could in part be attributed to a delay in appropriate empiric therapy and the delay's adverse affect on clinical outcome and mortality. A similar study of P. aeruginosa bacteremias indicated hospital mortality was statistically higher for inappropriate empiric therapy compared to appropriate empiric therapy (30.7% vs. 17.8%; p = 0.079). Healthcare Associated Pneumonia (HCAP) has been described to differentiate pneumonia patients with risk factors for more resistant pathogens. Recommendations include combination therapy with antipseudomonal beta-lactam and aminoglycoside, which improves the probability of initial appropriate therapy. Another potential impact is synergistic bactericidal effect that may result in faster resolution of symptoms compared to monotherapy.

As decreased susceptibility and therapeutic failure emerges to the current agents of choice in most countries, the extended spectrum cephalosporins, it is paramount that data is obtained and disseminated in a timely manner. To achieve this objective, sentinel surveillance of antimicrobial resistance has been established in 21 countries. Initially testing was centralised and provided annual data but recently has been extended to include decentralised testing and to provide data twice yearly.

Although remarkable progress has been made in lowering the incidence of the disease, the worry is that gonorrhoea is becoming a much more difficult infection to treat, increasing the morbidity and the cost. Recently, scientific communities have been discussing the emergence of an N. gonorrhoeae strain resistant to all antimicrobial drugs available. The new strain is called H041, isolated in Japan, and contains genetic mutations making it resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and also third-generation cephalosporin, including ceftriaxone widely recommended and the first line treatment for gonorrhoea around the world. For that, the multidrug resistant gonococcus may be considered a superbug that initiates a future era of untreatable gonorrhoea. The resistance to ESCs (extended-spectrum cephalosporins) such as cefixime and ceftriaxone, has been documented to be due to the presence of multiple chromosomal changes in the penA gene that form the basis for this reduced susceptibility/resistance. So, the antimicrobial resistant (AMR-NG), multidrug resistant (MDR-NG) and more recently the extensively drug resistant N. gonorrhoeae (XDR-NG) to different class of antibiotics, are an important public health concern for gonorrhoea. Data from the European surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhoea by M. Cole et al 2011, showed that 5% of isolates had decreased susceptibility to cefixime, an upward trend in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ceftriaxone and a high prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin (63%) and azithromycin (13%). In Italy, from 2007 to 2011 around 700 isolates have been tested for their antimicrobials susceptibility. In particular, among 114 gonococci isolated in 2009, seven showed a MDR phenotype due to a resistance to four different antibiotics including cefixime (MIC \u2265 0.125 mg/L). Enhancing systematic and sentinel surveillance for AMR and MDR gonorrhoea by promoting the susceptibility testing and studying the genetic mechanisms of the resistance are priority as key points for a control strategy and for combating the spread of MDR gonococci. A sustained and integrated international effort to reduce rates of gonorrhoea and the misuse of antibiotics is required to stem further emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains.",

M. marinum is the closest relative to mycobacteria of the tuberculosis complex and provides a powerful model to study the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in genetically tractable model organisms, such as Drosophila and zebrafish. The soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has become a popular experimental model to study the cell-autonomous innate immune response, because D. discoideum and human phagocytes share several conserved functions, such as engulfment killing and digestion of microorganisms by phagocytosis. Using D. discoideum a host, we identify and characterize mycobacterial and host factors that modulate resistance to infection and cell-to-cell spreading. We study bacteria sensing and killing and the role of NADPH-oxidases in ROS production. We study the specific roles of the three NOX isoforms in ROS production and susceptibility to mycobacteria infection. We also study the roles of three paralogs of the CD36 family of scavenger receptor type B. One is present at the surface and acts as a receptor, while the other two are lysosomal and are implicated in trafficking of hydrolases. Like M. tuberculosis in macrophages, M. marinum interferes with phagosome maturation by modulating membrane trafficking events to and from its compartment. We developed both quantitative-comparative proteomic techniques and live cell imaging with various probes of the phagolysosomal pathway to study the mechanisms of maturation arrest. In a final stage of infection, M. marinum and M. tuberculosis escape from their vacuole to the cytosol. We study the complex importance of a putative mycobacterial pore-forming toxin and of the autophagy pathway in the genesis, maintenance and breakage of that compartment. Overall, our studies demonstrate the conservation of both pathogen virulence strategies and host defence mechanisms, ensuring the success of D. discoideum as a powerful and simple host-pathogen model system to study mechanisms of mycobacterial infection. In that context, our most recent efforts are directed at using this alternative system to screen for small chemicals that interfere with the infection, either as anti-mycobacteria virulence or host immunity-boosting compounds.",

WNV is maintained in an enzootic cycle between birds and ornitho-philic mosquitoes, mainly Culex species, while humans, horses, and other mammals are considered incidental or dead-end hosts. Infection in humans mainly occurs asymptomatically or, in approximately 20% of cases, with a febrile illness, while, in <1% of infections, it occurs with a neuroinvasive disease, which is often severe or even lethal in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. First isolated in 1937 in the district of West Nile in Uganda, in the last 30 years the virus has been responsible for several human and equine outbreaks in Europe and in the Mediterranean basin. In recent years, epidemics caused by WNV in humans and horses have become more frequent in Southern European countries, such as Italy and Greece. The increasing number of WNV outbreaks is associated with the emergence of novel viral strains, which display higher virulence and greater epidemic potential for humans. In addition, both WNV lineage 1 and lineage 2 have been isolated in recent years in European countries. Recent research findings on WNV epidemiology, biology, vaccines and drugs under development will be presented.",

Most hantaviruses are rodent-borne, although several novel hantaviruses with unknown pathogenic potential have been identified in a variety of insectivores (shrews and a mole). Each hantavirus is primarily carried by a distinct rodent/insectivore species and is maintained by cyclical transmission between persistently infected rodents, with incidental infection of humans. Hantaviruses are found worldwide and are known to cause two serious and often fatal human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. The mortality rates vary from 12% in HFRS up to 50% in HCPS. Both diseases are acute febrile infections, usually acquired through inhalation of aerosols or dust particles contaminated with virus containing rodent excreta. HFRS is characterized by renal failure and hemorrhagic manifestations that vary from petechiae to severe internal bleeding. Pneumonia and cardiovascular dysfunction are characteristic of HCPS. Increased permeability of micro vascular endothelium seems to be a common effect of hantavirus infection. Although, the pathogenesis of hantavirus infection is poorly understood, it is suggested that not the direct viral cytopathology, but immune mechanisms may play an important role in a complex pathogenesis. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection is primarily based on serology, since viral RNA cannot be regularly detected in the blood or urine of patients. For immunization, inactivated virus vaccines are licensed in certain Asian countries. Moreover, several classical and molecular vaccine approaches are in pre-clinical stages of development. No specific therapy is used in Europe, although both Ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1 have been successfully used in trials in China. Both, the amplitude and the magnitude of hantavirus outbreaks have been increasing. The environmental changes may affect the geographic distribution, abundance, and the dynamic of the carrier rodent species, and thus the epidemiology of hantavirus disease. Hantaviruses and diseases that they cause deserve the attention of researchers, public health officials and increased clinician awareness with a regard to their impact on public health.",

Any antibiotic use selects for resistant bacteria and we use antibiotics extensively to treat and prevent infections in humans and animals; the sequelae impact also on the environment. Resistance is as old as antibiotic production, and many of the resistance genes that we recognize today evolved millennia ago. These genes have moved through bacterial ecosystems to genera in the environment and in animal (including human) hosts, and some eventually reach a species that causes infection and is subjected to susceptibility testing. Multi-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are one of the greatest challenges encountered by clinical microbiologists, and we have witnessed two waves since 2000. Broad usage of oxyimino-cephalosporins selected first for ESBL producers, particularly those with CTX-M enzymes and, to a lesser extent, bacteria with acquired AmpCs. These were countered by increasing use of carbapenems for serious infections, and in consequence we now face an international onslaught of Enterobacteriaceae that have acquired a diverse array of carbapenemases. These acquired beta-lactamases are usually encoded on plasmids that encode resistance to multiple other antibiotic classes. Genome sequencing reveals that these plasmids are built in modular fashion; a fundamental self-replicating backbone of essential genes then accumulates resistance genes through successive rounds of transposition and recombinational events. Plasmids can be considered \u201csuccessful\u201d if they are readily transmissible between bacterial strains, species or genera and/or if they are hosted by a successful bacterial strain or clone. Both scenarios have contributed to the global dissemination of ESBLs and carbapenemases, with exposure to antibiotics the most obvious and direct selective pressure. With few new antibiotics in development, preserving the efficacy of those we have must be a priority for all prescribers.",

LL-37 is a cationic polypeptide found in humans and is a key component of the innate immune system responsible for killing phagocytosed bacteria and immunoregulation. We assessed the susceptibility of S. aureus isolates causing BSI to killing by LL-37. Methods Ten S. aureus isolates causing complicated and ten causing uncomplicated BSI were randomly selected to assess their susceptibility to LL-37. Both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were included (n = 16 and n = 4). All isolates were positive for the multiple peptide resistant factor (mprF) gene which codes for lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) synthase except one causing complicated infection and one causing uncomplicated infection. Bactericidal activity was determined from viable cell counts following incubation of 5 \u00d7 10 5 CFU/mL S. aureus with 2.5 \u03bcg/mL LL-37 for 1 hour compared to assays containing no LL-37. Results The susceptibility to LL-37 among clinical S. aureus isolates was highly variable. Bactericidal activity of LL-37 towards S. aureus from uncomplicated BSI ranged from 0 to 75.8% (mean 32.4%) and for S. aureus from complicated BSI, ranged from 0 to 47.2% (mean 25.1%) p = 0.6305. MSSA isolates were more susceptible to LL-37 killing than MRSA isolates, range 0\u201375.76%, mean 31.06%, vs. range 0\u201342.06%, mean 19.55%, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2986). The absence of the mprF gene in two isolates did not appear to affect their susceptibility to LL-37, mean killing 14.9% and 4.37%, respectively. Conclusion The ability to evade the innate immune response may contribute to the development of complicated BSI. Isolates causing complicated infection were less susceptible to killing with LL-37 than those causing uncomplicated infection. MRSA isolates causing BSI were less susceptible to LL-37 than MSSA isolates. This supports previous findings. Reduced susceptibility to killing by LL-37 may contribute to the persistence of S. aureus in complicated BSI.",

Purified fresh and heated outer membrane vesicles of both N. meningitidis and N. lactamica demonstrated to contain the suppressive factor, being effective even at small concentrations and implying that the capsule is not the key factor either. Purification experiments have suggested that B-cells might be the cell type responsible of this phenomenon; however they seem to require other accessory cells from the PBMCs to achieve a regulatory phenotype. Latest experiments with E. coli and S. pneumoniae have clarified that such suppressive effect may be exhibited by bacteria other than N. meningitidis, but that the resultant inhibition is dose sensitive and varies among organisms.",

However, the scientific evidence for each of these strategies is conflicting. Well designed prospective studies are, therefore, necessary. Observational studies are hampered by bias by indication as the choice of therapy may be influenced by different determinants, such as severity of disease or the patients' overall prognosis. As a result, younger patients are more frequently treated with antibiotics with atypical coverage compared to older patients. Although it is \u2013 theoretically \u2013 possible to adjust for these differences in multivariate analysis, many determinants may be hidden which will result in (residual) confounding. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) avoid bias by indication, but may suffer from information bias. Individual randomisation in RCT's requires written informed consent from participating patients. Therefore, in most RCT's, patients have already started with antibiotic treatment before consent is obtained. As the initial antibiotic may differ from the antibiotic after randomization, and since initial treatment is crucial for outcome, such a design may severely compromise an accurate evaluation.",

McDowell* (Belfast, UK) Propionibacterium acnes is a Gram-positive aerotolerant anaerobe that is found predominately on the skin where it forms part of the resident microbiota. It represents the major opportunistic pathogen within the \u201ccutaneous\u201d group of propionibacteria and has been linked, sometimes controversially, to a range of infections and conditions. Historically, the role of P. acnes in certain infections has almost certainly been underestimated due to diagnostic protocols that have poor sensitivity for the detection of the bacterium combined with dismissal as a contaminant when it is recovered. Today, data emerging from P. acnes whole genome sequencing projects, phylogenetic and genetic population analyses, and studies at the transcriptome and proteome level are challenging our understanding of this bacterium and its capacity to cause disease. In particular, isolates from the four genetic divisions (IA, IB, II and III) of P. acnes differ with regard to inflammatory potential and the production of specific virulence determinants, including proteins with phase/antigenic variation signatures, CAMP factor homologues, haemolysins, and lipase. Recent studies have found a very clear association between isolates from the type IA division, including a globally dispersed clonal lineage, and acne vulgaris. In contrast, isolates from the type IB, II and III divisions are rarely associated with this condition, although they appear to be more frequently recovered from soft tissue and medical implant-related infections. In addition to a discussion of P. acnes epidemiology in relation to acne, we will consider recent data from studies investigating a possible link between P. acnes infection of the prostate gland and prostate cancer development, and review the growing body of evidence that supports P. acnes as an important pathogen in relation to biofilm infections of prosthetic joints.",

The Gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is ubiquitously found on the skin, where it resides within sebaceous follicles of the face and back. The presence of P. acnes is thought to be beneficial, e.g. protecting against colonization by harmful microorganisms. However, emerging evidence suggests that P. acnes can act as an opportunistic pathogen in a number of inflammatory diseases. Above all, the bacterium is well known for its association with acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease, which affects up to 80% of all adolescents. However, despite decades of research, the exact role of the bacterium in acne remains an enigma. Recent research has highlighted the potential importance of P. acnes strain identity for determining disease outcome of colonization. This assumption is based on the fact that there are disparities between acne isolates and strains isolated from healthy individuals. Moreover, strain identity seems to have a major impact on host tissue adhesion and inflammatory potential of P. acnes. We decided to apply comparative genome and transcriptome analysis to pinpoint the major differences between \u201ccommensal\u201d and \u201cdisease-associated\u201d strains of P. acnes. Our data highlight the presence of genomic regions and islands and their possible contributions to pathogenicity. Targeting strain-specific P. acnes factors is a novel therapeutic strategy to cure acne and other P. acnes -associated diseases, with the added advantage of minimal disturbance to the fragile balance of our skin microbiota.",

This fusion has caused an additional six amino acids to be added to the N-terminus of the pre-protein which explains its recently described ragged N-terminus by changing cleavage sites and also the membrane targeting of NDM-1. This fusion may have happened by two routes. Firstly a deletion event between an upstream aphA6 composite transposon could have occurred removing sequence upstream of the start codon and the majority of the aphA6 gene or secondly, this structure could have been constructed by an ISCR16-like element which initially captured blaNDM-1 and then moved it into the aphA6 gene. Analysis of sequence adjacent to the oriIS of the ISCR16/blaNDM-1 structures in both Acinetobacter and other species indicate that it has inserted in a region with a similar GC% to A. baumanii adding evidence to such an hypothesis. The construction of blaNDM-1 by this fusion event has also given blaNDM-1 new promoter sequences by a natural genetic engineering event which may be linked to its recent success. The identical sequence upstream blaNDM-1 and aphA6 genes indicates that the fusion is recent, in line with current knowledge of NDM-1 emergence.",

Among 11 pt who developed CMV infection without CMV disease they had received a pre-emptive therapy. Mean time to CMV infection in pt receiving and not receiving universal prophylaxis was 142 and 78 days, respectively.

Diseases outside the respiratory tract include bacteremia with no recognized focus, meningitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis and osteomyelitis. The complex polysaccharide capsule repels ingestion and killing by innate immune mechanisms or by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Peptidoglycan, the principal constituent of cell wall, and pneumolysin each stimulate an intense inflammatory response. Disease of the respiratory tract results when the host fails to clear organisms and inflammatory products accumulate. Treatment of extra-CNS infection has remained straightforward, with most pneumococci remaining susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics in commonly used doses and to fluoroquinolones. Even meningitis, in most cases, responds to commonly recommended high doses of third-generation cephalosporins. Some newer antibiotics such as ceftaroline appear to be effective against penicillin-resistant organisms. Widespread use of 7-valent PCV has led to emergence of replacement strains, and use of 13-valent PCV is almost certain to have the same effect, limiting the usefulness of any polysaccharide-based vaccine in the future.

Further research is needed to find a simple low-tech diagnosis, treatment for chronic lesions, and to explore the preventive effects of mass drug administration on symptoms, sandy patches, HPV and the HIV epidemic.",

WNV NAT screening of blood, tissue, and organ donation identified four WNV RNA-positive blood donors and one WNV RNA-positive organ donor, who were resident in the same areas where symptomatic human cases were identified. A WNV-positive organ donor was missed by NAT testing and transmitted infection to three out of five recipients, two of whom (the kidney recipients) developed WNND and excreted WNV RNA in their urine. Rapid detection of these cases allowed prevention of further transmissions to other tissue recipients. Following this experience, we monitored WNV RNA in the urine of WNV NAT-positive blood donors. In these subjects, WNV RNA remained positive in urine long after becoming undetectable in peripheral blood. Whole genome sequencing of two human WNV strains isolated in Veneto Region in 2011 demonstrated that they were WNV lineage 1, clade 1a, and phylogenetically related to WNV strains circulating in Italy and in the Western Mediterranean basin in the previous years. About 1% divergence was observed between the genome of the WNV strains isolated in 2011 and the strain isolated in 2009 in Veneto Region.",

OXA-48 beta-lactamase was initially identified in Turkey, but there have been scattered reports, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, from several countries in the Middle-East and the Mediterranean region, especially north Africa. Hospital outbreaks caused by producers of this carbapenemase have been described in Turkey and more recently in several European countries. K. pneumoniae strains of sequence type 395 have been implicated in the European spread of OXA-48 carbapenemase, although the resistance gene has been detected in many clones and, indeed, other genera. The blaOXA-48 gene is usually located on transposon Tn1999, which has been found in OXA-48-positive Enterobacteriaceae of diverse geographic origin on highly-related conjugative plasmids of c. 62-kb. A recently described variant, OXA-181 carbapenemase, differs from OXA-48 by just four amino acids, but its gene is associated with an ISEcp1 element on a distinct transposon, Tn2013, and on much smaller plasmids of c. 7-kb. Accurate detection of these enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae may pose problems for diagnostic and reference laboratories unless confirmatory molecular tests are used; many producers remain susceptible in vitro to imipenem and/or meropenem and, in the absence of other resistance mechanisms such as ESBLs, also to oxyimino-cephalosporins. Highlevel resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam and temocillin may be useful markers for OXA-48-like enzymes in strains that show reduced carbapenem susceptibility.

Voluntary surveillance, can provide data pre 2002, however, as a voluntary scheme, LabBase2 risk under-ascertainment, thus, MRSA rates calculated from the former are lower than those from the latter (Figure 1).

We used criteria established by the Centers for Control and Prevention to ascertain the diagnosis of DSWI. Time period specific incidence rates (in-hospital or within 30 days out of hospital) were calculated. A score-based predictive model for DSWI was developed from the logistic regression model using a regression coefficient\u2013based scoring method. To generate a simple integer-based point score for each predictor variable, scores were assigned by dividing beta coefficients by the absolute value of the smallest coefficient in the model and rounding to the nearest integer. The overall risk score was calculated by adding each component together. Discrimination of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC).

We are in the process of implementing full microbiology laboratory automation to provide timely information relevant for patient care. So far, the majority of processes are controlled by a laboratory information system (LIS) that is also transmitting the results to the hospital information system (HIS). At present, urgent results, such as the identification of bacteria causing bloodstream infections or the antimicrobial susceptibility data of multi-resistant pathogens are communicated via phone by clinical microbiologists, which also regularly participate on clinical rounds to discuss critical patients. However, the mere number of hospitals and there geographic distribution makes direct communication ever more difficult. We are, hence, forced to apply new information technology to collect clinical data required both for prioritizing tests and for interpreting test results. This requires an intelligent, versatile and open middle ware that not only controls the lab organization but also communicates with existing laboratory or clinical information systems without compromising data safety and security or strangling the capacity of exiting IT divisions. The use of smartphones or other personal digital assistants over wireless broadband or 3G networks represents a promising way for real-time clinical alerts with or without decision support both for antimicrobial therapy or hospital hygiene.

            "text": "Isolation as a mean to control the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms is subject to controversy. Isolation makes sense if a bacteria is efficaciously transmitted by direct contact, and patients (or their surrounding surfaces) harbouring them are important reservoirs. In a recent systematic review of published articles, multifaceted strategies including contact precautions and isolation has been shown to be associated with increased probability of controlling the spread of MDR gram negatives. However, because isolation may be associated with adverse effects, pros and cons should be carefully considered. Many clonal outbreaks of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in which colonised patients are key reservoirs have been described. Moreover, some clones of K. pneumoniae are well known by their great ability to spread by cross-transmission within healthcare centres. This usual epidemiologic behaviour makes it prudent to recommend isolation for all patients colonised or infected with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. This recommendation may be applied to other species of Klebsiella and Enterobacter. The decision is more difficult in the case of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. Two arguments can be used to recommend isolation in these cases: the fact that some ESBL-producing E. coli has been shown to spread clonally, and the fact that the mobile genetic elements associated with ESBLs may be cross-transmitted using E. coli or other enterobacteria as a vehicle. However, clonal spread of E. coli actually occurs in the community, and whether acute care centers plays a relevant role in further amplifying the spread is far from clear. Well proven nosocomial outbreaks caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in which cross-transmission is important are scarce and usually affected small numbers of patients. Finally, the prevalence of colonisation with ESBL-producing E. coli in the community in many areas may be too high to feasibly detect and isolate all them. Thus, combining activities aimed at improving hand hygiene and prudent use of antibiotics which select for these organisms (mainly, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones) while carefully tracking all nosocomial cases so that any outbreak can be readily detected is a reasonable alternative to isolation for all pateints harbouring ESBL-producing E. coli. An exception to this might be patients admitted to ICUs, for which isolation may be prudent.",

Because MALDI-TOF MS is capable of detecting a broad spectrum of molecules, including structural modifications at the molecular level, the detection of different mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobials may soon become available. Two main approaches can be used for this purpose: (i) the identification of molecular epidemiological markers specific to drug-resistant cells and (ii) the detection of the destruction or modification of antibiotic molecules. The former approach has been used for the detection of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and for the elucidation of polymyxin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria resulting from structural changes in their lipopolysaccharides. The latter approach was first applied for detecting the modification of beta-lactams by beta-lactamases. Methods for the detection of carbapenemases based on the hydrolysis of meropenem or ertapenem were recently validated. MALDI-TOF MS was able to detect small changes in carbapenem molecules (e.g., sodium salt variant of these antibiotics). Therefore, it can be hypothesised that assays for the detection of modifications of other antibiotic molecules (e.g., aminoglycosides) can be rapidly developed. The greatest challenge in determining the mechanisms of drug resistance is the quantification of antibiotic concentrations. In general, the quantification of molecules using MALDI-TOF MS may be difficult but is possible. This method could be helpful in the study of efflux and porins. I believe that MALDI-TOF MS can provide many new applications that will be applicable not only in research on drug resistance mechanisms but also the development of routine microbiological diagnostics.",

Analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for this purpose is rapid and economic, the resulting spectra can be very informative. These extraordinary features for the identification of bacteria have lead to the extension of the approach for the characterisation of other microorganisms like yeasts or fungi, and also of tissue cultures and whole animals, especially arthropods. The interest of many users focuses on the question of how detailed MALDI-typing can be at best. Concerning bacteria, it is of greatest interest to which taxonomic level samples can be classified and, in a number of cases, if biovars or serotypes can be reliably distinguished. In contrast to the identification of proteins or peptides by mass spectrometry, the identification of the analyte by MALDI-typing is not based on the comparison of the experimental spectrum with masses calculated from a sequence database but rather on the comparison of the analyte spectrum with a library of reference spectra from authentic samples. Although widely applied, some theoretical aspects of mass spectrum-based classification have not been fully addressed yet. A number of commercial and in-house softwares implementing different classification algorithms are in use, complicating cross-platform comparison of typing results. One step in most algorithms used for classification is data reduction, i.e. the selection of masses from the reference or sample spectra that are useful for classification. This is especially necessary for the distinction of closely related organisms like subspecies or serotypes, as their spectra will only present a limited number of differing masses. In an effort to characterise the spatial and temporal distribution of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates representing the serotypes O165:H25, O26:H11/H32, and O156:H25, we have analysed MALDI-type spectra by systematic variation of the data reduction step in our classification algorithm. With optimised parameters, the classification of all three O-serotypes was possible with a false rate below 1%. For all combinations of two of the three groups, parameters could be adjusted to accurately distinguish the two groups.",

As terminal differentiation is associated with compromised effector functions, impairment of T^regs might contribute to persistent immune activation which in turn leads to a higher frequency of CD7- cells within the CD4+ T cells lacking the ability of adequate proliferation in order to reconstitute T cell loss. Upon stimulation those T cell subsets accumulate that show compromised IL-2 secretion capacities (CD7-) as well as those unable to home (CCR7-) into secondary lymphoid organs like T^EM cells. As IL2 is an essential growth factor for T^eff and T^reg cells, low IL-2 levels might explain persistent CD4 cell depletion as well as chronic immune stimulation in InRs.",

Patients with positive CSF VDRL had significantly lower CD4 counts (143 vs. 526, p = 0.004), RPR serum titres >1/32(p = 0.015), lower CD4 nadir(p = 0.030), CNS symptoms(p = 0.05) and HIV diagnosis a propos positive syphilis serology(p = 0.032). CSF cell count >10 was more common in patients with HIV infection diagnosed due to syphilis serology(p = 0.003), younger age(30 vs. 38 years, p = 0.014), lower CD4 count (370 vs. 538, p = 0.044), higher logVL (4.1 vs. 2.6, p = 0.004) and in treatment-naive patients (p = 0.05).

Assessment of treatment efficacy is difficult because it is affected by the phase of CD, dose, length of treatment, and the end-points evaluated in clinical studies. Trypanocidal treatment has proven to be efficacious in acute, congenital, early chronic infections (children under 18) and reactivations, while its usefulness is much more doubtful in patients with late chronic disease, and probably has no role in advanced organ involvement. As for treatment monitorization serology is the most reliable test for cure. However, while in children serology negativization can take 3\u20136 years after therapy, in adults with chronic CD this may take up to 10\u201320 years.

First, BSIs are associated with important morbidity and mortality, and the incidence of BSI has been increasing during last decades. Second, indications for performing blood cultures are similar in most hospitals, and etiologic diagnosis is available by definition, and making BSI a good model for observational investigation on the clinical impact of antibiotic resistance and of antimicrobial treatment. Third, some aspects of the clinical management are common among all patients with BSI. And fourth, programs aimed at improving the earlier adequate management of BSI have been shown to improve outcomes. We have recently proposed some indicators of structure, processes, and outcome that might be useful to evaluate the quality of care for patients with BSI. Although some available data may be used for preliminary benchmarking, more studies are needed. Additionally, data on BSI may serve as indicators for evaluating other programs, such as those directed to improving the management of sepsis, or local protocols for antimicrobial use. The implementation of activities aimed at improving the management and outcome of patients with BSI should be a priority for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology services in all hospitals. Such activities should ideally be performed in collaboration by well-trained microbiologists and infectologists under a structured program including early reporting of preliminary and definitive results, active offering for specialised clinical management advice and follow-up, educational activities, and feed-back.",

Complex mechanisms enable these pathogens to exchange genetic information, especially the distribution of resistance determinants leads to their propensity to cause hospital outbreaks as well as endemic spread. Here, we report that one of the very factors responsible for genetic exchange, namely a specific protein of the so-called type four secretion systems, represents an Achilles heel that can be harnessed to fight these often untreatable infections. A prototypical gram-positive type four secretion system is present on plasmid pIP501, and several proteins of the transfer region have been expressed in E. coli. Rabbit sera were raised against two proteins, i.e. ORF10 and ORF13, that code for an ATPase and a putative channel component. The rabbit sera were used in an opsonophagocytic assay and sera raised against ORF13 showed 77% killing of the homologous strain at a dilution of 1:10. Using absorption of the sera with increasing amounts of purified protein this killing could be inhibited by up to 44.5%. Testing of a larger collection of strains from different species revealed that 3/4 (75%) E. faecalis, 2/4 (50%) E. faecium, and 5/5 (100%) S. aureus were effectively killed by anti-ORF13 at a dilution of 1:10, including one vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strain and several USA300 CA-MRSA. Western Blot analysis demonstrated cross-reactive protein bands in two of three tested E. faecalis-, three of four E. faecium and a total of five S. aureus strains, respectively. The homologous strain E. faecalis JH2-2pIP501 (expressing protein Orf13) shows a band at 37.5 kDa. Using a mouse bacteremia model, significant reductions in colony counts were seen in animals that had received anti-ORF13 as compared to animals that had received antisera against ORF10 and were challenged with the homologous E. faecalis, as well as with an E. faecium and a CA-MRSA strain. Animals infected with the homologous E. faecalis that were not carrying plasmid pIP501 were not protected. These data demonstrate that ORF13 is the target of opsonic and protective antibodies and may therefore be a promising and broadly cross-protective vaccine candidate targeting multi-resistant gram-positive pathogens.",

CDI patients tended to be older in E (median age 67 years) than in NA (61 years; p < 0.05), were more likely to receive concomitant antibiotics for other infections in E (35%) than in NA (27%; p < 0.05), were more often treated as inpatients (84% in E vs. 58% in NA; p < 0.05). Fidaxomicin was non-inferior to vancomycin for clinical cure (mITT: 87.7% vs. 86.8%; difference 0.9, lower 97.5% CL, -4.9) and superior to vancomycin for recurrence (12.7% vs. 26.9%, p < 0.001) and sustained response (76.6% vs. 63.4%, p = 0.001). In NA, 46% of isolates belonged to the BI group (also known as NAP1 and 027), followed by Y (10%), G (7%), and J (4%). In Europ e, the most prevalent strains were Y (16%), J (15%), BI (10%), G (8%), and BK (7%). Susceptibilities were similar in E and NA to fidaxomicin (MIC90 = 0.25 \u03bcg/mL), vancomycin (MIC90 = 0.5 \u03bcg/mL), and metronidazole (MIC90 = 1 \u03bcg/mL).",
