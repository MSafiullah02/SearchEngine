            "text": "To the Editor\u2014In December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and has now spread worldwide.1 Currently, the diagnostic gold standard is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). From the sensitivity perspective, sputum samples are preferable for examination.2 If acquiring a sputum sample is difficult, a healthcare worker (HCW) can collect sample from the nasopharynx.3 Getting a sample from the nasopharynx may carry a risk of the patient sneezing or coughing, and the HCW could be potentially exposed to the virus. Therefore, HCWs are required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for each examination and procedure. However, PPE is difficult to don and doff, and donning and doffing carries the risk of infection. Furthermore, if the demand for RT-PCR increases under conditions in which medical resources are scarce, it might be difficult to sample and test all specimens.",
