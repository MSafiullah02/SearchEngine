Here, I investigate the demographics of astronomical transients and supernova classifications reported to the Transient Name Server in the year 2019. I find that only a tenth of the transients were spectrally classified. This severe \"bottleneck\" problem should concern astronomers and also funding agencies, especially LSST will make the situation worse by a factor of 20 (or more). We need to fundamentally rethink the purpose of surveys for transients. Here, after undertaking a detailed investigation of this issue I offer some solutions. Going forward, astronomers will employ two different methodologies: (1) multi-band photometric method which is well suited to the study of very large, many tens of thousands, samples of faint transients; (2) spectral classifications of thousands of bright transients found in shallow and nightly cadenced wide-field photometry surveys and transients associated with galaxies in the local Universe. The latter program, in addition to unearthing new types of transients and offering astronomers opportunities to undertake extensive follow up of interesting transients, is needed to set the stage for the former. Specifically, I suggest a globally coordinated effort to spectrally classify a complete sample of bright supernovae ( 19.5 mag) and transients within the local Universe (< 200 Mpc). The proposed program is within reach -thanks to the on-going wide-field surveys, the development of novel spectrographs tuned for classification, great improvements in throughput of spectrographs and the increasing availability of robotic telescopes.",

The latter culminated with the discovery, through the light curves of SNe of type Ia and the redshifts of the host galaxies, of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. The systematic study of cosmological SNe is one of the principal goals of the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory 1 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) space mission. Zwicky (1974) provides a very readable summary of supernova searches, starting from the Palomar 18-inch program and going through the sixties (and including the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt-camera telescope now renamed as the Oschin Telescope). Early attempts at moving away from the photographic plate and manually operated telescopes are summarized by Colgate et al. (1975) . In my view, any serious student of SN searches should read these two classic papers. Many of the ideas mentioned in these two papers are still valid today.",

LOSS targeted bright galaxies in the local Universe and, at its peak, was discovering about one hundred SNe per year. R. Quimby, for his thesis, used a 45-cm telescope with the then large fieldof-view of 3.4 deg 2 to search for SNe towards clusters of galaxies and found the first two members of a new class of extragalactic transients -super-luminous supernovae (Quimby 2006) . The All Sky Automated Survey-Supernova survey (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014) , initiated circa 2012, continued the tradition of looking for bright SNe but by undertaking a systematic search of the entire night sky (\"blind\" or \"un-targeted\" searches). For these three projects, the discovery rate was modest enough (few hundred per year) that members of the observing team visually inspected candidate events and announced highly reliable candidates. The candidates were bright enough ( 18 mag) that spectral classification of the candidates could be readily undertaken by the global SN community.",

The increase in the transient detection rate has not been accompanied by corresponding increase in spectral classification. In fact, most of the transient candidates \"die on the floor\". Stated bluntly, transient object astronomy field has already undergone a profound shift -from a relatively event-poor field to an event-drowning field. In view of this fundamental change in \u00a73 I try to understand what constitutes meaningful discovery in the field optical transients. In \u00a74 I present a quantitative analysis of \"Astronomical Transients\" (ATs) and SNe reported to the Transient Name Server (TNS) 3 in the year 2019. The bottleneck factor -the ratio of reported ATs to spectrally classified transients -now stands at 10. This factor is expected to increase over time. This bottleneck not withstanding, I revisit the fundamental importance of spectral classification and determination of redshifts of transient events ( \u00a75). In \u00a76 I suggest an integrated \"Optical Transient Utility\" consisting of an imaging element and spectral classification element. The two elements together provide, routinely, nightly cadenced light curves of the sky accompanied by spectral classification of all bright transients. In \u00a77, I summarize the principal conclusions and then follow it up with some observations on the importance of clearing houses and astroinformatics.",

Second, I note that over the course of the mission lifetime, Swift now essentially acts like \"GRB Utility 8 \"a reliable source of usable products (time of explosion, arcsecond position and early afterglow light curves). In a fundamental way, this transformation is a direct indicator of the maturity of the field. After having studied over several thousand GRBs, even an astronomer who is devoted to GRBs would not be willing to chase every GRB. Instead, astronomers review the Swift data products and define sub-samples that are worthy of further study.

Thus the SEDM with R \u2248 100 trades spectral resolution for telescope aperture (see \u00a7C for details). It is for this reason that the SEDM mounted on a mere (but dedicated) 60-inch Note-ns (column 2) is the number of spectra observed with the telescopespectrograph (column 1) whereas column 3 is the ratio of ns to the total number of classification and expressed as a percentage.

So the path to all other transients, especially the rare transients, requires a masterful understanding of SNe, if only to eliminate them in the quest for, say, kilonovae. Minkowski (1941) introduced classification based on spectroscopy. The initial classification was type I (Hydrogen absent) and type II (Hydrogen present). Over time, spectral sub-types (Ib,Ic, IIn) and light curve based subtypes (IIL, IIP) were introduced (see Filippenko 1997). For completeness, at the suggestion of my colleague, Anders Nyholm, I mention the pioneering work of Piotr Kulikovsky (1910 Kulikovsky ( -2003 a classification system also based on light curves (Kulikovsky 1944; see Litvinova & Nadezhin 1983 for a modern citation). This system distinguished between four types of supernovae and found that some classes of supernovae favored star-forming galaxies and others latetype galaxies. I offer the following ansatz: about one hundred data points are needed to make a fairly secure classification. These points could either be a low resolution optical spectrum or a multi-band light curve with tens of epochs properly sampled. 14 However, in either case we need to know the redshift of the transient. A spectrum of the transient will not only provide a robust classification 15 but also readily result in the redshift of the transient (or the host). For high redshift transients, say z 0.3, multi-band photometry of the host galaxy will be adequate to get a useful estimate of the redshift (Collister & Lahav 2004) and thus set the energy scale.",

As a flagship survey, LSST has to respond to many constituencies. The resulting slow cadence of LSST is well suited for the study of slowly varying transients (such as SLSN) including cosmological Ia supernovae, lensed supernovae, thanks to the time dilation factor of 1 + z. There are plans to set aside a small amount of time for moderate to high cadence studies of selected fields. Given the high density of faint events, such \"mini\" surveys are well suited to explore the phase space of faint and fast events. In particular, with these mini-surveys, LSST, because of its depth, is well positioned to undertake a comprehensive investigation of relativistic stellar explosions and related phenomenon (especially orphan afterglows). 15 For obdurate sources, a repeat spectrum usually clarifies. 16 In fact, the Transients and Variable Stars science working group of LSST has initiated a major program to precisely address this issue: Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTICC); see https://plasticc.org. 17 Given the delays due to COVID-19, a plausible schedule for full operations, including routine real-time release of alerts, of the Rubin Observatory is early 2024.",

In the same way, in the LSST era, we need to have wide-field nightly cadenced sky survey(s) to operate in conjunction with LSST. Accepting this conclusion and motivated by the success of Swift \"GRB Utility\" ( \u00a73.1) I propose an integrated \"Optical Transient Utility\".

The resulting data will be complementary to LSST and, equally importantly, produce the foundational data for Machine Learning algorithms which can then be applied to large samples of faint transients with modest number of photometric points.

If this thesis is accepted then astronomers would be well served with a major clearing house for variable stars which, for the arguments presented throughout this paper, should also include eruptive stars.",

The current filter, like the previous one, requires that sources be above the reference level and above 19.0 mag, that they be detected in two or more epochs separated in time by at least 30 minutes, and that they be outside the Galactic plane (|b| > 7 \u2022 ).

Gaia Gaia Science Alerts system 28 (Wyrzykowski et al. 2012; Hodgkin et al. 2013 ) is a part of the European Space Agency's Gaia space mission (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) and is operated by the Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge, UK, with the support of researchers from the University of Warsaw, Poland, SRON, NL and Konkoly, Hungary. Gaia, which has been operational since 2014, covers about 1000 deg 2 over 24 hours and its data is transmitted to the ground on average every day. The typical delay between an observation and an alert is about 24-48 hours and typical cadence is 106 mins (due to the two mirror geometry of the instrument) and 30 days (due to scanning pattern). Alerts are defined as significant changes as measured by Gaia photometers (G-band; broad band optical). In the first two years of operation, Gaia Alerts delivered on average 1 alert per day, while now the rate is more than 10 transients/day. The detection pipeline is unbiased and is sensitive to both new sources (e.g., supernovae, cataclysmic variables) and old sources (e.g., micro-lensing events, AGN flares).",

The focus of ALeRCE is to enable fast follow up of young SNe and as such classification is undertaken even if there is only one observation.High-value candidates are automatically displayed at the \"SNhunter\" site 24 , only seconds after being ingested from the ZTF alert stream. After the end of night in California, three people (\"checkers\") visually inspect the top one hundred SN candidates. The following events are registered to TNS: events which are near-extended sources (putative host galaxies) and which have a PSF-like shape (based on the ZTF stamps and reference PS-1 images at the location of the candidate); which are not near known solar system objects; and, finally, which have not been vetoed by any of the checkers.NED, Simbad and SDSS are queried to review host galaxy properties (including redshift, if available). A lower limit for the magnitude rise rate is computed and reported if the rate exceeds 0.05 mag/day. Using these tools the group detected three SN candidates rising faster than one mag/day: ZTF19abueupg 25 , ZTF19abvdgqo 26 , ZTF20aaelulu 27 which were later classified as type II, Ib and Ic SNe, respectively. Between August 2018 and January 2020 the group has reported 1846 SN candidates with an average rate of 9.1 SNe/day. About two-third of them have shown a subsequent detection, while one third show just the first detection due to either being a very distant SNe near peak, an asteroid near an extended source, or a bogus candidates mistaken to be real. Over this period, a total 257 of the SN candidates reported to TNS have been spectroscopically classified by other groups.",

One of the applications has been to perform a selection of likely extragalactic transients from the ZTF alert stream and share these with the community through the TNS. The selection methodology was designed to simultaneously be reproducible, of high quality and have the capability to submit candidates in real-time to allow for fast follow-up. These goals were achieved through a fully automated selection process based on both alert properties and matches with static astronomical catalogs. As no human input is needed, the results carry no unknown selection biases and submission takes place within minutes of the initial ZTF observations. The selection quality, including false-positive and completeness rates, were examined through comparisons with data collected over the first months of ZTF operations (see Nordin et al. 2019 for a full account).Currently, two AMPEL TNS senders are active: ZTF AMPEL NEW only submits candidates with an age less than five days at the time of submission, thus catering to observers looking for quickly varying transients. ZTF AMPEL COMPLETEhas no age criteria and is instead designed to create a complete, pure candidate stream but Note-Column 2 is the number of unclassified bright (< 17.5 mag) ATs reported by group (Column 1).
