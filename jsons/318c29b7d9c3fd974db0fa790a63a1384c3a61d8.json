Greater emphasis was not only placed on the protection of health-care workers who have direct contact with NICP patients from the departments of infections, respiration, ICU and fever clinic, but also the protection of those from the department of skin and mucous membrane barrier, especially from the departments of stomatology, ophthalmology, digestive tract and endoscopy. We stressed the standards of wearing PPE (personal protective equipment), including protective masks and goggles in order to avoid the tragedy that three ophthalmologists from a hospital in Hubei Province died after being infected inside the hospital. Third, we carried out protection training for all medical workers on a regular basis, including wearing and taking off face masks and protective appliances, hand hygiene, how to enter the potential contaminated area from the contaminated area and then to the clean area, strengthening the training of hospital-acquired infection control knowledge, awareness of prevention and control. Fourth, we placed great importance in the health of medical workers and thus adjusted the working mode during the outbreak, especially when there were a large number of fever patients and a great deal of work. The fever clinic adopted a 4-6 hour shift of rotation so that doctors in the fever clinic can have meals on time, go to the toilet in time and take adequate rest. Meantime, we guaranteed sufficient nutrition for meals so as to avoid decreased resistance due to disordered life pattern and overwork and, reduce the risk of infection. Moreover, we conducted body temperature monitoring and epidemiologic history investigation on all staff. Those with abnormal body temperature will be conducted with oropharyngeal swab and RT-PCR test in time.",

Fifth, once a case in our hospital was confirmed, we carried out an epidemiological investigation on all close contacts, such as medical staff, workers and patients to make clear whether they have been infected. Oropharyngeal swab collection and RT-PCR [4] and a two-week mandatory quarantine were also required. Sixth, oropharyngeal RT-PCR were performed on all inpatients and newly admitted patients. We paid special attention to patients screening with epidemiological history, fever and respiratory symptoms. We integrated the ward resources and ensure single-room isolation for all inpatients. Despite the lack of supplies, it was guaranteed that patients wore masks and washed hands thoroughly and carefully. Seventh, suspended general outpatient services such as stomatology, E.N.T. and rescheduled operation to reduce potential risk of virus spread, and only emergency calls and surgery were maintained. Eighth, suspended selective operations and integrate wards. In two days, we established an isolated contagious area which includes a 60-bed fever observation ward and 120-bed inpatient ward. Last, we actively responded to the call of local government by quickly arranging 90 medical staffs to conduct a door-to-door epidemiological survey and throat swab collection for the residents with potential risk history. Totally, we have collected epidemiological data of 9,500 people and 7,732 throat swab specimens, which greatly reduce community transmission of asymptomatic patients.",
