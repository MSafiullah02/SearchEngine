The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.",

It is expected that, with the strict social distancing applications, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is going to be stabilized or sustained at several geographies [1] . However, second wave epidemics and resurgences are highly likely to occur [2] . Moreover, different geographies, due to segregation by administrative borders, asynchronously experience epidemic growths. While social distancing and quarantine measures have been the primary factor to contain SARS-CoV-2, widespread testing and aggressive contact tracing are observed to be effective to isolate the spreaders from vulnerable populations. According to this, widespread scanning of populations or subpopulations is crucial to locate and isolate epidemic clusters, especially by detecting asymptomatic carriers. Excessive numbers of asymptomatic carriers appear to be especially important as they might be the most important factor in the difficulty of lowering the reproductive numbers. An unbiased estimation of the ratio of asymptomatic or presymptomatic spreaders might be difficult to assess. Yet, statistics from small or medium sized cohorts and case studies indicate that they might be as abundant as 10%-50% [3] [4] . These ratios possess special importance regarding the case studies observing that asymptomatic/presymptomatic carriers are likely to infect their contacts [5] [6] .",

In general, group testing algorithms seek for T = O(k log n) measurements in order to correctly detect k positive cases in n testing samples. Practical algorithms are shown to achieve T \u2248 2.72 \u03b1 1\u2212\u03b1 ln n k while k scales sublinearly as k = \u03b8(n \u03b1 ) [9] .

[10] recently proposed an adaptive scheme, pooling rows and columns of PCR well-plates, and they showed that up to 10X efficiency gain could be achieved in 0.1%-5% prevalence band. While this is a very practical and a simple scheme eliminating the requirements of robotic pipetting needs and reducing the pipetting errors, more sophisticated pooling schemes that can improve the efficiency gains are available. Indeed, Shental et al. [11] used sampling 48 pools out of 384 well-plate by Reed-Solomon coding, and showed 8X efficiency gain around the band of 1% prevalence. These schemes offer very significant scale-ups in testing capacity, especially around mid-scale sparsity bands (i.e. 1%-5% prevalence). However, in potential scenarios of achieving wide-spread or community level scans with lower expected prevalence, further efficiency gains would be required. Therefore, designing group testing schemes aiming sparsity is beneficial to explore the practical capabilities.",

A widespread scanning concept might be focusing on determining the hot-spots within a population rather than diagnosing each individual for COVID-19. In such a case, test accuracy could be traded off in return of gains in testing capacity. Since single-pass group testing schemes are underdetermined systems analogous to compressed sensing, reduction in number of pools to be tested will translate to reduction in testing accuracy, which corresponds to the trade-off operation between efficiency gain and test accuracy. To observe this characteristics we conducted the simulations in similar prevalence ranges as the two-pass process. However, in this case random pools were decoded to sample test results in single pass using sCOMP decoding as described in the methods section. The accuracy increase was recorded with respect to increasing number of random pools at each prevalence instance. Starting from the same setting with two-pass testing pooling scheme, new pooling procedures were sampled at each pooling expansion. the parameter k, that corresponds to the contribution of a sample to the number of pools were incremented by one by the introduction of every 10 new pools.",

Asymptomatic cases, being the possible silent culprits of undetected infection clusters, are off the radar of conventional testing procedures. In order to expand the radius of contact tracing to subpopulation scan level or performing community scans, given the current testing infrastructures and resources efficient group testing strategies are needed. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes.

The proposed group testing, along with the other approaches reviewed previously, would not be helpful in the diagnostic use for symptomatic cases around outbreak peaks, for instance when the prevalence in a tested population is greater than 10%. On the other hand, a few cases at the early phases of an outbreak are worth to detect, as they might be the seeds for exponential growth of epidemic curves. Widespread testing for early detection of emerging clusters, therefore might be a powerful preventive approach. Our results claim that random pooling might be a preferable group testing strategy in similar scenarios. Another use case might be scanning for asymptomatic cases, separate from diagnostic testing on symptomatic individuals. This might be either as extending contact tracing to be able to test greater number of case contacts, or as a periodic scan of a population (e.g. healthcare workers and other risk groups). In case of community scans in which individual-level sensitivity can be sacrificed in return of spanning larger populations, single-pass group tests might also be useful. We have observed that for single-pass group testing, a small decrease in sensitivity could enable large efficiency gains at low prevalence groups. Such a high-throughput group testing on relatively large populations could be devised as a tool of locating infection hot spots.",

We ran simulations to investigate what should be the initial prevalence for such an expansion opportunity, and how many folds of extension would be available in the proposed group testing scheme.

The pooling size in our simulations does not exceed the experimented limits, so we believe proposed pooling schemes should act similarly in practical settings. Our second assumption is that the molecular tests are accurate enough to detect the samples without errors. Therefore, all simulations are performed for a noiseless scenario. While the actual picture might not comply with this assumption, the experiments ran with P-BEST approach indicate that imperfection of RT-qPCR tests does not have a negative effect on group testing. In fact, the encoding procedures of mixing matrices might even work as error correcting codes for low prevalence.

Any testing scheme preserving positivity as well as lack of signals in the absence of positives while combining samples in pools can be trivially integrated to group testing approaches. IgC/IgM based serological tests or any prospective test strategies (e.g. CRISPR-Cas12 based testing [15] ) should be considered for large scale testing/scanning with group testing under appropriate circumstances. It should be noted that the current concept of group testing relies on recovering the actual sample profile from binary outcomes of pooled tests. Testing schemes allowing quantitative outputs might be possible and further quantitative information might enable unprecedented efficiency gains. This opportunity can be hypothesized following the results of compressed sensing literature. For example, for the case of Sudocodes [16] , at a prevalence of 0.1%, 1 Million subjects can be scanned by performing under 10.000 tests even with perfect recovery [36] . Of course, this requires very precise quantitative and unique measures for each test subject. It might be a promising research direction to investigate such testing options. For example, shallow shotgun sequencing allowing positive signals while pronouncing specific sequences belonging to each sample could be a candidate for ultra-high throughput group testing. Proposed group testing algorithms assume and simulate under the circumstances that each sampled instance is independent. On the contrary, we know that COVID-19 sampling is mainly conducted on populations with social contacts, violating the independence assumptions. Sophisticated decoding algorithms informed by metadata might perform superior, allowing greater efficiency gains, while complicating the overall testing procedure in practice. Nevertheless, we believe that even in primitive forms group testing is a promising direction for efficient allocation of testing resources that should be considered for practical use.",

Clearly, the solutions are not unique, and in case several linear combinations cover the same support set of pools, the decoding is vulnerable to errors. Lowering the number of random pools drives the system to be more underdetermined, expecting greater number of errors on average. This can be observed from our simulations. When we observe the empirical results, the specificity has never been experienced to be lower than 0.97, which is expected since the negative/positive distribution is unbalanced. This is also an indication that the decoding is not overexploring the positives.

It should be noted that each efficiency gain requires different random pooling numbers for different prevalence regimes and a correct guess of prevalence should be predicted beforehand. In case prevalence distribution attains high variance, two-pass testing might be a safer approach.
