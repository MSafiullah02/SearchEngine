As the virus becomes more prevalent and resources become of more paramount importance, the option for surgery becomes much more limited. Under these conditions, injuries in which immediate surgical intervention would prevent significant impairment of function should be considered, including compartment syndromes, open fracture and irreducible joint dislocations, septic joints, abscesses and amputation/subamputation with devascularization of upper extremity segments. Among replantations, thumb amputation, multiple amputated fingers, pediatric amputations and proximal amputations of the dominant/non-dominant hand should still be considered absolute indications.74 Replantation of individual digits distal to the insertion of the flexor digitorum superficialis and ring avulsion injuries are relative indications and pros and cons of surgery should be discussed with the patient.",
