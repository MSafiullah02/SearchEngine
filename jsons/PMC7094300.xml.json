            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been implicated in more than 8000 cases and 900 related deaths since 2003. A coronavirus was identified as the major cause of SARS [1, 2]. The genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a positive\u2010stranded RNA virus, has been sequenced [3, 4]. The SARS coronavirus replicase gene contains two overlapping translation products, polyprotein 1a (\u223c450 kDa) and polyprotein 1ab (\u223c750 kDa). The polyproteins are cleaved by virus\u2010coded proteinases, one of which is the 3C\u2010like or SARS CoV main proteinase, a cysteine proteinase with a chymotrypsin\u2010like fold [5]. Prevention of the proteolytic processing of coronavirus replicase polyproteins inhibits the production of infectious virus particles [6], and for this reason the SARS CoV main proteinase is an attractive target for antiviral agents. However, before potential inhibitors can be screened, a sensitive and quantitative assay for enzyme activity must be developed.",

Upon cleavage by an endoproteinase of one of the two amide bonds adjacent to the Rhodamine moiety, the Rhodamine moiety in the resultant mono\u2010substituted product switches to the quinone state exhibiting a high degree of conjugation; concomitant with this is a massive increase in fluorescence intensity. Rhodamine\u2010based substrates have been used to assay caspases in vitro [12] and in vivo; trypsin, plasmin and thrombin [8]; leucine aminopeptidase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase in solution [13] and on the cell surface [14]; cathepsin K in vivo expressed in CHO cells [15]; elastase [16]; and the adenovirus proteinase [10, 11].",

We also cloned the gene for the SARS CoV main proteinase, expressed the gene in Escherichia coli without purification tags, and purified the enzyme.

The bis\u2010amide substrate does not absorb in the visible range as the Rhodamine moiety is in the lactone state. Upon cleavage of (Ala\u2010Arg\u2010Leu\u2010Gln\u2010NH)2\u2010Rhodamine by the SARS CoV main proteinase, the mono\u2010amide product (Ala\u2010Arg\u2010Leu\u2010Gln\u2010NH)\u2010Rhodamine is formed. The mono\u2010substituted product absorbs around 490 nm, because the Rhodamine\u2010moiety is in the quinone state. Ala\u2010Arg\u2010Leu\u2010Gln\u2010NH\u2010Rhodamine exhibits two, overlapping absorbance peaks with maxima at 469 and 492 nm, whereas Rhodamine 110 has a single absorbance peak at 496 nm. One interpretation for the origin of the split peak in the mono\u2010substituted product is: The bis\u2010substituted substrate is not symmetrical; cleavage of one bond on (Ala\u2010Arg\u2010Leu\u2010Gln\u2010NH)2\u2010Rhodamine may give rise to a species that absorbs slightly differently than if cleavage occurred at the other amide bond.",

The gene was ligated into pET11d plasmid and the resultant plasmid electroporated into TOP10 cells for propagation. Finally, the pET11d\u2010SARS plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. For expression, the BL21(DE3) cells were grown overnight in autoinduction medium [20]. A large amount of the enzyme appeared in the supernatant after centrifugation of the cell lysate, Fig. 2\n. The soluble proteinase in the supernatant flowed through a strong cation column connected in series to a strong anion column. The last step in the purification procedure was to apply that flow through to a different strong anion column. The weakly bound enzyme eluted at a low salt concentration. The cell extract must be very dilute in order for the enzyme to bind to the POROS 50HQ column. At this stage, the enzyme was estimated to be greater than 98% pure. The enzyme is difficult to purify because it has a pI of 6.2 with a net negative charge density of only 3.

A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate with Dabcyl and Edans as the FRET pair and a sequence of 12 amino acid residues containing a SARS CoV main proteinase preferred cleavage site has also been used in an assay for the SARS CoV main proteinase [23]. This assay is not very sensitive, because the extinction coefficient of Edans at 336 nm is 5438 M\u22121\ncm\u22121, and the quantum yield is only 0.36 [24]. The quantum yield for Rhodamine110 is greater than 0.90 [7]. Furthermore, a substrate containing FRET pairs incorporated into a peptide of 12 amino acids is very expensive.",

Studies of the 11 conserved interdomain junctions cleaved on the viral polyprotein by the SARS CoV main proteinase revealed that the substrate specificity is determined by the amino acids in the P2, P1 and P1\u2032 positions [17, 18]. All 11 cleavage sites in the SARS coronavirus polyprotein have a conserved Gln in the P1 position, 8 have a Leu in the P2 position, and 9 have either Ala or Ser in the P1\u2032 position. Peptides with other amino acids in the P2, P1, and P1\u2032 positions are poorer substrates or are not cleaved at all. More recently, studies of 34 peptide substrates reveal that residues at positions P4 and P3 are also critical for substrate recognition and binding [25]. The P3 position likes a positively charged amino acid. The P4 position likes amino acids with high \u03b2\u2010sheet tendency, such as Val or Thr.",

They are sensitive substrates, because they are nonfluorescent, but, upon cleavage of a single amide bond become highly fluorescent, exhibiting large molar absorbance coefficients and quantum yields over a wide pH range, from pH 3 to 12. They are particularly useful in the neutral to basic pH range where the output from a xenon lamp is relatively high and where interference from most biological compounds is low. They are specific substrates whose specificity is further enhanced upon cleavage of a single amide bond, because the fluorophore undergoes conversion from the lactone to the quinone state. This process is accompanied by an increase in the degree of conjugation and hence stability which leads to an enhancement of the reactivity of the susceptible bonds in the substrate. They are selective substrates because their structure mimics the amino acid sequence in the reactive site of a proteinase's natural substrate.",

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates have been used to measure the enzymatic activity of the SARS CoV main proteinase. They have yielded K\nm values ranging from 404 to 16 \u03bcM [23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].

The data points in the experiment in Fig. 4A where enzyme activity was plotted as a function of pH could best be fit to a model system with two ionizable groups, pK\na values of 6.8 and 8.7, and an optimal pH of 8. With the archetype cysteine proteinase papain, k\ncat/K\nm values as a function of pH exhibit a bell\u2010shaped curve with a pH optimum of 6\u20137 and pK\na values of 3.3 for Cys25, and 8.3 for His159 [31]. On the other hand, the structure of the rhinovirus 2A proteinase [32] which is structurally similar to the SARS CoV main proteinase [5, 33] also exhibits a bell\u2010shaped k\ncat/K\nm versus pH curve but with an optimum pH of 8 and pK\na values of 7.34 for Cys106 and 8.54 for His28 [34]. The activity of the SARS CoV main proteinase was unusually insensitive to temperature. The optimal temperature was about 42 \u00b0C, but enzyme activity only increased by 37% between 25 and 37 \u00b0C. In contrast, the adenovirus proteinase which is also a cysteine proteinase has a temperature optimum of 45 \u00b0C, and enzyme activity increases 4\u2010fold between 25 and 37 \u00b0C [11]. The SARS CoV main proteinase activity was very sensitive to ionic strength in that 80% of enzyme activity is lost by the presence of 100 mM NaCl. In contrast, the activity of the adenovirus proteinase in the absence of a nucleic acid cofactor is very insensitive to ionic strength. It has been postulated that there may be a salt bridge between Glu166 in the SARS CoV main proteinase and the P3 amino acid in the substrate if it is positively charged [25]. Perhaps this is why enzyme activity is so sensitive to ionic strength.",

The substrate concentration in the experiment in Fig. 6 was 20 \u03bcM; since the K\nm was 306 \u03bcM, the results of this experiment imply that if one were to assay the SARS CoV main proteinase at a substrate concentration equal to the K\nm, enzyme activity from as low a concentration as 66 pM SARS CoV main proteinase dimer could be quantitatively observed.",
