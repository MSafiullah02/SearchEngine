            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on societies and economies around the world. With various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in place, it becomes important to understand emotional responses on a large scale. In this paper, we present the first ground truth dataset of emotional responses to COVID-19. We asked participants to indicate their emotions and express these in text and created the Real World Worry Dataset of 5,000 texts (2,500 short + 2,500 long texts). Our analyses suggest that emotional responses correlated with linguistic measures. Topic modeling further revealed that people in the UK worry about their family and the economic situation. Tweet-sized texts functioned as a call for solidarity, while longer texts shed light on worries and concerns. Using predictive modeling approaches, we were able to approximate the emotional responses of participants from text within 14% of their actual value. We encourage others to use the dataset and improve how we can use automated methods to learn about emotional responses and worries about an urgent problem.",

With an uncertain outlook on the development of the COVID-19 situation and its preventative measures, it is of vital importance to understand how governments, NGOs, and social organizations can help those who are most affected by the situation. That implies, at the first stage, understanding the emotions, worries, and concerns that people have and possible coping strategies they use. Since a majority of online communication is recorded in the form of text data, measuring the emotions and worries around COVID-19 will be a central part of understanding and addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 situation on people.

Either a corpus is annotated on a document-level (i.e., judging a document as positive, neutral, or negative) or individual n-grams are judged on their polarity (i.e., assigning a score to each n-gram on a word list). These annotations are done (semi) automatically (e.g., exploiting hashtags such as #happy) (Mohammad and Kiritchenko, 2015) or manually through third persons (Mohammad and Turney, 2010) . While these approaches are common practice and have accelerated the progress that was made in the field, they are limited in that they propagate a pseudo ground truth. This is problematic because, as we argue, the core aim of emotion detection is to make an inference about the authors emotional or cognitive state. The text as the product of an emotional state functions as a proxy for the latter. For example, rather than wanting to know whether a Tweet is written in a pessimistic tone, we are interested in learning whether the author of the text actually felt pessimistic.",

Whereas real ground truth would requirein its strictest sense -a random assignment of people to experimental conditions (e.g., a group that is given a positive product experience vs. the opposite), variations that rely on self-reported emotions can also mitigate the problem. Datasets that rely on self-reports are the International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions (ISEAR) 1 , which asked participants to recall from memory situations that evoked a set of emotions.

The RWWD is a ground truth dataset that used a direct survey method and obtained written accounts of people alongside data of their emotions and worries. As such, the dataset does not rely on third-person annotation but can resort to direct self-reported emotions. We present two versions of RWWD, each consisting of 2,500 English texts representing the participants' genuine worries about the Corona situation in the UK: the Long RWWD consists of texts that were open-ended in length and asked the participants to express their feelings as they wish. The Short RWWD asked the same people also to express their feelings in Tweet-sized texts. The latter was chosen to facilitate the use of this dataset for Twitter data research.",

In the task, all participants were asked to indicate how they felt about the current COVID-19 situation using 9-point scales (1 = not at all, 5 = moderately, 9 = very much). Specifically, each participant rated how worried they were about the Corona/COVID-19 situation and how much anger, anxiety, desire, disgust, fear, happiness, relaxation, and sadness (Harmon-Jones et al., 2016) they felt about their situation at this moment. They also had to choose which of the eight emotions (except worry) best represented their feeling at this moment. All participants were then asked to write two texts. First, we instructed them to \"write in a few sentences how you feel about the Corona situation at this very moment. This text should express your feelings at this moment\" (min. 500 characters). The second part asked them to express their feelings in Tweet form (max. 240 characters). Finally, the participants indicated how well they felt they could express their feelings (in general/in the long text/in the Tweet-length text) and how often they used Twitter and whether English was their native language. The overall corpus size of the dataset was 2500 long texts (320,372 tokens) and 2500 short texts (69,171 tokens).",

There are significant positive correlations for all affective LIWC variables with their corresponding self-reported emotions (i.e., higher LIWC scores accompanied higher emotion scores, and vice versa). These correlations imply that the linguistic variables explain up to 10% and 3% of the variance in the emotion ratings for long and short texts, respectively. The LIWC also contains categories intended to capture people's concerns, which we correlated to the self-reported worry. Positive (negative) correlations would suggest that the higher (lower) the worry score of the participants, the larger their score on the respective LIWC category. We found no correlation between the categories \"work\", \"money\" and \"death\" suggesting that worry was not associated with these categories.

We reported initial findings on the linguistic correlates of emotional states, used topic modeling to understand what people in the UK are concerned about, and ran prediction experiments to infer emotional states from text using machine learning. These analyses provided several core findings. (1) Some emotional states correlated with word lists made to measure these constructs, (2) longer texts were more useful to identify patterns in language that relate to emotions than shorter texts, (3) Tweet-sized texts served as a means to call for solidarity during lockdown measures while longer texts revealed peoples worries, and (4) preliminary regression experiments indicate that we can infer from the texts the emotional responses with an absolute error of 1.26 on a 9-point scale (14%).",

When we used psycholinguistic word lists that measure these emotions, we found weak, positive correlations. The lexicon-approach was best at measuring anger, anxiety, and worry and did so better for longer texts than for Tweet-sized texts. In behavioral and cognitive research, small effects (here: a maximum of 10.63% of explained variance) are the rule rather than the exception (Gelman, 2017; Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017) . It is essential, however, to interpret them as such. If 10% of the variance in the anxiety score is explained through a linguistic measurement, 90% are not. An explanation for the imperfect correlations -aside from random measurement error -might lie in the inadequate expression of someone's felt emotion in the form of written text. The latter is partly corroborated by even smaller effects for shorter texts, which may have been too short to allow for the expression of one's emotion. ",

First, to mitigate the limitations of lexicon-approaches, future work on inferring emotions and worries around COVID-19 could expand on the prediction approach (e.g., using binary classification and different feature sets and models). Carefully validated models could help to provide the basis for large scale, real-time measurements of emotional responses. Of particular importance is a solution to the problem hinted at in the current paper: the shorter, Tweet-sized texts contained much less information, had a different function, and were less suitable for predictive modeling. With much of today's stream of text data coming in the form of (very) short messages, it is important to understand the limitations of using that data and worthwhile examining how we can better use that information.",
