In both toxins, the B-subunits recognize and bind to host cell-surface receptors. For Stxs, these are thought to be primarily neutral glycolipids, namely globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3 or CD77) or globotetraosyl ceramide (Gb4); for ricin, these are thought to be glycoproteins or glycolipids containing terminal galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNac) residues (Baenziger and Fiete 1979; Debray et al. 1981; DeGrandis et al. 1989; Jacewicz et al. 1986; Lindberg et al. 1987; Nicolson and Blaustein 1972; Sandvig and van Deurs 1996; Waddell et al. 1988). The A-subunits of both toxins have N-glycosidase activity which results in depurination of a single adenine (A-4324) located on the alpha-sarcin loop (sarcin/ricin loop) of the 28S ribosomal RNA (Endo et al. 1987; Endo and Tsurugi 1987; Endo et al. 1988). This particular event is discussed elsewhere in this volume.",

            "text": "The B-subunit is essential for host cell binding, endocytic uptake, and retrograde trafficking of the holotoxin following which the toxin follows one or more retrograde trafficking pathways from the early endosome, through the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Arab and Lingwood 1998; Girod et al. 1999; Lingwood et al. 1998; Rapak et al. 1997; Sandvig et al. 1992; Sandvig and van Deurs 1996; Sandvig and van Deurs 1999; Sandvig and van Deurs 2000; Walchli et al. 2008; White et al. 1999). In the ER, the A-subunit of Shiga toxin is proteolytically cleaved and undergoes reduction of an intramolecular A-subunit disulfide bond, thereby freeing the enzymatically active portion of the A-subunit from the B-subunits (Garred et al. 1995, 1997; Yu and Haslam 2005). Similarly, once in the ER, reduction of a disulfide bond in ricin allows separation of the A- and B-subunits (Simpson et al. 1999; Spooner et al. 2004). The freed A-subunits are retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytoplasm where the toxins have access to the ribosome (Simpson et al. 1999; Wesche et al. 1999; Yu and Haslam 2005). These events are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this volume. The depurination of the ribosome by Stx and ricin A-subunits is a critical event in activation of host signal transduction pathways resulting in the proinflammatory response (Foster et al. 2000; Foster and Tesh 2002; Iordanov et al. 1997; Lindauer et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2003; Thorpe et al. 1999).",

We will also discuss effects of the Shiga toxin B-subunit on host signal transduction pathways. Data from animal models and human illness in which Shiga toxin- and ricin-induced proinflammatory responses are observed will be discussed elsewhere in this volume. It should be noted that while some toxin-associated signaling seems to drive uptake and retrograde trafficking of the toxins, other pathways seem to be more directed to activation of inflammatory/apoptotic pathways. However, in some cases, the distinction between trafficking-related and inflammatory/apoptotic signaling is not entirely clear, and will be noted. Finally, the details of toxin-induced effects on apoptosis will be discussed in detail elsewhere in this volume. Here we will simply note when a specific host signal transduction event is also linked to eventual apoptosis.",

In general, activation of MAPK signaling begins with the sensing of either mitogenic or stress-related stimuli by cells (Fig. 1). This results in activation of a MAPKinase signaling module, in which one or more MAP3Kinases phosphorylate and activate MAP2Kinases, which subsequently phosphorylate and activate one or more of the MAPK family. The MAPK family is comprised of extracellular-receptor kinases (ERKs), p38, and the jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (reviewed in Kyriakis and Avruch (2001)). The \u201cstress activated protein kinase family\u201d or \u201cSAPKs\u201d is sometimes used to further describe p38 and JNKs.\n",

Although this damage to the ribosome results in inhibition of protein synthesis, a MAPKinase-driven proinflammatory (and eventually pro-apoptotic) signaling cascade is also activated. This signaling cascade was originally termed the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) after Iordanov et al. (1997) observed that treatment of cells with certain protein synthesis inhibitors including ricin, anisomycin, and \u03b1-sarcin caused the activation of jun-N-terminal Kinase (JNKs), while other protein synthesis inhibitors, including cycloheximide, emetine, T-2 toxin, pactamycin, and puromycin, did not (Iordanov et al. 1997). Also, treatment of cells with emetine, which arrests the ribosome in a pretranslocation state, prevented subsequent induction of the RSR. This important work demonstrated that initiation of the RSR required actively translating ribosomes at the time of toxic insult. Furthermore, these data suggested that specific interactions and/or damage to the ribosome, versus inhibition of protein synthesis per se, were the triggering events for JNKs activation.",

Therefore, the RSR can be defined as the activation of JNKs, p38, and/or ERKs by toxicants that act to disrupt the 28S ribosomal RNA on functional ribosomes. Also, in addition to Stxs and ricin, the list of ribotoxic stressors includes anisomycin, \u03b1-sarcin, UV-light, and the trichothecene toxins (Iordanov et al. 1997, 1998; Laskin et al. 2002; Shifrin and Anderson 1999; Thorpe et al. 1999; Zhou et al. 2003). Despite the fact that these agents cause inhibition of global translation, activation of the RSR results in a paradoxical increase in expression of proinflammatory proteins (Cherla et al. 2006; Foster and Tesh 2002; Gonzalez et al. 2006; Thorpe et al. 1999, 2001). Although much of the increase in proinflammatory gene expression is mediated at the transcriptional level, post-transcriptional events may also be important (discussed below in Sect. 4).",

Thus, one potential caveat to using MAPKinases as therapeutic targets may be the lack of pathway specificity. Therefore developing inhibitors that target signaling components upstream in the MAPK signaling module such as a specific MAP3kinase might provide a better therapeutic strategy for treating the disease. In the case of illnesses mediated by Stxs and ricin, understanding how damage to the ribosome is specifically detected by the cell and how this information is relayed through to the MAPKinase cascade could prove important in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets that block the RSR. However, the mechanism cells use to detect damage to the 28S rRNA and subsequently transduce this signal through the RSR remains unknown. To date, three upstream effectors of the RSR have been described and are reviewed herein. These include the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activated protein kinase (PKR); hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck); and the zipper sterile alpha motif kinase (ZAK) (Fig. 2).\n",

            "text": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a trichothecene toxin which when added to macrophage and monocyte-like cells induces the RSR with activation of ERKs, p38, JNKs, production of TNF-\u03b1, and induction of apoptosis (Moon and Pestka 2002; Shifrin and Anderson 1999; Yang et al. 2000; Zhou et al. 2003). The exact mechanism by which DON causes damage to the 28S rRNA is not clear, but DON does not have a direct effect on purified mammalian ribosomes in vitro (Li and Pestka 2008). Zhou et al. (2003) demonstrated that DON treatment of RAW 264.7 cells resulted in possible activation of PKR as evidenced by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, a downstream target of PKR (Zhou et al. 2003). Furthermore, treatment of cells with PKR inhibitors or antisense knockdown of PKR resulted in a decrease of DON-induced MAPKinase activation as well as apoptosis. Knockdown of PKR also blocked apoptosis by the ribotoxic stressor anisomycin and by the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine. Using human monocytic U937 cells, Gray et al. 2008, demonstrated that expression of a dominant-negative PKR blocked Stx1-, ricin-, or DON-induced IL-8, verifying that PKR activation was not specific to DON treatment, but may be activated by other ribotoxic stressors as well (Gray et al. 2008).",

That PKR is a critical player in the macrophage/monocyte RSR is further supported by the findings of Bae et al. 2010, who were able to demonstrate in murine peritoneal macrophages that DON is able to recruit p38 to the ribosome (Bae et al. 2010). Since p38 is not recruited to the ribosome in mice deficient in PKR, PKR activation may be required for DON-induced p38 activation. Because PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA, it has been proposed that damage to the 28 rRNA by ribotoxic stressors such as Stx, ricin, or DON (which ultimately results in cleavage of the 28S rRNA in intact mammalian cells (Li and Pestka 2008)) provides a substrate (presumably double-stranded RNA) that activates PKR. This would result in recruitment and activation of MAPKinases to the ribosome thereby initiating subsequent downstream signaling (Bae and Pestka 2008; Gray et al. 2008).",

ZAK was first shown to transduce activation of JNKs and p38 by anisomycin, and was later shown to do the same for Stx2 and ricin (Jandhyala et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2005). Stx2-, ricin-, and anisomycin-induced activation of p38 and JNKs was shown to be blocked in COS-7, Vero, and HCT-8 cells by pretreatment with the ZAK-specific inhibitor 7-[3-fluoro-4-aminophenyl-(4-(2-pyridin-2-yl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-b]pyrazol-3-yl))]-quinoline also called DHP-2 (IC50 = 17 nM), or by knocking down ZAK with siRNA (COS-7 and Vero cells) (Jandhyala et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2005). DHP-2 pretreatment was also shown to block Stx2 and ricin induction of interleukin-8 expression as well as inhibit caspase-3 activation and some toxin-mediated cell death. Similarly, the chemotherapeutic agents sorafenib (K\nd for ZAK = 6.3 nM) and nilotinib (K\nd for ZAK = 3 nM) decreased ricin-induced p38 and JNKs activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (Lindauer et al. 2010). However, in these cells, ZAK inhibition did not effect ricin-induced activation of the NALP3 inflammasome and subsequent post-translational IL-1\u03b2 processing (discussed further below). These data support the concept that signaling cascades outside the RSR are also important for the proinflammatory effects of ricin.",

Both ZAK\u03b1 and ZAK\u03b2 share an identical N-terminus composing the kinase domain and leucine zipper, but ZAK\u03b1 has an extended C-terminus containing a sterile alpha motif (Gross et al. 2002). While the respective roles of the two isoforms in ribotoxic stress signaling are currently not known, ZAK\u03b2 may become phosphorylated following treatment with the antineoplastic agent and ribotoxic stressor doxorubicin, as suggested by the presence of an extra band of higher molecular weight on western blots (Sauter et al. 2010). ZAK activation of p38 and JNKs seems to be fairly specific for the RSR, as other stimuli including TLR 5 signalling, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 do not seem to signal through ZAK (Jandhyala et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2005).

            "text": "There is some data to suggest that host translation initiation pathways may be activated in response to Shiga toxins. There are three ways by which translation initiation can be effected. First, activation of Mnk1 by ERKs and/or p38 results in phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). When phosphorylated, eIF4E promotes initiation through enhanced recognition of mRNAs with complex 5\u2032 capping, preferentially recruiting these mRNAs to the ribosome. Second, activation of FRAP/mTOR can result in hyperphosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). When hypo- or unphosphorylated, 4E-BP1 has decreased affinity for eIF4E, resulting in increased activity of eIF4E. Finally, FRAP/mTOR activation results in phosphorylation of S6 Kinase 1, which promotes translation initiation of mRNA species that have a 5\u2032 oligopyrimidine tract. 5\u2032 oligopyrimidine tracts are frequently found in mRNAs encoding proteins required for ribosome biogenesis. Activation of all three pathways by Stx1 have been demonstrated in both HCT-8 and differentiated THP-1 cells (Cherla et al. 2006, 2009; Colpoys et al. 2005), and may act to maintain translation despite ribosomal intoxication (Colpoys et al. 2005) and/or allow for translation of specific cytokines (Cherla et al. 2006, 2009). Thus, host cells appear to be capable of modulating translational initiation in response to these toxins, perhaps with some host benefit and/or contribution to pathogenicity.",

NF-\u03baB in its inactive form resides in the cytoplasm where it binds to a member of the I\u03baB family of proteins I\u03baB\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b2, or I\u03baB\u03b5. Activation of NF-\u03baB occurs by phosphorylation of I\u03baB, which leads to the subsequent trafficking of phospho-I\u03baB to the proteosome for degradation. This allows the liberated NF-\u03baB, with its now exposed nuclear localization motif, to translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, NF-\u03baB activates the transcription of genes with promoters containing an NF-\u03baB binding site. Many immediate early response genes, and proinflammatory genes have NF-\u03baB binding sites in their promoters.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which NF-\u03baB is activated following treatment with ricin is not known; however, it is possible that the RSR is contributory to its activation. Activation of MAP3Ks, including ZAK, have been shown to result in NF\u03baB activation (Liu et al. 2000; Malinin et al. 1997), and activation of NF-\u03baB by the ribotoxic stressor DON has been shown to occur subsequent to MAPK activation (Zhou et al. 2003), suggesting that MAPK activation is upstream to that of NF-\u03baB. Consistent with Stx- and ricin-induced NF-\u03baB activation being downstream to MAPK activation, we have shown that inhibition of ZAK results in decreased expression of the CXC chemokine IL-8 (Jandhyala et al. 2008), which is regulated at the transcriptional level by both AP-1 and NF-\u03baB (Jung et al. 2002; Mukaida et al. 1994). However, we did not specifically assess the role of NF-\u03baB activation in this response, and we have observed enhanced stabilization of multiple CXC chemokine mRNAs following Stx treatment (Thorpe et al. 2001). Similarly, by treating U937 cells with inhibitors of PKR or by expressing a dominant- negative PKR in U937 cells, Gray et al. 2008 were able to decrease Stx1-, ricin-, and DON-induced IL-8 message (Gray et al.  2008). While this inhibition of IL-8 could result from decreased AP-1 activation or post-transcriptional events such as mRNA destabilization, Gray et al. 2008 also demonstrated that following DON treatment, U937 cells expressing the dominant-negative PKR had decreased NF-\u03baB binding activity, and treatment of U937 cells with SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, resulted in decreased DON-induced NF-\u03baB binding activity. Together these studies suggest that NF-\u03baB activation by DON and possibly Stx and ricin, may occur at least in part from RSR-induced MAPK activation. However, further studies using Stx and ricin are needed to confirm that NF-\u03baB activation is indeed associated with the RSR.",

Although it is not completely understood how PAMPs and/or DAMPs transduce inflammasome activation, upon detection of these stimuli, the inflammasome complex is assembled by a member of the NALP protein family of NOD-like receptors (NLR), such as NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, and the adaptor protein ASC that forms a scaffold connecting the NLR with caspase-1 (Fernandes-Alnemri et al. 2009; Tschopp et al. 2003).

However, in this same study, the co-administration of ricin plus IL-1\u03b2 restored the ability of ricin to elicit pulmonary inflammation and neutrophil recruitment in IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2-deficient mice. By contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which plays an important role in the development and progression of chronic respiratory disease including asthma (Liu 2004), requires neither IL-1R nor IL-18R or caspase-1 to mediate a pulmonary inflammatory response, including neutrophil recruitment and vascular leak (Togbe et al. 2006). Administration of aerosolized ricin to macrophage-depleted mice resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory transcripts, reduced accumulation of neutrophils, and decreased microvascular barrier permeability, indicating that macrophages are required for ricin to mediate inflammatory responses in the lungs (Lindauer et al. 2009). Taken together, the evidence demonstrates that IL-1 plays a key role in mediating proinflammatory responses signaled by ricin in the airways, and that macrophages are required for mediating these proinflammatory responses.",

The second signal induces the processing of the pro-IL-1\u03b2 protein into the mature 17 kDa IL-1\u03b2 by the inflammasome (Mariathasan and Monack 2007; Martinon et al. 2002; Ogura et al. 2006; Yu and Finlay 2008).

Ricin failed to induce the expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2 in unprimed macrophages, demonstrating the requirement for prior exposure of macrophages to an NF-\u03baB-activating agent such as LPS. The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG-132 blocked ricin-induced release of IL-1\u03b2 from macrophages, suggesting that ricin-induced inhibition of translation may foster the disappearance of labile protein(s) that normally suppress inflammasome formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of protein synthesis by a variety of translation inhibitors appears to potently activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (B. Magun, unpublished), suggesting that the ribotoxic effects of ricin and potentially other inhaled toxins may contribute to inflammatory lung disease through inflammasome activation. Figure 3 describes a model that implicates ricin in mediating two distinct signals that lead to expression and processing of IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages. The first signal leads to the activation of ZAK and subsequent expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2. The second signal, inhibition of translation, leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent release of IL-1\u03b2.\n",

The UPR is activated when unfolded and/or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER (reviewed in (Kim et al. 2008; Tsai and Weissman 2010)). The UPR acts by halting global protein translation to limit delivery of nascent proteins to the ER for folding, and preferentially reprograms transcription and translation pathways involved in restoring ER function. This also includes activation of transcription factors that regulate these pathways. In the event that ER homeostasis cannot be regained, apoptotic signaling cascades are then activated. The master regulator of ER homeostasis, BiP (or GRP78), is an ER chaperone that is central to activation of the UPR. ER-stress has been associated with a variety of pathologies including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders such as prion disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and diabetes (Hosoi and Ozawa 2009; Kim et al. 2008; Lhotak et al. 2011; Sharma et al. 2006; Zhang and Kaufman 2008).",

PERK, IRE-1, and ATF-6 are membrane spanning proteins, the luminal portions of which are thought to interact with BiP. During ER-stress it is believed that BiP is recruited away from these effectors by excess unfolded proteins, an event that triggers their activation (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation and subsequent activation of PERK results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF2\u03b1. Inactivation of eIF2\u03b1 results in translational \u201creprogramming\u201d, including cessation of global mRNA translation, while preferentially allowing translation of certain transcripts involved in ER recovery, such as that of the transcription factor ATF-4. ATF-4 regulates the promoters of UPR associated genes including that of GRP78 and CHOP the latter of which is important for inducing ER-stress-associated apoptosis. Activation of the second major effector, IRE-1, results in its splicing of the mRNA for X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). XBP1 protein up-regulates transcription of ER-chaperones and p58\nIPK. IRE-1 can also activate the MAPKs p38 and JNKs through a pathway involving TRAF2 and the MAP3K ASK1. Upon activation, the third UPR effector, ATF-6, is trafficked to the Gogli apparatus, modified by proteolytic cleavage, and subsequently translocated to the nucleus to activate the transcription of genes including CHOP and XBP1, BiP, PDI, and GRP94.\n",

In this study, CHOP mRNA was up-regulated, and accompanied by Ca2+ influx from the ER to the cytosol. This latter event was thought to possibly result in the calpain-dependent activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8, which was detected following Stx1 treatment. Interestingly activation of the UPR was not able to be assigned categorically to either Stx \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d subunit activity. Catalytically deficient toxin (Stx1AE167Q,\nR170L) was unable to induce activation of PERK and ATF-6. However, IRE-1 activation, Ca2+ influx, and partial XBP1 splicing effects were retained. These data suggest that at least some aspects of Stx1- mediated ER-stress may be dependent on A-subunit catalytic activity, but signaling from both the A-subunit and the B-subunit appears to contribute. These data would support a complex model, in which multiple Stx activities (such as toxin trafficking, ER-to-cytoplasmic A-subunit translocation, and intoxication) contribute to the overall activation of the UPR.",

It should be noted that unlike Stxs and ricin, DON, being a small molecule of 296.3 Da, does not have a binding subunit. Interestingly, although BiP is generally upregulated during ER-stress, in this study it was shown to be proteolytically degraded in response to DON treatment. Also, RNAi knockdown of BiP expression caused an increase in IL-6, suggesting that DON-induced BiP degradation might promote an IL-6 response in these cells. Interestingly ricin was also shown to induce BiP degradation. Together these results suggests that DON- and ricin-induced ER-stress might trigger IL-6 production through BiP degradation.",

Parikh et al. show that expressing ricin in yeast such that it is translocated into the ER results in suppression of HAC1 mRNA splicing, an event dependent on the yeast homolog of IRE1, IREp. Ricin mutants that lacked N-glycosidase activity were shown not to inhibit the UPR, suggesting the involvement of the ricin active site. Cell survival during ER-stress is thought to be sustained by prolonging IRE1 activation, which normally terminates around 8 h of continuous ER-stress (Lin et al. 2007). Therefore it is feasible that inhibition of IRE1 by ricin may also promote toxicity in yeast. As noted above, IRE1-mediated XBP-1 splicing was also absent following ricin treatment of human breast and colon cell lines (Horrix et al. 2011). However, it should be noted that unlike mammalian cells, yeast are not able to be intoxicated with Stx or ricin via the B-subunit. Thus, toxin A-subunit-encoding constructs with appropriate ER delivery signals must be used. Furthermore, unlike mammals, yeast do not have known PERK and ATF-6 homologs, thus limiting the ability of using yeast to study mammalian ER-stress events.",

However, the precise mechanisms by which Stx and ricin induce ER-stress are currently not understood. It is possible that following inactivation by Stx or ricin, ribosomes that are engaged in active translation of secreted proteins at the cytosolic surface of the ER remain attached to the incompletely translated nascent peptides at the cytosolic domain of the Sec61 translocon, thereby clogging the secretion machinery of the ER. In an attempt to remediate this situation, intoxicated cells may activate the UPR. However, it is also possible that B-subunit accumulation in the ER, or the partial unfolding of Stx or ricin A-subunits prior to cytosolic translocation, may effect ER-stress. Further studies are required to elucidate the exact cause(s) of Stx- and ricin-mediated ER-stress.",

In addition to activating Yes, treatment with Stx1 results in recruitment of Yes to the lipid rafts. (However, during or following activation, Yes then becomes detergent soluble). Yes activation is transient: maximal activation of Yes occurs within 10 min post-Stx1 treatment, and diminishes by 30\u201360 min.

Sandvig et al. (1989) demonstrated that Stx could promote its own uptake in HeLa cells, and Lauvrak et al.

Walchli et al.

Treatment of HeLa cells with Stx1B-subunit resulted in detectable p38 phosphorylation in as early as 1 min and peaked within 10-15 min. In HEp-2 cells, Walchli et al. 2008 did not see translocation of p38 to the nucleus, but instead p38 appeared to be recruited to endosomal fractions. Importantly, modifications of intracellular Ca2+ appeared to be necessary for p38 activation by the Stx B-subunit suggesting that Ca2+ signaling is upstream of Stx-induced p38 activation. This was also supported by the findings that inhibition of p38 by SB203580 does not effect Stx inhibition of histamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Finally, inhibition of p38 or siRNA knockdown of p38 had no effect on ricin trafficking to the Golgi, implying that ricin uses a different pathway.",

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura has many of the same signs as HUS, but is generally associated with a deficiency in ADAMTS13, a protease responsible for cleaving unusually large vWF multimers. Recently, data has emerged linking B-subunit activity with vWF secretion from endothelial cells. B-subunits alone from Stx1 or Stx2 were able to stimulate secretion of vWF in HUVECs and promote platelet adhesion in human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (HGMECs) (Huang et al. 2010). In addition, this induction of vWF secretion occurred within 5 min of toxin (B-subunit) treatment, and required cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, but not clathrin. Because Stx2 is more often associated with diarrhea-associated HUS (D+HUS), it was particularly interesting that in this study, Stx2B was found to be a more potent inducer of vWF in HUVECs than Stx1B. Comparisons of Stx2B treatment of TTP-prone, ADAMS13\n\u2212/\u2212 mice with that of heterozygous ADAMS13\n+/\u2212 litter mates showed that ADAMS13\n\u2212/\u2212 mice developed reticulocytosis and fragmented red cells. In addition, 5 of the 13 Stx2B-treated ADAMS13\n\u2212/\u2212 mice developed thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. These data suggest that StxB-subunits might promote endothelial cell activation by inducing vWF secretion and promoting platelet adhesion. One caveat to these findings is the observation that unlike TTP, thrombi from patients with D+HUS tend to be rich in fibrin, while containing little or no vWF (Tsai et al. 2001).",

These may be, and probably are, very different from effects of StxB-subunit on host cells. It is known that depletion of sphingosine appears to promote ricin trafficking, and depletion of cholesterol inhibits it (Grimmer et al. 2006). This suggests that cholesterol may play a role in endocytosis, and that lipid raft association of ricin receptors may actually impede ricin uptake. The observations that Gb3 located in lipid rafts are required for some of the signal transduction events associated with Stxs suggest that Gb3 in these cell types is \u201cwired\u201d to signaling networks in a way that has not been described for ricin.",

The first of these relates to the key signaling events that contribute to morbidity in Stx- and ricin- mediated disease. Filling this gap will involve understanding which outputs are the most necessary for promoting damage to the host. For example, are there particular cytokine responses that if blocked will prevent or help alleviate disease? Alternatively, is it apoptosis, or inflammation, that drives morbidity? In the case of ricin, the development of good animal models has helped elucidate the role of IL-1 in promoting ARDS. However, in the case of Stx, the \u201cconnect\u201d between pro-inflammatory and/or pro-apoptotic signaling with microangiopathic disease is still very much undetermined.
