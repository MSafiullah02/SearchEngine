Most European countries limit the diagnosis of bronchiolitis to infants age 12 months or younger and typically do not include those with a previous history of wheezing, whereas the USA uses an older age limit of less than 24 months (1). Bronchiolitis is one of the most common and costly respiratory illnesses in infants and young children (2) . Approximately, 100 000 bronchiolitis admissions occur annually in the USA at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion (3). In Finland, up to 3% of infants with bronchiolitis under 12 months of age are hospitalised, and up to 9% require intensive care (4) . In Finland, the mean hospitalisation cost for a bronchiolitis patient is \u20ac1800 and this figure goes up to \u20ac8000 if paediatric intensive care is needed (4) .",

These guidelines seldom recommend specific interventions and instead they try to prevent the use of irrelevant diagnostic tests or ineffective drug treatments or other interventions. Despite the high frequency and cost of bronchiolitis care, there has been limited research on the variability of care between different hospitals (9, 13, 14) . Therefore, our aim was to investigate bronchiolitis-related practice variations in three tertiary care university hospitals in Finland. Due to the expected variability in the diagnostic and management practices, we wanted to investigate practice variation in two subgroups of children who were less than two years of age when they were hospitalised for bronchiolitis. The first subgroup was those who met our strict definition of bronchiolitis, as they were aged under 12 months of age without a history of wheezing and the second subgroup was those who did not meet our strict definition as they were 12-23 months of age or had a history of wheezing.",

As in its USA counterpart study (16) , a standardised protocol was used to enrol a target number of consecutive patients from the inpatient ward and the intensive care unit. Inclusion criteria were an attending physician's diagnosis of bronchiolitis, age under two years and informed consent from a guardian. Patients were enrolled within 18 hours of admission. The exclusion criteria were previous enrolment or transfer to a participating hospital more than 48 hours after the original admission time. All patients were treated at the discretion of the treating physician.

Each component was assigned a score of zero, one or two, with the exception of wheezing, which was assigned either zero (no wheezing) or two (wheezing), and then summed for a possible total score of zero to eight per patient. When a child had one or two of the RDSS components missing (n = 174), single imputation controlling for age, respiratory rate, presence of wheezing, air entry and retractions, was used to generate the score.

The first model accounted for random site effects but did not adjust for patient-level characteristics. The second, more complete model specified random site effects while simultaneously adjusting for patient-level characteristics, that is age, sex, insurance provider, major relevant comorbid disorder and RDSS. Therefore, the ICCs derived from our models that specify only random site effects represent the proportion of the total outcome variation that is attributable to site-level differences without adjusting for patientlevel characteristics.

According to guidelines, clinicians should diagnose bronchiolitis and assess disease severity on the basis of history and physical examination and radiographic or laboratory studies should not be obtained routinely (12, 22, 23) . However, clinicians should assess risk factors for severe disease, such as age less than 12 weeks, a history of prematurity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or immunodeficiency, when making decisions about evaluation and management of children with bronchiolitis. We speculate that the long travel distances between home and hospital at Site B might explain some of these results.

On the contrary, the variability of corticosteroid use was rather low, but it was used quite often among children with loose definition of bronchiolitis. Use of nebulised epinephrine in bronchiolitis patients less than 12 months was national practice in Finland before new randomised trials were published (24) (25) (26) . This practice was also seen in the study comparing Finnish and Swedish bronchiolitis treatment practices (14) . According to recent guidelines, beta agonists and corticosteroids are the most commonly overused, nonevidence-based therapies (12, 22, 23) . Several studies and reviews have evaluated the use of bronchodilators for bronchiolitis patients under two years old, but most randomised controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit (6) . The same is true for use of corticosteroids (8, 27) . The major limitation of these earlier studies was that a subgroup of high asthma risk children was not evaluated separately (20, 21) . However, much of the continued use of bronchodilators and corticosteroids may arise from similarities in the signs and symptoms between bronchiolitis and asthma, especially with those children close to age two years having risk factors for asthma or recurrent wheezing (28, 29) . It is not surprising that clinician chooses to try beta agonists for these older children with asthma risk factors. Most likely, a 23-month-old child with RV infection and a history of wheezing has a different kind of disease than a threemonth-old infant with RSV. As the current guidelines do not separate these two subgroups, it might be that what is true for the treatment of strict definition of bronchiolitis is not necessarily true for treatment of loose definition of bronchiolitis.",

Guidelines do not prefer either hydration methods, but nasogastric tube can be considered more physiological, and easier to implement, although it may trap mucus and prolong wheezing.

We evaluated several clinical factors that might have influenced clinical decision-making including parent history of asthma, history of previous wheezing, RDSS, fever and comorbid conditions, but these factors did not explain the variability of practice. Our cohort represented severe bronchiolitis cases because all were admitted to hospital. Therefore, ideally, there should have been less observed site variability in tests and treatments. In this paper, we show that even after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, wide variations between hospitals persisted. Furthermore, wide variation in practice was seen between strict and loose bronchiolitis subgroups. However, this study was not designed to determine the causes for the practice variation; reasons for testing and treatment were not queried. Also, the study was performed before publication of the current guidelines, so we do not know how well the latest guidelines are followed. The follow-up studies are currently ongoing.",
