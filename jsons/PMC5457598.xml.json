            "text": "VEGF was originally identified by its properties as both a permogen and a mitogen, key elements in the function of the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to interest in its role in many forms of lung disease particularly ARDS [1\u20133]. We and others found that VEGF levels were compartmentalised between the alveolar space and the vascular bed [4, 5]. Low levels of intrapulmonary VEGF were found in patients with ARDS with increasing intrapulmonary VEGF levels associated with recovery [5]. In contrast, plasma levels in patients with ARDS were elevated compared with normal, at-risk, or ventilated control subjects, with falling levels associated with recovery [6]. These data suggest that VEGF is beneficial in the alveolar space but detrimental in the vascular space. To explore the significance of these observations, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that regulate VEGF bioactivity. VEGF exerts its biological effect through specific receptors, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 and co-receptors, neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 [7]. In addition, alternative splicing of VEGF transcripts leads to the generation of several functionally different isoforms [8, 9]. We have previously explored changes in VEGFxxx-isoforms and receptor expression as mechanisms for regulating VEGF bioactivity and suggested that both these factors may contribute [10] but do not fully explain the reported contradictory findings. The VEGFxxxb isoform family consists of peptides of the same length as other forms but with a different C-terminal six amino acids-SLTRKD rather than CDKPRR [11]. The receptor binding and dimerisation domains are intact, but VEGFxxxb stimulates a unique pattern of VEGF-R2 tyrosine residue phosphorylation, contrasting with those activated by conventional isoforms [9]. Two specific isoforms, VEGF165a and VEGF165b isoforms were shown to have contrasting effects on the epithelial and endothelial sides of the alveolar-capillary membrane [12]. These data suggest a pneumotropic effect which could be beneficial within the alveolar space following ARDS. However, the effect of these isoforms on vascular permeability another key element of ARDS is unknown.",

To explore this theory, we used three methods of assessing vascular barrier function and found contrasting effects with VEGF165a increasing permeability and VEGF165b decreasing permeability. We then explored the relationship of downstream pathways to these functional differences. We compared the effects of specific signalling pathway inhibitors of MEK/p38MAPK/PI3K and eNOS on permeability, cell migration and proliferation to identify a mechanism by which increased permeability could be resolved whilst maintaining beneficial cell proliferation and migration.",

We went on to analyse potential cytoskeleton remodelling induced by VEGF isoforms. VE-cadherin has been particularly associated with endothelial cell adherens junctions but may also contribute to change in tight junction activity [19, 20]. Previously, a changed distribution to a zig-zag pattern in VEGF165a treated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) was demonstrated using 100 ng/ml stimulation [20]. We repeated this experiment using HPMEC and showed similar results suggesting a significant change in VE-cadherin distribution between the cells stimulated with VEGF165a (Fig. 2a). Visible gaps appeared between the cells with an apparent zig-zag pattern of VE-cadherin distribution between adjacent cells. In contrast, stimulation with the VEGF165b isoform induced minimal change compared to untreated control cells suggesting it did not induce VE-cadherin reorganisation (Fig. 2a). In addition, changes in the actin structure were observed between the stimulated and the unstimulated cells demonstrating an increase of stress fibres across the cells and more actin filopodia with VEGF165a. Again, in contrast, there was only a partial induction of actin filaments in the cell periphery and stress fibres by VEGF165b (Fig. 2b). These data led to the hypothesis that VEGF165a and VEGF165b activate different signalling pathways involved in permeability in HPMEC.\n",

The integrity of the adherens junction is particularly critical for regulating paracellular permeability via homophilic adhesions between VE-cadherin molecules [19, 20]. Disruptions of these domains lead to downstream events that result in organisational changes in the actin cytoskeleton [44]. The transcellular pathway is responsible for the transport of larger molecules such as albumin across endothelial cell monolayers, classically via transcellular pores associated with caveolae and lipid rafts [45]. Traditionally these pathways have been considered independent but there is now a body of evidence showing interdependence [46]. Following on from this, the in-vitro methods of measuring permeability that we have used, TEER (thought to reflect only paracellular permeability) and FITC-BSA (thought to only reflect transcellular mechanism) are recognised to have influences from crosstalk between both pathways [15].",
