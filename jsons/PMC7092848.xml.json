The gene of SARS 3C-like protease was a gift from Dr. Li and was amplified by PCR using primers 3CLsm and 3CLr (see Table 1\nfor the sequences of primers). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI, and inserted into NcoI/XhoI cut plasmid pET-28a. The plasmid, pET28a-3CLsm, encodes a 34.7 kDa (3CLsm) protein flanked at a C-terminal His6-tag and with the first amino acid Ser replaced by Met. The PCR product of a mutant using primers 3CLsc and 3CLr was digested with NheI and XhoI, and inserted into NheI/XhoI cut plasmid pET-28a. The resulting plasmid, pET28a-3CLsc, encodes a protein (3CLsc) containing a 31-mer peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASSITSAVLQ; N31-tag) flanked at N-terminal and a C-terminal His6-tag. An auto-cleavage site was located between N31-tag and the N-terminal of the protein. This 31-mer sequence was also introduced to four mutants using the identical method as pET28a-3CLsc.",

We mutated these two residues of the enzyme and obtained four mutants, H41A, H41W, C145A, and C145S. The mutants were characterized by SDS\u2013PAGE and the proteolytic activities were measured in trans-cleavage assay. But, different from 3CLsm, the activities of H41A, H41W, C145A, and C145S were all under the detection limitation in trans-cleavage assay, even, when the incubation time was prolonged to 16 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, the activity of 3CLpro has a great dependence on enzyme concentration because the active form of enzyme was suggested to be a dimer. We had increased the concentration of the mutants up to 15 \u03bcM, but still no activity was detected. Even higher enzyme concentration could not be used because it will cause aggregation and precipitation at room temperature within a few hours. The great difference in trans-cleavage assay between 3CLsm and the mutant enzymes strongly supports a crucial catalytic function of His41 and Cys145, and is consistent with the published data of other 3CL/3C proteases [8].",

In contrast with their finding, although all 3CL proteases have conservative catalytic site characteristics, no activity could be detected for the corresponding Cys-to-Ser mutants of the mouse hepatitis virus and human coronavirus strain 229E 3CLpro in trans-cleavage assay [4], [5]. One explanation for this discrepancy is that cis-cleavage assay has high sensitivity over the trans-cleavage one [8]. In our study, Cys-to-Ser substitution also produced an enzyme with undetectable activity in trans-cleavage assay. So we decided to test the cleavage activity of this mutant in the novel cis-cleavage assay.",

It suggested that the three mutants did not show enzyme activity. The results could serve as a negative control; it excluded the possibility that proteolytic process was caused by the expression system. The cleavage should be performed by SARS-CoV 3CLpro itself. Interestingly, for C145S mutant, there were two bands visualized in SDS\u2013PAGE (see Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6). The apparent molecular mass showed that the upper band retained the N31-tag and the lower one did not.
