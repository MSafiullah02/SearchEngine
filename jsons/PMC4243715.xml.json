To protect this vital organ against infection and inflammation, many defense mechanisms have been evolved in the lung to prevent the development of pulmonary infections. The secretion of endogenous cationic antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells onto the airway surface represents an important component of immune defense in the lung [7-9]. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of these antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and cathelicidin, in the pulmonary immune system and in pulmonary diseases [10-12].",

Hepcidin not only shows antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, but also functions as a principal iron regulatory hormone [13-15]. Hepcidin binds to the iron export protein ferroportin and induces its internalization and degradation, which leads to decreased cellular iron export and increased intracellular iron retention [16,17]. Because iron is an essential nutrient for all organisms, hepcidin also restricts the iron available to invading microbes, thereby enhancing the host defense against pathogens [17-19]. Furthermore, hepcidin can modulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammatory response via the suppression of cytokine expression [20,21]. The multiple functions of hepcidin suggest its importance in the host immune response to infection and inflammation. Recent studies have reported that in addition to being produced mainly by hepatocytes, hepcidin is also expressed by other cells, such as airway epithelial cells (AECs) [22]. However, the role of AEC-derived hepcidin in pulmonary immune defense against infection and inflammation remains unknown.",

Briefly, the double-strand shRNA oligo was cloned into pENTR/U6 vector using the BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi Entry Vector Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The expression clone was then generated by recombination of pENTR/U6 entry construct and pAd/BLOCK-IT-DEST vector using BLOCK-iT Adenoviral RNAi Expression System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After digested by endonuclease PacI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), the recombinant adenoviral plasmid was transfected into 293A cells. The harvested adenovirus was concentrated and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. Viral titer was determined using Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). The recombinant virus and control virus were named Ad-shHepc1 and Ad-shNeg, respectively.",

Because the lung is the first vital organ that is adversely affected at the onset of sepsis [31], the elevated expression of hepcidin may protect the mice against lung injury. To support this hypothesis, knockdown of hepcidin in AECs exacerbated sepsis-induced lung injury (Figure 3). Considering that disruption of hepcidin has a deleterious effect, a low severity of CLP model was used in the current study. Since the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis is based on the severity grade of the CLP model, the increase in lung injury parameter such as wet/dry weight ratio was minuscule but significantly different.",

            "text": "Hepcidin is a master regulator of iron metabolism via its interaction with ferroportin. Hepcidin can trigger ferroportin polyubiquitination and induce ferroportin endocytosis [32,33]. In the lung, AECs express high levels of hepcidin and are the main source of local hepcidin production. Alveolar macrophages express ferroportin and are therefore target cells for hepcidin [22]. In the present study, knockdown of hepcidin in AECs impacted its interaction with ferroportin, and prevented degradation of the ferroportin protein in both alveolar macrophages and the lung, which consequently caused intracellular iron export into the pulmonary microenvironment. The elevated iron in the lung can be used not only for invading pathogen growth and replication, resulting in more virulent and persistent infections [18], but also to generate reactive oxygen species, leading to cell damage and lung injury [34,35]. On the other hand, a recent study showed that iron status could impact cytoskeleton rearrangement, which is important for the phagocytic process in macrophages [36]. Indeed, the alveolar macrophages from Ad-shHepc1-treated mice showed less phagocytosis ability than those from the control animals. Since liver is the major source of systemic hepcidin, in the current study liver hepcidin levels were not affected and circulating iron concentrations were comparable between the Ad-shNeg- and Ad-shHepc1-treated mice. Therefore, the function of circulating leukocytes should not be influenced. Although the inciting injury (CLP) is remote, when the bacteria circulating in the blood stream invaded the lung after CLP, the decreased phagocytosis function of the alveolar macrophages from the Ad-shHepc1-treated mice could result in bacterial accumulation in the lung. In addition, as hepcidin exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial properties [37], the knockdown of hepcidin may contribute to more severe pulmonary infections and lung injuries.",

The contradictory findings between the current study and Frazier\u2019s study may result from the difference between the in vivo model and ex vivo model used and the nature of hepcidin peptide. Moreover, limited by the sensitivity of the Prussian blue staining method, the iron content in the AECs was undetectable in this study. Because the role of AECs in pulmonary iron metabolism is much less than that of alveolar macrophages [22], the iron status in AECs may not play a major role in the pathophysiology of lung injury.",

Previous studies found that low intracellular iron in macrophages could impair the translation of specific inflammatory cytokine transcripts, such as IL-6 [39,40].
