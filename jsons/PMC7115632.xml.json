            "text": "In November 2002, an influenza-like acute pneumonia designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the World Health Organization, first emerged in China and spread to 29 countries within a few months. By July 2003, 8098 probable cases with 774 deaths were reported (www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mguide_sars.html). The etiologic agent of SARS was identified as a novel type of coronavirus (CoV) that was genetically distinct from previously characterized members of the Coronaviridae family [1], [2], [3]. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is a positive stranded RNA virus with an approximately 30 kb genome encoding non-structural proteins as well as structural proteins, including spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid. Spike protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates binding to the host cell receptor using an amino-terminal S1 domain and membrane fusion using a carboxyl-terminal S2 domain [4]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds to the S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein and functions as a receptor for SARS-CoV [5]. CoV spike protein is a major target of protective immunity [6], and neutralizing (NT) antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes against SARS-CoV spike protein have been detected in SARS patients [7], [8]. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV spike protein is an appropriate target for vaccines and therapy.",

Although the civet cat and bats are suspected to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV, the reservoir of SARS-CoV has yet to be identified [9], [10], [11]. In addition, the precise mechanism underlying the development of SARS is not clear and the therapeutic guidelines for SARS have not been established. It has been reported that prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 reduces viral replication and excretion in SARS-CoV infected macaques [12]. Although pegylated IFN-\u03b1 may eventually become a good therapeutic agent for SARS after infection, it cannot provide long-term protection when used as a prophylactic agent. Therefore, the development of a SARS vaccine is imperative. Several groups have reported a number of SARS vaccine candidates, including inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines [13], [14], DNA vaccines [15], [16] and recombinant viral vaccines [17], [18], [19] expressing one or more SARS-CoV structural proteins. Recombinant live viral vaccines can generally induce strong and long-term immunity, similar to an attenuated live vaccine, and can be abundantly manufactured in a short period of time. More importantly, a safe vaccine can be developed using an attenuated strain that has already been proven safe.",

A long DNA fragment is able to be inserted into the VV genome by homologous recombination without damaging viral integrity, as the VV genome is large and contains genes non-essential for viral replication. In fact, recombinant VV can express various proteins encoded by the transduced gene, including the glycosylated proteins of pathogens, some of which have been evaluated as candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [20]. Lister is the attenuated VV strain that was used in the worldwide smallpox eradication program. However, additional attenuated strains were generated from Lister due to its side effects, which included erythema, fever and encephalitis. LC16m8 was isolated from Lister via the intermediate strains, LC16 and LC16mO, by multiple plaque purification in primary rabbit kidney cells. LC16m8 is characterized by temperature sensitivity and the formation of small pocks [21]. No serious side effects were observed among the over 100,000 people who were immunized with LC16m8, while the immunogenicity of LC16m8 is similar to that of Lister [22]. Therefore, LC16m8 was authorized as the vaccine against smallpox by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1975.",

At 24 h after transfection, the virus was harvested. HA negative plaques were cloned as described previously [26]. Briefly, the harvested virus was re-infected into RK13 cells. At 96 h after infection, cells were washed with PBS (+) twice, and then incubated with chicken erythrocytes for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C. Following washing again with PBS (+), white plaques were isolated. Isolated viruses were cloned by three serial rounds of plaque purification using erythrocyte agglutination and then propagated in RK13 cells. Insertion of the SARS-CoV spike protein gene into LC16m8 genome was confirmed by direct PCR and expression was detected by Western blotting. The viral titer of RVV-S was determined using the standard plaque assay.",

The in vitro NT assay against VV revealed that LC16m8 and RVV-S equally induced NT antibodies against VV in the rabbits (Fig. 3C). NT activity against VV was induced by 108\n PFU of RVV-S at 1 week after immunization, similar to SARS-CoV. The NT titer against VV, which reached 1:10,000 at 2 weeks after boost immunization with 108\n PFU of RVV-S, was similar to that induced by 108\n PFU of LC16m8. These results suggest that the epitopes of the NT antibodies against VV were preserved in RVV-S. Since VV has been used as a smallpox vaccine in humans, we were concerned that RVV-S might be eliminated by the host's immune response before inducing effective immunity against a protein encoded by the transduced gene. Therefore, to assess whether RVV-S can induce NT antibodies against SARS-CoV in rabbits that had NT antibodies against VV, RVV-S was injected into rabbits which had been pre-immunized with LC16m8. NT antibodies against VV were induced in the rabbits by single immunization with 107\n PFU of LC16m8 and the NT titer reached 1:64\u2013256 (Fig. 4A). By following immunization with an equal dose of RVV-S (107\n PFU), NT antibodies against SARS-CoV were induced in all three rabbits, although induction of NT antibodies was delayed in one rabbit (R14). Although the induction of NT antibodies against SARS-CoV was partially suppressed in the LC16m8 pre-immunized rabbits, the NT titer further increased in all three rabbits by boost immunization with RVV-S (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that RVV-S can induce NT antibodies in individuals who have been previously immunized with a smallpox vaccine. Next, we examined whether RVV-S induced NT antibodies against SARS-CoV in rabbits with a high titer of NT antibodies against VV. The NT titer against VV in rabbits that had been immunized twice with 108\n PFU of LC16m8 was sustained at approximately 1:4000 (Fig. 4B). Although these rabbits had an extremely high titer of NT antibodies against VV, NT antibodies against SARS-CoV were induced in all three rabbits upon a booster injection with 108\n PFU of RVV-S (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, the NT titer of these rabbits increased to levels comparable to those of the non-pre-immunized rabbits (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that an immune response against a protein encoded by a transduced gene can be induced by immunization with 108\n PFU of RVV in spite of the pre-existence of NT antibodies against VV.",

These finding indicate that NT antibodies against spike protein are sufficient to protect against SARS-CoV infection. Single immunization with 107 or 108\n PFU of RVV-S and two immunizations with 106\n PFU of RVV-S were able to induce a high level of NT antibodies against SARS-CoV at 2 weeks after immunization. Therefore, RVV-S also may protect against SARS-CoV in vivo and would be a highly effective vaccine against SARS in na\u00efve individuals.",

[30] reported that immunization with MVA/S did not prevent SARS-CoV infection in ferrets but rather produced inflammatory responses and focal necrosis in the liver after SARS-CoV challenge. This may have been due to only low NT activity against SARS-CoV being induced by the MVA/S immunization. Moreover, the precise mechanism of this liver inflammation has not been clarified. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), another member of the coronaviruses, exhibited enhanced FIPV infection into monocytes/macrophages through viral-specific antibody binding to the Fc receptors of these cells, and caused enhanced inflammation [31]. However, there is no evidence that NT antibodies against SARS-CoV cause antibody-dependent enhancement, and correlation between inflammation and antibody-dependent enhancement by MVA/S vaccination has not yet been established. The side effects of vaccines are also influenced by the dosage and route of immunization. In Czub's report, MVA/S was intraperitoneally injected into the ferrets, although most vaccinations with RVV are conducted through other routes, such as intradermal, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Therefore, selection of a different immunization route may prevent such side effects. Nonetheless, further analysis of the side effects of various SARS vaccines, including RVV-S, is required in in vivo SARS-CoV challenge models in a variety of animals.",

            "text": "Using RVV-S as a candidate SARS vaccine means that possible complications due to previous vaccination with the VV for smallpox may be avoided. Hammarlund et al. [32] reported that a particular antiviral antibody against poxvirus is maintained for a very long time (possibly for life) by immunization with the smallpox vaccine. Therefore, there was concern that a RVV vaccine would be eliminated by the host antiviral immune response before induction of effective humoral and/or cellular immunity against the protein encoded by the transduced gene. However, immunization with 107\n PFU of RVV-S induced NT antibodies against SARS-CoV in rabbits that had been immunized with 107\n PFU of LC16m8. Since the NT titer against VV induced by 107\n PFU of LC16m8 was comparable to that in people vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine [32], RVV-S may induce NT antibodies against SARS-CoV in such people. On the other hand, 108\n PFU of RVV-S also induced NT antibodies against SARS-CoV in rabbits that had an extremely high titer of NT antibodies against VV due to two pre-immunizations with 108\n PFU of LC16m8. Furthermore, there was no difference in the NT titer against SARS-CoV induced by RVV-S between na\u00efve rabbits and LC16m8 pre-immunized rabbits. The immune response against a protein encoded by a transduced gene may be influenced by the amount of antigen expression, the antigenicity of the protein encoded by a transduced gene, the route of immunization and viral proliferation in the host, and thus further analysis is required to resolve the precise mechanism involved. Furthermore, the vaccine effect of RVV-S still needs to be confirmed in humans pre-immunized with the smallpox vaccine.",
