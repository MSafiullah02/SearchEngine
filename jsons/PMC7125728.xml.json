The selective retention of an imaging probe at a site of interest is based either on its high-affinity binding to a specific target, such as a hormone receptor, or on the occurrence of a specific chemical modification, such as phosphorylation, that traps it within a cell (Fig. 1\n). Many different tracer molecules are now employed to study a variety of pathophysiologic processes. When applied to virology research, SPECT and PET have been used almost exclusively to image host responses to infection, rather than to visualize viral replication. The only instance in which a pathogen-specific tracer has been employed to detect and track a virus has been the use of a radiolabeled thymidine analogue to image herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, based on phosphorylation of the probe by the viral thymidine kinase (TK), which traps it within infected cells (Fig. 2\n) (Brader et al., 2009, Kuruppu et al., 2007).",

Next, we show how the recent development of recombinant oncolytic viruses encoding host reporter molecules provides a proof of concept for virus-specific imaging. We then examine how researchers have taken advantage of the selective phosphorylation of thymidine analogues by the HSV TK to image HSV infections, and how the TK has also been used as a recombinant marker to image tumors, gene therapy and other conditions. Next, we identify a number of processes unique to viral replication that might serve as targets for radiolabeled pathogen-specific tracers. We then review nine different DNA and RNA virus families, identifying approved and experimental antiviral drugs that target virus-encoded molecules, and might have potential as radiolabeled probes. We conclude by explaining how researchers can determine the potential of an antiviral drug or antibody as a radiolabeled imaging probe by using the 3H- or 14C-labeled compound in simple in vitro and ex vivo experiments.",

            "text": "Antiviral therapy and nuclear medicine share a common origin in the efforts of Paul Ehrlich to develop antimicrobial medications in the early 1900s. His concept of the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d was based on the observation that certain dyes stained microbes, but not surrounding cells, in tissue sections, suggesting that the selective binding of other small molecules to pathogens could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. To find a substance that specifically inhibited Treponema pallidum, Ehrlich tested more than 600 compounds with varied side chains until he found one that was toxic for the spirochete, but not its host. Two decades later, Georges de Hevesy followed the same line of reasoning when he used radioactive compounds as \u201ctracers\u201d to explore mechanisms of drug action. At that time, bismuth was a component of a number of compounds employed for the treatment of syphilis. To determine their distribution within the body, de Hevesy introduced radioactive bismuth into the medications, inoculated them into the bloodstream of rabbits and followed their distribution and clearance from blood and tissues (Hevesy and Paneth, 1938, Lomholt, 1925). The concept of using a low-dose radioactive tracer to study a biochemical process in which it directly participates is still followed today in developing probes that target cell surface and intracellular receptors, enzymes and other molecules (Eckelman et al., 2008, Phelps, 2000, Rudin et al., 2005).",

The optimal pharmacokinetic properties of an antiviral agent differ, however, from those of an ideal imaging probe: continuous high drug levels in the blood and tissues are beneficial for therapy, but for SPECT or PET imaging, such persistence of the tracer would result in a high background signal and poor image contrast. As discussed below, an ideal imaging probe differs from a drug, in that it should be retained at sites of interest, but cleared rapidly from non-target tissues.",

In SPECT imaging, photons in the energy range of 80\u2013400 kEV impact on sodium iodide crystal detectors within camera heads that revolve around the subject, enabling the assembly of a three-dimensional image (Fig. 4A). Photons from outside the region of interest and nonspecific scatter arising within the subject are blocked by collimators (perforated metal blocks) placed in front of the detectors, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

PET instruments are therefore configured as a ring of detectors surrounding the subject. By registering a signal only when two photons of the correct energy strike opposite sides of the ring simultaneously, the SNR is markedly increased. This intrinsic mechanism allows PET to provide better spatial resolution than SPECT (approximately 4 mm for clinical imaging and 1\u20132 mm for animal microPET systems), and facilitates the accurate quantitation of radioactive decay within a region of interest. Such quantitative data lend themselves to statistical analysis of pathologic abnormalities and assessment of response to treatment, and are especially useful for monitoring cancer therapy.",

Saturable targets in antiviral therapy are generally those in which the therapeutic molecule occupies a target site, and only a limited number of sites are available for binding. Examples include the binding of pleconaril within a cleft in the capsid of some picornaviruses, the blocking of the influenza M2 ion channel by amantadine, and the binding of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor to a locus on the HIV RT, distinct from its active site.

First, the probe must have the needed pharmacokinetic properties to reach the target (see below). Second, it should have a high affinity for its binding site, as measured by the K\nd (the concentration at which 50% of binding sites are occupied at equilibrium). Third, there must be a sufficient number of targets within the region of interest so that the accumulation of the bound tracer will result in a detectable signal. In practice, this means that it is possible to image low-density targets, as long as the K\nd of the tracer\u2013target interaction is in the nanomolar range (or less) and the fraction of labeled probe molecules (the specific activity) is high. When these conditions are met, a minute quantity of tracer, much too small to cause any pharmacologic effect, can produce an image (Jagoda et al., 2004, Eckelman, 1994, Eckelman et al., 2002, Eckelman et al., 1979).

            "text": "In contrast, the target of a non-saturable probe is generally an enzyme that alters the chemical structure of the probe, in a manner that favors its retention at the target site. For antiviral therapy, the classic non-saturable target is the HSV TK, which phosphorylates acyclovir, causing it to accumulate within HSV-infected cells. As described below, this property of the HSV TK has also permitted the extensive use of the recombinant enzyme as an imaging reporter for SPECT and PET. The principal application of a non-saturable target in radionuclide imaging makes use of 2-deoxyglucose (DG), a glucose molecule lacking a 2-hydroxyl group that is readily phosphorylated by the host cell hexokinase, but cannot be further metabolized, and remains trapped within the cell (Fig. 1). DG can be labeled with fluorine-18 at the 2 position, to form 18F-DG (FDG), without changing its metabolic activity. Because malignant cells tend to have a high rate of glucose metabolism, DG was originally tested as an anti-cancer drug, but it proved too toxic for clinical use (Woodward and Hudson, 1954, Pauwels et al., 2000). At low dose, however, FDG is not toxic, and it can be used as a probe to label cells with high glycolytic activity. FDG is now widely used to identify foci of increased glucose metabolism, such as tumors or sites of inflammation, by PET imaging (Fig. 6\n) (De Winter et al., 2002, Kumar et al., 2008).",

SPECT isotopes, on the other hand, emit photons in the lower energy range of 60\u2013400 kEV, which are more likely to be scattered or absorbed. In addition, degradation of image quality is worsened, the further the target is from the detector. An advantage of SPECT, however, is that because the various tracers emit photons with a range of energy peaks, it is possible to image more than one target in the same session, by setting the instrument's computer algorithms to separate signals of different energies. PET isotopes, in contrast, all produce photons of the same energy, making it necessary to perform separate imaging sessions if two different probes are used to study the same subject.",

However, the isotope's short half-life means that its use is only practical if one possesses an on-site cyclotron and adequate radiochemistry support. Those lacking such resources would be better off using a 18F-labeled probe, because its 108-min half-life makes it possible for synthesis to take place off-site, but still allows a subject to be imaged twice daily. The limitation of this approach is that the introduction of a fluorine atom into the probe may require a difficult chemical synthesis, and it may also alter the molecule's biochemical characteristics (in this case, its antiviral efficacy).

Because clearance takes time, the radioisotope must have a long enough half-life to ensure that adequate activity remains in the region of interest once the background signal has reached a low level, so as to maximize the target-to-background ratio.

As a result of increased perfusion and enhanced vascular permeability, the radionuclide accumulated at sites of infection. Other approaches include the intravenous infusion of 111In-labeled polyclonal human immunoglobulin or a patient's own 111In-tagged leukocytes (Buscombe et al., 1993, Kumar, 2005).

The same technique has shown that peripheral lymph nodes have a greater glucose uptake in untreated HIV-infected individuals than in patients on antiretroviral therapy, indicating that lymph nodes are sites of viral replication (Brust et al., 2006). FDG-PET was used recently to characterize a patient with severe swine-origin H1N1 influenza, showing that an intense inflammatory response was present both in areas of dense pulmonary consolidation as seen by CT scan and in regions of aerated lung (Fig. 6) (Bellani et al., 2010, Bellani et al., 2009).

This group includes a second human enzyme, TK2, that is found at low concentrations in mitochondria. It also includes the TK encoded by the alpha-herpesviruses, of which HSV is the best-known member. The broad substrate specificity of the HSV TK is the basis of antiviral therapy with acyclovir and other nucleoside analogues. Acyclovir enters cells from the bloodstream by diffusion or active transport across the cell membrane. In uninfected cells, the drug is not modified by TK1, and only a minimal amount is phosphorylated by the mitochondrial TK2, so that almost all of it diffuses back into the bloodstream and is eliminated by the kidneys. In HSV-infected cells, however, the viral TK converts acyclovir to its monophosphate, which is then converted by cellular kinases to the triphosphate. Because acycylovir triphosphate has a 20- to 100-fold greater affinity for the HSV DNA polymerase than for the host enzyme, it is preferentially incorporated into replicating viral genomes, causing chain termination (Elion, 1983). The selective retention of acyclovir and related antivirals in HSV-infected cells and their rapid clearance from uninfected tissues enhances their potential utility as imaging probes, by increasing the target-to-background ratio.",

In a series of studies, rats were infected intraocularly with HSV-1, and after an appropriate interval were injected intravenously with a small dose of 14C-labeled 2\u2032-fluoro-5-methyl-1-\u03b2-d-arabinosyluracil (FMAU) or with 131I- or 125I-labeled E-5-(2-iodovinyl)-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (IVDU) (Gill et al., 1984, Klapper et al., 1988, Price et al., 1983, Saito et al., 1984, Cleator et al., 1988). Foci of encephalitis were identified either by killing animals and performing autoradiography on brain slices, or by imaging live animals using a gamma camera. However, only weak signals were obtained. Similar studies have been performed more recently using 11C-labeled FMAU, but the results of in vivo imaging were not shown (de Vries et al., 2000).

Such drugs therefore inhibit both herpesviruses and poxviruses. Because their initial phosphorylation is performed by a host enzyme, they accumulate in normal cells, making them unsuitable for use as virus-specific imaging agents. Interestingly, recent research has identified some thymidine analogues that inhibit the replication of wild-type vaccinia virus significantly better than a virus lacking a TK gene, suggesting that their mechanism of action resembles that of acyclovir (Prichard et al., 2007, Prichard et al., 2006).

Because most drugs that inhibit the viral polymerase are converted to their monophosphate by a cellular kinase, and are therefore trapped within both infected and uninfected cells, they would not be suitable as virus-specific imaging probes. An alternative approach, which has been successful for HIV therapy, and is now being used to target hepatitis C and other viruses, is to identify non-nucleoside molecules that bind to a locus on the surface of the viral polymerase, rather than to its active site, inducing a conformational change that blocks its enzymatic activity (Fig. 3).

The first is an in vitro assay, in which the labeled drug is added to the liquid medium of a number of flasks or wells of virus-infected and uninfected cells.

Thin sections are cut and placed onto microscope slides, which are then immersed in a solution of labeled 14C- or 3H-labeled drug, rinsed to remove unbound tracer and placed against film or phosphor imaging plates for autoradiography (Saito et al., 1984, Frey and Albin, 2001, Cagnin et al., 2007, Patel and Gibson, 2008, Stumpf, 2005). Once a sufficient exposure time has elapsed, the films are examined to determine if radiolabeled drug has preferentially been retained at sites of viral infection. To check for specificity, various amounts of unlabeled (\u201ccold\u201d) drug can be added to the solution of labeled compound, to determine if it will compete for binding to sites of infection, reducing the detected signal. Additional thin sections would be used for immunohistologic studies, to confirm the presence of virus-infected cells.",

After an appropriate delay, the animals are killed, organs of interest are removed, samples are collected for determination of viral titer by plaque titration and of probe concentration by scintillation counting or autoradiography, and sections are prepared for immunohistologic study. If sites of maximum viral replication also show the highest levels of radioactivity, and much lower signals are detected in uninfected tissues, this would suggest that the drug has potential as a virus-specific probe. As in ex vivo studies, the specificity of binding can be further evaluated by administering various amounts of unlabeled drug along with the labeled probe, to see if competition takes place.",
