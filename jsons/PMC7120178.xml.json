            "text": "Originally, the term endophyte was introduced by de Bary (1866) and was assigned to all those microbes that reside inside the living healthy tissues of the plants. Later, this term was expanded as fungi and bacteria including actinomycetes, which spend the whole or at least a part of their life cycle colonizing inter- or intra-cellularly, inside the healthy living tissue of the host plant, typically causing no apparent symptoms of disease. Many workers define the endophytes in different ways, but Bacon and White (2000) gave a conclusive and widely accepted definition of endophyte as \u2018microbes that colonize living, internal tissues of plant without causing any immediate, overt negative effect\u2019. Endophytes are extremely diverse and range from fungi Carroll and Carroll (1978), Petrini (1986), Rajagopal and Suryanarayanan (2000), Gond et al. (2007), to bacteria Hallmann et al. (1997) including actinomycetes Verma et al. (2009a), but the fungi are most studied group of endophytes and among fungi the best studied endophytes are intercellular symbionts from ascomycetous family Clavicipitaceae in the grasses of temperate zone. The presence of endophytes was observed from algae to angiosperm studied till date Aly et al. (2010). The literature suggests that endophytes augment resistance in their hosts against herbivores Brem and Leuchtmann (2001), pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, nematodes Gond et al. (2010), illness Clay (1990), reduced seed production Rice et al. (1990), temperature and salinity Redman et al. (2002) and also against drought and minerals Malinowski et al. (1997).",

            "text": "Development of drug resistance to pathogenic forms of bacteria, fungi and other microbes, emergence of lethal viruses, the perpetuating epidemics in developing and under developing countries, and multifold fungal infection, enhancement in human population globally, all shows our inability to overcome these biomedical problems. In addition to this, we are also unable to assure people towards enough food security in specific regions of the earth and in India too, to support the local human population. Environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and spoilage of land and water also added to the problems facing mankind. The access of new disease causing agents like AIDS, SARS, Ebola and already epidemic like malaria, leismania and encephalitis requires the discovery and development of new therapeutic drugs that target them specifically within the cellular metabolism. Due to safety and the environmental problems, many synthetic agricultural agents have been and currently are being targeted for removal from the market, which creates a need to find the alternative ways to control farm pests and pathogens. In search of these new and lead molecule/or drug, we have to find out new and alternative resources, and endophytic fungi are one of them which could be explored for this purpose Kharwar and Strobel (2011). After the discovery of taxol (billon dollar anticancer drug) from an endophytic fungus Taxomyces andreanae, research related to fungal endophytes got a great attention for rich and novel alternative source of natural bioactive compounds Stierle et al. (1993). The number of research publications only related to secondary metabolites (115) from fungal endophytes during period of 2000\u20132009, itself indicates the attention of researchers to this field of study Aly et al. (2010). Since the fungal endophytes are relatively less studied group of microbial flora, but are responsible for several prospects such as biodiversity, ecology, bioactive natural products (metabolomics) and nanotechnology. Therefore, this chapter is not very specific and covers almost prospects of fungal endophytes which could be useful in biodiversity, agrochemicals, biotechnology, biomedical and nanotechnology in ecofriendly manner.",

Actually, non culturable behaviour of these microbes and lack of precise techniques of isolation may be the reasons for not reporting them frequently from plants except a few reports (Verma et al. 2009a). The most frequently isolated endophytes are the fungi. However, at outset, it is important to note that the vast majority of plants have not been studied for any endophytic association. Thus, enormous opportunities exist for the recovery of novel fungal forms, including genera, biotypes, as well as species in the myriad of plants yet to be studied in different settings and ecosystem. Hawksworth and Rossman (1987) estimated there may be as many as 1.5 million different fungal species, while only about 100,000 have been described. As more evidence accumulates, estimates keep rising as to the actual number of fungal species. For instance, Dreyfuss and Chapela (1994) have estimated at least one million species of endophytic fungi alone.",

Phomoxanthones A (9) and B (10) isolated from an endophytic Phomopsis sp., are known to display antimalarial activity Isaka et al. (2001). Endophytic Geotrichum sp. collected from Crassocephalum crepidioides have found to produce 7-butyl-6,8-dihydroxy-3(R)-pent-11-enylisochroman-1-one (11) and 7-butyl-15-enyl-6,8-dihydroxy-3(R)-pent-11- enylisochroman-1-one (12) Kongsaeree et al. (2003). The above mentioned four anti malarial compounds are also antibacterial which have already been described in previous section. 2-chloro-5-methoxy-3-methylcyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (26) and xylariaquinone A (27) are novel benzoquinones that were isolated from an endophytic Xylaria sp. Tansuwan et al. (2007). Codinaeopsin (28) is another antimalarial agent, isolated from an endophytic fungal isolate CR127A (98% idetical to Codinaeopsis gonytrichoides) collected from Vochysia guatemalensis (a white yemeri tree) Kontnik and Clardy (2008). Monocerin (29) and its new analogue 11-hydroxymonocerin (30) were isolated from cultures of Exserohilum rostratum, a fungal strain endophytic in Stemona sp. Sappapan et al. (2008). Two new eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids, eremophilanolides 2 (31) and 3 (32) were isolated from an endophytic fungus BCC 21097 of Licuala spinosa Isaka et al. (2010).

            "text": "About 100 anticancer compounds have been isolated from endophytic fungi yet, and among them 57% are novel, while rest are previously known Kharwar et al. (2011). Taxol (33) is highly functionalized diterpene and is the first compound possessing the taxane ring, isolated from the bark of the Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew) for the first time by Wani et al. (1971) and named it as \u2018taxol\u2019. Its effectiveness against ovarian and breast cancers make the drug highly valuable. For the first time in history, Stierle et al. (1993) isolated this important compound from a fungus Taxomyces andreanae endophytically associated with Taxus brevifolia. After this discovery, a number of scientists isolated Taxol from different endophytic fungi associated with different hosts such as Bartalinia robillardoides and Pestalotiopsis terminaliae, the endophytic fungi of Aegle marmelos and Terminalia arjuna, Gangadevi and Muthumary (2008, 2009). Camptothecin (34), another important anticancer compound previously known to be isolated from wood of Camptotheca acuminata plant was isolated from an endophytic fungus of Nothapodytes foetida, Entrophosphora infrequens and Neurospora sp. for the first time by Puri et al. (2005) and Rehman et al. (2008), respectively. This very compound with two of its analogues, 9-methoxycamptothecin (35) and 10-hydroxycamptothecin (36) also isolated from Fusarium solani an endophytic fungus of Camptotheca acuminata Kusari et al. (2009). Additionally, 9-methoxycamptothecin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin do not have the therapeutic drawbacks as it found in plant camptothecin even after showing the similar activity. The similar nature of compound is also reported with vincristine (37) produced by Fusarium oxysporum, an endophyte of Catharanthus roseus Zhang et al. (2000), Tung et al. (2002). Emindole DA (38) isolated from Emericella nidulans var. acristata an endophyte of a Mediterranean green alga showed the antitumor activity against 36 human tumor cell lines Kralj et al. (2006). Leptosphaerone C (39) and penicillenone are the novel anticancer polyketides isolated from Penicillium sp. JP-1, an endophytic fungus associated to the Aegiceras corniculatum (mangrove plant). Leptosphaerone C showed activity against A-549 cells, whereas penicillenone exhibits cytotoxicity against P388 cells Lin et al. (2008). An endophyte Alternaria sp., isolated from Polygonum senegalense (Egyptian medicinal plant) had produced three lactone compounds, alternariol (40), alternariol 5-O-sulfate (41), alternariol 5-O-methyl ether (42), and a phenol derivative altenusin (43) bearing cytotoxic activity against L5178Y cells Aly et al. (2008). Phomoxanthones A (9) and Phomoxanthones B (10) describe avtivity against KB, BC-1, Vero cell lines Isaka et al. (2001). Merulin A (44) (nor-chamigrane endoperoxide) and C (45) (chamigrane endoperoxides) are two new sesquiterpenes produced from an endophytic fungi XG8D, member of class basidiomycetes isolated from mangrove plant, Xylocarpus granatum Konig (Meliaceae). Both the compounds showed significant cytotoxicity against human breast (BT474) and colon (SW620) cancer cell lines Chokpaiboon et al. (2010). Phomopsis longicola, an endophytic fungus of the Dicerandra frutescens (endangered mint) produces three cytotoxic compounds dicerandrols A (46) B (47) and C (48) against two human cancer cell lines, A-549 and HCT-116 Wagenaar and Clardy (2001). Two new, Oblongolide (hexaketide \u03b3-lactone) Y (49) and Z (25) have been isolated from Phomopsis sp. BCC 9789 associated with Musa acuminata (wild banana) as an endophyte. Oblongolide Y showed cytotoxic activity against BC line while Oblongolide Z had shown cytotoxic activities against KB, BC, NCI-H187, and nonmalignant (Vero) cell lines Taridaporn et al. (2010). Six noble benzofuranone-derived \u03b3-lactones, photinides A-F (50\u201355) isolated from a single endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis photiniae resides inside Roystonea regia. All six noble \u03b3-lactones exhibit cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-2311 (human tumor cell lines) Ding et al. (2009).\n\n",

Cryptocin (3) possesses antifungal activity against phytopathogens like Pythium ultimum, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Phytophthora citrophthora, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Pyricularia oryzae, Rhizoctonia solani, Geotrichum candidum, Fusarium oxysporum Li et al. (2000). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolated as an endophyte from Artemisia mongolica produced colletotric acid (8) showed antibacterial and antifungal activity against Helminthosporium sativum Zou et al. (2000). Ambuic acid, (64) a highly functionalized cyclohexene isolated from endophytic Pestalotiopsis sp. and Monochaetia sp. showed significant antifungal property against several pathogens like Fusarium solani, F. cubense, Helminthosporium sativum, Diploidia natelensis, Cephalosporium gramineum and Pythium ultimum Li et al. (2001). Endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis jesteri isolated from Fragaraea bodenii has produced jesterone (65), a highly functionalized novel cyclohexenone epoxides exhibits antifungal ability in opposition to Pythium ultimum, Aphanomyces sp., Phytophthora citrophthora,P. cinnamomi, Rhizoctonia solani and Pyricularia oryzae Li and Strobel (2001). Pestacin (56) and Isopestacin (57) are isobenzofurans isolated from Pestalotiopsis microspora obtained as an endophyte from Terminalia morobensis. Both compounds exhibit antioxidant and antifungal activity against pathogenic fungus Pythium ultimum Strobel et al. (2002), Harper et al.

However, the refined research indicates that this effect is not only due to endophytic Cuvularia, but was also due to a Curvularia thermal tolerance virus (CThTV) as a third partner, which parasitized on C. protuberate Marquez et al.

Now these days, the nanotechnology shows valuable scope in communication, energy, electronics, instruments, optical engineering, defence and security, cosmetics, bioengineering, nanofabrics, agri food industry, biomedicals and drug delivery. The nano food market is the fastest growing sector where this technology could be used in the production, processing and packaging. A nanocomposite coating process may improve food packaging by placing antimicrobial agents directly on the surface of the coated film. Further, the research is carried out to the detection of chemical and biological substances for sensing biochemical changes in foods quality. As per the survey of Helmut Kaiser consultancy the nanofood market will surge from 2.6$ billion to 20.4$ billion by 2011 Verma et al. (2009\nb). There are many chemical and physical approaches for synthesis of nano particles, but they are highly costly and hazardous to environment. Therefore, scientific community looks for ecofriendly, cost effective and an alternative technology, and the one step biosynthesis or green synthesis is one of them, which synthesizes nanoparticles of useful metals (Au, Ag, Cd, Pt, Ti, Zn and Pd) via biological tools such as Bacteria Yong et al. (2002), fungi and actinomycetes Sastry et al. (2003), Verma et al. (2010), algae Brayner et al. (2007) and plants Narayanan and Sakthivel (2008). Recently, a number of fungi including endophytic such as Fusarium semitectum, Verticillum sp., Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillum fellutanum were successfully employed for synthesis of metal nano particles (NPs). Endophytic Aspergillus clavatus isolated from Azadirachta indica collected from Banaras Hindu University was efficiently able to synthesize the silver NPs of 5\u201355 nm. These NPs showed the antifungal (Candida albicans) and antibacterial (E. coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens) activity Verma et al. (2010). Verticillium sp. isolated from Taxus sp., when challenged with ions of silver and gold led to biofabrication of silver and gold nanoparticles within the fungal biomass Sastry et al. (2003). These examples are enough to prove the use and role of endophytic fungi in different aspects of nanotechnology.",

            "text": "Historically, the study of endophytes has been limited more or less to botanists to observe their ecology, diversity, distribution and biologics. However, in recent years, the discovery of novel chemical compounds produced by endophytes has opened the field to structural chemists, biochemists, and medical and industrial scientists as well. The endophytes based bioactive compounds/drugs can only be achieved through interdisciplinary cooperation of research including botanists, microbiologist, molecular biologists, structural chemist, biochemist and pharmacologists. Before dealing the endophytic research we must take care of the basics, such as (i) Location: It is one of the most important criteria as tropical and subtropical rain forests contain the largest diversity of plant species, and can be utilized to discover diverse species of endophytes for the identification of novel anti-fungal and anti-bacterial natural products. In addition to these habitats, researcher should also consider other habitats such as those in the desert and high elevation Alpine passes. (ii) History: The plants with ethanobotanical history and their use by indigenous people for healing and medicinal purposes may provide guidance for further the study. The discovery of \u201cTaxol\u201d a cytotoxic compound used in cancer therapy is made by both the fungal endophyte and the host plant (pacific yew), and also the discovery of vincristine and vinblastine from fungal endophytes of Catharanthus roseus are good examples of the potential bioactive compounds that may be obtained based on plant history. (iii) Communication: Very little, if any, is known about the consequences of fungal/fungal, bacterial/bacterial and fungal/bacterial associations and interactions, especially in planta. In some preliminary studies, it was found that the presence of one or more than one endophytes facilitate the production of bio-active compounds. Obviously, more efforts must be initiated in this area of research to be able to optimally harnessing the potential of endophytes. (iv) Distribution and abundance: Studies have shown that in some systems, the presence of endophytes is ubiquitous while in some systems very few endophytes colonize the tissues such as roots and stems. So, these studies beg one to as the question of \u201cWhat are the regulatory aspects involved in the differential in vivo and in planta distribution(s) observed?\u201d (v) Production: Aspects affecting the stimulation and subsequent production of bioactive compounds is an important variable to determine. Studies have indicated that the production of compounds is affected by the immediate environment. For example, when grown under in vitro conditions, an endophyte may successfully and constantly produce bioactive materials for a time, after which, production seizes. Additional research addressing the regulatory factors involved is required to determine how to induce the endophytes to produce the compound(s) in a steady fashion for successful commercialization to become a reality.",

It seems that investigators that have started this research in India are still actively involved in advancing their research manifesto with this \u2018under studied\u2019 group of microbes and yet, have not advanced the field significantly. An exception to this statement only a few people are engaged and pursuing their research in this area consistently such as Prof. T. S. Suryanarayanan (Chennai), Prof Umashaankar (Karnataka), T. Amna and Sanjana Kaul (Jammu and Kashmir), Prof. H. S. Prakash, and K. R. Sridhar (Mangalore, Karnataka) and R. N. Kharwar (BHU, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh). Their group is actively searching the various habitats of the countryside in van attempt to investigate microbe/plant associations. They have initiated the biodiversity and distribution patterns of fungal endophytes with some medicinal plants in India and have published several papers along this line. They have also isolated some bioactive compounds from different endophytic fungi inhabited to different hosts. Some other groups have also started research with fungal endophytes, but overall situation in India compared to countries such as China and Brazil, for exploration of bioactive compounds is still minimal. However, recently, several research groups have started displaying more attention and efforts towards the potential importance of endophytic microbes, especially fungi. About two dozen research groups throughout India are presently engaged in vigorous studies centered on biodiversity and hence natural products discovery from this untapped alternative resource. It has become apparent to many researchers that endophytic microbes have enormous potential for addressing and solving many problems of mankind. With the discovery of new compounds, collectively as a society, we may find new options to protect our interests in agriculture, medicine and nanotechnology. Actually, the status of total published work by Indian researchers hardly approaching up to hundred, which shows a small representative potential of the possibilities that exists in this realm of study. If serious efforts were to be explored in India, with its vast and enormous plant diversity, and/or worldwide with all the collective habitat potentials, it boggles the mind in the possibilities we as scientists may unravel. As such, studies of this nature truly need to be supported not only by the scientific community, but society at large that will surely reap the benefits.",

The bioactive compounds to be obtained that are of interest are those that have activity against important plant and human pathogens/parasites (such as those causing malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy and encephalitis, etc.,), which have either become drug resistant, and/or lack drug treatment (i.e., AIDS). In recent years, India has experienced an increase in AIDS and immuno-compromised patients. A search for safe and effective drugs to enhance the resistance capacity of patients would be of great benefit and add quality to life. Discovery of novel antimicrobials against disease that can be used as weapons against virulent pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis would be greatly beneficial. Unfortunately, in recent times, a high incidence of scientifically advanced and remote-operated terrorist activities in countries like India, USA, UK, Germany, USSR and France is a reality that needs to be urgently addressed. Required are the developments of compounds that can effectively nullify the potential adverse effect of biochemical attacks. Yet another concern is the inordinately huge population in India (more than one billion strong), all who require a safe, reliable food source for sustenance. Such goals may only be achieved once production of disease free crops is obtainable. Management of human fecal matter is yet another alarming issue if left unmanaged will result in unhygienic and potentially lethal conditions, especially in slums and localities of poorer people. India unfortunately is still suffering from several severe human diseases (tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy, etc.,) that have been successfully eradicated from other \u201cfirst world\u201d countries. One of the primary reasons these disease persist is due to the development of disease resistance in these microorganisms against particular drug(s). Therefore, to overcome these problems, India as well as the world in general, needs to obtain a variety of novel antimicrobial compounds from biological sources to begin to address these serious issues. In general, fungi as a group hold enormous potential as a promising source of antimicrobials and tool for nanotechnology. Our studies indicate that this group of organisms reside inside healthy plant tissue (endophytes) without causing any detectable symptoms, and are capable of producing powerful natural bioactive compounds, biofules and nanomaterials. Therefore, we strongly feel that India, as well as the world, needs to make serious efforts to address the potential of endophytes for isolation and synthesis of natural products, biofuel and nanoparticles, and in so doing, help facilitate the development of options and ultimately, the rescue of humanity from annihilation.",

The presence of endophytes was observed from algae to angiosperm studied till date. As per studies made world wide, endophytes augment resistance in their hosts against herbivores, pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, nematodes illness, reduced seed production, temperature and salinity and also against drought and minerals as well. The day by day development of drug resistance to pathogenic forms of bacteria, fungi and other microbes, emergence of lethal viruses, the perpetuating epidemics in developing and under developing countries, and multifold fungal infection, enhancement in human population globally, all shows our inability to overcome these biomedical related problems. In addition to this, we are also unable to assure people towards enough food security in specific regions of the earth and in India too, to support the local human population. Environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and spoilage of land and water also added to the problems facing mankind. The access of new disease causing agents like AIDS, SARS, Ebola and already epidemic like malaria, leismania and encephalitis requires the discovery and development of new therapeutic drugs that target them specifically within the cellular metabolism.",

            "text": "Although many products can be produced synthetically, but natural bioactive products remains as an important alternative used heavily in modern medicine and agricultures. Approximately 60% of the new drugs produced during the period 1985\u20132005 were anticancer, antimigraine and antihypertensive agents derived from either natural products or based on natural products structure. In some instances, endophytic microorganisms have developed the biochemical ability to produce compounds similar or identical to those produced by their host plants as a result of gene recombination during the evolutionary process. Bioactive natural products from endophytic microbes have enormous potential as a source for novel medicinal and agricultural product development. Thus, there is an urgent need to facilitate the identity of appropriate natural products and the subsequent development of drugs based on them. Such needs add further credence to the importance of the need to preserve natural habitats, and in so doing, preserve plant and endophyte biodiversity. A concerted effort involving multiple organizations needs to be spearheaded in order to begin the daunting task of collection and cataloguing of endophytic microorganisms throughout the world. A better understanding of the biosynthetic pathways involved in the production of bioactive endophytic compounds by chemical and biochemical means is essential. Recent progress in the field of molecular biology of secondary metabolites has given us better insights about how the genes encoding for these bioactive compounds are organized. Investigation of these microorganisms and their relationship to the host requires improved quantitative analysis.",

Several fungal endophytes have been identified and used as potential microbes for biosynthesis (Green Synthesis) of various metals nanoparticles with different properties.
