Hemodialysis was performed immediately when the postoperative serum potassium level was >6 mEq/L. For patients on maintenance hemodialysis, the hemodialysis was scheduled to be performed the day before surgery, postoperative day 1 or 2, and then three times per week thereafter. If pulmonary edema was suspected, continuous hemodiafiltration was immediately performed. Potassium canrenoate was routinely administered to reduce ascitic fluid drainage in patients with normal renal function [3, 17]; however, this drug was administered with caution in RD patients while checking the serum potassium or creatinine level to avoid hyperkalemia or exacerbation of renal function. The ascitic fluid drainage volume was measured daily. Patients with normal renal function and RD patients not requiring maintenance hemodialysis received a fluid infusion of 40 mL/kg/day (patients with liver cirrhosis) or 45 mL/kg/day (patients without liver cirrhosis) [3, 17]. The total fluid infusion volume was restricted as follows in patients under hemodialysis to avoid pulmonary edema: total fluid infusion = urinary output + ascitic fluid drainage and pleural effusion aspirated volumes + insensible water loss. Ascitic fluid collection included discharge from the thoracic tube, abdominal tube, and gauze oozing. Insensible water loss was calculated as 12 mL/kg/day.",

Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall survival curves were determined using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. A multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression and backward elimination procedure; P < 0.10 was set as the cut-off value for elimination. Because we used the backward elimination procedure, the multivariate analysis was independently executed. The following 10 variables were examined as potential risk factors for postoperative pleural effusion and major complication: a positive serum test for the hepatitis C virus antibody, Child-Pugh class B, platelet count <10 \u00d7 104 cells/\u03bcL, 15-min indocyanine green retention rate >15%, liver cirrhosis, blood loss >500 mL, operative time >300 min, intraoperative red blood cell transfusion, serum albumin <3.5 g/dL, and eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

In the RD group, two patients died due to the rapid recurrence of tumor, while one due to pneumonia. Two patients in each group, including the 90-day mortality evaluation, died during hospitalization.

A remarkably high incidence of pleural effusion and mortality rate were observed in RD and Child-Pugh B patients. The median eGFR values in Child-Pugh A patients with RD decreased from postoperative day 7 (37.8 mL/min/1.73 m2) to days 14 (33.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) and recovered to a preoperative level (36.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) between days 30 (35.3 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 90 (37.4 mL/min/1.73 m2). None of the Child-Pugh A patients with RD developed postoperative acute kidney failure requiring emergent hemodialysis. In RD with Child-Pugh B group, two patients needed hemodialysis postoperatively. Univariate analysis of pleural effusion is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Multivariate analysis carried out to determine risk factors for postoperative pleural effusion identified an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (risk ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.32\u20134.70; P = 0.0063) as significant independent risk factors (Table 4). We also performed univariate (Supplementary Table 1) and multivariate analyses (Table 4) for major complication. Blood loss >500 mL, an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and hepatitis C virus infection were found to be the independent risk factors for major complication in multivariate analysis.\n\n",

The number of patients with RD was significantly smaller than patients without RD, and the results may have been biased because of limited statistical power. Furthermore, the number of Child-Pugh B patients with RD was extremely small (n = 9), which may have affected the statistical significance. Another limitation of this study is the low rate of laparoscopic liver resection (3.0%), which reportedly decreases the rate of postoperative ascites and shortens hospital stay [27\u201329]. Thus, our proposal of surgical indication needs validation at centers where laparoscopic liver resections are more frequently performed. The impact of RD on outcomes after liver resection has been reported in eight studies [4\u20137, 30\u201333]. Of these, four studies deduced that RD itself was not a surgical contraindication, whereas one study suggested the need for careful patient selection. In the present study, we first revealed that preoperative RD had an important impact on the postoperative outcome, especially in Child-Pugh B patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest single-institution series of liver resections for HCC patients with RD and impaired liver function. Further studies are needed using large registry databases.",
