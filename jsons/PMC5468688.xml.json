In this context, zoonotic diseases, emerging or re-emerging as public health problems at the people\u2013wildlife\u2013livestock interface, have become a major focus of scientific and policy attention.

These cases were chosen because, in common, the diseases all require persistent animal reservoir host(s) and zoonotic spillover to cause human disease (unlike viruses of longer zoonotic origin such as HIV/AIDS); yet they involve contrasting transmission routes, ecosystem types and environmental\u2013livelihood dynamics, facilitating a fuller and more comparative understanding. The modes of animal\u2013human transmission considered cover those that are direct (from bats in the case of henipavirus, rodents in the case of Lassa fever and domestic livestock in the case of RVF) and indirect, via insect vectors (mosquitoes in the case of RVF and tsetse flies in the case of trypanosomiasis). The cases also involve a range of non-human vertebrate hosts (both wild and domestic) and degrees of reliance on them. Case study sites are located across ecological zones associated with rainfall gradients and dominant vegetation types, from semi-arid savannah in Kenya, through wooded miombo savannah in Zambia and Zimbabwe and forest\u2013savannah transition in Sierra Leone, to humid forest in Ghana (figure 1). The cases therefore enable a comparative exploration of a range of disease\u2013ecosystem dynamics. The case studies also represent different local contexts of people\u2013livelihood\u2013ecosystem interaction, from a rural and urban contrast in Ghana for the henipavirus case; a village\u2013garden\u2013farm landscape in Sierra Leone for the Lassa case; a contrast between a dry pastoral rangeland and irrigated agriculture in Kenya for the RVF case; and an ecotone between plateau and valley, correlated with changing agricultural and wildlife dynamics in Zambia and Zimbabwe for the trypanosomiasis case.\n",

It can also be transmitted to people through the body fluids of infected animals. Outbreaks occur episodically every 5\u201315 years following periods of above-normal precipitation, often associated with the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) weather phenomenon [5]. The virus (RVFv) is thought to be maintained during the inter-epidemic periods in eggs of infected Aedes mosquitoes, which can survive for several years in dry soil [6] but require heavy rainfall and/or floods to emerge. Ecosystem change, particularly the introduction of flood irrigation and dams in areas that already harbour RVFv, is thus likely to provide conditions for RVFv occurrence and endemicity.",

Both primary and secondary vectors of RVFv, including Aedes mcintoshi, Ae. ochraceus, Ae. tricholabis and Culex pipiens, were sampled in the irrigated farms. Multivariate models fitted to the data showed that controlling for season and humidity, the irrigated farms had significantly higher densities of mosquitoes than the pastoral areas (table 1). The study also demonstrated that drainage canals in the irrigated area supported the breeding of many mosquito species. When these mosquitoes were screened for arboviruses using standard molecular characterization techniques, eight Ndumu viruses were identified.

Overall, the median percentages and the 10th and 90th percentile of households that were classified under poor, moderate and rich categories were 56% (15.0\u201388%), 29.5% (10\u201361) and 12.5% (2\u201330%), respectively. This trend was consistent across sites. Notably, however, irrigated areas had a much higher proportion of households in the \u2018poor\u2019 category compared to the other sites (74% compared with 38.5% in agro-pastoral and 56.5% in pastoral areas). This could reflect the importance of livestock ownership as a local signifier of wealth, and its absence in the irrigated areas\u2014as well as the high proportion of people in the irrigated areas working as relatively low-paid or casual labourers.",

Cotton production has become widespread along with other forms of cultivation with resultant changes in land cover. As the distribution of tsetse species is largely determined by climatic and environmental factors such as temperature, vegetation cover and availability of vertebrate hosts, these changes could have a profound impact on tsetse populations and trypanosomiasis transmission. Similarly, changes in human demographics and behaviour could result in many more people becoming at risk of infection with HAT. Areas such as this where livestock have recently been introduced and where they exist at the interface with wildlife and tsetse populations have been identified as being at particular risk of epidemics [10].

First, there are the Korekore people, who still engage in foraging and hunting, with some moving into agriculture. Second, there are long-term migrants, attracted to Hurungwe by land and firewood for commodity production [20]. These migrants dominate the production of tobacco and cotton, threatening Korekore land control [21]. Third, there are \u2018squatters\u2019, a disparate group seeing Hurungwe as a refuge\u2014whether fleeing the state, displaced from commercial crop farming areas or retrenched from mining towns following the collapse of the economy. Whatever their origin, squatters are very poor and vulnerable.",

Previous studies have shown that the rodent is most abundant in villages and surrounding backyard gardens, rather than in more distant farmland or forest [31,32]. Few studies have identified an age- or gender-associated risk for LF [33\u201336], yet research has not been fine grained and suffers from poor incidence and prevalence data. Exposure to the virus is believed to occur through contact with rodent urine/faecal contamination of food, water and surfaces. Most speculation about Lassa exposure has centred on rodent\u2013human interactions in and around homes, while the only recognized rodent-associated risk factor for LF is hunting of rodents for food consumption [37]. However, in Sierra Leone, reported LF incidence fluctuates seasonally, with peaks in the dry season (February\u2013March) and a smaller peak in the rainy season (June/July) [36], suggesting that climatological factors and agricultural labour patterns may impact rodent\u2013human contact. Anthropological literature from the region suggests that exposure in homes and agricultural activity could be differentiated by gendered and age-specific labour and livelihood activities [38], and that villagers prefer to consume \u2018bush\u2019 rather than \u2018town\u2019 rodents [39]. This raises the likelihood of differentiated but widespread exposure to LF shaped by livelihood-related ecosystem interactions beyond the village.",

The 37 Military Hospital is situated in the centre of Accra near a transport terminal, and people living and working there are from a mixture of ethnic groups. Large numbers of fruit bats roost on mahogany trees along the main road in front of the hospital and within the hospital compound, thus exposing patients, hospital visitors and the general public using the transport terminal to bat urine and faeces. Bat roosts could also be found on trees in residential areas and on the grounds of the Parks and Gardens department located near the hospital. The Tano sacred grove is located in Tanoboase, a small farming community along the Techiman\u2013Kintampo road in the Brong-Ahafo Region, dominated by people speaking the Bono version of Akan, but also with migrants from the north of the country speaking other languages. Sacred groves are patches of forest set aside by local communities and protected by traditional norms for a variety of religious and sociocultural purposes [58]. The site is estimated to support over 2 million bats during the peak season. The inhabitants are mainly small-holder farmers cultivating food and cash crops such as yam, maize, plantain and cashew. Ve-Golokuati, whose people are primarily Ewe, is located along the Tema\u2013Jasikan Road, within the forest\u2013savannah transition zone.

These dynamics involve diverse, interacting temporal scales. Thus, in the case of trypanosomiasis in both Zambia and Zimbabwe, a timescale of several decades has seen the transformation of wooded miombo savannah to farmed landscapes with reduced tsetse fly prevalence. A similar timescale in semi-arid Kenya has seen a major expansion of irrigated land, increasing the prevalence of RVF-transmitting mosquitoes. Demographic changes (increasing populations and in-migration) have been important drivers of land use change in all these cases, as have been the expansion of commercial farming and cash-cropping.",

However, changes within this continuity include the expansion of small-scale horticulture (in Sierra Leone) and tree cropping (in both Ghana and Sierra Leone), and the growth of towns and peri-urban landscapes. In different ways both trends have increased the availability of peri-domestic habitats for disease-carrying rodents and bats.",

Several of the case study diseases show both endemic patterns of continuous spillover, combined with outbreaks, which in turn can be related to sudden or episodic ecosystem changes. Thus RVF outbreaks are associated with episodes of above-normal rainfall linked to El Ni\u00f1o cycles. Outbreaks of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Lassa fever, as well as Ebola) have elsewhere been associated with exceptionally sudden-onset dry season conditions, although our study timescales were insufficient to identify such outbreak dynamics in the case studies themselves. Conducted over a 2\u20133 year timescale, however, the case studies have been able to reveal seasonal changes in the prevalence of animal disease reservoirs and vectors. Both the Zimbabwe and Zambia study sites have one rainy season with quite pronounced seasonal effects on both tsetse and wildlife populations. In Kenya, populations of RVF-carrying mosquito populations vary annually across the seasonal cycle, while in the case of Sierra Leone, rodent habitats shift with seasonal cycles of upland farm\u2013fallow and swamp rice\u2013vegetable garden dynamics. Notably, in these latter cases the key seasonal dynamics with respect to disease depend on seasonally varying agricultural and agro-pastoral land use as well as climate.",

Within each, though, spatial dynamics are a key part of the unfolding story of ecosystem\u2013animal\u2013disease interactions. In Zambia, these relate mainly to land use differentials along a gradient in altitude; in Zimbabwe, to the patch dynamics of woodland amidst agro-pastoral land use; in semi-arid Kenya, to contrasts between irrigated commercially farmed areas, and those dominated by rangelands; and in Ghana and Sierra Leone, to the location and size of settlements, and patches of different types of land use within shifting mosaics, in ecological settings where rodents and bats occupy peri-domestic spaces.

The case studies reveal a wide array of ecosystem interactions that are central to people's livelihoods and well-being. Shaped by varied political economies and social relations, and with local variation in the resources available, valued and used, these include pastoralism and agro-pastoralism (Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia); commercial and subsistence farming (all cases); hunting (all cases); and the collection of food, firewood and medicines (all cases). As the examples of sacred forests in Ghana and pilgrimage sites in Zimbabwe illustrate, particular sites within ecosystems are also visited as part of cultural and ritual practices. Everyday living and movement in a settlement or landscape, for social and non-directly ecosystem-dependent livelihood purposes such as trade, can also bring people into contact with pathogen-carrying animals\u2014as in the cases of bat roosts in Ghana and Lassa-carrying rodents in Sierra Leonean villages. While revealing the multiplicity and diversity of livelihood-related ecosystem interactions, however, the cases also point to significant social differences in livelihood profiles and ecosystem use, which in turn can suggest particular, socially differentiated vulnerabilities to disease. The examples of women gardeners\u2019 vulnerability to Lassa fever, or the vulnerability of squatters and hunters drawn to tsetse-inhabited woodland patches to trypanosomiasis in Zimbabwe, exemplify the broader point that \u2018who gets sick and why\u2019 depends on social and livelihood difference as these intersect with ecologies [63].",

            "text": "A close understanding of the interactions between ecosystem, livelihood and disease dynamics in turn reveals synergies, but also tensions and potential trade-offs, between patterns of system change that are positive in terms of ecosystems, of livelihoods and of disease. For instance in Zambia and Zimbabwe, landscape transformation for commercial farming has been synergistic with a reduction of trypanosomiasis risk. The retention and use of woodland patches is vital for some people's livelihoods\u2014but brings the trade-off of tsetse exposure. In Kenya, irrigation has brought commercial agricultural profits and employment, at least to some people; but it has also enhanced RVF transmission. In Sierra Leone, dry season vegetable gardening is a vital addition to women's livelihoods and economic independence, but also exposes them to Lassa fever. In Ghana, the use of bats for bushmeat is a valuable source of livelihood and well-being for many people\u2014but also brings disease risk. Such synergies and trade-offs can be helpfully clarified in the concepts and language of ecosystem services [64,65]. People interact with and make use of a variety of ecosystem services in the course of their lives and livelihoods, which may be provisioning, regulating, supporting or cultural services. Yet in so doing, they may also experience the \u2018ecosystem disservice\u2019 of disease. Interventions that enhance some ecosystem services may also increase the ecosystem disservice of disease risk (as in irrigation which enhances the service of hydrological regulation, but increases the disservice of RVF transmission). Disease regulation can also be conceptualized as an ecosystem service; framed thus, the land-use changes in the RVF case, for instance, can be seen to have reduced the wildlife and dryland vegetation conditions that kept RVF transmission to people and livestock at a relatively low level, and irrigation has disrupted such disease regulation.",

Thus addressing Lassa fever in Sierra Leone, our analysis suggests, could benefit from joined-up thinking and action between health and agricultural practitioners, in identifying potential solutions that link disease control with the management of rodents as agricultural pests.
