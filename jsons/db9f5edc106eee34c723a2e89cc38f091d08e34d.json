Based on genome sequencing followed by sequence alignment and sequence similarity analysis, researchers have characterized the evolutionary patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and postulated its origins. Theories of bat origin [4] [5] [6] and pangolin origin [7, 8] emerged and even the snake plays an intermediate role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [9] . Many other similar studies and results are not exhaustively listed here at all. In a word, it seems that the continuous change of theories on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 even exceeds the evolution rate of the virus itself. It seems that several results appear to be encouraging. For example, a recent paper by Tang et al. [10] has taken advantage of RNA-seq data. By traditional mutation calling pipeline, the authors discovered two lineages (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2, and claimed that the L type is more virulent than S type based on their frequency among the population. This might be a typical bioinformatic study that informs us of the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 population and evolution. The 'snake' paper [9] also emphasized the important fact that viruses adapt to the host expression system, so that their codon content should adapt to the host environment. No matter whether the final conclusion is correct or not, the main contribution is that the associated terminologies like relative synonymous codon usage and codon adaptation index are nicely incorporated in the relevant studies, indicating a correlation between the codon content of host and parasite.",

The classic theories, principles and formula of evolutionary biology are based on the central dogma, which assumes the DNA-to-RNA-to-protein chain. The basic notion is that the mutations on DNA could be inherited rather than the modifications on RNA. For example, despite the numerous types of RNA modifications in higher eukaryotes, these organisms do not suffer from extraordinarily high mutation rates because the modified RNAs could not be transmitted to the next generation. However, for RNA viruses, their RNA is actually their genetic information. Whether the evolutionary principles could be applied to RNA viruses should be seriously debated. The host cells have multiple RNA modification systems/enzymes. The changes in viral RNA (by host cells) would permanently change its genetic information and be transmitted to the next 'generation', which is similar to genetic mutations in higher organisms. Technically, one could not distinguish genetic mutations and RNA modifications from the RNA-sequencing data of RNA viruses. So, what is the point of detecting positive/negative selection based on the mutations in the virus population? These mutations are possibly conferred by the host cell's RNA modification systems. How could the randomly occurring RNA modification events have preference on missense or synonymous sites?",

The authors concluded that only the neutral evolving sites should be considered rather than all different sites. Let us assume that both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 undergo the RNA modification by host cells, and the modified viral RNA is inheritable, then their sequence (SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13) could become quite different within a short time scale. The divergence time is calculated as t = dS/2u. When dS might be largely contributed by the RNA modification system of host cells, this estimation could be inaccurate. In the dN and dS calculation, it is necessary to rule out any mismatch sites that might be produced by RNA modification. They should at least mention why they should or should not consider this factor. And then, the mutation rate 'u', how to define 'u'? Does 'u' include the nucleotide changes conferred by the host's modification enzymes? Therefore, the authors' logic chain is questionable.",

The mutation rate is largely connected with the fidelity of DNA replication. The next step is the natural selection force acting on these mutations, after which the deleterious mutations are purged and those beneficial mutations are maintained. However, RNA viruses either undergo the reverse-transcription process (like HIV) or the RNA replication process (like SARS-CoV-2). For RNA viruses, every newly transcribed RNA molecule is a potential offspring of the original virus. The mismatches introduced during reverse transcription or RNA replication would be maintained and kept in the offspring. Before applying the evolutionary formula to RNA viruses, one should state whether RNA replication has similar mismatching rates as DNA replication. Intuitively, DNA-DNA pairing (DNA replication), DNA-RNA pairing (transcription) and RNA-RNA pairing (such as RNA replication) should have different mismatching rates. Thus, when applying theories to SARS-CoV-2, should the authors consider the potentially different mutation rates during the reverse transcription or RNA replication processes? Take the paper by Tang et al. [10] for instance, what exactly does mutation rate 'u' refer to? Even the problem of technically indistinguishable RNA modification and the 'de novo' RNA mutation is not mentioned by the authors at all, let alone the mutations introduced during the RNA replication process. At least, the authors could briefly introduce the reproduction mode of SARS-CoV-2 rather than 'mechanically' apply the formula to an organism which they are not familiar with.",

The same goes for the negative-strand RNA generated by the positive-strand RNA during the RNA replication. So that the DNA/negative-strand RNA and any changes on it could not be directly transferred to the next host cell. However, if a DNA intermediate could transcribe N RNA molecules, and a mutation takes place when N/2 RNA molecules have been transcribed, then only part of the offspring would have this mutation. All these random processes could not be predicted by any algorithms. How could theories on DNA mutations be applied to a transiently existing DNA intermediate or negative-strand RNA?",
