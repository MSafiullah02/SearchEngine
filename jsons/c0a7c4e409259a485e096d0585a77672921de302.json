In children respiratory viruses have been detected by molecular diagnostic techniques in 43e67% of cases of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 5 over 90% of infants with bronchiolitis, 6 and approximately 85% of asthma exacerbations. 7 In adults approximately 20e40% of CAP cases, 8e12 50e70% of asthma exacerbations 13 and 30e50% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations 14 are associated with respiratory virus detection. In hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness, viruses are the most commonly detectable pathogen (being detected in around 50%) with bacterial detection being much less frequent, although antibiotic use is almost universal. 4 Furthermore, preceding viral infection is thought to be a key predisposing event to secondary bacterial infections in the lung and other sites in the respiratory tract. 15e17 Respiratory viruses including influenza have also been implicated in precipitating non-respiratory illnesses such as myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke and loss of diabetic control. 18e22 Infections with respiratory viruses are frequent events in all age groups and result in an enormous burden on health systems as well as the economic costs in direct medical expenses and indirect productivity losses. Direct medical expenses include outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, hospitalisations and treatment costs, including over-the-counter medication and drug prescriptions. Indirect productivity losses include missed workdays for adult patients and caregivers. In Europe direct costs attributed to pneumonia are estimated at approximately V10.1 billion annually and indirect costs of lost work days at V3.6 billion. 23 Based on the 2003 population size, seasonal influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost, 3.1 million hospital days and 31.4 million outpatient visits in the USA. 24 Direct medical costs averaged US$10.4 billion annually, and projected lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to US$16.3 billion annually. The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to US$87.1 billion. 25 The common cold also causes a significant economic burden with a US-based study estimating that non-influenza, viral respiratory tract illnesses (mostly common colds) cost around US$40 billion in 2001. 26 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 424, "end": 425, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 473, "end": 474, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 556, "end": 558, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 625, "end": 627, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 909, "end": 910, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1292, "text": "18e22", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1941, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2132, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2412, "end": 2414, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2617, "end": 2619, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Respiratory viruses: clinical and economic burden of disease"}, {"text": "The influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics leading to excess hospitalisations and death mainly in the elderly and in patients with co-morbidity. 27, 28 It causes severe illness in up to 5 million people and around half a million deaths per year worldwide. 29 Annual seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended in at risk groups 30 however vaccine uptake is sub-optimal 31,32 and high quality evidence for significant protection in the elderly is lacking. 33, 34 The rate of hospitalisation in adults with influenza has been estimated at 5 to 20 per 100,000 overall 35, 36 and may be as high as 1200 per 100,000 in those over 85 years old. 37 In adults hospitalised with laboratory confirmed influenza, 10e30% are admitted to critical care units and 3e15% die in hospital, 38, 39 with outcomes being predicted by co-morbidity. 40 As noted above, in addition to acute respiratory presentations, influenza may precipitate decompensated cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, collapse or diabetic emergencies 20e22,41 and so many hospitalised cases of influenza are likely to remain undiagnosed.

PCR is highly sensitive and specific but generally has a turnaround time of at least 24 h and requires specialist laboratory facilities and expertise. 54, 55 Rapid antigen detection tests for respiratory viruses There are several commercially available FDA approved and CE marked, rapid diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses including influenza and RSV, which use antigen detection by either immune-chromatographic assay or immunofluorescence. Time to result is generally around fifteen minutes, they are easy to use and do not require laboratory support, and generally involve visual inspection of a test line (in addition to a control line). Unfortunately the clinical utility of rapid antigen based detection for respiratory viruses has been limited by their unacceptably poor sensitivity, especially in adults where it is around 50% for influenza 56 and lower for RSV, 57 meaning that they cannot be used to rule out infection. The Sofia Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) is a benchtop analyser that combines lateral flow immunofluorescence-based antigen detection test kits with an optical sensor and provides a result in around 10 min. Test kits are available for influenza and RSV which are both FDA approved and CE marked. Sensitivity for detection of influenza is around 80% compared to PCR and so may be higher than for some other rapid antigen tests. 58 Although it has not been evaluated in adults, in children the sensitivity for detection of RSV was around 70% compared to PCR but would be expected to be lower in adults. 59 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 245, "end": 248, "text": "50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 249, "end": 251, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 806, "end": 808, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1054, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1058, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1061, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1553, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1556, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2255, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2794, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2966, "end": 2968, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Other respiratory viruses"}, {"text": "MariPOC (ArcDia Laboratories, Turku, Finland) is a CE marked, multi-analyte immunofluorescence-based antigen detection platform that can simultaneously detect 8 respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, RSV, adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3) in addition to Streptococcus pneumonia.

The associated slow turnaround times mean that results are only available to clinicians many hours to several days after the patient has presented, and long after antimicrobial decisions have been made, perpetuating the current paradigm of empirical antimicrobial use rather than pathogen directed use. The Infectious Diseases Society of America policy paper 'Better Tests, Better Care: Improved Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases' acknowledges the ongoing culture of empirical antimicrobial use and the unmet need for rapid accurate tests for infectious diseases to allow appropriate pathogen directed therapy. 79 The Wold Economic Forum has stated that antimicrobial resistance is the arguably the greatest threat to global human health and current high profile initiatives on combating resistance have focused attention on antimicrobial stewardship, which seeks to preserve existing antimicrobial agents and slow the development of resistance. One of the strategies to achieve this goal is the development of rapid diagnostic tests and biomarkers to ensure appropriate use of antimicrobials so that antimicrobial use is pathogen directed rather than empirical and only used in those where there is clear evidence of benefit. 80, 81 In addition the increasing recognition of the huge global burden of respiratory viruses has led to the creation of the WHO's global Battle against Respiratory Viruses Initiative (BRaVe) initiative which aims to improve research into strategies to prevent, diagnose and manage respiratory virus infection.

The impact of respiratory virus testing in adult outpatients with acute respiratory illness was assessed in a small randomised controlled trial using laboratory-based PCR. Results were available the next day in those randomised to viral PCR testing and even with this delay antibiotic prescribing was significantly reduced compared to those treated with standard care (5% vs 12%). 93 As noted above the FilmArray respiratory platform has been clinically evaluated in a single centre paediatric study where the platform was not used as a POCT but was housed within the central laboratory. Although not a randomised controlled trial it demonstrated reductions in antibiotic use in those testing positive for viruses with the FilmArray versus standard laboratory PCR, although only when results were available within 4 h, underscoring the importance of rapid results and suggesting possible further reductions if the platform was used as a POCT. 71 A recent Cochrane review evaluating the use of rapid viral diagnostics for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the emergency department concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to support rapid viral testing to reduce antibiotic use in this setting. The authors have suggested an adequately powered trial with antibiotic use as the primary outcome measure. 94 Directed antiviral agent use Influenza The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) Oseltamivir and Zanamivir are licensed antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza and are recommend by UK Public Health England for the treatment of hospitalised adults with suspected and confined influenza A and B. 95 Although there has been controversy regarding the evidence for their efficacy from the original pharma sponsored trials, there is now a large body of evidence from observational studies suggesting a significant reduction in mortality in hospitalised adults with confirmed influenza. 96 Although the degree of benefit from NAIs is probably greatest when they are started with 48 h of symptom onset there is evidence in adults to suggest ongoing benefit when started beyond this time and up to 5 days of symptoms. 96, 97 This is particularly pertinent as patients infected with influenza often present to hospital after 48 h of symptom duration. 4 In current UK practise patients with suspected influenza are generally treated empirically with NAI whilst awaiting the results of laboratory PCR testing. 95 This strategy leads to unnecessary NAI exposure with the associated risk of side effects in patients who are subsequently found not to have influenza. Following the recent publication of the independent meta-analysis of oseltamivir trials, 98 an editorial letter (published in the Lancet) suggested that, in view of the modest efficacy and moderate risk of nausea and vomiting with oseltamivir, the administration of this drug should ideally be directed with the use of diagnostic tests rather than used empirically. 99 The use of a molecular point-of-care test has the potential to allow implementation of directed rather than empirical NAI treatment thus maximising clinical benefit for those with influenza infection and minimising unnecessary antiviral exposure and drug related adverse events in those without.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 495, "end": 497, "text": "86", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 753, "end": 755, "text": "87", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1532, "text": "93", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 2092, "end": 2094, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2480, "end": 2482, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 2787, "end": 2789, "text": "95", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 3073, "end": 3075, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 3302, "end": 3305, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 3306, "end": 3308, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3435, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3591, "end": 3593, "text": "95", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 4111, "end": 4113, "text": "99", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential clinical benefits of point-of-care testing Reduction in antibiotic use"}, {"text": "As noted above several studies in children and a single study in adults have suggested improved use of NAIs using rapid antigen testing for influenza versus routine clinical care 87e92 although there have been no studies evaluating molecular platform POCTs with this outcome measure.

A study using decision analytic modelling to ascertain the most cost effective testing strategy in children presenting to the emergency department with influenza-like illness suggested that rapid PCR using the FilmArray respiratory panel was superior to standard laboratory PCR or rapid antigen testing. However the incremental costs per QALY were high and many questionable assumptions about the effects of diagnosing a respiratory virus infection on investigations, antibiotic and antiviral use were made. 114 Another study using health economic modelling evaluated the cost effectiveness of PCR based rapid diagnostics (Cepheid Xpert Flu assay) for the diagnosis of influenza in high risk adults presenting to the emergency department.

These effects could be associated with an overall health economic benefit. There is a substantial evidence gap and high quality randomised controlled trials evaluating molecular POCTs in adults and using clinically relevant outcomes such as antibiotic use, directed antiviral use and infection control facility use are urgently needed. In addition to the existing agents active against influenza there may soon also be available a range of clinically effective antiviral agents active against other respiratory viruses such as RSV and rhinovirus.
