A complete influenza genome consists of eight independent gene segments, where the subtype of influenza is characterized by the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [1]. Transcription and replication take place by the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) and polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) [2]. The rest of the segments encode the nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein (M1), ion channel protein (M2) and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). This structure of the virus allows for the exchange of eight RNA segments between influenza viruses coinfecting a cell [3]. The process of genetic recombination, named reassortment, may lead to the emergence of novel progeny viruses [4].",

The reassortment could accelerate the rate of acquiring new genetic markers that would faster overcome host barriers than the slow process of incremental accumulation of mutations [5]. Three of the four major influenza pandemics occurred since the 19th century were due to the reassortment that produced new strains infecting humans [6]. The evidence indicated that the HA and NA segments of the 1957 Asian pandemic were replaced by gene segments related to avian strains. The reassortment of human and avian strains with an H3 HA gene derived from avian-origin viruses led to the 1968 H3N2 pandemic [7]. In addition, reassortment between two different swine influenza viruses, which themselves contained genes from previous human, swine and avian influenza strains, caused another pandemic in 2009 [8]. These pandemics have not only killed numerous people but also led to enormous economic losses. Therefore, early identification of influenza reassortment and potential reassortant strains are crucial for the surveillance and prevention of pandemics in the future.",

            "text": "With the rapid growth of flu data in recent years, increasing complete influenza genomes are publicly available [9]. There is little concern about the acquisition and interpretation of the data. Many efforts have been made to detect influenza reassortment events using the influenza genomic data. The common approach of identifying influenza reassortment is to construct fixed phylogenetic trees relating each segment of the strains [10\u201312]. Two methods were proposed for identifying reassortment events based on the difference between phylogenetic trees or tree subsets [13]. These trees are compared to detect disagreements of different strains, but it is a laborious and time-consuming process. Moreover, it provides no guarantee that all reassortments have been found. To account for the uncertainty in the inferred phylogenies, a novel computational method named GiRaF was developed to identify reassortment [14]. In GiRaF, large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampled trees were searched for groups of incompatible splits by a fast biclique enumeration algorithm. This successfully detected some known reassortments in avian, human and swine influenza strains. Yurovsky and Moret presented a fully automated flu reassortment finder called FluRF that employed a bottom-up search on the reconstructed phylogenetic trees of full and segment-based genomes [15]. However, the computational cost of phylogeny laid a formidable barrier for reassortment detection using phylogenetic analysis with a large scale of the dataset. Silva et al. aimed to solve this problem by formulating a phylogeny independent method that only utilized nucleotide distance matrices as input for reassortment detection [16]. Furthermore, Rabadan et al. provided a quantitative method to measure the genetic shift from nucleotide sequence data that did not rely on phylogenetic analysis for reassortment detection [17]. Villa and L\u00e4ssig determined rate and average selective effect of reassortment process in human influenza H3N2 using a new method to map reassortment events from joint genealogies of multiple genome segments [18]. Eng et al. developed an influenza reassortment simulation tool through host tropism protein signatures [19]. This program computationally simulates reassortment between the eight viral segments and then generates a list of all possible reassortant progeny based on the signatures.",

In particular, none of the existing approaches scale well to large datasets in detecting all reassortants. In this paper, we develop a novel approach named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment) that employs machine learning techniques to calculate the reassortment probability by predicting the host tropism in a given collection of genomic sequences. HopPER first generates the feature vectors by seven physicochemical properties of amino acids from influenza sequences of three major hosts (avian, human, swine) with global descriptors CTD (Composition, Transition and Distribution). It then applies a kernel perspective on host probability estimation by the random forest [20] for a single sequence and then combines all segments of the genome to produce an overall estimation of reassortment probability. We tested HopPER on both real datasets and synthetic datasets to evaluate the capacity of estimating the reassortment possibility of genomes. HopPER is compared with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show that HopPER has successfully identified reassortments with high precision.Furthermore, HopPER is efficient in detecting reassortment for even incomplete genomes (with at least two available genomic segments) and in analyzing large datasets. We hope HopPER can assist flu surveillance and prevent future pandemics.",

As far as we know, the reassortant strains are responsible for the majority of flu pandemics in history and will continuously threaten public health. While any exchange of genetic material between different influenza viral RNA segments can be considered as reassortment. In this paper, we mainly focus on identifying interspecies reassortments that have occurred across hosts. It is similar to definitions of host tropism predictors in the literature, except that here the problem is formulated probabilistically to enable a quantified estimate of host origin. Hence, host tropism is modelled by quantifying the reassortant probabilities. The model can also detect intra-host reassortments, for instance between different viral strains that have originate from one single host category such as avian. In the model, the actual host in which the mixing occurred is disregarded and the focus is mainly on detecting past reassortants and the potential evolutionary relationships that may be inferred. For all practical purposes, we only use avian, human and swine strains that account for the overwhelming majority of the existing sequence data. The following subsections respectively elaborate the dataset and the structure of the model. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of HopPER.\n",

The effectiveness of host tropism prediction on influenza HA proteins and zoonotic strains prediction has been demonstrated by Eng et al. [19, 27]. Our previous work supplemented this work on the host prediction of human-adapted subtypes using random forest that achieved better results over other classifiers [28]. By constructing a multitude of decision trees, it applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating to tree learners and then splits leaf nodes in the trees by random subset of feature space [20]. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance in the final model [29]. To ensure the robustness of our models, all the datasets are split into independent training dataset and testing dataset with a ratio of 0.8:0.2. We first apply ten-fold cross validation technique to develop our models and evaluate the training process with random forest, and then the independent testing dataset is used to assess the ability of our model in predicting the host tropism of new data. The metrics to evaluate the performance include accuracy, precision, recall, G-means [30] and Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC) [31].",

It supports a heuristic that automatically treats certain sequence items as junk and counts how many times each individual item appears in the sequence. The similarity between a pair of sequences ranges from 0 to 1. We set the threshold of 0.99 to filter the sequences from the training data that are similar to input sequences. The remaining sequences are used to train the host prediction model and construct HopPER. Removal of similar sequences establishes independence of train and test datasets.

Algorithm 1 clarifies the detailed steps of estimating reassortment probability. It not only allows the estimation of reassortment probabilities in complete genomes but also displays effectiveness in incomplete genomes. Random forest probability estimation provides a principled way to view the reassortments in terms of conditional probability functions. Hence, such a problem formulation motivates the discussion of estimation function as a fundamental and quantitative way to predict influenza reassortment. For instance, a prediction that an avian host origin is more likely than human or swine host can narrow the sequence or homology search space for a virologist, given a sequence of interest.\n7\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$ RE^{prob}(g_{i}) = 1 - \\sum_{j=0}^{2} NonRE^{prob}(g_{i})  $$ \\end{document}REprob(gi)=1\u2212\u2211j=02NonREprob(gi)",

We set the true positive value (TPV) in equation (8) to measure the ability of HopPER in reassortant detection. Apart from the detection of reassortment, HopPER can also predict the non-reassortant strains with the same principle. However, as far as we know, the study of non-reassortant strains attract less attention and it is usually difficult to confirm or deny a strain without reassortment. Direct validation of true negative samples by HopPER poses great challenges. As an alternative, we intend to sketch the contours of the distribution of reassortant strains across different years and analyze the rate variation of evolutionary success of viruses generated through reassortment by HopPER. We define the reassortant strain rate (RSR) as the ratio of reassortments that have occurred and the strains reproduced from the past reassortants to total genomic strains, which is a measurement of the subsequent evolutionary success of viruses generated through reassortment. It could be calculated by identifying the reassortant and non-reassortant strains by HopPER. As a result, we could draw the outline of RSR variation by year and analyze the potential evolutionary patterns of the avian, human and swine strains.\n8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document} $$ TPV = \\frac{number\\,of\\,correct\\,predictions} {number\\,of\\,genomes}  $$ \\end{document}TPV=numberofcorrectpredictionsnumberofgenomes",

Genomic sequences for 18 typical reassorted H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 genomes isolated from pigs in North America were studied in Karasin et al. [40\u201342]. The datasets of 16 resembled novel 2009 swine-origin isolates, 6 triple reassortant H3N2 strains throughout Canada and 39 reassortment events in swine influenza strains were constructed from a large-scale whole-genome sequences [43\u201345]. More comprehensively, 36 well supported candidate reassortants [16], 93 single-taxa and multi-taxa reassortment candidates [14, 46] were also selected for validation. A brief description of these genome datasets follows below.\nKarasin et al. investigated the genetic characterization of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 viruses that circulated in North America from 1997 to 2005. Due to the occurrence of influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968, the reassortant human/avian viruses have circulated in the world and been collected from pigs in Europe [47]. After that, the wholly avian H1N1 viruses adapted to the swine population and spread to North America with classical swine influenza virus [48\u201350]. The results obtained by genetic and phylogenetic trees indicated the evidence for wholly human and reassortant virus genotypes.Kingsford et al. dataset contained 16 genome sequences that were similar to swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIV) that appeared in Thailand. These swine-origin isolates only caused one cause of human infection A/Thailand/271/2005 (H1N1). The comparison between these earlier resembled S-OIV reassortant strains and the real S-OIV strains could facilitate identification of reassortment patterns and may shed light on the cause of S-OIV.Olsen et al. dataset contained 6 triple reassortant H3N2 viruses isolated from pigs and turkeys throughout Canada in 2005. These were human classical swine/avian reassortants similar to the viruses in the United States in 1998 except a distinct human-lineage NA segment, which suggested a fast and complicated interspecies transmission of reassortants.Khiabanian et al. dataset was used to explore the process and patterns of viral reassortment with 39 complete and incomplete genome sets. The analysis of reassortment phenomena in swine influenza viruses was performed by several statistical techniques. The finding indicated that not only the surface glycoprotein coding proteins (HA and NA) but also the PB1 segment reassorted more frequently compared with other segments in swine viruses.de Silva et al. dataset presented 36 well supported candidate reassortants with strong confidence. The results indicated that the introduction of novel HA and/or NA genes into a previous circulating virus led to the reassortment events. Reassortment patterns of the identified strains offered new insight that drove us to draw a more well-rounded picture of the origin of some previously reported reassorted strains.Nagarajan et al. presented a more comprehensive reassortment study including human, avian and S-OIV influenza populations. A novel computational method GiRaF based on a fast biclique enumeration algorithm was applied to identify the sets of taxa with differential phylogenetic placement.",

Some of the reassortant strains identified by Silva et al. were reported for the first time. This could decrease the confidence of the candidates as true reassortant strains.

Selected avian, human and swine genomic strains are shown in Table 4, indicating the reassortment patterns based on host tropism and reassortment probabilities. The results incorporated the most likely host adaptation for each protein. Most of the reassortants displayed a diversity of host adaptation of influenza sequences in the genome.

Another finding was that the reassortment probability of strain A/domestic teal/Hunan/79/2005 was not high compared with others.

The H3N2 viruses recovered from Canada in January 1997 like A/swine/Ontario/00130/97 from Ontario isolates, which were regarded as wholly human influenza viruses [40]. It was consistent with our results that four segments M2, NA, PA and PB1 originated from human influenza viruses, suggesting strong interspecies transmission of the different clades. Similarly, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 lineage in Asia has demonstrated various combinations of its genes to form several generations of multiple reassortants [51].

These synthetic strains were regarded as the true label on the detection of reassortants. The synthetic dataset was divided into complete and incomplete genomes that contained 85 and 25 samples respectively. According to the rules of our model, the data of incomplete genomes contained two different sequences at least. We have summarized the results of reassortment detection on both complete and incomplete strains by HopPER in Table 5. HopPER correctly identified 19 out of 25 reassortants for incomplete genomes and 83 out of 85 reassortants for complete genomes on synthetic strains. The probabilities of reassortment can be seen in Additional file 1: Table S4. Though the incomplete information of genomes likely influenced the prediction of reassortment, the TPV achieved by HopPER on laboratory dataset (0.927) was more persuasive compared with the real dataset (0.855). On observation, the false positives reported by our model were dominated by incomplete samples. We have found that all these false positives only contain HA and NA proteins while most of the rest of incomplete genomes have more than two different segments (Additional file 1: Table S5). In general, we can infer that the number of available segments in a genome is a critical factor impacting the reliable estimation of reassortment probability. Despite this, the false positive rate was still less than 0.1 on synthetic datasets.\n",

It also poses great challenges for any other computational tools to identify reassortment events with lots of missing information in the genome. We are able to explore the reassortant strains in synthetic genomes by estimating the probabilities without constraining the integrity of genomes. Though the reassortment analysis on incomplete genomes brings uncertainty of probability estimation and increases the difficulty of identifying reassortment, the results are not greatly affected using HopPER. We have successfully identified 24 out of 35 and 19 out of 25 incomplete strains in real and synthetic datasets respectively. The TPVs of reassortment detection on incomplete strains has achieved noteworthy performance in comparison to complete ones. However, a look into the unsuccessful cases of incomplete strains finds most of the failures in genomes with only 2 segments. We also list the predicted reassortant strains by the number of available sequences in the genome (Additional file 1: Table S6). It demonstrates the effectiveness of HopPER in predicting reassortment of incomplete strains.",

            "text": "Since the emergence of 1918 Spanish pandemic, influenza A viruses have circulated and caused substantial morbidity and mortality in humans [52]. Despite the long-term existence of the influenza virus, the influence of the reassortment in the expected transmission properties of influenza viruses is still an area of active research. A study on 71 representative complete genomes sampled between 1918 to 2006 showed reassortment occurred frequently throughout the evolutionary history of the virus [53]. Though some reassortment events would not cause severe infections or lead to outbreaks, reassortment still plays an important role in the process of evolution and epidemiology for influenza viruses, particularly when considering transmission from avian or swine host populations into human populations. For example, pigs have been known as a mixing vessel with multiple reassortment events occurring. While most of the cases were mild to humans, three out of four pandemics are related to the reassorted swine strains. It is clear that the reassortment between influenza viruses from different host species can generate novel pandemic-potential strains. These antigenic and genetic novel strains are usually not well matched to the contemporaneous vaccines, and so existing vaccines offer little protection [10]. Detecting reassortment frequency among influenza viruses is also a crucial aspect to capture evolutionary history [54].",

            "text": "We applied HopPER to investigate the reassortment history on avian, human and swine species respectively. We utilize the RSR to illustrate the variety of reassortant strains. Figure 3 presents the RSR of influenza strains on three distinct species across different years. The experiments are conducted on the years with more than 20 genomes. The results reflect the complex reassortment histories and suggest the reliability compared with the actual evolutionary patterns. In Fig. 3a, the RSR sustains a relative low level until 2004, when the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype has re-emerged [55]. The HPAI H5N1 virus results from its ability to transmit through both human and bird hosts, leading to novel reassortant strains [56]. The human species describes the different situations in which RSR reaches the local peaks around the pandemic years. The RSR starts to decrease after the outbreak of 1976 pandemic when a new H1N1 strain predominated. After that, another pandemic occurred in 2009 caused by a triple reassortant swine-origin human strain during the time there is a rapid increase of RSR in Fig. 3b. The RSR of swine species varies differently from avian and human and it gains high value, except in 2008. We infer that the swine species, as the mixing vessel, more frequently participates in the reassortment process with both avian and human strains. According to Fig. 3, the RSR remains at relatively high level after 2009. This is because the progeny strains of these 2009 strains are still circulating around the world. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with post-infection ferret antisera indicates that the majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 [57]. It is noteworthy as a possible indication for the resurgence of another potential pandemic or epidemic after the current reassortant strains have been in circulation.\n",

We have demonstrated our model by different real and synthetic datasets and validated the results by comparison with alternative methods. HopPER can also be leveraged to detect any known complete or incomplete strains for reassortment identification and reassortant strains with robustness. So it is possible to build an automatic surveillance system to monitor the transmission and reassortment for influenza viruses.
