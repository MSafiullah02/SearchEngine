CD8+ T-cell levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory indicators ESR, CRP, and IL-6, while the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was positively correlated. Total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell levels were negatively associated with ESR, and NK cells were negatively correlated with IL-6. These findings indicate a more obvious change in CD8+ T cells than in other lymphocyte subsets after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, lymphocytes and their subsets, especially CD8+ T cells, might be a potential predictor for disease severity and clinical efficacy in COVID-19.",

However, these findings might be confounded by therapeutic factors. First, the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid could reduce the lymphocytes directly [17]. For the patients with corticosteroid treatment, the recovery of lymphocyte population might be weakened by the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid. Thus, we conducted a multivariate analysis to evaluate the effects of these potential confounders, and identified posttreatment decrease in CD8+ T cells and B cells and increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio as independent predictors for poor clinical efficacy, especially CD8+ T cells. Moreover, we also found that corticosteroid treatment increased total lymphocytes significantly in comparison to the patients without corticosteroid treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid might have contributed to the posttreatment increase in lymphocytes, which outweighed the lympholytic effects of corticosteroid.",
