Each infected person will typically infect fewer than one person before dying or recovering, so the outbreak itself will die out (i.e. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\frac{dI}{dt}\\big\\vert_{t=0^{+}}<0$\\end{document}). When R\n0>1, each person who becomes infected will infect on average more than one person, so the epidemic will spread (i.e. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\frac{dI}{dt}\\big\\vert_{t=0^{+}}>0$\\end{document}). While this definition is intuitive, conceptual problems immediately arise. For example, can one define a \u201ctypical\u201d infected individual? At what stage of the infection process is the infected individual introduced? What if there are distinct subpopulations or population structures? Is R\n0 then a meaningful concept? Considerable attention has been devoted to these questions (e.g. [31, 60, 66]), in particular due to the generalisation to more complex population and infection structures via the next generation matrix formalism [15]. However, these definitions are meaningful only if meaningful sub-populations can be defined, allowing for an exponential growth phase in an epidemic. Thus most network models with their complex structure do not lend themselves to such simple definitions, and the relationship between R\n0 and the network representation is further discussed below.",

In particular, if dC/dI>0, d\n\u03b2/dI>0, or d\n\u03b3/dI>0, global stability is lost. This can occur if, for example, removal of infected individuals requires the availability of limited resources, so that d\n\u03b3/dI>0 (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001, see [30]) or one may have dC/dI>0 if, for example, contacts are increased by otherwise sedentary individuals attempting to flee an epidemic, as may have occurred during the Black Death in the fourteenth century Europe. Each infected individual has a probability S/N per contact of interacting with a susceptible individual. For density dependent contact, C(N)=N and the form of system (4.1) is obtained. For \u201cfrequency dependent\u201d contact, C(N)=\u03ba, a constant. In this case, the rate that new infections appear is \u03c4\nSI\n\u03ba/N, and R\n0=\u03c4\n\u03ba/\u03b3. A critical difference between the two cases is that, with density dependence, thinning of the total population reduces N and therefore the value of R\n0, while with frequency dependence the reduction in population density or size has no effect on R\n0.",

Thus even for a disease with low probability of transmission and where the disease has been identified within a few generations of infection after its introduction, it would be difficult to identify and isolate subgroups of individuals who are at higher risk of becoming infected. Localisation is exemplified by spatial spread, such as found in lattice models, where nodes are positioned on a regular grid of locations, and neighbouring individuals are connected. Such lattice models/networks exhibit homogeneous contact but have much longer average path lengths and diameters than Poisson networks. Empirical measurements confirm that many real-world networks are characterised by greater localisation of connections\u2014i.e. the tendency for links to occur with greater probability than average amongst subgroups of nodes, but have small average path lengths very similar to that of Poisson random networks. Motivated by social structures where most individuals belong to localised communities composed of work colleagues, neighbours or people sharing similar interests, but some individuals also have connections with individuals that belong to other localised communities (e.g. relatives living considerable distances away and thus likely to belong to distant social communities as well) and old acquaintances, Watts and Strogatz [71] proposed the famous \u201csmall-world network\u201d (SWN) model, which uses a one-parameter model to interpolate between a regular lattice model and a Poisson network. Their model starts with a ring lattice with N nodes where each node is connected to an arbitrary fixed number K of its closest neighbours. Two types of SWNs have commonly been studied. In the original version, a random rewiring of all links is carried out with probability q. A variant with similar properties does not rewire, but adds long range links randomly, with probability q to generate the same number of long range links as in the original model (Fig. 4.1). \n",

As the latter approach simplifies some calculations but has the same key properties as the original model, it will be referred to later in the chapter. For a broad range of q, the SWN generates average path lengths approaching those observed in Poisson random graphs, yet with much greater localisation. The smaller average path length driven by the limited number of long-range connections (shortcuts) makes the network more connected, with fewer edges needed to connect any two nodes. A smaller average path length also means a smaller number of infectious generations with a shorter epidemic time scale, and a lower threshold for a large epidemic. The critical idea put forward by this model is that a relatively few \u201clong-distance\u201d connections are important for the transmission and persistence of disease. This has long been established, for example, within the metapopulation paradigm developed in the 1960s [50] where occasional migration between habitat patches was invoked to explain the persistence of species that would otherwise go extinct\u2014in the case of epidemiology, the metapopulation is the pathogen operating on the host (or communities of hosts), which represent the habitat patches, such as the cities and towns in the previously mentioned measles models [7, 28]. Where the model of Watts and Strogatz\u2019 differed, however, was showing in an elegantly simple model, and in a quantifiable way, how simple couplings defined only as a property of individuals could be weak, yet produce dramatic effects in communities.",

One measure of localisation is the clustering coefficient which can be quantified as \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$c=\\frac{3\\cdot \\mathit{triangles}}{\\mathit{triples}}$\\end{document}, where a triangle is defined by a set of three nodes X, Y and Z in a triplet, where X is connected to Y which is connected to Z, and X is also connected to Z. Clustering can be viewed as expressing the probability of two friends of any one individual being themselves friends of each other, and this is illustrated in the classic signature of the small world effect, which is the rapid decline in the average path length between nodes, when the clustering coefficient remains high [71]. This definition is not unique; for example, clustering can also be computed by averaging the clustering coefficients of individual nodes \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$c_{i}=\\frac{{E_{i}}}{{{k_{i}({k_{i}-1})}/2}}$\\end{document}, which represents the ratio between the number of links E\ni present amongst the neighbours of node and the possible maximum number of such links. For any meaningful definition, in networks approximating the structure of Poisson random networks have small inherent clustering, and in the limit of infinite populations, zero. Clustered networks can be generated by randomly distributing individuals/nodes in a given n-dimensional space (e.g. a specified two-dimensional surface) and assuming that the probability of a connection between two individuals is a function of their distance. By choosing an appropriate function, the average degree and clustering can be varied. Of course, clustering alone does not uniquely define a network; for example, an infinite number of networks can be generated with zero clustering.",

One approach to this is \u201cmoment closure\u201d [42, 44]. A population can be described in terms of the frequency of clusters of individuals of various types (e.g. S, I, and R) and of various sizes (singlets, doublets, triplets and so on; i.e. the \u2018moments\u2019 of the distribution). By including the frequency of moments of increasingly higher order, the population can be described with increasing accuracy, but at the cost of increasing complexity. Disease transmission is dependent on whether one of the pairs is connected to an infectious individual, i.e. if [SS] is the number of S+S pairs, and [SSI] the number of S+S+I triplets then \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$\\frac{{d[{SS}]}}{{dt}}\\propto [{SSI}]$\\end{document}.

In a similar fashion, the number of triplets requires knowledge about the number of quadruplets, and so on, and the system soon becomes completely intractable. Analytical tractability is achieved by \u201cclosing\u201d the system at the level of pairs and approximating triplets as a function of pairs and individual classes [44]. In clustered networks there will be some heterogeneity in the probability of association between two nodes (in social networks, for example, the probability that two people will be friends will increase if they have a friend in common, or for spatially clustered populations, that the Voronoi tessellation for three nodes produces a common boundary point [45]). To account for the correlation between the node in state X and node in state Z, a closure relation is considered [42], where if N is the total population size, and \u03a6 the expected proportion of triplets that are triangles, then \n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$[XYZ]\\approx \\frac{\\langle k\\rangle -1}{\\langle k\\rangle}\\frac{[XY][YZ]}{[Y]}\\biggl((1-\\varPhi)+\\frac{\\varPhi N}{\\langle k\\rangle}\\frac{[XZ]}{[X][Z]}\\biggr).$$\\end{document} This approach has the attractive feature that is transparent, easy to parameterise and builds on understanding global properties of the system based on local/neighbourhood interactions. The closure at the triplet level (i.e. ignoring loops incorporating four or more nodes) is a compromise between incorporating contact heterogeneity and retaining analytical tractability, and it has been successful in accounting for correlations that form due to diseases spreading amongst clusters of connected individuals. An important feature of even moderate levels of clustering is the rapid decrease in the average number of new infections produced by each infectious individual. Largely due to the depletion of the susceptible neighbourhood; past the first generation, infected nodes often have at least one neighbour that is already infected. In networks clustered in two dimensions, there is a corresponding spatial localisation of epidemics (Fig. 4.2). While moment closure can provide a good approximation to the time course of stochastic simulations on clustered networks [42], as always such good agreement depends on the underlying model being considered. Based on a model using Poisson-random networks with contact tracing and a delay before infectiousness [47], Fig. 4.2 shows how, even with no \u201cforced\u201d clustering (i.e. clustering only occurs due to population size effects), there is poor agreement between simulations and the analytic approximation, and this difference quickly becomes pronounced as clustering increases. While the sources of the discrepancy are not entirely clear, the delay in the onset of infectiousness and the addition of contact tracing add considerably to the complexity of the system being studied, highlighting the need for further research into analytical models of this type of contact heterogeneity. \n",

For STIs, the nature of the potentially infectious contact is well-defined, and it has long been understood that modelling their transmission and control must account for heterogeneities in sexual activity [2, 32]. Assume that the probability of transmission of an STI to an individual depends only on the number of potentially infectious contacts per individual and the probability of transmission per contact. Then the population can be divided into distinct groups, with each group defined solely by the number of contacts. The number of individuals with k contacts is N\nk (k=1,\u2026,n).

Although random graphs have been extensively used as models of real-world networks, particularly in epidemiology, they can have serious shortcomings when compared to empirical data characterising social structures such as networks of friendship within various communities, as well as structures in physical and biological systems, including food webs, neural networks and metabolic pathways. With surprising frequency, the empirically measured degree distribution has significantly higher variance-to-mean ratio compared to a Poisson distribution. Examples include the World Wide Web, the Internet, ecological food webs, protein\u2013protein interactions at the cellular level (e.g. [25]), and most relevant for this discussion, human sexual networks, all with degree distributions reasonably approximated as scale-free, i.e. p(k)\u2248k\n\u2212\u03b3 with 2<\u03b3\u22643, over several orders of magnitude (but see also [38]). As noted above, to account for the fact that each infected node past the first generation must have at least one link that ends in another infected node, the value of R\n0 differs slightly from (4.8): \n4.10\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$R_{0}=\\bar{p}\\langle k\\rangle \\biggl(\\frac{\\langle k^{2}\\rangle }{\\langle k\\rangle ^{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\langle k\\rangle }\\biggr).$$\\end{document} The translation in terms of the epidemiological parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 is slightly more difficult as the depletion of links from an infected node means that the transmission rate must be increased to maintain the same R\n0 [43] and this, in turn, changes the infection rate [26]. While the empirically determined distribution of sexual contacts is more precisely fit with a truncated scale-free distribution [38], in the limiting approximation of a scale-free infinite population with no truncation, R\n0\u2192\u221e since \u2329k\n2\u232a/\u2329k\u232a\u2192\u221e even though \u2329k\u232a is finite. It follows that even an arbitrarily small transmission rate \u03b2 can sustain an epidemic [58]. As implied by the name \u201cscale-free\u201d, random removal of nodes does not reduce the variance. Therefore, no amount of randomly applied, incomplete control (i.e. vaccination, quarantine) can prevent an epidemic. However, this is not the case for finite populations where the threshold behaviour is recovered [52], and targeting the small pool of highly connected nodes is sufficient to prevent an epidemic, so long as these individuals can be identified and treated or removed. Further, even in the absence of control, the supply of highly connected nodes is quickly depleted, resulting in rapid disease extinction.",

For \u03c1\n0<1, R\n0<1 on a random network, but for networks with higher variance-to-mean ratio, we can have R\n0>1.

Thus for sufficiently high \u03c1\n0, epidemics on random networks last longer, and also are able to reach more nodes. Above a value \u03c1\ncrit, the final epidemic size on random networks is larger [49, 52] and as \u03c1\n0\u2192\u221e, approaches its asymptote (the total population size) more rapidly than for scale-free networks (Fig. 4.5). \n",

The concurrency of links is well-studied [16, 18, 23, 55, 70] in the modelling of STIs, where the nature of the partnerships between individuals is emphasised, rather than the individuals themselves. This dyad-based approach often assumes that epidemic dynamics are driven by serially monogamous relationships [16, 55].

It has previously been suggested that if link dynamics evolve ergodically, then an appropriate static representation of the network will have the same characteristics as the original, dynamic network [41]. An example of an ergodic, dynamic network is one where the network evolution is a Markov chain, and all states are accessible from the initial state. This is considerably less restrictive than other explorations of network dynamics, where the number of links for each node is assumed fixed (e.g. [57, 68]). Here, the static network is generated by assigning to each node an infectious period drawn from an exponential distribution with mean period \u03c4\ninc. Then a number \u03bdrand of random links are generated and placed on the SWN with the restriction that the distance between the two connected nodes is greater than n/2.",

Because the removal and replacement of a link \u201cfrees\u201d up the link from already connecting two infected nodes, epidemic dynamics would be expected to be different on the static and dynamic networks (Fig. 4.6). Early on, it is more likely that a \u201cused\u201d up link will be replaced by a \u201cfree\u201d link, whereas the opposite would become true later in the epidemic, as more nodes are infected. Here, link dynamics are represented by a switching rate that defines an effective infectious period over a given link. Construction of a transmission network where every node has the same infectious period distribution is equivalent to a bond percolation model [65]. The static representation allows us to quantify these differences, by considering the effective infectious period of a node, with respect to a dynamic random link. Assuming SIR infection dynamics with exponentially distributed periods, the average infectious period is \u03c4\ninc=1/r\ninc and for transmission over the random links, the average effective infectious period must be modified by the switching rate, and therefore \u03c4\neff=1/(r\ninc+r\nswitch).

This is often the only logical approach if, for instance, no disease data are available, or if the properties of the underlying social network are being exploited for disease control. For example, for the purposes of analysing the efficacy of tracing of potentially infectious contacts for disease control, understanding the social network is vital [17, 34, 47]. However, in the absence of control, or when control is not based on exploiting social network structure, given a contact network and the characteristics of a disease that can spread on the network, one can thin links to generate the network of truly infectious links (as disease will not necessarily spread across all available links), referred to as the \u201ctransmission\u201d network. Such a network is inherently directed (since one must consider separately the probability of infection in each direction) even when the social network is undirected; however, the thinned network is usually significantly more sparse. Further, while the social network may have weights attached to links and nodes, the transmission network is unweighted so long as the infectious state of any node is not dependent on any network parameters (e.g. one cannot have a node that is more infectious if it has been infected by exposure to multiple infected neighbours).",

Within-region modelling is defined by a compartmental model with homogenised mixing and density dependent contact, implemented with discrete probabilities of transition between states, and discrete time steps. An underlying assumption is that the pattern of air travel reflects the mean characteristics of the population\u2014whether or not some individuals are more likely to travel than others, and whether or not that is correlated with within-region behaviour, susceptibility or transmissibility, is not considered. Compartments are also treated generically, with the same structure and parameters for all regions despite the likelihood of epidemiologically important differences in the way people behave around the world. Thus the within-centre model remains highly abstract, and there is no consideration of the balance in detail accorded the disease model and the network model complexity. Is the detail of the transport network necessary for understanding the level of stochasticity and outputs generated? These simplifications imply that direct interpretation of model parameters must be treated with caution; scientifically this relatively parsimonious approach is appropriate if the intention is to concentrate on the relationship between air transport contact heterogeneity and disease transmission. The availability of epidemiological data is critical for getting this balance right. Optimisation is relatively unsophisticated, using a least squares approach to optimise the Hong Kong data (in the paper, they do not seek to optimise the Hellinger measure of (4.18)). Despite these issues, the integration of more explicit disease dynamics at a lower population scale, with the explicit demographic interaction is a welcome consideration, and the approaches used in this analysis have the potential to be broadly applicable across other disease systems, and would provide useful insights. Here, the critical result of the model is that it is a good predictor of regions that did have meaningful numbers of cases, with the majority of these being directly related to the activity originating from Hong Kong. The most telling indicator of the role of network heterogeneity and the interaction between the network model and within-node dynamics is the risk to Spain, which is mainly due to secondary connections from other European countries (UK, France, and Germany) rather than direct links from Hong Kong.",

Such data, recorded on a day-to-day basis, is an exceptional record of a dynamic disease-relevant network for which there exists disease data on which to test our concepts of social networks in epidemiology. These livestock networks have been extensively analysed, and have been shown to exhibit both small world and scale-free properties [41, 48]. Particularly well described is the movement of cattle, as individual animal movements are recorded, largely due to concerns over the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the 1990s. Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) is a zoonotic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the tuberculosis clonal complex and an important cause of tuberculosis in humans, though less importantly in developed countries due to milk pasteurisation. It has been an endemic disease in British cattle for centuries which, however, was largely eliminated from most herds with the introduction of a widespread test-and-slaughter programme in the first half of the twentieth century. However, BTB incidence in cattle has been steadily on the rise for the last four decades, with the estimated cost of control reaching \u00a390 million in 2005 and including \u00a335 million in compensation to farmers. Disease spread at the national level is likely due to both cattle movements [24] and other factors, most controversially transmission from infected badgers in high-risk areas. As BTB in cattle is a notifiable disease, all cattle testing positive for BTB are recorded centrally, with regular tests of all herds occurring every one, two, three or four years, depending on the perceived risk of transmission to cattle. This combination of long term disease plus demographic data allows for an exceptional opportunity to identify the role of detailed network structure in the transmission of disease.",

Maximum likelihood estimates were initially determined using the Nelder\u2013Mead algorithm [56], and the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm [29] was then used to explore parameter space around the best-fit parameters through a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC). The model showed that the outbreak data are best explained by a model attributing roughly 16% of observed breakdowns to recorded cattle movements, and with only low levels of cattle-to-cattle transmission. High risk areas by circles surrounding BTB breakdowns were found to be better predictors of future risk of BTB breakdowns than officially designated high risk parishes, with predictions based on these unidentified high-risk herds being also responsible for an estimated 47 breakdowns through movements of infected cattle. The results also suggest that eliminating transmission associated with high-risk areas would reduce the number of BTB breakdowns by 75% in the first year alone. Of particular relevance here is the identification of cattle life histories as a better indicator of the role of network spread, than simply the connections between premises, emphasising the importance of accurate definition of the appropriate network structure. Here, because BTB appears to be of relatively low infectiousness via cattle-to-cattle transmission, transient residence of cattle on premises is insufficient to seed infection in many cases, and thus outward links from premises only exposed to BTB via cattle movements are unlikely to be a risk themselves. This result is similar to a more detailed comparison between static and dynamic representations of the cattle network [67].",

Hughes et al. [36] studied extensive viral sequences from 11,071 heterosexual patients infected with HIV. Of these, 2774 were closely linked to at least one other sequence by nucleotide distance. Including the closest sequences, 296 individuals were identified to be in groups of three or more individuals in the UK. The analysis revealed that heterosexual HIV transmission in the UK is clustered, but compared to transmission amongst MSM (men who have sex with men) groups, are on average in smaller groups and with slower transmission dynamics. Despite the reduced clustering compared to MSM, highly heterogeneous contact rates were indicated, consistent with heavy-tailed distributions indicated in previous studies [37, 51]. Using molecular clock estimates, temporal patterns could also be analysed, rather than just social ones, which is crucial when relationship concurrency (i.e. network dynamics) is important [70]. The analysis of these data revealed extremely long intergenerational periods (27 months), almost twice as long as for MSM. This long generational time makes contact tracing (and thus direct identification of the social contact network) difficult. However, the relationship between the identified clusters and the known heavy-tailed distributions from epidemiological studies (Fig. 4.10) would suggest that, while a snapshot of the direct contact network would not identify truly at risk individuals, the overall pattern is consistent with the dynamic, evolving network over which HIV is transmitted. \n",

Random sampling is unlikely to identify directly critical links if these are few in number. However, if the sample is random at the population level, differences in the relatedness between individuals measured directly by epidemiological contact tracing, and via genetic relatedness should show the existence of these missing links. However, this does not allow for direct inference into the nature of such missing links. Indeed, such approaches on their own, cannot distinguish between sequential events that occur at different scales. For example, if a sequence AAA is taken from individual X, a sequence ABA from individual Y and ABC from individual Z, this implies that X and Y are more closely related by the Hamming distance measure, but it is not known, for example, if all the mutations occurred in X and therefore whether or not Z is a descendant of Y, or they are \u201csiblings\u201d. For better estimates of this, more detailed demographic data is required, which are not usually available for human sexual contacts.",

Endemic in large parts of Africa, South America and Asia, both Western Europe and North America are FMD free, and derive considerable economic benefit from this status. FMD was introduced into GB in 2001, and the resulting epidemic cost well over \u00a35 billion to control, with the loss of over 3 million livestock [30]. In 2007, FMD was again introduced into GB, this time via an escaped strain derived from virus held either the World Reference Laboratory in Pirbright, or the adjacent Meriel vaccine production facility; while considerably less extensive, nevertheless, the epidemic caused widespread disruption of the livestock industry at the national level, and cost almost \u00a3100 million to control [11]. Both the 2001 and 2007 foot-and-mouth disease epidemics are exceptionally well described, with detailed demographic and epidemiological information, including virus samples from across the entire epidemic. It is therefore an exceptional model system for understanding and developing phylodynamic principles [33]. FMD virus is an RNA virus with an exceptionally high mutation rate, sufficient so that discrimination of mutations down to the individual-to-individual level is possible. Preliminary studies into the phylodynamics of the 2001 epidemic have used a combined likelihood function that incorporates both Hamming distance measures and the spatio-temporal dynamics models used in previous studies. In this case, the likelihood function is fixed by epidemiological parameters. The most likely date of infection for each farm was estimated to be the date on which disease was reported on the farm, minus the age of the oldest lesion on the farm as estimated by veterinary investigation, less five days for the maximum within-host incubation period. There is uncertainty around the most likely date of infection, due to errors in the lesion dating, and possible variation in the incubation period by I\ni(t) , and the possibility of missed, infected livestock. Given the estimated most likely date of infection of farm i, the most likely infection date of the first on-farm infection, and the examination date of the farm, allowing for a two day incubation period, determined the very latest possible infection time. The probability that a farm i was infectious at time F\ni(t) is then given in terms of I\ni(t) and the incubation period distribution L(k) (where k is the incubation period in days) as \n4.21\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$F_{i}(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l@{\\quad}l}\\sum_{\\tau =0}^{t}\\bigl(I_{i}(\\tau )\\cdot \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^{t-\\tau }L(k)\\bigr)\\bigr),&\\text{if }t\\leq C_{i},\\\\[4pt]0,&\\text{if }t>C_{i}.\\end{array}\\right.$$\\end{document} If one then considers the probability \u03bb\nij that each infected premises i infects susceptible premises j then \n4.22\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\lambda _{ij}=\\frac{\\sum_{t=0}^{\\min (C_{i},C_{j})}(I_{i}(\\tau )\\cdot F_{j}(t))}{\\sum_{k\\neq i}\\bigl(\\sum_{t=0}^{\\min (C_{j},C_{k})}(I_{i}(\\tau )\\cdot F_{k}(t))\\bigr)},$$\\end{document} where n is the number of infected premises in the population.

While the history of mathematical epidemiology contains many of the ideas that have since been replicated in social network theory, nevertheless, the study of social networks has generated both new ideas and new impetus to understanding the role that contact heterogeneity can play in the spread, persistence and control of infectious diseases. This interplay offers new ideas that are applicable to many other fields where heterogeneous structure is important. Apologies are offered to the authors of many valuable and interesting papers originating from both traditions that have been omitted. Of particular note amongst the omissions are the numerous recent epidemiological analyses that consider complex population structure and its impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic starting in 2009 (e.g. [3, 10, 22]). While many of these analyses are of epidemiological interest, the models are fundamentally similar to those discussed here in the context of SARS. In general, rather than presenting an exhaustive study of the results from either, illustrations have been presented of how it is only by considering a combination of both pattern and process can disease dynamics be properly understood. Critical to this is the interplay of individuals from both traditions, who will bring together the analytical strengths and insights they both have to offer (e.g. [5]). Of growing interest is the increasing use of molecular epidemiology as a tracing tool, which brings both new opportunities and new challenges, as a coherent, rigorous framework for dealing with phylogenetics, disease dynamics, high dimensional statistical inference and network structure is yet to be established. This will undoubtedly be a major subject of interest over the next decade, and this is the central problem in the growing field of phylodynamics [33].",
