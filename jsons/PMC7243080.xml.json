            "text": "Despite the high prevalence of parental substance misuse that is below the diagnostic criteria for dependence, little is understood about the impact of such patterns of parental substance misuse upon children. As the number of children living with a substance-misusing parent is higher than those living with a substance-dependent parent, the greatest burden of harm on a population level is likely to be experienced by these children. The furthering of knowledge in this area is fundamental to enable effective and early responses to address the needs of the families affected. This rapid evidence assessment reviews published evidence reporting on adverse health, psychological, substance use, educational, and social outcomes of children of nondependent substance-misusing parents. We limit our review to high-risk patterns of parental substance misuse.",

The methodological quality of each study included was assessed according to the criteria presented in the quality assessment tool for systematic reviews of observational studies (Wong, Cheung, & Hart, 2008). This scale is based on a cumulative score across 5 items: external validity, reporting (2 items), bias, and confounding factors. Studies achieving 67% or more in scoring were regarded as high quality, 34\u201366% medium, and less than 34% low quality. We have standardized the language used within the review when referring to all studies meeting the criteria for high-risk parental substance misuse. We use the term parental substance misuse when referring to studies that report on parents who misuse alcohol and/or drugs. When the source study examines only alcohol or drug misuse, we use the term parental alcohol misuse or parental drug misuse, respectively. Within the tables and figures, however, we will include further clarification relating to the specific levels reported upon within the source studies.",

(2015) and Tyrrell, Orton, Tata, and Kendrick (2012) conducted high-quality large UK population-based matched nested case-control studies investigating the association between maternal alcohol misuse and other risk factors for accidental child injury aged 0\u20135 years. Children whose mother\u2019s medical record showed a history of alcohol misuse were found to have a 2-fold higher odds of long bone fracture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.33, 95% CI [1.13, 4.82], p < .05; Baker, Orton, Tata, & Kendrick, 2015) and a 5-fold higher odds of medicinal poisoning (OR = 5.44, 95% CI [1.99, 14.91], p < .01; Tyrrell, Orton, Tata, & Kendrick, 2012) compared to those without a record of maternal alcohol misuse. A large, high-quality, retrospective population study based on Finnish health-care registers found that children of substance-misusing mothers were hospitalized due to injury or illness significantly more frequently and for longer than children whose mothers did not misuse substances. Inpatient care episodes per 1,000 children were almost double in the group of children with substance misusing mothers to that of the comparison group (2,117 vs. and 1,184) with a mean duration of 3.3 days and 2.4 days, respectively (Raitasalo, Holmila, Autti-Ramo, Notkola, & Tapanainen, 2015). This association was most pronounced in mothers who misused both alcohol and drugs. Remaining studies were of low quality; therefore, caution should be applied when considering results. These studies reported that poor diet (Jeffreys, Hirte, Rogers, & Wilson, 2009), low weight (below the 10th percentile; Joya et al., 2009), and increased rates of dental problems (Cornelius et al., 2004, Jeffreys et al., 2009) in children were associated with substance misuse by parents, while studies have found no correlation between parental alcohol misuse and sleep in children (Tarokh & Carskadon, 2010; Tarokh et al., 2012).",

Parental alcohol misuse has been found to be associated with conduct problems (Kendler et al., 2013; Malone et al., 2002, Malone et al., 2010), most defiant disorders (Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2010), delinquency (Kendler et al., 2013), and violence (Rossow, Pape, & Wichstrom, 1999). There were mixed findings relating to attention and hyperactivity difficulties in the children of alcohol misusers, with two studies finding a significant association (Kendler et al., 2013; Torvik et al., 2011), while two papers from one linked study found no association (Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2010). Only one study examined the impact of parental misuse of substances other than alcohol (Torvik et al., 2011), finding an association of modest effect size upon child attention and conduct problems. Studies mostly reported association between both mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 substance misuse and child externalizing difficulties. One paper reported that the relationship was greater when maternal alcohol misuse was present (Torvik et al., 2011). A further study found gender-modeling associations between the parent and child; maternal alcohol misuse was found to be significantly correlated with rule-breaking and aggressive behavior in girls but not in boys, while paternal alcohol misuse was found to be significantly associated with aggressive behavior in boys but not girls (Finan, Schulz, Gordon, & Ohannessian, 2015).",

In a medium quality study using child report measures of parental drinking, both paternal and maternal alcohol misuse were related to depression and anxiety for girls but not for boys (Ohannessian, 2012). In a small, medium-quality cohort study of Korean school children aged 12\u201316 years, parental alcohol misuse was found to be positively and significantly associated with internalizing disorders (Lee & Cranford, 2008). Associations in a high-quality study however did not reach significance (Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2010).",

This evidence is mostly of medium to high quality with only two studies being of low quality (Jeffreys et al., 2009; Yule, Wilens, Martelon, MSimon, & Biederman, 2013). Parental alcohol and/or drug misuse was significantly associated with early onset adolescent drinking (Kerr, Capaldi, Pears, & Owen, 2012; Vermeulen-Smit et al., 2012), alcohol consumption (Cranford, Zucker, Jester, Puttler, & Fitzgerald, 2010; Haugland, Holmen, Ravndal, & Bratberg, 2013; Jennison, 2014; Keeley, Mongwa, & Corcoran, 2015; Shorey et al., 2013; Vermeulen-Smit et al., 2012), alcohol intoxication (Haugland, Holmen, Krokstad, Sund, & Bratberg, 2015; Haugland et al., 2013; Haugland, Strandheim, & Bratberg, 2012; Keeley et al., 2015; Rossow et al., 1999), and the development of alcohol problems (Kendler et al., 2013; Lieb et al., 2002) as well as adolescent illicit drug use (Delaney-Black et al., 2011; Haugland et al., 2012; Hofler et al., 1999; Hopfer, Stallings, Hewitt, & Crowley, 2003; Jeffreys et al., 2009; Keeley et al., 2015; Malone et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2010; Shorey et al., 2013). Having two parents who misuse substances was highlighted as being particularly predictive of adolescent substance use (Keeley et al., 2015; Swaim, Beauvais, Walker, & Silk-Walker, 2011), with regular alcohol use being almost 4 times as likely (OR = 3.83, CI [1.65, 8.89], p < .01) and past year illicit drug use almost 6 times as likely (OR = 5.90, CI [2.54, 13.7], p < .001) as adolescents with two nonsubstance misusing parents (Keeley et al., 2015).",

Studies found that only fathers\u2019 and not mothers\u2019 substance misuse was positively associated with adolescent drinking (Cranford et al., 2010; Ohannessian, 2012) and the range of substances used in adolescent children (Shorey et al., 2013). Further studies, however, reported only maternal alcohol misuse (Kerr et al., 2012) and maternal drug misuse (Yule et al., 2013) to be significantly associated with development of alcohol or drug misuse in children. When also considering child gender, both boys and girls have been found to be significantly more likely to engage with substance using behaviors if their parents misused alcohol, with boys in particular being found to experience a negative effect (Haugland et al., 2012).",

Using a large cohort of over 740,000 Swedish individuals, Berg, Back, Vinnerljung, and Hjern (2016) conducted a high-quality study finding that alcohol-related hospital admissions in parents were significantly associated with lower school performance in adolescents aged 15\u201316 years (Berg, Back, Vinnerljung, & Hjern, 2016). School behavioral problems were associated with paternal alcohol misuse in early childhood, with a 3-fold risk of truancy, absenteeism, suspensions, and conduct problems in a medium quality study (Jennison, 2014). Family dysfunction, conflict, and ineffectual parenting were found to be strongly correlated to adverse school outcomes for children in families with an alcohol misusing father. The low levels of attachment and bonding to biological fathers found to be associated with an increase in school-related behavioral problems of the children were notable. A small low-quality study in Australia also found children of substance misusers were more often absent or late for school (Jeffreys et al., 2009).",

Four studies of medium quality considered the association between alcohol misusing parents and the parent\u2013child relationship. While one study showed no significant impact upon the support provided to the child from the parent (van der Zwaluw et al., 2008), a further study reported that children of alcohol misusing parents were significantly less likely to feel emotionally close to their father, either due to the impact of alcohol misuse upon the father\u2019s behavior, conflict within the home, abdication of family responsibilities, or estrangement (Jennison, 2014). Parental bonding and the parent\u2013child relationship were negatively related to both mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 alcohol misuse in other research (Shorey et al., 2013). There is conflicting evidence that parental monitoring is negatively associated with parental alcohol misuse. One study reported a significant association between parental alcohol misuse and lower levels of parental monitoring (Shorey et al., 2013), while a further study reported that parental alcohol misuse was unrelated to a number of measures of neglectful parenting practices (Freisthler, Johnson-Motoyama, & Kepple, 2014).",

Children of alcohol misusing mothers were 5 times more likely to be placed in care by their seventh birthday than those raised by nonalcohol misusing parents. Those born to drug misusing mothers were over 7 times more likely to be in care by the age of 7, while children whose mothers misused both alcohol and drugs faced a 9-fold increased risk. These relationships persisted after controlling for the child\u2019s gender and mothers\u2019 socioeconomic status. Once in care, children of substance misusing mothers were discharged 183% faster than those children whose mothers did not misuse substances (Hussey & Guo, 2005). This somewhat counterintuitive finding is most likely to relate to an accelerated decision to place the children in permanent care however rather than reunification of the family. Further, the low quality of this study means that findings should be interpreted with caution. A cohort study of children taken into care also reported on the range of abuse children may experience while living within substance misusing homes (Jeffreys et al., 2009). Due to the small sample size in this study, no statistical testing could be conducted. As such, the existence of a correlation between parental substance use and abuse is unknown.",

The methodological quality of studies examining an association with diet, child weight, and dental health is however of low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Maternal alcohol misuse in particular is highlighted as a key predictor for poorer child health. This may in part relate to the greater role mothers tend to play in the child\u2019s early years.

Social learning theory explains that we learn behavior from observing, imitating, and modeling those around us (Bandura, 1997). It is possible that when children observe their parents consuming alcohol and/or drugs, it encourages the development of normative views about substance use.

The evidence for an association with other social and relational difficulties is however mixed. There was some suggestion that parental alcohol use was associated with lower levels of parent\u2013child bonding, communication, and overall relationship quality. However, evidence of neglectful parenting or inadequate parental supervision was limited and at times contradictory and as such caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding an association between parental substance misuse and the quality of parental supervision.

Typically, they rely upon observations of the parent\u2019s physical presentation and behavior, which is unlikely to detect levels of misuse below the diagnostic criteria for dependence (Galvani et al., 2013). Furthermore, those parents who are identified as being substance misusers often do not receive an intervention, with parents expressing reluctance to engage with specialist drug and alcohol treatment providers as they did not perceive themselves as having a substance misuse problem (Forrester & Harwin, 2006). This suggests that early, opportunistic intervention delivered by a nontreatment specialist may be more appropriate.",

However, there are no studies examining the effectiveness of screening and brief interventions with substance misusing parents including those whose children are involved with child welfare services. This represents a missed opportunity to intervene with this population before a parent has developed substance dependency. Such intervention has the potential to prevent the development of more problematic patterns of use and prevent harm to children. Social workers should engage in conversations with parents, which promote the parent\u2019s ability to link their substance misuse with adverse experiences and risk of negative outcomes for their child. Such an interaction may replicate the \u201cteachable moment\u201d found to be conducive of behavior change following the delivery of brief interventions within other settings (Babor & Grant, 1992) and improving outcomes for children.",

There are however some notable gaps. In early childhood (0\u20137 years), the literature focuses upon the relationship between mothers\u2019 substance misuse and child physical health, with a paucity of research examining behavioral problems, parent\u2013child bonding, or preparation for school as well as the impact of fathers\u2019 substance misuse. In early adolescence (10\u201313 years), there is a lack of research into child education outcomes, and in each stage of adolescence (10\u201318 years), there is a lack of research into parental substance misuse and child health. There is limited research that considers parental illicit drug misuse throughout the child\u2019s development, with the majority of research examining the difficulties in children of alcohol misusing parents.",

Such naive comparisons of exposed and unexposed groups cannot adequately account for the many potential confounders nor precisely account for the measurement of effect (Fewell, Davey Smith, & Sterne, 2007). For example, genetic predisposition (Agrawal & Lynskey, 2008) and the interaction between genes and the environment (Cleveland & Wiebe, 2003) may result in intergeneration transmission of substance misuse. Alcohol permissive parenting (Ennett et al., 2016; Hung, Chang, Luh, Wu, & Yen, 2015), adolescent monitoring (Kerr, Stattin, & Burk, 2010), lower parent\u2013child relationship quality (Donaldson, Handren, & Crano, 2016; El-Sheikh & Buckhalt, 2003; Shorey et al., 2013), and greater family conflict (El-Sheikh & Flanagan, 2001; Kelly et al., 2011) have been associated with increased child substance misuse. Furthermore, the direction of a reported relationship cannot be determined. For example, while children\u2019s conduct difficulties could be a result of parental alcohol misuse, a parent whose child has conduct difficulties may struggle to cope with their child\u2019s behavior and their alcohol consumption may increase in response. While longitudinal studies can highlight the temporal associations between variables and may offer greater insight into causation, such inferences are reliant upon the timing of the behavior in relation to the outcome. For example, studies examining the impact of parental substance misuse upon internalizing difficulties in children may assess children prior to the emergence of any symptoms or early childhood exposure to parental substance misuse may be undetected due to behavior change that predates study inclusion (Katikireddi, Green, Taylor, Smith, & Munafo, 2017).",

Specifically, research examining the various impacts of both alcohol and illicit drug misuse throughout the stages of the child\u2019s development. Future research should include both fathers and mothers and be sufficiently powered to enable analysis of the impact of mothers\u2019 versus fathers\u2019 use upon male and female children and utilize longitudinal design, with regular follow-up throughout the child\u2019s development. This would offer opportunity for causal inferences and also enable age-related and temporal associations to emerge. There is also a need for more high-quality research examining the health, educational, and social impact of parental substance misuse. The significant variation in how substance misuse patterns are described within research has presented a great challenge to this review and ultimately in the further of knowledge in this area.

There is also a need to consider the protective factors that may be present, which may enhance child resilience to harm. This review has highlighted evidence that an association between parental substance misuse is greater when both parents are substance misusers. Put another way, the presence of one nonsubstance misusing parent offers some protection. Using the language of protection, rather than risk, affords an opportunity to view such protective factors as a possible intervention mechanism to enhance resilience. Given the evidence identified that factors such as maternal closeness, attachment, and parent\u2013child relationship quality are moderators of adversity (Shorey et al., 2013), future research should include a range of mediators and, importantly, moderators of harm, which may inform intervention development.",

Rather, children may be affected by a wider continuum of harmful parental substance misuse; children who are likely to be less visible to practitioners. While practitioners may find it challenging to identify parents whose use is not within the dependent range (Galvani et al., 2013), intervening early in parental risk factors including alcohol and drug misuse to safeguard children has been highlighted in guidance for health, social care, and third sector partners (Department of Health, 2013; HM Government, 2015; Munro, 2011). As the number of children living with a nondependent substance misusing parent is likely to be greater than those living with a substance-dependent parent, intervening with nondependent parents is likely to bring about most benefit to children on a population level. Working to promote resilience and to enhance the child\u2019s protective factors is also important. Parents who do not misuse substances are a resource to this end. Moreover, intervening before a parent has developed a dependency has the potential to prevent the development of more problematic patterns of use and prevent harm to children.",
