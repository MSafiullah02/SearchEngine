Many conditions, such as trauma, infection and sepsis could lead to ALI [2]. Despite the diversity in etiology, inflammation takes an indispensable part in the process of ALI. Although many medical therapies are used to treat ALI/ARDS, there is still an in-hospital mortality rate over 30% [1]. Thus, development of novel therapeutic strategies especially targeting the overwhelming inflammation in ALI remains urgent.",

Briefly, upon activation, NLRP3 interacts with ASC which bridges NRLP3 to procaspase 1 and allows for activation of caspase 1. Once activated, caspase 1 can cleave the proforms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 into their mature and active forms [5]. In the lungs, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 production are augmented with LPS challenge in the ALI mice [6].",

The critical link between P2X7, IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 has been brought to light recently. P2X7 has been reported as a trigger for NLRP3 activation [22]. Activation of NLRP3 results in assembly of the NLRP3/ASC/caspase 1 complex which facilitates caspase 1-mediated processing and release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 [23]. Previous studies have shown that NLRP3 and caspase 1 regulate the inflammatory process in many lung diseases such as ALI [24], [25], Chlamydia pneumoniae infection [26], acute allergic airway inflammation [27], rituximab-induced interstitial lung disease (R-ILD) [28] and late lung fibrosis [29]. In our study, NLRP3 was activated in the lungs of ALI mice accompanied with enhanced expression of P2X7. Blockade of P2X7 resulted in inhibition of NLRP3/ASC/caspase 1 activation, suppression of IL-1\u03b2 production and attenuation of lung injury, all of which indicates that the P2X7/NLRP3 pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of ALI.",

IL-17 acts as a potent mediator in autoimmunity and neutrophil inflammation by increasing chemokine production in various tissues to recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL-17A could regulate CXC chemokine and G-CSF production which is necessary for neutrophil differentiation, activation and recruitment [31], [32]. IL-17 producing \u03b3\u03b4 T and Th17 lymphocytes are reported to mediate lung inflammation in experimental silicosis while IL-17R-deficient animals or IL-17A antibody neutralization reduced neutrophil influx and lung injury [33]. IL-17 is also found to mediate ALI induced by influenza A (H1N1) virus [34]. In our study, IL-17A was markedly elevated in the lung tissues and BAL fluids of ALI mice as demonstrated by ELISA analysis. Blockade of P2X7 with A438079 significantly reduced IL-17 production as well as neutrophil accumulation in conjunction with inhibition of NLRP3 pathway. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 is a key contributor to human pulmonary injury and to the viral-storm during SARS coronavirus infection and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [35], [36], [37]. Our data showed that blockade of P2X7 also suppressed the production of IFN-\u03b3.",

Such an increase in inflammasome components might be simply due to the increased population of innate immune cells in the lung tissues during ALI. Therefore, the suppressed expression of NLRP3 inflammmasome components by P2X7 treatment might reflect the reduced infiltration of innate immune cells. However, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was also significantly inhibited by P2X7 treatment, as evidenced by reduced cleavage of caspase 1, suggesting that therapeutic effects of P2X7 blockage is mediated through inhibition of NLRP3 activation rather than non-specific reduction of inflammatory infiltration. This was confirmed by our in vitro study using BMDMs, which showed over 50% decline in caspase 1 activation with the treatment of P2X7 antagonist.",

            "text": "Activation of the NLRP3 pathway is proposed to require two signals. Signal 1 for priming is a cytokine or Toll-like receptor ligand such as LPS, which trigger the synthesis of NLRP3. Signal 2 is the activation signal such as ATP, nigericin or monosodium urate, which acts through the P2X7 receptor [38], [39]. In our study, BMDMs were primed with LPS in the presence or absence of A438079 for 4 h followed by stimulation with ATP for 1 h. It is surprising to note that A438079 not only inhibited NLRP3 activation but also decreased the expression of NLRP3 and ASC. This finding suggests that A438079 also has other unspecified effects during the priming. Indeed, a recent study has shown that treatment with A438079 inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation [40]. Since NF-\u03baB is required for the synthesis of NLRP3 induced by LPS [38], inhibition of ERK (upstream of NF-\u03baB [41]) may reduce the expression of NLRP3.",
