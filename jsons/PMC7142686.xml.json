Current data suggests that 15% paediatric COVID positive cases are asymptomatic and 25% present with features of an upper respiratory tract infection [1]. There are also concerns regarding the high viral load of asymptomatic paediatric patients [2]. A disproportionately high number of health care workers (otolaryngologists in particular) have been infected during the course of their recent clinical work [[3], [4], [5]]. The current risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 to clinicians is difficult to gage based on clinical patient assessment.",

Asymptomatic patients are at risk of viral shedding during examination and procedural work involving these areas should also recognise the risk of transmission across adjacent surfaces [6]. Our current recommendation is all paediatric patients undergoing urgent otolaryngology procedures should be treated as suspected COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise due to the higher proportion of asymptomatic children carrying COVID-19. This is in keeping with guidance emerging from surgical societies and professional organisations [7]. While universal screening of patients prior to surgery would be ideal, few institutions around the world are currently equipped to do so due to restricted availability of testing resources. False negative test results remain an area of concern. As such, specific recommendations about which patients to test is currently evolving day by day and is beyond the scope of our discussion.",

As mentioned, a PPE-protected clean member of nursing staff allocated to this equipment stockpile streamlined the time taken for the case. All equipment including light-leads, cameras, suction should all be set up and checked prior to arrival of patient in the room.",

Where the temptation is to remove PPE quickly at the end of the case, additional time should be allocated for this. As team members doff, team members need to supervise each other as they doff (especially while staff are new to PPE) to prompt the steps of doffing with proper hand hygiene to be performed between steps. Laminated guides on the wall in these areas are also helpful. This is especially important given the high level of contamination of the theatre and onto staff's PPE during MLB. Aerosol settling time of 20 min is allocated at our institution between the patient leaving at the end of the case prior to any cleaning by nursing staff.",
