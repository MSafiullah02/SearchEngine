Peasah et al. reported that 12 out of 18 studies focusing on the economic benefits of influenza vaccination of children found it to be cost-saving [16]. A recent systematic literature review included 10 studies focused on vaccination of school-aged children; they found vaccination of all children versus only high-risk children to be dominant to $47,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY, societal) and to $18,000 per QALY (health care system) [17]. Unfortunately, most of these studies were focused on high-income countries, particularly the United States and selected European countries.

A non-excluding explanation may be a cohort effect favoured by either the exposure of this age group to the pandemic A H1N1 virus during the 2009\u20132010 season, the post-pandemic vaccination coverage, or multiple yearly influenza vaccinations in the last decade, which, as some studies suggest, may have provided effective protection [36\u201339].

While Peasah et al. reviewed the cost and cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination, very few of the studies reported national estimates, and of those, all but one (Thailand) were from high-income countries [16]. Jamotte et al. estimated the public health impact and economic benefit of introducing a quadrivalent vaccine as opposed to a trivalent vaccine, which was standard practice at the time of the study in Brazil, Colombia, and Panama [48]. However, their analysis did not include the school-aged population as it was not policy to vaccinate that age group at the time the study was conducted. The data reported in the present study demonstrated that the expansion of the current national immunisation programme to the school-aged population would greatly benefit the Mexican public health system, and is of value to health care policy makers in middle-income countries. Our analysis revealed that even when using a conservative scenario (30% vaccine coverage, 19% vaccine effectiveness), this intervention was still cost-effective. We believe there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, the cost of the influenza vaccine is significantly less expensive than the cost of treatment; the cost to vaccinate a child is approximately 3 USD, while the cost of treatment (including indirect costs) could be as high as 50,000 USD. Secondly, vaccinating children provides a significant herd effect. As previously mentioned, children are considered superspreaders; thus, vaccination of the school-aged population provides clinical benefits to other age groups by reducing influenza transmission. As noted in the sensitivity analysis (Fig. 4), although the cost of intervention was greater than the economic benefit in the conservative scenario, when the effect on the number of cases from other age groups was considered, the cost was offset, providing an overall economic benefit.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. The databases used in this study did not completely overlap in duration which may have affected our results. Additionally, data regarding the number of school-aged children included in our study who received the influenza vaccination before the age of 5 years were not available. It has been reported that vaccination of children < 5 years of age provides benefit [50], so our inability to factor this variable into our analysis may have affected our results. Most of the monitoring health units included in the SISVEFLU database are public, and some bias may have been introduced by not including most private health care facilities. However, the economic analysis was made using national estimates and costs estimated from the three largest public health providers, which cover > 90% of the population in Mexico. Out-of-pocket expenses other than the cost of the over-the-counter drug, amantadine, were not considered when making assumptions regarding the economic impact of influenza. This was done in an effort to be conservative and not overestimate the economic benefits of the influenza vaccine; in doing so, we may have under-estimated such benefits. We also acknowledge the importance of careful consideration of the method used for performing an economic analysis. While the assumptions used in our study differ from others recently published [51, 52], we believe that the assumptions behind our estimates are solid and our bias is somewhat controlled as we cite official public pricing. Finally, we realize that the use of estimated incidence rates reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (United States of America) for indirect standardisation of incidence rates for Mexico may not be ideal; however, we thought this was necessary because the SISVEFLU database likely underestimates the number of cases from primary care clinics, lacks the necessary population representation and most type B influenza cases reported in the database do not have lineage analysis (Additional file 1: Supplement 1; Text S1.2). We decided to use data from the US (estimated illness rate only) given the data quality and availability, and because health authorities in both countries recognise that infectious disease dynamics in the region, particularly those in which person-to-person transmission is paramount, exhibit similar epidemiological behaviour [53], possibly owing to the extent of human exchange between the two countries. Retrospective analyses have shown that in the case of the 2009 pandemic influenza, identification in the region could be traced back to near simultaneous origins in both the US and Mexico [54]. More importantly, the general epidemiological behaviour of infectious diseases in the last decade, in terms of timing and viral type, has been very similar [55]. As it is epidemiologically accepted to use surrogate data for indirect rate standardisation when local data are unavailable, provided there are reasonable grounds for doing so, we believe that, because the US is a neighbouring country in the same hemisphere and there are documented similarities in the epidemiological behaviour of the disease in both countries, our decision for considering data from the CDC as the best available source for estimating the incidence of influenza in Mexico is supported.",

            "text": "Our study suggests that influenza in the school-aged population has a relatively low incidence, lethality, and mortality, likely due to a cohort effect resulting from at least a decade of vaccinating against influenza in Mexico. Although the true incidence is probably underestimated, surrogate data allowed us to estimate a reasonable burden of disease for the Mexican population in the last decade, ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 million cases each year for the school-aged population, which represents a substantial economic impact for the health care system. In addition, economic analysis showed that vaccination of the school-aged population is cost-saving. Because this age group represents influenza \u201csuperspreaders\u201d and vaccination is shown to be a cost-effective intervention, expanding the current vaccination schedule to include this age group is supported. The national estimates for Mexico as a middle-income country provided from this study will be of great value for health care decision makers in middle-income countries.",
