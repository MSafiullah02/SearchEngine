            "text": "HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA non-enveloped virus. It is a member of the genus Hepevirus in the family Hepeviridae.22 The HEV genome is approximately 7.2 kb long and contains three open reading frames (ORFs) as well as 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions. ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins, with putative functional domains including methyltransferase, papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains. Besides these, other domains are homologous to other plant and animal positive-strand RNA viruses: Y domain, X or macro domain and the polyproline region (PPR). ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, and ORF3 encodes a small phosphoprotein. Although all HEV isolates are believed to belong to a single serotype,23 phylogenetic analysis of HEV sequences has led to the recognition of at least four major genotypes that infect a variety of mammalian species. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEVs are restricted to humans and transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries. Genotypes 3 and 4 HEVs have an extended host range including humans, pigs and other mammals and are responsible for sporadic cases of hepatitis E in both developing and industrialized countries.2, 3 Genotype 3 HEV has a worldwide distribution whereas genotype 4 HEV is largely confined to Asia. Genotypes 3 and 4 HEV infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked meats such as pig liver sausages or game meats.24, 25\n",

The overall prevalence of antibodies against HEV in rabbits from the United States (36%) was lower than that in rabbits from Gansu and Beijing, China (57% and 55% respectively). By contrast, the prevalence of HEV RNA in serum and fecal samples in rabbits farms in the United States (16.5% and 15.3% respectively) was higher than that on farms in Gansu and Beijing, China (7.5% and 7.0% respectively). Neutralizing antibodies could play a role in this marker pattern.34 Observed differences may be explained by the ages of the rabbits, due to variation in the duration of exposure. The difference may also be explained by housing practices. In the US study, the prevalence of the antibodies was higher in rabbits caged in groups of 2\u20139 than in rabbits caged individually.33 Because HEV is transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route, virus likely spreads easier between cage mates, thus increasing the numbers of HEV-positive rabbits.",

However, the ages of the rabbits \u2013 less than 3 months for farmed rabbits versus over 6 months for wild rabbits- and the tissues tested \u2013 bile for farmed rabbits and liver for wild rabbits \u2013 may explain the observed difference in HEV prevalence. Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that the virus loads in liver and bile samples from swine infected with HEV are similar.38, 39 Although the greater prevalence of HEV in wild rabbit could be linked to their older age, a relationship between the prevalence of HEV in the various farms and warrens and rabbit age could not be tested for because their precise ages were unknown.",

The infection of pigs by rabbit HEV was further verified by effective transmission of the virus recovered from pig feces to naive rabbits. Finally, it has been recently shown that rabbit HEV can replicate efficiently in human cell lines, PLC/PRF/5 and A549 cell lines.42 PLC/PRF/5 cells originating from human hepatocellular carcinoma and A549 cells derived from human lung cancer were previously shown to support efficient propagation of HEV strains not only from human but also from pigs and wild boars. All these data suggest that rabbit HEV may potentially cross the barrier species and infect humans. The identification of HEV receptor would also contribute to better understand the zoonotic transmission of HEV.",

The genome organization of rabbit HEV is similar to those of other mammalians HEVs, with a 5\u2032 untranslated region, followed by ORF1, ORF2, ORF3 which partially overlaps ORF2 and the 3\u2032UTR. ORF3 encodes a 113 amino acid protein, which has a length similar to genotype 3 HEV. Phylogenetic analyses based on ORF1 (\u22481400 bp) (Fig. 1\n) and the full-length genome (Fig. 2\n) indicated that all the rabbit strains from China and France belonged to the same clade. One human strain, TLS-18516-human, clustered with the rabbit strains and appeared to be somewhat different from the 4 major mammalian HEV genotypes and the newly described HEV genotypes from rats and wild boar (Fig. 2). Although the full length sequences of the genomes of the rabbit strains and TLS-18516-human strain are more similar to that of genotype 3 HEV than to those of genotype 1, 2 and 4 HEVs, they do not seem to belong to the established HEV genotype 3 found in humans and swine, as recently suggested.30, 43 Differences in the classification of rabbit HEV could be due to the full-length genomic sequences used as the reference for phylogenetic analyses. Genotype 3 is very diverse, with 10 identified subtypes.44 The analysis included the full-length genomes of subtypes 3f, 3c, and 3e, which account for approximately 74%, 13% and 5% of the human and swine HEV strains circulating in France.45, 46 The other full-length genomes representative of genotype HEV subtypes were also included, but subtypes 3d, 3h, and 3i were not yet available in GenBank. The data indicated that the genomes of rabbit HEV or TLS-18516-human were less than 80% identical with genotype 3 HEV, whatever the method used to align the sequences (Table 1\n). This is compatible with the definition of a new genotype, as previously proposed.31, 32\n",

The X domain corresponds to a macro domain found in the non-structural polyproteins of several positive-stranded viruses such as togaviruses and coronaviruses.49, 50, 51 This domain can bind poly (ADP-ribose) and could play a role in the replication and/or transcription of virus RNA. Whether or not the insertion in the X domain influences the function of the HEV macro domain warrants further investigation. Several determinants, including this insertion, could be important for specifying the host range, zoonotic transmission and pathogenesis of rabbit HEV.47 The characterization of the human HEV strain that is closely related to rabbit HEV supports the potential zoonotic transmission from rabbits to human.",

The identification of a human HEV strain that is closely related to rabbit HEV strains and the ability of rabbit HEV to cause cross species infections in pigs reinforce the potential zoonotic risk of this virus. Further studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of the rabbit reservoir to human HEV infection and disease.",
