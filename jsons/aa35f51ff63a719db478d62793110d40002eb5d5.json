Inclusion criteria were a fever of 38\u00b0C or higher, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrate(s) on chest radiographs, and either a history of exposure to a patient with SARS or absence of response to empirical antimicrobial coverage for typical and atypical pneumonia. Samples were collected with informed consent. In total, 29 SARS patients with paired sera and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were available for the study. The diagnosis of SARS was confirmed in all patients by the presence of antibodies against the novel coronavirus in the serum (4 ). The age of these patients ranged from 24 to 71 years [mean (SD), 45.2 (13.9) years], and the male-tofemale ratio was 11:18. At the time of submitting this manuscript, one of the patients had died. NPA samples were collected by suction into a disposable aspiration trap containing 3 mL of viral transport medium (containing, per liter, 2 g of sodium bicarbonate, 5 g of bovine serum albumin, 200 g of vancomycin, 18 g of amikacin, and 160 U of nystatin in Earle's balanced salt solution). Total RNA from 140 L of each NPA sample was extracted with use of a QIAamp Virus RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), as instructed by the manufacturer, and eluted in 50 L of buffer. For isolating RNA from stool specimens, 140 L of viral transport medium containing suspended stool was subjected to the RNA extraction method described above.",

Taken together, including the initial false-positive case, the realtime quantitative PCR assay was positive in 79% of SARS cases and negative in 98% of controls with and without viral infections. Epidemiologic data suggest that droplet transmission is one of the major routes of transmission of this virus. The detection of live virus (4 ) and the detection of high copy numbers of viral sequence from NPA samples in the current study clearly support that the concept that cough and sneeze droplets from SARS patients are a major route of spread of this infectious agent. At the time of the writing of this manuscript, disposable surgical masks, gloves, and gown are worn by healthcare workers who care for the SARS patients. Interestingly, two of four available stool samples from the SARS patients in this study were positive in the assay (data not shown). It is thus relevant to note that many animal coronaviruses are spread via the fecal-oral route (5 ) . Further studies are required to test whether the virus in feces is infectious.",

However, sequence analyses of available sequences in other regions of the OC43 polymerase gene indicate that the human virus associated with SARS is genetically distinct from OC43. Furthermore, the primers used in this study do not have homology to any sequences from known coronaviruses.

            "text": "Cytokines and chemokines, a superfamily of small cytokine-like molecules, are key mediators of immunity and inflammation. Detection of cytokines and chemokines in disease states provides useful diagnostic tools for inves-tigating host responses to invading organisms, tumors, and trauma.Different reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocols have been described in the literature, including semiquantitative, quantitative, and competitive PCR techniques, but most of them were labor-intensive and time-consuming (1, 2 ) . Recently, real-time PCR assays have become a major tool for quantifying the number of DNA or cDNA copies in different settings and clinical materials. These assays offer a standardized, rapid, accurate, and reproducible method that combines rapid in vitro amplification with real-time quantification of the DNA or cDNA load. However, to date, only limited data are available for quantification of cytokine gene expression (3, 4 ) . In addition, there is a need for rapid, sensitive, reliable, and standardized methods for RNA extraction.Here we present an automated standardized protocol for the extraction of RNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), using the MagNA Pure LC system (Roche Diagnostics), combined with a rapid and easy-to-perform quantitative PCR assay, using the Light-Cycler (Roche Diagnostics) amplification and detection system. We applied this protocol to quantification of mRNA expression of the following immunorelevant genes: interleukin (IL)-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423), interferon-\u2425 (IFN-\u2425), macrophage-inducing protein-3\u2423 (MIP-3\u2423), SCYB-11 (IFN-inducible T-cell-\u2423 chemoattractant; H174; CXCL11), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54), and nuclear factor-B (NFB), the transcription factor and central mediator of immune response.PBMCs were prepared from 50 mL of heparinized fresh venous blood obtained from healthy donors (n \u03ed 30). PBMCs were separated by centrifugation over Ficoll and resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. The PBMC concentration was adjusted to 1 \u03eb 10 6 /mL in RPMI 1640 containing 100 mL/L fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). PBMCs were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 8 h with 10 mL/L phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or 1 mg/L lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2200g. Lysis buffer (200 L) was then added to the pellet, and the resuspended cells were pipetted into the MagNA Pure LC sample cartridge for subsequent RNA extraction.For RNA extraction, we used the MagNA Pure LC RNA Isolation Kit I (Roche Diagnostics). In this automated process, the samples were lysed in a buffer containing a chaotropic salt and a RNase inactivator. Nucleic acids were bound to the surface of glass magnetic particles. After a DNase digestion step, unbound substances were removed by several washing steps, and purified RNA was eluted (elution volume, 100 L) with a low-salt buffer followed by spectrophotometric quantification of RNA.cDNA was synthesized with use of the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, 8 L of RNA substrate, 2.2 L of oligo-p(dT) 15 primer, and 0.8 L of AMV reverse transcriptase were used for cDNA synthesis. After each reverse transcription, cDNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, based on the absorbance at Clinical Chemistry 49, No. 6, 2003 ",
