Because URTIs are common illnesses, there is no reason why high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RTCs) should not be conducted.7 In addition, all families experience these conditions and may have strong personal preferences about treatment. The challenge for the clinician is to make an accurate diagnosis and then to match the effective treatment options with the preferences of the family.",

Because each condition covers a spectrum of disease, the acute presentation of the initial URTI is discussed first and then, when appropriate, interventions for persistent disease or complications of the initial complaint are addressed. Because of the focus on trial evidence, not all the information relevant to an individual decision may be discussed. Furthermore, because the clinical course of participants enrolled in RCTs may be different from the clinical course observed in one's own practice, the overall effects of an intervention may need to be adjusted. Despite these limitations, clinicians using this article should be confident that they understand which interventions have been rigorously assessed and the overall findings of these assessments.",

            "text": "The GRADE Working Group has described the steps required to review evidence.8, 9 Ideally, explicit criteria should be used. Although this process has many advantages in terms of transparency, it does not guarantee that recommendations will be consistent across different sets of evidence-based guidelines (although this consistency is the long-term aim).10 The GRADE Working Group proposes that a recommendation should indicate the decision that the majority of well-informed individuals would make.8 It is difficult to be dogmatic about interventions for self-limited conditions with a low risk of complications. Therefore, the author has tried to provide a summary of evidence to assist discussions with families (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4\n). The author's approach (informed by the best available evidence) is described in Box 1\n.Box 1Suggested approach for assessing and managing a child who has an upper respiratory infection\n1.Take a history of the presenting complaint to elicit the primary symptom: nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis), sore throat (pharyngitis) ear pain, ear discharge, or hearing loss (otitis media). Ask about the frequency and severity of previous URTIs. Clarify the duration of illness and the presence of any associated features, including cough (bronchitis), fever, respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor feeding, or lethargy. Determine the concerns, expectations, and preferences of the child and the caregivers. (Grade: very low; level of evidence: cohort studies and other evidence)2.Examine the child to confirm whether investigation and management should be directed at rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, or AOM. Assess temperature, pulse and respiratory rate, presence and color of nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, facial tenderness, tonsillar enlargement, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, presence of cough, presence of middle ear effusion (using pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry), position and integrity of tympanic membrane, and proptosis. Ensure normal hydration, perfusion, conscious state, and no meningism, periorbital swelling, limitation of eye movements, upper airway obstruction, respiratory distress, or mastoid tenderness. (Grade: very low; level of evidence: cohort studies and other evidence)3.Investigations\u2022Rhinosinusitis: none required unless patient is febrile and less than 3 months of age or danger signs (respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor feeding, or lethargy) are present.(Grade: low; level of evidence: cohort studies)\u2022Pharyngitis: none required unless patient is febrile and less than 3 months of age or danger signs (respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor feeding, or lethargy) are present.(Grade: low; level of evidence: cohort studies)\u2022AOM: none required unless patient is febrile and less than 3 months of age or danger signs (respiratory distress, cyanosis, poor feeding, or lethargy) are present.(Grade: low; level of evidence: cohort studies)\n4.Management\u2022Rhinosinusitis: Provide symptomatic pain relief if indicated during watchful waiting with advice to parents on likely course and possible complications. Antibiotics can be considered if there is persistent nasal discharge for more than 10 days or purulent nasal discharge. Decongestants may be used in an older child who has significant nasal obstruction. (Grade: moderate; level of evidence: RCTs)\u2022Pharyngitis: Provide symptomatic pain relief if indicated during watchful waiting with advice to parents on likely course and possible complications. Antibiotics can be used if pain is severe and does not respond to analgesics, if there is tonsillar exudate plus cervical lymphadenopathy and no nasal discharge or cough, or if the patient is at high risk of complications (especially rheumatic fever or peritonsillar abscess). (Grade: moderate; level of evidence: RCTs)\u2022AOM: Provide symptomatic pain relief if indicated during watchful waiting with advice to parents on likely course and possible complications. Antibiotics can be used if the patient has AOM with perforation or is younger than 2 years old and has bilateral AOM, if there has been no improvement after 48 hours of watchful waiting, or if the patient is at high risk of suppurative complications (especially perforation of the tympanic membrane).

In addition, the operation itself is associated with postoperative pain and some risk of complications. High-quality trials of prophylactic antibiotic treatment have not been done, but this treatment would be a reasonable option for families who want treatment but decide against surgery. Surgery is likely to be most beneficial in children who have very frequent severe infections.

The beneficial effects of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in reducing the rate of insertion of tympanostomy tubes are modest.62 Most children do not fall into this risk group. There also is evidence about the treatment effects of antihistamines and decongestants, antibiotics, myringotomy, and analgesics (see Table 4).46, 50, 51, 63 Regular analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen) provide a benefit (assessment on day 2), and the beneficial effects are large.46 Antibiotics also are effective,49, 51 but in most children the short-term beneficial effects are slight. The beneficial effects are modest in children younger than 2 years old who have bilateral AOM and are large in those who have AOMwiP. Studies of initial treatment with antibiotics have not documented a long-term effect. If antibiotics are to be used, there is evidence that a longer course of treatment (\u2265 7 days) is more effective, but the beneficial effects are modest (persistent AOM reduced from 22% to 15%).64 There is no evidence that any one of the commonly used antibiotics is more effective than the others. The use of antihistamines and decongestants has not been shown to be beneficial, and myringotomy seems to be harmful compared with no treatment or antibiotics (see Table 4).46, 50, 63\n",

The rates of AOM also reduce spontaneously without treatment, so the absolute benefits are less impressive than anticipated. Insertion of tympanostomy tubes also seems to reduce rates of AOM, and the level of effect is similar to that of antibiotics. Either of these options could be considered in children who have very frequent severe infections, especially infections occurring before the peak of respiratory illness in winter. Children who have tympanostomy tubes may develop a discharging ear, however, so tympanostomy tubes are not a good option in children who are at increased risk of suppurative infections (including those who have immunodeficiency or persistent bacterial rhinosinusitis). In these children, prophylactic antibiotics or prompt antibiotic treatment of infections probably is a more appropriate choice. Adenoidectomy does not seem to be an effective treatment.50, 69, 70\n",

Most studies have not documented a long-term effect. Topical antibiotics also seem to be more effective than antiseptics and systemic antibiotics.53 The role of topical antibiotics plus systematic antibiotics is unclear.74 Cleaning the middle ear discharge has not been proven to be effective in RCTs but generally is regarded as necessary before insertion of topical antibiotics (at least in children who have profuse discharge). Although not seen in RCTs, there also is a very small risk of ototoxicity associated with most topical antibiotics (except topical quinolones) and topical antiseptics.50 For children who do not respond to prolonged courses of topical antibiotics, two small studies (85 participants) have documented high cure rates and large beneficial effects associated with 2 to 3 weeks of intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics (such as ceftazidime).75, 76\n",

For children who have persistent OME in both ears associated with hearing loss despite watching waiting for 6 to 12 months, a trial of antibiotics is reasonable. Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is most appropriate in children when the primary concern is conductive hearing loss and communication difficulties. Children who have the most severe conductive hearing loss are most likely to benefit. Children who experience frequent suppurative infections (including those who have immunodeficiency or persistent bacterial rhinosinusitis) are at greatest risk of developing CSOM as a complication of tympanostomy tubes. Families should be informed that a small proportion of children suffer recurrent persistent OME when the tympanostomy tubes are extruded and may need a second operation. In these children, tympanostomy tubes plus adenoidectomy is a reasonable option.79, 80\n",
