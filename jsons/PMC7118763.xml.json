During the days of the opium wars in the mid-19th Century, the British Empire raised its flag and claimed the barren, rocky outcrop of Hong Kong as British territory. Hong Kong Island was formally ceded to Britain by the treaty of Nanjing in 1842, and in 1898, the New Territories were leased to Britain by the Chinese for 99 years.",

As the manufacturing industry flourished, the estimated population grew from 3.93 million in 1971 to 5.11 million in 1981. Despite the pre-handover concerns, the transition to becoming a special administrative region of China has been smooth and successful, and Hong Kong continues to thrive. Rather than suppress its entrepreneurial spirit, Mainland China has provided Hong Kong with positive re-inforcement. Now with a population of 7 million, Hong Kong continues to be a hub of financial activity, a global trading centre, a popular shopping area for Mainlanders, and a favourite stopover location for long-haul flights from all continents. Despite the economic downturn in the late 1990s and the financial impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Hong Kong's economy is booming again and it holds large government reserves.",

Control of communicable diseases is a high priority for the health system. In response to the deficiencies highlighted by the epidemic, a new organization, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP, http://www.chp.gov.hk), was established and it now plays a key role in co-ordinating Hong Kong's preparedness not only within the special administrative region but also with global partners. Methods of food production and the regulation of food hygiene standards are also a priority, and the Centre for Food Safety (http://www.cfs.gov.hk) has been newly established to deal with the health challenges associated with production and preparation of food.",

Fast food has become a staple diet, with many Hong Kongers working long hours and eating out rather than cooking at home. One of the major concerns facing Hong Kong is the impact of urban living. In 2003, the Population Health Survey found that 79.4% of women and 87.1% of men did not include sufficient fruits and vegetables in their daily diet. Health educators within the CHP have promoted a variety of initiatives including their EatSmart campaign, healthy lunch boxes for schools and discussions on food labelling (http://www.cheu.gov.hk). Other aspects of healthy lifestyles have shown progress. For example, the regular surveys from the Department of Health indicate low levels of smoking amongst women (4%), and rates for men had fallen to 26.8% by 2006.8 The bill for designated \u2018no smoking\u2019 areas in public places was introduced successfully on 1 January 2007 and has been deemed successful, although some bars and clubs have been granted temporary exemption until 1 July 2009.9\n",

The system is unique with the majority of primary health care provided privately by a range of practitioners in the community who are paid out of pocket, whilst much secondary care is provided by the Government-funded Hospital Authority. Whilst recognizing the excellence of the hospital sector, the laissez-faire system of primary health care results in doctor shopping, a lack of integration between hospital and community, and concerns over the quality of patient care. In addition, there is minimal participation of private general practitioners in health promotion activities, which are left to the Department of Health. All of these compromise the standards of healthcare provision.10 These concerns are once again being debated in the most recent healthcare reform document (http://www.fhb.gov.hk/beStrong/emain.html).",

Those who have been fascinated with the emergence of China as a world power may well have read Joseph Needham's book, \u2018The Grand Titration\u2019. He describes the many scientific advances first made in China, such as gunpowder, printing, paper, foot stirrups, horse harnesses and other mechanical devices.15 In their portrayal, he sets the scene for the debate between the different scientific philosophies of Eastern Chinese and Western neo-Hellenic scientific development.

The Chinese had inoculated against smallpox since the Song dynasty (AD 960\u20131279), but the method was not entirely satisfactory. When the Jennerian method was introduced in Macau in the mid-19th Century, it was rapidly adopted not only in Hong Kong but also across the whole of Canton.

One such mention was his famous attack on four \u2018pests\u2019: rats, sparrows, flies and mosquitoes, although he later recognized sparrows as inappropriate for the list, and substituted bed bugs in their stead.17 During the 1950s, diseases such as plague, cholera, smallpox, malaria and blackwater fever were gradually eliminated. By 1983, there were an estimated 1.36 million people affected by malaria, a reduction from 30 million. Through a public health campaign, the rates of bilharzia worm infection were also cut dramatically to near disappearance.17 The most important aspect of the bilharzia campaign was education of the public, who, for the most part, participated wholeheartedly in the effort to eradicate the snails from which bilharziasis originates.14 Another achievement includes the reduction of leprosy cases, which in Shandong Province was reduced from 5.07 cases per 100,000 people in 1955 to 0.14 cases per 100,000 people by the early 1980s. Part of the effectiveness of these public health campaigns was due to the mobilization of local people trained in basic public health. In 1975, there were 1.56 million \u2018barefoot doctors\u2019 or village doctors; this equates to approximately 2.5 barefoot doctors per 1000 people in the rural population.18 The barefoot doctors are part-time health workers and provide basic primary, preventive and some curative health care in rural communities.19 Collectively, life expectancy at birth increased dramatically from 35 years in 1949 to 67.9 years in 1981, and the IMR decreased sharply from 200 per 1000 live births in 1949 to 34.7 per 1000 live births in 1981.20\n",

According to the data from national nutrition surveys, the prevalence of obesity and overweight increased by 80% and 47%, respectively, in the 10 years between 1992 and 2002.33 Dynamic analyses of data from four National Surveys on Chinese Students\u2019 Constitution and Health in 1985, 1991, 1995 and 2000 clearly showed the epidemic of overweight and obesity in Chinese children and adolescents.34 From 1991 to 2000, the prevalence of obesity in large cities increased 4.2 times in boys (from 1.3% to 5.4%) and 3.2 times in girls (from 0.9% to 2.9%).

Undoubtedly, one of the biggest dilemmas is in providing an equitable and sustainable healthcare system. The current system, which is heavily reliant on users who pay for medical services, favours the better off. Whilst many other health systems have emulated the community-based outreach healthcare services, latterly known as \u2018barefoot doctors\u2019, these have all but disappeared in China with the introduction of a market-based system. There is no healthcare \u2018safety net\u2019, and many of the rural poor struggle to find accessible and affordable health care. It has been estimated that more than 500 million peasants lack adequate health care and risk impoverishment if they become ill.23 Studies have found more than one-third of the drugs dispensed to rural communities are counterfeit. Not surprisingly, there is little confidence in community-based systems, and building this confidence is one of the major challenges facing the Government.37 In 2006, medical concern was ranked the primary social concern by the public. According to research by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 58% of the Chinese thought it was difficult and expensive to see a doctor.38 The Central Government of China stated, \u2018China's health system has changed greatly and has made much progress since the reform and \u201copening up\u201d, but the problems are still serious. Overall, the reform was unsuccessful\u2019.39 The political response has been to launch a campaign to create a \u2018new socialist countryside\u2019, making the development of healthcare systems\u2014including public health\u2014a priority for the Government.40\n",
