The generally adopted classification system discriminates transudates, modified transudates, and exudates based mainly on protein content and total nucleated cell count (TNCC).\n1\n This classification is not a diagnosis per se, but is useful for establishing differential diagnoses and for patient management. Usually, transudates develop as a response to increased prehepatic hydrostatic vascular pressure or decreased oncotic pressure; modified transudates can develop from long standing transudates, or can be caused by increased hydrostatic pressure or noninflammatory stimuli; and exudates result from increased capillary permeability occurring during inflammation.\n1\n Neoplastic, hemorrhagic, and chylous effusions are characterized by variable and overlapping protein concentrations and TNCCs, but have specific cytologic features that are used in their differentiation. Cytologic examination of effusion fluid is usually performed to evaluate the type and morphology of cells present and to look for a possible etiology. Thus, both enumeration and classification of cells in effusions are important in the diagnostic process.",

However, using automated methods, debris can be counted as cells, and protein\u2010rich fluids may clot and obstruct the instrument.\n3\n Automated differential cell counts are not usually performed on effusions in veterinary laboratories, because microscopic evaluation has been considered necessary for accurate identification of cell type.\n1\n In human pathology, instruments that use immunophenotyping to identify cells can reliably perform total and differential counts in body fluids.\n4\n, \n5\n\n",

RBC and platelet counts are based on impedance, while the WBC count (corresponding to the TNCC) is based on laser methodology and is measured in the DIFF and BASO channels.\n6\n The DIFF channel classifies cells based on complexity and nucleic acid content. The BASO channel classifies cells based on volume and the complexity of cellular residues produced after contact with an acidic reagent that collapses all the nucleated cells except basophils. The Sysmex also calculates a delta (\u0394) WBC (ratio between DIFF and BASO counts), which should be close to 1.\n5\n The Sysmex has been validated for canine and feline blood samples\n7\n; however, we are unaware of studies on its use to analyze effusion fluid.

Only cytologic findings (not physicochemical or macroscopic data) were used to classify the fluids.

Rather, a qualitative cytologic diagnosis was made by 2 independent observers (N.P.C., M.C.) blinded to the Sysmex results. In the case of conflicting classifications, the 2 observers reviewed together the slides to achieve a consensus. Based on the cytologic diagnosis, samples were then grouped into the following categories: transudative (poorly cellular samples, classified cytologically as inconclusive), chylous (samples rich in small lymphocytes), reactive or inflammatory (effusions containing mesothelial cells, macrophages or neutrophils as the predominant cell populations), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP, characterized by increased neutrophils, the presence of mononuclear cells, and a proteinaceous background), round cell neoplasia (including lymphoma), or other neoplasia (carcinoma or mesothelioma).",

Three of these 4 samples were from 2 dogs and 1 cat with neoplasia (2 carcinoma, 1 hemangiosarcoma) and the fourth was from a cat suspected of having FIP based on cytologic examination of the effusion. However, no additional clinicopathological findings consistent with FIP were present in this cat and confirmatory tests were not carried out. Six of the 10 effusions had markedly increased \u0394TNC (mean\u00b1SD=9.19\u00b15.16; median=9.56; range=3.44\u201317.09) and all were from cats with clinicopathologic findings compatible with FIP, including positive immunohistochemical results for feline coronavirus and increased concentrations of acute phase proteins in serum and effusion (data not shown).\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n To further evaluate the cause of the high \u0394TNC in samples from cats with FIP, we added a drop of effusion fluid from 1 cat with FIP to the BASO reagent in the same proportion used by the instrument (1:51, v:v). This resulted in sudden clotting of the fluid, causing a low to nondetectable TNCC (Figure 6).",

Reactive mesothelial cells and neoplastic epithelial cells resulted in similar scattergrams characterized by widely dispersed cells in the region where voluminous cells having high nucleic acid content would be expected (region of intense fluorescence DIFF signal and a high forward scatter BASO signal).
