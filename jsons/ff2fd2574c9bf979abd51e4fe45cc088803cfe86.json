These surviving spirochetes could not be transmitted to healthy mice and some lacked plasmid genes associated with infectivity. By 6 months, antibiotictreated mice no longer tested positive for the presence of B. burgdorferi, and even cortisone immunosuppression failed to alter this result; that is, it failed to activate infection. Nine months after antibiotic treatment, low levels of Borrelia DNA still could be detected in some, but not all of the mice. These findings (19) have indicated that noninfectious B. burgdorferi can persist for a limited time after antibiotic therapy. The implications of these findings to persistent infection and the nature of chronic Lyme disease in humans remain to be assessed.",

The results obtained did not support the involvement of an autoimmune mechanism in PTCLD (24) .

A greater frequency of DRB1 * 0401, which has been reported to be associated with antibiotic-treatmentresistant arthritis, was noted in the case subject patients; although this finding appeared to be nominally significant (p < 0.05), its biological significance is ambiguous because none of the case subjects considered had symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ research/topics/lyme/research/autoimmune/).",

Despite this constraint, there is evidence to indicate that the inactivation and complementation of a gene (bbe16) encoded by a linear plasmid (lp25) plays a major role in the virulence, pathogenesis, and survival of B. burgdorferi during its natural life cycle (36) . This gene, which has been renamed BptA (for borrelial persistence in ticks-gene A), potentiates virulence in mice and is essential for the persistence of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes scapularis ticks. Although BptA appears to be a lipoprotein expressed on the outer surface membrane of B. burgdorferi, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BptA promotes persistence within its tick vector remains to be elucidated. Because BptA appears to be highly conserved (>88% similarity and >74% identity in amino acid sequence) in all B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains examined, it may be widely used to promote persistence in nature. Given the absolute dependence on-and intimate association with-its tick and rodent hosts, BptA must be considered to be a major virulence factor that is critical for B. burgdorferi's overall infectious strategy (7). Strategies designed to block the synthesis or expression of BptA could be of great value in preventing the transmission of Lyme disease.",

            "text": "NIAID-supported investigators have now been able to create various mutant strains of B. burgdorferi and have shown that although OspA and OspB are not required for infection of mice, they were essential for the colonization and survival of B. burgdorferi in ticks (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ research/topics/lyme/research/transmission/). Ixodes scapularis ticks have a receptor on the inner wall of their intestines to which B. burgdorferi is able to bind tenaciously by means of OspA, a cell surface protein. This receptor is called the tick receptor for OspA (TROSPA). Attachment to TROSPA will enable B. burgdorferi to persist in the gut from the time they were ingested by ticks through a subsequent molt, thereby avoiding elimination; this would allow Borrelia to be injected into a new host when the ticks take their next blood meal (38) . When ticks take a blood meal, the production of OspA is downregulated in favor of the increased production of OspC. This results in gut-bound spirochetes becoming detached, which enables them to migrate to the salivary glands, where they can be injected into mammalian hosts. Thus, TROSPA, in addition to other bacterial cell surface components, such as OspA, appears to play a key role in the transmission of Lyme disease to humans. Other studies have shown that if ticks are permitted to feed on mice that have been immunized previously with OspA, or have been treated with the antibody specific for OspA, the attachment and subsequent colonization of ticks by B. burgdorferi would be significantly impaired, if not prevented. This suggests the feasibility of developing oral-or vector-expressed transmission-blocking vaccines that involve the immunization of the intermediate hosts upon which ticks feed (39) . Several NIAID-supported investigators are now examining and testing this approach under controlled laboratory conditions (http://www3.niaid. nih.gov/research/topics/lyme/research/transmission/).",

All of these observations suggest that Salp 15 and/or other tick salivary proteins might be excellent candidates for vaccines to block the transmission of Lyme disease (41) .

These data, as well as differences in the population structure of B. burgdorferi in sympatric ticks and mice, indicated that non-mouse hosts contributed more toward infecting ticks than previously expected.

B. burgdorferi strains exhibit various degrees of infectivity and pathogenicity in mammals, which may be due to their relative ability to evade initial host immunity. Innate immune cells recognize B. burgdorferi by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that use the intracellular molecule myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) to mediate effector functions (46) . In a mouse model of Lyme disease using mutant strains of mice, the absence of MyD88 was found to facilitate tick-transmission of strains of B. burgdorferi of both low and high infectivity (47) . The reported data will broaden the understanding of factors that contribute the degree of pathogenicity observed between different clinical isolates of B. burgdorferi, as well as the genetic basis for host resistance or susceptibility to infection.",

The overall architecture of these two rickettsial genomes is essentially the same, with the exception of a few rearrangements near the terminus of replication. Symmetric DNA inversions at the regions surrounding the origins of replication and termination have been observed also in Chlamydia (50) . The symmetric nature of these rearrangements is thought to be the outcome of recombination events at the open replication forks. Such translocation and inversion events have since been identified in a variety of genomes, suggesting that the replicating DNA at the open replication fork is particularly vulnerable to recombination events (49).",

Morulae can be stained with conventional Wright or Giemsa stains and are occasionally observed in leukocytes in smears of peripheral blood, buffy coat preparations, or cerebrospinal fluid. Although a routine blood smear can provide a presumptive clue for early diagnosis because of the visualization of morulae, still a confirmatory testing for Ehrlichia or Anaplasma species is required by serology, PCR, or immunostaining methods. Also important to note is that the available methodology to demonstrate morulae in blood smears is not very sensitive, and a case of ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis might be missed if the diagnosis relies solely on detecting morulae on blood smears. Although the diagnostic sensitivity of blood smears is greater for HGA than for HME, blood smears might only be positive in up to 60% of patients with HGA (59).",

Humans are not a primary reservoir for R. rickettsii but are merely secondary hosts that enter the organism's life cycle tangentially through contact with arthropods. For humans to become infected with rickettsiosis, a tick may need to be attached for as little as 6 to 8 hours. However, attachment of 24 hours or more is generally needed for transfer of the disease (1). Human infection may also result from contact with contaminated tick fluid and tissues during tick removal or from laboratory contact during culture and isolation.",

Manifestations of the disease are diverse and may range from asymptomatic to fulminant, leading to prolonged illness and even death. Although in the United States most cases of babesiosis are subclinical, when patients become symptomatic, manifestations usually appear after an incubation period of 1 to 6 weeks. The most common symptoms include fever (85% of patients), fatigue (79%), chills (63%), and headache (39%). Less often, myalgia, anorexia, cough, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, emotional liability, depression, sore throat, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection, photophobia, and weight loss have been reported (82) . Physical findings are generally nonspecific (high fever, mild splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly). Unlike other tick-borne infections, rash is not common in babesiosis. The most common complications in patients with severe babesiosis are acute respiratory failure (21% of patients), disseminated intravascular coagulation (18%), heart failure (12%), coma (9%), and renal failure (6%). Babesiosis is fatal in 5% to 9% of cases (83) .",
