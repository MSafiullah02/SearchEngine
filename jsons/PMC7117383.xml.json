The early experiments (reviewed by Kruiningen et al., 1985) were performed before the etiological role of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was elucidated, and since the BCV antibody status of the animals could not be determined it is conceivable that clinical disease was inconsistently produced. Recently, WD reproduction was attempted in BCV seropositive cows, but diarrhoea could only be produced by inoculation through a duodenal catheter after immunosuppression using serial dexamethasone injections and/or large amounts of iced water orally (Tsunemitsu et al., 1999).",

Yet, in WD outbreaks calves often are clinically unaffected (Rollinson, 1948, Hedstrom and Isaksson, 1951, Roberts, 1957, Traven et al., 1993). Antigenic differences between BCV strains isolated from diarrhoeic calves and from cows with WD have been sought in experimental cross-protection studies (Reynolds et al., 1985, El-Kanawati et al., 1996), as well as in vitro by use of panels of antisera and monoclonal antibodies applied in functional and cross-reactivity tests (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995, Dea et al., 1995), complemented with sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin esterase gene (Milane et al., 1997). However, no consistent differences between cow- and calf-derived BCV strains have been found so far. The objective of this experiment was to reproduce WD in BCV-seronegative lactating cows and to infect milk-fed BCV-seronegative calves with the same strain of the virus and to compare the outcome between the cows and the calves with respect to clinical disease, faecal excretion of the virus, isotype-specific antibody and interferon type 1 responses in serum, milk and nasal secretions.",

Two days after inoculation, calf 306 was brought to the experimental unit and kept for 1 h in each of the cows\u2019 pens. Then the four experimental calves were kept together with calf 306 for 1 h in a cow-size pen. Each experimental animal had direct nose contact with calf 306 and each animal also had nose contact with faeces from calf 306.

Many similarities in the disease outcome and some differences were seen between the cows and the calves.

All cattle used in this experiment were seronegative to BCV. The contribution of predisposing factors to outbreaks of WD has been widely assumed (Campbell and Cookingham, 1978). In this experiment, however, there were no obvious predisposing events, e.g. adverse weather: the infection was done in the beginning of May; stress: the cows were installed and accustomed to the ration several weeks before the trial; preceding infections: the mild respiratory infection and the sinusitis occurred well in advance of the trial.",

BCV faecal shedding also was detected in all the calves. Among the advantages of this virus transmission model is that the virus infectivity and virulence are better retained by the use of a faecal sample instead of a cell cultured inoculum. Virus grown in cell culture goes through a selection and adaptation process where virulence and pathogenecity factors promoting the infection in vivo may be modified. For example, the cell culture passaged virus widely used in experimental BRSV infections have caused much milder symptoms than those described after natural infections (Kimman et al., 1987, Elvander et al., 1998). The second main advantage of this trial design is that the use of an experimentally inoculated transmitter calf mimics the natural way of transmission as closely as possible, ensuring that the virus reaches the proper host cell and that the host response to infection follows the scheme of a natural infection. This is of particular importance, since the mode of transmission in natural WD is not fully known. By keeping the experimental cattle as a herd in a shared stable unit, the model allows for circulation and recirculation of BCV, which may be an important feature of the natural BCV disease, since BCV is a highly contagious infection. The model, however, depends on the transmitter calf effectively propagating the virus. The use of a group of transmitter calves would compensate for individual differences and further improve the model.",

The transmitter calf was much more physically active when inside the pens of the two cows that developed the most severe diarrhoea than when it was in contact with the two less affected cows. Physical activity of both carrier and recipient with frequent contacts is likely to increase the viral dose transmitted by aerosol and by oral/nasal contact with nasal secretions and faeces of the carrier calf. Differences in activity were not obvious in the calf group and differences in severity of the calf disease may, apart from viral dose, be linked to age, since severe BCV calf diarrhoea is usually described only during the first weeks of life (Torres-Medina et al., 1985, Mostl, 1990).

These results concur with previous reports of a BCV-strain isolated from adult cows with WD causing diarrhoea in colostrum-deprived and gnotobiotic calves (El-Kanawati et al., 1996). The calf diarrhoea seen in this experiment was more frequent and more severe than is usually reported from WD outbreaks. The BRV infection probably contributed to the severity of the diarrhoea in the youngest calf, which excreted BRV during the diarrhoea. Also, the preceding BRV infection, although subclinical, may have aggravated the diarrhoea elicited by the BCV infection in the other calf that developed watery diarrhoea. The BRV infection in these calves underlines the multifactorial pathogenesis of neonatal calf diarrhoea, possibly explaining the variable diarrhoea frequency in young calves in natural WD outbreaks. The feeding of BCV antibody negative milk during the entire clinical study period may also have contributed to a more pronounced calf diarrhoea in this experiment than in natural WD outbreaks (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1993). Most Swedish dairy calves are raised on a milk replacer, usually containing a moderate level of BCV-specific IgG1 antibodies (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n, unpublished observations).

These results suggest that seronegative conventional calves, even without being fed specific milk antibodies, are less severely affected by a BCV infection than seronegative cows. The difference in disease possibly reflects differences in intestinal virus replication and cell destruction between lactating cows and calves, which may be influenced by the ration, a field for further research. Unaffected general condition in BCV-infected calves, as in this experiment, probably leads to an underestimation of the calf diarrhoea frequency in natural WD outbreaks reported (Rollinson, 1948, Hedstrom and Isaksson, 1951, Roberts, 1957, Traven et al., 1993). This study supports the view that the same strains of BCV cause WD and calf diarrhoea outbreaks. As a matter of fact, evidence for differences between WD and calf diarrhoea BCV isolates is lacking (Reynolds et al., 1985, El-Kanawati et al., 1996, Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995, Dea et al., 1995, Milane et al., 1997).",

In two cows, the BRSV antibody response was detected early, indicating that these cows became infected with BRSV at about the same time as BCV was introduced.

The early serum IgM antibody response of calves (2 dpi) detected in this study is consistent with results in mice where antigen-specific IgM producing cells were found in the spleen at 3 days after immunization, the earliest samples obtained (Buiting et al., 1996). In experimental infections of calves, weak faecal BRV-specific IgM was first detected on 5 dpi (BRV, Saif and Smith, 1985), and serum and local BRSV-specific IgM on 6 dpi (Kimman et al., 1987, Kimman et al., 1989, Westenbrink and Kimman, 1987). Contributing to early detection is a sensitive test. These very early IgM antibodies, only detected in calves, may signify an initial T cell independent response. A potent innate immune system has been shown in neonatal rodents and humans in contrast to the low capacity for T cell dependent antibody responses (Marshall-Clarke et al., 2000). Further, viruses of several different types and families, and possessing repeated antigenic determinants, elicit T cell independent IgM responses in mice (Bachmann and Zinkernagel, 1996).",

The correlation between age and the duration of the serum IgA antibody response (Table 3) confirms previous findings (N\u00e4slund et al., 2000), probably reflecting a more efficient induction of IgA memory in the cows compared with the calves and in the older calves compared with the younger ones. Interestingly, IgA antibodies were maintained in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6-month study period, but the protective value is difficult to assess since such studies are lacking. The low and sporadic occurrence of BCV-specific IgG in nasal secretions indicates minimal serum transudation, caused by sampling or inflammation, confirming the local origin of the consistently detected IgA response. The late occurrence (6\u20137 wpi) of the highest specific IgA values (\u201c2nd peak\u201d in Table 5) in nasal secretions of three cows and one calf may indicate prolonged viral replication or recirculation of the virus within the experimental herd. The contribution to this finding by variations in total IgA content due to dilution through increasing amount of nasal secretions seems less likely, because nasal discharge during the early IgA antibody response was observed in both cows and calves. Also, the only cow showing markedly increased nasal secretions had the highest level of BCV-specific nasal IgA. Some investigators relate the level of specific IgA to total IgA for quantification and comparison of specific IgA responses in secretions (Hordnes et al., 1997, Berstad et al., 1997) to circumvent an unknown dilution factor introduced by the sampling. In this study the tampon sampling technique was used, resulting in undiluted secretions, therefore the level of specific IgA should be more comparable between samples.",

High titres of IFN were detected both locally, in the upper respiratory tract, and systemically in this study. These findings concur with the efficient IFN induction shown in vivo for another coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine (Bonnadi\u00e8re and Laude, 1981) and in vitro for many coronaviruses, including BCV (Baudoux et al., 1998). Fever and leucopenia are rapidly occurring, reversible side-effects of IFN type 1 treatment in humans (Quesada, 1992). In this experiment fever, leucopenia and the EVF decrease strikingly coincided with the serum IFN peak, indicating that these symptoms may be mediated by IFN. The low IFN level detected in serum of the youngest calf on the day of BCV infection was probably induced by the rotavirus infection (Broecke et al., 1984). The weak second IFN peak in serum or nasal secretions from some cattle may indicate recirculation of BCV within the group. IFN detection in bovine milk has not been reported previously, to the authors\u2019 knowledge. Detectable milk IFN titres were retained for 6 days in three out of four cows, but the low level of the response, probably due to dilution, may limit utilisation of milk IFN as an infection marker.",

            "text": "It is unlikely that the non-specific responses to the BCV infection (IFN, fever, early leucopenia) were influenced by the BRSV infection, since the non-specific responses were highly synchronised in all cattle showing such responses, corresponding to the highly synchronised BCV-specific antibody isotype responses that indicated the establishment of a homogenous BCV infection. The BRSV seroresponses, on the other hand, were more divergent (seroconversions on days 9\u201328), indicating a slower transmission of BRSV within the experimental herd or a delayed replication of, or response to, BRSV caused by the BCV infection as previously shown with BVDV (Elvander et al., 1998). Furthermore, there was no difference in the non-specific responses (or in the clinical outcome) between the two cows that seroresponded early to BRSV and the two that responded more than 1 week later. Concerning the capacity of respiratory syncytial viruses to induce interferon type 1, Elvander et al. (1998) failed to detect IFN in serum of calves experimentally infected with BRSV, concurring with the poor IFN inducing capacity shown by human RSV in vitro (Roberts et al., 1992) and in vivo (Collins et al., 1996). The rotavirus infection may have contributed to the IFN response detected in the calf shedding BRV during the diarrhoea, but not in the other calf, since BRV shedding stopped before the IFN was detected. These two calves showed neither fever, nor leucopenia. The decrease in milk yield occurred simultaneously in all the cows, indicating that it was brought about by the BCV infection. The BRSV infection possibly prolonged the subnormal yield level somewhat in the cow that showed more pronounced respiratory symptoms, but no obvious influence was seen comparing the individual yield recovery (Fig. 2).",

However, seronegative conventionally reared calves are less severely affected by BCV infection than seronegative, lactating cows. Co-infections or sequential infections with other enteric pathogens, like the rotavirus infection in some of the calves in this study, probably are important under field conditions for the development of severe calf diarrhoea from BCV infection. This assumption is in accord with the well-established multifactorial etiology of neonatal calf diarrhoea.",
