            "text": "The genome of SARS CoV-2 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) [4] is similar to the genome of the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003 (SARS CoV, NCBI Reference sequence: NC_004718.3) [5, 6]. Much of the understanding of the proteins found in SARS CoV-2 are based on the numerous research studies reported on SARS CoV and other related viruses (e.g. MERS CoV) [7, 8]. However, among the recent coronavirus outbreaks in the new millennium (SARS CoV: 2002\u20132003, MERS CoV: 2012, SARS CoV-2: 2020), SARS CoV-2 mysteriously had the most devastating global impact. Understanding the proteins present in these viruses enable a more rational approach to designing more effective antiviral drugs [9, 10]. The majority of proteins of SARS CoV have been characterized in detail. The proteins of SARS CoV consist of two large polyproteins: ORF1a and ORF1ab (that proteolytically cleave to form 16 nonstructural proteins), four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and eight accessory proteins: ORF3a, ORF3b (NP_828853.1, not present in SARS CoV-2), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8a, ORF8b, and ORF9b (NP_828859.1, not present in SARS CoV-2). Although accessory proteins have been viewed as dispensable for viral replication in vitro, some have been shown to play an important role in virus-host interactions in vivo [11]. Similar to SARS CoV, SARS CoV-2 lacks the hemagglutinin esterase gene, which is found in human coronavirus (hCoV) HKU1, a lineage A betacoronavirus [3]. The spike protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid protein, 3CL protease, papain like protease, RNA polymerase, [10] and helicase protein have been suggested to be viable antiviral drug targets [12]. SARS CoV-2 is an RNA virus and its RNA genome is 30 kb in length. SARS CoV-2 is thought to have originated from its closest relative, BatCov RaTG13 (GenBank: MN996532), [13] which was isolated from horseshoe bats [14].",

With such a long sequence, it possesses several conserved domains: ssRNA binding, ADPr binding, G-quadruplex binding, ssRNA binding, protease (papain-like protease), and NSP4 binding), and transmembrane domain. Among the 16 nonstructural proteins, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 have transmembrane domains [18]. The papain like protease 1 (PL1 protease) of alpha coronavirus (alpha CoV) Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), which is part of NSP3, was shown to cleave the site between NSP2 and NSP3. Furthermore, this papain like protease domain is responsible for the release of NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 from the N-terminal region of polyproteins 1a and 1ab from coronaviruses [19]. Considering this important protease activity to release essential proteins for viral activity, the inhibition of NSP3 protease activity is an important target for antiviral activity [20]. Tanshinones, a class of natural products have been found to inhibit NSP3 protease activity.",

SARS CoV spike mouse polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS CoV-2 spike protein mediated entry into cells [47]. Interestingly, a furin cleavage site (highlighted in Fig. 17: QTQTNSPRRARSVASQSIIA) was located in the S protein of SARS CoV-2, which was lacking in the S protein of SARS CoV. This difference in site could possibly explain the difference in pathogenicity of these two viruses [47].",
