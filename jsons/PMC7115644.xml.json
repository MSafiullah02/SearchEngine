Several interferon inducers such as amizon [9], arbidol [10], [11], primavir (cycloferon) [12], [13] and amixine (tilorone) [14], [15] were successfully introduced into clinical practice in Ukraine. Among these, tilorone showed a high preventive and therapeutic efficacy for a wide spectrum of infectious agents. It is known [16] that tilorone is capable of intercalating between the DNA base pairs with its planar tricyclic fragment [17], [18], and it has been suggested that this intercalation into DNA is the most probable mechanism of interferon induction [19], [20]. Significant interferon inducing properties have also been reported for intercalating derivatives of fluorene [20], [21], acridine [22], [23], anthraquinone [24] and phenanthroline [25]. Regarding the above, the search of interferon inducers among low-molecular weight polycyclic carbo- and heteroaromatic compounds, capable of forming complexes with nucleic acids due to intercalation is a perspective direction in the area of antiviral therapy.",

On the one hand, these differences are in agreement with the Denny's conception about minimal intercalators, based on the terms of planar area size. According to this conception planar part of 10a\u201311e is really larger than that of 6a\u20137e\n[37]. Though, in case of planar conformation realization of the 6a\u20137e, these compounds have even more number of the \u201cheavy atoms\u201d (C, N, O) coplanar with benzoimidazole ring than tetracyclic 10a\u201311e. On the other hand, possibility of rotation about Ph-BIm single bond in 2-phenylbenzoimidazole allows realization of a set of non-planar conformations in non-bound by DNA molecule, and only planar conformation can be realized in the intercalative complex. Decreasing of the possible conformations number of 6a\u20137e under intercalation has to decrease the enthropic increment in the total intercalation free energy. The last one also may be regarded as a reason for the affinity decreasing of 2-phenylbenzoimidazoles 6a\u20137e comparatively to benzoimidazo-quinazolines 10a\u201311e. Further clarification of the observed difference in DNA affinity of 2-phenylbenzoimidazoles and benzoimidazo-quinazolines needs additional investigations, which are in progress.",
