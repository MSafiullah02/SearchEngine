It seemed highly infectious and resistant to therapy, causing considerable concern amongst physicians. Within a month, 41 patients had been admitted to a single hospital and one had died. The initial cases were strongly associated with the Huanan seafood market, in which exotic animals were sold for food. The market was closed, but it was several weeks before public health officials were able to introduce strong public health quarantine measures in the local area.",

By early January 2020 the virus was identified and the sequence determined. The virus (termed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat\u2010SLCoVZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4]. From the first cohort of patients, 8 complete genomes were 99.9% identical in sequence. Given that the typical RNA coronavirus evolves at a rate of 104 nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [4]. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands, surfaces and aerosolised droplets; extensive human\u2010to\u2010human transmission is evident, with clusters of infected families and medical staff [5]. The number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly, at a rate that far outstripped the rate of rise of cases of SARS in 2002/3, raising serious global health concerns. By the 21st January, COVID\u201019 cases were widespread across mainland China, soon spreading beyond the Chinese borders.",

Clearly, many are still suffering from COVID\u201019 and may or may not recover. This is only a small fraction of the total population of China (1,428 million), and strenuous efforts continue to limit spread. However, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has now spread to 29 countries, the Republic of Korea having the 2nd highest number of cases (893 cases with 8 deaths) [6]. In the UK there have been 13 confirmed cases, 8 of whom have recovered and been discharged home. As of 25th of February 2020, 276 cases and 7 deaths have been identified in 7 EU/EEA countries. The majority of these cases have been from a spike in locally acquired cases in Italy resulting in 6 deaths. Iran has also had a recent increase in cases with 61 cases and 12 deaths [7, 8].",

The general fatality rate is currently uncertain but could be as high as 1\u20132% of all infections; however, as more cases are found with mild or unapparent disease this rate is expected to fall. The average incubation period is around 5 days, but also appears quite variable and may be as long as two weeks [3]. With around 60,000 active cases awaiting a final outcome, the case fatality amongst those with COVID\u201019 is difficult to determine at the present time. One case in Egypt is the first detected in Africa, while many developing, low resource, countries have had no cases. This apparently low transmission rate to such countries might be a consequence of public health measures enforced to limit spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in China, or could reflect the limited diagnostic capacity in low resource settings.",

One of the first measures taken by the local authorities was alerting the WHO within 4 weeks from the first patient being identified. This is in stark contrast to the SARS outbreak when it took 4 months. The identification of a novel coronavirus in the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 outbreak was quickly followed by the closure of the Huanan market, with the aim of preventing any further zoonotic transmission. During the SARS outbreak there was a delay in identifying the civet as a reservoir for the disease and civets continued to be sold on food markets. Steps such as closing the market has encouraged identification and reduction of transmission from potential animal sources and the WHO has advised that caution should be taken to avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals [6].",

However, with such widespread distribution both within and outside China, it seems likely that subsequent outbreaks will continue to be seen. Crucially there are substantial gaps in our knowledge regarding the epidemiology of disease, the major predisposing risks, transmission rates, clinical manifestations and phenotypes and treatment options. However, we have learnt much from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, which influenced the local and global response to the current outbreak. Our ability to rapidly identify novel pathogens using whole genome sequencing and to develop PCR based diagnostic tests from this data has expedited our ability to identify cases and understand the epidemiology of disease much earlier in the epidemic. This has informed the current strategy of reducing human to human transmissions, especially to healthcare professionals.",

These case definitions vary slightly in different countries and Public Health England (PHE) include clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia, specific symptoms of breathlessness or cough, or anyone with a fever who has a history of travel to the listed countries [15].",

Specimens should be tested for routine bacterial and viral infections, as well as using both upper and lower respiratory tract samples to test for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. This should be performed using real time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT\u2010PCR). Serological tests are in development but should only be used if RT\u2010PCR is not available [16].

The current published data indicates a long mild incubation period followed by rapid progression of disease with 8 days being the median time from initial symptoms to the onset of breathlessness, 9 days to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 10.5 days to admission to intensive care [1]. In one study of 99 cases, 17% developed ARDS, 13% required non\u2010invasive respiratory support, 4% needed invasive ventilation and 3% needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [2]. Tools such as the MuLBSTA Score, which incorporates risk factors and comorbidities such as smoking, hypertension, age, bacterial co\u2010infections, lymphopenia and areas of the lung involved, may be useful to predict mortality in patients with viral pneumonia [2, 17].",

            "text": "The SARS and MERS epidemics, and our treatment of other endemic and epidemic respiratory viruses, can provide some guidance on treatment strategies that may benefit patients with COVID\u201019. There are currently no specific anti\u2010COVID\u201019 therapies but over 80 clinical treatment trials have been initiated to tackle COVID\u201019 [18]. These trials include the HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (protease inhibitors that have been reported to reduce SARS and MERS replication), and also remdesivir (an approved reverse transcriptase inhibitor that similarly has demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 [19]). It may also be possible to enhance the protective host immune response to infection, or inhibit immunopathogenesis (which is thought to contribute to disease severity for some respiratory pathogens). In particular, \u2018cytokine storms\u2019 are thought to be major contributors to the severity of many lower respiratory tract infections, such as influenza [20] and SARS [21]. Host\u2010targeted therapies might therefore be aimed at either enhancement of innate immune clearance of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 or inhibition of inflammatory damage to the airway and the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias. In the first 41 cases, 22% were given systemic corticosteroids, with the aim of suppressing inflammation induced lung injury [1]; however, current WHO guidelines do not recommend their use and data from SARS and MERS showed that corticosteroids did not reduce mortality and potentially delayed viral clearance [22, 23, 24]. Alternative strategies under investigation include immunomodulation with chloroquine (which might also have anti\u2010viral function [19]), monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins. These interventional studies, in addition to observational studies, will develop our understanding of severe COVID\u201019 infections, particularly the relative contribution of viral load and sequence (though current data indicate little strain variation amongst cases so far), bacterial co\u2010infections, host genetics, environmental factors and immunopathogenesis (Figure 1).",

The transparency demonstrated in the rapid sharing of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genetic information has been critical in mediating a global approach to minimise the spread of disease. This has enabled the rapid development of diagnostic tests and their global implementation. In turn these diagnostic tests have facilitated the management of cases in those areas most affected, and the identification of cases in other countries, all of which has aided in limiting the global spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. However, current evidence indicates that these public health measures alone may be insufficient to eliminate COVID\u201019. New treatments are urgently needed and the time that public health measures have bought us must be used productively. Ongoing clinical trials of existing drugs may provide further breakthroughs in limiting morbidity and mortality, but vaccines and prophylactics may be needed to prevent the spread of infections.",
