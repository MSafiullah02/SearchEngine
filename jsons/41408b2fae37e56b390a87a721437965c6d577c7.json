A number of DNA and RNA viruses encode proteins that target critical cell cycle regulators to achieve cellular conditions that are benefi cial for viral replication. Many DNA viruses induce quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle; this is thought to increase pools of deoxynucleotides and thus, facilitate viral replication.

Cell cycle arrest may inhibit early cell death of infected cells, allow the cells to evade immune defenses, or help promote virus assembly. Although benefi cial for the viral life cycle, virus-mediated alterations in normal cell cycle control mechanisms could have detrimental effects on cellular physiology and may ultimately contribute to pathologies associated with the viral infection, including cell transformation and cancer progression and maintenance.

During G1, the cell prepares to replicate its DNA; synthesis of the mRNAs and proteins necessary for DNA synthesis also occurs. The fi rst major checkpoint of the cell cycle, which is present at the G1/S border, is known as the restriction point; if this checkpoint is not activated and the growth signal is still present, the cell proceeds into S phase, the stage during which DNA synthesis and duplication of the cell genome occurs. Once the cell enters S phase, DNA replication is completed regardless of the removal of the growth signal or the presence of DNA damage. After DNA replication is completed, the cell enters the G2 phase and prepares for mitosis, cell division. The G2 phase provides an opportunity for the cellular machinery to check for any DNA damage that may have accumulated during DNA replication. Therefore, cell cycle progression into the S phase and mitosis is controlled by the checkpoints at G1 and G2, respectively. Once the appropriate signals that are required for cell cycle progression are present, the cell enters into the M phase [ 20 , 21 ] . A third checkpoint, referred to as the spindle checkpoint, exists after metaphase and prior to anaphase, which are steps during mitosis that are required for cell division. At this checkpoint, the cell employs strategies to detect improper alignment of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle. If improper alignment of chromosomes is detected, the cell cycle is stopped in metaphase; however, if the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle apparatus, the cell continues into anaphase, completes the cell cycle, and eventually generates two daughter cells [ 20 , 24 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1140, "end": 1151, "text": "[ 20 , 21 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1724, "text": "[ 20 , 24 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An Overview of the Cell Cycle"}, {"text": "Various cellular proteins regulate the transition from one phase of the cell cycle to the next phase. Key regulatory proteins that control cell cycle progression are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated at specifi c points in the cell cycle. There are fi ve CDKs that have been associated with cell cycle progression in mammalian cells: CDKs 4 and 6, which are active during the early G1 phase; CDK2, which is active in the late G1 and S phase; CDK1, which is active during the G2 and M phases; and CDK7, which acts in combination with cyclin H as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK) (Fig. 1 ) . The activity of CDKs is highly regulated and requires the expression of activating cyclins and phosphorylation of the cyclin-CDK complex. CDK expression levels remain stable throughout the cell cycle. In contrast to CDK expression, cyclin levels rise and fall depending on the phase of the cell cycle, enabling cyclins to periodically activate the CDKs [ 20 , 21 ] . The D type cyclins, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3, bind to CDK4 and CDK6 to activate these CDKs. Activation of CDK4 and CDK6 is required for entry into the G1 phase [ 25 , 26 ] . Cyclin D is synthesized as long as the growth factor stimulation is present [ 27 ] . Cyclin E associates with CDK2 to regulate progression from G1 into S phase [ 28 ] . During the S phase, cyclin A binds to CDK2 to regulate S-phase progression, and during the G2 and M phases, cyclin A binds to CDK1 to promote entry into the M phase [ 29 , 30 ]. An additional cyclin, cyclin B, is expressed during mitosis; cyclin B binds to CDK1 to regulate the remainder of mitosis. Cyclins are rapidly degraded by proteasomes when the cell cycle has progressed beyond the phase during which their expression is required [ 20 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1024, "end": 1035, "text": "[ 20 , 21 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1220, "text": "[ 25 , 26 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1305, "text": "[ 27 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1389, "text": "[ 28 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1566, "text": "[ 29 , 30", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1836, "text": "[ 20 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 659, "end": 668, "text": "(Fig. 1 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "An Overview of the Cell Cycle"}, {"text": "Complete CDK activity is dependent upon cyclin expression and binding to the CDK as well as the phosphorylation of the CDK by the cyclin H-CDK7 complex, also referred to as the CAK.

CDK4 activation requires phosphorylation of threonine 172 of CDK4, activation of CDK2 requires phosphorylation of threonine 160 of CDK2, and CDK1 activation requires phosphorylation of threonine 161 of CDK1 [ 20 ] . Phosphorylation of the cyclin-CDK complexes can also inhibit CDK activity. The cyclin A-CDK1 complex can be inhibited by phosphorylation of CDK1 at tyrosine 15 and/or threonine 14 by the kinases Wee1 and Myt1.

The G2/M checkpoint, which is activated in response to DNA damage and incomplete genome replication, induces a G2 arrest and prevents entry into mitosis [ 44 -46 ] . The ultimate goal of the G2/M checkpoint is to inhibit the cyclin B-CDK1 complex, which is referred to as the mitosis-promoting kinase complex (Fig. 1 ) . Progression of the cell cycle from the G2 phase to mitosis, M phase, requires the activation of CDK1. During the G2 phase, cyclin B accumulates and forms a complex with CDK1. The cyclin B-CDK1 complex, also referred to as the M-CDK complex, is kept inactivated by phosphorylation of a pair of inhibitory sites on CDK1; phosphorylation is catalyzed by the Wee1 kinase. During the late G2 phase, the dephosphorylation of CDK1 by the Cdc25C phosphatase activates the cyclin B-CDK1 complex, which triggers entry into the M phase ( Fig. 1 ) . Thus, a balance between the activities of the Wee1 kinase and the Cdc25C phosphatase can regulate the entry of cells into mitosis. Interestingly, Cdc25C can be partly activated by CDK1, and the inhibitory Wee1 kinase may be inhibited by the active M-CDK complex. Since M-CDK can activate its own activator and inhibit its own inhibitor, this suggests that the activation of M-CDK in mitosis involves positive feedback loops [ 42 , 44 ] . The cyclin B-CDK1 complex must be in the nucleus to phosphorylate the substrates that are required during mitosis [ 47 ] . The cyclin B-CDK1 complex can enter the nucleus in the G2 phase; however, since its rate of nuclear export exceeds its rate of nuclear import, the cyclin B-CDK1 complex is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The inhibition of nuclear export of the cyclin B-CDK1 complex leads to nuclear accumulation of the active complex, which promotes entry into mitosis [ 8 , 44 ] . The cyclin B-CDK1 complex can be inactivated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which targets cyclin B for degradation. The ubiquitination of cyclin B by APC, which leads to its degradation, is essential for the cells to exit mitosis [ 44 , 48 ] . The activity of APC is regulated by interaction with either of two coactivator proteins, cell division cycle protein 20 (Cdc20) or Cdc20 homologue 1 (Cdh1), both of which act on different phases of the cell cycle [ 49 -52 ] . PP2A can inhibit APC through its interaction with Cdc20 [ 53 -55 ] . Finally, progression through mitosis requires that spindle fi bers attach to chromatids via a complex of proteins called the kinetochores that help pull the sister chromatids apart, which is essential for chromosome segregation [ 8 , 50 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 371, "text": "[ 44 -46 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1502, "text": "[ 42 , 44 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1625, "text": "[ 47 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 2001, "text": "[ 8 , 44 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2275, "text": "[ 44 , 48 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2501, "text": "[ 49 -52 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2560, "end": 2570, "text": "[ 53 -55 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2801, "end": 2811, "text": "[ 8 , 50 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 526, "text": "(Fig. 1 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1064, "text": "Fig. 1 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Positive Regulators of Cell Cycle Progression"}, {"text": "Cdc25C is usually cytoplasmic but translocates to the nucleus before the M phase. However, when Cdc25C is bound to 14-3-3 proteins, Cdc25C is sequestered in the cytoplasm, which prevents it from activating the cyclin B-CDK1 complex [ 56 ] . In the presence of DNA damage or stalled DNA replication forks, it is critical for the cells to prevent mitotic entry. Depending upon the type of DNA damage, ATM or ATR is activated, which in turn phosphorylates Chk2 or Chk1, leading to their activation. Both Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate Cdc25C on serine residue 216 of Cdc25C, which facilitates binding of Cdc25C to 14-3-3 proteins. Thus, Chk1-and Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25C causes cytoplasmic sequestration of Cdc25C and prevents the activation of CDK1. The checkpoint control regulators, ATM-Chk2 or ATR-Chk1, respond to conditions such as DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication and arrest cells in the G2 phase. These checkpoint pathways can also prevent the nuclear accumulation of cyclin B-CDK1 complexes. Finally, the cyclin B-CDK1 complex can be inhibited following activation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. p53 upregulates the expression of p21, which can bind to cyclin B1-CDK1 complexes and inhibit their kinase activity. Further, p53 can also inhibit CDK1 through the activation of 14-3-3\u03c3 and DNA damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) [ 8 , 42 , 44 , 57 , 58 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 238, "text": "[ 56 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1379, "text": "[ 8 , 42 , 44 , 57 , 58 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Positive Regulators of Cell Cycle Progression"}, {"text": "Infl uenza A virus (IAV) is an important pathogenic virus that causes infl uenza in humans.

Infection with the H1N1 virus decreased the levels of hyperphosphorylated pRb, which is critical for progression of cells from late G1 to S phase. Additionally, HIN1 IAV-infected cells showed a signifi cant increase in levels of the CDK inhibitor, p21 and a decrease in levels of the G1/S cyclins, cyclin D and cyclin E. Interestingly, cells synchronized in the G0/G1 phase and subsequently infected with H1N1 IAV had increased viral protein accumulation and progeny virus production as compared to unsynchronized cells or those synchronized in the G2/M phase.

It is therefore possible that IAV arrests cells in the G0/G1 phase to increase the transcriptional activity of Pol II, which would consequently lead to enhanced viral transcription and replication [ 10 ] . Secondly, there is evidence that the translation of infl uenza viral proteins is linked to host cap-dependent translation activity [ 78 , 79 ] ; cap-dependent translation is optimal in the G0/G1 phase and is suppressed in mitosis [ 80 ] . Therefore, a G0-G1 arrest of IAV-infected cells would prevent progression into mitosis and could enhance cap-dependent translation of viral proteins and ultimately favor viral replication [ 10 ] . Thirdly, since cell cycle arrest can delay induction of apoptosis under certain conditions [ 81 , 82 ] , it is possible that IAV-mediated modulation of the G0/G1 phase prevents early death of infected cells, which would likely benefi t IAV genome replication [ 10 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 443, "text": "[ 76 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 570, "end": 576, "text": "[ 77 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 776, "end": 782, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 916, "end": 927, "text": "[ 78 , 79 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1021, "text": "[ 80 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1218, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1323, "text": "[ 81 , 82 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1486, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infl uenza A Virus Induces a G0/G1 Phase Cell Cycle Arrest"}, {"text": "In summary, the results of many studies suggest that infection with different strains of IAV can alter initiation of the host cell cycle to maintain cells in the G0/G1 phase; retention of IAVinfected cells in the G0/G1 phase is thought to provide optimal conditions for IAV replication.

The fi rst proposed possibility is that cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase may provide greater amounts of ribonucleotides for the synthesis of MHV RNA. Since ribonucleotides are precursors for synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, an inhibition of host cellular DNA synthesis could increase the availability of ribonucleotides in cells and promote effi cient MHV RNA synthesis [ 85 ] . A second proposed reason for why MHV causes cell cycle arrest is that this may prevent the induction and execution of early cell death in the MHV-infected cells [ 85 ] . MHV replication in cultured cells has been shown to lead to cell death; however, the onset of apoptosis occurs when the highest levels of MHV production are attained [ 92 -94 ] . It is not yet clear how MHV can attain maximal levels of viral replication prior to cell death. In certain systems, apoptosis has been shown to follow cell cycle arrest [ 81 , 82 ] , but in other systems cell cycle progression is required for the induction of apoptosis [ 95 ] . It is possible that MHV-dependent inhibition of the cell cycle slows the activation of apoptotic pathways in MHV-infected cells to allow for maximum viral replication prior to apoptosis of the infected cells. A third proposed reason for why MHV may cause cell cycle arrest is that this might facilitate effi cient MHV assembly [ 85 ] . Assembly of MHV occurs in the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus and requires proper intracellular membrane structures [ 96 , 97 ] . Since most membrane traffi cking steps are disrupted during the M phase [ 98 , 99 ] , MHV-mediated host cell cycle arrest may lead to effi cient MHV assembly [ 85 ] . A fourth proposed reason for why MHV causes cell cycle arrest is that this may be benefi cial for cap-dependent translation of MHV mRNAs [ 85 ] . Due to the impaired function of the cap-binding protein, cap-dependent translation is reduced during the M phase [ 100 ] . All the mRNAs of MHV are capped at the 5\u2032 end, and the translation of all MHV proteins, except the E protein, is cap-dependent [ 101 ] . Lastly, MHVinduced cell cycle arrest may have an important signifi cance for MHV-induced pathogenesis [ 85 ] .

HCV infections are a global health problem that affects approximately 170 million people worldwide [ 107 ] . HCV is hepatotropic and is one of the major causes of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans [ 108 ] . Currently, there is no effective vaccine against HCV infection, and the standard treatment, consisting of a combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and a nucleoside analogue, ribavirin, produces a sustained virological response in only 50 % of the patients infected with genotype 1 and 80 % of the patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3 [ 109 , 110 ] . The use of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin has various side effects such as hematological complications. There are many new therapies for HCV infection in clinical development including Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents (DAA) and Host-Targeting Antiviral Agents. Two DAAs, the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir, which are both reversible covalent inhibitors of the HCV NS3-NS4A serine protease, have been approved for HCV treatment. Additionally, other DAAs, which are in phase III studies, include an NS5A inhibitor, NS5B polymerase inhibitors, and noncovalent NS3-NS4A protease inhibitors. Additionally, certain host-targeting antiviral agents, including inhibitors of cyclophilin A and microRNA (miR)122, have advanced to phase 2 or 3 clinical trials. The approval of boceprevir and telaprevir has led to the use of a triple therapy for HCV genotype 1 infection. A triple therapy regimen usually consists of one of these two protease inhibitors in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Although the triple therapy regimens are usually more effective than a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin without a protease inhibitor, they are associated with various side effects, and the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin remains the recommended treatment for HCV genotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection [ 109 -111 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 333, "text": "[ 105 , 106 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 435, "end": 442, "text": "[ 107 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 596, "end": 603, "text": "[ 108 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 943, "end": 956, "text": "[ 109 , 110 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2313, "end": 2325, "text": "[ 109 -111 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viruses That Regulate the G1 and S Phases of the Cell Cycle"}, {"text": "HCV proteins have been shown to both promote and inhibit cell cycle progression, and it is likely that the effects of HCV on the cell cycle are infl uenced by the experimental system used to test HCV effects on these cellular processes. The results of several studies have suggested that one or more HCV proteins can modulate cell cycle regulatory genes to affect the G1/S checkpoint in HCVinfected cells (Table 1 ) [ 112 -127 ] . The HCV viral core protein, which forms the viral capsid, is thought to play a vital role in the development of HCV-associated HCC [ 11 ] . The results of a recent study demonstrated that the HCV core protein decreased p21 expression in human hepatoma cells. An HCV core-induced increase in the level of miR-345 was found to suppress endogenous p21 expression by targeting the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the p21 mRNA [ 117 ] . Decreases in the levels of p21 would lead to accelerated cell cycle progression, and increased p21 expression is frequently observed in human cancers [ 128 ] . Thus it is possible that the HCV core protein-induced decrease in p21 expression may contribute to HCV-induced HCC. These results are in agreement with previous studies that have shown a pro-proliferative effect of the core protein; HCV core induced S-phase progression in various cell systems and growth conditions [ 22 , 122 , 124 , 125 ] . For example, HCV core protein expression increased the fraction of HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma cell line, in the S phase by increasing the stability of the c-myc oncoprotein [ 122 ] . Additionally, the HCV core protein, expressed alone or in the context of HCV replication, promoted cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle progression in Huh-7 cells, a human hepatoma cell line [ 22 ] . In this system, HCV core activated the Wnt-\u03b2 catenin signaling pathway, which was shown to be a major mediator of HCV core-induced cell proliferation. Results from another study in HepG2 cells also showed that the HCV core protein stimulated cell growth by decreasing the levels of the CDK inhibitor, p16 via induction of hypermethylation of the p16 transcription promoter [ 113 ] . The HCV NS3, NS5A, and NS5B proteins have also been shown to promote cell growth [ 126 , 127 ] . The results of one study in NIH3T3 cells showed that NS3 mediated a p53-dependent transcriptional repression of p21 [ 129 ] . In murine fi broblasts and HepG2 cells, the NS5A protein repressed transcription of p21 and increased expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), which is expressed during the S phase and required for DNA replication [ 112 ] . pRb expression was also shown to be decreased in HCV-infected hepatoma cells; decreased levels of pRb were caused by NS5B-dependent ubiquitination of pRb and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of pRb. Loss of pRb function in HCV-infected cells could promote hepatocyte proliferation and contribute to the development of HCC [ 127 ] .

The induction of S-phase arrest in NS2-expressing cells was associated with decreased cyclin A expression [ 115 ] . The results of a different study also showed that the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B, delayed S-phase progression by interacting with the CDKinteracting protein (CINP) [ 118 ] . In fact, this study led to the identifi cation of CINP and provides an example of how analyzing viral regulation of the cell cycle may help identify novel cell cycle regulatory proteins. Similar to the NS2-and NS5B-mediated cell cycle arrest, and in contrast to studies outlined above, the results of additional studies have suggested that the HCV core protein can impair the G1 to S phase transition through various mechanisms, including induction of p21 expression and stabilization of the CDK inhibitor, p27 (Table 1 ) At early time points after induction of core protein expression, both the 21-kDa and 19-kDa forms were equally abundant in HCV coreexpressing cells; however, at later time points, the 19-kDa form accumulated and became the dominant species. The 21-kDa form of the core protein was associated with an increased expression of p21 and a concomitant decrease in CDK2 activity. These changes in p21 and CDK2 activity led to a decrease in cellular proliferation. However, accumulation of the 19-kDa form caused a decline in p21 levels. These results suggest that the HCV core proteindependent regulation of p21 expression might depend on the early presence of the immature form of the core protein or the later expression of the mature form of the core protein during an HCV infection and may provide an explanation for the confl icting observations in various studies that have analyzed the regulation of p21 by the HCV core protein. It is possible that some studies only analyzed the effect of the 19-kDa, mature form, of the core protein or that the processing kinetics of the HCV core protein may differ in the individual studies, leading to varying effects of the core protein on p21 expression [ 130 ] . Biphasic effects on cell cycle regulatory molecules have also been demonstrated for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the Herpesvirus family; cyclin A expression was repressed early after HCMV infection but induced at later stages of the viral infection [ 134 ] .

The impact of expressing the entire HCV genome on the cell cycle has also been analyzed (Table 1 ) ; however, because of the lack of an effi cient HCV infection system, the effects of an HCV infection on the host cell cycle remain unclear. To begin to clarify these effects, in one study a Cre recombinase/loxP conditional system for the expression of the full-length HCV genome was generated in HepG2 cells, thus enabling the creation of a system that at least partially mimicked persistently HCV-infected hepatocytes. The results of this study showed that cells expressing the full-length HCV RNA activated the CDK-pRb-E2F pathway more effectively than observed when individual HCV proteins were expressed [ 114 ] . Full genome HCV RNA expression also enhanced anchorage-independent growth of HepG2 cells, whereas HepG2 cells only expressing HCV structural, nonstructural, or even all viral proteins showed no signifi cant changes in anchorage-independent growth; this observation might suggest that the viral RNA itself somehow affects the cell cycle [ 114 ] . The tumor suppressor, pRb, is frequently inactivated in HCC, and HCV-mediated regulation of the CDK-pRb-E2F pathway may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the high incidence of HCC in HCV-infected patients [ 114 , 135 ] . Finally, the results of a different study indicated that an HCV infection is associated with a delay in cell cycle progression. HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells, a subline of Huh-7 hepatoma cells that can support HCV replication, showed signifi cantly fewer cells in the S phase as compared to mock-infected cells. Further, results from gene expression analysis suggested that HCV-mediated apoptosis of Huh-7.5 cells might be a result of perturbations in cell cycle progression [ 119 ] . Interestingly, a G1 arrest was also observed in patient hepatocytes during a chronic HCV infection [ 121 , 136 , 137 ].

Therefore, the signifi cance of HCV-induced cell cycle arrest or proliferation for HCV replication and HCVassociated disease remains unclear. In addition, the paucity of authentic HCV replication systems, and the consequential study of HCV replication in systems that may not accurately refl ect all aspects of an authentic HCV infection, has sometimes generated seemingly discrepant observations of HCV effects on the cell cycle. Although direct confi rmation is lacking, various possible effects of cell cycle regulation on HCV replication have been proposed. For example, the biphasic effect of the HCV core protein on the cell cycle may be important for HCV replication, and it is possible that HCV-mediated cell cycle arrest protects cells from apoptosis during the initial stages of an HCV infection. Alternatively, during early stages of HCV infection, the immature form of the HCV core protein may regulate the expression of proteins that are required for repressing the immune response and thus help infected cells evade immune defenses [ 130 ] . Some studies have linked the effect of the cell cycle status on the translational activity of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which mediates capindependent translation of the HCV RNA and is located at the 5\u2032 end of the HCV genome. The HCV IRES-dependent translation effi ciency in Huh-7 cells was highest during the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle but was decreased during the S phase and dramatically reduced during the G2/M phase. Therefore, it is possible that HCV proteins modulate cell cycle regulatory proteins to induce a cell cycle arrest to allow effi cient HCV translation and replication [ 138 ] . It has also been proposed that HCV-mediated cell cycle arrest limits the regenerative response of the liver to ongoing injury and contributes to the progression of liver disease [ 121 , 136 , 137 ]. In contrast, some studies have demonstrated a positive impact of cell proliferation on HCV replication. The results of one study showed that the translational activity of the HCV IRES was greatest in cells that are actively dividing [ 139 ] . In accordance with this, fi ndings from another study suggested that HCV replication is highly dependent on cellular proliferation, and HCV RNA synthesis was strongly enhanced in the S phase. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous studies, the same study also showed that HCV protein expression and genome replication did not affect the cell cycle status of Huh-7 cells [ 120 ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1328, "end": 1335, "text": "[ 130 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1960, "text": "[ 138 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2402, "text": "[ 139 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis C Virus Modulates the G1/S Checkpoint"}, {"text": "In summary, numerous studies have analyzed the effect of HCV infection on the cell cycle status of hepatocytes. However, most of these studies were conducted with overexpression of a single HCV protein, and the results of these studies have sometimes identifi ed contradictory effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins. Studies involving a single HCV protein may not accurately represent the expression levels of that HCV protein in HCVinfected livers and cannot analyze the consequence of interactions between different HCV proteins that could infl uence the cell cycle during an HCV infection. Moreover, most HCV studies that analyzed the impact of HCV proteins on the cell cycle were conducted in immortalized or transformed cell lines. Although challenging, future studies in primary hepatocytes may help delineate the exact effects of HCV on the cell cycle during an authentic HCV infection [ 140 ] . These types of studies should also consider that HCV has several genotypes and that different disease outcomes have been reported in patients infected with different HCV genotypes [ 141 ]. Therefore, it is possible that different genotypes of HCV will have different effects on the cell cycle, which might account for some of the contradictory observations that have been reported. Recently, a genetically humanized mouse model that expresses human CD81 and human occludin and can be infected with HCV was generated. This is the fi rst mouse model where the entire HCV life cycle can be studied and provides new opportunities to understand the in vivo consequences of an HCV infection for hepatocyte genome replication and the cell cycle [ 142 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 896, "end": 903, "text": "[ 140 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1651, "text": "[ 142 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis C Virus Modulates the G1/S Checkpoint"}, {"text": "The small DNA tumor viruses are a group of double-stranded DNA viruses; representative examples of these viruses are papillomaviruses such as the HPV, Adenoviruses (Ad), and polyomaviruses such as the Simian virus 40 (SV40) [ 2 , 143 ] . HPV infections are associated with the development of cervical, anal, and neck cancers [ 144 ] . Although SV40 and adenoviruses have not been linked to human cancers, they can immortalize and transform cells in culture [ 145 ] . The small DNA tumor viruses are dependent on the host cell DNA replication machinery for the replication of the viral genomes. These viruses typically infect differentiated, quiescent cells, which may not be an ideal environment for viral replication because the host cell DNA replication machinery is only available during the S phase [ 146 , 147 ] . The small DNA tumor viruses do not encode a DNA polymerase or other enzymes that are involved in DNA synthesis [ 4 ] . Moreover, since quiescent cells have low levels of deoxynucleotides, the environment of quiescent cells may not be conducive to viral DNA synthesis. Thus, it is thought that small DNA viruses must induce S-phase entry of infected cells in order to create an environment that is favorable for viral replication. HPV, Ad, and SV40 have evolved strategies to promote unscheduled entry of infected cells into the S phase [ 6 , 146 , 147 ] (Fig. 3 ) . Entry into S phase allows these viruses to use host enzymatic activities and cellular DNA precursors for their own DNA replication. Consequently, these viruses encode proteins that can affect cell cycle control mechanisms. For example, the small DNA tumor viruses encode proteins that can inhibit p53 and the Rb family members [ 6 , 18 , 19 , 148 -150 ] (Fig. 3 ) . Inhibition of p53 and Rb family members by these virally encoded proteins induces the cells to enter S phase. Inhibition of p53 and Rb by the small DNA tumor virus proteins is also required for the cell transformation that is associated with HPV, Ad, or SV40 infections [ 6 , 18 , 145 , 150 , 151 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 235, "text": "[ 2 , 143 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 325, "end": 332, "text": "[ 144 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 457, "end": 464, "text": "[ 145 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 803, "end": 816, "text": "[ 146 , 147 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 930, "end": 935, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1372, "text": "[ 6 , 146 , 147 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1738, "text": "[ 6 , 18 , 19 , 148 -150 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2049, "text": "[ 6 , 18 , 145 , 150 , 151 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1373, "end": 1382, "text": "(Fig. 3 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1748, "text": "(Fig. 3 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Hepatitis C Virus Modulates the G1/S Checkpoint"}, {"text": "Transforming oncoproteins of the small DNA tumor viruses include E1A from adenovirus, E7 from HPV, and large T antigen (LTag) from SV40 [ 145 ] ; these oncoproteins bind to and inactivate Rb family members, thus abrogating the need for phosphorylation by the G1 CDKs, CDK4 and CDK6 [ 3 ] (Fig. 3 ) .

The binding of E1A, E7, or the LTag to the pocket region of Rb leads to the displacement of its cellular binding partners, HDAC and E2F. The steric disruption of the E2F-Rb complexes allows the release of the S-phase transcription factor, E2F [ 6 , 7 , 146 , 153 -164 ] . In addition to disrupting the interaction of Rb with E2F, E1A and LTag can inhibit pocket protein function by inducing posttranslational modifi cations [ 146 ] . The results of various studies indicate that the binding of E7 to all three Rb proteins induces their degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [ 7 , 146 , 165 , 166 ] . Overall, the transforming oncoproteins of the small DNA tumor viruses can inactivate Rb family members and cause unscheduled progression into the S phase. Inactivation of the Rb family by E1A, E7, and LTag would lead to the induction of transcription of E2F responsive genes, which include the E2Fcontrolled cell cycle and DNA synthesis genes, and help establish a favorable environment for viral replication [ 6 , 146 ] . The p53 tumor suppressor pathway can be activated as a response to various cellular stresses, including DNA damage. The activation of p53 either leads to the induction of cell cycle arrest to allow time for the cell to repair any DNA damage or initiates apoptosis if the DNA damage is too extensive or cannot be repaired. Infection with many different viruses has been linked to activation of p53; extensive viral DNA replication can trigger a DNA damage response that activates p53. Since the induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis could prevent new virus production, many viruses, including the small DNA tumor viruses, have evolved mechanisms to inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor pathway [ 167 ] . The SV40 LTag, Ad E1B, and HPV E6 oncoproteins have been shown to bind to p53 [ 6 , 167 ] (Fig. 3 ) . LTag can directly bind and inactivate p53 [ 168 -170 ] . In fact, p53 was fi rst identifi ed as an interaction partner of the LTag and then later shown to have an important tumor suppressor activity [ 171 , 172 ] . E1B and E6 can facilitate the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 via recruitment of other cellular factors that regulate this process. E1B, in conjunction with the adenovirus protein E4-ORF6, assembles into an ubiquitin ligase complex together with cellular proteins involved in ubiquitination (Cullin 5 and Elongins B/C), to target p53 for degradation [ 173 , 174 ] . E6 stimulates the degradation of p53 by recruiting the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP-100K [ 175 ] .

When latently infected cells are treated with agents that induce the lytic phase of EBV replication, the EBV-infected cells stop dividing and arrest at the G0/G1 phase [ 4 , 216 -218 ] . The EBV immediateearly transactivator, Zta, also referred to as the lytic switch transactivator, can induce a G0/G1 arrest [ 218 ] . Zta acts at multiple distinct control points in the cell cycle regulatory machinery to mediate cell cycle arrest, including Zta induction of the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27. Expression of Zta has been shown to induce arrest in the G0 and G1 phases; however, it also induces the expression of certain S-phase genes [ 4 , 7 , 18 , 217 , 218 ] . Additionally, another EBV-encoded lytic transactivator, Rta, is thought to have a cell cycle activation function (Fig. 3 ) . Rta can induce the expression of E2F, which would favor cell cycle progression [ 219 ] . Thus, despite the ability of EBV to cause cell cycle arrest during a lytic infection, it has also been shown to stimulate certain cell cycle activation pathways [ 7 ] . During a lytic infection, EBV inactivates pRb and expresses many EBV-encoded nucleotide biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 3 ) . Therefore, both cellular and viral nucleotide biosynthetic enzymes are present during an EBV lytic infection.

Some studies have shown that HCMV infection can stimulate cellular DNA synthesis; however, most of these studies were conducted in cell lines that were not permissive to HCMV replication [ 222 -224 ] .

Interestingly, although pRb is hypophosphorylated in HSV-1 infected cells, the activity of CDKs that are responsible for the phosphorylation of pRb seems to be essential for HSV-1 replication, and the activity of CDKs is required for the expression of HSV-1 genes [ 245 , 246 ] . Although not completely clear, it is thought that CDKs stimulate HSV-1 replication by modulating RNA Polymerase II function [ 247 ] . Further, it is possible that CDKs may enhance the ability of ICP0 to activate transcription [ 248 ] . Surprisingly, although CDK activity seems to be required for expression of HSV-1 genes, the results of two studies demonstrated that HSV-1 infection suppresses cyclin-CDK function [ 239 , 241 ] . One group showed that HSV-1 infection prevents the induction of cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 following the addition of serum to serum-starved cells [ 239 ] . Additionally, results from another group showed that the infection of quiescent cells suppressed serum-induced cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 activity and also led to a loss of cyclin E levels [ 241 ] . However, in contrast to these studies, results of a different study showed that HSV-1 infection of serum-starved cells resulted in no change in CDK4 activity, an induction of cyclin A expression, and a transient induction of CDK2 activity [ 249 ] . These seemingly discrepant observations could be explained by a difference in the experimental systems used in these studies. The fi rst two groups infected quiescent cells in the presence of newly replaced serum, whereas the later group infected quiescent cells in the presence of spent, not freshly replaced, medium. Thus, while the fi rst two studies addressed the ability of HSV-1 to prevent serum-stimulated induction of cyclin-CDK function, the latter group determined whether HSV-1 infection could activate cyclin-CDK function above the uninduced, background levels [ 4 ] . Overall, the results of these various studies suggest that HSV-1 infection may partly suppress the serum-stimulated induction of cyclin-CDK activity but probably not the basal uninduced levels.

HBx can also affect the negative cell cycle regulators, p16, p21, and p27 [ 257 ] . Results from a study in HBV-associated HCC liver sections demonstrated that the liver sections that contained high levels of methylated p16 promoters also had high expression levels of HBx. These results indicate that the expression of HBx correlates with the methylation status of the p16 promoter [ 278 ] . Similarly, HBx induced hypermethylation of the p16 promoter and downregulation of p16 protein levels in HepG2 cells [ 276 ] . Studies were also conducted in liver tissue samples from HBV-associated HCCs and corresponding HBV-infected noncancerous liver sections. HBx expression in HBV-infected noncancerous tissues correlated positively with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and negatively with p16 protein expression. However, in the HBV-associated HCC tissues, HBx expression still correlated positively with DNMT1 but did not correlate with the hypermethylation of the p16 promoter or with p16 protein expression. Thus, the results of this study suggest that HBx-mediated hypermethylation of p16 may play a role in the early stages of HBV-related HCC [ 279 ] . HBx has been shown to lead to both upregulation and downregulation of the Cip/Kip family members; the precise impact of HBx expression on the members of the Cip/Kip family seems to vary in different cellular contexts [ 257 ] . HBx increased p21 levels in NIH3T3 cells, a mouse embryonic fi broblast cell line, when p53 was present but did not increase the level of p21 when p53 was knocked down [ 280 ] . However, in a different study, HBx was found to increase p21 levels in Hep3B cells, a p53 mutant HCC cell line [ 281 ] . In Huh7 cells, HBx expression increased proteasomal degradation of p27 [ 270 ] . Interestingly, the results of a study in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the level of HBx expression infl uenced its effects on p21 and p27. Low levels of HBx expression resulted in an increased activity of the p21 and p27 promoters. On the contrary, when HBx was expressed at high levels, there was an inhibition of the activity of the p21 and p27 promoters [ 282 ] . This study suggests that the observed effects of HBx on CKIs can be infl uenced by the experimental conditions. Most of the studies described above were conducted in immortalized or transformed cell lines and when HBx was overexpressed in the absence of other HBV proteins, which could contribute to the varying HBx effects that were observed. Since cellular signaling pathways that control normal cell cycle progression are usually altered in established cell lines, the effects of HBx in these cells could refl ect functions that are valid in a specifi c cellular context but are not present in normal hepatocytes, which are the site of an authentic HBV infection. Recent studies in cultured primary hepatocytes have analyzed the effect of HBx expression, both when HBx is expressed alone and in the context of HBV replication, on hepatocyte cell cycle regulatory pathways (Fig. 4 ). HBx decreased the expression level of both p15 and p16 in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. Additionally, HBx increased the expression of p21 and p27. Thus, HBx expression decreased the levels of the CDK inhibitors that maintain the quiescent status of hepatocytes but increased the levels of the CDK inhibitors that prevent cell cycle progression past the late G1 phase [ 104 ] . Similar results were apparent in primary mouse hepatocytes; HBx increased the expression of both p21 and p27 and decreased cellular DNA synthesis [ 283 ] . An increase in cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression was also observed in HBx-expressing cultured primary rat hepatocytes. However, HBx expression did not induce a change in the levels of S-phase activating proteins, including cyclin A and PCNA, indicating that HBx expression in normal hepatocytes does not induce entry into the S phase [ 104 ] . Importantly, similar effects were observed in primary rat hepatocytes when HBx was expressed in the context of the HBV genome and in the presence of other HBV proteins [ 104 ] . Further, these effects of HBx were also confi rmed in cultured primary human hepatocytes [ 284 ] . Although HBx upregulated CDK4 activity in primary rat hepatocytes, the increase in cyclin E expression levels was not associated with an increase in CDK2 activity [ 104 ] . Overall, the results of these studies suggest that HBx induces quiescent hepatocytes to exit G0 but stall in the G1 phase.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 95, "text": "[ 257 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 338, "end": 369, "text": "[ 264 , 266 , 270 , 276 , 277 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 446, "end": 453, "text": "[ 257 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 755, "end": 762, "text": "[ 278 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 881, "end": 888, "text": "[ 276 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1525, "text": "[ 279 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF258"}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1752, "text": "[ 257 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1930, "text": "[ 280 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2051, "text": "[ 281 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2132, "text": "[ 270 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF250"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2509, "text": "[ 282 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 3769, "end": 3776, "text": "[ 104 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 3925, "end": 3932, "text": "[ 283 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 4269, "end": 4276, "text": "[ 104 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 4447, "end": 4454, "text": "[ 104 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 4546, "end": 4553, "text": "[ 284 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 4719, "end": 4726, "text": "[ 104 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3387, "end": 3394, "text": "(Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "HBx Regulation of the Cell Cycle"}, {"text": "HBx-mediated exit of hepatocytes from G0 but subsequent HBx-induced arrest of hepatocytes at the G1/S phase border was shown to be critical for HBV replication in cultured primary rat hepatocytes [ 104 ] . The entry of quiescent hepatocytes into the G1 phase was necessary for the activation of the HBV polymerase [ 285 ] . The inhibition of S-phase progression was proposed to be important for HBV replication because the stalling of the cell cycle at the G1/S border might prevent competition between the host cell DNA replication machinery and the HBV replication machinery for available deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). Since the levels of dNTPs in quiescent cells are low [ 286 ] , it is possible that HBx modulation of the cell cycle may lead to an increase in the levels of cellular dNTPs that are available to the HBV polymerase. Interestingly, HBx upregulated the expression of active ribonucleotide reductase in cultured primary rat hepatocytes [ 285 ] . Cumulatively, these observations in primary hepatocytes suggest that HBx modulation of cell proliferation is essential for HBV replication. Alterations in cell cycle proteins and their regulatory mechanisms have been linked to cancer development [ 287 ] , and HBx-induced changes in normal proliferation pathways of quiescent hepatocytes may facilitate HBV replication while ultimately proving detrimental to normal hepatocyte physiology and contributing to processes that infl uence the development of HBV-associated liver transformation [ 285 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 203, "text": "[ 104 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 314, "end": 321, "text": "[ 285 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 683, "end": 690, "text": "[ 286 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 961, "end": 968, "text": "[ 285 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1224, "text": "[ 287 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1517, "text": "[ 285 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sumedha Bagga and Michael J.

However, because of differences in mouse strains and experimental protocols and because hepatocyte proliferation was analyzed at different times after a partial hepatectomy (PH), it is diffi cult to compare the results from the different groups [ 11 ] . Two of the studies suggested that HBx expression inhibits liver regeneration [ 288 , 289 ] , whereas the results of another study suggested that HBx did not affect total hepatocyte division but caused a subpopulation of HBx-expressing hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle prematurely [ 290 ] . These studies used mouse models in which HBx expression was controlled by the human antithrombin III gene promoter [ 288 ] , the mouse albumin gene promoter [ 289 ] , or the human \u03b11-antitrypsin regulatory region [ 290 ] . Although these promoters function in hepatocytes, because the endogenous HBV HBx transcription promoter was not used to drive HBx expression, variations in the level of HBx expression that may not completely mimic normal levels of HBx and may vary between these different promoters could have infl uenced the HBx-mediated effect on hepatocyte proliferation. Recently, a novel HBx transgenic mouse model was generated; in these mice, HBx expression was under the control of endogenous HBx viral regulatory elements. In these mice, HBx caused delayed cell cycle progression and liver regeneration that was linked to HBx-induced IL-6 overexpression [ 291 ] . Thus, the results of this study were consistent with the previously described antiproliferative effects of HBx expression on liver regeneration. Although this system could be argued to more accurately refl ect endogenous HBx levels during an HBV infection, unfortunately mRNA splice sites, which are not present in the HBV genome, and a foreign, non-HBx mRNA 3\u2032 noncoding region were included, which likely affected HBx expression levels. Therefore, this system also does not completely mimic HBx expression during an authentic HBV infection. Cumulatively, the studies in HBx transgenic mice have demonstrated that HBx can regulate hepatocyte proliferation pathways; however, the exact impact seems to vary in different mouse models. Determining the impact of HBx expression on liver regeneration will likely provide a more accurate understanding of the effects of HBx on hepatocyte proliferation pathways in vivo. The impact of HBx on liver regeneration could be an important HBx activity that infl uences the development of HBV-associated HCC.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 367, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 447, "end": 460, "text": "[ 288 , 289 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 653, "end": 660, "text": "[ 290 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 778, "end": 785, "text": "[ 288 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 820, "end": 827, "text": "[ 289 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 876, "end": 883, "text": "[ 290 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1539, "text": "[ 291 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sumedha Bagga and Michael J.

Results of one study showed that HeLa cells infected with HTLV-1 or transduced with Tax arrested in the G1 phase; HTLV-1 infected cells, similar to the cells transduced with Tax, expressed high levels of p21 and p27 [ 310 ] . On the contrary, HOS (human osteosarcoma lineage) cells continued to proliferate after HTLV-1 infection or Tax expression; however, these cells demonstrated a reduced growth rate and exhibited mitotic aberrations. Constitutive activation of the P13K/ Akt pathway in HOS cells leads to a reduction in the expression of p21 and p27, which allows HTLV-1 and Tax-induced G1 arrest to be reverted. Similar to Tax effects in HeLa cells, HTLV-1 infection or Tax expression also caused human SupT1 T cells to arrest in the G1 phase [ 310 ] . The results of this study suggest that an HTLV-1 infection usually leads to a Tax-mediated G1 arrest. Alternatively, T cells containing somatic mutations that inactivate the CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27, may proliferate after an HTLV-1 infection [ 310 ] . It is thought that in the context of an HTLV-1 infection, Tax promotes cell proliferation; oligoclonal expansion of infected T cells can lead to the onset of ATL. However, this cannot completely explain the long clinical latency of ATL following an HTLV-1 infection. The results of this study suggest that the oncogenic potentials of Tax could be revealed only when HTLV-1 infects or reactivates from T cells whose p21 and p27 function and/or expression has been lost [ 310 ] . The HTLV-1 accessory protein, p30, has also been shown to interact with cyclin E, reduce the function of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, and delay the cell cycle before entry into S phase (Fig. 4 ) [ 311 ] . p30 also binds to the mRNA encoding the Tax/Rex proteins to prevent its nuclear export. Since Tax and Rex are positive regulators of viral gene expression, their inhibition by p30 leads to a decrease in virus expression [ 313 ] . This is thought to be benefi cial for the establishment of a latent and persistent infection [ 311 ] . Since HTLV-1 is a highly immunogenic virus and has low genetic variability, a controlled and reduced expression of the viral proteins could be essential for viral maintenance in the course of a natural infection. The different effects of Tax and p30 on cell cycle regulation may be refl ected in their different effects on HTLV-1 replication; Tax is a positive regulator of HTLV-1 replication, whereas p30 is a negative regulator [ 311 , 314 ] . It is possible that rapid proliferation of cells is required at certain stages of HTLV-1 replication; however, uncontrolled proliferation of infected cells may lead to expression of viral proteins [ 311 ] . Therefore, HTLV-1 seems to have also evolved strategies that prevent rapid division of the infected cells [ 311 ] . Finally, the results of additional studies suggest that HTLV-1-encoded small proteins, such as p30 and p12, help the infected cells to evade immune defenses and prevent elimination of infected cells by host immune cells [ 311 , 315 -321 ] . Overall, a number of studies have analyzed the effects of various HTLV-1 proteins, particularly Tax, on the host cell cycle.

Serotype 3 reoviruses-induced G2/M arrest was shown to require the viral S1 gene-encoded \u03c21s nonstructural protein. Serotype 3 reovirus infection caused a signifi cant reduction in CDK1 activity and was associated with an increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1. The \u03c21s protein was required for the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 [ 326 ] . The Human Herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) can also induce a G2/M arrest. HHV-6A infected cells had a decrease in the activity of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex [ 328 ] . The inactivation of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex was associated with an increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1, which was a result of elevated Wee1 expression and inactivation of Cdc25C. Moreover, HHV-6A infected cells had increased expression of p21; this elevated p21 expression was p53-dependent [ 328 ] . p21 can bind to the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, inhibit its activity, and prevent G2/M transition. Finally, HHV-6 infection activated the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1. Thus, HHV-6A infection induces a G2/M arrest by reducing cyclin B1-CDK1 activity through various regulatory mechanisms [ 328 ] . SV40 and EBV have also been reported to induce a G2/M arrest [ 329 ] . SV40 infection prevents activation of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, and this has been linked to maintenance of CDK1 phosphorylation [ 329 ] . A recent study showed that the EBV LMP-1 induces a G2/M-phase arrest; 14-3-3 sigma and Reprimo were found to be upregulated in LMP-1 expressing cells [ 330 ] . 14-3-3 sigma and Reprimo are p53-regulated inhibitors of G2/M progression [ 331 , 332 ] . Expression of 14-3-3 sigma can result in an inhibition of the activity of various CDKs, including CDK1 [ 333 ] . Further, p53 expression results in increased mRNA levels of Reprimo and leads to the induction of a G2/M arrest. In arrested cells, Reprimo can inhibit the activity of CDK1 [ 331 ] .

Instead, E1^E4 sequesters the cyclin B1-CDK1 complexes on the cytokeratin network, which prevents the accumulation of active cyclin B1-CDK1 complexes in the nucleus and thus inhibits entry into mitosis [ 334 ] .

The CAV protein Apoptotin associates with subunit 1 of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC10) and induces a G2/M arrest by inhibiting the function of APC10. Expression of Apoptotin caused disruption of the APC10 complex and stabilization of APC substrates [ 337 ] . The adenovirus E4orf4 can also elicit a cell cycle block at the G2/M phase. E4orf4 alters the activity of APC to either activate or inhibit the APC; E4orf4 regulates APC in a PP2A-dependent manner [ 54 , 55 ] . The detailed mechanisms that underlie E4orf regulation of APC are unknown, and it has not yet been shown whether this regulation occurs during adenovirus infection [ 336 ] . The HPV E2 proteins from highrisk but not low-risk HPV strains induce a G2/M block, which is independent of E6 and E7. E2-expressing cells that escaped the mitotic block displayed genomic instability. E2 proteins from highrisk HPV strains can also bind directly to Cdh1 and Cdc20, which are APC activators, delocalize Cdh1 to insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates, and cause the accumulation of APC substrates like cyclin B. These results suggest that the high-risk HPV E2 proteins may contribute to the oncogenic potential of HPV by inducing genomic instability [ 338 ] . The HCMV viral protein kinase pUL97 also induces Cdh1 phosphorylation during HCMV infection, which prevents the binding of Cdh1 to APC [ 339 ] . Further, during HCMV infection, HCMV pUL21A interacts with APC and targets APC4 and APC5, which are two bridge subunits of APC, for proteasomal degradation and thus leads to disruption of APC [ 340 ] . Taken together, these studies suggest that HCMV uses several mechanisms to ensure that the APC is inactivated [ 16 , 336 ] . HSV-1 uses a different strategy to prevent mitotic exit. HSV-1 ICP0 induces the degradation of the kinetochore proteins, centromeric protein A (CENP-A) and CENP-C, and therefore, causes kinetochore structural defects and mitotic delay [ 341 , 342 ] . Finally, the baculovirus EC27 protein is thought to act as a nondegradable cyclin B1-CDK1 analogue; however, the inhibition of mitotic exit by EC27 is not well understood [ 343 , 344 ] .

However, studies in human cells showed that Vpr does not induce a G2 arrest through the DNA damage checkpoint pathway [ 348 , 351 ] .

Overall, the results of these studies suggest that the Vpr-induced G2 arrest may be similar to the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint rather than the DNA damage checkpoint control [ 348 , 351 ] . The results of additional studies have shown that Vpr can also induce genomic instability, formation of micronuclei, and aneuploidy, which could be sensed as replication stresses that would lead to the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint [ 351 ] . Interestingly, the results of a recent study have led to the proposal of a novel mechanism underlying Vpr-induction of a G2/M arrest; the results of this study showed that the Vpr-induced G2 arrest occurs through an S-phase dependent mechanism. Although Vpr is well known to induce a G2/M arrest, the initiating event occurred in the S phase. Vpr-induced Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation occurred in the S phase, and Vpr-expressing cells completed the S phase but arrested at the G2/M boundary. The results of this study also showed that the DNA licensing factor Cdt1 was responsible for Vpr-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345 and for the G2 arrest induced by Vpr. This suggests that the Vpr-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and G2/M-phase arrest may be triggered during the onset of DNA replication [ 365 ] . Finally, PP2A is also involved in the Vpr-mediated G2 arrest; okadaic acid, which is a specifi c inhibitor of PP2A, blocks the Vprinduced G2/M arrest in both fi ssion yeast and human cells [ 352 , 368 ] . PP2A is a regulator of Cdc25C and G2/M checkpoint activation. Other viruses, including adenoviruses and HTLV-1, can also modulate the activity of PP2A [ 54 , 369 ] . Both adenovirus E4orf4 and HTLV-1 Tax can induce a G2/M arrest [ 54 , 370 -372 ] , and modulation of PP2A may be one of the strategies used by many viruses to induce a G2 arrest.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 130, "text": "[ 364 -367 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 323, "end": 336, "text": "[ 348 , 351 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 586, "end": 593, "text": "[ 351 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF333"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1402, "text": "[ 365 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF347"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1607, "text": "[ 352 , 368 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1773, "text": "[ 54 , 369 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1839, "end": 1856, "text": "[ 54 , 370 -372 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Human Immunodefi ciency Virus Type 1 Viral Protein R Induces a G2/M Arrest"}, {"text": "The results of studies with Vpr provide important examples of how viral proteins can manipulate cellular pathways at various points in order to promote effi cient viral replication.

Further, a Vpr-induced G2/M arrest is thought to provide an optimal cellular environment to achieve maximum levels of HIV-1 replication. The expression of HIV RNA is optimal in the G2 phase, and the ability of Vpr to manipulate the cell cycle and keep the cells in the G2 phase leads to an indirect increase in HIV LTR expression. Finally, Vpr expression leads to increased HIV-1 production, which correlated with increased LTR promoter activity in the G2 phase of HIV-1 infected cells.

In this pseudo-S phase, although cellular DNA replication is complete, the cellular environment is such that the substrates and the machinery for DNA replication are available. This extends the amount of time available to DNA viruses for replication of their genomes. For some DNA viruses, this continuous replicative state can lead to an increase in viral genome copy number [ 8 ] . The levels of some viral proteins also increase in the G2/M phase [ 8 ] . For example, the results of one study demonstrated that infection with the Coronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), caused an accumulation of infected cells in the G2/M phase. Interestingly, when the effects of the cell cycle perturbations on viral replication were examined, the IBV-infected, synchronized G2/M cells showed increased viral protein expression as compared to cells in the G0 phase or the asynchronously replicating cells [ 9 ] . Some RNA viruses, such as HIV, are more transcriptionally active in G2 [ 349 ] , and an increased level of transcription during G2/M may lead to production of more viral genomes [ 8 ] . Additionally, some viruses can utilize the different phases of the cell cycle to modulate protein expression via utilization of IRES-mediated translation; the IRES of HIV is upregulated in G2/M while that of HCV appears to be downregulated [ 8 , 374 , 375 ] . Apart from the effects on transcription and translation of viral proteins, a G2/M arrest may also impact virion assembly and release [ 8 ] . It has been proposed that the enveloped RNA viruses arrest the cell cycle prior to mitosis so as to maintain an intact intracellular organization [ 1 ] . This is benefi cial to the viruses whose assembly occurs in the Golgi apparatus and ER [ 376 ] . For example, coronaviruses, such as IBV, utilize golgi and ER structures for their protein processing and assembly [ 377 -380 ] . Finally, it is important to note that virusinduced G2/M arrest has been mostly studied in immortalized or transformed cell lines. Since cellular signaling pathways that regulate the cell cycle are usually altered in immortalized or transformed cell lines, the actual effect of the viral protein might be confounded in these systems [ 8 ] . Additionally, for many viruses, the consequence of a G2/M arrest for viral replication remains incompletely understood and requires further investigation, especially in systems that more accurately mimic sites of an authentic infection. Although all the studies described above focus on how viruses can initiate a G2 arrest, some viral proteins can also abrogate the G2/M checkpoint; examples of these viral proteins include HTLV1-Tax and EBV-EBNA3C.

HBx has been shown to activate APC through its interaction with BubR1, which is a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC).

It is possible that APC may limit viral replication by degrading these viral proteins, and inhibition of APC could enhance the stability of these viral proteins [ 336 ] . Future studies should focus on determining the impact of viral proteins on APC in the context of infection.

Particularly, the studies of small DNA tumor viruses have been extremely valuable in understanding the role of p53 and pRb in cell cycle control. For many viruses, such as the small DNA viruses and some Herpesviruses, the effects of infections with the viruses on the cell cycle are well understood. However, there are still many unanswered questions in regard to the exact outcomes of viralinduced cell cycle progression and arrest during infections with viruses such as HBV, HCV, HIV, and HTLV-1. Many studies that have analyzed the effects of these viruses on the host cell cycle have, by necessity, been conducted in immortalized or transformed cells. Since signaling pathways that control normal cell cycle progression are usually altered in immortalized or transformed cell lines, the effects of the viral protein, although valid in that specifi c cellular context, may not necessarily be similar during the course of a natural infection in normal cells. Effects of the viral proteins may be infl uenced by factors that are present in the transformed or immortalized cells as compared to normal cells as well as structural alteration, as described below, that might regulate these viral proteins in specifi c cellular systems. Future studies should focus on understanding the effects of viral proteins on the host cell cycle in systems that closely resemble a natural infection [ 8 ] . Moreover, many studies that have analyzed the effect of a particular viral protein on the host cell cycle were conducted in systems in which individual viral proteins were overexpressed, and often out of the context of the entire viral genome. These types of systems may not accurately refl ect the expression level of the viral protein during an actual infection. Therefore, it will be important in future studies to analyze the effects of viral proteins on the cell cycle when these proteins are expressed in the context of viral replication, and in the presence of other viral proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1565, "end": 1570, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Perspectives"}, {"text": "As described in this chapter, the multifunctionality of many viral proteins, such as those encoded by HBV, HCV, HIV, and HTLV-I, can often lead to context-dependent activities and an array of seemingly contradictory effects on cellular signaling pathways. Many viral proteins seem to have adopted a multifaceted approach to manipulate the host cell cycle. Because viruses have limits to their genome size and must encode many functions in a limited number of proteins, it is not surprising that many viral proteins are multifunctional. To this end, many viruses encode regulatory proteins that can each modulate multiple cellular factors, including those that regulate the cell cycle, to promote viral replication. Very recently, the results of two studies have provided insights into the multifunctionality of viral proteins. The results of one study showed that the viral matrix protein 40 (VP40) of the Ebola virus can rearrange into different structural assemblies. The highly plastic, unmodifi ed, wild-type VP40 polypeptide assembled into distinct structures including a dimeric precursor, a hexameric structural component, and a nonstructural RNA-binding ring structure. Each of these distinct structures was shown to have unique and critical functions in the Ebola virus life cycle; the butterfl y-shaped VP40 dimer was essential for cellular traffi cking, the hexameric structural component was essential for matrix assembly, and viral budding and the RNA-binding structure had a critical role in regulating viral transcription [ 388 ] . Ebola virus encodes just 7 genes, and the ability of its protein, VP40, to adopt a different shape for a different function provides one possible explanation for how the virus can accomplish a multiple-step life cycle even though it encodes a small number of genes. The physical plasticity possessed by VP40 that enables it to arrange into distinct structures demonstrates how a structural rearrangement can allow the product of a single viral gene to accomplish a number of essential functions [ 388 ] . A second study analyzed the multifunctionality of the Adenovirus E1A protein. Multiple cellular proteins can interact with the E1A protein, and this was linked to dynamic changes in the intrinsically disordered portions of E1A that expand the repertoire of cellular proteins that can bind to E1A [ 389 ] . Many viruses have a small genome, and encoding proteins that form distinct structures that function at different stages of the virus life cycle would help these viruses to accomplish a large number of diverse functions with a small number of genes. Thus, it is possible that, like Ebola Virus and Adenoviruses, other viruses also encode proteins that undergo structural transformations, which help the viral proteins to perform different functions [ 388 ] . Consequently, future studies should continue to analyze the context-dependent effect of viral proteins on cell cycle progression as these may identify novel therapeutic targets for inhibiting viral replication in various cells as well as strategies for modulating cell cycle effects that contribute to diseases such as cancers. Moreover, these types of studies might also provide insights into the context-dependent effects of many viral proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1537, "end": 1544, "text": "[ 388 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF370"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2049, "text": "[ 388 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF370"}, {"start": 2348, "end": 2355, "text": "[ 389 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF371"}, {"start": 2806, "end": 2813, "text": "[ 388 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF370"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Perspectives"}, {"text": "Finally, alterations in normal cell cycle regulatory mechanisms can lead to the development of many human cancers, and viral infections have been linked to a signifi cant proportion of human cancers worldwide [ 12 , 15 ] .

The results of future studies that address the effects of virus-encoded proteins on the host cell cycle in authentic systems and in the context of viral replication may help generate new therapies that target viral proteins so as to inhibit viral replication and the development of virus-associated cancers. Moreover, these future studies could help identify novel cell cycle regulators and provide insights into many processes that infl uence cell transformation [ 16 , 17 ] . Cell cycle regulatory proteins that are targeted by viruses also offer potential targets for antiviral and anticancer therapies; drugs that target cellular proteins instead of viral proteins may help limit the development of drug resistance in these viruses and thus limit both their replication and their ability to cause diseases such as cancer.

Members of the Herpesviruses family are enveloped viruses that contain a large, double-stranded DNA genome that typically encodes 100-200 genes.

The Herpesvirus family is subdivided into the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-herpesviruses to distinguish various biological properties including host range and speed of replication. Within an infected cell, Herpesviruses can exist in a lytic state, where most genes are expressed and the virus is actively replicating, or in a latent state where a subset of genes are expressed and the virus is not generating infectious progeny.
