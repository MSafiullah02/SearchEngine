Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has become a growing threat to global health security [1] . Clinically, the disease is characterized with fever, cough, lymphopenia, dyspnea, and eventually respiratory failure and multiple organ damage in severe cases [2] . Immunosuppression after transplantation renders kidney transplant (KTx) recipients susceptible to a variety of viral pathogens. Several cases of transplant recipients with SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported [3] [4] [5] . However, epidemiological and clinical information characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infections in KTx recipients remains unknown. Here, we aimed to comprehensively describe epidemiological and clinical features in five KTx recipients infected with COVID-19. Our study findings are likely to be of considerable value for the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.",

All patients had undergone donation after cardiac death renal transplants between January 2016 and November 2019. Comorbidities included hypertension (n = 2), diabetes (n = 1), or bladder cancer (n = 1); the most common symptoms were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%; Table 1 ). At symptom onset, white blood cell and neutrophil levels of all patients were within normal range except in patient 2, but serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset ( Fig. 2A, 2B , 2E, and 2 F). On admission, five patients developed lymphopenia and an elevated Creactive protein (CRP) level, and proteinuria appeared in four patients (Fig. 2C, 2D , and 2 G and Table 2 ). During hospitalization, all patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir or arbidol); patients 2 and 3 also received antibacterial therapy (cefixime) and intravenous immunoglobulin, respectively. More importantly, triple immunosuppression with glucocorticoids, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) had been used in four recipients prior to symptom onset; however, after the onset of illness, the immunosuppressant was reduced or stopped in these four patients (Fig. 1) . In patients 1 and 3, the second chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed deterioration, but this resolved later, as shown in the third CT scans ( Fig. 1 and 3 ). As of March 4, 2020 four patients had improved chest CT findings, with three having negative NAT results twice in succession ( Fig. 1 and 4) .

Considering the normal chest CT scan, fever, anuria, hypercreatinemia, and leukocytosis at that time ( Fig. 1) , we regarded patient 2 as having acute transplantation rejection, in line with authoritative European Association of Urology guidelines on renal transplantation [7] . Thus, patient 2 was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500, 250, and 250 mg) for 3 d, after which the patient's fever abated, and urine output and serum creatinine levels returned to normal. However, a high fever resumed the next day, with a positive NAT for SARS-CoV-2 confirming that patient 2 had COVID-19. On admission, the urea (24.34 mmol/l) and creatinine (411.7 mmol/l) levels of patient 2 were the highest among these five patients, and the patient also had elevated white blood cell, neutrophil, and CRP levels ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ). After a week of hospitalization, the second CT scan for patient 2 showed a typical presentation of viral pneumonia. During hospitalization, despite the gradual disappearance of fever, patient 2 complained of dyspnea on exertion with normal oxygen saturation and refused to leave the isolation ward for a third CT scan (Fig. 1 ).",

After the outbreak of COVID-19, we identified five infected KTx recipients. While three patients had a suspected history of exposure, the incubation period concerning the other two patients was unclear (Fig. 1) . However, these two patients were residents of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, and their infection may have been due to exposure to undiagnosed, asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, specifically concerning patient 2, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, which involves greater immunosuppression and could be a predisposing factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis using throat swab specimens can confirm COVID-19 infection, false negatives are possible due to the sampling techniques, viral load of the upper respiratory tract, and mutations of the virus gene. For example, on illness day 21, the NAT result of patient 2 was not definitive, which suggests that trained technicians should conduct standard multisampling in strict accordance with protocols to improve the sensitivity of specimens. Apart from lower respiratory tract sampling, whole genome sequencing and detection of serum antibodies should be considered to optimize diagnostic methods.",

Although we could not explain this, lymphocytes have been identified as primary targets of SARS-CoV injury [8] . Notably, the absolute leukocyte and neutrophil value was increased in patient 2. However, because bacterial culture results were not available, the presence of bacterial coinfections could not be confirmed. It should also be noted that glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone, and acute rejection can contribute to increasing leukocytes and neutrophils on initiation [9] . Thus, the use of the leukocyte differential could be helpful in determining whether an abnormal number of leukocytes and neutrophils are due to bacterial coinfections, acute rejection, or initiation of methylprednisolone.",

Therefore, enhancing personal protection precautions, early identification, and timely management of affected cases are of crucial importance. Despite the lack of evidence on clinical efficacy, each patient in this study received antiviral therapy, and patients 2 and 3 also received antibacterial agent and intravenous immunoglobulin, respectively. Given the extent of lymphocytes shown to be consumed by SARS-CoV-2 [10] , MMF treatment was withdrawn in four patients. Moreover, glucocorticoids and tacrolimus dosages were also adjusted. There is no evidence to confirm the favorable effects of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 treatment [11] . Furthermore, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be inhibited by tacrolimus is unclear, although replication of SARS-CoV was diminished after tacrolimus treatment [12] . Notably, cyclosporine, another CNI drug, may be used as an option of hostdirected therapies for COVID-19 [13] . Strikingly, no significant kidney impairment was detected except in patient 2, implying that reducing immunosuppressive therapy for a short period would not lead to acute rejection. However, the long-term effect is uncertain. For patient 5, immunosuppressant use was not changed because of the relatively mild symptoms. The satisfactory clinical outcome of patient 5 suggested that an immunosuppressive maintenance dosage might not compromise the antiviral immune effect in relatively mild COVID-19 cases. In addition, aggressive reduction or withdrawal of the immunosuppressant should be considered cautiously only for recipients with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome [14] . More importantly, renal function should be monitored frequently because renal failure resulting from acute rejection could make treatment more difficult.",
