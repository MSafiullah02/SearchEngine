            "text": "Whereas the keratinized epithelium of the dermis and the mucous lining of the body cavities discourage pathogenic colonization, various other innate defenses are employed to minimize penetration of the body wall by microorganisms, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; otherwise known as host\u2010defense peptides) on mucosal surfaces.23, 24 A comprehensive review of AMPs in veterinary species has recently been published.25 In summary, AMPs comprise 3 main groups: digestive enzymes and peptides that disrupt the microbial cell membrane, peptides that bind essential elements, and peptides that act as decoys for microbial attachment. The 2 major classes of bactericidal AMPs in the mammalian immune system are the defensins and cathelicidins. Compared to eukaryotic cells, bacterial cell walls lack cholesterol\u2014which acts to stabilize cell membranes\u2014and negatively charged phospholipids. Instead, bacterial cell walls are rich in anions (basic amino acids) and thus attract the cationic defensins, which carpet the microbial membrane and institute channel formation.26 These channels then lead to transmembrane pore formation, membrane destabilization, and microbial cell death, although recent studies suggest that their function could go beyond that of lipid bilayer perturbation.27 Whereas a large number of AMPs form part of the non\u2010oxidative killing mechanism within phagolysosomes in cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, a growing number are thought to be actively secreted onto epithelial surfaces of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and urinary tracts28, 29, 30, 31\u2014including the ovine gastrointestinal tract32 and the canine testis.33 Recent work has revealed that important amounts of these AMPs are secreted not only by immune cells such as neutrophils and alveolar macrophages but also by atypical defense cells such as type II pneumocytes.34 This theme is universal throughout the processes of the innate immune system and challenges the traditional view of a \u201cstanding army\u201d of immune defense cells, replacing it with the concept of a body\u2010wide, integrated community of cells contributing to pathogen vigilance.35\n",

            "text": "Two factors are vital to the rapid ability of the innate immune system to respond to pathogen incursion: the presence of receptors against pathogen markers and the ubiquitous nature of these receptors in the body.35 Individual receptors are genetically encoded and display strong homology within and between species.22 These receptors are not only expressed on many effector cells of the immune system\u2014including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes\u2014but are also found on epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and myocytes36, 37; expression has also been detected in the bovine endometrium.38 The major targets of these pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are known as pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), although the presence of these molecules in nonpathogenic and commensal bacteria has led to the suggestion that the term \u201cmicrobial\u2010associated molecular patterns\u201d (MAMPs) is more accurate. These molecules share certain core characteristics: \nPAMPs are produced only by microbial pathogens, not by the host (eg, peptidoglycans are produced by bacteria but not by eukaryotic cells): this confers automatic self/nonself discriminatory ability.PAMPs are generally invariant molecules shared by entire classes of microorganisms (eg, lipoarabinomannan is found on the cell wall of all Mycobacteria); this allows the evolutionary retention of a relatively small number of PRRs recognizing vast numbers of potential pathogens.PAMPs are usually structures vital to the survival or pathogenicity of the microorganism (eg, lipopolysaccharide [LPS] in the outer membrane of Gram\u2010negative bacteria): this allows targeting of highly conserved molecules and obviates the need for variability in host PRRs.\n",

Inflammasome activity has also been linked to the phenomenon of immunoparalysis. Thus, the expression of mRNA encoding the key inflammasome components ASC, NALP1, and caspase\u20101 was decreased in human monocytes during early septic shock, thought to reflect monocyte deactivation; furthermore, NALP1 mRNA abundance was linked to survival in patients with sepsis.146 Very little is known about inflammasomes in the veterinary species, although inflammasome assembly mRNAs have been analyzed in the ovine jejunum147 and induction of inflammasome genes in the spleen was documented in septic pigs infected with either Haemophilus parasuis\n148 or Streptococcus suis.149\n",

In health, lack of TF exposure within the vascular system and the presence of various circulating proteins\u2014such as protein C, antithrombin, and tissue factor plasminogen inhibitor\u2014modulate coagulation by the prevention of TF activation.266, 335 The expression of TF by monocytes or macrophages and tissue parenchymal cells is activated by various inflammatory cytokines, CRP, and PAMPs such as LPS335, 338\u2014a phenomenon that has also been documented in cats339 and horses (earlier studies in this species citing \u201cprocoagulant activity\u201d rather than TF per se).340, 341, 342 Although findings differ between species, large numbers of TF\u2010expressing microparticles have been identified in blood samples from septic human patients and may correlate with mortality.343, 344 These microparticles are released from a variety of activated or apoptotic cells\u2014such as platelets, monocytes, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells\u2014and their interaction with endothelial cells and platelets drives the coagulation pathway.345, 346, 347 Although only an indirect measure, plasma von Willebrand factor concentrations were higher in septic dogs than those in healthy control animals, suggesting that endothelial cell activation also occurs in canine sepsis.348 Interestingly, platelets enhanced endotoxin\u2010induced equine monocyte TF activity in vitro341\n\u2014although whether microparticles derived from platelets or other sources play a role in the pathogenesis of equine sepsis in vivo remains unknown. Additional work in an equine model of endotoxemia has shown that large volume resuscitation has no impact on coagulation parameters beyond the changes attributed to endotoxemia, providing useful additional data to inform the treatment of sepsis in this species.349\n",

Endothelial cells also express tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin on their luminal surface and secrete tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However, the majority of these anticoagulant factors are negative acute phase proteins and thus plasma concentrations falling during sepsis. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines released during sepsis activate endothelial cells, platelets and circulating white blood cells, which begin to express tissue factor (TF) and lose surface anticoagulant proteins. Microparticle formation is increased, together with expression of functional adhesion molecules on platelets, microparticles, monocytes and endothelial cells. Plasma antithrombin, aPC, protein S, and TFPI concentrations fall; ADAMTS\u201013 activity also drops, leading to greater persistence of ultralarge von Willebrand factor, which further enhances platelet and microparticle activation and adhesion. After triggering of the contact activation (TF) pathway, the interaction of microparticles with endothelial cells and platelets further drives the coagulation pathway. The presence of coagulation pathway components (TF\u2010VIIa complex, Xa, Va, thrombin) and other circulating proteases activates endothelial protease\u2010activated receptors (PARs), which propagate the inflammatory process by stimulating the further release of mediators (TNF\u03b1, IL\u20106 and CXCL\u20108), platelet activation and cell death. Triggering of the contact phase system activates factor XII (Hageman factor), leading to the formation of kallikrein (KK) and bradykinin (BK).",
