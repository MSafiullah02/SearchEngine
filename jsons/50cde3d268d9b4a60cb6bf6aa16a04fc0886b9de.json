We analyzed data on endemic fluorosis collected in Ningxia, a typical high-fluorine area in the north of China. Fluorosis cases were identified in 539 villages in 1981, in 4449 villages in 2010, and in 3269 villages in 2017. These were located in 19 administrative counties. In 2017, a total of 1.07 million individuals suffered from fluorosis in Ningxia, with more children suffering from dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis. Among Qingshuihe River basin disease areas, the high incidence of endemic fluorosis is in Yuanzhou District and Xiji County of Guyuan City. The paper holds that the genesis of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis in Qingshui River basin is mainly caused by chemical weathering, evaporation and concentration, and dissolution of fluorine-containing rocks around the basin, which is also closely related to the semi-arid geographical region background, basin structure, groundwater chemical characteristics, and climatic conditions of the basin. The process of mutual recharge and transformation between Qingshui River and shallow groundwater in the basin is intense. There is a close coupling relationship between the power of central and southern Ningxia disease areas and Qingshui River watershed of excess fluorine water. Because the traditional drinking water source of the residents in the basin is shallow groundwater, the underground water is the main cause of the high incidence of endemic fluorosis. The results show that Xiji County and Yuanzhou District were the areas of high incidence of endemic fluorosis which gradually decreased to the middle and lower reaches of Qingshui River. In space, distribution characteristics are Qingshui River source area > Qingshui River valley basin area, tributary area > trunk stream area, upstream area > middle reaches area> downstream area of Qingshui River.

The Madongshan and Naijiahe Formations of the Lower Cretaceous Series in Qingshuiying and Hongliugou contain 193-932 mg/kg fluorine, and the Ganhegou Formations of the Neogene Miocene Series contain 629 mg/kg on average (Wu et al. 1999) , which is higher than the average fluoride content (420 mg/kg) in rocks in China. When groundwater flows through fluoride-bearing rocks, the fluoride can dissolve, resulting in higher fluoride concentrations in groundwater. Runoff water greatly fluctuates annually in the Qingshui River basin. The maximum annual runoff is 2.08 \u00d7 108 m 3 , approximately triple that of the minimum (0.67 \u00d7 108 m 3 ). The coefficient of variation (Cv) is 0.28. During the dry season, sources of river runoff mainly rely on the recharge of shallow groundwater, e.g., water in fissured bedrock and pore water in loose sediments. During the wet season, the flowing river has high water levels so the recharge sources are mainly from rainfall runoff. The main arm of the Qingshui River is mostly recharged through rainfall, tributary import, and lateral recharge of groundwater from both sides. Thereby, it is significantly impacted by geomorphology, climate, and local hydrogeological conditions. The fluorine concentration of Qingshui River surface water was determined, both for the main stream and for the tributary waters. The fluorine concentration of the main stream varied from 0.18 to 2.85 mg/L with 1.14 mg/L on average, and that of the tributary from 0.44 to 3.86 mg/L with 0.91 mg/L on average. The highest values for both waters were obtained in April during the dry season, and the lowest in July during the wet season (Fig. 5) . Values obtained in November were within these extremes. This reveals the significant role of surface runoff in regulating fluorine concentration in the surface water. During both the dry and wet seasons, the average fluorine concentration of main stream water was lower than that of tributary water, implying that the tributary water contributed significantly to the fluorine content of the main stream water. The higher concentration of fluorine in tributary water during the dry and wet periods was most likely caused by the confluence of groundwater containing high concentrations of fluorine. In November (normal season), the average fluorine concentration of main stream water was higher than that of tributary, implying that the import of tributary into main stream waters no longer exerted an additive effect on fluorine concentration. During the dry season, rivers are mainly replenished with groundwater, which in this case is rich in fluorine due to leaching from fluoride-bearing rocks. During the wet season, the rivers are mainly replenished via rainfall, thereby diluting the overall fluoride concentration. Nevertheless, the tributary waters produced higher concentrations, most likely because the main river was fed by upstream alluvial sources low in fluorine. During the normal season, the latter effect seemed to be weaker, resulting in higher fluorine concentrations in the main river.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 320, "text": "(Wu et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1733, "end": 1741, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Geological foundation for high concentrations of fluoride"}, {"text": "Other anions (Cl \u2212 , SO 4 2\u2212 , CO 3 2\u2212 , and HCO 3 \u2212 ) were also assessed in the water samples, as were the cations Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Mg + .

Lahermo described that the fluorine distribution in groundwater in Finland and East Africa was associated with the distribution of fluorite, granite, gneiss, and crystalline granite (Lahermo et al. 1991) . Indeed, the dissolution of fluorine-bearing minerals is commonly regarded as the source of fluorine in groundwater (McCaffrey and Willis 1993) .

Based on the historical 40 years data on endemic fluorosis and the spatial distribution and formation mechanism of high concentrations of fluoride in Qingshui River basin in Ningxia, this study concludes that there is a close coupling relationship in south-central Ningxia between the endemic areas of endemic fluorosis and the spatial and temporal distribution of excess fluorine water of Qingshui River basin. This relationship indicates that fluoride in the groundwater of the Qingshui River basin has long been affected by geological structures, low-lying and closed terrain, and drought. Qingshui River and shallow groundwater in the basin have a strong process of mutual resupply and transformation. And we consider the phreatic aquifer of the basin as the prominent contributor for endemic fluorosis because shallow groundwater is the main source of drinking water for a long time in this region. The temporal and spatial distribution of regional endemic fluorosis with long time series and its corresponding relation with water fluoride content in watershed were discussed. Then, we preliminarily concluded that the upper part of the basin is the high-incidence areas, and the middle and lower reaches are the middle and lower levels. The spatial distribution of villages and population of endemic fluorosis presents following features: headwater > river valley basin; mainstream > tributary; upstream > midstream > downstream. These distribution features are basically in agreement with the contour of fluoride in the groundwater and the spatial distribution of fluorine concentration in the phreatic aquifer in Qingshui River basin. This conclusion confirmed the source, settlement, and the change process of fluoride concentration in precipitation catchment in different seasons, and its influence on the endemic fluorosis areas. The results are of great significance in scientific research. However, the monitoring time series of the basin is relatively short in the research process, and there is still insufficient correspondence with the historical data of the disease, so further follow-up research is necessary. At the same time, this study is also of great practical significance for local governments to control endemic fluorosis. We believe that the Ningxia government should continue to carry out water improvement measures through the water diversion project of the Yellow River, so as to govern the endemic fluorosis in the Qingshui River basin from the source. Furthermore, implement \"targeted poverty alleviation\" and ecological migration poverty alleviation projects, and move the poor people in the uninhabitable endemic fluorosis areas to the Yellow River-irrigated oasis areas such as the plain and the high platform, with the Yellow River water as the main drinking water source, so as to thoroughly solve the situation of high incidence of endemic fluorosis in the areas.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Geo-chemistry genesis and health implications of fluoriferous ground waters in the upper regions of Ghana", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Apambire", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "O", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Boyle", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Michel", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1997, "venue": "Environ Geol", "volume": "33", "issn": "1", "pages": "13--18", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Use of abstraction regime and knowledge of hydrogeological conditions to control high-fluoride concentration in abstracted groundwater", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Carrillo-Rivera", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Cardona", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Edmunds", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "J Hydrol", "volume": "261", "issn": "1-4", "pages": "24--47", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Geochemical occurrence of arsenic, vanadium and fluoride in groundwater of Patagonia, Argentina: sources and mobilization processes", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Del Pilar Alvarez", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Carol", "middle": ["E"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2019, "venue": "J S Am Earth Sci", "volume": "89", "issn": "", "pages": "1--9", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Fluoride in drinking-water[M].
