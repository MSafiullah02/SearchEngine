Currently, Iridoviridae is classified into five genera, three of which, i.e., Ranavirus, Lymphocystivirus and Megalocytivirus, have been isolated from aquaculture species (reviewed by Chinchar et al., 2009). Megalocytivirus is known to cause disease in more than 30 farmed fish, notably mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi), large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea), rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), red sea bream (Pagrus major), sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicas), and members of Pleuronectiformes (Chen et al., 2003; He et al., 2000; Jeong et al., 2006; Kurita and Nakajima, 2012; Shi et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2011). Megalocytivirus infection can lead to 30%\u2013100% mortality, thus resulting in severe economic losses for the aquaculture industry (reviewed by Williams et al., 2005).",

Therefore, information on proteomic change in the host following viral invasion is important for studying the mechanism of host-virus interaction. Currently, comparative proteomic analysis has been broadly used for investigating protein expression under various conditions. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is one of the most powerful method to detect and quantify large amounts of proteins (Zheng et al., 2011). Comparing to conventional proteomic technologies, the advantage of this technique is that it is robust, sensitive, accurate, reproducible, and can detect low-abundance proteins (Sandin et al., 2014). In recent years, this technique has been used to examine proteome changes associated with host responses to many vital pathogens including West Nile virus, hepatitis B and C virus, pea seed-borne mosaic virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Cerna et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015).",

It is the first species of Pleuronectiformes with whole genome sequence completed (Chen et al., 2014). In previous studies, we observed that megalocytivirus RBIV-C1 is highly infectious to Pleuronectiformes, including tongue sole (Zhang et al., 2014, 2015; Zhang and Sun, 2015). Given the available genome information, tongue sole is a good model for the investigation of megalocytivirus infection. In this study, we aimed to identify globally the proteins of tongue sole involved in the process of megalocytivirus infection by employing the technique of label-free proteomics. For this purpose, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic analysis of the spleen proteins of tongue sole infected with and without RBIV-C1 at different time points, and examined the role of some of the differently expressed proteins in viral infection.",

The LFQ intensities of each protein per sample from MaxQuant outputs were loaded into Perseus 1.3 (Max Planck Institute, Germany). Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t-test with values of p < 0.05, and ratio >2 or <0.5 indicating significant differences.

As a negative control, nontargeted control siRNA (siCR) was synthesized based on Caenorhabditis elegans sequence, which has no homology to tongue sole sequences and has no predicted target genes in tongue sole genome. For in vivo transfection, each siRNA was diluted to 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl in PBS, and the transfection reagent EntransterTM-in vivo (Engreen Biosystem, Beijing, China) was diluted to 25% in PBS, and equal volumes of diluted siRNA and transfection reagent were mixed together. Tongue sole (average 11.8 g) were divided randomly into 14 groups (5 fish/group) and injected i.p. with 100 \u03bcl of each of the siRNAs described above; the control group of fish was injected with PBS. At 2 d post-injection, total RNA was extracted from the spleen of each of the five fish with EZNA Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Doraville, GA, USA) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Omega Bio-tek) according to manufacturer's instructions. The quality and integrity of the RNA were examined by determining 260/280 absorbance ratio using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo scientific, USA) and by gel electrophoresis. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with ReverAid\u2122 reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. The expression level of E3-L6, E3-L4, PAC2 and Pomp was determined by qRT-PCR in an Eppendorf Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) as described previously (Zhang et al., 2016) with the primer pairs E3-L6-RTF/E3-L6-RTR, E3-L4-RTF/E3-L4-RTR, PAC2-RTF/PAC2-RTR, and Pomp-RTF/Pomp-RTR, respectively (Table S1). The relative mRNA expression level of each gene was calculated using \u03b2-actin as an internal control (Long et al., 2014). PCR efficiency (E) and correlation coefficient (R2) were determined as reported previously, with negative control without cDNA included in each assay (Zhang et al., 2013b). Melting curve analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR to confirm that only one product was amplified and detected (Fig. S2). For each gene, qRT-PCR was performed five times with RNA from five different fish, and in each time of PCR, the reaction was run in triplicate. The siRNAs with the strongest inhibitory effect on E3-L6, E3-L4, PAC2 and Pomp expression were re-named siE3-L6, siE3-L4, siPAC2 and siPomp, respectively, and their sequences are shown in Table 2\n. This screening experiment was performed three times.",

In response to virus infection, the innate immune pathways are activated and a variety of cytokines and interferons (IFNs) are released (Mandelboim et al., 2001). IFNs have long been known to play an essential role in antiviral immunity (Gonzalez-Navaias et al., 2012). In our study, no IFNs proteins were detected among RBIV-C1-induced DEPs, but DEPs in the nature of IRFs, which are regulators of IFN transcription, were identified. Of the identified IRFs, previous reports showed that IRF3 is an important factor involved in modulating the transcription of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and IRF4 is expressed predominantly in immune cells and acts as a critical determinant for the regulation of downstream antiviral cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 (Lu et al., 2006). In fish, it has been shown that the expression of IRF3 gene could be stimulated by nervous necrosis virus and ploly (I:C) (Laghari et al., 2018; Labella et al., 2018), and IRF4 gene could be stimulated by rock bream iridovirus and ploly (I:C) (Bathige et al., 2012; Krasnov et al., 2013). In our study, we found that significantly up-regulated IRF3 and IRF4 proteins occurred at 8 dpi, suggesting a potential role of IRFs and the IFN system in the early immune defense against megalocytivirus.",

ISGs are initiated by IFNs and act as primary factors in controlling the replication and spread of virus in vivo (Morales and Lenschow, 2013). In fish, some ISGs, such as viperin, ISG15, ISG56, Mx, tripartite motif (TRIM) 8, TRIM39, and PKR (interferon-inducible double-stranded rna-dependent protein kinase activator a), have been shown to be antiviral effectors capable of limiting viral replication (reviewed by Poynter and DeWitte-Orr, 2016). In this study, we detected three ISG proteins, i.e., Mx, ISG44, and ISG15, up-regulated by RBIV-C1. Mx is one of the most studied fish ISGs, which is induced by type I IFN and exhibits antiviral properties in a wide range of fish, notably infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) infected Atlantic salmon (Larsen et al., 2004), hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infected Japanese flounder (Caipang et al., 2003), nodavirus infected grouper (Chen et al., 2008) and barramundi (Wu et al., 2010). ISG15 is a small, ubiquitin-like molecule with numerous antiviral functions including inhibition of virus release and ISGylation of both viral and host proteins, and it also shows broad antiviral activities against a number of fish viruses including grouper nervous necrosis virus (GNNV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), VHSV, and RBIV-C1 (Huang et al., 2013; Langevin et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012). The up-regulation of ISGs detected in our study is consistent with these previous observations and suggests that, like in other teleost, ISGs likely play an important role in the antiviral immunity of tongue sole.",

TRIM family is an emerging group of antiviral ISGs, and members of this family are believed to interfere with early and late stages of viral infection (reviewed by Nisole et al., 2005). Fish have a large number of TRIMs compared to mammals, but the antiviral functions of fish TRIMs are barely known, except that TRIM8, TRIM32, and TRIM39 genes were detected in some virus-infected fish or fish cells (Huang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017). In Atlantic salmon, TRIM16 was detected to be up-regulated by infectious salmon anaemia virus (Workenhe et al., 2009); in orange spotted grouper, TRIM16 was up-regulated by Singapore grouper iridovirus in the early stage, and negatively regulated the antiviral immune response (Yu et al., 2016) In contrast, we found that the TRIM16-like protein was down-regulated by RBIV-C1 at 8 dpi, suggesting that TRIM16 expression may be regulated differently by different virus and in a time-dependent manner. Besides TRIM16-like and TRIM35, another ISG protein, i.e. PKR, was found to be down-regulated at 12 dpi in RBIV-C1-infected tongue sole. PKR members are known to function as both pattern recognition receptors and antiviral effectors, and they play important roles in anti-viral immune response through multiple ways, including inhibiting viral protein translation, activating NF-\u03baB and inducing apoptosis of virus-infected cells (Balachandran et al., 2000). Previous studies showed that in response to host immune response, some viruses have developed diverse strategies of evasion, for example, Ranavirus and capripoxvirus are able to modulate PKR protein activity, and adenovirus and IPNV can block PKR and Mx expression (Grayfer et al., 2012; Scott and Nel, 2016; Wakabayashi et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018). Given the potential antiviral properties of TRIM16-like, TRIM39, and PKR, the down-regulated expression of these proteins observed in our study suggested that they may be targeted by RBIV-C1 during infection, and the virus negatively modulated the expression of these proteins to suppress the host's immune reactions.",

            "text": "Interaction of virus with specific host cell surface receptors is a critical step for viral infection (Guo et al., 2012). Integrins are a large family of conserved \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimeric cell surface receptors, some of which can serve as receptors or coreceptors for viruses such as adenovirus, hantavirus, and herpesvirus (Arnaout et al., 2005; Feire et al., 2004; Mou et al., 2006; Wickham et al., 1993). A previous study on white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) indicated that shrimp \u03b2-integrin can bind to the WSSV envelope protein VP187 and may function as a cellular receptor for WSSV (Li et al., 2007). In our study, three down-regulated integrin proteins were found at 8 dpi, including both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of integrin. Besides integrin, we also detected 3 up-regulated mannose receptors (MR) at 8 dpi. MR is a transmembrane protein involved in phagocytosis and endocytosis via its ability to interact with bacteria, yeast, parasites, and viruses, and it is a cell surface receptor for many viruses including HIV, Visna/Maedi virus, Influenza A Virus, and Dengue Virus (Crespo et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2008; Stahl and Ezekowitz, 1998; Trujillo et al., 2007; Upham et al., 2010). Given these previous findings, the altered expression of integrin and MR found in our study suggests a possible involvement of these proteins in the interaction between RBIV-C1 and the cells of tongue sole during early infection.",

Nuclear import of the viral genome is a highly selective process that requires cargo proteins containing nuclear localization signals and importin that meditates nuclear import (Wente and Rout, 2010). Consistently, in RBIV-C1-infected fish, we found 6 up-regulated importins at 8 dpi. Once the viral genome is imported into the nucleus, transcription and translation of the viral genes take place, during which, some host cellular molecules, such as transcription factors and translation initiation factors, are utilized by virus (Sengupta et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2015). Similarly, in our study, we observed up-regulated transcription factors and translation initiation factor 4 and 6 proteins in RBIV-C1-infected tongue sole. Besides these factors, we also detected pre-mRNA-processing factor and DNA-directed RNA polymerase II proteins, suggesting employment of host molecules for the transcription and translation of viral genome.",

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major intracellular protein degradation and regulation pathway that plays a key role in diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle, signal transduction, host immune response, endocytosis, and signal transduction (Foo and Chee, 2015). Evidences show that UPS is important for the uncoating, nucleus entry, genome transcription and translation, and the budding process of many mammalian viruses including herpesvirus, poxvirus, hepadnavirus, adenovirus, influenza viruses, retrovirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, picornavirus and rotavirus (reviewed by Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002; Calistri et al., 2014). In fish, the function of UPS is largely unknown. However, UPS genes were reported to be regulated in IHNV-infected rainbow trout and ISKNV-infected mandarin fish (He et al., 2006; Liang and Cui, 1982). A recent study showed that mandarin fish UPS components can be utilized by ISKNV, suggesting a potential involvement of UPS in virus-host interaction (Huang et al., 2017). Likewise, in our study, 12 UPS related proteins were regulated by RBIV-C1, including E2, E3 ubiquitin, PAC2, and Pomp. Of these proteins, PAC2 and Pomp are important to the process of proteasome assembly and maturation (reviewed by Budenholzer et al., 2017). In line with this fact, we found that overexpression of PAC2 and Pomp in tongue sole significantly enhanced viral replication, while knockdown of these genes or inhibiting the function of UPS significantly inhibited viral replication. These results suggest that UPS is essential to viral infection, and this property of UPS may have been utilized by RBIV-C1 to facilitate viral propagation by up-regulating UPS expression during infection. Unlike PAC2 and Pomp, E3-L6 and E3-L4 knockdown had no apparent effect on viral replication. Since E3 ubiquitin ligases, which determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination, exist in hundreds of different forms (Gao et al., 2013), it is likely that the E3 ubiquitin ligases examined in our study are not the major ones targeted by RBIV-C1, or the functions of these two E3 ligases are replaceable by other members of E3 ligases.",
