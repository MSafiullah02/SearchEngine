The torch of the Seventh National Olympics (1993) was lit there by Jia Lanpo, a legendary anthropologist who discovered three Peking Man skulls in 1936. Named The Flame of Civilization, the torch was relayed to Tiananmen Square, where a massive rally was awaiting. In July 2005, to celebrate the commencement of a cultural plaza in Beijing designed for the Olympics, Liu Dongsheng (1917 , also a senior anthropologist, lit the torch by the same method and passed it on to actors who were half-naked, covering their lower bodies with tree leaves and animal furs, to start a relay with the torch being carried by cultural and athletic celebrities. Photos of the ceremonial fire making in the cave is still displayed online (People's Daily, March 27, 2008) . Upon its arrival at the plaza, the director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, along with Beijing's deputy mayor, took over the torch to ignite \"the Altar of the Sacred Flame and restart the fire of human civilization.\" When China hosted the 2008 summer Olympics, the route of the Olympic torch in the Beijing area began in Zhoukoudian, where a mass rally over the whole day was organized with various patriotically themed activities. Online photos show that the ceremonial relay started at the site of Peking Man's bronze head statue which projects facial features of the national ancestor. Feng Gong, the torch bearer and a very popular actor, was proudly holding the torch high and was escorted by a bodyguard. The same bodyguards also appeared on the torch's global multi-city relay in the same year to fend off various groups of people protesting Beijing's hosting of the Olympics (People's Daily, August 8, 2008) .",

            "text": "Since the discovery of the fossils, Chinese anthropologists have interpreted ash-like remains at the site as evidence of Peking Man's capability with fire, which was believed to be the earliest among the world's primitive hominids. This hypothesis transformed itself into a national pride and the popular perception that ascribes the use of fire to the creation of not only Chinese but also global civilizations. The general reader often takes it for granted that fire was created by wood drilling, unaware of the fact that fire lit by accidental lightening had long preceded fire obtained by artificial methods. As early as the 1930s, under a Nationalist government, a popular narrative of the national ancestry myth titled \"From Prehistoric Human to the Chinese\" had already claimed that \"We pioneered in human evolution and made human civilization bloom. Our ancestor lit up the fire so we could be illuminated. How can the Chinese today not be awakened and inspired!\" (Yen 2015, p. 614) . Half a century later, the CCP's official narrative regarding Peking Man's use of fire went from strong nationalist pride to a claim of international acknowledgement of China's leading role in world civilizations: \"Making and using fire was the glorious first attempt in the history of mankind to control nature.\u2026 The Chinese nation has never given up its unyielding struggle for survival and pursuit for proliferation [and] the fire for hope has never extinguished. \u2026 This spirit will inspire China in the new century and the new millennium to ensure the great revival of the Chinese nation\" (CCTV 2000.2) . Historical tourism proclaims, \"[w]e can say without any exaggeration that the fire in Zhoukoudian illuminated the world\" (Wenweipo Daily 2011). International archaeologists' disagreement with the Chinese interpretation of the ash-based evidence is often perceived as a challenge to China from the West, as media report suggests (Yang 2015) . The fire lit by Peking Man is also treated on the first pages of history textbooks and highlighted in exercises and exams (Ye 2012; Qu 2013) , often along with a map of the distribution of primitive hominids all over China. A history teacher shared with his colleagues his didactic instruction methods that stretch the patrilineal imaginations of students into an unmeasurable past: \"You ask them: 'How old are you?' 'How old is your father?' 'How old is your grandfather?' And so on. As students answer these questions, you help them calculate '100 years, 1000 years, 10,000 years, 400,000 or 500,000 years and one million years', and so on to establish basic concepts of the long history of our fatherland\" (Wei 1984, p. 46) .",

Popular culture digs deeper underneath the sundry facts of chronology and relics to attribute the assumed longevity of the Chinese people and civilization to virtues of their ancestors, reflected in a drama titled Primitive Love of Peking Man. As a music, dance, and epic drama, a genre usually reserved for programs of political significance, it pays tribute to Gen (\u6839 \"root\"), the protagonist whose single-character name indicates his ancestral status. A patriarch of a Peking Man group, Gen 's valor and shrewdness are key to the survival of the small family group, but his privileged status in the competition for females causes grievance from the young cavemen. As he grows older, he realizes that he can no longer produce healthy offspring to carry on the lineage, so he allows his young rivals to share his female companions. In the finale he throws himself into a bone fire to let others consume his barbequed flesh in a desperate food shortage created by a harsh winter. \"Thank you, our ancestor!\"-the drama's poster highlights the fact that the virtue of altruism for the survival of the collective has been part of Chineseness since the very beginning of the race (CRJ Online 2010).",

However, by the end of the drama, in the flame of sacrifice, all sensual scenarios and expectations are sublimated to a tribute to an ancestral hero's altruism. The fire lit by Peking Man thus not only reflects an overarching theme of Chinese nationalism-an anxiety for the survival of the nation and a call for sacrificial patriotismbut also dramatizes the argument made by anthropologists in their debate with geneticists: fire making technology likely enabled Peking Man's descendants to survive the Ice Age while their counterparts elsewhere went extinct, as we will discuss later.",

            "text": "In 2001, The Journal of Asian Studies published an article titled \"Peking Man and the Politics of Paleoanthropological Nationalism in China\" by Barry Sautman. It attempted to divert scholarly attentions on Chinese nationalism in post-Mao China from the focus on \"'high politics' or the foreign policy of party-state elites\" to more cultural and social trends by examining a state-sponsored discourse that adapted a body of complex scholarship of both the archeology and the anthropology of the Stone Age to identify the Chineseness personified by Peking Man. Sautman's research played a pioneering role in the 1 Unlike the names of other famous sites of primitive human habitats, such as Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, or those found in China, which derive from the names of the immediate localities of the discovery, Davidson Black, a Canadian anatomist and physical anthropologist who supervised and authenticated the discovery in 1929, named the fossils Sina anthropuspekinensis, popularly known as Peking Man, despite the fact that the site is about fifty kilometres from metropolitan Peking. The name was literarily translated into Chinese as \"Beijing People.\" Had it been named \"Zhoukoudian Man,\" or even \"Longguo Hill Man\" (Longguo Hill, meaning \"hill of dragon bones,\" and which was the name of the immediate site where Peking Man fossils were discovered), it perhaps would have sounded less magical to Chinese nationalism. discussion by establishing some key arguments and analytical concepts. He agreed with some scholars' preliminary observation that in a time of racial nationalism's retreat in most major states, Chinese nationalism had shown more \"official efflorescence\" expressed in the concept of blood ties. As he stated: \"Official PRC paleoanthropology undergirds a Chinese patriotism that resonates with a folk taxonomy that understands 'race' as an evident, natural, fundamental, pervasive, omni-historical, and biologically significant division of the world's people.\" The so-called \"politics of paleoanthropological nationalism\" was its manifestation. Sautman defined this politics of paleoanthropological nationalism in the Chinese rejection of the internationally accepted Out-of-Africa theory regarding the monogenetic origin of modern humans by insisting on a polygenetic origin to support an independent progenitor of H. sapiens in China. Behind this nationalist assertion of a native origin was a bolder \"Sinocentric evolutionary theory\" held by some Chinese scholars. Sautman's data were mainly drawn from scholarly discussions, media reports, and talks by high-ranking leaders'. Sautman convincingly revealed a strong consciousness among Chinese scholars of the political sensitivity attached to the discussion on fossils, and he dialectically portrayed the nationalist Peking Man narrative as \"a kind of reverse teleology, in which the present-day nation is projected as the inevitable consequence of evolution\" (Sautman 2001, p. 104) . For Sautman, this Chinese discourse was a pronounced case of racial nationalism, which \"holds that each of us can trace our identities to a discreet community of biology and culture whose 'essence' has been maintained through time\" (Sautman 2001, p. 95) .",

            "text": "The key point in understanding this seemingly esoteric discussion involves a debate between the world's mainstream paleoanthropologists and their Chinese peers. While the former adopt the theory first proposed by Allen Wilson and Rebecca Cann in their famous 1987 collaboration \"Mitochondrial DNA and Human Evolution\" and believe that both H. erectus and H. sapiens originated in Africa, that modern humans are the descendants of the H. sapiens who migrated out of Africa as early as one hundred and twenty-five thousand years and as late as sixty thousand years ago and replaced the previous H. erectus groups worldwide, the latter claims that the H. erectus group that had arrived in the land of what is today's China had independently evolved into H. sapiens. Ordinary readers may construe the meaning of the debate simply as a question regarding whether the Chinese share a common modern human origin with the rest of the world, and if not, then exactly how old are they-one million or two million years? Sigrid Schmalzer's 2008 book, People's Peking Man: Popular Science and Human Identity in Twentieth Century China, is a comprehensive study of the role of Peking Man in the PRC's ideological indoctrination and political socialization against a backdrop of how modern states have used scientific education to shape citizenship. Such a political agenda in the PRC established a human identity free from the influence of the Christian creation myth and folk religious superstitions regarding the origin and evolution of mankind, and helped to promote socialist ethics that exalted physical work by using Peking Man-believed to have been able to use tools-as an example of what Frederick Engels argued in his The Part Played by Labor in the Transition from Ape to Human. This official effort in popular science to some extent led Schmalzer to arrive at the conclusion that it was in the early years of the PRC that Peking Man's status as the national ancestor was officially established, despite the fact that prior to 1949 some propagandists of the Nationalist regime had ventured to do so out of nationalist political agenda. However, she agreed with Sautman that \"a nationalist state agenda has worked to privilege scientific theories that root Chinese ethnic identity in the remote past,\" which emphasized \"the longevity of the Chinese as a biological race and the connection of this race to the Chinese land.\" She also agreed that such a trend had accelerated from the 1980s.",

Second, even in the political motive, a claim for China's central role in the origin of humans-\"a question more of prestige in international science\"-was more prominent than ethnic identity. Third, the construction of \"a concept of a biological race\" is \"simultaneously destabilized by other meanings produced by scientists, laypeople, and the state itself.\" Finally, many individual Chinese regard human fossils such as Peking Man \"not simply as early representatives of their nation or race,\" but also as \"family, community, regional, professional, and human identities\" (Schmalzer 2008, pp. 248-250) .",

They involve the late Qing dynasty and the PRC, but focus on the Nationalist era, a time critical to the transition from a multi-ethnic empire to a modern nation state. This transition was notably disrupted by Japan's encroachment and invasions in the 1930s, which made Peking Man a timely and meaningful discovery for Chinese nationalism.

Facing a rather messy history of heterogeneous ethnic and racial components as well as the power relations among them that could lead them to see each other as the Other, Chinese scholars in the early twentieth century worked strenuously to seek \"scientific proof of this unitary national imaginary.\" While one narrative identifies the source of such unity in the common origin for all members of the Chinese nation, the other describes the nation as a result of a gradual and evolutionary \"melting\" of the whole. While both imagined the Chinese nation of the time as a community of common consanguinity, the common origin discourse took the ancestors of the Han people as the springboard of such a community, explicitly identifying the Yellow Emperor (along with some other sage kings praised in Han folklore) first and Peking Man later as the ancestor of the entire Chinese nation.",

Gu and his followers were thus called \"doubters of antiquity.\" \"The government does not have to lie, telling us that we have descended from the same ancestor,\" such was Gu's political denunciation of the officially endorsed national origin myth in the late 1920s. Gu argued for a theory that recognized the multiple ethnic and racial origins of the Chinese nation, and he believed that such a theory not only reflected historical truth but also would not hurt the shared consciousness of a unified Chinese nation. On the contrary it honored contributions to the formation of the nation made by non-Han peoples, and would therefore help national unity.",

The most adamant and confident advocate for Peking Man's ancestorship was Xiong Shili, a very influential cultural conservative and neo-Confucian philosopher, who held a series of lectures on Chinese history at the Central Military Academy in 1939. Xiong told his audience that \"[a]mong the descendants of Peking Man, one branch remained in the Divine Land [\u795e\u5dde, meaning China] and became today's Han lineage,\" while the others spread in all directions and became the ancestors of the principle non-Han minorities (Leibold 2006, pp. 203-205) .",

Since the process of nation-state making demands the inclusion and binding of all ethnic and racial groups within the national borders, an antiquarianism of such border formation values Peking Man and other primitive humans found in China today as the most undeniable evidence of the existence of a historical China that has continued through a bloodline originated from those lithic-era sites. In the 1930s and 1940s, many Chinese nationalist scholars had suggested that Peking Man was the common progenitor of all the peoples in China. By the time of the early PRC, as Leibold believes, the need for defining borders and uniting different ethnic groups became more urgent as well as realistic under a centralized nation state, and \"Peking Man was now clearly positioned as the direct, linear ancestor of H. sapiens, the yellow race, and the zhonghua minzu (\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf Chinese nation)\" (Leibold 2012, p. 346) .

In her article \"Evolutionary Asiancentrism, Peking Man, and the Origins of Sinocentric Ethno-Nationalism\" that covers the period between the 1920s and the 1940s, Hsiao-Pei Yen extended the discussion to emphasize the \"invention\" of Peking Man's national ancestor status as the result of \"negotiations between scientific universalism (or internationalism) and nationalist commitments\" (Yen 2015, p. 591) . The discovery and authentication of Peking Man fossils, according to Yen, was due to many foreign anthropologists' hopes and efforts in finding a human ancestor of lithic age in Asia, especially in what is today's north and west China. The driving force of this paradigm shift was the discovery of more early hominid evidence in Asia and had nothing to do with Chinese nationalism, but its result was read and exploited by the latter which helped to construct a national identity with racial implications. As a matter of fact, since that time, the negotiations between scientific cosmopolitanism and its nationalist appropriation have continued to characterize academic and popular discussions regarding Peking Man.",

All authors agree that the Chinese discussions about Peking Man-and more broadly, paleoanthropology and prehistorical archaeology-serve a nationalist agenda with its racial implications. However, there is not only a divergence regarding the significance of such a racial aspect in the nationalism, but also and more importantly a lack of a theoretical explanation as to why the discourse is racial, although simply by creating and applying those concepts a reader informed by fundamental knowledge about racial thinking can clearly see the association between them. This theoretical elaboration is necessary not only because it will effectively engage the Chinese defence that has rejected even nationalist-let alone racial-implications of the discourse, but also because it will contribute to our understanding of the varieties of scientific racism that appear to have nothing to do with a harmful or even dangerous racist agenda.",

Third, while acknowledging the archeological ground for the China-origin Chinese (COC) theory, the chapter nonetheless reveals in detail the academic debate between the two theories regarding the origin of people. While geneticists in general hold a belief in Africaoriginated Chinese (AOC), anthropologists continue to defend the COC theory. The debate has carried and enhanced political sensitivity as a result of the discourse strategies employed. In other words, the issue is scientific (there is indeed archeological evidence in favor of the COC theory), but the way it is addressed in many situations reads in a political way. Fourth, the chapter shows how lay supporters of both the AOC and COC theories fully understand the nationalist implications immersed in such a professional debate and have engaged each other in a public discussion through various media channels. This new phenomenon reflects the sociopolitical impact of scientific debates in a time of mass media and social media, and is analyzed in light of a broader national ideological divide between ultranationalists and liberal-oriented groups.

The fact that society scientifically accepts the AOC theory cannot obscure the fact that the COC theory still serves the nationalist agenda. On the contrary, the coexistence of the two facts only enhances the tension within Chinese nationalist politics, and forces COC advocates to seek a more effective discourse strategy that often appeals to concepts and terminologies that are more racialized or simply racist when judged by international standards. Inspired by international studies of similar discourses dubbed such as H. europaeus, H. alpinus, and H. israelensis, which constructed various imagined ancestors who bequeathed essentialized communal traits to their posterity, this Chinese discourse can be called \"H. sinensis,\" with a much more prehistoric and therefore biological root to it. Mystifying its association with the land, this H. sinensis collaborates with the rising racial nationalism expressed in pop music introduced and analyzed in the previous chapter, which epitomizes Chineseness with explicit racial taxonomies. Further, it advances this nationalism by elevating Chinese civilization among the world's civilizations with a claim for an incontestably greatest antiquity, and creating a most cohesive force for nationalist mobilization by establishing a common bloodline.",

The HGP was launched in 1990 by the United States and comprised four developed nations. By decoding and mapping all the genes in the human genome, this post-Cold War global collaboration had an immense impact on the determination and preservation of human genetic distinction and diversity, therefore its results can also be read as \"a history book-a narrative of the journey of our species through time\" (National Human Genome Research Institute 2012).

In China, concerns and debates emerged over possible gene outflow to the West and even alleged gene weapons particularly devised to sap the Chinese nation.

However, this concern still persists and is dramatized in popular culture. A recent movie titled War Wolf (\u6218\u72fc1) includes scenrio of international genetic weapons developers using stolen \"Chinese DNA\" to make biochemical weapons to attack China.

Key to this affiliation was Tan Jiazhen, a founding figure of Chinese genetics who studied at Caltech in the 1930s with Thomas Hunt Morgan, the father of modern genetics. In the 1950s, after returning to China, Tan resisted Soviet criticism of genetics-especially Morgan's theory-as Western bourgeois science and strove for the survival of the science in China. 3 He urged the Chinese state to join the HGP in the 1990s by using his contacts among Chinese leaders, 4 and succeeded in getting Fudan-his home institution-to become the southern center for China's genomic research. He also helped to connect China's young geneticists to the international scientific community. Among those scholars, the most important figures include Jin Li, a geneticist trained in the United States and a research scientist at the Human Genetics Center, University of Texas-Houston (HGUT) in the late 1990s; Chu Jiayou, from the Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, who was also a visiting scholar in the United States in the 1990s; and Su Bin, a postdoctoral fellow at HGUT in the late 1990s. Their international connections made them more aware of the relationship between the Out-of-Africa theory and the HGP, and they also knew that the data supporting that theory did not cover China. 5 Intrigued by the contradiction between this international mainstream science and their nationalist belief, they saw Chinese participation as an opportunity to test both.",

Branches of the social sciences and humanities have also felt the impact with nationalist and ethnic nationalist implications. One such field is that of linguistics. Quentin Atkinson's hypothesis that the phoneme roots of many native languages can be traced back to Africa-an evolutionary linguistic school inspired by the Out-of-Africa theory-is echoed among Chinese linguists in their search for the origin of the Chinese language (Yao 2010) . Ethnography has become more prominent in ethnic studies as molecular anthropology has become more popular, diverting attention from textual and material culture analysis to lab results of population genetic surveys, leading to the reinterpretation of the origin and migration of many ethnic minority peoples and their relations with the Han and the Han-dominated state (Jin and Chu 2006, pp. 227-240) . One intriguing result is the discussion on the demic-diffusion model of Han expansion in southern China-as opposed to the traditional cultural diffusion model, i.e., Han expansion resulted from non-Han peoples' adoption of more civilized Han culture-which shows a predominant pattern of a DNA mix of Han-males and non-Han females in southern China's Han population. This result was also first published by Nature (Wen et al., September 16, 2004) . By interpretation, this could suggest a tantalizing concept of a longue dur\u00e9e internal gender-based colonization.",

The IVPP was formerly the Research Department of the Cainozoic Era (RDCE) at the Institute of Geological Survey of China in the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, established in 1929, the year of the discovery of the Peking Man fossils. The institute's history was essentially a result of Sino-Euro-American scientific collaboration, 6 which not only trained the first generation of Chinese anthropologists and archaeologists, but also laid the foundations for the COC theory. Franz Weidenreich , an anthropologist at the University of Chicago known for his multiregional hypothesis of human evolution, was honorary director of the RDCF in the mid-1930s and that experience played a role in the formation of his theory. Most COC advocates such as Pei Wenzhong (the discoverer of the first Peking Man skull in 1929), Jia Lanpo, and Yang Zhongjian (coordinator of Zhoukoudian's excavation in the 1930s), were trained on site by Western anthropologists and then became elders in the IVPP. They were even all buried in Zhoukoudian at their request. Official historical narrative elevates their professional careers as patriotic commitment, as elsewhere anthropologists and archaeologists who helped in constructing national history become nationalist heroes. Today, among the IVPP's researchers, Wu Xinzhi, Huang Wanbo, and Gao Xin are ardent defenders of the COC theory.",

Morphological and anatomical evidence include such physical features as a flat-fronted face with projecting cheekbones, shovel-shaped incisors, a low nasal bone, and rectangular-shaped eye sockets. Evidence from cultural remains shows that quartz and sandstone tools fashioned by a chopping action seem dominant from 1.7 million years ago to about thirty thousand years ago, but in Africa and the Middle East (a corridor for the journeys of H. erectus and H. sapiens \"Out-of-Africa\"), tool-making technology seems more advanced and obsidian hand axes are commonly found. So the COC argument is that if the AOC theory is true, then why didn't those African-originated H. sapiens bring that technology to China (Wu 2006; Gao 2010; .2)? More generally, for COC supporters, a nationwide distribution of thousands of archeological sites of both H. erectus and H. sapiens makes any scenario of a complete replacement by a single foreign species hard to believe.",

Wu, the chief opponent of the AOC theory, who used fossil data from East Asia to propose a multiregional evolution model for modern humans with the American Milford H. Wolpoff and the Australian Alan G. Thorne (1939 Thorne ( -2012 (Wolpoff et al. 1984 ). Wu has since maintained that \"four main races in the world all linked to a more archaic human species in their respective locations, all native born\" (Wu 2003) . Wu told the newspaper that fossils were the most direct evidence while DNA was indirect and fragmentary. 7 As he stated, \"Over the last 50 years, Chinese archaeologists have found many sites of paleoanthropological fossils and more than a thousand locations of Paleolithic culture remains. [They show] that there were no discontinuities between H. erectus, represented by Peking Man, and the modern Chinese, and [the evolution was] an 'expansion like a river network with small amount of interbreeding'\" (Huashengbao, June 15, 2000) . Three months later in an article titled \"Is Peking Man Still Our Ancestor?\" Wu reiterated the possibility of an incidental interbreeding between African-originated and China-evolved H. sapiens (Wu 2000) . This referred to some anatomical features of H. sapiens found in China, such as round-shaped eye sockets and a projecting occipital bone, which appeared more common in Europe (Wu 2003) . This revisionist reconciliation with genetics is yet to be supported by critical evidence, although geneticists have recently begun to suggest a similar scenario in regard to Neanderthal Man (Green et al., May 7, 2010; P\u00e4\u00e4bo 2014) . As he was opposed to a phylogenetic tree concept of both H. erectus and H. sapiens with Africa as the common root, Wu accepted the former but insisted on his \"river network [meaning a multiple source of origin] with a small amount of interbreeding\" hypothesis for the latter's global evolution. With a multiregional evolution with incidental mixing, rather than a single African-origin mutation and replacement, Wu's model for H. sapiens has been the COC's theoretical paradigm.",

They also call attention to the difficulty in determining the relatedness between two human groups simply by matching facial and skull resemblances, which could be subject to the existing perception of the observers. More importantly, they point to a breakage of archaeological evidence in the assumed evolutionary continuity found in China. This breakage is an absence of evidence of fossils and cultural remains for the time between one hundred thousand years ago and forty thousand years ago, a key stage in which H. sapiens (early modern humans) evolved into H. sapiens sapiens (the complete modern human). As Jin Li and others have explained, this breakage is not an accident but was created by the quaternary glacier which caused the extinction of many species globally, and following which a new H. sapiens migrated from Africa and spread all over the world (Jin and Chu 2006, pp. 234-235) . To this, anthropologists have argued that the climate in some parts of East Asia during the Ice Age was relatively milder and because primitive humans there had been able to make fire, they might well have been able to survive the cold. Therefore the fire made in the Zhoukoudian caves once again set the ancestors of the Chinese apart from their peers elsewhere, a technical plausibility moralized in the drama Primitive Love of Peking Man. Since the debate started, the main task of anthropologists has been to find the missing link evidence that will testify to the survival of Peking Man's descendants throughout the Ice Age.",

These anthropologists are fully aware of the political implications of the discussion, since Wilson and Cann's finding is seen as a scientifically decisive blow to white racism, and call the subject \"a public discipline,\" referring to non-professional interest in the discussion. They feel their academic standing is often mistaken for polygenism by the public, an outdated anthropological theory of the parallel evolution of human races from the genesis that had lent credence to racism in the past.

In 1983, Wolpoff invited Wu to the United States on a National Science Foundation fellowship based in the University of Michigan, Wolpoff's home institution.

Jin's remarks show that he is conscious of the implications of his research for Chinese nationalism, and he seemed delighted about the common origin of Chinese and other modern humans, Before the project [i.e., the project leading to the 2001 Science report] started, I was hoping that I could identify or would be able to find evidence to support an independent origin of the Chinese in China, because I am Chinese, I came from China, and through the educational process I always believed there was something special about Chinese.\" [To Roberts' question \"How did you feel as a Chinese person?\" Jin answered] \"After I saw the evidence generated in my laboratory, I think we should all be happy with that, because, after all, modern humans from different parts of the world are not too different from each other and we are all very close relatives. (Roberts, BBC 2009) However, when facing domestic media, Jin sounds more neutral. When interviewed by CCTV's program Where did the Chinese come from?, Jin only emphasizes his initial doubt about the validity of the Outof-Africa theory for the origin of the Chinese and his hope for a kind of \"different result\" from the data to be collected in China (CCTV 2011). 8 In his other public talks, he rarely makes any reference to a Chinese identity to which Peking Man is attributed, despite his staunch position on the validity of his team's findings in answer to the question \"from where did we come?\" (Jin 2005) . He never asks the public and the state to reconsider the popular veneration of Peking Man and has avoided using words such as nationalism, patriotism, and even history education.",

It is not only for scientific purposes but also social purposes. To debunk Peking Man's ancestorship matters more than an act of simply telling the scientific truth. For example, Rao Yi, Dean of the School of Life Science of Beijing University who obtained his Ph.D. in the United States and returned to China after he had established himself as a prominent scientist in the international life science field, told students in his public speech titled \"What Type of People Do You Want Yourself To Be?\" that \"the so-called Peking Man is not the ancestor of any of us who are sitting here today.\" He went on to delineate the route of human evolution and the migration of H. sapiens into China (Rao 2016). Rao is known for his criticism of China's institutional deficiencies in education and research and his skepticism of the guidelines set by the state, especially given the massive government investment in these fields. In the same speech he said he rejected any interpretation of his return to China as a patriotic act. Yuan Shuo, a guide specialized in lithic-era exhibits at the National Museum of China and very popular in the museum's interaction with public, had a televised public lecture in 2017. Titled H. Sapiens' March, he said \"every time I start the tour, I like to ask museum visitors: how does Peking Man relate to modern people? Everybody says he is our ancestor; we are the result of an evolution from him.\" Unfortunately, Yuan told his audience, there is a reproductive isolation between Peking Man and \"us,\" created by different biological mechanisms of the two species (Yuan 2017).",

            "text": "With regards to anthropologists, only a purely academic purpose has been claimed in response to queries, in particular those from foreign academics and journalists. As Wu Xinzhi put it, \"this has nothing to do with nationalism\" but is all about evidence, \"everything points to continuous evolution in China from H. erectus to modern humans,\" although \"they want everything to come from China\" is a kind of response from some foreign researchers (Qiu 2016) . Sautman argues that the work of Chinese anthropologists \"implies that hominids living in what is now China were 'Chinese' and urges that science should reinforce nationalism by showing an ancient Chinese pedigree\" (Sautman 2001, p. 103) . Acknowledging a nationalist agenda behind the Chinese anthropologists' argument, Schmalzer nonetheless maintains that such an argument is to \"defend their discipline's primary data set [i.e., fossils]\" and she also believes that \"Western ignorance about Chinese fossils\" contributes to the nationalist taint of the argument (Schmalzer 2008, p. 270) . While both are true, the discourse of anthropologists in recent years does read to be more suggestive of a lithic-age Chinese identity, which is more assertive than defensive. Without directly referring to nationalism or patriotism, it tends to manifest and transmit itself through a narrative of a set of distinctive attributes claimed to have been found in the entire geological epoch telescoping the eras of both H. erectus and H. sapiens. According to anthropologist Gao Xing in a 2010 IVPP annual research review, [A] ncient humans in China as well as East Asia had maintained continuity and stability in behaviour and technology throughout the entire Paleolithic and early Neolithic ages, developed a pattern of unique and gradual evolution with a characteristic of inheritance over innovation, and there had not been replacement and interruption. About 800,000 years ago, in southern and central China there appeared hand axes and other items similar to the contemporary Western 'Acheulian-technology' type, and about 30,000 years ago in northern China there appeared 'stone blade technology' with characteristics of later European Paleolithic culture, but they existed very isolated and transiently, like short-lived blossoms, and failed to leave any significant influence on native mainstream culture. Based on such evidence, scholars have suggested that the main group of ancient humans during the Pleistocene era in China and even in East Asia had continued to thrive, never experiencing any disruption, that its culture had powerful vigour for life and presented a successive evolutionary relationship; there were a small number of incidental foreign groups who had brought with them 'non-native' culture, but would soon disappear without any trace in the mainstream culture's dominance.",

Superior traits had sustained an archaic hominid group from H. erectus to H. sapiens over two million years of geological time, showing extraordinary talents and skills in making itself sovereign of the environment while indigenizing foreign influence. But exactly from where did this \"powerful vigor\" and those fine traits originate? Were they acquired through adaptation to the natural settings, a process in which contingent responses eventually led to structural reconfiguration and intuitive formation, or was it something more inborn? In the context of a strong nationalist tradition that tends to historicize national characteristics, such an evolutionary adaptability and success narrated in a triumphal tone naturally leads to a perception of an immutable and transhistorical Chineseness that arouses awe among its descendants. This argument for indigeneity and continuity of the lithic-age experience underlines an already clearly drawn trajectory of the development of prehistoric archaeology and ushers it into the discourse of Chinese civilization (Leibold 2012, pp. 343-348) . It facilitates an authoritative Chinese archeological claim in the new millennium for an essentially endogenous, self-perpetuating civilization, a phenomenon among the world's civilizations. In that claim, China is taken for granted as a prehistorical given, and there seems to be no need for restrictive clauses such as \"in what is today's China,\" as the spatial relationship between the past and the present is often so clarified by international scholars when necessary. Such a faithful confidence articulated in academic language had existed even in the early 1940s, as Li Guangming, one of the earliest ethnologists, incorporated paleoanthropological and archaeological findings with ancient historical text to delineate the continuity from Peking Man to the Zhou Dynasty (from the 11th century to the third century BCE): \"our race had been native long ago in prehistoric time, and it goes without saying that the later culture was also created by our native ancestors\" (Yen 2015, pp. 615-616) .",

In October 1988, Song Jian, the then State Counsellor, Chairman of the National Science and Technology Commission, and the party's Politburo member, visited Yunnan Provincial History Museum where some fossils (including a skull believed by some anthropologists belonging to H. erectus at the time) found in Yuanmou were displayed. In a letter written to the governor of Yunnan Province and the director of the museum upon his return to Beijing, Song said he was \"still in the mood of exhilaration aroused by that Ramapithecus skull.\" He told them he had just received a copy of National Geographic from America, which was a special issue on the origin of modern humans. Song said he looked for Yuanmou on the map titled \"The Peopling of the Earth\" in the issue but it wasn't there, although Liujiang Man (sixty-seven thousand years old and from the Paleolithic era) and Peking Man were included. \"The author says our ancestors are all immigrants from Africa! But if we show them Yuanmou Ramapithecus of more than three million years old, this illustration will be completely cast off!\" Song urged for more propaganda efforts to make Yuanmou Man known in the world to \"give those undereducated but arrogant Americans a good education.\" At the end of the letter Song asked to circulate the map in National Geographic (Song 1988 ).",

            "text": "For scholars of early Chinese history, Song's profound interest in Chinese antiquity and his role in promoting relevant research are an example of state patronage of discussions on national origin. Song is known for his role in the state-sponsored efforts to establish a credible chronology for Xia, Shang, and Zhou, the three earliest Chinese dynasties. Traditional Chinese historical chronology only recognized the year 841 BCE as the beginning of the documented history of China, established in Sima Qian's (the first and most influential figure in Chinese historiography, who lived from the second to the first century, BCE) Shi Ji (The Grand History ) . This year falls in the middle of the Zhou dynasty. Despite the fact that the existence of Xia and Shang as Chinese states predating Zhou had been generally accepted by historians, the specific dates of Xia, Shang, and the starting date of Zhou had remained undetermined with a very vague estimate of the twenty-third century BCE for Xia. During a state visit to Egypt, where the chronology of ancient civilization is documented with specific dates, Song was impressed and felt an urgency to do the same for Chinese history, a civilization believed to be comparable to Egypt in its antiquity. Song campaigned for an interdisciplinary effort to determine the earliest dates of those dynasties and secured millions of Chinese yuan in funding. Named the Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasty Chronology Project, it was completed and preliminary results were produced around 2000, which pushed back the credible time table for Chinese history to some eight hundred years earlier than that determined by Sima Qian (Song 2009 ). Yuanmou Man's ancestorship has also become a battleground between COC and AOC scholars since 2000. In 2005, an international conference held in Yuanmou hosted by the provincial government and under the guidance of COC academics (it was presented by Wu Xinzhi) to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the discovery of the two teeth. While all the participants including the deputy governor of the province made it clear that Yuanmou Man is undoubtedly the earliest human species and the ancestor of Chinese people, Su Bin presented his paper titled \"The Genetic Study of the Origin of Modern East Asian Humans and Their Migration,\" using DNA data to inform conference participants of the AOC theory. His discordant voice was submerged by \"categorical\" repudiations from \"all experts at the conference\" .",

Yuanmou is one of the poorest counties in Yunnan province and the provincial and county governments have proposed several projects to attract not only tourists, but also investors.

Li, a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee and the Chairman of the Central Spiritual Civilization Steering Committee (both 2002-2012) , published an article under his pen name of Yong Chun in the Guangming Daily in 2012. Li's article was a result of his inspection tour to Nihewan (Yangyuan County, Hebei Province), a site of some of the earliest Paleolithic remains found in China. Before Li's visit, Liu Yunshan, the minister of the DPCCP and a member of Politburo, had visited the site and emphasized its importance for nationalist education, believing that the site shows how ancient human evolved in the \"East.\" (Wang, X. 2014. P. 214) With the title \"Some Philosophical Thoughts Regarding Human Evolution,\" Li started with a short explanation of the multiregional and Out-of-Africa theories regarding the origin of humans, and acknowledged the latter as the current mainstream theory. Li claims that he \"knows nothing about archaeology nor anthropology,\" but following Marxist dialectical materialism, Darwin's natural selection, and especially Lamarckian use and disuse theories, he stated his belief in the multiregional theory and strenuously argued for an evolutionarily most advanced status for the Chinese based on his analytical comparisons of the physical characteristics of the world's races. He started with an answer to the question of why the Chinese are less hairy. Early anthropoids had thick and dense hair to keep their naked bodies warm, but as they became more civilized, they came to be aware of the shame of their nudity so they began to use animal furs and tree bark and eventually textiles to cover their bodies. As a result, the function of the body being kept warm by hairs was replaced and led to its gradual loss, Therefore we can come to the conclusion that the race of the least hairy is the race of the evolutionarily most advanced. Among modern humans, white people are the most hairy, blacks next, followed by brown people, yellow people the least, and the Chinese with the least of the least. So, the Chinese must have been the racial group [\u79cd\u7fa4] that started human evolution earlier than the others. Of course, there are some groups in China who are more hairy [than others], that is perhaps the result of racial mixing.",

He said that from crawling to upright standing and walking, the bone structure of the human body underwent a directional change of ninety degrees, which altered the direction of force of the central bones to enable the buttock and hip bones to evolve more inwardly rather than bulging outwards. This change enabled the human body to stand upright on two legs, unlike animals that walk on four limbs. Li continued, So we can come to the conclusion that [among human races] the less protruding the buttock, the earlier upright walking started. Compared with other races, the Chinese buttock is flatter. Therefore, the Chinese must have belonged to the race that started upright walking earlier [than other races].",

As anthropoids came down to the ground and used tools to work, their forelimbs were released from making heavy physical movements resulting in degenerated and shorter forelimbs. His conclusion is that the human race groups whose forelimbs are shorter started evolution earlier than those whose forelimbs are longer. Modern human's forelimbs are in general shorter than their hind legs, but different races exhibit different proportions. Then he ranked racial groups based on a comparison of the lengths of their forelimbs and hind legs, \"The lengths of forelimbs and hind legs of black and brown races are the closest, the white race is next, and the yellow race is the least close. Therefore, the Chinese must have been the racial group that abandoned living in trees before the others did.\"",

As evolution developed, humans gradually learned to use language to exchange information, and the primitive function of glands gradually degenerated with the olfactory grand being a typical example, Therefore, we can come to the conclusion that, as far as the olfactory gland [among different race groups] is concerned, the less remaining, the earlier the evolution. According to some data, among the Han Chinese, only about 4% of them have armpit sniffing, while the percentage is much higher among Westerners and Africans. So, the degeneration of the olfactory gland among the Chinese started much earlier and progressed further than it did among the other races.",

Li referred to the Chinese phrase of \"eating meat with hairs and blood\" (\u8339\u6bdb\u996e\u8840). Li believed that is why the Chinese cannot eat more raw, cold, and hard food, because their stomach function has degenerated as the result of their more civilized way of eating. He continued to discuss the evolutionary changes that happened to the mouth. Because cooked food was more processed, the number of teeth were reduced and the shape of the mouth became flatter. \"Compared with other races, the mouth of the Chinese is flatter.

            "text": "Chinese AOC scientists also interpret racial differences between East Asians and human groups elsewhere by biological traits formed through evolution. In a very recent interview, Li Hui, one of Jin Li's colleagues and director of the Key Laboratory of Modern Anthropology at Fudan University, said that in 2013 Jin Li and his team collaborated with scientists from Harvard University and discovered a gene mutation that at a critical time influenced the evolution of human races. Li said, \"the ancestors of our East Asian peoples entered the land of Zhonghua [today's China] from Yunnan [China's southernmost province] and they were the descendants of prehistorical human groups in West Asia. Perhaps in order to adapt to the then hot and humid climate there, a radical mutation happened in their body's EDARI [a type of gene unit]. It is an important gene that controls ectoderm.\" Li explained that this mutation in EDARI not only led to changes in the shape and color of hair, which later characterize East Asians, but also differentiated East Asians from Europeans in terms of perspiration. The skin tissue (determined by EDARI) of East Asians enables them to radiate body heat more through sweating, therefore East Asians often sweat more than West Asians and Europeans do. Li went further, suggesting that the result of this gene mutation can be used to explain why Westerners like to drink cold or even ice water even in winter, partly because cold water can directly lower their body temperature while East Asians like to drink hot water, regardless of the season, because it helps them to sweat. He said that when East Asians have a fever, as long as it is not very high, they can lie down and cover their body with a heavy quilt to force themselves to sweat-sweating helps lower body temperaturebut this practice doesn't work for Westerners. Li believed that this is the reason for today's \"precision treatment,\" a treatment considering human genetic differences and rejecting a standard or indiscriminate treatment for all types of peoples . While Li's explanations cannot answer the question of why many or even most East Asians who grew up in America also drink cold or even ice water in all seasons, and therefore drinking hot or cold drinks might be just a habit formed in different cultures, his interpretations regarding the consequences of gene mutation in hair and skin color as well as skin tissue do not convey any implications of a more advanced evolutionary stage. Rather, they merely describe different evolutionary results determined by natural circumstances, rather than being shaped by the species' conscious and goal-oriented efforts. Also, his interpretation does not suggest a relationship between the evolutionary characteristics of the species and its social and cultural traits. More importantly, in the same interview, Li stated, \"the Chinese civilization did not begin to appear until 12,000 years ago when the last Ice Age ended, the climate began to turn warm, and agriculture started to develop.\" Therefore the evolutionary results of explaining racial differences are not read from an apparently cultural and social perspective for the purpose of constructing a unique national character and attesting to its advanced status in the human evolutionary process.",

Why is there such a remarkable resemblance between racial discourses almost a century apart embraced by intellectual and political elites regarding the evidence of and belief in the evolutionary advancement of the Chinese, yet their political ideologies are so distinctively different? Why did Li adhere so single mindedly and naturally to Lamarckian theory, as he understood and interpreted it, while showing no knowledge at all of other theories, and why did he come so close to those racial theories-without knowing them-in arguing for an evolutionary superiority of a particular present-day race?

Mao, in pursuit of his ideological agenda to justify constant political purges under his regime and within his party, argued that even in socialist society there would be capitalists and class enemies constantly engendered from within and which needed to be periodically identified and eliminated. He could find nothing in Marxist theories to support this argument, therefore he turned to physics where although more elementary particles were being identified, scientists were not sure if such a divisibility would go on indefinitely. Mao jumped into the discussion and claimed his faith in indefinite divisibility and made it clear that it was the scientific foundation for his theory of continued revolution under socialism. His political theory complied with cosmological principles that claimed contradictions and oppositions were universal and permanent in the physical world. It was because of Mao's interest and faith in this indefinite divisibility that the Chinese state lavishly sponsored elementary particle research in the 1960s in the hope of establishing a \"Chinese school\" of elementary particle physics (Cheng 2006) . Today, the Chinese state's attitude towards the debate between the AOC and COC theories and its supporters bears a resemblance to Mao's treatment of elementary particle physics and the then government's support of the science. Song and Li's confidence in the COC theory and an uncontested antiquity of Chinese civilization reads like Mao proclaiming his faith in the indefinite divisibility of matter to scientists and party leaders: \"Do you believe it? Whether or not you believe it, I do anyway\" (Cheng 2006, p. 113) . What buttresses their confidence in a science to which they are laymen are political and ideological agendas: in the past, it was Mao's political purges under the party-state, and today it is nationalism that legitimates the party-state. Mao appealed to a hypothetical scientific theory, and his successors a racial science. Their political power grants to them a discourse hegemony in the sciences.",

As Wang Xitong, the archeologist who was in charge of the Nihewan project, stated that Liu and Li not only made inspection tours to the archeological site in the same year, specifically stressed its value in \"seeking roots regarding human evolution in the East\" as part of a \"state project\", but also promised substantial government budget for the site (Wang X. 2014. p. 214 ). An academic conference was quickly convened following their inspection tours. The link between the debate on human origins and nationalist politics at the highest level is undeniable. Finally, the superiority of the Chinese race has been so explicitly articulated by Li's meticulous attention paid to the would-be evolutionary advancement bestowed on the Chinese, that it is reminiscent of those scientific racial theories of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",

The other shows a man capped and dressed in a typical Chinese aristocratic dress style against a background of various scenes of civilized society. Below this image a Chinese phrase \"barbarians\" (\u86ee\u5937) appears. On the left of the cartoon are lines of Chinese characters in a large font: \"The great H. erectus two million years [ago]; Son of Heaven defends the entrance of his cave; The king would die in the jungles [rather than surrender to a more civilized life?]; No territorial concessions (\u5272\u5730) and no war reparations (\u8d54\u6b3e); No marriage for peace making (\u548c\u4eb2) and no tribute paying (\u7eb3\u8d21).\" A probable encounter between H. erectus (Chinese) and H. sapiens (foreigners) is portrayed as a Stone-Age skirmish between foreign invaders and national defenders.

As bizarre as it may seem, the cartoon interprets with an intense feeling the debate between the AOC and COC theories as a transhistorical defense of the Chinese against the foreign at all costs, even a more civilized way of life, a reminder of Chinese anthropologists' argument that had Chinese H. sapiens been foreign in origin, then archaeologists would have been able to find more developed tools (Hupu 2009 ).

But scientists have recently told us: we actually came from afar\" (Huang 2008) . Yang Jintao, an editor and popular history author for the History Channel (one of the top web portals), wrote an article about changes in perceptions of \"our ancestor\" since the late nineteenth century. He told the reader that for quite a while many late Qing and early Republican conservative intellectuals, including Liu Shipei and Zhang Taiyan (two influential anti-Qing scholars who aspired to a great Han nation), embraced a hypothesis of a Western origin for the Chinese created by Terrien de Lacouperie, a nineteenth century French orientalist. According to Lacouperie, the ancestors of the Chinese are the Babylonians. These intellectuals were fascinated by this Western-created theory of a Western origin for the Chinese, a seeming contradiction given their staunch cultural conservatism because it boosted their ethnic and racial confidence: we were descendants of the white race while the ruling Manchu were barbarians. Now, the Chinese believe that their ancestor is independent and native. Leaving the answer to the question of the AOC vs. the COC to further scientific research, Yang nonetheless suggested that changes in the perception of ancestorship reflect a change of national mentality that resulted from different circumstances of Chinese nationalism: \"in the late Qing, people built up their [national] confidence through seeking evidence for their Western origin, but today they hope to prove an independent origin of the Chinese\" .",

To promote Peking Man's archaeological site as a base for national patriotic education and commemorate those Chinese anthropologists as patriotic heroes purposefully ignores the internationalist spirit of those foreign scientists who committed themselves to Chinese archaeology and anthropology, as well as China's international prominence in these fields. Davidson Black, the leading anthropologist and chief administrator of the Zhoukoudian site in the early 1930s from whom Peking Man took its name, was so devoted to the job that he ignored the heart condition he was born with and died on site while working on the fossils (Jia 1990, p. 1) . Despite the profound gratitude Chinese anthropologists hold for these foreigners, the official narrative of Peking Man, whenever unavoidable, refers to these foreigners' contributions as scientific but rarely internationalist.

Nevertheless, technical difficulties and uncertainties unsolved by the discourse aside, especially regarding how to identify Jews (who is and who is not) under different historical circumstances, Abu El-Haj argues that DNA analysis cannot be directly converted into an identity construct. The barrier between historically formed human consciousness and human bodily facts is epistemological. Abu El-Haj effectively shows how the Israeli discourse has played with genetic data, leaving behind unanswered questions reflecting ambiguity, elusiveness, and an ever-shifting emphasis caused by ignoring such a barrier. Her analysis on the problematic use of genetics in Israeli nationalism therefore provides a comparative perspective as well as a methodological tool in the critique of the use of paleoanthropological science by Chinese nationalism (Abu El-Haj 2012).",

As the dating of the findings kept rolling back from fifty thousand years to five hundred thousand years ago, the biological sketch of an H. erectus Japanese Man became clearer with each excavation. This Japanese Man not only distanced Japan from Korea (like in Japan before Shinichi's \"findings,\" the earliest traces of human activity found in Korea were from no earlier than thirty thousand years ago) but also enabled the nation to compete with China, the regional big brother in the field of human evolution. Japanese Man therefore claimed for the nation a prominent place in the history of human evolution. Much more than that, this Japanese Man was portrayed by authoritative scholars and media as \"uncommonly intelligent,\" \"capable of building tombs, using colors to differentiate between tools, even performing math,\" and appeared to have had some sense of spirituality (French 2000) . Japanese Man stood to challenge conventional thinking about the intellectual and mental faculty of H. erectus for almost two decades in which the nation was plunged into an archeological fever centered on Fujimura, until it was debunked in around 2000 as all of these findings were found to be forgeries secretly buried in advance by Fujimura himself. He was called \"God's Hand\" because of his miraculous series of successes in identifying sites of artifacts. After his \"discovery\" was debunked, the age of Japanese Man in human evolution was set back to the previously acknowledged date of no more than thirty thousand years ago (Romey 2000) .",

No human fossils were found, only tools and some material culture remains were found, and all the discoveries were made by Fujimura and his team. There was a distinct lack of cross-examination of artefacts by rigorous peer reviews, and contemporary scientific dating and authentication methods. Why was such a charlatan able to fool Japanese academia and society so quickly, so easily, and for so long (fortunately the international anthropological community never took Japanese Man seriously)? Immediately after the debunking, international media pointed out the source of the decades-long national fever of archaeology, \"For a nation that has always revelled in its cultural uniqueness, the discoveries were more than heartening; they were almost too good to be true. They meant that Japan was settled more than half a million years ago, which put it on a par in the antiquity scales with its perennial rival, China\" (French 2000) .",

It is noteworthy that the scientific scandal came at the time when Japanese nationalism, especially its right wing, was on the rise as national confidence was regained after two decades of post-war economic miracles that amazed the world. 11 Wu argued that the Fujimura fraud \"was indeed a conspiracy involving government agencies, regional governments, the media, and academia\u2026 Through textbooks, museums, and designated cultural assets, the officials of the central government used Fujimura's findings to enhance national pride and cultural nationalism. Regional governments strove to promote local identity and tourism\" (Ng 2010, p. 104) . The last point, that local government exploited the tourist value of Japanese Man, was similar to the one behind the promotion of Peking Man and Yuanmou Man in China, but such a mundane motive only testifies to a new, consumerist form of discourses of race.",

            "text": "By comparison, Piltdown Man is still an anthropological species but Japanese Man is a national ancestor that directly led to the rewriting of the history of the origin of Japanese people and civilization. The difference lies in the fact that the former is just human fossils while all the evidence for the latter showed the creature's intelligence and craft adaptable to the environment and its aesthetic preference and spiritual desire. All of these traits were connected to the characteristics of Japanese civilization. In fact Japanese school history textbooks-especially ones used in the region where Japanese Man was \"found\"-had included the \"discovery\" and its interpretation. The absence of human fossils in this case makes the illusive Japanese Man even more intriguing, just as a Japanese puppet show-the man hidden behind the puppet only revealing himself through the pulling of the strings that manipulate the actions of the puppet to gain the audience's admiration. When a direct link between the half a million-year-old ancestor and today's Japanese is established, a scientifically endorsed sense of superiority in human evolution reinforces the myth-based belief in the uniqueness and purity of the people. It is this link that lends racial implications to the nationalist agenda of Japanese Man.",

Huang Weiwen, a paleoanthropologist at the IVPP and an ardent supporter of Yuanmou Man's status as the ancestor of the Chinese people, visited the archaeological sites in Miyagi prefecture before the scandal was debunked. His remarks not only agreed with Fujimura's discoveries but also showed a sign of the possible collaboration between Chinese COC scholars and those Japanese anthropologists in search of an independent East Asian origin of modern humans. As he put it, \"the progresses of the Chinese research and the Japanese research are like two wheels of a vehicle. We can expect that the chronology [of human evolution] based on the African-origin theory will certainly be changed in near future\" (Ng 2010, p. 91 ). Huang is a very active researcher and popular science writer. Following a suggestion by Japanese scholars, his book on Peking Man (published in 2005, after Japanese Man was debunked) is titled Peking Original Man (\u5317\u4eac\u539f\u4eba) instead of the common Peking Man (\u5317\u4eac\u733f\u4eba). The pronunciations of \u5317\u4eac\u539f\u4eba and \u5317\u4eac\u733f\u4eba are precisely the same in the Chinese language, but the former renders the meaning of the \"original man of Beijing,\" thus indicating the status of ancestor and lineage while the latter literarily means \"the ape man of Beijing.\" Interestingly, Japanese Man also literarily meant \"Japanese Original Man\" in the Japanese language as well (translated into Chinese as \u65e5\u672c\u539f\u4eba) when it was believed to be true (Huang 2002) .",

            "text": "Although \"regarded as illegitimate in our time,\" as Benjamin Isaac cautions, racism \"occurs under different names and in different guises\" (Isaac2009, p. 4). However, the political appropriation of the COC theory shows that some classical and prototypical racial thinking persists with little alteration. Among recent discussants of racial nationalism and the myth of a unique ancestor, Maurice Olender reveals \"a nostalgia for old Aryanistic themes\" in Nouvelle \u00c9cole (New School), a French school of classics, in recent decades, which can also provide a comparative perspective. Despite the notoriety of Nazi propaganda regarding the Aryan race, the Nouvelle \u00c9cole attributes to the origin of Western European civilization a \"perfect Aryan genius\" of the \"Indo-Europeans\" since the Neolithic era, manifested in such traits as \"abstraction and metaphysics,\" \"reflection,\" and particularly \"a constant tendency to subordinate the natural by integrating it into the political\" (Olender 2009, pp. 47, 68) . A moral portrait of such a creature is also implied. These echo the Chinese discourse of ancestral genius, implied in the comprehensive behavior model, and praise of ancestral valor and virtue in anthropological and artistic languages. On the national ideological spectrum, many Nouvelle \u00c9cole scholars were leaning towards \"various currents of the 'New Right'.\" In China the most outspoken COC lay supporters are ultra-nationalists for whom defending a purely indigenous origin is a political cause. For Olender, the Nouvelle \u00c9cole discourse represented efforts to rehabilitate Homo europaeus (Olender 2009, p. 55) , a discredited racial concept that portrayed a presumed superior human stock with a unique social character derived from biological traits. Similar efforts to essentialize and mystify particular human groups can also be found in the discourse about Homo alpinus, a Swiss alpine peasant myth of \"a strong, healthy, hardworking, patient, perseverant, good natured but autonomous human type\" (Sommer 2012, p. 120) . Abu El-Haj also dubs the Israeli construct of a pure-blood and single-ancestor Jewishness Homo israelensis (Abu EI-Haj 2012, pp. 99-108). While these discourses involve a relatively recent time in which human civilizations had begun, the Chinese discourse dates back at least half a million years, sunken deep into pre-human natural history. \"Homo sinensis,\" a term invented by this author to refer to the parallel is therefore more of a legitimate name for the assumed prehistorical and transhistorical human stock with a more biological than cultural connotation.",

It is a neoracial rhetoric rooted in modern China's nationalist tradition and has collaborated with the racial discourse expressed in the popular music analyzed in the previous chapter. To conclude, Peking Man's ancestorship facilitates the national identity politics in China's rise and a racialized Chineseness as a most cohesive force. Anthony Smith's concise analysis on archaeology's role in legitimating the ethnic nation is a ready tool for a brief final analysis. All concepts in favor of \"the nationalist ideal of the distinctive, territorial nation\" backed up by archaeology's presentation of the material culture of the past such as uniqueness, essentialism, rootedness, authenticity, indigeneity, or more tangibly, soil, lead to a construction of the \"historical homeland\" (Smith 2001) . The political appropriation of the COC theory has extended the application of these concepts from the ethnic/cultural (measured in thousands of years) to the evolutionary/biological (measured in hundreds of thousands of years). Cultural continuity has been transformed into racial genealogy. A Chinese identity finds its ultimate origin not only in an H. erectus ancestry but also in an asserted harmony between this hominid and the natural setting. The two fuse into a habitat alien to foreigners from which \"motherland/fatherland\" (the land is ancestrally \"ours\") and \"Chinese territory since antiquity\" acquire absolute legitimacy. In the final analysis, a racial myth of a million-year-old exuberant bioenergy, called the \"vigorous vitality and incomparable creativity,\" as the current Chinese President reiterated, has become a catchphrase that distinguishes the superior Chinese from Others (Xi 2014) .",
