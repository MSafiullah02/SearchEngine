Safety; and 5. Equity.2.\nAt the Meso level of organizations, the quality of care and the definitions are more focused, the dimensions include: 1. Effectiveness of care; 2. Compliance with clinical guidelines; 3. Patient-related quality (e.g., quality of life, patient satisfaction); and 4. Organizational Quality (e.g., safety, rate of re-hospitalization, average length of stay). The quality of care can also be defined in relation to specific technologies, such as care management practices.3.The Micro level includes 1. Measures related to patients (quality of life, patient satisfaction); and 2. Providers (job satisfaction).\n",
