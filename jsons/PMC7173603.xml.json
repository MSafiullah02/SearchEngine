In this context, cost-effective, sustainable, and eco-friendly polymeric materials derived from renewable resources that can replace those based on petroleum feedstock are being sought. Even after the recent expansion of renewable polymers, the small contribution of renewable polymers in the commercial market is mostly due to their elevated cost and poorer performance compared with synthetic polymers produced from petroleum chemicals [1]. The leading challenge for the biorenewable industry is to prepare materials with properties that counterpart those of petroleum-based ones so that they can compete or even surpass the chemicals now in use. The most-employed renewable resources are plant oils, polysaccharides, and proteins.",

The major constituents of plant oils are triglycerides, which are the product of esterification of glycerol with three fatty acids. Fatty acids account for 95% of the total weight of triglycerides, and their composition varies depending on the plant, crop, season, growing conditions, and purification methods [3], and their properties are conditioned by the stereochemistry of the double bonds, the degree of unsaturation and the length of fatty acids. The chemical structures of the most common fatty acids of vegetable oils are depicted in Fig. 19.1\n.\n",

A number of derivatives of vegetable oils have been employed as polymerizable monomers in radiation-curable systems to provide flexible and tough resins like epoxy, urethane, and polyester [6]. Amine-cured combinations of epoxidized soybean oil and conventional epoxy resins, acrylated soybean oil copolymerized with styrene and divinylbenzene, and polyurethane resins prepared from polyols derived from castor oil have been widely used to prepare composite materials with excellent mechanical and barrier properties [7]. Further, epoxidized vegetable oils (EVO) such as soybean and palm have been used in UV-curable coating systems [5], [6]. While the use of vegetable oils in paints and coatings is decades old, nowadays emphasis is being made on this type of materials to bring in new properties, improved performance coupled with environment friendliness at affordable costs [8]. It is expected that vegetable oil\u2013based coating will compete in the next future with their petro-based counterparts in performance and applications and may establish themselves as \u201cgreener\u201d precursors to environment friendly coatings.",

This oil is beneficial for the human body and can prevent heart attack since it is the richest source of \u03b1-linolenic acid. It also contains lignans that may have antioxidant actions and aid to protect against certain cancers. In addition, it helps to prevent elevated blood pressure by inhibiting inflammatory reactions that cause artery-hardening plaque and poor circulation. About 70% of all the LO produced worldwide is intended for technical applications, and the rest is for food production. Its typical fatty acid composition is shown in Fig. 19.2\n. The low cost, sustainability, availability, and ease of handling of LO make it attractive as an alternative to petroleum-based plastics. Consequently, it has previously been employed as raw material for the synthesis of biopolymers [10] as well as in paints and coatings, and it is starting to be used in agriculture, food packaging, and biomedicine. In this regard, the antibacterial activity of LO against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Candida albicans has been recently reported [11].\n",

To overcome these shortcomings, with a view to expand their range of commercial uses, new approaches are required such as blending with other polymers [12] or filling with nanofillers [13], [14], [15], [16].

One of the leading applications of photocatalytic coatings, including TiO2 particles, is to avoid microbial growth or, at least, decrease the amount of microorganisms that proliferate on indoor building materials [18]. Indoor air pollution is a severe public health concern and a major reason for mortality worldwide. The presence of microbial populations in humid indoor environments is one of the main causes of the sick building syndrome [19]. Further, a direct correlation between mold growth and respiratory diseases for people who occupy damp or water-damaged buildings has been found [20]. Microorganisms can produce contaminants like allergens or toxins that cause health problems to occupants such as allergic reactions, respiratory infections, asthma, pneumonitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and so forth.",

AELO was synthesized from the EVO using acrylic acid as ring opening agent, triethylamine (TEA) as a catalyst, and hydroquinone as a free radical inhibitor, subsequently cross-linked and subjected to UV irradiation to get the cured nanocomposites. Their morphology, barrier, thermal, mechanical, tribological, and antibacterial properties have been analyzed through a variety of techniques. The following sections will describe in detail the influence of the nanoparticle concentration on the different properties. These antimicrobial nanocomposites are suitable for the surface coating industry. Thus, they can be applied to frequently touched objects in public places such as hospitals, schools, restaurants, public transportation, etc. More importantly, they can be appropriate as coatings for hospital countertops, beds, and general medical tools, and in particular, in operating rooms where it is easier to acquire a contagion. Even though decontamination and disinfection of surfaces using chemicals is a frequent practice to avoid spread of diseases, such protocols are sometimes skipped or not practicable. Therefore, these nanocomposite coatings could be very useful to prevent bacterial infection in public places.",

In addition, two high-pressure forms, TiO2 (II) with a PbO2 structure and TiO2 (H) with a hollandite structure have been synthesized from the rutile phase. Anatase TiO2 has a tetragonal structure (Fig. 19.3A\n) and encloses six atoms per unit cell, albeit the TiO6 octahedron is distorted. The anatase phase predominates at 0 K; this structure is ideal for solar cell applications due to higher electron mobility, higher specific area, lower dielectric constant, and density. Rutile TiO2 also has a tetragonal structure (Fig. 19.3B) and the octahedron is less distorted. It is stable at most temperatures and pressures up to 60 kbar. Anatase and brookite structures transform to the rutile phase for particle sizes >14 nm. It is mainly used as white pigment in paint. Brookite TiO2 belongs to the orthorhombic crystal system (Fig. 19.3C). Its unit cell comprises eight formula units of TiO2 and is formed by edge-sharing TiO6 octahedra.",

A variety of synthesis methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol\u2013gel, direct oxidation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrodeposition, sonochemical, mechanochemical, and microwave method have been used for the preparation of TiO2 nanostructures [29]. Among them, the most employed are the sol\u2013gel and the hydrothermal method. The former process involves conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution (sol) that acts as the precursor for the discrete particles. This process normally proceeds via an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis step of titanium (IV) alkoxide followed by condensation. The latter does not necessitate the use of organic solvents or further processing of the product (grinding and calcination), which makes it a straightforward and environmentally friendly technique. The synthesis occurs in an autoclave, where the mixture of substrates is heated steadily to a temperature of 100\u2013300\u00b0C and is kept for several days. This process leads to products of high degree of crystallinity and high purity. The mechanochemical process is an inexpensive and easy method of obtaining TiO2 nanoparticles on a large scale [30]. It employs titanyl sulfate (TiOSO4\u00b7xH2SO4\u00b7yH2O) as starting material and requires high-energy dry milling that starts a reaction through ball\u2013powder impact in a ball mill at low temperature. A \u201cthinner\u201d is added to the system in the form of a solid (usually NaCl), which acts as a reaction medium and separates the nanoparticles being formed. The advantages of this technique are the high homogeneity of the crystalline structure and morphology, low production costs, small particle sizes, and restricted tendency of the particles to agglomerate. A shortcoming of this method is that it requires long milling times to attain a uniform grinding of the powder, which leads to a greater amount of impurities.",

In the microwave heating, the solution is heated using microwaves at 90\u00b0C for a few minutes. The precipitate obtained is then centrifuged, washed with water and ethanol, and finally dried.

They are semiconductors with a structurally dependent band gap (anatase\u20143.20 eV and rutile\u20143.03 eV), widely used for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications. In particular, they are very effective in photocatalytic water splitting and have been employed as active layers in photovoltaics as well as electrodes in photoelectrolysis cells where they have been shown to enhance the efficiency of electrolytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen [33]. These environmentally friendly materials also display intense UV absorption, large volume to area ratio, high catalytic activity, highly crystalline structure, radiation hardness, density of \u223c4 g/cm3, melting point of 2100 K, good mechanical properties including a Young's modulus of 230 GPa and hardness of \u223c10 GPa, low coefficient of thermal expansion (\u223c8.4 \u00d7 10\u22126\n K\u22121 at 300 K), low dielectric constant (\u223c10), and high thermal conductivity (\u223c4.8 W/cm K). They also display antimicrobial activity against a large variety of microorganisms, including algae, viruses, protozoa, fungi, and bacteria like Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Lactobacillus acidophilus and E. coli (bacteria), and Chlorella vulgaris (green algae). When TiO2 is illuminated with UV light, electron (e\u2212)/hole (h+) pairs are generated that have strong reducing and oxidizing power. These react with O2 and H2O to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion radicals (O2\u2212) and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) (Fig. 19.4\n), which are regarded the dominant species contributing to the destruction of microorganism cells [34]. The hydroxyl radical is an extremely aggressive oxidant, and as such, it can attack various biological molecules and impair their proper functioning.\n",

It has been reported that cell wall damage precedes cytoplasmic membrane damage [36], thereby leading to leakage of minerals, proteins, and genetic materials, causing cell death. For instance, cell membrane damage took place due to the photocatalytic degradation of endotoxin from E. coli with TiO2 thin films [36]. Further, it has been demonstrated that the rate of adsorption of cells onto TiO2 is directly related to its bactericidal effect [37]. Adsorption of cells onto aggregated TiO2, followed by loss of membrane integrity, was the reason of the bactericidal effect. Another explanation of the antimicrobial action is the release of Ti2+ ions that bind to the membrane of the microorganisms.",

As depicted in Fig. 19.6A\nfor AELO/TiO2 (7.5 wt%) nanocomposite, the coatings are uniform without detectable cracks. Brilliant spherical dots well dispersed inside the AELO matrix can be observed, which correspond to the TiO2 nanoparticles that have an average diameter of 40 nm. They are mostly individually dispersed, albeit some small clusters comprising a few nanoparticles are also found. Similar morphology was found for the rest of nanocomposites [41]. The H-bonding and polar interactions between the OH groups of TiO2 surface and the polar groups of AELO prevent the formation of nanoparticle aggregates. Hence, good dispersion of TiO2 was achieved without the need for particle surface treatments or compatibilizing agents, which makes the fabrication of these nanocomposites easier, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly. The EDAX spectrum of the nanocomposite (Fig. 19.6B) corroborates that the sample contains Ti, C, N, and O elements, thus confirming the presence of the nanoparticles entrapped within the epoxidized network.",

AELO is thermally stable up to \u223c300\u00b0C, and exhibits two decomposition steps too; the first attributed to the loss of functional groups and the second to the degradation of the epoxy chains. Similar thermogram is found for the nanocomposites, suggesting that the degradation mechanism of AELO remains unchanged in the presence of TiO2, although the curves are upshifted. As can be observed in Fig. 19.7B, the initial degradation temperature (measured at 2% weight loss) and the temperatures of maximum rate decomposition (Tmax1 and Tmax2 referring to the first and second degradation stages) increase with increasing TiO2 content, by up to 30, 27, and 34\u00b0C, respectively, for the AELO/TiO2 (7.5 wt%) nanocomposite.

These results indicate superior barrier properties to gases for the nanocomposite coatings compared to neat AELO. Previous studies have also reported reduced WVP in epoxy/TiO2 nanocomposites [44]. Other researchers have also shown positive effects of TiO2 nanoparticles on WVP of epoxy-based nanocomposites [31].

In this regard, the tribological performance of the nanocomposite coatings was evaluated at room temperature with a pin-on-disc tribometer under a load of 1 N, with a 6-mm diameter 100Cr6 steel ball as counterpart [41]. The results for the coefficient of friction (\u03bc) and the specific wear rate (W\nsp) of the nanocomposite coatings are plotted in Fig. 19.10B. \u03bc decreases gradually with TiO2 content, by about 57%, for the nanocomposite with 5.0 wt% concentration that correlates with the utmost hardness. The trend observed is related to various aspects, namely the enhancement in mechanical properties, the strong nanofiller\u2013matrix interfacial adhesion, the uniformly dispersed nanoparticles that decrease the free volume, and the elevated thermal conductivity of TiO2 that reduces the temperature in the sliding contact.",

Such rolling mechanism was also described for epoxy/TiO2 nanocomposites [49], and it was reported that TiO2 not only behaved as a load carrier but also favored the bonding between the transfer film and the countersurface.

As mentioned earlier, the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection is related to the oxidative damage mostly provoked by ROS including O2\n\u2212, HO2, and HO radicals. OH radicals are supposed to be the major cause of the bactericidal effect [53], although some investigations attributed the antimicrobial action to the direct oxidation by \u201choles\u201d from the valence band on the TiO2 surface [54], [55]. It has been proposed that initially ROS harm the outer membrane, and later damage the cytoplasmic membrane, implicated in the cellular respiration, hence the cell dies. The differences found between the two bacteria tested should be connected to structural and chemical differences of the cell surfaces. The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria comprises a thick, complex peptidoglycan sheath outside of the cytoplasmic membrane composed of peptidoglycan, teichuronic acids and lipoteichoic acids (Fig. 19.12A\n), while that of gram-negative microorganisms comprises an outer membrane connected to a thin single peptidoglycan film placed between the outer and inner membranes that contains lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins and provides a permeability barrier of small hydrophilic molecules across the membrane (Fig. 19.12B). The outer membrane offers resistance to a number of substances, reducing the harm from ROS.",
