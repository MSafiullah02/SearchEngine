Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK)-cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection 1-3 , implying that NK cells have a role in these T-cellassociated diseases. Although direct NK-cell-mediated lysis of virusinfected cells may contribute to antiviral defence during some virus infections-especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans 4,5 -NK cells have also been suspected of having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T-cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells 6, 7 . In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems to be resistant to any direct antiviral effects of NK cells 5, 8 .",

We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus doses, NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at medium doses NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T-cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T-cell-mediated support for the antiviral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.",

In contrast, there was a substantial loss of activated donor CD4 T cells in infected relative to uninfected recipients, and this loss was prevented by depletion of NK cells (Fig. 4a) . The magnitude of NK-cell-dependent loss of activated donor CD4 T cells was similar in low-, medium-and highdose-infected recipients (Fig. 4b ). More activated CD4 T cells, both donor and host derived, in infected (control) mice stained positively for the apoptosis indicator annexin V in comparison to naive donor CD4 T cells or to activated donor CD4 T cells in medium-doseinfected DNK recipient mice (Fig. 4c) .

Of note is that we did not observe the expression of ligands for activating NK-cell receptors including NKG2D, NKp46 (also known as NCR1), DNAM-1 (also known as CD226) and TRAIL (also known as TNFSF10) on these early activated CD4 T cells, and NK-cell-mediated elimination of activated donor CD4 T cells also occurred in antibodydeficient (mMT 2/2 ) mice (data not shown), precluding a role for antibody-dependent mechanisms. Activated CD4 T cells did, however, express much higher levels of adhesion molecules than naive cells, and these molecules have previously been shown to trigger NK-cell cytotoxicity via LFA-1 19, 20 . Somewhat surprising was the observation that the activated CD4 T cells were far more susceptible than activated CD8 T cells to direct killing by the NK cells, even though both expressed high levels of adhesion molecules. We previously had shown that the presence of the negatively signalling receptor CD244 (2B4) on NK cells prevented NK-cell-mediated lysis of activated CD8 T cells 21 . We found here that although expression of the CD244 ligand CD48 was upregulated on T cells after medium-dose LCMV infection, expression levels of CD48 were much higher on activated CD8 than on activated CD4 cells (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD48: activated CD4, 3,423 6 147; activated CD8, 6,180 6 166; n 5 9, P , 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. 7) .",

Their effect on activated CD4 T cells was presumably due to direct cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by rapid perforin-dependent elimination of activated CD4 T cells by NK cells in short-term in vivo cytotoxicity assays and the observation of enhanced annexin reactivity ",

The effect of activated NK cells on CD8 T cells and virus clearance seemed to be indirect, and depended on the presence of CD4 T cells, which are known to produce factors that preserve CD8 T-cell viability and functionality 12, 13, [23] [24] [25] . This suggests a three-way interaction, whereby NK cells suppress the CD4 T-cell response, thereby preventing augmentation of the CD8 T-cell response, which, in turn, directly regulates viral clearance and immunopathology in this system (Fig. 4f) . Our observation of direct NK-cell-mediated lysis of T cells during virus infection is distinct from published accounts of NK-cell regulation of antiviral T cells during MCMV infection, in which NKcell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells contributes to control of viral burden and persistence of MCMV-infected dendritic cells that in turn regulate activity of antiviral T cells 6, 7, 26 . Moreover, we found no NK-cell-dependent changes in the number and antigen-presenting function of splenic dendritic cells during LCMV infection (Supplementary Fig. 9 ), consistent with our finding that NK cells directly regulated the T cells. A possible concern was that in vivo cellular depletion with antibodies against NK1.1 and CD4 have the potential to affect frequencies of NKT, cd T and regulatory T cells, but the frequencies of these lymphocytes in the spleen of LCMV-infected mice were not altered after 3 to 4 days of infection by the low concentration of anti-NK1.1 used in these studies ( Supplementary Figs 1 and 10) .",

We show here that at a high dose of LCMV, NK cells act beneficially by suppressing T-cell responses, thereby preventing severe pathology and mortality while enabling the development of a persistent infection from which mice eventually recover and clear the virus 27 . At the medium-dose inoculum, NK-cell suppression of T cells is detrimental to the host, as virus clearance is impaired due to the limited number and functionality of T cells. However, a medium dose of virus is not sufficient for complete clonal exhaustion of T cells, ultimately resulting in severe T-cell-dependent immunopathology that can lead to death of the host.",
