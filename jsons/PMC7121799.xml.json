Radiographic findings, in elderly patients, may include risk factors for increased severity (e.g., cavitations or multilobar involvement). Occasionally, radiological pattern suggests an etiological diagnosis: pneumatoceles suggest infection by S. Aureus, and an upper lobe cavitary lesion suggests tuberculosis. Ultrasound examination of the lungs can be performed bedside for the visualization of pulmonary infiltrates. Several studies and meta-analyses support that ultrasound performs well for the diagnosis of pneumonia if performed by an experienced physician. However, ultrasound examinations are difficult to compare over time and the results may vary between performers [1, 6].",

Oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula up to 5 L/min or by mask 0\u201315 L depending on the type of mask, alternatively via a high-flow system. The SpO2 value should always be interpreted in relation to the respiratory rate and the oxygen fraction in the inspiratory air. Blood gas analysis should be performed liberally in patients with severe CAP. Oxygen treatment of COPD patients should be monitored with repeated blood gas analysis. Hypercapnia indicates the need for more intensive ventilatory support. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which is the primary treatment for exacerbation of COPD, may be a good tool for patients with severe CAP [12]. While the clinical practice guidelines on evidence-based application of NIV for community-acquired pneumonia did not provide a recommendation for its use, the Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines on management of CAP did suggest a cautious trial of NIV [2, 12]. Most studies on NIV and treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, including CAP, have been carried out in the critical care setting and have reported controversial results with varying failure rates for NIV use. Nevertheless, NIV continues to be commonly used for the treatment of severe CAP, especially in the Emergency Department [12, 13].",

            "text": "A recently published retrospective cohort study involving 163 subjects with severe CAP treated with NIV demonstrated that most patients who presented to the ED with CAP and respiratory failure received NIV as first-line ventilatory therapy. The NIV failed in 50% of cases. Risk factors that predicted NIV failure at baseline was: no history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, APACHE II score, need for hemodynamic support and number of CXR quadrants involved. Risk factors for failure after 2 h of therapy were respiratory rate, serum PH, and hemodynamic support. Hemodynamic support was the most strongly associated with failure of NIV [14]. A recent study by Carteaux et al. demonstrated differences in expired tidal volume in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure who failed and succeeded NIV [15]. Higher tidal volume was a significant risk factor for NIV failure on multivariable analysis. A paper by Paolini et al. proposed a protocol to evaluate CPAP responsiveness in patients with acute respiratory failure due to CAP. The responders were defined as patients hemodynamically stable with a PaCO2 < 45 mmHg, those with partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) increase >20% and/or reduction of respiratory distress. In this setting, 66% of subjects benefit from CPAP application. CPAP-responders were less likely to present comorbidities compared to CPAP-non-responders, and responsiveness does not seem to be associated with better outcomes, with the exception of a shorter length of hospital stay [16].",

The key mechanisms of action of HFNC are effective delivery of up to 100% oxygen, washout of the pharyngeal dead space, decreased inspiratory resistance, airway hydration, and positive end-expiratory pressure effect (PEEP range from 3 to 5 cmH2O). Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of HFNC in a variety of clinical situations, such as acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, post-cardiac surgery, post-extubation, and during invasive procedures [17\u201320].",

The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was 55.0 \u00b1 12.2 mmHg at admission and increased by approximately 1.0 \u00b1 7.7 mmHg with conventional oxygen therapy. In contrast, with HFNC therapy, PaCO2 decreased by 4.2 \u00b1 5.5 and 3.7 \u00b1 10.8 mmHg in 1 and 24 h, respectively, resulting in significant improvement in hypercapnia (P = 0.006 and 0.062, respectively).
