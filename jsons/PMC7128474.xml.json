As a result, the international community and the WHO have addressed the problem only in a limited and fragmented manner. Some guidelines and documents are available but they are limited in scope, and in the extent to which they offer tools for national programme managers. They have not been widely translated from their original languages, distributed to other countries and interested parties, nor have they been implemented. A recent inventory of activities and documents related to HAI available at the WHO headquarters and the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO EURO) is summarised in web appendix 1 (http://image.thelancet.com/extras/05ID10006webappendix1.pdf). Among these initiatives, there are some successful examples of programmes related to infection prevention and control, such as the blood and injection safety programmes. However, there is currently no established group or specific programme committed to comprehensively address the problem of HAI at either global or regional levels. Recent events, particularly lessons learned from the SARS epidemic, which had a major nosocomial component, have shown that it is now urgent to bring the HAI issue to the forefront of infection control. Based on these premises, WHO EURO, in collaboration with the International Health and Social Affairs Office of the Veneto Region, Italy, the Department of Infectious Diseases of the University of Verona, Italy, and several departments in WHO headquarters, organised an international consultation to address the issue of HAI in eastern and central Europe.",

Therefore, no meaningful comparison of nosocomial infection rates between different studies in hospitals or countries can be made if survey methods are not harmonised in advance, and if adjustment for case-mix is lacking.25, 26, 27 Hence, there is a need for robust national or international HAI surveillance protocols to obtain comparable and unbiased data. However, substantial progress is to be expected from some European initiatives.",

As a network, HELICS has not yet addressed the reporting of special events such as epidemics, emerging pathogens, and environmental threats. These shortcomings are to be addressed in a follow-up project. The HELICS philosophy is based on the following essential points: the need for legislation making surveillance recommended and/or compulsory through an accreditation process; the choice of meaningful indicators of HAI adjusted for patient characteristics and level of exposure to invasive procedures, and linked to feasible prevention actions; and the identification of a minimum data set, possibly collected through a computerised data management system. A key aspect of the HELICS philosophy is to support the creation of national surveillance networks. Consequently, individual hospitals can only participate through their national network, except under certain circumstances (eg, for piloting if a national network is not available).",

The goal of EARSS is neither to produce crude data, nor to classify countries in a league table, but rather to provide a partnership and a forum for exchange of experiences to stimulate the implementation of national networks. Samples are collected at community and hospital level and the resistance patterns of five major pathogens\u2014Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis\u2014are detected according to international standardised methods and summarised in widely available datasets and figures. Variations in antimicrobial resistance in clinical specimens over time and location are monitored, and used for policy decisions and the assessment of effectiveness of intervention. Figure 4\nillustrates a possible use of the tools of this network to map the prevalence of meticillin resistance among S aureus across European countries.",

Another important working group is the ESCMID Study Group for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ESGARS; http://www.escmid.org/sites/index_f.asp?par=2.5.0&Ref=366), which recently produced a comprehensive and very useful document containing the European recommendations for antimicrobial-resistance surveillance.29 An interesting, EU-funded research project of ESCMID, Antibiotic Resistance Prevention And Control (ARPAC; http://www.abdn.ac.uk/arpac/main-escmid.htm), invest-igated the state of infection control programmes in 167 European hospitals in 2001 using a questionnaire.30 The results showed important differences and inequalities between EU countries in infection control practices (eg, use of alcohol-based handrubs for hand hygiene) and infrastructure (eg, availability of single rooms), and a general lack of auditing and feedback activities to monitor the impact of surveillance and interventions. Finally, the EU has launched a research project, HARMONY (Harmonisation of Antibiotic Resistance measurement, Methods of typing Organisms and ways of using these and other tools to increase the effectiveness of Nosocomial infection control), with the major objective to promote a closer and more productive collaboration with ESCMID. Through this initiative, the efforts of all participating institutions are united to produce harmonised and validated tools that will assist field professionals in dealing with three major issues: antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring, microbial typing, and infection prevention and control.",

Specific educational activities on surveillance methods and use of surveillance data are urgently required; multistep internet modules have been suggested as an innovative, widely accessible, potentially time-sparing option. To ensure that surveillance activities have an impact on infection prevention and control strategies, it is crucial to develop valid processes and outcome indicators and to use them to interact with quality management and patient safety groups. Appropriate ways of ensuring that data collected by surveillance activities are correctly interpreted and made regularly available to the public, patients (and their advocates), national health insurance schemes, and hospital managers, should also be sought.",
