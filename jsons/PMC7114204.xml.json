However, an incomplete pet registration system and a scarcity of electronic medical record systems in veterinary practices limits our understanding of domesticated dogs and cats. To solve this problem, a real-time reporting system for causes of death (CODs) and reasons for euthanasia (RFEs) in cats and dogs was designed in 2011, and has been in operation since.",

To recruit veterinary clinics, the investigators attended regular meetings of regional veterinary medical associations where the system was introduced to the clinicians. Interested owners of veterinary clinics could voluntarily join the program by signing a contract; thereafter, they received specific permission for use of the website, instruction on use of the system, and technical support if needed. Only legally registered veterinary clinics with more than three licensed veterinarians qualified for use of the program. These veterinary clinics tended to offer full service and give more accurate diagnoses.",

Geographic information were accessed based on the owner\u2019s address, which also represented the place where the cats lived. In Taiwan, there are huge differences in human population density and lifestyle between the capital, Taipei City, and other cities. This may be linked to the different lifestyles of the pet cats. In view of this, the variable of whether or not the cat lived in the capital city was applied to the current study in order to clarify the relationship between CODs/RFEs and the location of the cats. Death-related factors included the option for euthanasia and date of death. The option for euthanasia referred to whether or not the animal was chosen to be euthanized.

The MOI group included cases reported simply as \u201cmultiple organ failure\u201d. Causes of death reported as \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cold\u201d were also designated as MOI.

Using the latter categorization scheme, each attributed cause was calculated separately. For further highlighting the comorbidities related to natural death or to euthanasia, results of the 18 groups determined by the first method were divided by the results determined by the second method.

This is in accordance with the Swedish study (Egenvall et al., 2009). This may be related to insufficient water intake and a preference for feeding a dry diet in Taiwan. This has been suggested as an important cause of the development of feline lower urinary tract disease and the progression of feline chronic kidney disease (Elliott and Barber, 1998, Carciofi et al., 2005, Dru Forrester and Roudebush, 2007, White et al., 2011). In both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, death due to renal and urologic disorders was associated with increased age and neuter status (higher in neutered cats), which has been broadly discussed in previous studies. Regarding feline chronic kidney diseases and lower urinary tract diseases, old age is a generally accepted risk factor, while breed predispositions have been variously observed (Buffington et al., 2006, White et al., 2011). It has been observed that the presence of feline lower urinary tract disease is associated with chronic kidney diseases (Mayer-Roenne et al., 2007, White et al., 2013). Because our reporting system was open with minimal interference in the clinicians\u2019 opinions, we found that sometimes urologic disorders could not be separated from renal disorders based on the submitted information. Therefore, urologic and renal disorders were grouped together, and this may constitute a limitation. The interaction between the neuter status and age for the outcome of whether or not the cat died of the renal and urologic disorders was confirmed in our study population. The finding might be resulted from many possible reasons. For instance, neutered cats with longer lifespan have more time to develop renal and urologic disorders, or owners of neutered cats are more likely to take them to the veterinarian when they are sick. Main effects of age and neuter status should be interpreted carefully considering the existence of interaction effect. Further research is needed.",

Young or unneutered cats tended to have a higher risk of dying from trauma, similar to cat populations in Japan, England and Sweden (Egenvall et al., 2009, Inoue et al., 2015b, O'Neill et al., 2015).

The difference may be related to how the owners perceive their pets, how the veterinarians suggest for specific diseases, different cost and different animal welfare strategies between the countries. In addition, strong correlations were noticed between the variables of whether the cat/owner was from the capital city and neuter status, option for euthanasia, and neoplasia as attributing causes. The difference between countries and correlations among geographic variables suggests that spatial variations may be related to different philosophies in veterinary practice, animal welfare issues, cost concerns, and other decision-making issues. Future studies on relevant issues will help in the targeted promotion and enhancement of animal welfare, as has been discussed in several reviews (Moore and Lund, 2009, O'Neill et al., 2014).",

From October 2012 to February 2013, an outbreak of thiamine deficiency in cats due to defective dry food occurred in Taiwan. In severe cases, cats appear to have died from neural disorders (Chang et al., 2016). Based on data collected by our system, a notably higher incidence of neurological disorders attributed to CODs or RFEs occurred during this period as compared to the following two years (data not shown).
