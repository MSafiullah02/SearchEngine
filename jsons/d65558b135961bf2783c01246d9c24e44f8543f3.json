[12] [13] [14] [15] There appears to be a direct relationship between overall antibiotic consumption for VAP and the emergence of newly resistance bacterial strains. 16, 17 The latest and most fearsome example of this trend, due in large part to escalating use of colistin, has been the emergence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance. 18 The development of colistin resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) strains, brings a renewed sense of urgency to minimize any further resistance emergence and to prevent spread of these XDR bacteria. 19 As a result of this trend of increasing antibiotic resistance and boarder spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment of suspected VAP, more precise and rapid microbiologic diagnostic approaches for the antibiotic management of suspected VAP are urgently needed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 153, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 158, "end": 161, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 364, "end": 367, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 599, "end": 603, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 609, "end": 613, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 614, "end": 618, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 765, "end": 768, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The diagnosis of VAP is problematic because noninfectious conditions can cause pulmonary infiltrates and systemic findings such as leukocytosis, fever, and increased oxygen requirements. 20 Various diagnostic criteria with variable rigor have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of VAP. However, the most stringent criteria available have been associated with the greatest observed mortality and establishing the diagnosis of VAP took significantly longer when applying them compared with less stringent criteria, potentially resulting in delayed therapy. 21 Erring on the side of caution, most clinicians employ the finding of a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate and at least one clinical feature (fever, leukocytosis, worsening oxygenation, or purulent tracheal secretions), which has high sensitivity but low specificity for VAP. 22 The difficulty in relying on clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VAP is the potential for over diagnosis, resulting in the unnecessary administration of antibiotics to noninfected patients. This has the potential to promote further emergence of antibiotic resistance, especially when employed for prolonged time periods, and to dilute out the ability of clinicians to identify the beneficial impact of treating patients with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. 23, 24 Owing to the lack of a proven diagnostic method, two different strategies have been used and compared using clinical or bacteriologic criteria, each associated with advantages and disadvantages. 22 The clinical strategy employs the abovementioned clinical and radiographic criteria in diagnosing VAP. A combination of two out of three clinical criteria and a radiographic infiltrate yielded a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 75% for the diagnosis of VAP in 25 mechanically ventilated patients using histology and quantitative lung tissue culture on autopsy as the reference. 25 Increasing the number of clinical criteria resulted in greater specificity but at the cost of lesser overall sensitivity. 25 In a postmortem analysis of 39 mechanically ventilated patients, clinical criteria did not provide reliable predictive accuracy for histologic pneumonia. 26 A semiquantitative endotracheal aspirate culture can be used to identify a causative pathogen of VAP and, if positive, has been shown to correlate with quantitative cultures of the lower respiratory tract obtained via protected specimen brush (PSB). 27 Additionally, a negative endotracheal aspirate culture has good negative predictive value in excluding the presence of VAP if antibiotics have not recently been started or changed. 28 However, semiquantitative cultures are generally not as reliable as quantitative cultures of the lower respiratory tract due to an inability to differentiate between colonization and infection. 29 The use of clinical criteria and a reliance on semiquantitative cultures can result in clinical false-positive results for the diagnosis of VAP resulting in unnecessary antibiotic use.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1319, "end": 1322, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1325, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnostic Criteria for VAP"}, {"text": "The bacteriologic strategy uses quantitative cultures obtained from the lower respiratory tract via endotracheal aspirate, PSB, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia based on thresholds of bacterial growth of !10 5 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for an endotracheal aspirate, !10 4 CFU/mL for a BAL specimen, and !10 3 CFU/mL for a PSB sample. Results of these procedures guide decisions such as when to initiate or stop antibiotics and which drug should be used against the offending agent. There are no definitive data to support the use of one sampling technique over another; however, the cellular analysis of BAL fluid may provide an advantage, as a sample containing less than 50% neutrophils was associated with excellent negative predictive value in one study. 26 Also, given the multifocal nature of VAP, even mini-BAL samples obtained blindly without the use of bronchoscopy can be effective. [30] [31] [32] However, other studies caution on the use of unilateral cultures even when directed to the side of the dominant radiographic abnormality. 33 The bacteriologic strategy has resulted in less overall prescription and more narrowed antibiotic use, an important point given the surge of antibiotic resistance in the ICU setting. [34] [35] [36] A major disadvantage of the bacteriologic approach is the concern for false negatives which could result in cases of nosocomial pneumonia going untreated, especially in the setting of recently introduced antibiotics. 37 Multiple studies have compared the clinical and bacteriologic strategies. Only one prospective, randomized trial demonstrated a mortality benefit when using the bacteriologic strategy at 14 days. 34 Others have failed to reproduce these findings, including a large study conducted by the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group and a comprehensive meta-analysis. 38, 39 In addition, the bacteriologic strategy does not seem to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay. 39 The decision to employ either the clinical or bacteriologic strategy rests with the clinician on a case-by-case basis. If bronchoscopic sampling can be performed safely and the appropriate personnel is available, it is reasonable to utilize this approach as antibiotic decisions may change based on culture results allowing for more effective antimicrobial deescalation. If the clinical strategy is used, the clinician should reevaluate the patient often for guidance on antibiotic usage. Regardless of the diagnostic strategy, an unstable patient with a high pretest probability of nosocomial pneumonia should be initiated on empiric antibiotics, as a delay in antibiotic administration leads to higher mortality. [40] [41] [42] The lack of consistency in establishing a precise diagnosis of VAP has led some national guidelines to reflect on the relatively low accuracy of microbiology cultures as a diagnostic tool in VAP. 22 Moreover, contamination with upper respiratory tract pathogens or endotracheal tube colonizers is common and traditional microbiology laboratory flow with Gram staining, cultures, and antibiotic susceptibility testing requires at least 48 to 96 hours for information to be processed for clinical decision making.

Additionally, they found that increasing DNA load among serial EBCF samples preceded the clinical suspicion of VAP. The potential advantages of this type of diagnostic approach include noninvasive sampling of EBCF, ease of acquiring serial samples to potentially allow preemptive or targeted preventative treatment of early VAP or tracheobronchitis, and pathogen-specific characterization. The latter could help direct antibiotic therapy limiting the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for pathogens that are not identified, thus promoting antibiotic stewardship principles. The main disadvantage of this type of PCR-directed diagnostic approach is that it does not provide true antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the causative pathogens. Volatile organic compound (VOC) detection is another promising diagnostic technology with probably the greatest applicability in VAP. Both humans and bacteria produce VOCs (volatile carbon molecules) as part of their metabolism. The VOCs vary depending on disease states, growth environment, and the presence of other bacteria. This technology is particularly appealing to lung diseases, as it can be monitored noninvasively analyzing exhaled breath (similar to EBCF). Changes in VOC patterns can trigger an early workup and also can be monitored to assess response to treatment. Mass spectrometry can swiftly identify and quantify VOCs. New technologies like electronic noses and optical spectra systems can describe the VOC patterns or fingerprints of bacteria. 78, 79 In a study that included 38 ventilated patients, electronic nose-derived VOC fingerprints showed good correlation with clinical pneumonia scores. 80 A recent study monitored 45 ventilated patients thrice weekly using electronic nose technology. 81 The obtained VOC fingerprints were able to differentiate between infected, colonized, and noninfected patients. The potential for VOC detection in diagnosing lung infections using either few specific biomarkers or the whole VOC fingerprint is currently being actively pursued. 82, 83 Potential Limitations and Implications of Novel Diagnostics for VAP As suggested earlier, 56 experiences with rapid diagnostics for the evaluations of blood culture specimens suggest that rapid diagnostics may play an important role in enhancing antimicrobial prescribing practices in hospitalized patients. The benefits to this can be numerous, including optimizing Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia Kollef, Burnham 259 clinical outcomes, reducing toxicity, and facilitating clinical trials for new anti-infective agents by stratifying patients eligible for the trial at the earliest possible opportunity. However, it is also important to understand the limitations of these new technologies including that they cannot differentiate colonization from infection, which could be highly problematic in mechanically ventilated patients, nor give us the true susceptibility patterns of the responsible pathogens.

There is an urgent need for clinical studies aimed at understanding how to best integrate the use of these new antibiotics with the emerging rapid diagnostic technologies in a way that is cost-effective and sustainable for the long run. 87 In addition, the microbiology laboratory must work closely with their clinical partners to deploy these new diagnostic tools in a manner that will afford the maximum benefit of these new technologies, including incorporation of the antimicrobial stewardship team and interpretative report comments, when applicable. Clinical outcome studies demonstrating the benefit of these new technologies on patient outcomes are needed. VAP may be an ideal infection to demonstrate the impact of rapid diagnostics as a means of enhancing antimicrobial treatment and stewardship. 88 ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Analysis of Exhaled Breath Condensate Fluid and Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Chastre", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J-Y", "middle": [], "last": "Fagon", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "volume": "165", "issn": "7", "pages": "867--903", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Economic impact of ventilatorassociated pneumonia in a large matched cohort", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Hamilton", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Ernst", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol", "volume": "33", "issn": "3", "pages": "250--256", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Predictors of 30-day mortality and hospital costs in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Schramm", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Wills", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Reichley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Micek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Chest", "volume": "134", "issn": "2", "pages": "281--287", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Update on ventilator-associated pneumonia", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["V"], "last": "Guillamet", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Curr Opin Crit Care", "volume": "21", "issn": "5", "pages": "430--438", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "A comparison of ventilator-associated pneumonia rates as identified according to the National Healthcare Safety Network and American College of Chest Physicians criteria", "authors": [{"first": "L", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Skrupky", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mcconnell", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Dallas", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Crit Care Med", "volume": "40", "issn": "1", "pages": "281--284", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Developing a new, national approach to surveillance for ventilator-associated events", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Magill", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Klompas", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Balk", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Crit Care Med", "volume": "41", "issn": "11", "pages": "2467--2475", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Global prospective epidemiologic and surveillance study of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Chastre", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Fagon", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "Crit Care Med", "volume": "42", "issn": "10", "pages": "2178--2187", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "An international multicenter retrospective study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial pneumonia: impact of multidrug resistance", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Micek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Wunderink", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kollef", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Crit Care", "volume": "19", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens Study Group.
