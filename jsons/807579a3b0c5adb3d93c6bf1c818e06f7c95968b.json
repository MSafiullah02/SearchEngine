Numerous molecular methods have been used to genetically characterise new viruses without prior in vitro replication or the use of virusspecific reagents. In the recent metagenomic studies viral particles from uncultured environmental and clinical samples have been purified and their nucleic acids randomly amplified prior to subcloning and sequencing. Already known and novel viruses were then identified by comparing their translated sequence to those of viral proteins in public sequence databases. Metagenomic approaches to viral characterisation have been applied to seawater, near shore sediments, faeces, serum, plasma and respiratory secretions and have broadened the range of known viral diversity. Selection of samples with high viral loads, purification of viral particles, removal of cellular nucleic acids, efficient sequence-independent amplification of viral RNA and DNA, recognisable sequence similarities to known viral sequences and deep sampling of the nucleic acid populations through large scale sequencing can all improve the yield of new viruses. This review lists some of the animal viruses recently identified using sequence-independent methods, current laboratory and bioinformatics methods, together with their limitations and potential improvements. Viral metagenomic approaches provide novel opportunities to generate an unbiased characterisation of the viral populations in various organisms and environments. Therefore, plasma, serum, respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, faeces or filterable environmental samples are most appropriate for viral metagenomic studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "118 118 E.

The primary advantages of sequence-independent amplification and sequencing methods for characterising novel viruses are simplicity and relative speed, the lack of bias towards any particular viral group or requirement for specific reagents and the ability to detect new viruses that are highly divergent from those already known through conserved protein motifs. A limitation of sequence-independent nucleic acid amplification methods for viral discovery is their general unsuitability with samples in which host nucleic acids and viral nucleic acids cannot be easily separated, such as tissue biopsies and PBMC, since the resulting fraction of viral sequences relative to host nucleic acids would be extremely low. For studies of cellular samples the use of microarrays, degenerate primer PCR or subtractive hybridisation may be more appropriate.

Random PCR has been used to characterise a new human parvovirus and identified numerous known RNA and DNA viruses from respiratory secretions [15] ( Table 1) , to amplify both RNA and DNA viruses from cell culture [87] and to identify a short DNA sequence with no sequence similarity in Genbank whose prevalence in plasma is higher in non-A-E hepatitis than control patients [88] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 980, "end": 983, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 984, "end": 987, "text": "86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1136, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1369, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1139, "end": 1147, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Random PCR amplification"}, {"text": "The genomics field is often limited by the amount of starting DNA available.

This method is based on the ability of bacteriophage PhiX29 DNA polymerase to efficiently displace an annealed DNA strand in front of its advancing 3 0 end coupled with its very long processivity ( > 70 000 bases) resulting in multiple displacement amplification reactions [89, 90] (Figure 1 ). The DNA polymerase is primed with modified random hexamer oliogonucleotides (resistant to the 3 0 -5 0 exonuclease activity of PhiX29). When single DNA strands are generated by PhiX29, they can themselves be used as templates ( Figure 1 ). This method achieves unbiased amplification at every human locus analysed [90, 91] (Figure 1 ).

The long dsDNA products can then be cut with a restriction enzyme, expected to cut once within the circle sequence, to release linear fragments the length of the circle (Figure 2 ).

CsCl density gradient ultra-centrifugation was also used directly on plasma pools for the purification of human DNA viruses [93] . Ultrafiltration using a tangential flow filter with a cutoff of Mr 30 000 was also used to purify viruses from filtered seawater followed by ultracentrifugation to pellet viruses [9, 81, 112] .

DNAse I treatment is thought to remove naked DNA through exonuclease digestion while DNA within viral capsids (and within the lipid bilayer in the case of enveloped viruses) are shielded from enzymatic activity. Similar treatment using RNAse A has been used to remove accessible RNA in viral concentrates from faeces [80, 110] and seawater [81] .

If the focus is restricted to DNA or RNA viruses, the extracted nucleic acids can itself be further digested with the appropriate nuclease.

Using computationally demanding search algorithms such as tBLASTx to detect low-level translated protein similarities to known viral sequences is also time consuming [119, 120] . The criterion for classifying sequences into virus-like sequences is also arbitrary. A tBLASTx E score of < 0.001 to a known viral sequence has frequently been used to define a sequence as being of viral origin [79-81, 110, 111] , although others have used a more stringent cutoff of E < 10 \u00c05 [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 295, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 296, "end": 301, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 302, "end": 307, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 476, "end": 481, "text": "[119,", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 482, "end": 486, "text": "120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 700, "end": 717, "text": "[79-81, 110, 111]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 783, "end": 787, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BIOINFORMATICS"}, {"text": "A fundamental problem is how to detect the presence of novel viral sequences when they are so highly divergent from those currently in the databases that sequence similarities are not readily detected using tBLASTx. A large fraction of sequences (5%-30%) derived from animal samples by sequence-independent amplification methods and an even greater fraction of sequences derived from environmental samples show no significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities to any sequence, including viruses, currently in Genbank. The origin of these nucleic acids is therefore of great interest as they potentially represent novel and highly distinct viruses. Several approaches may improve the identification of highly divergent viral sequences. The search for conserved protein motifs is expected to help identify distantly related viral protein sequences since some viral groupings such as positive strand RNA viruses encode a number of recognisable core protein functions [121] . Viral hallmark genes encode viral functions that are found in widely diverse virus groups, have only distant homologues in cells, and whose origins may predate cellular life [122] . For example, genes encoding jelly-roll capsid protein structures or superfamily 3 helicase functions are found in both large and small DNA and RNA viruses [122] . Searching among the annotation of weak similarity matches for viral hallmark gene keywords could also focus further amplification and sequencing efforts to potential viral sequences. The use of substitution matrices, used to quantify protein sequence similarities, generated from viral rather than eukaryotic and prokaryotic protein alignments, may also improve the detection of very low-level similarity to current viral sequences. The computational generation of theoretical ancestral sequences to the numerous extant viral groupings and their subsequent use in sequence similarity searches may also improve the identification of highly divergent viral sequences since the genetic distances of new viruses to their common ancestor with extant species will be reduced. Further bioinformatics improvement could also be based on searching for particular RNA folds related to those frequently found in some RNA viruses [123] and viroid RNA [124] . In silico protein structure predictions using linear nucleic acid sequence, although not yet commonly feasible, may also improve the detection of divergent viruses encoding conserved viral protein structures. Methods that are independent of BLAST based alignments or predicted RNA and protein structure based similarities would also assist in discriminating among unclassifiable sequences those likely of viral versus bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic origins. Dinucleotide sequence analysis takes advantage of compositional biases in a sequenceindependent fashion to establish genomic signatures. The biological pressures that influence genomic composition have been shown to be predictive of evolutionary divergence [125] . For example, CG dinucleotide under-representation in vertebrates relative to bacteria has been attributed to high levels of CpG methylation [126, 127] . Differences in dinucleotide frequencies have been used to successfully identify regions of horizontal gene transfer among bacteria [128] [129] [130] , discriminate exonic and intronic regions of human sequences [131] and differentiate bacterial, plasmid and phage sequences [132] . Virus genomes persist under unique pressures that affect their nucleotide composition. Rapid rates of replication have been proposed to decrease CG dinucleotides due to unfavourable high thermodynamic stacking energies [126] and antiviral host factors, such as APO-BEC3G cytosine deamination, cause G to A mutation in HIV [133] and can mold the genomic composition of viruses. Dinucleotide composition is therefore another potential tool to help discriminate viral from other sequences and select from among unclassifiable sequences those with the most viral-like dinucleotide composition for further studies. Analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies has also been used to discriminate among sequences from different bacterial species, although its use for the short contigs typically generated from viral metagenomics may be problematic [134] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 978, "end": 983, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1165, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1328, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2253, "text": "[123]", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2274, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 2995, "end": 3000, "text": "[125]", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 3143, "end": 3148, "text": "[126,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3153, "text": "127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 3287, "end": 3292, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 3293, "end": 3298, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 3299, "end": 3304, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 3367, "end": 3372, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 3430, "end": 3435, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 3657, "end": 3662, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 3760, "end": 3765, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 4275, "end": 4280, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BIOINFORMATICS"}, {"text": "A more laboratory-based approach to identify highly divergent viral sequences will be to search for closely related nucleic acids repeatedly found in different animal or human samples.

Samples containing low viral concentration yielding only a single viral-like sequence may be further analysed by simply increasing the sampling of the nucleic acid mixture (i.e. sequencing more library subclones or using novel technologies such as pyrosequencing) or by improving viral particle purification. Sequencing costs and limited sample availability (particularly of rare clinical samples) may preclude such approaches and require that initial sequence matches to known viruses be extended into larger sequences using sequence-specific extension methods. If two or more subclones show significant sequence similarity matches to different regions of the same virus, the regions between them may be linked simply using long distance specific PCR [15, 36, 78] . When only a single subclone shows significant similarity to a known virus, this genetic 'foothold' may serve as a region to hybridise a specific primer and acquire further flanking sequence data using 5 0 or 3 0 Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Other chromosome walking methods rely on linear PCR amplifications using a single specific primer bound to the initial foothold region followed by low temperature annealing with a single randomly chosen primer and PCR [135] or first non-specifically binding primers and extending them followed by the use of a specific primer [136] . Ligation of an adaptor linker to the ends of dsDNA followed by PCR using linker and foothold specific primers [137] or based on the formation of DNA circles from which inverse PCR using specific primers [138, 139] or RCA can take place [140] may also be used to acquire flanking viral sequences.

Using RCA, numerous circular viral DNA genomes have been characterised from the blood, tissue and feces of mammals, birds, insects and plants [96, [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 216, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 283, "end": 287, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 378, "end": 382, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 636, "end": 641, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 642, "end": 647, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 648, "end": 653, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 654, "end": 659, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 660, "end": 665, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 666, "end": 671, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 672, "end": 677, "text": "[149]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 678, "end": 683, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 684, "end": 689, "text": "[151]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 926, "end": 930, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1048, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1145, "text": "[152]", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1342, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1559, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1713, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1723, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1729, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1735, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1741, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1747, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1748, "end": 1753, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 502, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Human and animal samples"}, {"text": "The landmark paper by Breitbart et al. analysing viral communities present in seawater started with 200 litres of seawater [79, 111] .

DNA shearing and PCR amplification, rather than direct subcloning, were used to disrupt the potentially toxic viral genes and to remove modified bases often present in bacteriophage DNA which cannot be cloned directly into E. coli. Sixty five per cent of sequences derived from these linker-amplified shotgun libraries were not related to any sequence in the database (tBLASTx E scores > 0.001). Extrapolating from < 1000 sequenced subclones and the number of sequences with overlap, the number of identifiable viral sequences in seawater was estimated to number between 300-7000 new viral types depending on contig assembly stringency. Thirty-forty per cent of the significant tBLASTx hits (E score < 0.001) were for phage sequences, followed by repeat and mobile elements and bacteria, archaea and eukarya sequences based on Genbank annotations [79] ( Figure 3) .

Viral RNA was then reverse transcribed using random hexamers as primers and dsDNA generated using RNAse H and E. coli DNA polymerase. Double stranded DNA was then treated in a manner similar to LASL. This approach yielded 60%-80% of sequences without sequence similarities in Genbank and among those with tBLASTx < 0.001, 98% were related to positive strand ssRNA viruses.
