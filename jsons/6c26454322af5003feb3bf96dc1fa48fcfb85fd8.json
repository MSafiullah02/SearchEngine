            "text": "China's Guangdong province on November 27, 2002. It presented as a respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). At the end of the epidemic in June, the infection affected 8422 individuals leading to 916 deaths and a casefatality ratio of 10.9% across 29 countries. 2 On the other hand, COVID-19 began in Wuhan (China), the largest city in Hubei province, in central China in the last week of December 2019. To date, a cumulative 512 701 cases with 23 495 deaths (case-fatality ratio of 4,6%) were reported across 202 countries 6 and, based on available data, the transmission rate might be higher for COVID-19 than for SARS. The incubation period for SARS was from 2 to 10 days (with mean of 4-5 days) while the average incubation period for COVID-19 is 5.1 days, with a range of 1 to14 days. The average latency of COVID is slightly longer than SARS. 4 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates an average basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 of 1.4 to 2.5, with a median of 1.95. In other words, each patient transmits the infection to an additional 1.95 people. The R0 of the SARS epidemic were approximately 3. 3 In contrast with these values, a study shows that the COVID-19 is already more widespread than SARS because its real average R0 is 3.28. 7 This data indicates that COVID-19 may be more transmissible than SARS. There was a predominance of female patients affected by SARS, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.25. Instead COVID-19 is much more prevalent among males, with a male to female ratio of 2.7:1. 8 Data show that the COVID-19 patients' median age is 59 years, with a range of 15 to 89 years while the median age of patients with SARS was 35 years, with a range of 0 to 92 years and the highest age-specific incidence was in patients with 65-69 years. 2 The early symptoms of SARS and COVID-19 are very similar, including fever, cough, headache, shortness breath and breathing difficulties. Diarrhea was reported in about 20-25% of patients with SARS, while intestinal symptoms were rarely described in patients with COVID-19. In addition, most patients with SARS and COVID-19 developed lymphopenia with high-levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6. 2 T A B L E 1 Main aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)",
