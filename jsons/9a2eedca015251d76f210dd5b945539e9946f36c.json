They are the main reason for respiratory infections and diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe ones. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus belong to the betacoronavirus genus. They are responsible for the recent epidemic worldwide in the recent 20 years. A novel coronavirus (CoV) named \"2019 novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV\", \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\", or \"SARS-CoV2\" has caused the recent pneumonia outbreak named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" or \"COVID-19\" since early December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China which is now pandemic worldwide. The pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of coronaviruses are related to the function of structural and non-structural proteins. Proteases are one of the most important non-structural proteins within the viral replication cycle. They are utilized to produce both functional and structural proteins. Papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2 pro ) and chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL pro25-30 also called M pro ) are the main proteases in SARS-CoV (Mukherjee et al. 2011) . Interestingly, papain-like cysteine protease can damper the antiviral response of host cells (Lindner et al. 2005; Niemeyer et al. 2018) . Helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are the other crucial non-structural proteins that are encoded by coronaviruses genome (Zumla et al. 2016) . The high similarity between the main proteins of SARS-CoV and COVID-19 , 79.5% sequence similarity (He et al. 2020) , suggests drug designed against these proteins in SARS-CoV (Mukherjee et al. 2011 ) could be effective against COVID-19, too.",

This enzyme is the target of some antiviral drugs. Sofosbuvir and ribavirin are nucleotide derivatives. They inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and are used for HCV therapy. IDX-184 is another RNAdependent RNA polymerase that is under clinical trials for HCV therapy. An in silico study proved the efficacy of remdesivir against COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Elfiky 2020). Remdesivir is a novel antiviral prodrug that has been developed against the Ebola virus not only for treatment but also for prophylaxis post-exposure. It showed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro against filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses. Remdesivir has not been approved or licensed at the time of writing this article (Warren et al. 2016 ). Remdesivir is metabolized into an adenosine nucleotide analog that interferes with the action of virus RNA polymerase post entry. It seems to have good inhibitory effects against COVID-19 at the cellular level (Guo et al. 2020) . In a case report, remdesivir was started intravenously on day 7 in a patient with COVID-19 with no side effects (Holshue et al. 2020) . Nausea, vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, and raise of the liver enzymes have been reported with remdesivir consumption (Remdesivir (United States: Investigational agent; refer to Prescribing and Access Restrictions): Drug information 2020).",

Proposed antimicrobial agents against community-acquired pneumonia are amoxicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones. In severe patients, all possible pathogens should be covered by empirical antibacterial treatment until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified [43] . Moxifloxacin is the best recommendation for covering mycoplasma and chlamydia (Zhang et al. 2020b ). Azithromycin, a macrolide, is the best-proposed antimicrobial that has been added to the hydroxychloroquine regimen COVID-19 and induced a synergic effect on virus elimination. This combination therapy (azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day, the next 4 days and hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during 10 days) reduced the number of viral carriages and viral carrying duration (Gautret et al. 2020) . Azithromycin is an antibiotic from the macrolide group that has antiinflammatory effects (Amsden 2005; Beigelman et al. 2009; Iveti\u0107 Tkal\u010devi\u0107 et al. 2006) . Furthermore, it has antiviral (Iannetta et al. 2017; Menzel et al. 2016; Schoegler et al. 2014; Sch\u00f6gler et al. 2014) properties. This may be a reason why adding this drug to hydroxychloroquine improved the clearance of COVID-19. In this regard, there is a need to test azithromycin as first-line therapy for COVID-19. It should be considered that both chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (Silva et al. 2007 ) and azithromycin (Hancox et al. 2013 ) are known to prolong QTc-interval. So this combination therapy may increase the risk of cardiac side effects.",

Ap2-associated protein kinase 1 is one of the main promoters of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its inhibition may disrupt the penetration of the virus into the cells and assembly of its particles. The Janus kinase (JAK) is the other regulator of the passage of the virus into the lung cells. It has been proposed that baricitinib (2 or 4 mg once a day) by inhibition of these kinases may be useful in COVID-19 acute respiratory disease. This drug in one way blocks the virus entry and in the other way inhibits cytokine release and inflammation by inhibiting JAK1/2 (JAK-STAT signaling) (Richardson et al. 2020) . Tofacitinib, baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib all are JAK-STAT signaling i nhibitors and have antiinflammatory effects; however, baricitinib is better than fedratinib and ruxolitinib due to its high affinity for Ap2-associated protein kinase 1, once-daily dosing, and acceptable side effects. It has low protein-binding properties and has no interaction with CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters that cause good potential for combining therapy with baricitinib COVID-19 (Richardson et al. 2020) .",

It promotes cytokine storm by activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory signals and activation of AP-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and downstream cytokines and chemokines pathways. PARP1 activation results in cellular energy failure, necrosis, and cell death (Zingarelli et al. 2004 ).

Although corticosteroid treatment could have a role in suppressing lung inflammation, it was associated with an interruption in the clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions and had no positive impact on the decrease of mortality rate in critically ill patients (Russell et al. 2020) . Corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis, eosinopenia, and a decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytic count especially in T cells (Coutinho and Chapman 2011) . According to the published articles in the 1990s, the administration of corticosteroids induces a transient lymphocytopenia that peaks after 4-6 h and returns to the normal level after 24-48 h. This duration depends on the potency and dose of the administrated corticosteroids (Fauci and Dale 1974; Webel et al. 1974; Yu et al. 1974) . Recently, it has been proven that corticosteroid therapy induces immunosuppression predominantly by suppression of cell-mediated immunity and a minimal inhibitory effect on humoral immunity. In T cell subsets, CD4 + is more susceptible than CD8 + (Baris et al. 2016) . The viral diseases may get wild in the immunocompromised state (Rouse and Sehrawat 2010) and the body cannot fight against COVID-19.",

It may reduce inflammation and fever in patients with COVID-19 and diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. Long-term use of ibuprofen may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid retention, and renal dysfunction even at therapeutic doses.

At present, no specific antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. In this urgent, the researchers are trying to the repositioning of existing drugs against COVID-19. Old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories, including antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti-protozoal, anti-HIVs, anti-influenza, anti-hepacivirus, antineoplastics, neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulins, and interferons. Some of them focus on the SARS-CoV2 fusion/entry process either by inhibition of S1-mediated virus attachment or by blocking of S2-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion, and some of them interfere with viral replication. These proposed agents fight with the virus by modulating host immune response, neutralizing inflammatory cytokines, or inducing passive immunity. Convalescent plasma seems the best therapy until now in patients with COVID-19. Newly introduced Fig. 1 Schematic represents the possible effects of proposed drugs on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AAK1, Ap2-associated protein kinase 1; Ab1, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; IFN1, interferons type 1; JAK, Janus kinase; mRNA, messenger ribonucleic acid; PARP1, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1; RNA, ribonucleic acid; pp1a and 1ab, protein phosphatase 1a and 1ab. activator effect; inhibitory effect; viral cell cycle agents focus mainly on the host cell ACE2 receptors and S receptors on the virus (Table 2 , Fig. 1 ). We suggest attention on bradykinin and its neutralizing agents could be worth full. This pathway is not mentioned in recent research projects. Renin-angiotensin and kallikreinkinin systems are linked to each other through ACE. Kallikrein converts kininogen to kinins, including bradykinin, that is converted to the inactive peptide via ACE. Blocking ACE with ACE inhibitors, antihypertensive drugs, restricts the inactivation of kinins and increases the level of bradykinin (Alhenc-Gelas et al. 2019) .",
