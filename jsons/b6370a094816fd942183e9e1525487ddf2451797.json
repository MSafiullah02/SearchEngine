In patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 requiring NIV, helmets may be the best solution for CPAP or NIV, because of minimal or no dispersion from leaks, easy to filter/scavenge exhausted gas. Due to the scarcity of this interface it is probable that traditional oro-nasal masks will be the most commonly used.

Lessons learned from SARS, H1N1 and MERSIn 2003, NIV was tried in Hong Kong in patients with ARF (initial mean PaO2/FiO2 137) secondary to SARS outbreak. The treatment was carried out in isolation/negative pressure rooms, with a Bi-Level ventilator in spontaneous/timed mode, oro-nasal masks and single circuit with the filter before the expiratory valve. Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 70% of cases and one month after the outbreak no health care worker (wearing fully fledged protective personal equipment, including Powered Air Purifying Respirators) was infected34 . Non invasive ventilation was also used in patients with ARF due to influenza A H1N1 infection, with success rates ranging between 15% and 25% 3536 .More recently, during the MERS outbreak Alraddadi et al37 showed that NIV as first line intervention, although modestly effective was not associated with increased 90 day mortality. No data was available on potential risks of transmission to health care professionals. Considering the usage of HFNC in the pandemic context, Rello J el at 38 , reported cases of ARF due to the pneumonia 2009 influenza A/H1N1v, with a success rate of 39%, and no secondary infections in health care workers (even without negative pressure rooms).

In fact, exhaled air dispersed evenly via the vent holes located circularly around the elbow connection point in all directions at very low normalised smoke concentration <20% 43 .With Nuance Pro Gel (Philips-Respironics\u00ae) and Swift FX (ResMed\u00ae) nasal pillows there was a significant increase in exhaled air dispersion distance for both nasal pillows with increasing CPAP (0.19-0.21 m) 43 .Regarding the performance of Bi-Level modes, substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a one meter region, from patients receiving NIV through oro-nasal masks with integrated expiratory valves or oro-nasal masks attached to an expiratory valve, with more diffuse leakage from the latter, especially at higher IPAP44 . A different oronasal mask with integrated expiratory valve located on the upper part of the mask (Ultra Mirage Medium; ResMed\u00ae) led to substantial exposure to exhaled air occurring within a 0.5-m radius of patients receiving NIV45 . With the Philips-Respironics\u00ae total face mask early model, exhaled air jet through the integrated exhalation port could reach a distance of 0.92 m when NIV was applied using single circuit46 .With the StarMed CaStar R Helmet, leakage of exhaled air was negligible when NIV was applied with a double limb circuit, filters and a good seal at the neck-helmet interface, whereas leakage at the neck interface could reach a maximum radial distance of 0.27 m through another helmet (Sea-Long model) without a tight seal in the interface46 .Using a real human model (with healthy controls, subjects with coryzal symptoms and patients with infective COPD exacerbations) Simonds et al47 showed that NIV using a vented mask produced droplets in the large size range (> 10 \u00b5m) compared with the baseline droplet counts (without any intervention).",

In an experiment with healthy volunteers to simulate a patient coughing while using HFNC to assess the maximum distance of droplet dispersion, Loh et al50 showed that while wearing a well-fitting nasal cannula at 60 L_min-1 flow, cough generated droplets spread up to a distance of 4.50 meters. To circumvent some of the risks of HFNC, some authors propose that the patient wear a surgical facemask on top of the nasal cannulas 51 . A recent simulation of HFNC along with a surgical facemask in place over the cannula, confirms that, at 40 L\u2022min-1, the surgical mask captured 83.2% of particles, at the expense of a moderate reduction in CO2 clearance 52 .

If the patient shows significant increase in work of breathing, we should proceed to intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation 67 . A clear analysis of NIV/HFNC time before invasive mechanical ventilation is most important. Indeed some authors that NIV has a role in self inflicted lung injury (SILI) and the risk of impacting in a change in ARDS phenotype (Paolo Pelosi, personal communication, Webinar ESICM). The extended effect of heated and humidified oxygen in HFNC to avoid mucosal injury, improve secretion clearance, reduce transpulmonary driving pressure, should also be looked at in this setting 68. Its role in preventing injury and accelerate recovery if initiated early in the clinical course should be also analysed.",
