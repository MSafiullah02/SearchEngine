In particular, a specific Skyrme submodel, the so-called Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model, allows both for an exact field-theoretic and a mean-field treatment of neutron stars, as a consequence of its perfect fluid property. A pure BPS Skyrme model description of neutron stars, however, only describes the neutron star core, by construction. Here we consider different possibilities to extrapolate a BPS Skyrme neutron star at high baryon density to a description valid at lower densities. In the exact field-theoretic case, a simple effective description of the neutron star crust can be used, because the exact BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions formally extend to sufficiently low densities. In the mean-field case, on the other hand, the BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions always remain above the nuclear saturation density and, therefore, must be joined to a different nuclear physics equation of state already for the outer core. We study the resulting neutron stars in both cases, facilitating an even more complete comparison between Skyrmionic neutron stars and neutron stars obtained from other approaches, as well as with observations.",

            "text": "The Skyrme model [1] is a non-linear field theory of pion fields which represents a particular proposal for a low-energy effective field theory (EFT) of strong-interaction physics. Baryons are realized as topological solitons (\"skyrmions\") supported by the model [2] , [3] . Already the original Skyrme model incorporates several nontrivial features of QCD in its defining properties, like chiral symmetry and its breaking, the conservation of baryon charge, or the extended character of nucleons. Further, it leads to a reasonable description of the physical properties of nucleons [4] and some light nuclei [5] - [7] . Several features, however, impede its use as a quantitatively precise EFT of nuclear and strong-interaction physics. First of all, it leads to too high (classical) binding energies of nuclei. Secondly, some skyrmions are more symmetric than the nuclei they are supposed to descibe and do not reproduce the alpha-particle clustering observed in physical nuclei. Related to this issue, also the description of nuclear excitation spectra is only partially successful. In the last years, however, generalizations both of the Skyrme model itself [8] - [17] and of the methods employed for its physical applications [18] - [24] have been introduced which already improved this situation significantly. On the one hand, several generalizations of the Skyrme model have been proposed which alleviate the binding energy problem. As demonstrated very recently, the coupling to vector mesons [11] , in addition, also leads to the desired alpha particle cluster structures [25] . On the other hand, a more refined treatment of quantum excitations of skyrmions, beyond the rigid rotor approximation, has led to a vastly improved description of some nuclear excitation spectra [19] - [24] .",

This socalled BPS (Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield) Skyrme model L BPS \u2261 L 6 + L 0 has several features which make it an interesting model for certain bulk properties of nuclear matter and, in particular, of neutron stars. First of all, it is a perfect fluid already at the microscopic (field theoretical) level, without any need for a thermodynamical or hydrodynamical limit. A thermodynamical (mean-field) limit may, nevertheless, be performed easily [40] , [39] . Secondly, a topological bound (BPS bound) for the static energy can be derived, and there exist infinitely many BPS solutions saturating the bound, with energies proportional to the topological charge [8] , [39] . The resulting classical nuclear binding energies are, therefore, zero, and small, realistic binding energies can be achieved by including further small corrections to the energy (spin, isospin, Coulomb energy, . . . ) [9] , [39] . Thirdly, the sextic term L 6 provides the leading contribution to the energy and equation of state (EoS) for the generalized Skyrme model (I.1) in the limit of large density, and this contribution to the EoS exactly coincides with the (leading) contribution induced by the omega meson repulsion in relativistic mean field theories (RMF) of nuclear physics [41] , like the Walecka model [42] , [43] . This fact, together with the perfect-fluid property of the BPS Skyrme model, is the underlying reason for its success in the description of the central regions of NS, which provide the main contributions to their bulk properties. We want to emphasize that this possibility to describe the central, high-density region of NS by a simple and well-motivated physical model is particularly important, because the properties of baryonic matter at these high densities are still poorly understood, whereas low density regions can be described by standard methods of nuclear physics. The relevance of skyrmionic NS is further underlined by the observation that certain generic consequences of the Skyrme model, like a rather stiff EoS at high density or relatively large maximum masses M max > 2M of NS, are supported by recent observations, disfavoring models with too soft EoS.",

            "text": "As a consequence of the above, the baryon density of BPS Skyrme NS within a mean-field theory (MFT) approach is bounded from below by n 0 and takes the value n 0 at the NS surface. Physically, describing a NS purely by the BPS Skyrme model within MFT implies that only the infinite (or symmetric) nuclear matter aspects of NS matter are modeled. For n > n 0 , we still have different equations of state (EoS) for different MFT BPS Skyrme models, which are related to different choices for the potential U, see section IV. In principle, already in the region of high density n > n 0 , isospin corrections to the BPS Skyrme NS masses should be considered, to account for the mainly neutron nature of nucleons in a NS. Numerical calculations, however, indicate that these isospin corrections are small. More importantly, it is well-known from standard nuclear physics calculations that NS contain peripheral regions of lower density n < n 0 . This implies that the equation of state (EoS) resulting from the MFT BPS Skyrme model must be joined to a standard nuclear physics EoS at some point n * > n 0 . The NS core is, thus, divided into an inner core n > n * , described by the MFT BPS Skyrme model and an outer core described by a standard nuclear physics EoS. Concretely, we shall use the universal EoS of [44] , which is based on a Brueckner-Hartree-Fock many-body calculation for the core and the BCPM (=Barcelona-Catania-Paris-Madrid) nuclear energy density functional for the crust (BCPM EoS for short). The situation is slightly different for the exact field theory solutions of BPS Skyrme NS. First of all, the perfect fluid described by the exact BPS Skyrme model (beyond MFT) is non-barotropic, and an algebraic EoS relating the energy density \u03c1 and the pressure p does not exist, see section IV. A low-density completion of an exact BPS Skyrme NS, therefore, cannot be achieved by simply joining different EoS. Secondly, the microscopic baryon density of an exact BPS Skyrme NS is zero at the NS surface and, therefore, takes arbitrarily small values close to it. Still, for low densities a NS description in terms of the exact BPS Skyrme model will probably not be reliable, and a low-density completion is required. In particular, the BPS Skyrme model leads to a homogeneous matter distribution, whereas matter in the crust of a NS is known not to be homogeneous, essentially consisting of droplets of nuclear matter embedded in a gas of nucleons and electrons. A rather obvious proposal, thus, consists in using the exact BPS Skyrme NS for the core region and a different description for the crust region. The core-crust (cc) transition typically occurs for baryon densities n cc \u223c (1/2)n 0 , where the precise value of n cc is slightly model dependent. The above proposal, however, meets two obstacles, namely the difficulty in joining an exact BPS Skyrme NS with a NS derived from an EoS mentioned above, and the intrinsic difficulty of a full microscopic description of the inhomogeneous crust. To overcome these problems, we propose to use the effective description of the NS crust recently developed in [45] . This effective description cannot lead to a complete description of the complicated crust structure, but it reproduces the bulk observables of NS (masses, radii) with a surprisingly high precision. It is one of the aims of this paper to apply the effective crust description of [45] to the NS resulting from the exact BPS Skyrme model.",

As a result, the above expressions for \u00b5 are no longer equivalent, leading to the obvious question of which one to use to define the chemical potential. Some simple thermodynamical considerations allow us to answer this question. For a perfect fluid, the densities \u03c1, n and p are the natural variables, so definition (III.1) does not apply directly. Further, without gravity (and in the absence of external potentials), both the temperature (zero in our case) and the chemical potential must be spatially constant in thermodynamical equilibrium. In particular, a non-constant chemical potential would allow to lower the energy by re-arranging the baryonic matter. But only definition (III.4) implies a constant chemical potential for an equilibrium (constant pressure) configuration. Finally, in the presence of gravity, both the temperature [48] and the chemical potential [49] are redshifted (no longer constant) in equilibrium, i.e., T \u221a g 00 = const. and \u00b5 \u221a g 00 = const.

On the other hand, if the crust and core EoS stem from different nuclear models (non-unified EoS), then the matching at the core-crust (cc) interface introduces uncertainties, especially for the NS radius. The procedure of [45] does not require a knowledge of the crust EoS, at all. All that is required are some NS core properties derivable from the core description (core mass, core radius, the chemical potential at the core radius (or cc interface), \u00b5 cc ), and the chemical potential at the NS surface (a physical input value).

Here, \u00b5 0 and \u00b5 cc are determined from physical considerations. \u00b5 0 is the energy per baryon of iron, \u00b5 0 \u223c 930 MeV. Further, calculations for different unified EoS determine \u00b5 cc to be about \u00b5 cc \u223c 955 MeV [45] . This is the value we shall use in this paper, implying (\u00b5 cc /\u00b5 0 ) = 1.027. r cc is now determined from the core EoS. For a barotropic fluid in the core, \u00b5(r) may be determined directly from the solution of the TOV equations using the algebraic relation (III.3). r cc then follows from \u00b5(r cc ) = \u00b5 cc = 955 MeV. For a non-barotropic fluid in the core, only the differential relation (III.4) or (III.5) is available, and the full function \u00b5(r) in the core (including the multiplicative constant) can only be determined by imposing one additional physical condition. Finally, the NS mass can be expressed as a sum of the core and crust mass contributions, M NS = M core + M crust . Here, M core = m core (r cc ) is the value of the mass function m core (r) for the core EoS evaluated at r = r cc . Further, taking into account the smallness of M crust , M crust /M core << 1, it may be determined from the TOV equation (II.6) by using an even cruder approximation.

In a more general model, probably both terms will contribute, but we chose the two extreme cases for simplicity. Further, their approach to the vacuum is as required from physical considerations (the quadratic approach of U \u03c0 provides the pions with a mass, whereas the quartic approach of U 2 \u03c0 induces a repulsive short-range interaction, alleviating the binding energy problem [14] - [16] ). On the other hand, they are rather peaked at the anti-vacuum h = 1, leading to large central baryon densities already in the case without gravitation. We, therefore, chose the flat potential U flat as an example which avoids these high central baryon densities. For a flat potential like (IV.22), the baryon density is constant in the region of constant potential by construction, as an immediate consequence of the constant pressure equation (IV.16). This behavior probably provides a more realistic modeling of nuclear matter for high densities, and the potential (IV.22) is a concrete example thereof. In any case, the detailed determination of the correct Skyrme model potential will require a fitting to many more observables of nuclear physics.",

Further, the baryon number B is an input parameter on which \u03c1 and p depend explicitly. As a consequence, solutions do not exist for arbitrary initial values p 0 \u2261 p(r = 0). Instead, for each B the corresponding p 0 must be found such that at the NS radius R BPS of the pure BPS model (without crust) the condition p (R BPS ) = 0 is satisfied [37] , [38] . There is a second reason why, in a first step, the full integration of the pure BPS model (core model, without the effective crust) from r = 0 to r = R BPS is required. As explained, for the exact BPS model (like for any non-barotropic fluid) only the differential relation (III.5) for the chemical potential is available, which allows to determine the functional dependence of \u00b5 but not its absolute value. This absolute value can be determined by the following observation. As explained, the classical soliton solutions of the BPS Skyrme model correspond to infinite nuclear matter. But this implies that at the surface of the pure core (BPS Skyrme) NS, where p core (R BPS ) = 0, the chemical potential should be equal to the energy per baryon of infinite nuclear matter, \u00b5 0,core (R BPS ) = 922.9 MeV. From this absolute value, the radius r cc where \u00b5(r cc ) = 955 MeV can now be determined, and for r \u2265 r cc the BPS solution is replaced by the effective crust, as described in Section III.B. We show our results for the potentials considered in this paper in Fig. 1 . In particular, for the potential U 2 \u03c0 (central panel of Fig. 1 ) we find that the M -R curves with and without crust are almost the same for M \u2265 0.5M . The reason is that, for this potential with its quartic approach to the vacuum, the energy density in the \"tail\" region of the pure core NS (close to R BPS ) is very small for the full BPS model. As a consequence, the \"post-Newtonian\" approximation implied by the procedure of [45] gives a result which is rather close to the full field theory result in this region.",

This construction is, however, no longer consistent in the MFT case. Indeed, the MFT BPS Skyrme NS ends at a density n(R) = n 0 , therefore the putative \"crust\" must be joined at some n * > n 0 . If this n * is chosen very close to n 0 , then the resulting \"crust\" thickness is unrealistically small. If, on the other hand, n * is chosen sufficiently large to provide a reasonable crust thickness, then the corresponding crust mass is no longer small, and the self-consistency of the whole construction breaks down. In the MFT case, therefore, we join the EoS resulting from the MFT BPS Skyrme model for n > n * to the BCPM EoS of [44] for n < n * , for some n * > n 0 , as explained in the introduction. In other words, we assume that the EoS of [44] is valid both for the crust n < n cc and for the outer core n cc < n < n * , whereas we use the MFT BPS Skyrme EoS for the inner core n > n * . For simplicity, we will use the corresponding pressure value p * = p(n * ) to fix the transition point.

The BCPM EoS for the (liquid) core in [44] is derived using some advanced standard methods of many-particle nuclear physics based on the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) approach (plus the BCPM density functional for the crust), where nucleons are treated as quantum mechanical point particles. For the outer core n cc < n < n * , nuclear matter is rather well understood, and the EoS of [44] can be expected to provide a precise description of NS matter. For densities which are significantly higher than n 0 , on the other hand, the EoS of [44] -like all other proposals -must be considered an extrapolation. One basic assumption of this extrapolation is the adequacy of a point-particle description of nucleons even at high density. Skyrme models, on the other hand, are paradigmatic examples of EFT where nucleons are extended objects (topological solitons), and their extended nature is the underlying cause for the rather high stiffness of the resulting nuclear matter at large densities. A Skyrme model treatment of nuclear matter, therefore, allows us to confront these different assumptions and to scrutinize their consequences for nuclear matter at high density and for the resulting NS properties. We remark that one common assumption of the EoS of [44] and of the Skyrme model is the absence of additional degrees of freedom (hyperons, quarks, etc.) in the interior of NS (this was one reason to choose the EoS of [44] for our comparison, in addition to its rather up-to-date character).

In the BPS Skyrme model, both an exact and a MFT calculation of NS are possible and must be distinguished. For the exact case, we find that the method of [45] can be applied without problems and leads to the following typical behavior. The crust contribution to the total NS radius is significant only for rather lowmass NS (below one solar mass). This is related to the high stiffness of nuclear matter described by the BPS Skyrme model. At high density, the BPS Skyrme model reaches the maximally stiff EoS \u03c1 \u223c p + const., and this limit is approached rather soon. The high stiffness also explains two further results which can be appreciated in fig. 1 , namely the rather high maximum NS masses and the fact that the radius increases with the NS mass in the region between one and two solar masses. Concretely, we chose the BPS Skyrme model for the three potentials U \u03c0 , U 2 \u03c0 and U flat , for the reasons explained in section IV.B. It turns out that the resulting bulk NS properties are R\u00b4 \u00d1\u00b5 qualitatively similar for the three cases.

            "text": "In the case of a MFT description of BPS Skyrme NS, a crust cannot be attached directly to the BPS Skyrme NS using the method of [45] . Instead, the EoS of the BPS Skyrme model must be complemented with a standard nuclear physics EoS at low densities. Concretely, we chose the BCPM EoS of [44] . Even so, bulk properties like the M (R) curves are not very different between the exact and MFT cases. We want to emphasize, however, that coordinate-dependent observables like densities differ considerably between MFT and exact calculations [38] , particularly for the potentials U \u03c0 , U 2 \u03c0 considered in this letter, see footnote [53] below. A further consequence of the high stiffness of the BPS Skyrme model is that the baryon densities in the interior of a NS remain relatively low. Indeed, as can be calculated easily, for the models U \u03c0 and U flat even in the center r = 0 the baryon density never increases by more than a factor of about three in comparison with the case without gravity [53] . For the potential U flat this can be easily inferred from Fig. 3 . The exception is the model U 2 \u03c0 where the baryon density at the center grows to about 4.5 times the saturation density n 0 for the maximum mass NS [37, 38] . This is related to the fact that U 2 \u03c0 is rather peaked around the anti-vacuum, and may imply that potentials which are flatter there are more realistic. We introduced the potential U flat (which approaches the vacuum like U 2 \u03c0 but is flat in the large-field region) precisely for this reason. Indeed, baryon densities which are not excessively large in the interior of a skyrmionic NS are important for the self-consistency of the Skyrme model approach to NS. The Skyrme model only describes standard nuclear matter, by construction. There are no contributions from exotic hadrons, and a dissolution of baryonic matter into quarks does not occur. But this assumption would be rather unlikely in an environment of extremely high baryon density. If, on the other hand, the baryon density never exceeds several times the density of normal (non-gravitating) nuclear matter, then this assumption is much more plausible. Within the generalized Skyrme model (I.1), the sextic term L 6 is responsible for this behavior [41] , which underlines its importance. It describes a strong repulsion acting on compressed nuclear matter as a result of the strong interaction. In RMF models of nuclear matter, this repulsive force is induced by the omega meson. In other words, a stiff EoS, rather low baryon densities and a description entirely in terms of standard nuclear matter are characteristic features of a skyrmionic approach to NS, which distinguishes it from many other approaches. The observed high-mass NS with M > 2M , which require rather stiff nuclear matter, are a strong argument in favor of this approach, all the more so because the inclusion of additional degrees of freedom tends to soften the EoS. The same line of reasoning also explains the preliminary finding that isospin contributions to the skyrmionic NS may be ignored in the NS core. It is equivalent to the statement that for compressed nuclear matter the repulsive force induced by the strong interactions is much more important than the degeneracy pressure. Of course, these arguments do not apply to the NS crust, but the effective crust description of [45] was introduced precisely with the aim of avoiding a detailed description of the crust, which does not seem to be very important for NS bulk properties.",

As a next step towards a more complete description of NS, the full model (I.1) should be considered. In this case, an ansatz leading to a spherically symmetric energy density is no longer available (except for baryon number B = 1). A full field theoretic treatment is, therefore, beyond current possibilities. As to a MFT approach, we already know two limiting cases, namely the perfect fluid of the BPS submodel and the crystal provided by the L 2 + L 4 submodel. It follows that the full generalized model (I.1) will show a rather complex pattern also in MFT, possibly with several topological phase transitions, depending both on parameter values and on baryon density. Taking into account the scaling behavior of the different terms, however, it is plausible to assume that the inner core will continue to be described by a fluid, whereas the outer core will show some type of crystalline structure. Owing to its slightly softer overall EoS, the full model will also lead to smaller maximum NS masses and to slightly smaller NS radii for a given NS mass, which might be desired features. In particular, recent observations of gravitational waves emitted from inspiraling NS binaries seem to imply an upper bound on the maximum NS mass of about M max \u223c 2.3M [54] and a value of R \u223c 11 km for a 1.4M NS [55] . The pure L 2 + L 4 Skyrme crystal leads to a maximum NS mass of about 1.9 M and to a maximum radius of about 11 km [30] , [36] , therefore an appropriate combination of the standard and BPS Skyrme models should be able to naturally accommodate these most recent constraints.",
