Although the applications of PMAs can differ widely, the same general concept to detect interaction partners is applied in all.

Since then, Michaud et al. have extended this approach to proteome-wide yeast PMAs and compared the specificity of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies [3]. Additionally, PMAs of recombinant proteins have been used to identify potential diagnostic markers. For example, PMAs of human recombinant proteins were used to determine the humoral immune responses associated with different diseases, such as the autoimmune diseases discussed by Robinson in this issue. Also, PMAs presenting microbial and viral proteins have been introduced for the identification of new potential diagnostic markers and vaccine candidates. For example, Kreutzberger and co-workers [4] analyzed sera of meningitis patients with PMAs presenting 67 selected recombinant Neisseria meningitides proteins. Patient serum antibodies recognized 70% of these proteins. More than half of all patients tested had antibodies against the OpaV protein, making it a potential diagnostic marker. Another bacterial PMA, containing 149 Yersinia pestis proteins, was used to profile antibody responses in sera of rabbits immunized previously with live plague vaccine [5]. In total, 50 proteins triggered an immune reaction, of which eleven were identified as potential candidates for new diagnostic markers or vaccine components. Viral PMAs were used by Qiu et al. [6] for investigating the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and screening identified a unique immunogenic protein as a promising vaccine candidate.",

All proteins were synthesized using a wheat-germ-based cell-free protein translation system shown to be suitable for high-throughput protein expression [9]. Supplementing the translation system with Cy3-dC-puromycin yielded fluorescence-labeled proteins that could be directly used for array-based interaction screens. The authors demonstrated previously [10] the incorporation of different fluorescent dyes at the C-terminus of the proteins, providing the basis for array-based interaction screens with multiple putative interaction partners in parallel. Accordingly, we expect a rapid application of this innovative approach on a larger scale. In another instance, Letarte et al. studied the interaction between the human leukocyte membrane protein CD200 and its cell surface receptor hCD200R. Using a panel of point-mutated receptors, the antigenic epitopes of two monoclonal antibodies were mapped. Subsequently, a low affinity interaction, CD200 binding to its receptor, was demonstrated [11].",

The findings were verified by electro-mobility shift assays [13]. Probing a proteome-wide yeast PMA with fluorescently labeled genomic DNA identified over 200 DNA binding proteins [14]. The results are in excellent agreement with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Half of the identified proteins are known or expected to be DNA binders, whereas the remaining half are novel DNA interactors.

However, the detection of each analyte requires two specific antibodies binding to different regions of the analyte. A third detection antibody is commonly applied to avoid potential loss in specificity and sensitivity of the detection antibody as a result of the labeling reaction. Using a third antibody, however, can result in increased unspecific signals due to recognition of the conserved regions of both the capture and the detection antibody. To overcome this obstacle, Song et al. [20\u2022] removed the Fc part of the tumor-marker capture antibodies by pepsin digestion and arrayed the antigen-binding fragments F(ab\u2032)2 for six different tumor markers. Subsequently, calibration curves were derived using pure and serum diluted tumor markers.

Taking the total content of phospholipase C into consideration, the authors determined the relative phosphorylation level of PLC\u03b31 to be rapidly up-regulated within the first 2.5 min of stimulation with CD3 cross-linking. The CD3-dependent up-regulation diminished to baseline by 10 min. CD28-dependent stimulation resulted in a less pronounced, but more prolonged phosphorylation of PLC\u03b31.

After hybridization of a circular DNA molecule, the primer is extended \u2018endlessly\u2019 by a polymerase. Subsequently, specific Cy3- and/or Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides complementary for the elongated DNA fragment are hybridized, producing specific signal amplification. The major advantage of RCA is the superior sensitivity and reproducibility; up to 30-fold increase in signal intensity has been reported [35]. Gao et al. successfully applied the RCA detection to an AMA consisting of 84 distinct antibodies specific to serum proteins. Comparing the protein expression profile of 24 lung cancer patients to equal numbers of healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, several proteins were identified as more abundant in lung cancer [36].",

Additionally, for the directed immobilization of antibodies S-layers \u2013 self-assembling structures resembling bacterial cell walls \u2013 can be used.

With respect to the limited level of consistency between different commercial DNA microarray platforms for expression profiling [51, 52] common standards for protein microarrays should be agreed upon soon. Currently, several pilot studies have been carried out by the International Human Proteome Organization (HUPO: http://www.hupo.org) and the HUPO standardization initiative proposed standards for data exchange (MIAPE) [53, 54]. Additionally, standards for proteomics are under discussion in different national initiatives, such as the quality control management of the German National Genome Research Network (http://www.ngfn.de) and the US National Institute of Health Roadmap: \u2018Standards in Proteomics\u2019 (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/buildingblocks/proteomics/).",

All standards should contain detailed information, such as the aim of the array based experiment, the experimental design, the content and the design of the array as well as the quality control of the content, and controls included in the array. In addition, information (origin, isolation, labeling) on the sample incubated with the array, the procedures and parameters of incubation and subsequent downstream processing, image acquisition and quantification are needed. Ideally, an extended minimum amount of information \u2014 similar to the MIAME standards [55] proposed for DNA microarrays should be established. For the area of antibody microarrays, normalization procedures for comparative abundance analysis have already been adapted from the cDNA microarray field [50\u2022]. Despite the significant challenge associated with this task, the work of Haab et al. [56] shows that applying common standards yields equivalent results from different laboratories.",
