To detect early SARS-CoV infection, a one-step, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed that could simultaneously detect nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes of SARS-CoV with the same PCR condition using either Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System or Roche LightCycler. The sensitivity of this assay was evaluated using cell culturederived viruses, in vitro transcribed viral RNA, and clinical specimens. The SARS-S, -M, and -N primer/probe sets described in this paper could detect one to ten copies of in vitro transcribed S, M, and N RNA per test using both the ABI and Roche assay systems. The relative sensitivities for detecting cell culture-derived SARS-CoV were 0.01, 0.01, and 0.001 PFU/test, respectively. It showed that SARS-N has comparable detection efficiencies to SARS2 and SARS3 which are primers sets designed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, SARS-S and SARS-M also demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to the commercially available RealArt HPA-Coronavirus reagents (Artus). The relative sensitivity of these primer/probe sets was also examined using human sera spiked viruses and clinical specimens from four confirmed SARS patients. Similar results as above were obtained. Specificity tests and sequence alignment showed that these primer/probe sets annealed perfectly to 31 isolates of SARS-CoV; and there was no cross detection with other coronaviruses and human respiratory tract-associated viruses. Therefore, not only is it compatible with the ABI and Roche systems, this multiple-gene detection assay also",

This new emerging virus is the causative pathogen of SARS and was named SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b] . The genome of coronaviruses is about 30,000 nucleotides (nt), the largest found in the RNA viruses, and features their genes in the order of 5 0 -polymease (rep), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)-3 0 with short untranslated regions at both termini ]. The rep gene products are translated from genomic RNA, the remaining viral structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) are translated from subgenomic mRNAs that feature a 3 0 -coterminus and a 5 0 leader sequence . Therefore, the 3 0containing transcripts are the most abundant RNA species of coronaviruses [Holmes, 2001] . The genomic organization of SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses, but phylogenetic analysis indicates that it should be a distinct new group within the genus of Coronavirus [Holmes, 2001; Brown and Tetro, 2003; Ruan et al., 2003; Tsui et al., 2003; Yeh et al., 2004] .",

These viruses all belong to the family of Coronaviridae, and many viruses in this family may elicit respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals [Lai and Holmes, 2001; Ksiazek et al., 2003] . Group 1 and 2 of human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, respectively) are responsible for about 30% of upper respiratory tract illness [Lai and Holmes, 2001] . Besides coronaviruses, many other viruses, such as adenoviruses and influenza viruses, also induce lesions in the respiratory tract. Given the initial symptoms of SARS-CoV infection are so similar to those of the respiratory tract illness caused by other viruses, it is essential to develop diagnostic methods to distinguish the infections between them. Furthermore, many individuals or healthcare workers who suffered from SARS were exposed to SARS-affected patients with fever at the initial stage Poutanen et al., 2003 ]. The availability of a rapid, sensitive, specific, and accurate diagnostic test to confirm SARS-CoV infection is essential to immediately alert healthcare professionals and, in turn, prevent others from coming into contact with probable SARS individuals.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization [WHO, 2003a] , current diagnostic methodologies for SARS-CoV infection include molecular testing using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); antibody tests by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluoresence assay (IFA); and virus isolation using Vero E6 cells. The methods using RT-PCR for detecting SARS-CoV viral RNA are safer and faster than cell culture-based assays. In addition, real-time RT-PCR assay systems employing fluorescent DNA probes in a 5 0 exonuclease assay (TaqMan) have been developed for a variety of pathogens, including SARS-CoV [Lanciotti et al., 2000; Nijhuis et al., 2002; Warrilow et al., 2002; Poon et al., 2003; Emery et al., 2004] . These TaqMan detection assays offer advantages over the traditional RT-PCR techniques of increased sensitivity and specificity, decreased contamination, high throughput, and capable of providing absolute quantitation [Bustin, 2000] . However, laboratories performing SARS-CoV specific RT-PCR tests should still adopt quality-control procedures which include reconfirmation of positive specimens. WHO also suggests that amplifying a second genome region from SARS-CoV may increase the test specificity [WHO, 2003b] . For these purposes, a realtime quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) assay was developed that can be run under a universal RT-PCR condition to amplify S, M, and N genes from SARS-CoV simultaneously for quick, sensitive, and specific detection of the virus. Moreover, the primer probe sets and the PCR condition to be illustrated here could be applied to both ABI Prism 7700 and Roche LightCycler systems, whichever is available in the laboratory.",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was provided by Dr. Konan Peck (Academia Sinica, Taiwan). The SARS-CoV was manipulated in a laboratory certified with biosafety level-3 (BSL3). The clinical samples used in this study were collected from SARS patients at late and convalescent stage of SARS-CoV infection. The four SARS patients were seen in Tri-Serve General Hospital during the stage II epidemic in Taiwan. All were confirmed as meeting the World Health Organization's definitions of probable SARS cases, meaning they were showing typical clinical symptoms and were confirmed as having SARS-CoV infection by RT-PCR with SARS-specific primers Emery et al., 2004] . Confirmation was made by the Center for Disease Control of Taiwan.",

Therefore, our multi-gene quantitative RT-PCR assay provides more data for SARS diagnosis and offers the advantages of double-checking the presence of SARS-CoV RNA in the specimens as well as test specificity.",

Our multi-gene real-time RT-PCR assay is an Positive detection ratio of three independent experiments. The definition for positive interpretation is same as Table II . ideal candidate for clinical application owing to its capability of running three Q-PCR assays simultaneously plus the added benefit of satisfying the positive criteria for determining SARS-CoV infection recommended by WHO. All that is required is a single round of PCR. Such, a test that can detect multiple viral genes is of importance for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV during an outbreak because, not only can it save time from reconfirmation but also enables rapid classification and management of probable SARS cases. In addition to the ability of producing timely results, the single-step and ''closed-tube'' nature of this real-time RT-PCR can minimize the potential of laboratory cross-contamination as compared with the nested RT-PCR suggested by WHO.",

For the RNA containing 3 0 co-terminal nucleocapsid region that is the most abundant species [Holmes, 2001] , it should be the ideal amplification target and exhibits the highest detection sensitivity. Indeed, the SARS-N primer set could detect just 1 copy of viral RNA and was more sensitive than other primer sets regardless of whether the templates were obtained from cell culturederived viruses, in vitro transcribed viral RNA, or clinical specimens (Tables II-VI) . Other primer/probe sets that detect the SARS-CoV N region, such as CDC SARS2 and SARS3, also display a higher sensitivity than that detecting viral genome other than the N region (Tables II and VI) . These data suggest that the primer sets for detecting SARS-CoV N region should be the best choice for high sensitive detection.",

The sensitivities of the SARS-S, -M, -N and the Artus Q-PCR assays using SARS-CoV spiked human sera were lower than those using cell culture-derived viruses. There is a difference of approximately three cycles in Q-PCR assays using these two types of templates (Table II and V) . It is possible that much of the naked SARS-CoV RNA in cell culturederived viral preparation is sensitive to certain degrading agents in human sera, such as RNase during the onehour incubation of spiked viruses at room temperature (see Materials and Methods). However, the sensitivity of the SARS-S, -M, and -N Q-PCR assay for SARS-CoV spiked human sera is satisfied at a level that is as low as [Sizun et al., 1998; Avellon et al., 2001; Coiras et al., 2003; Escors et al., 2003 ]. b Cp values are 50, no fluorescence signals are detected. (Table V) . It suggests this assay may be used in clinical specimens without apparent inhibitions. Due to the SARS specimen control policy in Taiwan, we were unable to acquire clinical samples of SARS patients in the acute phase. The available clinical specimens were mostly obtained from the last stages of SARS-CoV infection, therefore, the viral load may be reduced in these samples as a result of the raised host immune response in late phase. This may also be the reason why the C T values from these specimens were relatively higher than those from the acute phase. However, for these specimens, our SARS-N Q-PCR assay results were as good as the CDC SARS-2 primer/probe which had been evaluated with many other human clinical samples [Emery et al., 2004] . The sensitivity of the SARS-M Q-PCR is lower than SARS-N and SARS-2 but is better than the Artus kit and BNIOUT for these clinical samples (Table VI) . Based on these comparisons, our assay may be suitable for clinical diagnosis during acute phase of SARS as presented by CDC SARS2 and Artus kit.",
