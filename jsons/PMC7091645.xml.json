            "text": "Congenital neutropenia (CN) is a group of rare and inherited hematological disorders characterized by chronic profound neutropenia caused by impaired differentiation of neutrophilic granulocytes. Often diagnosed early in life, CN is defined as recurrent, life-threatening bacterial infections (e.g., skin infections, otitis, gingivitis, abscesses and sepsis) [1]. The elastase, neutrophil-expressed (ELANE) gene encodes neutrophil elastase, and is responsible for ELANE neutropenia, which is probably the most frequent and one of the most severe CN forms, based on its infection rate [2]. Two distinct ELANE-related CN phenotypes have been described: cyclic neutropenia (CyN), in which neutrophil counts classically oscillate with 21-day periodicity, and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), with persistently low blood neutrophil counts [3, 4]. The standard-of-care for ELANE-neutropenia patients consists of granulocyte-colony\u2013stimulating factor (GCSF) administration, which increases the numbers of circulating neutrophils, thereby lowering infection-related mortality. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is indicated for the rare patients with GCSF-refractory disease (i.e., no absolute neutrophil count (ANC) increase at \u226550 \u00b5g/kg/day) or those with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [5\u20137].",

In 2005, our team showed [8] that the CN leukemia risk depends on two major features, the genetic defect and GCSF use, with the latter controlling the patients\u2019 infection rates. The relationship between high-dose GCSF exposure and leukemic transformation was confirmed in 2006 by the International Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry (ISCNR), in which the USA, Canada, UK, the Netherlands, and Germany participate [9]. Based on those results, guidelines were issued in France recommending HSCT for patients receiving high-dose GCSF, while the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry has continued to collect data prospectively. This practice represents an extension of the validated indication of HSCT for CN.",

The database was approved by the French computer watchdog commission (CNIL certificate no. 97.075). Thirty-five French pediatric hematology\u2013oncology units and ~50 adult hematology units participate in the FSCNR. A clinical research associate assured accurate data monitoring, based on annual on-site reviews of medical charts. The following parameters are currently recorded: sex, age at diagnosis, severe bacterial or fungal infections (septicemia, cellulitis, pneumonia, osteitis and liver abscess), complete blood cell counts, differential bone-marrow cell counts (smear method) and all information on HSCTs. Each patient had to provide written informed consent to be entered in the FSCNR. Several reports on the FSCNR are available elsewhere [2, 8, 19\u201324].",

Our first important observation is that the HSCT outcome for ELANE- neutropenia patients was good, with overall 95% engraftment survival and 90% long-term survival. Extending HSCT to a small number of patients requiring high-dose GCSF proved beneficial and may lower their risk of AL.",

The first clonal event was shown to occur in the colony-stimulating factor-3 (CSF3R) clone [34], but the ultimate clonal evolution involved a broader panel of mutations at the time of leukemic transformation [35, 36]. Although such information is crucial to following patients with ELANE-germline mutations, the initial step of leukemogenesis in ELANE-neutropenia patients involved CSF3R mutations, which appear to be induced by GCSF therapy, and is sufficient to trigger MDS\u2013AL. Taking into consideration the GCSF \u2018load\u2019, key information on early patient management may potentially help make the clinical decision about the HSCT indication.",
