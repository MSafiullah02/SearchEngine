            "text": "More recently, a cDNA-derived recombinant version of this biologically derived vaccine was developed, designated rHPIV3cp45. The rHPIV3cp45 vaccine contains the 15 known attenuating mutations present in the biologically derived virus [24]. The use of a cDNA approach has the advantage of using a virus with a short, well-characterized passage history as well as the ability to readily regenerate and modify the virus as needed [7]. The rHPIV3cp45 vaccine was recently evaluated in a phase I trial in which infants ages 6\u201312 months were randomized to receive two doses of rHPIV3cp45 vaccine or placebo, administered 4\u201310 weeks apart [25]. While the safety profile and the infectivity of the first dose of rHPIV3cp45 were similar to that previously observed with the biologically derived virus, the second dose of vaccine was highly restricted in replication and did not boost serum antibody responses [25]. For this reason, we explored whether extending the interval between doses might enhance the infectivity and immunogenicity of a second dose of vaccine. The purpose of this study was to determine the tolerability, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two 105 TCID50 doses of rHPIV3cp45 administered 6 months apart to HPIV3 seronegative infants and children.",

The results of this study confirmed our initial experience with rHPIV3cp45 [25]: the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated with good rates of infectivity and antibody response following a single dose of vaccine. We demonstrated that children with a substantial antibody response following the first dose of vaccine did not seem able to be either infected or boosted when a second dose was administered approximately 6 months after the first dose. In contrast, the second dose of vaccine given six months later appeared to boost antibody titers in those with a suboptimal response following the first dose, and it was associated with lower amounts of detectable virus in the nasal wash. Of interest, children who required a second dose of vaccine to achieve an antibody response were significantly younger than those who did not. Overall, this study demonstrated that two doses separated by 6 months are able to infect children under three years of age who were not infected with a single dose of vaccine.",

The detection of adventitious agents using molecular diagnostic techniques was helpful in assessing potential causality of fever in subjects in this trial, since many of both placebo and vaccine recipients had fever associated with infection with other viruses during the trial. Since HPIV3 typically circulates during the spring and summer months when these trials are conducted, sequence analysis proved a useful tool for differentiating between infection with wt and vaccine virus. This technology is important in assessing the safety and reactogenicity of vaccines and the conduct of clinical trials: illness in a placebo recipient was able to be directly related to infection with wtHPIV3 and not to potential spread of vaccine virus in the clinic setting.",
