            "text": "This chapter is devoted to the hierarchical QSAR technology (HiT QSAR) based on simplex representation of molecular structure (SiRMS) and its application to different QSAR/QSPR tasks. The essence of this technology is a sequential solution (with the use of the information obtained on the previous steps) of the QSAR paradigm by a series of enhanced models based on molecular structure description (in a specific order from 1D to 4D). Actually, it's a system of permanently improved solutions. Different approaches for domain applicability estimation are implemented in HiT QSAR. In the SiRMS approach every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality, and symmetry). The level of simplex descriptors detailed increases consecutively from the 1D to 4D representation of the molecular structure. The advantages of the approach presented are an ability to solve QSAR/QSPR tasks for mixtures of compounds, the absence of the \"molecular alignment\" problem, consideration of different physical-chemical properties of atoms (e.g., charge, lipophilicity), and the high adequacy and good interpretability of obtained models and clear ways for molecular design. The efficiency of HiT QSAR was demonstrated by its comparison with the most popular modern QSAR approaches on two representative examination sets. The examples of successful application of the HiT QSAR for various QSAR/QSPR investigations on the different levels (1D-4D) of the molecular structure description are also highlighted. The reliability of developed QSAR models as the predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the basis of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic, biological, etc. experiments. The HiT QSAR is realized as the suite of computer programs termed the \"HiT QSAR\" software that so includes powerful statistical capabilities and a number of useful utilities.",

            "text": "Nowadays the creation of a new medicine costs more than one billion dollars and the price of this process is growing steadily day by day [1] . During recent decades different theoretical approaches have been used to facilitate and accelerate the process of new drugs creation that is not only very expensive, but also is a multistep and long-term activity [2] . The choice of approaches depends on a presence or absence of information regarding a biological target and the substances interacting with it. A situation, when we have a set of biologically active compounds (ligands) and have no information about a biological target (e.g., receptor) is the most common. Different quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approaches are used in this case. For many years, QSAR has been used successfully for the analysis of huge variety of endpoints, e.g., antiviral and anticancer activity, toxicity [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Its staying power may be attributed to the strength of its initial postulate that activity is a function of structure and the rapid and extensive development of the methodology and computational techniques. The overall goals of QSAR retain their original essence and remain focused on the predictive ability of the approach and its receptiveness to mechanistic interpretation [15] . Many different QSAR methods [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] have been developed since the second half of the last century and new techniques and improvements are still being created [21] . These approaches differ mainly by the principles and levels of representation and description of molecular structure. The degree of adequacy of molecular structure models varies from 1D to 4D level:",

So, usually these models have an auxiliary role only, but sometimes they can be used as independent virtual screening tools [22] . \u2022 2D models contain information regarding the structure of a compound and are based on its structural formula [20] . Such models reflect only the topology of the molecule. These models are very popular [3, 23] . The capacity of such approaches is due to the fact that the topological models of molecular structure, in an implicit form, contain information about possible conformations of the compound. Our operational experience shows that 2D level of representation of the molecular structure is enough for the solution of more than 90% of existing QSAR/QSPR tasks. \u2022 3D-QSAR models [16, 17, 19, 20] give full structural information taking into account composition, topology, and spatial shape of molecule for one conformer only.

This method has proved efficient in numerous studies for solving different \"structure-activity/property\" problems [3, 10-12, 22, 25-37] . The essence of the strategy presented is based on the solution of QSAR problems via the sequence of the permanently improved molecular structure models (from 1D to 4D) ( Figure 5-1) . Thus, at each stage of the hierarchical system, the QSAR task is not solved ab ovo, but with the use of the information received from a previous stage. In fact, it is proposed to deal with a system of permanently improved solutions. It leads to more effective interpretation of the obtained QSAR models because the approach reveals molecular fragments/models for which the detailed development of structure is important. The main feature of the strategy presented consists of the multiple-aspect hierarchy (Figure 5-1), related to \u2022 models describing molecular structure (1D \u2192 2D \u2192 3D \u2192 4D); \u2022 scales of activity estimation (binomial \u2192 nominal \u2192 ordinal \u2192 continual); \u2022 mathematical methods used to establish structure-activity relationships [pattern recognition \u2192 rank correlation \u2192 multivariate regression \u2192 partial least squares (PLS)]; \u2022 final aims of the solution of the QSAR task (prediction \u2192 interpretation \u2192 structure optimization \u2192 molecular design).",

It is necessary to note that after the 2D modeling, the QSAR task is solved at the 4D level, because there is no a priori information available about a \"productive\" conformation (the conformer that interacts with a biological target most effectively) for 3D-QSAR models. This information comes only after the development of 4D-QSAR models and activity calculation for all conformers considered. Then the information about the \"productive\" (the most active) conformation is transferred to the 3D-QSAR level. This is the main difference between HiT QSAR and ordinary 3D-QSAR approaches, where the investigated conformers have been chosen through a less vigorous process. When an investigated activity is mainly determined by the interaction of the exact \"productive\" conformation (not by the set of conformers) with a biological target, it is possible to construct the most adequate \"structure-property\" models at this stage. In all cases (1D-4D), different statistical methods can be used to obtain the QSAR models (the \"Statistic block\" in Figure 5 -1).",

Evidently, it is very difficult to obtain a model that can solve all the problems related to the influence of the structure of the studied molecules to the property examined. Thus, to solve every definitive task, it is necessary to develop a set of different QSAR models, where some of them are more suitable for the prediction of the studied property, the others for the interpretation of the obtained relationships, and the third for molecular design. These models altogether, in combination, solve the problem of the creation of the new compounds and issue relating to the desired set of properties. The important feature of such an approach is that the general results obtained from a few different independent models always are more relevant. It's also necessary to note that these resulting QSAR models have been chosen in accordance with the QECD principles for the validation of (Q)SARs [38] , i.e., they have a defined endpoint, an unambiguous algorithm, a defined domain of applicability (DA), mechanistic interpretation, have good statistical fit, and are robust and predictive.

We consider that specification of atoms only by their nature (actually reflects atom identity, for example, C, N, O) realized in many QSAR methods limits the possibilities of pharmacophore fragment selection. For example, if the -NH-group has been selected as the fragment (pharmacophore) determining activity and the ability of H-bond formation is a factor determining its activity, H-bonds donors, for example, the OH-group will be missed. The use of atom differentiation using H-bond marks mentioned above avoids this situation.

Although the most adequate description of stereochemistry of compounds is possible only on 3D and 4D levels of molecular structure modeling, 2D models of molecules can also provide stereochemical information. In the case when a compound contains a chiral center on the atom X (X = C, Si, P, etc.), the special marks X A , X R , X S (A -achiral X atom, R -\"right\" surrounding of X atom, S -\"left\" surrounding of X atom) can be used to reflect the stereochemistry information of such a center. In each case, the configuration (R or S) of a chiral center can be determined by the Kahn-Ingold-Prelog rule [43] . For example, in the situation where atom X has been differentiated to three different types depending on its stereochemical surroundings, i.e., X A , X R , X S , the different types are analyzed in the molecular model as separate atoms. Conventionally, such molecular models can be considered as 2.5D because not only topological (molecular graph) but also stereochemical information has been taken into account. If simplex vertexes (X atoms) have been differentiated by some physicalchemical properties (e.g., partial charges, lipophilicity) then the differences between atoms X A , X R , X S will be leveled as in normal 2D models. For subsequent QSAR analysis, the simplexes differentiated by atom individuality have been used separately and in combination with those differentiated by physical-chemical properties.",

The interaction of a mixture with a biological target cannot normally be described simply as the average between interactions of its parts, since the last interactions have different reactivity. It is also applicable for mixtures of compounds with synergetic or anti-synergetic action [45] . Because of these issues, the SiRMS approach has been developed and improved in order to make this method suitable for the execution of QSAR analysis for molecular mixtures and ensembles. With this purpose it's necessary to indicate whether the parts of unbound simplexes belong to the same molecule or to a different one. In the latter case, such unbound simplex will reflect the structure not of a single molecule, but will characterize a pair of different molecules. Simplexes of this kind are structural descriptors of the mixtures of compounds ( Figure 5-3) . Their usage allows for the analysis of synergism, anti-synergism, or competition in the mixture's interaction with the biological target. Obviously, such an approach is suitable for different nD-QSAR models, where n = 1-4 1 . If in the same task both mixtures and single compounds have been considered, it's necessary to represent individual compounds as the mixture of two similar molecules for the correct description of such systems [46] . Thus, this approach has been named by authors as \"double nD-QSAR.\" Although such methodic is suitable only for binary mixtures, it can be easily extended to more complicated tasks. For molecular ensembles (associates), it is necessary to use one more simplex type -simplexes with intermolecular bonds. In this chapter, the application of the \"double nD-QSAR\" approach is demonstrated with the example of chiral AChE inhibitors [46] (see Section 5.4.4).",

However, in addition, molecular properties are described with a variety of complementary parameters. The whole set of parameters generated ranges from the most simple, such as the presence or absence of particular atoms in the molecule, to more sophisticated parameters that could be used for the consideration of the stereochemistry of the analyzed molecule and its interaction with the environment. The description of compounds includes several steps. In the first, the spatial structure of the analyzed molecules is obtained from experimental data (i.e., X-ray analysis) or from quantum mechanical calculations. In the case of flexible molecules, it is necessary to select one of the stable conformations. This may be achieved using a conformational search [47] or some complementary information regarding the biologically active conformation of the molecule. The conformation of each molecule is placed into a lattice of cubic cells. The size of a cell can be varied, by default it equals 2 \u00c5, that corresponds approximately to the average van der Waals radius of an organogenic atom. The invariant disposition of the molecule in the lattice is achieved by the superposition of the center of mass of the molecules with the origin of the coordinates. In addition, the principal axes of inertia of the molecule are also superimposed with the coordinate axes of the lattice. If the analyzed structures contain a large common structural fragment, their alignment is carried out mainly according to this fragment.",

In order to reflect the structural features of a whole molecule, it is necessary to carry out the Fourier transformation [53] for the spectrum of structural parameters. The spectrum of structural parameters is the discrete row of values arranged in a determined order. The mode of ordering is not crucial (frequently descriptors are lexicographically ordered), but it must be the same for all compounds of an investigated task. As a result of the Fourier transformation, the high-frequency harmonics characterize small fragments while the low-frequency harmonics correspond to the global molecule properties. The Fourier transformation of a discrete function of parameters P(i) can be presented as Eq. (5-7):",

The rule represents \"IF-THEN\" logical construction. For example, a simple rule can be \"IF lipophilicity > 3 THEN compound is active.\" In fact, such model is presented by a set of consecutive nodes, and each of them contains certain sets of compounds which correspond to this node rule. The CT method has several advantages: obtaining of intuitively understandable models using natural language, quick learning and predicting processes, non-linearity of obtained models, and the ability to develop models using ranked values of the activity (it allows for the analysis of sets of compounds with heterogeneous experimental activity values). The usage of CT methods for QSAR analysis is limited due to the poor mechanistic interpretation of the models.

The essence of AVS consists of the following: at the first step of the AVS the model containing all descriptors is obtained. Then variables with the smallest normalized regression coefficients (b i , Eq. (5-17)) are excluded from the X-matrix and in the next step the PLS model is obtained. This procedure has been repeated stepwise until the amount of variables equals 1. The AVS strategy can be used either for all structural parameters or after different variable selection procedures (e.g., removal of highly correlated descriptors, TV procedure, GA). An application of the AVS procedure resulted in the decreasing of the model complexity (number of descriptors and latent variables) and an increase in model predictivity and robustness.",

Thus, total structural dissimilarity toward the rest of initial training set compounds could be calculated for every molecule from a sum of the corresponding Euclidean distances. In the meanwhile, all the compounds were divided into groups depending on their activity, where the number of groups equals the number of molecules that one wants to include into test set. Then one compound from each group has been chosen to go to the test set according to its maximal (or minimal) total Euclidean distance from the other molecules in this group, or by random choice. Most likely, the use of several (three is the enough minimum) test sets constructed by different principles and subsequent comparison and averaging of the obtained results is more preferable than the use of only one set for the model validation. In that way, the first test set has been constructed to maximize its diversity from the training set, i.e., the compounds with maximal dissimilarity were chosen. This is the most rigorous estimation, sometimes it can lead to the elimination of all of the dissimilar compounds from the training set, i.e., such splitting of the training set when the test set structures would not be predicted correctly by the developed model and would be situated outside of DA. The second test set is created in order to minimize its diversity from the training set, i.e., less dissimilar compounds from each group were removed. The last test set has been chosen in random manner taking into account activity variation only.",

Targets of the first level are activity prediction or virtual screening. Any descriptors could be used here, even those that are only poorly interpretable or noninterpretable, e.g., different topological indices, informational-topological indices, eigenvalues of various structural matrices. In other words, at this level descriptors which are not expected to be used for subsequent analysis of structural factors promoting or interfering with activity can be used. The aims of the second level must include the interpretability of obtained QSAR models. Only descriptors which have clear physico-chemical meaning, e.g., reflecting such parameters of the molecule such as dipole moment, lipophilicity, polarizability, van der Waals volume, can be used at this level. Analysis of QSAR models corresponding to this level allows one to reveal structural factors promoting or interfering with the investigated property. Such information can be useful for the generation of hypotheses about mechanisms of biological action and assumptions about the structure of biological target. Finally, the presence of information useful for molecular design is expected from QSAR models corresponding to the third level of purposes. As a rule, fragmentary descriptors have been used in such models. In this case, the analysis of the degree and direction of influence of such descriptors on activity can give immediate information for the optimization of known structures and design of novel substances with desired properties.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, QSAR investigations must be used to make predictions for compounds with unknown activity values (so-called \"virtual screening\"). In order to increase the quality of predictions, these authors recently started to apply consensus QSAR modeling which has become more and more popular [67] . It also represents one of the crucial concepts of HiT QSAR [31, 36] and can be briefly described by the statement \"More models that are good and different.\" The efficiency of this technique can be easily explained by the fact that nearly the same predictions obtained by different and independent methods (either statistical or descriptors generation) are more reliable than single prediction made by even the best fitted and predictable model. From another aspect, in order to analyze the predictivity of PLS models and according to the OECD QSAR principles [38] , different DA procedures have been included in the HiT QSAR. The first procedure is an integral DA called \"ellipsoid\" developed by the authors [11] . It represents a line at the 1D level; an ellipse at the 2D level; an ellipsoid at the 3D level; and multidimensional ellipsoids in more complicated n-dimensional spaces. Its essence consists of the following: the distribution of training set molecules in a space of latent variables T 1 -T A (axes of coordinates) can be obtained from PLS. For each coordinate axis (T 1 and T 2 in our case) the root-mean-square deviations S T1 and S T2 have been determined. DA represents an ellipsoid that is built from the molecules of the training set distribution center (T 1 = 0; T 2 = 0) with the semi-axes length 3S T1 and 3S T2 , respectively [11] ( Figure 5-5) . Further, the correct positions in relation to this center have been calculated for every molecule (including molecules from prediction set). If a work set molecule does not correspond to the DA criteria, it is termed \"influential,\" i.e., it has unique (for given training set) structural features that distinguish it from the other compounds. If a new molecule from the prediction set is situated out of the DA (region outside ellipsoid), its prognosis from the corresponding QSAR model is less reliable (model extrapolation). And, naturally, the prognoses for molecules nearest to the center of the DA are most reliable.",

Vectors that unite these points (directed from inactive to active) depict the tendency of activity change in the variable space.

The simplest way is soft drug design [72] that consists of replacing of undesired substituents by more active ones, or by the insertion of fragments, promoting the activity instead of non-active parts of molecule or hydrogen atoms. The use of this technique allows one to retain newly designed compounds in the same region of structural space as the training set compounds. The accuracy of prognosis can be estimated using the DA techniques (see below). However, the use of soft drug design keeps within the limits of the initial chemical class of training set compounds. More drastic drug design is, certainly, more risky, but it allows for much more dramatic results. Almost certainly, new structures would lie outside the DA region. That, however, does not mean uncertainty of prediction, but extrapolation of the model predictivity and a certain lack of any DA procedure. However, at the same time, we can receive compounds of completely different (from initial training set) chemical classes as the output of such design. It was demonstrated in [12, 28, 29] , where, in searching for a new antiviral and anticancer agents, we started our investigations from macrocyclic pyridinophanes and through several convolutions of QSAR analyses came out with nitrogen analogues of crown ethers in the first and acyclic aromatic structures with the azomethine fragment in the second case.",

It is necessary to note that the transition to 3D level allows for the improvement of the quality of the QSAR models obtained. At the same time, the usage of the Fourier parameters does not lead to good predictive models (R 2 test = 0.37-0.51) for this task. United models (simplex + Fourier) have the same predictive power as the simplex ones, but, because of the presence of integral parameters, they are sufficiently different to provide another aspect of the property.",

Spirobromine -a medicine with a nitrogen-containing dispiro structure possessing anti-HSV-1 activity was included in the training set. The statistic characteristics of QSAR models obtained are quite high (R 2 = 0.84-0.91; Q 2 = 0.61-0.68; R 2 test = 0.68-0.71) and allow for the prediction of antiherpetic activity, cytotoxicity, and selectivity of new compounds. Electrostatic factors (38%) and hydrophobicity (25%) were the most important determinants of antiherpetic activity (Figure 5-8) . The results of the QSAR analysis demonstrate a high impact of individual structural fragments for antiviral activity. Molecular fragments that promote and interfere with antiviral activity were defined on the basis of the models obtained. Thus, for example, the insertion of non-cationic linkers such as N-(2-aminoethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine, ethylenediamine, or piperazine instead of dispirotripiperazine leads to a complete loss of activity while the presence of methyloxirane leads to a strong increase. Using the established results and observations, several new dispirotripiperazine derivatives -potential antiviral agents -were computationally designed. Two of these new compounds (1 and 2, Table 5 -4) were synthesized. The results of biological tests confirm the predicted high values of antiviral activity and selectivity (they are about two logarithmic units more active and one order more selective than spirobromine) as well as low toxicity of these compounds. The antiherpetic data set was similar to that for the anti-influenza study and was also characterized by essential structural variety: different macrocyclic pyridinophanes and their acyclic analogues plus well-known antiviral agents including acyclovir as a reference compound: The antiherpetic activity against HSV-1 strain US was expressed as a percentage of the inhibition of HSV reproduction in treated cell cultures (Hep-2) in comparison with untreated ones. As in previous cases, the antiherpetic study has a multistep cyclic character: synthesis -biological tests -QSAR analysis -virtual screening and computer-assisted drug design -synthesis -, etc. [25, 28, 29, 34] . Initially, 14 compounds (mostly macrocyclic pyridinophanes and their acyclic analogues) have been investigated for antiherpetic activity [29] . At the present stage [25] , after the several QSAR convolutions, 37 compounds were divided between training and test sets (26 and 11 compounds respectively) and the set of QSAR models with different adequacy levels (2D, 4D, and 3D) has been obtained as a result of the investigations. All the obtained QSAR models were well fitted, robust, predictive (R 2 = 0.82-0.90, Q 2 = 0.60-0.65, R 2 test = 0.70-0.78), and have a defined DA and clear mechanistic interpretation. For the 3D-QSAR investigations the set of \"productive\" conformers has been used. They were determined as the most active from the results of 4D-QSAR modeling.",

            "text": "All the models developed (2D-4D) indicate the impact of hydrophobic (~50%) and electrostatic (~20%) factors on the variation of antiherpetic activity. The strong promotion of antiherpetic activity by aminoethylene fragments was revealed. It was also discovered that an important factor for the HSV inhibition is the presence of an amino group connected to aliphatic fragment. A tendency of antiviral activity increasing with the strengthening of acceptor properties of compound's aromatic rings was revealed. This information was used for the design of potent antiherpetic agent 1 (Table 5 -4). The use of SiRMS allows to progress in searching for new antiherpetic agents starting from macrocyclic pyridinophanes [29] and finishing in symmetric piperazine containing macroheterocycle 1,4,7,10,13, 16 was developed using HiT QSAR based on SiRMS to reveal chemico-biological interactions governing their activities as well as their probable mode of action, and to design new compounds with a strong antiviral activity [11] . The common logarithms of 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) in HeLa cells, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) against human rhinovirus 2 (HRV-2), and the selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /IC 50 ) of [(biphenyloxy)propyl]isoxazole derivatives were used as cytotoxicity, antiviral activity, and selectivity assessments, respectively. The set of molecules consists of 18 compounds including pleconaril as a reference compound. They have not been divided into training and test sets because of the low number of compounds (i.e., the structural information contained in each molecule in this case is unique and useful). The statistic characteristics of the resulting 2D-QSAR models are quite satisfactory (R 2 = 0.84-0.92; Q 2 = 0.70-0.87) for the prediction of CC 50 , IC 50 , and SI values and permit the virtual screening and molecular design of new compounds with high anti-HRV-2 activity. The results indicate the high influence of atom s individuality on all the investigated properties (~40%), electrostatic factors on selectivity (~50%), where these factors along with atom individuality play the determining role, and hydrophobic interactions on the antiviral activity (~40%). The presence of terminal 5-trifluoromethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole and p-fluorophenyl fragments in a molecule leads to strong enhancement of its useful properties, i.e., increase of activity toward HRV-2 as well as selectivity and decrease of cytotoxicity. An additional terminal aromatic ring -naphthalene or phenyl -strongly reduces activity toward HRV-2 and, to a lesser degree, SI. The virtual screening and molecular design of new well-tolerated compounds with strong anti-HRV-2 activity has been performed on the basis of QSAR results. Three different DA approaches (DA rectangle and ellipsoid as well as leverage) give nearly the same results for each QSAR model and additionally allow for the estimation of the quality of the prediction for all designed compounds. A hypothesis to the effect that external benzene substituent must have negative electrostatic potential and definite length L (approximately 5.5-5.6 A) to possess strong antiviral activity has been suggested. Most probably, the fluorine atom in the para-position of terminal aromatic ring (compounds 2-4, Table 5 -4) is quite complementary (L = 5.59 A) to the receptor cavity for such an interaction. It is necessary to note that pleconaril (L = 5.54 A) completely satisfies the indicated criteria. In the case of nitroaromatics, the accumulation of nitro groups in the region of receptor cavity will lead to strengthening of electrostatic interactions with the biological target and, therefore, to an increase in activity.",

Hydrophobic/hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions also played an important role (15-22%). The shape of molecules (4D and 3D models) also effects anti-influenza activity but has the smallest influence (11 and 16%, respectively).

The panel of investigated human malignant tumors includes 60 lines of the following nine cell cultures: leukemia, CNS cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cancer. Anticancer activity was expressed as the percent of the corresponding cell growth. The training set is very structurally dissimilar and consists of 30 macrocyclic pyridinophanes, their analogues, and some other compounds. The use of simple topological models generated by EMMA [85] allows the description of the anticancer activity of macrocyclic pyridinophanes (MCP) for only five cell cultures [86] . These studies show that even within the simple topological model it is possible to detect some patterns of the relationship between the structure of MCP and their activity. The consideration of spatial structure improves the situation, but only at the 4D level reliable QSAR models (R 2 = 0.74-0.98; Q 2 = 0.54-0.84) were obtained for all of the investigated cells (except leukemia, where Q 2 < 0.5; however, even in this case the designed compound was predicted correctly) and averaged activity (most of lines and cells are highly correlated) that indicate the importance of not the most active or favorable single conformer but the set of interacting conformers within the limits of energy gap of 3 kcal/mol. It was discovered that the presence of the N 1 ,N 3 -dimethylenepropane-1,3-diamine fragment strongly promotes anticancer activity. This fragment was used as a linker between two naphthalen-2-oles that leads to the creation of universal anticancer agent active against all mentioned tumors except prostate cancer. It is necessary to note that the use of SiRMS allow one starting from 12 macrocyclic pyridinophanes [86] in the search for anticancer agents to finally result in symmetric open-chained aromatic compounds connected by above-mentioned linker [10] .",

The comprehensive analysis of variations in toxicity as a function of the position and nature of the substituent was performed. Among the contributions analyzed in this work are the electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions of toxicants to biological targets. Molecular fragments that promote and interfere with toxicity were defined on the basis of models obtained. In particular, it was found that in most cases, insertion of fluorine and hydroxyl groups into nitroaromatics increases toxicity, whereas insertion of a methyl group has the opposite effect. The influence of chlorine on toxicity is ambiguous. Insertion of chlorine at the ortho-position to the nitro group leads to substantial increase in toxicity, whereas the second chlorine atom (at the para-position to the first) results in a considerable decrease in toxicity. The mutual influence of substituents in the benzene ring is substantially non-additive and plays a crucial role regarding toxicity.

It has been shown that all of them are quite close between themselves and the vector of observed activity values. Hence, T. pyriformis toxicity by nitroaromatic compounds is complicated and multifactorial process where, most probably, factors determining penetration and delivery of toxicant to biological target play the most important role. Reactivity of nitroaromatics, seemingly, only has an auxiliary role. This was confirmed by the absence of any correlation between toxicity and Hammett constants of substituents. In this regard, the difference in the mechanisms of toxicant interaction with biomolecules (reactions of nucleophylic substitution or radical reduction of nitro group) is important but do not determine for the value of its toxicity.",

PLS models based on compounds from one mechanism of action were used for consensus predictions only in the case when the CRT model was able to predict such a mechanism. Thus, the predictivity of the consensus model on the external test set was quite satisfactory (R 2 test = 0.64). Atom individuality (including stereochemistry of the chiral surroundings of the asymmetric phosphorus atom) plays the determining role in the variation of activity and is followed by the dispersion and electrostatic characteristics of the OPs. The molecular fragments promoting or interfering with the activities investigated were determined. Identical fragments in the achiral compounds have smaller contributions to activity in comparison with their role in chiral molecules. The influence of phosphorus on the AChE inhibition has a wide range of variation and is very dependent on its surroundings. The substitution of oxygen in \u2265 P = O by sulfur leads to decreasing AChE inhibition. The presence of the 2-sulphanylpropane fragment facilitates a decrease in activity. Oxyme-containing fragments are actively promoting with activity. The most active predicted compound (2-[(E)-({[cyano(cyclopentyloxy)phosphoryl]oxy}imino)methyl]-1-methylpyridinium) contains oxyme and cyclopentyl parts and is more toxic than oxyme-containing OPs from the training set.",

The PLS model showed a 65% accuracy for the prediction of test set compounds and the CRT model -74%. The results of these models have a considerable correspondence between each other that additionally confirmed their validity. It has been shown that, in general, a polymethylene chain comprising three or fewer CH 2 groups has a negative influence on affinity for 5-HT 1A R and a chain comprising four or more CH 2 groups has a positive influence. Electron-donating substituents (o-OCH 3 , o-OH, o-Cl) at the ortho-position of phenyl ring strongly promoted affinity. A 2,3-dihydrobenzodioxin-5-yl residue has a similar influence on affinity. Electron-accepting substituents (m-CF 3 ) in phenyl have high affinity. Electron-accepting substituents at the para-position of the phenyl ring (p-NO 2 , p-F) have a stronger negative influence on affinity to 5-HT 1A R than electron-donating ones (p-OCH 3 ). The following conclusions have been made about the influence of the terminal fragments (substituents of N-alkyl group) on affinity. Saturated polycyclic fragments and small aromatic residues demonstrated positive influence on affinity and larger aromatic fragments show a negative effect. According to the following analysis, the optimal van der Waals volume for the terminal moiety must be approximately 500 \u00c5 3 or less.",

            "text": "In summary, it can be concluded that the QSAR technology considered is a universal instrument for the development of effective QSAR models which provide reliable enough virtual screening and targeted molecular design of various compounds with desired properties. This is a result of its hierarchical structure and wide descriptor system. The comparative analysis of HiT QSAR with the most popular modern QSAR approaches reflects its advantage, especially in predictivity. The efficiency of HiT QSAR was demonstrated on various QSAR/QSPR tasks at different (1D-4D) levels of molecular modeling. HiT QSAR is under permanent development and improvement. Currently the system of descriptors devoted to adequate description of structure of nanomaterials on the basis of carbon polyhedrons (fullerenes, nanotubes, etc.), algorithms of consensus modeling, and procedures for QSAR analysis of complex mixtures are under development. The technology developed has been realized as a complex of computer programs \"HiT QSAR.\" The trial version is available on request for everyone who is interested in it.",
