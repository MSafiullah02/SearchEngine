To design the optimally protective breath, we must 1) consider the complex microanatomy of interconnected alveoli with shared alveolar walls, 2) consider the physiologic mechanisms of VILI in the microenvironment of the terminal air space (the alveoli and alveolar ducts), 3) consider the dynamic alveolar physiology (i.e., the dynamic change in alveolar size and shape during tidal ventilation) and how changes in dynamic alveolar physiology cause tissue damage resulting in VILI, and 4) apply this information to postulate an optimal mechanical breath profile (MBP), necessary to a ventilation protocol capable of blocking VILI. A mechanical breath comprises airway pressures, volumes, flows, rates, and the duration over which they are applied throughout inspiration and expiration. Critical consideration of VILI mechanisms and dynamic alveolar physiology can unveil MBP parameter combinations that are lung protective, thus enabling the practitioner to adjust protocols and minimize or avert VILI. Our approach is to identify an optimal combination of these physical parameters over the course of the ventilator cycle that is adaptive in real time to each individual breath.",

However, alveolar collapse and edema result in a heterogeneous inflation pattern such that the stress during cyclic volume change becomes concentrated onto the open lung tissue adjacent to collapsed tissue (18, 49; Fig. 2, A and B, and Supplemental Animation S2). It has been shown that the homogeneous lung is stable but local atelectasis, causing stress risers, can occur if alveolar surface tension is high and insensitive to alveolar surface area (57).",

Thus dynamic strain is minimal in normal alveoli (15, 16, 45). Loss of surfactant function with acute lung injury renders alveoli unstable, greatly reducing the alveolar collapse time constant, resulting in a rapid collapse of the alveolus with each expiration (58; Fig. 3, A and B, and Supplemental Animation S3). This leads to a large dynamic alveolar strain, which is known to be a primary VILI mechanism (1, 17). Pathologic changes in alveolar stability can be identified using a deep inflation (DI) and measuring the change in elastance (H) and hysteresivity (\u03b7). H and \u03b7 not returning to normal following a DI correlates strongly with alveolar instability viewed directly using in vivo microscopy (4). Stabilizing alveoli and preventing derecruitment with adequate PEEP, measured directly by in vivo microscopy, significantly reduce acute lung injury (58).",

            "text": "In a homogenous, stable lung, it is postulated that alveolar OD sufficient to cause VILI histopathology does not exist in the absence of S-R or R/D, unless extremely high airway pressures are delivered. We hypothesize that because of interdependence (Fig. 1), alveolar OD can only occur adjacent to collapsed or unstable alveoli (42, 55). Mead et al. demonstrated that the shared alveolar walls would be stretched in response to a single overdistended or collapsing alveolus (42). We have seen that loss of interdependence (i.e., collapse of 1 or more alveoli) can cause instability and OD of adjacent alveoli, using in vivo microscopy. Supplemental Animation S4 depicts how the collapse of a single \u201calveolus\u201d results in instability and OD of adjacent alveoli, stressing the importance of maintaining a fully recruited lung. Biotrauma occurs secondary to alveolar S-R- and R/D-induced tissue trauma causing a release of inflammatory mediators. Thus VILI will be minimized if both S-R and R/D are blocked. OD of a fully inflated lung can cause airways to rupture (e.g., pneumothorax) if sufficiently elevated yet does not cause lung histopathology typical of VILI (56). Alveolar ducts, rather than alveolar sacs, may be the site of OD and the possible site of airway rupture in a heterogeneously ventilated lung (36). In summary, VILI is minimized in an open and stable lung, even with high lung volumes and pressures. In summary, VILI has most often been viewed as an alteration of the barrier between the alveolar space and capillary, which is closely associated with an increase in inflammation (biotrauma). However, physical failure of the load-bearing cells and tissues during ventilation is now understood to also play a major role in VILI (60).",

It is well accepted that alveolar microanatomy is complex, with alveoli sharing walls in a honeycomb fashion forming a structurally stable design (Fig. 1; 42). Because of this alveolar interdependence and the fact that alveolar walls are only one or two cells thick (a vascular endothelial cell and an alveolar epithelial cell), it is proposed that that alveolar volume change is not simply stretching and contracting, similar to a rubber balloon, although this has never been directly proven, with the more likely mechanism being folding and unfolding like a paper bag (62). The three most logical mechanisms by which alveoli and alveolar ducts can change size during ventilation are as follows: 1) an all-or-none alveolar opening and closing during each breath, such that there are more open alveoli at inspiration than at expiration; 2) fluctuations in alveolar size owing to crumpling and uncrumpling of alveolar walls, similar to how a paper bag would change volume; and 3) change in the size of the alveolar duct with minimal change in alveolar size (26, 50).",

However, alveoli do not behave as an elastic structure, but rather as a viscoelastic system. A viscoelastic system would not exhibit an immediate change in alveolar size during tidal ventilation (10, 19, 31, 40, 59). The delay in strain following the applied force-induced stress is represented graphically as a hysteresis in the stress (\u03c3)-strain (\u03b5) curve. Direct visualization of the whole lung and subpleural alveoli during lung inflation has demonstrated this lag between the time that the Vt force delivers the stress until the time alveoli actually begin to expand or recruit (strain; Supplemental Movie S1; 3). Similar assessments of alveolar mechanics and stability have been previously published (61). Although in vivo microscopy is one of the few methods to measure the dynamic change in alveolar size during ventilation in real time, it must be remembered that subpleural alveoli are unique in that they are not totally surrounded by alveoli and thus they may inflate or deflate differently from the majority of alveoli that compose the lung. Also, measuring dynamic inflation and deflation of a single alveolus in an animal ARDS model demonstrated that there was no significant reduction in alveolar size until airway pressure fell from 13 to 6 mmHg (46). A second time lag would be generated by collapsed alveoli with different opening pressure/duration constants, such that for \u201cstickier\u201d alveoli, a higher pressure or longer duration at a pressure would be necessary for recruitment. This would generate a time lag from when the pressure was applied and when the alveolus was recruited. Thus time is a critical component in determining alveolar inflation and deflation during each mechanical breath.",

            "text": "The change in alveolar size with ventilation is complex and has been depicted as viscoelastic in nature. This viscoelasticity has been described on a molecular basis using a mathematical framework (20, 59). In this paper, we will use a very basic model to analyze viscoelastic behavior using a spring attached to a dash in a filled pot (Supplemental Animation S5). Using this model, the force, which in the case of the lung would be the pressure generated with the Vt, is applied to the tissue represented by the spring and dashpot. Supplemental Animation S5 shows that in response to this stress, in such a viscoelastic system the spring would move rapidly whereas there would be a significant delay and a much slower movement of the dashpot. Conversely, when the stress is released (expiratory phase of lung ventilation), the spring compresses rapidly followed by a slow reverse strain of the dashpot (Supplemental Animation S4). Using this spring-and-dashpot model to describe dynamic alveolar inflation, we can postulate that the rate of dashpot movement on both inspiration and expiration could be altered by lung pathology. For example, with loss of surfactant function during ARDS, collapsed alveoli would be very sticky (25), and thus it would take a great deal of stress over time to recruit them. This would be depicted by a very slowly moving dashpot. Once these surfactant-depleted alveoli open, they would be unstable and derecruit very rapidly during expiration (28), and this would be represented by a fast collapsing dashpot.",

Since the two primary mechanisms of VILI are alveolar R/D and S-R, a protective breath must be designed to prevent or treat both of these pathologies. Considering that alveoli are viscoelastic, we postulate that a mechanical breath with an extended inspiratory and short expiratory duration would recruit alveoli with each breath (Supplemental Animation S5), as well as prevent alveolar collapse during expiration (Supplemental Animation S6). This would minimize VILI by reducing both S-R and alveolar R/D (Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplemental Animations S2 and S3). Thus our protective mechanical breath strategy uses the component of time, in addition to the airway pressures, volumes, and flows being delivered with each breath, to block VILI. If lung volume increase were slow, the corresponding pressure would be near the elastic limit of the tissue. Higher ventilation rates would generate higher stresses exacerbating tissue injury, and if this were true, it would offer a second benefit of the extended inspiratory duration.",

This strategy is based on the knowledge that a significant volume of lung is either collapsed or edema filled and thus if a normal Vt were forced into this lung, the remaining normal lung tissue would be injured by overdistension. We showed evidence earlier that OD does not occur in the homogeneously ventilated lung, and thus it seems that a better strategy would be initially opening the lung, which would eliminate heterogeneous ventilation and stress risers (33, 43). PEEP would then be applied to keep the newly recruited alveoli open, eliminating the final mechanical mechanism of VILI, that of alveolar R/D. Indeed, this strategy of initially recruiting the ARDS lung has been shown to improve oxygenation and driving pressure without detrimental effects on mortality, ventilator-free days, or mortality in a pilot study (32). In that study a decremental PEEP trial was conducted as the pressure in the recruited lung was decreased in 2-cmH2O increments with the optimal PEEP identified by the best dynamic lung compliance (32). A meta-analysis has recently shown that this open lung approach significantly reduces the mortality in ARDS patients (38).",

            "text": "The open lung approach makes sound physiologic sense as a method to minimize the mechanisms of VILI at the alveolar level. Indeed, a link has been shown between optimal compliance/elastance and alveolar overdistension and instability in an animal model (6) and the role of driving pressure, which is calculated using compliance, as an indicator of mortality in ARDS patients (5). However, using compliance/elastance does not take advantage of the viscoelastic component of alveolar inflation and deflation. In theory, an extended time at inflation would progressively recruit alveoli, and a short time at expiration would prevent alveolar collapse. There are three US Food and Drug Administration-approved mechanical breath strategies that incorporate an extended inspiratory and minimal expiratory duration: 1) inverse inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E; 11, 43), 2) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV; 22, 66), and 3) airway pressure release ventilation (APRV; 27, 30). Relatively little study has been directed at inverse I:E in ARDS, and the results have been mixed (11, 43). HFOV has been extensively studied; however, recent work has shown that HFOV may increase mortality in ARDS patients (22, 65), although the reasons for this failure may not be due to the impact of HFOV on alveolar mechanics (41). The failure of HFOV to reduce mortality may be due to a misdistribution of ventilation in the heterogeneously injured lung (29). A very specific strategy of personalized APRV (30) has been shown to be effective at stabilizing alveoli (35, 36) and protecting from the development of ARDS in a clinically applicable porcine model (34, 51, 52). In a meta-analysis this personalized APRV strategy significantly reduced ARDS incidence and mortality in a surgical intensive care unit (8), but it has not been tested in a prospective clinical trial. It is also possible that a novel method of multifrequency oscillatory ventilation that would better personalize the HFOV breath to the patient\u2019s lung pathology would improve outcome (33).",

If these primary injury mechanisms are left untreated, they will result in a secondary mechanical mechanism of injury, alveolar overdistension. All three mechanical injuries cause inflammation resulting in biotrauma, which is the fourth component of the VILI tetrad. Logic dictates that if a mechanical breath can be applied that eliminates both of these primary VILI mechanisms, lung tissue damage would be significantly reduced. Thus the goal for protective mechanical ventilation is to open the lung and keep it open (37) or, if applied early, \u201cnever let the lung collapse.\u201d",

Alveolar inflation and deflation are viscoelastic, and thus there is a short but distinct time lag between the time that the force of airway pressure is delivered and the time that alveolar inflation occurs. Conversely, there is a distinct time lag between the point that stress is removed during lung deflation and when alveoli begin to collapse. In the acutely injured lung with loss of surfactant function, a longer time is required at inspiration to open alveoli and a much shorter time at expiration to prevent alveolar collapse.",
