In addition, according to ROC curve and Youden's index, the best diagnostic thresholds exist in A-IgM and C-IgG, and others are inconsistent with the manufacturer's declaration. The optimal threshold of A_IgG, B_IgM, C_IgM, D_Ab are less than the Cutoff value indicating more false positive results. The optimal threshold of C_IgM is greater than the Cutoff value, indicating more false negative cases. Therefore, the laboratory should conduct the necessary performance evaluation of the selected novel coronavirus antibody, carefully interpret the results of the novel coronavirus antibody, make the necessary further testing requirements, and reduce the missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.
