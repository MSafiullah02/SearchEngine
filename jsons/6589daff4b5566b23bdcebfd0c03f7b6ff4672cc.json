            "text": "Flattening-the-curve associated with reduced COVID-19 case fatality rates-an ecological analysis of 65 countries Dear Editor, Zhang et al., recently provided evidence in this journal that the timely supply of adequate medical resources can reduce COVID-19 related mortality 1 . They found that the case fatality rate was 4.5% in Wuhan (where the epidemic was most intense and hospitals overrun) compared to 0.5% in the rest of China where services were not as stretched 1 . Dramatic interventions to increase hospital capacity in Wuhan were associated with a subsequent decline in the case fatality rate in this city. 1 They and others have suggested that high COVID-19 mortality is partly related to hospital capacity being exceeded and as a result patients receiving suboptimal care. 2 A 'flattening the curve' approach has been advocated to prevent this from happening. [2] [3] [4] This refers to a combination of strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 which would in turn spread out the peak of the epidemic and prevent hospital capacity being overrun. 3 , 4 There has however been considerable heterogeneity in the extent to which countries have attempted to slow the spread of SARS CoV-2. 2 , 3 , 5 The United Kingdom, for example, initially favored encouraging the development of herd-immunity 5 .",

It is important to note that the estimates of the crude case fatality ratio can be biased upwards by under-reporting of cases and downwards by the failure to account for the delay from diagnosis to death. 6 , 7 We adjusted for the former and later via controlling for testing intensity and age of the epidemic, respectively. We acknowledge that this method is imperfect. We did not control for other variables such as the age structure and prevalence of comorbidity which may have influenced mortality. 6 Finally, we cannot be certain which component of the flatten-the-curve response was responsible for the reductions in case fatality. Despite these methodological weaknesses, this study provides further support for the concept that interventions that slow the spread of SARS CoV-2 will reduce case fatality rates.",
