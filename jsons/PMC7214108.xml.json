In our study, 18.4% of all patients received systemic glucocorticoids, and 76.9% of patients in the ICU received systemic glucocorticoids. Because \u201cseverity\u201d was not clearly defined in the Chinese study, it is difficult to compare findings. However, the high rate of use of glucocorticoids in our study can be explained by the fact that 84% of our ICU patients received invasive mechanical ventilation versus just 35.7% of the severe COVID-19 patients in the Chinese study. Wu, et al.13 reported that treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20\u20130.72) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ARDS. The use of glucocorticoids for COVID-19 is beneficial in certain groups of patients, although further investigation is needed to identify the subgroups that can benefit the most.",

Six patients (one ICU and five general ward patients) were transferred to other tertiary care hospitals because our medical resources were exhausted. All of the other patients are still in the hospital. Because our hospital is a tertiary care university hospital, with many patients requiring intensive care, the fatality rate is likely higher than the overall mortality rate in Korea. However, the fatality rate in our study was much lower than rates reported in three single-center studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China.1212 Since there will be additional deaths among patients who remain in the hospital, the final fatality rate is expected to increase.",

Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients in our study. Previous studies have demonstrated that increases in proinflammatory cytokine levels are associated with more severe disease in Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome patients. In patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, IL-6 and CXCL-10 levels were significantly higher in the severe disease group than in the mild group.14 In severe acute respiratory syndrome patients, the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3 were elevated.15 To prevent organ damage from cytokine release syndrome, it is imperative to develop a drug that targets these cytokines.",
