The PDCoV rRT-PCR design, comparison, sensitivity, and specificity are described in the Technical Appendix. We selected samples for PDCoV testing in accordance with veterinarians\u2019 requests to investigate the presence of PDCoV in pigs with diarrhea. The samples were homogenized and the RNA extracted by using previously described methods (6,7). Of 293 porcine samples tested, 89 (30%) were PDCoV positive; we did not detect transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in any samples tested (Table 1). Of the 89 PDCoV-positive samples, 20 samples (22% [11 fecal, 6 intestinal homogenate, 2 fecal swab, and 1 feed]) were negative for TGEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus A (RVA), rotavirus B (RVB), and rotavirus C (RVC); 69 (78%) PDCoV-positive samples were positive for PEDV, RVA, RVB, or RVC. Co-infection with PDCoV and RVC were most common (52 [58%] samples). Although most (27 [30%]) PDCoV co-infections were with only 1 viral pathogen, 15 (17%) were positive for PEDV, RVA, RVB, and RVC.",

We identified positive PDCoV in 20 (22%) samples that were negative for TGEV, PEDV, RVA, RVB, and RVC, but PDCoV co-infections were more common (69 [78%] samples), especially with RVC (52 [58%]). Although the samples from Canada were negative for PDCoV, the Animal Health Laboratory has confirmed that 6 Ontario farms contain PDCoV. Because we selected samples on the basis of clinical diarrhea and geographic location was limited, the results do not accurately reflect the prevalence of PDCoV in North America. In addition, the presence of PDCoV RNA in feed does not indicate infectivity of the virus. The prevalence of PDCoV in North America is unknown, and the new PDCoV rRT-PCR can be used to access the prevalence in the United States and Canada.",

An alternate hypothesis would indicate that PDCoV has been an undiagnosed pathogen of pigs in the United States and, like RVB, has been circulating there for an extended period (6) or that PDCoV might be a secondary infection to other enteric pathogens.
