Apart from being a potentially lethal condition, COVID-19 is also affecting health care strategies for other medical conditions. Ficarra et al [2] have made suggestions regarding urological surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the authors focused on all urological pathologies and reported information from Italy, a country that seemed to be the epicenter of the pandemic in Europe [2]. Therefore, we sought to obtain an up-to-date perspective on how the routine practice patterns of expert European endourologists changed (or adapted) during the COVID-19 pandemic via a survey. By focusing on expert experience coming from the field, we aimed to provide an algorithm to guide the management of urinary stone disease during this unprecedented time of extraordinary stress on the global endourology community.",

Some 34% of the respondents preferred spinal anesthesia instead of general anesthesia, whereas 17% continued with spinal anesthesia as used before the pandemic (Fig. 1C), possibly because of the well-known safety of spinal anesthesia in stone surgery [3].

More than 85% of the participants reported a decrease of >50% in the workload of outpatient clinics. Routine treatment protocols for stone management were reported as altered by 91.3% of the experts. Changes in routine treatment protocols were further investigated in the questionnaire for certain clinical situations. For management of stones of <2 cm and 2\u20133 cm in size, 31.9% and 27.6% of the participants, respectively, stated that they would prefer a conservative approach until the pandemic settles. In addition, approximately two-thirds stated that they would postpone any auxiliary procedure because of the COVID-19 pandemic and 51% stated that they would discharge patients on the same day or within 24 h postoperatively.",

            "text": "Another important aspect is emergency department admission of stone patients. Emergency physicians encounter stone patients with more severe conditions such as colic pain, acute renal failure, and pyelonephritis. The survey outlined that emergency department management of stone patients was also altered in more than 90% of cases during this period. Although the approach to stone patients in the emergency department was the same as before according to 6.4% of the experts, 55.3% began to accept cases from another COVID-19 area at the same emergency department, 25.5% accepted emergent urolithiasis cases in a newly organized space in the hospital, and 10.6% did not accept COVID-19 cases at all. Some 2% of the respondents referred emergent urolithiasis cases to other specialized COVID-19 centers. While timely management of these cases in the emergency department is crucial, clinical controversies arise if these patients are also suspicious for COVID-19. A possible scenario of a patient presenting to the emergency department with severe colic pain, fever, and cough would be a real dilemma for physicians. In the survey, nearly 90% of the participants stated that they would change the treatment strategy for an emergency case when the patient is positive for COVID-19. Therefore, clinical algorithms for cases presenting with renal obstruction, urinary tract infection, and acute renal failure would be helpful (Fig. 2\n). Changes in sterilization strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic were also included in the questionnaire: only 34.8% of the respondents did change their routine strategy for sterilization. This may be because of either a lack of knowledge on the risk of urine-based dissemination of viral RNA or a lack of modification of sterilization strategies in hospitals in the short time immediately after the first case report on COVID-19.",

When faced with such an unexpected situation, urologists, like other physicians, tend to use all of the resources available in their web-based environment, such as European Association of Urology COVID-19 resources for urologists, the American Urological Association coronavirus disease 2019 information center, and social media. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in the practice patterns of endourologists for the management of urinary stone disease. Given the risk of novel viral pandemics in the future, the endourology community should be aware of possible alterations in clinical practice. Clinical algorithms may serve as a useful guide in adapting to these changes in time and in managing patients with urinary calculi safely and successfully.",
