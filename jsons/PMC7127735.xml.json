            "text": "Modified nucleosides containing fluorine in the sugar moiety have attracted attention as antiviral and anticancer agents with therapeutic utility.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen has been associated with an enhancement of biological activity and increase of chemical and metabolic stability. Important factors in fluorine substitution are the comparable size of hydrogen and fluorine atoms, the strong electron withdrawing properties of fluorine relative to hydrogen, and the increased stability of the carbon\u2013fluorine bond compared to the carbon hydrogen bond. Due to their similar van der Waals radius, replacement of hydrogen by fluorine does not greatly affect the steric properties of a fluorine-containing molecule.9 Among fluorinated nucleosides, 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro-d-nucleosides have shown antiviral and antineoplastic activities.10, 11 Gemcitabine12, 13, 14 (2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032,2\u2032-difluorocytidine, Gemzar, Fig. 1\n) is a well-known drug widely used to treat ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers.15, 16, 17 Gemcitabine phosphates interfere directly with DNA replication and can inhibit ribonucleotide reductase.18, 19 Chu and co-workers have reported the synthesis and anti-HIV activities of some enantiomeric 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro-\u03b2-l-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleosides.20 None of the compounds showed any significant activities against HIV-1, HBV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and lack of appreciable toxicity in Vero, CEM, and PBM cells up to 100 \u03bcM, except for the adenine derivative which showed a moderate activity against HIV-1 in PBM cells (3.4 \u03bcM). Recently, we have described the synthesis of 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro-d-5-iodouridine as an intermediate for a 2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro derivative of FV-100, the most potent anti-varicella zoster (VZV) virus agent reported to date.21, 22\n",

The compounds did not show appreciable antiviral activity against a broad panel of RNA viruses. However, anti-DNA virus activity, in particular, anti-herpes virus activity was observed for several compounds, in particular the nucleoside derivatives 8 to 11 (Table 1, Table 2\n). Whereas no activity was observed for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), notable inhibitory activity was recorded for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (EC50: 12\u201333 \u03bcM), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (EC50: 5.8\u201350 \u03bcM) and in particular feline herpes virus (FHV) (EC50: 1.1 and 2.4 \u03bcM for 8 and 9, and 13 and 28 \u03bcM for 10 and 11). The preferential antiviral activity against herpes (HSV-1 and VZV) viruses and the decreased antiviral activity against HSV-2 and the TK-deficient HSV and VZV strains point to the virus-encoded thymidine kinase as the activating enzyme to afford eventual antiviral activity (Table 1\n). When evaluated for their inhibitory activity against [3H]dThd phosphorylation by purified recombinant HSV-1, VZV and FHV TK, compounds 8 to 11 were most inhibitory to HSV-1 TK-catalysed dThd phosphorylation, followed by VZV TK and FHV TK (Table 3\n). Thus, the compounds are endowed with a higher affinity for HSV-1 TK (and also VZV TK) than FHV TK. However, they were markedly more inhibitory to FHV than to HSV-1 and VZV replication in cell culture. This apparent contradiction may point to a preferential and better inhibition of the presumed antiviral target enzyme, DNA polymerase derived from FHV than the DNA polymerase derived from HSV-1 or VZV. Indeed, whereas virus-encoded TK acts as the activating (phosphorylating) enzyme, the DNA polymerase could be considered as the most likely target for the compounds after metabolic activation to their 5\u2032-triphosphate derivatives. The lower affinity for FHV TK than for HSV-1 and VZV TK but higher activity for FHV in cell culture than observed for HSV-1 and VZV in cell culture, is strongly suggestive for a superior affinity of the 5\u2032-triphosphate derivatives for FHV DNA polymerase than HSV-1/VZV DNA polymerase to explain the data. Alternatively, although somewhat less likely, the compounds may far better be phosphorylated in the FHV-infected feline cells than the HSV-1/VZV-infected human cells leading to a substantial accumulation of the 5\u2032-triphosphate metabolite in the feline but not the human cells. Direct affinity measurements of the 5\u2032-triphosphates with the herpes DNA polymerases and/or metabolic experiments with the test compounds in feline versus human cells should reveal which assumption is correct.",

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 cell culture infective dose-50 (CCID50) of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (200, 40, 8, \u2026 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105\n cells/ml) cells were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV-1(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/mL and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.",

After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for two (L1210, FM3A) or three (CEM, HeLa) days, the cell number was determined using a Coulter counter.

The samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min in the presence or absence of different concentrations (fivefold dilutions) of the test compounds. At this time point, the enzyme reaction still proceeded linearly. Aliquots of 45 \u03bcl of the reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman DE-81 filter paper disks (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The filters were washed three times for 5 min each in 1 mM ammonium formate, once for 1 min in water, and once for 5 min in ethanol. The radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting.",
