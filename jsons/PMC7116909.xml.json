            "text": "Bats (Order Chiroptera) are divided into two suborders, Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera (Springer, 2013). They are considered reservoirs of multiple infectious diseases and zoonotic pathogens (Calisher et al., 2006) and due to their broad distribution, social behavior and classification as the only mammals capable of sustained flight, have been implicated in the transmission of a range of microorganisms including rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), henipaviruses, ebola and pathogenic and non-pathogenic trypanosomes (Guyatt et al., 2003, Li et al., 2005, Halpin et al., 2000, Hamilton et al., 2012a, Hamilton et al., 2012b). Trypanosomes are blood-borne parasites, and while the majority of species appear to asymptomatically infect the host, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense are known to cause severe disease in humans and Trypanosoma cruzi causes severe disease in both humans and animals, resulting in very large economic losses worldwide (Thompson et al., 2014). Bats are among the most common hosts of a large variety of trypanosomes in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe (Hoare, 1972, Baker, 1973, Marinkelle, 1976, Marinkelle, 1979, Gardner and Molyneux, 1988a, Gardner and Molyneux, 1988b, Molyneux, 1991, Hamanaka and Pinto Ada, 1993, Steindel et al., 1998, Grisard et al., 2003, Barnabe et al., 2003, Lisboa et al., 2008, Cottontail et al., 2009, Maia da Silva et al., 2009, Cavazzana et al., 2010, Garc\u00eda et al., 2012, Hamilton et al., 2012a, Hamilton et al., 2012b, Lima et al., 2012, Pinto et al., 2012, Lima et al., 2013, Marcili et al., 2013, Silva-Iturriza et al., 2013, Cottontail et al., 2014, Ram\u00edrez et al., 2014). However, knowledge of the genetic diversity, hosts, vectors, life-cycles, pathology, distribution and phylogenetic relationships of trypanosome species infecting bats is restricted to a few species.",

Within the pteropids, black flying-fox (P. alecto) (n\n = 5) and little red flying-fox (P. scapulatus) (n\n = 7), blood and heart tissues were obtained from the Kimberley region of Western Australia. These bats were euthanased by local veterinary officers following reports of neurological disease, or interaction with members of the public resulting in bites or scratches. The carcasses were then necropsied in biological safety cabinets; the brain tissue sent to the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratories (for Australian bat lyssavirus testing), and the remaining tissues stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Blood samples from microbats were sampled at the request of local wildlife carers as part of routine veterinary investigation. Two species were screened; Gould\u2019s wattled bats (Chalinolobus gouldii) (n\n = 9) and a lesser long-eared bat (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) (n\n = 1). All microbats were from the outer Perth metropolitan area and had been taken to carers as a result of habitat loss or suspected misadventure. Bats were anaesthetized with isoflurane and approximately 12 \u03bcl of blood was drawn from a blood vessel in the uropatagium (wing membrane vein) using a 26 gauge needle, before immediately being diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffered saline.",

T. pteropi, first described by Breinl (1913) in flying-foxes (Pteropus gouldii), represented a slender trypanosome with a long pointed posterior end, which had an under-developed undulating membrane and a long free flagellum. The original measurements by Breinl (1913) for total length was between 20 and 22 \u03bcm, 2.5\u20133.0 \u03bcm in breadth, 2.5\u20133.0 \u03bcm from the posterior to the kinetoplast and 11\u201312 \u03bcm in free flagellum. Mackerras (1959) later described trypanosomes isolated from a flying-fox (Pteropus sp.) as morphologically similar to T. pteropi, however they were slightly smaller with a sharply pointed anterior end and measured 18\u201320 \u03bcm in total length, 2\u20134 \u03bcm in breadth, 1.5\u20134 \u03bcm from the posterior end to the kinetoplast, 4\u20135 \u03bcm from the kinetoplast to the nucleus with the free flagellum measuring 8\u201310 \u03bcm (Mackerras, 1959).

The overlap in size between T. hipposideri and T. vegrandis suggests that these may be the same species. However, in contrast to T. hipposideri, the trypanosomes identified in bats in the present study generally lacked a clearly defined kinetoplast and nucleated region. Unfortunately genetic sequences from T. pteropi and T. hipposideri are not available and therefore cannot be compared genetically with T. vegrandis. T. vegrandis was first described in woylies as a small curved trypanosome with a pointed posterior and an anterior nucleus in which the kinetoplast is closely situated. In woylies, T. vegrandis measured 6.9\u201310.5 \u03bcm in total length (mean 8.3 \u03bcm), (1.0\u20131.6 \u03bcm in breadth (mean 1.3 \u03bcm), with a free flagellum length of 1.2\u20132.8 \u03bcm (mean 1.8 \u03bcm), a posterior to kinetoplast length of 2.7\u20133.8 \u03bcm (mean 3.3 \u03bcm), a kinetoplast to nucleus length of 0.8\u20131.9 \u03bcm (mean 1.2 \u03bcm) and a nucleus to anterior length of 1.5\u20133.2 \u03bcm (mean N 2.1 \u03bcm) (Thompson et al., 2013). In the present study, the mean total length (9.0 \u03bcm) and mean free flagellum length (2.6 \u03bcm) of the bat isolates are morphologically similar to T. vegrandis from woylies. Only one bat isolate was observed with a defined kinetoplast and nuclear region and similar to the woylie isolates, contain an anterior nucleus with a kinetopast situated adjacently. For this bat isolate, the posterior to kinetoplast length (6.7 \u03bcm) and total length (13.8 \u03bcm) were larger compared to the woylie isolates, yet smaller in kinetoplast to nucleus (0.7 \u03bcm) and nucleus to anterior (0.8 \u03bcm).",

Trypanosomes have few morphological features detectable using light microscopy, which can adequately delimit species (Gibson, 2009) and the very small size of T. vegrandis (8.3 \u03bcm in length and 1.3 \u03bcm in width), renders this even more difficult. In the present study, morphological analysis was also limited due to the low levels of true blood stream trypomastigotes. This may have been due to the life-cycle phase at the time of sampling. Typically trypanosomes within the vertebrate host exhibit T. cruzi-like multiplication, with division taking place in the amastigote stage, followed by epimastigote forms that later develop into trypomastigote blood stream stages (Hoare, 1972). The small trypanosome stages observed in the bat blood (Fig. 1B\u2013D) may represent epimastigote or transitional forms, while the more defined trypanosome (Fig. 1A) may represent the true blood stream life-cycle. Additional research however is required to understand the life-cycle stages of T. vegrandis.",

Previous studies have reported a prevalence of 20% (0.0\u201340.2% 95CI) in woylies (Paparini et al., 2011) and up to 32% (27.1\u201336.6% 95CI) in various other marsupial species (Botero et al., 2013). The very high prevalence of T. vegrandis in Australian bats suggests that bats may be the primary host for T. vegrandis, however further research is required to confirm this. In other countries, a range of both zoonotic and bat-specific trypanosome species have been identified in bats. For example, studies in Colombian and Brazilian bats have reported trypanosome prevalences of 2.4\u201380% using microscopy (D'Alessandro et al., 1971, Marinkelle, 1972, Marinkelle, 1976). Molecular studies have identified a trypanosome prevalence of 61.2% (53.6\u201368.5% 95CI) in bats in Colombia (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2014) and 11.6% (7.7\u201316.6% 95CI) in Panamian bats (Pinto et al., 2012). Recently a novel trypanosome was identified in the blood of an adult female little red flying-fox (P. scapulatus) from south-eastern Queensland (Mackie et al., 2015). The novel trypanosome was most similar to T. rangeli and T. minasense (1% genetic distance at the 18S rRNA locus and 14\u201315% at the gGAPDH locus respectively) (Mackie et al., 2015).",

However the high prevalence of T. vegrandis in the present study suggests that bats may play an important role in the epidemiology of T. vegrandis in Australia. The impact of T. vegrandis on bat and marsupial health is currently unknown, but mixed T. vegrandis and Trypanosoma copemani co-infections were found more frequently in declining compared to stable woylie populations (p = 0.001) (Botero et al., 2013). All of the flying-foxes in the present study were clinically infected with Australian bat lyssavirus, and the microbats were from a wildlife care facility and so may be viewed as a population under a degree of stress. Further studies are essential to better understand the clinical significance of T. vegrandis, particularly in populations subject to stress from environmental factors or infectious agents, which may lead to expression of trypanosome-associated disease or increased shedding of the organism.",
