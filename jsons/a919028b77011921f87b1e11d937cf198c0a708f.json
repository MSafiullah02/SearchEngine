Coronaviruses are associated with comorbidities, along with the symptoms of it. SARS-CoV-2 is one of the highly pathogenic coronaviruses that causes a high death rate compared to the SARS-CoV and MERS. In this review, we focused on the mechanism of coronavirus with comorbidities and impairment in multi-organ function. The main dysfunction upon coronavirus infection is damage to alveolar and acute respiratory failure. It is associated with the other organ damagesuch as cardiovascular risk via an increased level of hypertension through ACE2, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risks such as chemosis, conjunctivitis, and conjunctival hyperemia, cancer risk, venous thromboembolism, tuberculosis, aging, and cardiovascular dysfunction and reproductive risk.",

A case was reported where a 39 years old doctor who got infected with SARS-CoV exhibited usual symptoms and was hospitalized. After hospitalization, he was presented with eyesight problems and later started exhibiting central nervous system symptoms such as delirium and restlessness. After a month, he passed away. When his brain tissue was examined, this revealed the presence of SARS-CoV virus. The doctors reported that he might have got infected while treating the patients, and also the chemotactic attraction of immune cells by the infected brain cells might have injured the brain more than that of the viral infection. The chemotactic attraction was characterized by the presence of a chemokine called monokine induced by gamma interferon (Mig) found in the patient's brain and the bloodstream [54] (represented in table 1).",

Apart from these liver serum enzymes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the similarity in making an entry into the host cell through the ACE2 receptor. In addition to the type 2 cells in the lungs, both the bile duct cells and hepatocytes also express ACE2, which might be the reason that liver injury occurs during SARS-CoV-2 infection [103] .The bile duct epithelial cells are involved in immune responses and the regeneration of the hepatocytes [104] . Besides possessing a high number of ACE2 on its surface, bile duct cells are more prone to the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in liver injury, which indicates that the hepatocytes are not directly involved in the hepatic injury [37] . The histopathological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients revealed mild lobular and portal activity and restrained microvascular steatosis [105] .The degree of liver damage is directly proportional to the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Still, the reason for the liver injury remains elusive. A recent study reported that the use of anti-viral medication lopinavir might result in hepatic damage [102] .Therefore, whether the liver injury is due to the virus entry or due to the drugs used as anti-viral medication needs to be elucidated.",

Another drug combination, which includeslopinavir and ritonavir, had no invitro evidence for COVID-19. Also, the clinical trials are being carried out on malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (represented in table 2). Some scientists say that these drugs are not recommendable against SARS-CoV-2. Since there are no scientific proofs available and it might be harmful, leading to heart arrhythmia.",

In the case of severely affected individuals, hyperactivation of immune cells leads to the cytokine storm, which is created upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in the inflammation at the targeted tissues. Therefore, inhibiting the pro-inflammatory candidates might be a potential therapeutic option to treat COVID-19 [148] . Anti-TNF therapy was approved and has been utilized for 20 years as a promising option to treat autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease [149] . TNF is the key enhancer of inflammation and also present in the blood of COVID-19 severely affected patients [150] . Therefore, prescribing anti-TNF therapy may help to prevent the aggression of the infection. It has been reported that patients with inflammatory bowel disease contracted with COVID-19. One hundred sixteen patients were on anti-TNF therapy, of whom 99 recovered, and only one patient died. Therefore, the usage of anti-TNF therapy may stand as a promising therapy to prevent the progression of the viral infection by inhibiting the key pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF [148] .",

ACE2 exists as both membranous forms, which are found to be anchored to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f plasma membrane and the soluble form, circulating in the bloodstream but at a lower proportion [151, 152] . Besides serving as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2, the higher levels of ACE2 are required by the hypertension patient to reduce the blood pressure. Therefore, the ACE2 levels need to be maintained besides inhibiting the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the usage of human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) which exhibited positive results in the phase I and phased II clinical trials to elevate the soluble form of ACE2that competes with the membranous ACE2 for binding with SARS-CoV-2 and inhibits the viral entry and replication can be considered as a therapeutic option to treat COVID-19. Besides inhibiting the viral entry, it also sustains the ACE2 levels required for the degradation of Ang II [153, 154] .",

This damage is in a diverse range; in the alveoli, there is a hardened tissue with the dense clumps which block the vessels in the tiny air sacs, which absorb the oxygen and cause tissue lesions. This tissue lesion acts as a sign of the long term lung disease. Similar reports have been found in both the SARS CoV and MERS. The patients admitted with lung pneumonia shows damage in both the lungs. The CT scan of the COVID-19 patients indicates that there is a tissue lesion found over the alveoli and which can develop into the scars. There are more than 2.9 million people have COVID-19 disease worldwide, according to April 27. 80% of the patients are having a high risk of problems, such as from breathing to respiratory failure[107]. invasion by the virus, therapeutic care must be taken to prevent the viral entry into the central nervous system (CNS)[7].6.8. SARS-CoV-2 -ImmunopathologySARS-CoV-2 infection mediates immune response, both innate and adaptive. The enhanced level of the innate response and decreased level of adaptive causes tissue damage. Upon viral infection, there is an immune response. T cells, especially the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) and a group of differentiation 8 (CD8+), have an anti-viral role. CD8+ T cells are highly cytotoxic, and they killed infected cells. This T cell induces the pro-inflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling. This process further activates the cytokines and chemokines [7]. Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the immune effector cells are also having the enhanced level of the cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-12, TGF\u03b2, IL-33 and TNF-\u03b1 and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL8. Similar to this, severe MERS-CoV infected patient's serum shows an increased level of the cytokines and chemokines. This cytokine storm further causes multiple organ failures to further leads to the death of the SARS-CoV-2 patient [109].",

And 44 out of 407 exhibited a higher risk for bleeding. In these patients, the mechanical compressions such as intermittent pneumatic compression and elastic compression stockings are instructed, and the duration and dosage of anticoagulants should be adjusted. Also, the COVID-19 patients, along with other co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular manifestations, respiratory failure, renal and hepatic problems, can affect the bleeding status and venous thromboembolism.

This process activates the signaling pathway, such as the NF-kB pathway, via TRIF. The interaction between the cells and the virus activates many cytokine storms. On the other hand, once the virus enters into the cell, the antigen present in that would undergo the antigen presentation cells (APC); further, this stimulates the humoral and cellular immunity. COVID-19 infects the macrophage cells, which presents to the T cell, further, which leads to the activation, differentiation of T-cells, along with the production of cytokines.
