The current emergency requires all possible efforts to stem the spread of the virus. In this context, it is clear that we have the urgent need to rely upon etiopathogenetic data, in order to do all possible efforts to block the epidemic. However, observing the trend of the infections in China and the geographic areas of the main outbreaks, it could be hypothesized that air pollution plays a role. In particular, it has been previously demonstrated, in specific populations, a role of particulate matter in worsening clinical presentation of virus infection in airways. Without prejudice to the ascertained virus spread by air droplets or contaminated surfaces, the factors that could have favored its spread remain to be investigated. Moreover, if these observations were to be confirmed, when the health emergency is resolved, it will be mandatory to redesign an economic-productive model in balance with the environment.",

Undoubtedly, smokers have been identified as a highrisk category and more prone and susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (Seys, 2018) , probably due to both dipeptidyl peptidase-4 mRNA and protein overexpression, inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters. More recent data on SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) pointed out that the oxidative stress could alter the pulmonary air-blood barrier, thus creating a substrate for a more serious acute respiratory distress syndrome in smokers (Cai, 2020) .",

            "text": "Besides the smoking habits, air pollutants' exposure might play a pivotal role. Indeed, air pollution is responsible for between 3 and 7 million deaths worldwide per year, and it still represents a serious public health issue due to increasing industrialization and the rapid expansion of urban environments. (Niemann, 2017) . Particularly, the urban pollution is a complex cocktail of chemicals which is broadly characterized into gases, semi-volatile liquids, and particles. During the last few years, many reports dealing with this topic have been published. In a relatively recent study, conducted in Lombardy (Carugno, 2016) , it has been shown that some pollutants are associated to an increased risk of complications and hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis (RSV) (Carugno, 2016) . The same study found a close association between shortand medium-term particulate matter 10 (PM-10) exposures and increased risk of hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis among infants. These data strengthened another report by Ye Q. and colleagues (Ye, 2016) where it has been demonstrated that air pollutants significantly increase the risk of RSV infection with dosage, lag, and cumulative effects. Similarly, Carugno et al. have previously demonstrated the dangerous exposition of the Northern Italy population to air pollutants (Carugno, 2018) ; in their study, they described the shortterm effects of PM-10 and NO 2 exposure in Lombardy, where increasing concentrations of air pollution were associated with increased mortality and hospital admissions. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the prolonged cellular oxidative stress induced by the inhaled pollutants should be considered a predisposing condition for the severe impact of respiratory viruses on respiratory system. In such a context, it might be conceivable that some air pollutants, specifically of PM-2.5 and PM-10, might favor not only the virus pathogenicity but also its spread. Indeed, as it survives for several hours, even days, on inert surfaces (Van Doremalen, 2020), it could be hypothesized that particular atmospheric conditions constitute further facilitate of diffusion. Supporting the abovementioned hypothesis, the empirical observation that geographical areas with very high levels of pollutants in the air, such as Hubei region in China and Northern Italy, are also those with the highest number of infected and, consequently, of deaths. The rigid measures undertaken in China have resulted in a drastic reduction of contagions by inter-human contact; however, it is conceivable that the reduction of pollutants, consequent to the stop of industrial production and human activities, may have guaranteed a further reduction in the spread of contagion. In fact, during the quarantine, established by governments, the concentrations of pollutants were measured by the satellites of the European Space Agency, and the results have been compared with the concentrations detected in the same period of the last year and in the period before the quarantine, finding a significant reduction in the concentrations of pollutants (McMahon, 2020 , Bartels, 2020 .",
