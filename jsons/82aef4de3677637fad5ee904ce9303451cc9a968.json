The experiment was conducted to examine effects of mannan oligosaccharide (Actigen; ACT) on growth performance and serum concentrations of antibodies and infl ammatory mediators in weanling pigs (Sus scrofa) experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). A total of 32 PRRSV-negative pigs (3 wk old) were randomly assigned from within blocks to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement [2 types of diet: control (0%) and ACT addition (0.04%); and with and without PRRSV] in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were blocked by initial BW within sex. Ancestry was equalized across treatments. Pigs (8/treatment) were kept individually in each pen. After 2 wk of an 8-wk period of feeding the treatments, pigs received an intranasal inoculation of PRRSV or sham medium at 5 wk of age. Infection by PRRSV decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F throughout the experiment (P < 0.01). Actigen did not affect ADG (P = 0.450), but decreased (P = 0.047) ADFI from 28 to 42 days postinoculation (DPI).

Activation of the immune system by PRRSV triggers secretions of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 that are most responsible for fever. Mild but prolonged fever is often a typical response to infections of a North American PRRSV strain.

This implies that feeding ACT might have induced changes in physiological and metabolic processes, which would contribute to the adjustment of body temperature.

In our experiment, the increased anti-PRRSV antibody response induced by ACT at 35 DPI may importantly contribute to the protection against PRRSV infection. The appearance of neutralizing antibodies is slow and lasts for only a few months, but good correlations between the appearance of neutralizing antibodies and clearance or prevention of viremia have been reported (Yoon et al., 1996; Osorio et al., 2002; Lopez and Osorio, 2004) . Although no clear effect of ACT on viremia was observed, ACT enhanced the adaptive immune response at the time which neutralizing antibodies are expected to appear in the circulation and consequently may confer a certain degree of protection. During this period, the improved G:F observed in infected pigs consuming ACT is likely to be associated with the increased antibody titer and numerically less ADFI.

Indeed, IL-1\u03b2 is capable of promoting T-cell proliferation and B-cell maturation and multiplication.

Among these cytokines, infected pigs fed ACT had a greater IL-12 concentration than those fed the control. During infection, IL-12 enhances the killing activity of natural killer cells and induces IFN-\u03b3 production in natural killer and T cells (Watford et al., 2003) . Also, IL-12 plays a critical role in development of naive T cells to IFN-\u03b3-secreting Th1 cells, which participate in cellular immunity (Holscher, 2004) . Although ACT enhanced IL-12 in infected pigs, it did not affect the serum IFN-\u03b3 concentration. This suggests that there are multiple components of the im-mune system, apart from IL-12, infl uencing the activation of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells as well as production and release of IFN-\u03b3 into peripheral blood. Indeed, IFN-\u03b3 production is mediated via IL-18 and produced by different types of immune cells involved in not only early innate response but also the subsequent antigen-specifi c adaptive immunity (Nakanishi et al., 2001; Schroder et al., 2004) . Consistent with earlier reports (Wesley et al., 2006; Loving et al., 2008) , our results indicated that IFN-\u03b3 was detectable soon after PRRSV infection and its serum concentration was low, but continued to be elevated for a couple of weeks postinfection.

These data indicate the involvement of this cytokine in regulation of infl ammation during acute and chronic phase responses.

Increased concentrations of IL-10 and Hp occurred later than the innate and Th1-associated cytokines. The IL-10 and Hp concentrations declined toward the end of the experiment, implying that the infl ammatory process seems to be repressed. The increase in IL-10 of infected pigs may be dependent on the infl ammation intensity caused by PRRSV. Che et al. (2011) found elevated concentrations of IL-10 at 7 DPI. In another study, serum IL-10 increased at 33 DPI, peaked at 38 DPI, and diminished to the pre-infection concentrations (Wang et al., 2011) . Interleukin-10 is secreted to suppress infl ammation through blocking activation of immune cells and synthesis of pro-infl ammatory cytokines (Ouyang et al., 2011) . It is also capable of stimulating B cell maturation and antibody production. Consequently, production of IL-10 and other anti-infl ammatory molecules is essential to regulate a harmony between protection and immunopathology. Increased IL-10 and PRRSV-specifi c antibodies, accompanied by decreased IL-12, after acute phase suggest that ACT aids in shifting from Th1 to T helper 2 (Th2) immune responses toward the end of the experiment. In addition, Hp, a type-2 acute phase protein has a strong response to PRRSV and often remains increased for several weeks postinfection before returning to normal (Parra et al., 2006; Gnanandarajah et al., 2008) . Cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 induce hepatocyte-produced Hp. The rise of Hp appears to coincide with the increased IL-10. Acute phase proteins including Hp may provide a feedback mechanism by suppressing pro-infl ammatory cytokine production (Petersen et al., 2004) .
