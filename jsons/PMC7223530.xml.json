            "text": "The majority of hospital admissions now come through the Emergency Department (ED) [1] and Emergency Medicine physicians usually provide the initial clinical determination of the appropriate destination for these patients. Misidentification of illness severity may lead to patients being admitted to an acute care unit then unexpectedly transferring to an ICU as their condition deteriorates [2]. While early unexpected ward-to-ICU transfers of ED admissions are infrequent (around 3% at 12 h post-admission) [3], these events result in an increased need for ventilator support [4], increased in-hospital and 30-day mortality [5\u20137], and prolonged length-of-stay (LOS) [5, 8]. The rates of ED floor admissions with early ICU transfer has been proposed as a quality metric because of these worsened outcomes [9, 10]. For these reasons, methods for identification of the trajectory of patients prior to admission and determining the appropriate level of care is important.",

The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provides guidelines which rely primarily on need for specific resources (i.e., mechanical ventilation or vasopressor requirements) [11]. As such, outside of these clear indications for ICU care, the decision to admit to a floor ward versus ICU is based on the patient\u2019s perceived stability and consideration of other, often less clear, social and clinical determinants [12]. Early warning scores (EWS) exist for identifying acute and intensive care patients at risk for decompensation: CURB-65 predicts mortality due to pneumonia [13]; sequential organ failure score (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA) scores predict mortality due sepsis [14]; and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores predict in hospital mortality at ICU admission [15]. It is unclear how well these scores predict unexpected ward-to-ICU transfers. While some previous studies have developed models for predicting unexpected ICU transfers, these studies are limited to patients presenting with specific disease entities [16], do not take advantage of vital sign and laboratory data [17, 18], and do not differentiate time of ward-to-ICU transfer after admission [18, 19].",

This early intervention may avert later clinical deterioration, improving patient outcomes. It has been previously shown that patients with \u201cborderline\u201d ICU admission criteria for pneumonia have better outcomes when admitted to the ICU [12]. Given this, the development of an predictive model to help identify patients at risk for unexpected ward-to-ICU transfer is warranted. Such a tool should utilize available information, provide the flexibility to handle missing information, and provide real-time analysis based on updated data. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive analytic tool to identify ED patients at risk for decompensation within 24 h following acute care admission. The long-term goal of this approach would be to provide real-time risk assessment for clinical decision support to physicians and aid determination of appropriate disposition.",

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, SOFA and qSOFA are designed to identify patients with suspected infection at high risk for poor outcomes [14, 24, 25]. Frost et al. present a risk model for early ICU transfer [18]. The APACHE II score [26] identifies patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality [15]. The laboratory-based acute physiology score (LAPS) identifies patients at risk for early ICU transfer [27]. We calculated these scores based on data available in the ED prior to admission to acute care, and used the last score measured during the ED stay. For APACHE we were unable to determine chronic organ insufficiency and immunocompromise. For LAPS we were not able to identify high risk patients for whom different imputations should be used because the laboratory score preliminary model was not available [27].",

Only the last values available prior to admission were used for modeling. All modeling was performed in R [28] using the rms package [29]. We constructed a binary logistic regression model to identify patients at risk for early transfer. We first removed, blinded to the outcome, the most predictable features correlated more than R2 of 0.9 with other features. Missing values were imputed with median of all available values. Next, we built a model with all remaining features and removed features using fast backward elimination [30]. Another model was built with restricted cubic spline transformations using three knots of nonlinearity on each feature with enough unique values. The model (linear or non-linear) with the highest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was retained. We performed tenfold cross-validation with fast backward elimination to ensure unbiased feature selected, removing features eliminated and retraining the model. Finally, we calculated the predicted risk using leave-one-out cross validation [31]. Briefly, the first hospital admission was identified as index admission, and we built a model on the remaining N-1 admissions. The predicted risk for the index admission was estimated using this model, and the procedure repeated for each of N admissions. In this way risk estimates for each admission were out-of-sample.",

The most important feature is high heart rate, followed by need for supplemental oxygen, longer boarding time, and abnormal sodium. The qSOFA and CURB65 scores were also selected for the model. Time series of predicted risk leading up to the time of admission is shown in Fig. 1b. Risk estimates are shown in risk relative to average risk of early ICU transfer. That is, 1.0 represents the average risk, 2.0 is twice the average risk, and so on. White points indicate that risk estimates are significantly higher than risk estimates for the same patients 3 h prior. Risk estimates for admits with early ICU transfer (solid) are significantly higher than risk estimates for control patients, and rise from about twice the average risk to three times the average during their stay in the ED. The risk is significant beginning about 6 h prior to inpatient admission. Figure 1c shows the density of risk estimates for patients with (solid) and without (dashed) early ICU transfer. Figure 1d shows the predicted versus observed risk of early ICU transfer for deciles of predicted risk. Better calibrated models are closer to the line of identity, and better discriminating models have larger separation between deciles. The risk model is well calibrated in the middle 80% of predicted risk, overestimates risk for high risk patients, and underestimates risk for low risk patients. The model has good discrimination: the observed risk of admits with the highest decile of predicted risk is 7.9-fold (95% CI 5.0\u201312.9) higher than admits in the lowest decile of predicted risk.",

Our model demonstrated the ability to identify patients at risk for ward-to-ICU transfers. If implemented, our model would allow an alert to be activated prior to admission for the subset of patients at high risk for transfer to an ICU. Implementation would result in fewer than 2 such alerts per week, which is important to prevent alarm fatigue.

Additionally, in a previous analysis where point of care clinicians were interviewed and observed following implementation of continuous predictive analytics in the ICU, they noted that the analytics were viewed as a key piece of clinical information once adopted into workflow through routine documentation, reported as a risk score during patient rounds and handoffs of care [37].",

To date, there has not been a similar analysis conducted in an ED setting where the patient ratios, clinical presentations, and workflow patterns are very different than other environments. Due to the relative rarity but clinical relevance of the event of interest, it would be critical to incorporate implementation and study of continuous predictive analytics within existing clinical decision support frameworks. Specifically, alert risk thresholds could be established to aid providers in making the initial decision for floor versus ICU admit. Beyond the initial disposition decision, this score could be communicated to the oncoming admission team to guide management decisions early in the post-admit trajectory (e.g., through more frequent vital sign ascertainment or early attending assessment). Additionally, such a tool may assist task-saturated physicians in a supervisory role to appropriately triage attention to patients at higher risk of clinical decompensation. In order to impact distal patient outcomes of unintended ICU/IMU upgrade, technologies must move from passive surveillance to integrated clinical decision support [38].",

The relative rarity of these events makes them difficult to predict. The rate of these early ICU transfer in our study population was 1.2%, which is on the lower end of the range seen in similar studies (1.2\u20134%) [18, 39]. Despite the low rate of these events, they are associated with significantly worsened outcomes.

The most important features were high heart rate, need for supplementary oxygen, longer time boarding in the ED, and abnormal sodium. Existing EWS were incorporated into the model: qSOFA, an aggregate of vital signs (respiratory rate, Glasgow coma scale, and blood pressure) and CURB65 (age, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and higher urea nitrogen levels). Low calcium and the clinical decision to draw a troponin (irrespective of result) were also selected as features. This means that incorporating the latest vital sign and laboratory information into real-time prediction is essential to creating an accurate model of patient risk. Better identification of high-risk patients in the ED might lead to earlier or more targeted treatment, may prompt direction admission to the ICU, and could reduce early ICU transfer and the associated poorer outcomes.",

Models may need to be tuned for a specific institution with a different population or with different clinical protocols. Our study was also limited by not incorporating continuous data from cardiorespiratory bedside monitors. Our results indicate that current patient state is important. Continuous cardiorespiratory dynamics provide the highest resolution look at patient physiology and would provide additional relevant information [40]. Additionally, the reason for upgrade to ICU-level care was not readily available in our dataset. While such information would help provide a more robust framework in which to interpret of the results, we believe the presence of meaningful markers of deterioration in the event population serves as an effective proxy for appropriateness of ICU transfer. We also recognize that there are other non-clinical features that may influence the decision to admit a patient to either the acute care or ICU following an ED visit, including bed availability, local practice patterns, and nurse staffing considerations [11]. Future study involving a multi-center or prospective design could offset some of this variability and provide more robust, granular data.",
