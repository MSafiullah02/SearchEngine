            "text": "Sialic acids are a family of nine-carbon sugars that are typically found at the terminal end of glycan chains on the cell surface and secreted molecules in the deuterostome lineage of animals Schauer 2000 ; Varki 2007 ) (Fig. 8.1a ). The two most common forms of sialic acid are N -acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N -glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and Neu5Gc is enzymatically produced from Neu5Ac by adding a single oxygen atom (i.e., hydroxylation) ( Fig. 8.1b ) . A third sialic acid, 2-keto-3 deoxynonulosonic acid (Kdn), is known but is less common in mammals. The amino group can also be rarely remained unmodifi ed (Neu) and is regarded as a fourth sialic acid. These four forms of sialic acids can be further modifi ed in various ways, and this diversity is increased by attachments to the underlying sugar chains by different linkages ( a 2-3, a 2-6, and a 2-8) Beyer et al. 1979 ; Traving and Schauer 1998 ) . This diversity as presented on the cell surface and secreted molecules has been termed the \"sialome\" .",

            "text": "Sialic acids are synthesized from certain precursor molecules or recycled from glycoconjugates located on the cell surface ( Fig. 8.2 ). They can also be taken up from external sources and metabolically incorporated. The activation of free sialic acid to nucleotide donors (CMP-Neu5Ac, CMP-Neu5Gc, and CMP-Kdn) occurs in the nucleus, and nucleotide donors are then returned to the cytosol for transport into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi, sialic acid residues are transferred from the CMP donors to newly synthesized glycoconjugates. Finally, sialic acidcontaining glycoconjugates are transported to the cell surface, or secreted. Sialic acids on cell surfaces are often recognized by intrinsic and extrinsic molecules and play an important role in cell-cell communication and host-pathogen interaction. The intrinsic recognition is widely involved in many processes including the immune and nervous systems (Varki 2007 ) . Elimination of sialic acid production results in embryonic lethality (Schwarzkopf et al. 2002 ) . On the other hand, several pathogens use sialic acid recognition to initiate their infection . More than 55 vertebrate genes are involved in these biochemical and biological processes (Altheide et al. 2006 ) (Fig. 8.2 ) . A surprisingly large number of these have undergone genomic sequence, expression, or function changes uniquely in the human lineage.",

The sequencing of the euchromatic region of the human genome was completed in 2004 (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004 ) . Following these landmarks, a great deal of effort was made in the genome sequencing projects of non-human primates. This effort resulted in the release of the draft sequences of chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) and rhesus monkey The two most common forms of sialic acids. The only difference between these two forms is the additional oxygen atom in the N -glycolylgroup of Neu5Gc ( arrow ). Numbers represent the serial numbers of the nine-carbon backbone. These sialic acids share various a -glycosidic linkages ( a 2-3, a 2-6, and a 2-8) to the underlying sugar chain ( R ) from the C2 position.

Following these genomic achievements, post-genome biology, in which transcriptome, proteome, and glycome are considered and integrated, has been accelerated in primatology. Such comparative analyses between human and non-human primates are expected to provide us certain hints about the genetic contribution to human uniqueness. Indeed, comparison of human and non-human primate genomes has uncovered the human-specifi c genomic changes in several genes (Varki and Altheide 2005 ) . Moreover, the transcriptome analysis reveals differences in gene expression between humans and non-human primates (Caceres et al. 2003 ; Enard et al. 2002 ; Gilad et al. 2006 ; Khaitovich et al. 2004a Khaitovich et al. , b, 2005 Khaitovich et al. , 2006 Preuss et al. 2004 ; Somel et al. 2009 ; Varki and Altheide 2005 ) , as have proteomic and glycomic approaches.",

This complete lack of Neu5Gc was caused by a mutation in the CMAH gene (Chou et al. 1998 ; Irie et al. 1998 ) and was a starting point of the voyage to discover human-specifi c changes in the loci involved in sialic acid biology.

SIGLEC loci encode sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectins (Siglecs), a family of sialic acid recognition proteins ( Fig. 8.2 ). Siglecs are type I transmembrane proteins and mostly expressed in the cells involved in the innate and adaptive immune systems (Crocker 2005 ; Crocker et al. 2007 ; Crocker and Varki 2001 ; Varki and Angata 2006 ) .

The CD33/Siglec-3-related subgroup has experienced changes in gene number in each lineage of eutherian mammals (e.g., 12 genes in the chimpanzee and 5 genes in the mouse) (Angata et al. 2004 ; Cao et al. 2009 ; Crocker et al. 2007 ; Varki and Angata 2006 ) . The ST6GAL1 gene encodes one of the sialyltransferases that transfer sialic acid residues from CMP donor to glycoconjugates in the Golgi and is essential for the production of the a 2-6 linkages of sialic acids to N -glycan chains (Martin et al. 2002 ; Weinstein et al. 1987 ) . Interestingly, all loci that show certain human-specifi c changes are involved in diversifi cation of sialic acid-containing glycan chains (i.e., sialome) or in sialic acid recognition (see Fig. 8 .2 ). This fi nding suggests that sialic acid-mediated interactions (e.g., cell-cell communication) have been changed uniquely in the human lineage. Siglecs showing an \"essential\" arginine mutation are indicated by roman numerals (Modifi ed from Angata et al. 2004 ) ",

Interestingly, the expression of CMAH is specifi cally suppressed in mammalian brain, which results in the near absence of Neu5Gc in the non-human brain even though Neu5Gc is abundant in other tissues (Gottschalk 1960 ; Mikami et al. 1998 ; Muchmore et al. 1998 ; Nakao et al. 1991 ; Rosenberg and Schengrund 1976 ; Schauer 1982 ; Tettamanti et al. 1965 ) .

This calculated timing is compatible with the fact that the CMAH inactivation is universal to modern humans that appeared about 0.2 million years ago (White et al. 2003 ) . Interestingly, the transition from genus Australopithecus to genus Homo occurred about 2-3 million years ago (Carroll 2003 ; McHenry 1994 ; Wood 2002 ; Wood and Collard 1999 ) .

However, the time back to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA; 2.9 million years) of all human CMAH haplotypes is very close to the CMAH inactivation time (3.2 million years) with a short duration time, which indicates that inactivated CMAH allele may have fi xed quickly in our ancestral population after its emergence ) .

A human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , uses the sialic acid recognition molecule EBA-175 to bind host sialic acids in their invasion of red blood cells (Baum et al. 2003 ; Camus and Hadley 1985 ; Tomita et al. 1978 ) . Interestingly, the sialic acid preference of EBA-175 is different between Plasmodium falciparum and its most closely related chimpanzee parasite, Plasmodium reichenowi : that is, EBA-175 of Plasmodium falciparum prefers Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc, but that of Plasmodium reichenowi prefers Neu5Gc (Martin et al. 2005 ) . This Neu5Ac preference of Plasmodium falciparum may be regarded as an adaptation to the human-specifi c loss of Neu5Gc. Indeed, recent studies have shown that all extant strains of Plasmodium falciparum are likely derived from a single strain of Plasmodium reichenowi (Rich et al. 2009 ) . In this scenario, human ancestors may have escaped from the common ape malaria by eliminating Neu5Gc, but then later became susceptible to a variant that evolved to now recognize the Neu5Ac-rich red blood cells of humans (Varki and Gagneux 2009 ) .",

            "text": "SIGLEC1 belongs to the Siglec gene family and encodes Siglec-1 (sialoadhesin). It is composed of one V-set domain, sixteen C2-set domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail without any signaling motifs (Crocker 2005 ; Crocker et al. 2007 ; Crocker and Varki 2001 ; Hartnell et al. 2001 ) (Fig. 8.3 ). As compared with other Siglecs that have at most six C2-set domains, Siglec-1 displays a very long extracellular component (Fig. 8.3 ). In addition to Siglec-1, there are three known Siglecs having no signaling motif in their cytoplasmic tails: Siglec-14, Siglec-15, and Siglec-16 (Angata et al. , 2007 Cao et al. 2008 ) (Fig. 8.3 ). Even though these three Siglecs lack signaling motifs in their cytoplasmic tails, they can function as receptors in signal transduction by the association with an adaptor molecule (Angata et al. , 2007 Cao et al. 2008 ) (see the \" SIGLEC5 / SIGLEC14 \" and \" SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC16 \" sections for details; see Fig. 8 .3 ). In contrast to these Siglecs, Siglec-1 has no such intracellular partner molecules and seems to predominantly act as a simple adhesion molecule without signaling properties. These structural features make Siglec-1 unique among Siglecs.",

Similar to mouse Siglec-1, human Siglec-1 strongly prefers binding Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2000 ) . However, considering that the loss of Neu5Gc results in the enrichment of Neu5Ac in humans, human Siglec-1 has been exposed to an increase of endogenous ligand density. Siglec-1 is expressed in macrophages (Hartnell et al. 2001 ) , but the expression pattern of human Siglec-1 appears unique. In rats and chimpanzees, Siglec-1 on macrophages is found in both the perifollicular zone and marginal zone of the spleen (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2000 ) . In contrast, human Siglec-1 is found only in perifollicular zone (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2000 ) . Furthermore, almost all CD68+ macrophages in the human spleen are Siglec-1 positive, but only a subpopulation of macrophages expresses Siglec-1 in the chimpanzee spleen (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2000 ) . These humanspecifi c changes may have certain implications in Siglec-1 biology.",

Siglec-14 is a smaller molecule that consists of one V-set domain, two C2-set domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail with no signaling motif (Fig. 8.3 ) . However, Siglec-14 has a positively charged residue (arginine) in its transmembrane domain and associates with activating adaptor molecule DAP12 ( TYROBP ) via its charged residue (Fig. 8.3 ). Unlike Siglec-5, Siglec-14 therefore functions as an activating receptor. In addition to extreme sequence similarity, sialic acid recognition properties and tissue distribution are very similar between human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 Yamanaka et al. 2009 ) . Taken together, Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 are regarded as \"paired receptors\" . The role of paired receptors is elusive, but it is proposed that they are involved in fi ne-tuning of immune responses via a balance in the ligand binding by activating and inhibitory pair. Because the A/A \u00a2 region contains the upstream region and an exon that codes a sialic acid-binding domain (i.e., V-set domain), the gene conversion is the most likely a genomic mechanism that ensures that Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 are the paired receptors.",

A short (TG)n tract is located between the A/A \u00a2 and B/B \u00a2 regions and is an interesting sequence feature in the terms of the high frequency of the S5-S14 gene conversion. Regardless, the high frequency of S5-S14 gene conversion indicates the necessity of gene conversion in the Siglec-5/Siglec-14 pair as paired receptors. More importantly, the species-specifi c gene conversion suggests that sialic acid recognition properties and tissue distributions of Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 are similar but become unique in each primate species. In addition, the \"essential\" arginine residue that confers optimal sialic acid recognition to the sialic acid-binding domain is mutated in the great ape Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 (see Fig. 8.4 ) , which results in the reduction of sialic acid binding in the great ape Siglecs . It is therefore likely that the biological function of Siglec-5/Siglec-14 pair in the human differs from those in the great apes.",

As mentioned earlier, the approximately 1.3-kb A/A \u00a2 region of human SIGLEC14 represents extreme identity with the corresponding region of human SIGLEC5 . The gene fusion caused the lack of region unique to SIGLEC14 (i.e., the fusion boundary is in A/A \u00a2 region), resulting in the lack of Siglec-14 expression (Yamanaka et al. 2009 ) but continued expression of Siglec-5-like protein. The Siglec-14 null individuals are apparently healthy, which shows that the loss of Siglec-14 is not deleterious in healthy human populations (Yamanaka et al. 2009 ) . However, the frequency of the SIGLEC14 null allele is signifi cantly higher in Asians than in Africans and Europeans (Yamanaka et al. 2009 ) , suggesting unknown selective pressures. In this regard, it is interesting that group B Streptococcus , a common cause of sepsis and meningitis in human newborns, binds to Siglec-5 via cell wall-anchored b protein and thereby impairs leukocyte phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and extracellular trap production (Carlin et al. 2009a ) . This interaction increases bacterial resistance to phagocytosis and killing by human leukocytes and is considered as one of the strategies of microbial innate immune evasion (Carlin et al. 2009a ) . Siglec-14 may be involved in this interaction as a partner molecule of Siglec-5, and its functional deletion may have certain implication on pathogenic infection.",

Potential ligands (sialic acid-containing glycoproteins) of Siglec-6 are also expressed in placenta, which indicates that Siglec-6 was recruited to placental expression in the human lineage (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2007 ) . Human pregnancy and parturition are unique as compared with that of other mammals, including nonhuman primates. Human parturition is prolonged as a result of the negotiation between the larger fetal head and small birth canal in the compensation for the gain of the large brain and erect bipedalism (Lovejoy 2005 ) . Human labor tends to be long in duration, whereas chimpanzees give birth more rapidly (Keeling and Roberts 1972 ) . Siglec-6 expression increases with the onset and progression of labor (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2007 ) . By its role as an inhibitory receptor, Siglec-6, whose expression is recruited in the human placenta, might potentially contribute to the prolongation of the birth process in humans. Siglec-6 also binds to leptin, and they colocalize in the placenta (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al. 2007 ) . The plasma leptin concentration increases during labor (Nuamah et al. 2004 ) , and leptin-defi ciency mice represent increase of parturition time (Mounzih et al. 1998 ) . Even though leptin is not a dominant ligand, the leptin-Siglec-6 binding might be important in the prolongation of parturition. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that Siglec-6 expression is further upregulated in the placenta of patients with preeclampsia, a uniquely human disease (Winn et al. 2009 ) .",

The orthologue of Siglec-7 is not found in rodents, but that of Siglec-9 is probably rodent Siglec-E because of their similar gene location and expression pattern (Angata et al. 2004 ; Varki and Angata 2006 ) (see Fig. 8 .4 ). Siglec-9 is therefore considered as an ancient Siglec. Because of the close phylogenetic relationship and identical genomic/domain structure (Angata et al. 2004 ; Yousef et al. 2002 ) , Siglec-7 might have emerged from Siglec-9 via a gene duplication event in the Siglec expansion in primates. Siglec-7 is dominantly expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and weakly on monocytes (Crocker et al. 2007 ; Nicoll et al. 1999 ) . On the other hand, the expression level of Siglec-9 is high on monocytes, neutrophils, and conventional dendritic cells, but low on NK cells (Crocker et al. 2007 ; Zhang et al. 2000 ) . Indeed, although expression intensity is different between Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, both Siglecs are found on the same set of immune cells, which suggests that Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 genes retained the similar set of regulatory elements via gene duplication. Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 can both function as inhibitory receptors in these sets of immune cells because of the presence of ITIM in their cytoplasmic tails (Carlin et al. 2009b ; Crocker 2005 ; Crocker et al. 2007 ; Crocker and Varki 2001 ; Nicoll et al. 1999 ; Varki and Angata 2006 ; Zhang et al. 2000 ) .",

This preference indicates that Siglec-9 has changed its sialic acid preference to bind Neu5Ac in the human lineage after the loss of Neu5Gc. Interestingly, the greatest differences of sequence are found in the V-set domains (i.e., sialic acid-binding domains) of human and great ape Siglec-9 (Sonnenburg et al. 2004 ) . Moreover, the nonsynonymous substitution rate is higher than synonymous substitution rate in the exon encoding the V-set domain in the human lineage (Sonnenburg et al. 2004 ) . These fi ndings indicate that accelerated evolution has occurred in the V-set domain of human Siglec-9. As mentioned in the foregoing \" CMAH \" section, the loss of Neu5Gc occurred in the human lineage Varki 2001 ) . The acquisition of Neu5Ac binding in human Siglec-9 is therefore thought to be a consequence of adaptive evolution to the human-specifi c loss of Neu5Gc. Additionally, Siglec-7 shows similar differences in sequence and sialic acid binding between humans and chimpanzees, as does Siglec-9: multiple amino acid changes in the sialic acid-binding domain, chimpanzee Siglec-7 binding to Neu5Gc, and a human Siglec-7 accommodation of Neu5Ac (Sonnenburg et al. 2004 ) . Similar to Siglec-9, human Siglec-7 may have evolved under an adaptation to the loss of Neu5Gc.",

They are found in a head-to-head orientation about 9 kb apart Cao et al. 2008 ) (Fig. 8.4 ) . The SIGLEC11 gene is also found in non-human primates such as the great apes and rhesus monkey, and SIGLEC16 is clearly identifi ed at least from the chimpanzee (Angata et al. 2004 ; Cao et al. 2008 ; Hayakawa et al. 2005 ; Varki and Angata 2006 ) (see Fig. 8.4 ) . On the other hand, mouse, dog, and cow have a single Siglec gene or a Siglec-like pseudogene in the orthologous region of their genomes (Cao et al. 2008 ) . The approximately 3-kb genomic part containing the fi rst eight exons of SIGLEC11 represents sequence similarity to SIGLEC16 , which indicates an evolutionary kinship between SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC16 Hayakawa et al. 2005 ) . Thus, it has been proposed that SIGLEC11 and SIGLEC16 genes emerged via a gene duplication event in the primate lineage Cao et al. 2008 ) .",

Considering that Siglec-11 binds to sialic acids enriched in the brain, SIGLEC11 seems to have been recruited to brain expression in the human lineage.

Human SIGLEC16 is also expressed in the brain (Cao et al. 2008 ) . It appears that human Siglec-16 functions as an activating receptor by the association with an activating adaptor molecule, DAP12, via a positively charged lysine residue in the transmembrane domain (Cao et al. 2008 ) (Fig. 8.3 ) . As Siglec-11 is an inhibitory receptor because of the presence of ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail Crocker 2005 ; Crocker et al. 2007 ; Varki and Angata 2006 ) , the S16 \u2192 S11 gene conversion may have assured that Siglec-11 became an inhibitory partner of Siglec-16. In other words, human Siglec-11 and Siglec-16 became human-specifi c paired receptors via the S16 \u2192 S11 gene conversion. The emergence of paired receptors may possibly have contributed to the human brain evolution via alteration of microglial function such as the interaction with neural cells.",

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the continuous increase in the numbers and size of b -amyloid plaques (Salminen and Kaarniranta 2009 ) . In this hypothesis, Siglec-11 induces an antiinfl ammatory response in microglial cells by recognizing sialylated glycolipids or glycoproteins that bind to b -amyloid plaques, which allow plaques to evade the immune surveillance of microglia (Salminen and Kaarniranta 2009 ) . This is interesting, because microglial expression of Siglec-11 is found only in humans Hayakawa et al. 2005 ) , and Alzheimer's disease is common only in humans (Olson and Varki 2003 ; Varki and Altheide 2005 ) .",

However, the \"essential\" arginine residue, which confers the optimal sialic acid recognition, is conserved only in the fi rst V-set domain, indicating that only the fi rst V-set domain functions as a sialic acid-binding domain (Angata et al. 2001 ) . This unique second V-set domain does not defi ne Siglec-12 as an evolutionary lone Siglec because the genomic structure of SIGLEC12 is very similar to that of SIGLEC7 (Angata et al. 2001 ; Yousef et al. 2002 ) . As the Siglec-7 gene has an exon fossil that corresponds to an exon encoding the second V-set domain of Siglec-12 (Angata et al. 2001 ) , it is suggested that Siglec-12 and Siglec-7 are sibling molecules generated via a gene duplication event; this is also supported by the phylogenetic tree analysis (Angata et al. 2001 (Angata et al. , 2004 . On the other hand, despite the close evolutionary kinship with Siglec-7 expressed on immune cells (NK cells and monocytes), Siglec-12 displays a very different expression pattern, that is, expression on the luminal edge of epithelial cells in organs such as the stomach and tonsils (Angata et al. 2001 ) . It seems that the set of regulatory elements was not conserved in the gene duplication generating Siglec-12 and Siglec-7.",

Biosynthesis genes encode several enzymes involved in the production of sialic acid residues from precursor molecules. Activation, transport, and transfer genes encode many enzymes that activate free sialic acid into the nucleotide donor CMP-sialic acid and transport it into the Golgi in which sialic acid residues are transferred to newly synthesized glycoconjugates from the CMP donors. ST6Gal-I falls into this category. The modifi cation category consists of one known member to date, CMAH . Recognition refers to the loci involved in sialic acid recognition, and the major group of this category is the Siglecs. Recycling and degradation genes encode several molecules that function in the release of sialic acid residues from the glycan chain, the breakdown of sialic acid into acylmannosamines and pyruvate, the removal of 9-O -acetyl esters from sialic acid residues, the lysosomal transport of free sialic acid residues to the cytosol, and the stabilization of the sialidase that releases sialic acid residues. Evolutionary analysis of these represents an overall acceleration across all categories in primates compared with rodents (Altheide et al. 2006 ) , which suggests that the biological functions based on sialic acid biology have evolved more rapidly in the primate lineage.",

            "text": "Further comparison among categories shows that the recognition category has evolved more rapidly than the others (Altheide et al. 2006 ) . Notably, Siglecs display a higher rate of evolution than other members in the recognition category (Altheide et al. 2006 ) . Indeed, many human-specifi c changes occurred in Siglecs, especially, in CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs. This fi nding is consistent with human-chimpanzee genomic comparison, which reveals that CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs are one of the fastest evolving groups of genes in the entire genome (The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium 2005 ) . In addition to the human, non-human primates also display some changes in CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs (Fig. 8.5 ) . The SIGLEC7 and SIGLEC12 loci are completely deleted in the baboon (Angata et al. 2004 ) . Moreover, the \"essential\" arginine residue of Siglec-6 changed to leucine in the baboon, suggesting the loss of optimal sialic acid binding in baboon Siglec-6 ( Angata et al. 2004 ) . In addition to baboon Siglec-6, the great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan) show the \"essential\" arginine changed to histidine or tyrosine in both Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 . Interestingly, these Siglecs also show human-specifi c changes and might be most changeable in the primate Siglecs. The CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglec subgroup has been uniquely changed in each primate lineage (see Fig. 8 .5 ). Even within the components of Siglec molecules, the sialic acid-binding domain is the most rapidly evolving (Altheide et al. 2006 ) . It has been proposed that this high rate of evolution of the sialic acid-binding domains is a secondary \"Red Queen\" effect . Namely, the rapid evolution of sialome is caused by the arms race with sialic acid-binding pathogens (primary \"Red Queen\" effect), and this rapid sialome evolution then forces the sialic acid-binding domains to evolve quickly to keep up with recognizing the changing sialome as \"self\" (secondary \"Red Queen\" effect). Even though sialyltransferase sequences are highly conserved in primates, specifi c gains and losses of sialic acid expression, for example, human unique changes of the distribution of a 2-3-and a 2-6-linked sialic acids, are found in each primate species (Altheide et al. 2006 ; Gagneux et al. 2003 ) . Thus, sialic acid-binding domains may have evolved uniquely in each primate species.",

The timing estimation of genomic event (e.g., gene conversion) involved in the change of sialic acid-binding ability would be helpful to test this hypothesis. At this time, it is supposed that the changes of sialic acid-binding ability in human Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 occurred about 3 million years ago , which is consistent with the hypothesis. Timing estimations for other Siglecs are currently under way. In addition, the emergence of many human-specifi c pathogens that express Neu5Ac might have also occurred because of the change in inhibitory human Siglecs toward binding Neu5Ac rather than Neu5Gc (Carlin et al. 2009b ) .",
