This has made them an all important agent for CoV evolution and transmission. Our objective in this study was to investigate the dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of betacoronaviruses (\u03b2-CoV) among African bats. Three data sets were generated from sequences of the partial RNA depedent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of Bat coronaviruses from seven African, three Asian, and four European countries. Phylogenetic trees was infered using MEGA Vs 7, Phylogeography and Evolutionary analysis were carried out, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in BEAST, and visualised with SPREAD3. Results showed that majority of the African strains fell within lineage D. Evololutionary rate of the African Bt-\u03b2-CoV was 1.301 \u00d7 10 -3 , HPD (1.064 \u00d7 10 -3 -1.434 \u00d7 10 -3 ), the MCC tree of the African strains showed two clades, lineage D, and lineage C. The TMRCA for lineage D strains was 1972, 95% HPD (1951-1990), and 2010, 95% HPD (2006 -2014 for the South African strains. There were inter-continental dispersal of Bt-CoV from China and Hong Kong into Central and Southern Africa. In conclusion we advocate for broader studies of whole genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.",

The submilycoronavirinae contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Masters and Pearlman, 2013) . They generally infect animals such as mammals and birds, they are the causative agents of many pathogenic diseases such as transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (TGEV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBD), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Saif, 2004) . Coronaviruses have been reported as early as 1930 (Masters and Pearlman, 2013) but the earliest report of human coronaviruses was in the year 1960, where two strains namely HuCoV 229-E and HuCoV OC43 were described (Hamre and Procknow, 1966; McIntoch et al, 1967) . Generally betacoranviruses have been observed to cause very severe disease in man and are largely known to be zoonotic. It was not until after the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong and parts of China in 2003, that studies into the zoonotic origin of the incriminated pathogen SARS CoV revealed that the Chinese rinolophid bats maintained a genetically related strain of the SARS CoV, (Lau et al, 2005; Li et al, 2005) . This finding sparked up interest in bat CoV research. Another coronavirus termed middle east severe respiratory syndrome virus (MERS CoV) was reported in the Arabian peninsular in 2012 (Zaki et al, 2012) . Genetically similar strain to the MERS CoV were also isolated from Pipistellus, Tyloncteris and Neoromica bats (Anan et al, 2010) .",

            "text": "We analyzed betacoronavirus sequences from seven African countries distributed among eight bat species as shown in Table 1 . The most abundant bat species sampled in this study was M. pussilus, and Cameroon had the highest distribution of bat species sampled in this study. This result does not necessarily represent the true picture of bat species diversity in Africa, as some countries lack sequence information for bats due lack of surveillance. Few studies have been carried in Africa on coronaviruses among bats leaving a huge gap in epidemiologic information regarding beta BtCoV(\u03b2-BtCoV ) in Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of \u03b2-BtCoV sequences revealed that majority of the African strains fell within lineage D consisting of strains from Cameroon, DRC, Kenya, Madagascar and Nigeria. This observation is in agreement with a previous report which identified the existence of a single BtCoV clade circulating around Africa (Leopardi et al, 2016) . However, it was identified that isolates consisting largely of strains isolated among Neomorican South African bats clustering within lineage C together with strains from Italy and Spain (Figure 1 ). The species-specific phylogenetic clustering observed among the Neomorican bats suggests limited cross-species \u03b2-CoV transmission among these species of bats in Africa, although larger epidemiological studies among these species of bats will shed more light as to the cause of this observed trend in Africa. Studies have shown that \u03b2 coronaviruses of lineage C such as MERS CoV are capable of both intra-species transmission and inter host transmission (Min et al, 2016) . In this study there seems to be inter-species transmission among the lineage D betacoronaviruses, allowing for potential recombination and rapid evolution of this lineage, as previously reported (Tao et al, 2017) . This type of observation was also reported in earlier study of an inter-species transmission events of alpha CoV HKU10 in bat species of different orders (Lau et al, 2012) . Resultsfor eoot to tip divergence showed the data set had a positive temporal signal (Figure 2 ) with the correlation coefficient = 0.0286 and R 2 = 0.0818. The MCC tree of the African strains shows clearly the two major clades the lineage D, and the South African linieage C (Figure 3 ).The TMRCA for lineage D strains dating back to 1972, 95% HPD , and the TMRCA for lineage C strains 2010 95% HPD (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) . This shows that lineage C is relatively recent and probably evolved from the existing lineage D strains. Evololutionary rate of the African bat \u03b2-CoV was set at 1.301 \u00d7 10 -3 , HPD (1.064 \u00d7 10 -3 -1.434 \u00d7 10 -3 ), this is slightly higher that the evolutionary rate for the ongoing SARS CoV-2 which has been estimated to have an evolutionary rate of 8.0 \u00d7 10-4 (www.nextstrain.org/ncov/global ). This is also slightly higher than the evolutionary rate reported for the partial RdRP gene of HuCoV OC43 of 1.06 \u00d7 10 -4 (Vijen et al, 2006) . A similar topology was also observed for the MCC tree of the second data set which included \u03b2-BtCoV from Asia and Europe, with a MRCA of 1892 (HPD 1850 (HPD -1926 for all the strains, with the African strains showing the consistent TMRCA as described above (Figure 4) . The African lineage D strains seemed to emerge from their parental strain at around the year 1960 (HPD, 1944 (HPD, -1976 this observation supports the hypothesis that lineage D viruses could have been circulating in Africa long before they were first isolated. Whereas for the South African lineage C strains they seemed to emerge from their parental lineage around the year 1983 (Figure 4) , indicating a more recent introduction into Africa, however studies have dated their origin based on partial RdrP gene to as back as 1859 (Lau et al, 2013) . Phylogeographic dispersal of the Bat \u03b2-CoV revealed numerous inter-continental spread events from China and Honk Kong into Cental Africa (DRC and Kenya), Cameroun in West Africa, and South Africa Figure 5 . There were also dispersal of these viruses between France and some African countries such as Cameroun, South Africa and the DRC. There was also dispersal from Spain into Kenya, South Africa and Madagascar. The only dispersal event from Italy into Africa was into Nigeria. The dispersal observed between the Bt CoV isolated in Africa and the ones in Asia and Europe show evidence of long distance transmission event although a significant limitation to this was our inability to demonstrate bat migration patterns between these countries. Studies have shown the potential for African fruit bats to migrate long distances covering thousands of Kilometers, for instance a study using satellite telemertry in Zambia showed that Elodiun hevium is capable of covering thousands of kilometers during migration (Richter and Cummings, 2008) . Another study showed that African bats were capable of migration exceeding 2000km (Ossa et al, 2012) . Intra-continental dispersal events were observed between Cameroun, DRC and South Africa, as well as direct dispersal from Cameroon into Madagascar. The AfrBtCoV strains displayed steady state population demography as depicted by their Bayesian Skyline plot ( Figure 6 ). The population demography reported in this study might not represent the true picture of the virus population, as the dataset utilized in this study is limited by its size and might not represent the true demographic population of BtCoV in Africa.",

We have shown the circulation of two distinct lineages B and C among African bat species and the possibility of inter-species transmission. A major limitation was our inability to analyze spike protein sequence data of these viruses as this would have shed more light on their evolution in relation to infectivity and transmission. We have however shown the importance of molecular surveillance of viruses with zoonotic potential such as coronaviruses. We advocate for broader trans-continental studies involving full genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population. ",

The relationship between root-to-tip divergence and sampling dates supported the use of molecular clock analysis in this study. Phylogenetic trees were generated by Bayasian inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4(Suchard et al, 2018 ). We partitioned the coding genes into first+second and third codon positions and applied a separate Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY+G) substitution model with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity among sites to each partition(Hasegawa et al,  1985). Two clock models were initially evaluated strict and relaxed molecular clock, with four differenttree priors, constant population size, exponential population size, Bayesian Skyride plot and Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot. Each selected model was run for an initial 30, 000, 000 states. Models were compared using Bayes factor with marginal likelihood estimated using the path sampling and stepping stone methods implemented in BEAST version 1.10.4  (Scuchard et al, 2018). The relaxed clock with Gausian Markov Random Field Skyride plot (GMRF) coalescent prior was selected for the final analysis. The MCMC chain was set at 100, 000, 000 states with10% as burn in. Results were visualized using Tracer version 1.8. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), all effective sampling size ESS values were >200 indicating sufficient sampling. Bayesian skyride analysis was carried out to visualize the epidemic evolutionary history using Tracer v 1.8. (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).To reconstruct the ancestral-state phylogeographic transmission across countries and hosts, we used the discrete-trait model implemented in BEAST version 1.",
