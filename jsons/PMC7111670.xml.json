Although the primary target of IBV is the epithelial surface of the respiratory tract, the virus also replicates in other organs, including the kidney, gastro-intestinal, urinary and reproductive tracts depending on the viral strain (Cook et al., 2012). The most common symptoms of IB are related to the respiratory tract, including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge (Jackwood and de Wit, 2013).",

The S protein is the major viral attachment protein and is essential for both binding to the receptor on the target cell, and for subsequent virus-cell fusion that results in release of the viral genome into the cell. It is the largest structural protein of coronaviruses, forming club-shaped projections on the surface of the virus membrane (Masters and Perlman, 2013), and is heavily N-glycosylated with approximately 30 potential glycosylation sites (Binns et al., 1985). It is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits of approximately 500 and 600 amino acids, respectively (Cavanagh et al., 1986). The role of the spike in determining the virus\u2019 tropism and pathogenesis has recently been summarized (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014).",

MBL is synthesized in the liver, is mainly present in blood serum and it plays an important role in the first line of host defense by binding to carbohydrates on the surface of a wide range of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of MBL, which depends on the presence of calcium ions that facilitate interaction with the hydroxyl groups of the glycan ligand in the binding pocket of the CRDs of MBL (Veldhuizen et al., 2011). Binding of pathogens leads to direct neutralization of the microorganism or activation of the complement system through MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) (Dommett et al., 2006, Ip et al., 2009). MBL deficiency increases the susceptibility to various infectious diseases and autoimmune, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders (Eisen, 2010, Turner and Hamvas, 2000), underlining the multifunctional role of the protein.",

            "text": "The results described in this study show the antiviral ability of chicken MBL against IBV and give insights into its mechanism of action. rcMBL acts by direct binding the viral glycoprotein spike through its CRD, thereby aggregating virus particles. For mammalian MBL, direct virus neutralization through interaction with viral glycoproteins, thereby blocking virus binding to receptors on host cells, has been described before (Brown et al., 2010, Ip et al., 2005, Ji et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2010). Here, we observed that rcMBL binds two IBV strains, IBV-Beaudette and IBV-M41, in line with a previous observation with an unspecified IBV strain (Kjaerup et al., 2014a). As spike proteins of all other IBV strains are, while diverse in sequence, heavily glycosylated (with approximately 30 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites), it is expected that rcMBLs antiviral activity extends beyond IBV geno- or serotypes. Other lectins have also been reported to act during the initial stages of the infection of coronaviruses. Interestingly, while the red algae lectin griffithsin interacts directly with the spike protein of MERS-CoV (Millet et al., 2016), the same lectin showed post-binding antiviral activity during entry of many different coronaviruses in cell culture cells (O'Keefe et al., 2010).",

            "text": "IBV primarily targets to the epithelium of upper respiratory tract of chickens, while cMBL, in analogy with mammals, is mainly produced in the liver, and secreted in blood (Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000). However, gene expression of MBL has been detected in the trachea and air sacs of healthy chicken with very low amounts in the lung itself (Hogenkamp et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2016a). In addition, no evidence is available yet that MBL protein is locally produced in the trachea of healthy chickens. Therefore, it is questionable whether MBL can exert its innate host defense activity towards IBV directly at the side of entry of the host. It might be that the production of cMBL is upregulated locally as a result of IBV infection, as has been observed for infectious laryngotracheitis virus and infectious bursal disease virus in chickens (Nielsen et al., 1998). Similar observations have been done in mice, where MBL was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of influenza A virus (IAV-H1N1) infected, but not in that of healthy mice (Reading et al., 1997). Indeed, after IBV infection an increase in cMBL gene expression was measured in the trachea of chicken (Kjaerup et al., 2014b), but whether this leads to an increased cMBL production and secretion needs to be confirmed. Interestingly, serum cMBL showed an acute response during IBV infection with an approximately two-fold increase in concentration (Juul-Madsen et al., 2011, Nielsen et al., 1998, Nielsen et al., 1999). As transport of IBV from the primary site of infection to other target organs has been suggested to occur via viremia (McFerran and McNulty, 1993, Reddy et al., 2016), it might well be that MBL is able to interact directly with IBV in the blood during transport to other target organs.",

MBL can act as an opsonin, where binding to virions can increase phagocytosis of MBL-coated viral particles, as has been shown for several viruses, including IAV (Hartshorn et al., 1993, Hartshorn et al., 1997), but not yet for IBV. In addition, MBL might enhance viral neutralization in vivo through the activation of complement via the lectin pathway, leading to enhanced influx of innate immune cells (reviewed in (Dunkelberger and Song, 2010)). The complement activation in chickens appeared to be correlated with the cMBL concentration in serum (Juul-Madsen et al., 2003) suggesting that opsonization via complement might play a role to reduce virus titers. Indeed, reduced viral loads were observed in trachea in chickens with high MBL serum concentrations compared to those having low MBL (Kjaerup et al., 2014b). However, as many other genes are differentially expressed between the high and low MBL producing chicken breeds (Hamzic et al., 2016) the contribution of other factors cannot be ruled out.",
