As of 24 March 2020, the virus has caused viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, China, and ten of thousands of cases in 184 other countries and territories. This study explores the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this COVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given the interest in the topic. Methods: Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT) using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are worldwideResults: The results show that the highest worldwide peak in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy, with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day. Conclusion: This short communication gives a brief introduction to how the demand for information on coronavirus epidemic is reported through GT.",

The methodology for this communication follows the principles presented by [9] that describe how to select the appropriate keyword(s), region(s), period, and category. Data is collected from GT and is normalized. High interest in a search query is expressed by 100, whereas a lack of interest or insufficient data is expressed by 0. GT contains data from different geographical locations that is segmented into countries, territories and cities; it also allows a custom time range to be set.",

Since 1 February, global interest has decreased even though the number of new cases reported daily is increasing. In the first wave, the highest number of confirmed new cases was on 5 February. In the second wave, so far the highest number of confirmed new cases in a single day was on 24 March. Figure 1 presents the global, Chinese, South Korean, Italian and Iranian results compared to the number of new COVID-19 cases. Since GT has a two-day data delay, GT data at the time of writing ends on 21 March. The left axis shows normalized GT search volume. The right axis shows new COVID-19 cases [4] .

GT data reveals the rapid growth of the second wave of interest in coronavirus since 21 February 2020. This rising interest trend is observed worldwide and in the presented countries, where a rapid increase in cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 has been reported since 21 February 2020 [11] . Table 1 presents Pearson's correlation matrix of GT trends between Worldwide and in reported countries in the time of first wave, from 15 January to 18 February 2020.
