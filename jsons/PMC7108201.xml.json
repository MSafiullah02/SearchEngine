The implementation of DNA and protein microarrays has led to a tremendous acceleration in biomarker discovery. The ultimate goal is to identify sets of disease-specific biomarkers and then to combine them with a robust screening technology. This approach will allow clinicians to screen patients before prescribing a particular drug in order to exclude potential adverse effects or determine the most suitable dose. Besides making improvements to this new technology, researchers must also identify and validate appropriate sets of biomarkers and subsequently integrate them into healthcare services. Fig. 3 summarizes the work flow of biomarker discovery with protein microarrays and the anticipated application of protein microarray\u2013based assays for personalized medicine.",

            "text": "Protein microarrays have recently demonstrated their huge potential in the field of biomarker discovery. RPPMs have been used to identify biomarker candidates in cancer patients that show changes in concentration that correlate with the state and progression of disease (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20). Sandwich immunoassays have proved to be an excellent method for accurately quantifying biomarker candidates. Multiplexing can easily be achieved with bead-based technologies. High-throughput multiplexed immunoassays are perfectly suited for screening cancer biomarkers in a large cohort of clinical samples (21)(22) and provide insights into the details of the production of plasma or tissue proteins, thereby furnishing detailed information about a patient\u2019s physiological and pathologic condition. The use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools allows the identification of biomarker patterns that can then be used for diagnostic purposes. Data sets generated with multiplexed immunoassays can be integrated into multivariate diagnostic models with such algorithms as K-nearest neighbor and logistic regression. Such analyses can markedly improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnostics compared with what was previously possible with single-parameter analysis (23)(24)(25). Recently, Visintin et al. used a 6-plex multiplexed sandwich immunoassay [leptin, prolactin, osteopontin, insulin-like growth factor II, macrophage inhibitory factor, and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)] to screen plasma from patients with ovarian cancer. Use of this 6-plex panel to screen samples from 362 healthy controls and 156 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer screened achieved a 95.3% diagnostic sensitivity and a 99.4% diagnostic specificity (23). Amonkar et al. identified an 11-plex panel [CA-125, CA 19-9, soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), C-reactive protein, myoglobin, apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1), apo CIII, macrophage inhibitory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, and tenascin C] and used it to distinguish plasma samples from patients with ovarian cancer from samples from patients with benign conditions. The screening of 176 patients and 187 controls revealed that the 11-plex achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as high as 90% (24)(25). In contrast, a single parameter, CA-125, currently achieves a diagnostic sensitivity of <60% in early stages of the disease (23). These candidate biomarker panels require further validation with larger patient cohorts, however, before they can reliably be used in routine clinical diagnostics. The increasing list of biomarker candidates shows that protein microarrays have a huge potential to contribute to the development of individualized medical therapies. The knowledge generated with such protein microarrays not only will help clinicians adapt therapies to individual patient requirements but also will help minimize the risk of adverse effects caused by an incorrectly chosen drug or drug dose.",

Combining the current antibody arrays with a direct sample-labeling strategy allows the analysis of only a limited number of parameters. Despite all the efforts made in recombinant antibody technology and classic antibody generation, high-quality antibodies directed against every single protein of interest are still not available (27)(28).",

High-density protein microarrays are a data-driven approach that enables the identification of new autoantibodies that are specific for a variety of diseases (7)(33). Hudson et al. used a protein microarray containing 5005 human proteins to identify autoantibody sets capable of recognizing 94 antigens in the sera of patients with ovarian cancer (30). Four of these antigens were further confirmed with immunoblot and tissue microarray analyses. The researchers found that lamin A/C, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1), and Ral-binding protein 1 were produced in larger quantities in cancer tissue than in control tissues. Furthermore, the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the combined use of lamin A/C and SSRP1 performed better than tumor marker CA-125 alone in identifying ovarian cancer.",

Zhu et al. generated a coronavirus protein microarray containing 82 purified proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 5 additional coronaviruses, with the aim of monitoring the immune response of patients infected with SARS. Approximately 400 serum samples from the Canadian SARS outbreak were screened. These samples included those from confirmed SARS coronavirus cases, patients with respiratory illnesses, and asymptomatic healthcare workers. Bioinformatics data analysis allowed classification of the sera with 91% accuracy (90% diagnostic sensitivity and 93% diagnostic specificity) (34). This study demonstrated very well that protein microarrays can be used for large-scale identification of virus-specific antibodies in sera. Schmid et al. generated a protein microarray consisting of 251 proteins (92% of the vaccinia virus proteome). The screening of the sera obtained from vaccinated individuals (n = 20) and nonvaccinated individuals (n = 20) revealed that the primary antibody response to individual vaccinia proteins varied from individual to individual, whereas the total number of proteins recognized by antibodies was only slightly altered after the second vaccination (35). These data sets proved that protein microarrays could measure humoral immune responses to vaccines and provide a straightforward approach to evaluating newly developed vaccines.",

Fine-needle biopsy is the standard diagnostic method, but 30% of results generated with the biopsy approach are not satisfactory.

Univariate analysis revealed that 5 factors [epithelial growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IL-5, IL-8, and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normally T-expressed and presumably secreted)] enabled individuals with thyroid disease to be distinguished from the control group. Further multivariate analysis revealed a panel of 4 parameters (IL-8, HGF, monocyte-induced \u03b3 interferon, IL-12p40) that can discriminate between benign and malignant disease states (area under the ROC curve, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65\u20130.90).

Kim et al. used a similar approach to distinguish breast cancer patients from healthy volunteers (46). Thirty-five analytes were selected from 4500 previously screened plasma samples obtained from patients with various types of cancer. Three biomarkers (EGF, soluble CD40 ligand, pro\u2013apo A1) were identified at increased concentrations in plasma samples from the breast cancer group. Six biomarkers that showed a decreased plasma concentration [high molecular weight kininogen, apo A1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, vitamin D\u2013binding protein, and vitronectin] were also identified. Different algorithms were then used to generate diagnostic models, which allowed breast cancer patients to be discriminated from the healthy controls with a high level of diagnostic accuracy (91.8% with random forest analysis, 91.5% with support vector machine analysis, and 87.6% with linear discriminant analysis).",

Bozza et al. used miniaturized sandwich immunoassays to evaluate the predictive values of cytokine production patterns in a sepsis time course (47). They found that some cytokine concentrations increased as the severity of inflammation and organ dysfunction increased. With regard to the severity of organ dysfunction, the concentrations of 2 the 17 evaluated cytokines, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), measured on day 1 correlated significantly with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Increased plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor within the first 24 h correlated with organ dysfunction, which failed to recover on day 3. The concentrations of 6 cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) allowed prediction of early mortality.",

Eleven proteins (IL-11, IP-10, haptoglobin, matrix metalloproteinase 9, MIP-1\u03b3, fibrinogen, IgA, MIP-3\u03b2, VCAM-1, apo A1, and IL-18) displayed higher concentrations in a late stage of the disease. The concentrations of all these biomarkers except apo A1 correlated with the histopathologic scores. Appropriate antibiotic treatment improved the clinical signs of IBD and led to decreases in the mean plasma concentrations of many of the biomarkers. Such IBD animal models seem to be suitable for identifying noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring IBD progression, while at the same time increasing our understanding of IBD pathogenesis, which is a major prerequisite for the development of new therapies. The observations from animal models need to be confirmed with human IBD plasma samples, however, before definite statements can be made on the suitability of such biomarkers.",

Fabre et al. profiled plasma cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing etanercept therapy (49). The Evidence Biochip Array (Randox Laboratories) was used to measure 10 proinflammatory and 2 antiinflammatory cytokines in serum samples collected on days 0 and 90. The researchers found that high plasma concentrations of MCP-1 and EGF were associated with a response to etanercept.

Plasma parameters were quantitatively analyzed in samples from patients with a diagnosis of stage III/IV oropharyngeal carcinoma to discover whether the plasma parameters of these proteins correlated with treatment response, relapse, or survival (51). The patients were treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the relationship between cytokine plasma concentrations and the survival rate was investigated with Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The detailed analysis of the data revealed that the concentrations of these cytokines correlated with both the response to therapy and poorer cause-specific survival. A history of nonsmoking and higher vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations also correlated with an increased survival rate. This approach is envisioned to be extendable to other cancers with a poor predicted outcome, because the monitoring of longitudinal changes in cytokine concentrations can complement the information provided by clinical monitoring and imaging approaches.",

A systematic analysis of such signaling proteins in samples of individual tumors may reveal multiple causative players during cancer progression (14)(52)(53). Laser capture microdissection can be used to resolve the problem of tissue heterogeneity by enabling the isolation of pure tumor cells from tissue sections (14). Wulfkuhle et al. used RPPMs in combination with laser capture microdissection technology to carry out a systematic analysis of cellular signaling in breast cancer tissue and metastatic lesions (20). Twenty-five surgical samples of human breast cancers were screened for the presence of 90 signaling molecules. It was possible to define subgroups of samples of primary breast tumors and metastatic lesions by their protein production or degree of phosphorylation on the basis of the pathway-specific signaling profiles, such as EGFR family signaling, AKT/mTOR pathway activation, c-kit/abl growth factor signaling, or ERK pathway activation. The authors proposed that the detailed characterization of signaling activity has a huge potential with respect to the design of patient-tailored therapeutic regimens. With a similar approach, Sheehan et al. profiled the signaling activities of epithelial and stromal compartments of colon carcinomas. The authors inferred from the production patterns of >60 signaling molecules that a coordinated cross talk exists between epithelium and stroma in cancer, suggesting an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. Such cross talk could produce a therapy-resistant tumor epithelium. Such protein microarray\u2013generated findings could have therapeutic implications for the treatment of colon cancer (54).",

The large number of parameters, variables, and constraints in cellular networks requires the use of numerical and computational techniques. The efforts made in systems biology approaches are aimed at gaining detailed insights into all factors in a living cell and the changes that occur during disease progression (55). Protein microarrays have proved to be one of the large-scale measurement methods capable of delivering experimental data sets in the quantities required for computational approaches (56). Knickerbocker et al. analyzed early mortality in patients undergoing kidney dialysis. The researchers applied protein microarrays to quantify sets of plasma parameters in patient samples and combined these data sets with such clinical variables as body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, underlying disease, and method of vascular access (57). The authors were able to predict early mortality in patients undergoing kidney dialysis when the molecular markers were combined with the clinical variables.

The current high-output technologies used for the discovery of biomarkers are low-throughput methods (60)(61). Therefore, novel technologies with a higher throughput and a higher analytical sensitivity are required; such technologies must also take into account the fact that only small quantities of sample are typically available, particularly in the case of clinical samples (61). Protein microarrays have proved to be an excellent approach for biomarker-validation studies. Over the last few years, different automation concepts have been developed for protein arrays. One of the most advanced formats is the bead-based systems, for which different companies have developed automated systems (62). In addition, planar protein microarrays have been adapted to the 96-well microtiter plate format, which allows microarrays to be processed with standard pipetting robots or multichannel pipettes (22)(57)(63).

The FDA cleared these tests in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The Plexus HerpeSelect 1 and 2 IgG test kit is the first multiplex, type-specific herpes simplex virus serology test that uses Luminex xMAP technology. It detects antibodies to herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and assists clinicians in choosing appropriate treatment and counseling. The second test, the Plexus EBV Multi-Analyte Diagnostics serology test kit, is used for detecting the presence or absence of IgG and IgM antibodies in human blood serum. It is used for the diagnosis of Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection and Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u2013associated infectious mononucleosis. The Randox Evidence Biochip Array system can perform miniaturized multiplexed immunoassays in a macroarray format containing 25 features, with chemiluminescence used as readout. This fully automated clinical biochip analyzer screens patient samples for a variety of markers specific to fertility, cardiac disease, tumors, cytokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, thyroid function, or drug abuse. The company\u2019s drug abuse panel has received FDA clearance; the other assays are currently being evaluated by the FDA (68).",
