Both insecticides were diluted in acetone to prepare concentrations for testing in the residual contact bioassay, as suggested by Hamm et al. (2006). For each population, five to seven concentrations (0.016 to 16 \u03bcg a.i./cm2) of each insecticide were applied in glass Petri dishes (9 cm \u00d7 1 cm [diameter by height]) using a repetition pipette (1 ml per dish). Petri dishes were rotated manually so that an even layer of insecticide dried on the inner surface. Control dishes were prepared using 1 ml of acetone only. Petri dishes were then placed for 2 h in a fume hood to dry. After this, each dish was infested with 10\u201320 larvae (8\u201310 mm length) or 10\u201320 adults (30\u201340 d in adult stage) of the F1 or F2 generations in the laboratory. The bioassays were repeated twice for each population and development stage, with each concentration being repeated twice per bioassay (a total of four replicates per concentration). After infestation, all plates were placed in a climatic chamber at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, relative humidity 70 \u00b1 10%, and photophase of 12 h. Mortality was assessed after 48 h.

A likelihood ratio test was conducted to test the hypothesis that the LCp values (lethal concentration at which a percentage mortality P is attained) were equal. If the hypothesis was rejected, pairwise comparisons were performed and significance was declared if CIs did not overlap (Savin et al. 1977, Robertson et al. 2007). The significance of differences among slopes was determined by likelihood ratio test for parallelism and equality (Savin et al. 1977). Resistance ratios were calculated by dividing the LC50 of the populations from broiler farms by the corresponding parameter for the susceptible reference population (Lab). To estimate diagnostic concentrations for insect resistance monitoring programs, a joint analysis was performed. In this analysis, mortality data were fitted with a binomial model using the log-log complement connection function (gompit) (PROC PROBIT, SAS Institute 2000). In this analysis, LC99 values and respective CIs were estimated. Based on the LC99 values, candidate diagnostic concentrations were designated for the resistance monitoring of A. diaperinus to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in Brazil.",

A similar resistance ratio was also observed to cyfluthrin, of up to 10-fold, in adult beetles from the eastern United States (Hamm et al. 2006) and to beta-cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and deltamethrin, up to 16-fold, in Australia (Lambkin and Furlong 2011).

To organophosphates, a similar resistance ratio, from 1- to 14-fold, was reported in populations of A. diaperinus from Paran\u00e1 (Lapa, Arauc\u00e1ria, and Cascavel); to dichlorvos, an insecticide that act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, resistance ratios were similar to chlorpyrifos (Chernaki-Leffer et al. 2011).

In another study, a higher resistance ratio up to 79-fold, was also reported to fenitrothion in adult beetles in Australia (Lambkin 2005). The high resistance ratio to chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos in A. diaperinus populations from Paran\u00e1 reported here and in previous studies indicates a possible cross-resistance among these insecticides, as published in another Coleopteran species (Attia and Frecker 1984, Zettler and Cuperus 1990).",

However, from an Insect Resistance Management (IRM) perspective, variation in susceptibility is also an indication of the ability of the beetles to adapt to the insecticides, especially in populations with the highest LC50 values. In other words, the relative high resistance ratio to cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in some A. diaperinus populations from Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1 seems a probable response of high exposure to selection pressure. Based on this, IRM strategies should be adopted, by associating physical and chemical methods using insecticides with distinct modes of action against this species, to delay or prevent resistance evolution (Wolf et al. 2015).",

Cypermethrin is a sodium channel modulator that causes excitatory paralysis of the insect, whereas chlorpyrifos is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee [IRAC] 2017). Both active ingredients are widely used against A. diaperinus in broiler farms in Brazil and other countries (Steelman 2008, Tomberlin et al. 2008, Chernaki-Leffer et al. 2011, Oliveira et al. 2016). Specifically, in Brazil, the reduced number of active ingredients registered for use in broiler farms has contributed to the resistance evolution in A. diaperinus. Thus, insecticides from other chemical groups should be considered against this pest, such as spinosad and imidacloprid, which mimic the agonistic action of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Additionally, chlorfenapyr, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation through the disruption of the proton gradient and interferes with metabolic processes and energy production in mitochondria (IRAC 2017). Spinosad, imidacloprid, and chlorfenapyr are not registered for use in broiler farms in Brazil, but they showed high efficacy against A. diaperinus in Australia and the United States (Lambkin and Rice 2007, Singh and Johnson 2015). Spinosad also increased the mortality of resistant beetles to cyfluthrin and fenitrothion, due to the absence of cross-resistance among these insecticides (Lambkin and Furlong 2014). Therefore, the Brazilian pesticide regulatory agencies and companies should register these and other chemical insecticides for use in broiler farms, to improve the management of A. diaperinus.",

The use of these diagnostic concentrations in residual contact bioassays make this procedure fast, practical, and compatible with large scale bioassays in IRM programs. Future efforts should be concentrated on collecting representative samples of this species, especially in those regions with the highest amount of broiler farms. Then, expose the beetles to the diagnostic concentrations defined here, to identify resistant levels in Brazilian populations of this species.
