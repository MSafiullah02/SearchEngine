However none have shown sufficient efficacy, rather these vaccines have enhanced the onset of FIP (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Compared to antibody-negative kittens, intraperitoneal inoculation with FIPV induces more severe clinical signs in anti-FIPV antibody-positive kittens, and in kittens which have undergone passive immunization with serum or purified IgG from antibody-positive cats (8, 9) . This phenomenon is referred to as ADE of viral infection. The ADE of FIPV infection is a serious obstacle to its vaccine-based prevention. Cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of FIP (2) . Thus, it is essential that vaccines against FIPV infection induce a cellular immune response.",

The Cterminal S2 domain sequentially contains the PC region, putative FP, 4,3 hydrophobic HR1, IH domain, HR2, and the cluster aromatic amino acid domain from the Nterminal, and is responsible for driving viral and target cell membrane fusion (10, 12) . The N-terminal S1 domain contains receptor-binding, neutralizing antibodybinding, and ADE epitopes (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .

Firstly, we investigated the immunogenicity of three baculovirus-expressed proteins, PC, IH, and FP-HR2 proteins, derived from the S2 domain of the type I FIPV KU-2 strain (Fig. 1 ). It has been suggested that FP-HR2 protein has marked immunogenicity. Secondly, we searched for epitopes inducing a Th1-and/or Th2type immune response using 30 synthetic peptides derived from the FP-HR2 region. As a result, we identified 5 and 16 peptides including Th1 and Th2 epitopes, respectively. ",

FP-HR2 protein consists of FP, HR1, HR2, and IH domains. The concentrations of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4 in FP-HR2 protein-immunized mice were significantly higher than those of IH protein-immunized mice. This suggests that, except for the IH domain, the FP, HR1, and/or HR2 region contains a highly immunogenic site. IH protein showed less immunogenicity in mice, especially in regard to induction of IFN-\u03b3, than did FP-HR2 protein. However, stimulation with IH-2, a peptide derived from the IH region, induced IFN-\u03b3 production, suggesting the presence of Th1 epitopes. Reportedly, SARS-CoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus produce no neutralizing antibodies after immunization of mice with a peptide containing a neutralizing epitope, but enhance immunogenicity and produce neutralizing antibodies when bound to a peptide with Th1 epitopes (26, 27) . The HR1 and HR2 regions contain peptides with the Th1 epitopes identified in this study, (i.e. HR1-7, HR1-14, HR2-4, and HR2-11). Thus, IH protein alone is unlikely to recognize antigen-presenting cells; however, FP-HR2 protein (i.e. IH protein bound to HR1 and HR2) may exhibit greater immunogenicity.",

The results demonstrated the presence of epitopes showing a marked capacity to bind to aa1109-1117 (HR1-8) of the HR1 region and aa1319-1327 (HR2-1), aa1337-1345 (HR2-3 and HR2-4), aa1349-1357 (HR2-5), and aa1406-1414 (HR2-11) of the HR2 region. Among these peptides, HR2-4 and HR2-11 induced IFN-\u03b3 production in this experiment. This suggests that these two peptides are MHC class Ibinding peptides with the Tc1 epitope. The other peptides, HR1-7, HR1-14, and IH-2, have the Th1 epitope.Like the sites of Th1 epitopes in FIPV identified in this study, SARS-CoV contains Th1/Tc1 epitopes in the HR1, IH, and HR2 regions of the S2 domain (22) (23) (24) . Among these, Th1/Tc1 epitopes (SSp-1) present in the HR2 region are known to induce strong CTL activity and are regarded as candidates for vaccine development. Thus, the peptides with Th1/Tc1 epitopes identified in this study, particularly HR2-4 and HR2-11 that seem to have Tc1 epitopes, are potential candidates for vaccine development for prevention of FIPV infection.Although Th1/Tc1 epitopes in the FP-HR2 region appeared to strongly induce the Th1-type immune response in a mouse model, their effects in the cat remain unknown. It is important for an effective peptide-based vaccine against FIPV infection to include Th1/Tc1, but not ADE, epitopes. In the cat, the identification of Th1/Tc1 epitopes in the S2 domain of FIPV has important implications. In the future, Th1/Tc1 epitopes in FIPV will be explored using FIPV-infected cats. The development of a vaccine against FIPV infection based on these epitopes is awaited.",
