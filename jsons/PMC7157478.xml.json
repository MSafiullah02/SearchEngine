            "text": "In 2007, the National Institutes of Health\u2013sponsored IPF Clinical Network and clinical experts proposed a consensus definition and diagnostic criteria for AE-IPF (Collard et al., 2007). The criteria included a clinical worsening of less than 30 days duration, the presence of new radiologic abnormalities on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with bilateral ground-glass opacification/consolidation, and the exclusion of alternative etiologies. Endobronchial aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was recommended to exclude potential infectious etiologies and \u201csuspected AE-IPF\u201d was proposed in cases of missing data (Collard et al., 2007). These consensus criteria were originally proposed to standardize the inclusion criteria for future research. However, performing bronchoscopy is often not clinically feasible in patients with significant hypoxemia and even when it is performed, it frequently cannot confidently exclude an underlying infection. Furthermore, the evidence demonstrated that AE-IPF had similar clinical features and prognosis compared with nonidiopathic causes of acute respiratory worsening in IPF (e.g., infection or aspiration) (Song et al., 2011; Collard et al., 2013). Therefore, in 2016, an International Working Group published a revised definition of AE-IPF (Collard et al., 2016). In the current guidelines, AE-IPF is now defined by a clinically significant respiratory deterioration developing within typically less than 1 month, accompanied by new radiologic abnormalities on HRCT such as diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacification with or without consolidation, and the absence of other obvious clinical causes like fluid overload, left heart failure, or pulmonary embolism. In the revised definition, the term \u201cidiopathic\u201d was omitted to allow for a broader inclusion of exacerbation, including those that may be triggered, thus enabling future researchers to better understand AE-IPF and to find effective therapies for this condition. The clinical scenarios that should be excluded, \u201cfluid overload, left heart failure, or pulmonary embolism,\u201d are mentioned because these conditions have a different prognosis and require different therapy compared to AE-IPF. The new definition promotes discrimination between a triggered form of AE-IPF (e.g., infection, postprocedural/postoperative or drug toxicity) and an idiopathic form of AE-IPF, where no trigger is identified (Table 1\n).",

            "text": "The reported incidence of AE is highly variable from less than 1% to almost half of patients with IPF, due to the different criteria and different patient populations studied. As shown in Table 2\n, the incidence of AE in the placebo arm of most randomized controlled trials (RCT) was low, > 1\u20135%, in contrast to 5\u201328% 1-year incidence of retrospective cohort studies (Collard et al., 2016). In earlier RCTs, AE was not predefined or listed as a secondary end point, therefore the incidence was mentioned occasionally and only as acute decompensation, acute worsening or acute respiratory failure. Most of the RCTs were performed on mild to moderate severity of IPF without significant comorbidities. In contrast, poor lung function is the most consistent risk factor of AE in the cohort studies. Therefore, the incidence of AE in the RCT may be lower than the incidence in general patient population due to exclusion of IPF patients with more severe disease. Further, the definition of AE is important; in a post hoc analysis of the Sildenafil Trial of Exercise Performance in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (STEP-IPF) (Zisman et al., 2010), definite AE-IPF occurred in 4 per 100 patient-years, but combining definite and suspected AE-IPF increased the incidence to 20 per 100 patient-years (Collard et al., 2013). The annual rate of AE in a registry-based US study was even lower, 0.13 per patient-year (Fernandez Perez et al., 2010).",

There are some who suggest that advanced disease itself may not increase the real incidence, but increases the chance for recognition due to more symptoms and signs in the patients with already poor physiologic reserve. However, this higher occurrence of AE in the patients with lower lung function was seen not only in cohort studies, but has also been observed in RCTs. In the INPULSIS trials, where AE-IPF was a secondary end point, the 1-year-incidence of AE in patients with a FVC of < 70% predicted was 14.9%, but in those with an FVC > 70% predicted the incidence was 3.3% (Costabel et al., 2016). Also a meta-analysis of six RCTs showed that AE occurred less frequently in trials excluding severe disease (28.2 vs. 122.9 AE/1000 patient years\u20131, P < 0.0001) (Atkins et al., 2014). In the INPULSIS-ON study (the open-label extension of the INPULSIS trials), a post hoc subgroup analysis demonstrated that the progression of disease and fatal events were more frequent in the subgroup of patients with more severe disease (FVC \u2264 50% at the start of the extension phase) than in patients with a less severe disease, although the difference was not statistically significant (Wuyts et al., 2016).",

Many studies report that AE occurred more frequently in winter and spring months (Simon-Blancal et al., 2012; Costabel et al., 2016; Oda et al., 2016) and in patients taking immunosuppressive medications. One large study of 220 patients with ILD (100 cases of IPF, 120 cases of non-IPF) showed that 20% of patients were diagnosed with an infection in the setting of an acute respiratory worsening (Moua et al., 2016, #138). Although these accompanying clinical features suggest an infectious etiology, efforts to prove infection in AE-IPF have not been successful. Wootton et al. (2011) tested BAL fluid and serum from patients with AE-IPF, stable IPF, and those with acute lung injury (ALI) without IPF for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Of the 43 patients with AE-IPF, only four had the evidence of a common respiratory virus (parainfluenza, rhinovirus [n = 2], and coronavirus). No viruses were detected in the stable IPF patients. Additional pan-viral microarrays revealed evidence of nonrespiratory viruses in 15 patients with AE-IPF: herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and torque teno virus (TTV) (n\n = 12). TTV was found in similar percentages (24%) of patients with ALI. The clinical significance of TTV remains to be determined. Konishi et al. also failed to identify any gene transcription profiles that would be expected in a viral infection, in both patients with AE-IPF and stable IPF (Konishi et al., 2009). In a prospective study of C. pneumoniae infection triggering AE-IPF, only two patients had an antibody response (Tomioka et al., 2007), suggesting that Chlamydophila is an unlikely trigger for AE-IPF.",

Due to the relative insidious onset of AE (up to 30 days), any triggering viruses would likely no longer be detectable by the time of clinical presentation of AE, leaving only the acute lung injury pattern with aggravation or acceleration of the underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD). Also, the detection of infection is difficult even with invasive procedures. Autopsy studies found that 28.8% of patients with AE-IPF had a bronchopneumonia (fungal: 13.5%; cytomegalovirus: 11.5%; and bacterial: 9.6%) identified postmortem, but were clinically unsuspected, highlighting difficulties in diagnosing infection in this setting (Oda et al., 2014). A recent study of 119 bronchoscopies performed in 106 ILD patients presenting with acute respiratory failure showed that only 16 of 119 (13%) revealed a potential cause of respiratory worsening (Arcadu and Moua, 2017). Furthermore, identifying infection has not yet been demonstrated to affect outcomes, despite the treatment of microorganisms identified by BAL fluid, a fatal outcome eventually occurred and mortality remained high (Blivet et al., 2001).",

Integrated analysis of the host transcriptome and microbial signatures demonstrate an interaction between host and environment in IPF. The response to an altered and more abundant microbiome remains during longitudinal follow-up, suggesting that the bacterial communities of the lower airways may act as a persistent stimulus for repetitive alveolar injury in IPF (Molyneaux et al., 2017b). In the BAL fluid of AE-IPF, bacterial burden was also increased compared to stable IPF, with an increase in Campylobacter sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp., as well as a significant decrease in Veillonella sp. compared to stable IPF (Molyneaux et al., 2017a).

Animal studies have demonstrated that the instillation of acid or gastric juice provoked the diffuse alveolar damage pattern, which is the pathologic pattern of AE-IPF. Further, Lee et al. reported that in the placebo arm of three RCTs (STEP-IPF, ACE-IPF and PANTHER-IPF), patients taking anti-acid therapy at baseline had a slower decline in FVC (over 30-weeks of \u20130.06 L vs. \u20130.12 L, P = 0.05) and fewer AE (no events versus nine events, P < 0.01) during the study period (Lee et al., 2013).

In 10 of 15 patients who developed AE (67%), the ground glass opacities (GGO) was virtually unilateral, occurring in the most affected lung by IPF (in most cases, right side). This suggests that loco-regional factors, including GER, may be responsible for both the asymmetry and the occurrence of AE (Tcherakian et al., 2011). However, later, Callahan reported that no statistically significant difference in the number of AE (43% vs. 39%, P = 0.824) and GER (both groups 50%) was observed in 14 asymmetric cases of IPF compared to 28 controls (Callahan et al., 2016). These data should be interpreted with caution; the numbers of subjects were smaller and the incidence of AE in symmetric IPF group seemed to be relatively high (39%) compared to most other reports. Only three of 14 patients in the asymmetric group had strictly unilateral involvement and 9 of 14 patients had left lung dominant disease.",

Considering the potential side effects associated with long term PPI use (Freedberg et al., 2017) and an increased risk of infections, including pulmonary infections, observed in many reports (Kreuter et al., 2016b; Costabel et al., 2018), a well-designed, prospective RCT is required to understand the relationship between GER and IPF and also to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of PPIs/antacids and antireflux surgery for IPF. A recent single-center, double blind RCT of omeprazole in IPF (Dutta et al., 2019) suggested some feasibility for a larger RCT, although the question of a gold standard method for the diagnosis of GER, especially for a large clinical RCT, remains.",

The patients with OP pattern and extensive fibroblastic foci appear to have better prognosis (Churg et al., 2007) and Akira et al. reported that the patients with these OP or extensive fibroblastic foci had a peripheral type of GGO on HRCT. The findings on surgical lung biopsies are different from autopsy specimens (Oda et al., 2014). In autopsy specimens, UIP was seen in all, DAD in 78.8%, pulmonary hemorrhage in 28.8%, thromboembolism in 17.8% and lung cancer in 11.5%. In addition, 28.8% showed bronchopneumonia, but OP without DAD was found in only 1.9%, which might be related to better prognosis with an OP pattern and consequently seen less frequent at autopsy. Recently Balestero et al. performed morphometric analysis on explanted lung specimens of 41 patients with IPF, including 11 AE-IPF, and compared pathologic findings with clinical disease progression. Prominent cellular inflammatory infiltrates with a number of both innate (neutrophil, macrophage) and adaptive inflammatory infiltrate (CD4, CD 8, B cell) was significantly higher in the acute exacerbators and rapid progressors compared to the slow progressors. The slow progressors who developed AE showed a more marked increase in overall inflammation (CD45 +) than the slow progressors who did not develop AE. Indeed, the degree of inflammation in the rapid progressors who did not exacerbate was similar to that in the acute exacerbator. Interestingly, DAD, that is considered a characteristic feature of AE, was also found to the same extent in rapid progressors who did not exacerbate (Balestro et al., 2016).",

However, none of them have been properly validated in prospective studies and biomarkers currently do not impact clinical decision making in AE (Kondoh et al., 2017). KL-6 is a mucin-like glycoprotein, which is mainly expressed in type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells (Kohno et al., 1989). It is detected in regenerating type II cells (Kohno et al., 1989) and has been widely used in Japan as a serum marker of predicting the disease course and development of AE-IPF (Ohshimo et al., 2014). Recently, Maher et al. found that SP-D and CA19-9 were the most discriminatory biomarkers in 106 patients with IPF and validated in 206 patients enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of incident cases of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (PROFILE) study. Baseline values of SP-D (46.6 ng mL\u20131 vs. 34.6 ng mL\u20131, P = .0.0018) and CA19-9 (53.7 UmL\u20131 vs. 22.2 UmL\u20131; P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in patients with stable disease, and rising concentrations of CA-125 over 3 months were associated with increased risk of mortality (HR 2.542, 95% CI: 1.493\u20134.328, P = 0.00059), but the association with AE is unknown (Maher et al., 2017).",

The 3 month-survival rate in the tacrolimus group was 80% with a median survival of 92 days, which was higher than the control group (10%, 38 days). No surviving patients from the tacrolimus group had a reexacerbation for at least 6 months after their initial AE, whereas four of the nontacrolimus group patients died from reexacerbation between 1 and 4.5 months after their initial AE (Horita et al., 2011).",

This is based on the high in-hospital mortality observed in AE-IPF, up to 90% (Mallick, 2008). Because the fibrotic noncompliant lung is more susceptible to ventilator-induced lung injury, a protective ventilation (i.e., low tidal volume) strategy, NIV (Mollica et al., 2010; Tomii et al., 2010; Vianello et al., 2014), or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (Koyauchi et al., 2018; Faverio et al., 2018) may reduce the risk. Rush et al. analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the United States, and found that invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) had a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to NIV (51.6% with IMV vs. 30.9% in NIV, P < 0.0001) among 2481 patients with IPF (Rush et al., 2016).

Recent advances in the technique has enabled ambulatory ECMO or awake, spontaneous breathing ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation and have shown encouraging results (Garcia et al., 2010; Hakim et al., 2018). Because ECMO cannot reverse the original prognosis, it is appropriate to consider ECMO only for the lung transplantation candidate (Trudzinski et al., 2016). Even with ECMO, the prognosis of these patients is worse than that of lung transplantation in stable IPF patients. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible patients with IPF need to have transplant evaluations early in the course of their disease, before an episode of AE-IPF.",

However, a prespecified sensitivity analysis of pooled data from INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2 demonstrated that nintedanib significantly delayed the time to first adjudicated AE-IPF (either confirmed or suspected) compared to placebo (hazard ratio: 0.32, P = 0.001). A separate pooled analysis of all three trials (TOMORROW and INPULSIS-1 and 2) demonstrated a reduction in centrally adjudicated confirmed or suspected AE-IPF with nintedanib therapy (5.9% on placebo vs. 2.2% on nintedanib, P = 0.01) (Collard et al., 2017). However, these results need to be interpreted with caution as the number of events was relatively small and no significant differences in mortality were observed between investigator reported AE, adjudicated AE and adjudicated as not-AE (other forms of acute respiratory worsening) (Collard et al., 2017). The time to first adjudicated AE-IPF in the prespecified pooled analysis (INPULSIS-1 and 2) and the time to first investigator-reported AE-IPF in a separate pooled analysis of all three trials (TOMORROW and INPULSIS-1 and 2) demonstrated a delay in those randomized to nintedanib.",
