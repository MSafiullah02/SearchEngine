The current study compares the clinical courses between patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS and those with H1N1-induced ARDS. We found that, compared with features in patients with H1N1, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to exhibit nonproductive cough with obvious constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, GI symptoms, and a prevalence in the elderly. In addition, imaging results more commonly presented as ground-glass opacities in patients with COVID-19. However, although the conditions of patients with H1N1 seemed to be more critical than those of patients with COVID-19, there was no difference in the prognoses between ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 vs those infected with H1N1.",

Similar to H1N1, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits prevalent human-to-human transmission through close contact, and its basic reproductive number is estimated to be 2.2.3 However, the basic reproductive number estimated during the H1N1 outbreak in Mexico in 2009 ranged from 1.3 to 1.7.12 Acute respiratory infection is always the initial manifestation of these two respiratory infectious diseases. Because of their different therapies, prognoses, and protective measures, it is important to differentiate these two diseases via early clinical presentations. The current study revealed that COVID-19 manifested as nonproductive cough with nonspecific systemic symptoms, which is consistent with previous studies. Wang et al13 analyzed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and reported that fever, fatigue, and dry cough were the most common symptoms, and that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days. However, in addition to fever and productive cough, rhinorrhea is more common in patients with H1N1, and the median incubation period of this virus is 2 days.9 Therefore, we speculate from previous research and our current findings that COVID-19 infection may present as a slow onset with fewer productive coughs and more obvious systemic symptoms compared with the clinical presentations of H1N1 infection.",

In contrast to definitive treatment measures for H1N1,19 there is no evidence to approve the effectiveness of any therapy for COVID-19. More than one hundred clinical studies have been conducted by Chinese researchers, and the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for COVID-19 drug treatments.20 The application of glucocorticoids was common in both COVID-19 and H1N1 patients in the current study, but the proportion in COVID-19 patients was greater than that in H1N1 patients. However, there was no difference in the dosage or duration of glucocorticoids between these two groups. The observational data currently available suggest that glucocorticoids for the treatment of respiratory infections increase mortality and secondary infection rates in influenza, impair clearance of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and complicate corticosteroid therapies in survivors.21 Therefore, indications for glucocorticoids should be carefully evaluated in such patients.",

From the adjusted mortality analysis, we found that patients with H1N1 had a significantly worse prognosis than patients with COVID-19. All of the included COVID-19 cases in the current study were at the early stage of this epidemic. The rapidly growing cases of unknown diseases, inadequate responses, insufficient medical staff, and lack of medical supplies have adversely affected the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, as a novel respiratory infectious disease, the relatively higher mortality rate of COVID-19 cases is to be expected.
