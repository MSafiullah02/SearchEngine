            "text": "The largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in known history began in West Africa in December 2013 and has just recently come to an end. The outbreak resulted in 28,616 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of the disease and left 11,310 people dead.1 Although cases were primarily limited to Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, isolated travel- and health care-associated cases were reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.2 At the peak of the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the World Health Organization released guidelines for the management of patients with known or suspected EVD for health care workers in the United States, Canada, and those working in affected areas in Africa,3, 4, 5 requiring North American hospitals to undertake comprehensive efforts to plan and train for this potential need. It is not known how North American health care facilities selected and trained their physician staff to care for persons under investigation (PUIs) for and patients with EVD and to whom EVD preparedness planning responsibilities were delegated. Developing an understanding of physicians' roles in EVD preparedness planning and the care of PUIs and patients with EVD will allow more specific recommendations and workforce estimates to be generated for future use in preparedness planning for novel pathogens. Here we describe selected physician contributions to EVD preparedness planning and the care of PUIs or patients with EVD, as determined by voluntary survey.",

The convenience sample of hospital epidemiologists and infectious disease physicians was obtained from a circulating listserve that includes a preponderance of academic institutions, including a majority of those institutions designated as Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs). This sample was expanded to known colleagues who were not included on the listserve. QuestionPro (Seattle, WA) was used to generate and distribute the survey and store response data. The survey was developed specifically for purposes of this study and included 24 questions, which are delineated in Table 1\n. Data were de-identified before analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. The University of Virginia Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research reviewed the methods and questionnaire and deemed this study exempt from institutional review board approval.",

Maunder et al6 found that health care workers in Toronto, the center of the outbreak in North America, reported higher levels of burnout, psychological distress, and posttraumatic stress than a comparator group. Interestingly, the various forms of distress were increased in Toronto health care workers irrespective of their degree of contact with actual SARS patients, indicating that institutional factors played a role, not simply the stress of caring for such patients.6 The authors found that perceived adequacy of training and moral support were protective factors against psychological distress.6 A study of nurse leaders involved in the care of SARS patients in Taiwan7 also identified several factors that were believed to be helpful in relieving the stress of caring for such patients: psychological support from other clinicians, health professionals, and the public; stress management techniques; counseling and referral services; and the assurance of availability of personal protective equipment. Additionally, these nurse leaders reported that improvements in self-learning and problem-solving competency and acknowledgements by patients, higher authorities, and national organizations contributed to a sense of reward from their experience with SARS.7\n",
