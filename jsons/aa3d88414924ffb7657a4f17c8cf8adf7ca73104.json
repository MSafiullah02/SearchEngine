            "text": "22 Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, 23 and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To 24 overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We 25 provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal 26 changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female 27 ferrets (n=39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were 28 weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the 29 winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, 30 while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals 31 varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated 32 with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such 33 that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long term average 34 weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water 35 regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight 36 changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5 day water 37 regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative 38 benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into 39 the health assessment of an animal's condition. 4 62 hours can be easily regulated and are often set at a 12-hour light cycle (12-hours ON, 12-63 hours OFF) or synchronised with the external environment; for example, varying from a 64 minimum 8-hour cycle in winter (8-hours ON, 16-hours OFF) to maximum 16-hour cycle 65 in summer (16-hours ON, 8-hours OFF) [18-21]. Variation in the photoperiod can change 66 factors such as eating habits, coat thickness, sleep and activity levels -all of which may 67 contribute to normal and possible abnormal weight changes. Previous research has 68 demonstrated that ferret weights increase as hours of daylight decrease, leading to 69 sinusoidal weight fluctuations with annual light cycle [22,23]. Contrastingly, in another 70 study where the sleep habits of two male ferrets were tracked, light/dark schedule was 71",

            "text": "313 When modelling weight changes in the winter the intercept was significant (beta = 1.38, 314 table 2), suggesting that typically animals gained 1.38% of their body weight weekly in 315 winter, and the week was also a significant predictor (beta = -0.065) indicating that 316 animals initially gained weight more rapidly. In summer the intercept was again significant 317 (beta = -0.73) and the only other significant predictor was whether the animal had been 318 on regulation the previous week (beta = -0.82, indicating that animals who had access to 319 free water in the previous week lost more weight than those who had not had access to 320 free water). In summary therefore, it is possible to estimate typical patterns of weight loss 321 / gain that should occur over the course of a week but data such as that shown in Figure   322 6C,D demonstrate that each animal must really be assessed individually (ideally in 323 comparison to its own historic data) in the context of other factors. Table 2 326 Final models for estimating the % change in body weight from week n to n+1. The number of weeks since 327 transition, the animals mean body weight and whether the animal had been water regulated in week n-1 20 328 were considered as factors, with only the number of weeks since transition being predictive for the 329 summer data, and whether the animal had been on water regulation or not the previous week influencing 330 the summer data.",

Since the key contributor to weight loss in water 369 regulated animals is thought to be reluctance to eat dry food (rather than dehydration per 370 se) providing animals with water combined with ground pellet diet to form a mash [8] 371 appears to be successful at ensuring weight loss does not exceed more than a few 372 percent. Food and water restriction are common methods used as motivation to train 373 many laboratory animals including ferrets, rats and mice in tasks for research [35] and 374 weight loss is a key marker of health status. Understanding how seasonal fluctuations 375 interact with these effects is therefore important to refine health assessment and ensure 376 the highest standards of animal welfare.",

For each animal and season for which we had at 165 least 8 weeks of data, we performed a linear regression to determine the relationship 166 between time (in weeks) and body weight (Fig. 2A-B). In summer, there was a statistically167 significant relationship between time and body weight during the summer period for all 168 animals (51 animal x transition combinations, 33 unique animals measured across one or 169 more seasonal transition; R 2 (mean; min to max) = 0.59; 0.07 to 0.96, p < 0.05 (49/51 170 p<0.001).

We, therefore, used the resulting regression coefficients (\u03b2) to 173 determine the predicted weight change per week. We expressed weights in grams (Fig. 174 2C-D) and also relative to their starting weight (Fig. 2E-F). Measuring weight changes in 175 this way allowed us to see a highly stereotyped pattern of weight loss/ gain.

Very few of our observed weight measurements fell within the 272 predicted confidence limits (~10% of all data). Examination of the observed and predicted 273 values revealed that while the models predicted the key trends, they poorly captured the 274 extent of the variability occurring within individual animals over time. In Figure 6, four 275 example animals are shown -the first two animals show what is typical of most of our 276 animals which is that the model captures the trend but not the details, whereas the second 277 two animals show very different patterns of weight loss which, while quite different from 278 most animals is highly consistent within that individual.

The animals in A and B show the typical near-linear pattern of weight loss 286 over time, the shape of which is well captured by the predictions. However, rarely are the observed 287 values within the predicted range by the model. In animal A, the fluctuation in weight due to water 288 regulation is underestimated, and in one year weight loss was more rapid than the model predicted, while 289 in B, the animal varies very little while on water regulation and therefore the fluctuations are over 290 estimated. For this animal the model also underestimates the gradient of weight loss through the summer.291 Most animals looked like those in A and B, however a few animals had substantially different patterns 292 which were highly consistent within each animal from year to year. Both animals in C and D show a 293 pattern of weight loss which is not linear (and therefore unsurprisingly poorly modelled). Animal F1610 (C)",

This pattern of seasonal 355 weight change demonstrated by our ferrets follows previously observed changes [22]. The range of mean weights that we observed across our population were in keeping with 357 previously reported data [20,29,33]. There are many possible physiological contributing 358 factors to this seasonal weight loss including coat changes [22,26], fat storage, hormone 359 levels such as melatonin [26] and activity levels which in wild animals are critical for 360 survival [34]. Water regulation imposed an additional pattern of weight changes on animals; 362 weight was lost over the week in both summer and winter. On average, between Monday 363 morning (when water bottles had been removed the previous evening) and Friday 364 morning animals lost around 3% of their body weight in winter, and 4% in summer.
