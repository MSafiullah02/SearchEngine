In addition to the replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and structural proteins (spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E)) which are common to all members of the coronavirus genus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome also encodes eight accessory proteins, i.e. open reading frames (ORFs) 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b, varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids (Marra et al. 2003; Snijder et al. 2003). While the SARS-CoV replicase gene products and structural proteins share some degree of sequence homology with those of other coronaviruses, the accessory proteins do not show significant homology to viral proteins of known coronaviruses. Indeed, many laboratories have performed molecular and biochemical characterization of these accessory proteins (Tan et al. 2006; Narayanan et al. 2008), as a better understanding of these unique SARS-CoV proteins may offer clues as to why the SARS-CoV causes such a severe and rapid attack in humans while other coronaviruses that infect humans seem to be more forgiving.",

In one of these studies, Guan and coworkers analysed SARS-CoV isolates obtained from animals in a live-market in Guangdong and found that all the animal isolates contained a 29-nucleotide (nt) sequence which is absent in most of the human isolates (Guan et al. 2003) (Fig. 12.1a). As a result of this, the ORF8a and ORF8b (also termed as ORF10 and ORF11 respectively) in the human isolates become one ORF, termed as ORF8ab. ORF8ab encodes a protein of 122 amino acids, whose N terminus is identical to ORF8a and C terminus is identical to ORF8b (Fig. 12.1b). For simplification, we shall term the isolates obtained from wet-market animals as animal SARS-CoVs and those without the additional 29-nt in the ORF8 region as human SARS-CoVs.\n",

Although the mutations in the ORF8 region do not appear to have any adverse effect on the survival of the virus, it is conceivable that the ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab proteins have different stabilities and/or functions, and hence would contribute differently to viral replication and/or pathogenesis in vivo. In order to understand how the variations in the ORF8 region of the viral genome may influence SARS-CoV infection, we will discuss the genetic variations in the ORF8 region, expression of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab during infection, cellular localization and posttranslational modification of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab, participation of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab in viral\u2013viral interactions, their effects on other viral proteins and impact on viral replication and/or pathogenesis.",

Thus, genetic and epidemiological studies yield valuable insights on how viruses cross the species barrier and evolve to cause disease in humans. Indeed, such studies conducted on the SARS-CoV have revealed that this virus crossed the animal\u2013human barrier recently (Donnelly et al. 2004; Guan et al. 2003; Lau et al. 2005; Song et al. 2005). Large genetic variations have also been found in the ORF8 region. Interestingly, the animal strains of SARS-CoV, isolated from a raccoon dog and palm civets in markets/restaurants and from wild bats, contain an extra 29-nt in the ORF8 region (Guan et al. 2003; Lau et al. 2005).",

            "text": "Another extensive study of 63 SARS-CoV isolates obtained from the SARS epidemic in China also showed that there are major variations in this region of the viral genome (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004). In this study, the course of the epidemic was divided into the early, middle and late phases with the early phase defined as the period of first emergence of SARS in Guangdong Province, China, 2002. The middle phase referred to all events up to the first cluster of SARS cases in the Metropole hotel in Hong Kong and the late phase referred to all cases following this cluster. Interestingly, the clustering of patients with different patterns of variation in ORF8 region was correlated with the different phases of the epidemic. The 29-nt sequence is not found in all the human strains that were isolated in the middle phase of the epidemic but is present in most of the human isolates from the early phase. Indeed, human infection in the early phase probably represents the first breach of the animal\u2013human barrier as these isolates share the closest phylogenetic relationship with the animal isolates. These findings were subsequently verified by researchers who studied the SARS-CoVs isolated in different countries (Lan et al. 2005; Qin et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2005).",

These patients did not have any contact history with previously documented SARS cases. Sequence analysis of viruses isolated from these patients showed that they were not derived from the preceding epidemic in 2003 but rather suggested that these cases represented new zoonotic transmissions (Song et al. 2005).

However, during infection in humans, the deletion of the 29-nt seems to occur quickly. Besides this deletion, other types of deletion close to or within the ORF8 region have also been reported. For example, the viruses isolated from some patients in Hong Kong were found to contain a deletion of 386-nt that flanks the 29-nt site (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004; Chiu et al. 2005). This causes the ORF7b to become smaller and eliminates both ORF8a and ORF8b. In addition, a frame-shift mutation in the ORF8a gene was also reported for two isolates that had been passaged in Vero E6 or FRhK4 cells (Poon et al. 2005). This mutation was not found in the original clinical samples, suggesting that this mutation was acquired as a result of cell culture adaptation. Interestingly, deletion mutations that lead to premature stop of the ORF8a protein have also been found in three other human isolates (Lan et al. 2005).",

In one study, two out of 37 patients were found to have anti-ORF8a antibodies suggesting that ORF8a was expressed during infection in vivo (Chen et al. 2007). Since only 5.4% of the patients had anti-ORF8a antibodies, this suggests that ORF8a may be expressed at low levels or that it is not highly immunogenic. While this study used full-length ORF8a expressed in bacteria as well as mammalian cells to determine the presence of anti-ORF8a antibodies, another study used overlapping peptides of ORF8a instead (Guo et al. 2004). Here, they examined four pairs of acute and convalescent sera and found that two of the convalescent sera contained IgA antibodies against ORF8a while none of the acute sera had such antibodies. In the same study, no anti-ORF8b antibody was found.",

Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated with the HKU39849 Hong Kong isolate (unpublished data).

Since its translation initiation codon is not the first AUG in the subgenomic RNA8, ORF8b is likely to be expressed via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism or by a leaky ribosomal scanning mode of translation, as have been described for viral proteins encoded by other bicistonic or tricistronic coronaviral mRNAs (Liu and Inglis 1992; Senanayake and Brian 1997; Thiel and Siddell 1994). Thus, the recombinant vaccinia virus bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase expression system was further used to generate mRNA that mimics the subgenomic RNA8 generated in infected cells (Oostra et al. 2007). Again, ORF8b could not be expressed using this system, indicating that the human SARS-CoV may not contain an internal ribosomal entry site for the expression of ORF8b.

Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA level of E was not decreased in the presence of ORF8b, suggesting that the effect of ORF8b on the expression of the E protein is likely to be posttranslational. This finding was further confirmed by immunofluorescence studies which showed that the expressions of ORF8b and E in SARS-CoV infected cells were mutually exclusive (Keng et al. 2006). The effect of ORF8b on E can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that it involves the proteasome pathway (Le et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Although the coexpression of SARS-CoV E and M is sufficient for the assembly of viral-like particles in the baculovirus system (Ho et al. 2004; Mortola and Roy 2004), it was demonstrated by reverse genetic techniques that E is not essential for the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6, HuH-7 and CaCo-2 cells (DeDiego et al. 2007). However, the recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-DeltaE) grew to lower titers than the recombinant wild-type virus, indicating that the E protein has an effect on virus growth. In addition, the rSARS-CoV-DeltaE virus was found to be attenuated in both hamsters and transgenic mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2) (DeDiego et al. 2007, 2008), indicating that E is an important virulence factor. Based on this, it is attempting to speculate that the downregulation of E by ORF8b may have an effect on the virulence of SARS-CoV. However, this effect is likely to be only modulative as only a fraction of the infected cells expresses detectable levels of ORF8b (Keng et al. 2006). In order for ORF8b to be expressed via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism or by a leaky ribosomal scanning mode of translation (see Sect. 12.3.2), activation of certain host translational machineries may be necessary (Komar and Hatzoglou 2005; Stoneley and Willis 2004). Such activation may happen only in the fraction of the cells that is in a certain phase of the cell cycle or subjected to certain stimuli. This is probably why ORF8b can only be detected in a fraction of the SARS-CoV infected cells (Keng et al. 2006). Further experiments are needed to address this possibility and determine the temporal expression of ORF8b during the viral replication cycle. In addition, it was reported that over-expression of SARS-CoV E can induce apoptosis in T-cells (Yang et al. 2005), and thus the downregulation of E by ORF8b may also have an impact on viral pathogenesis.",

Although infection of the animals with BJ01 seems to result in higher average body temperature and stronger antibody responses, further experiments are required to confirm these observations. Using reverse genetic methods, Yount and coworkers created an Urbani strain with the 29-nt insertion so that the ORF8 of this human SARS-CoV became like the animal SARS-CoV (Yount et al. 2005). Consistent with Wu et al. 2005, their results show that this mutant virus replicates as well as the wild-type virus in mice, suggesting the 29-nt insertion does not enhance the replication of SARS-CoV in young mice, which cleared both viruses by day 7 postinfection.",

When HuH-7 cell lines stably expressing ORF8a were infected with SARS-CoV, higher viral loads and greater cytopathic effects were observed when compared to the original HuH-7 cells. In order to resolve the discrepancies between these observations, it is important to determine how much higher is the level of ORF8a in these stable cell lines compared to that expressed during SARS-CoV infection.

In addition, one of the most common abnormalities in SARS-CoV infected patients is lymphopenia (Peiris et al. 2003; Chng et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2006), which could be caused by the depletion of T lymphocytes by apoptosis.

The induction of apoptosis was dependent on viral replication and could be inhibited by caspase inhibitors or the over-expression of the prosurvival protein, Bcl-2 (Ren et al. 2005; Bordi et al. 2006). Furthermore, the over-expression of some of the SARS-CoV proteins can induce apoptosis and/or necrosis (Tan et al. 2007). Five of the accessory proteins, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF8a, have also been shown to induce apoptosis when they were over-expressed (Law et al. 2005; Tan et al. 2004; Yuan et al. 2005; Khan et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2008). In addition, ORF8a was found to be localized in the mitochondria (Chen et al. 2007).

Coexpression of ORF8b and ORF6 did not yield any synergistic effects, suggesting that they may function independently (Law et al. 2006).

Interestingly, the SARS-CoV isolated from humans infected during the peak of epidemic, encodes two accessory proteins termed as ORF8a and ORF8b while the SARS-CoV isolated from animals contains an extra 29-nt in this region such that these proteins are fused to become a single protein, ORF8ab. As described above, the accessory proteins ORF8a and ORF8b are expressed during infection in vitro, but replacing them with ORF8ab does not affect SARS-CoV replication in cell culture or small animal models. However, it is still not known if these proteins contribute to viral replication and/or pathogenesis in the natural host. Significant differences in the molecular and biochemical characteristics of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab have been observed but the impact on the function of these proteins remains unclear. Another unanswered question is why large genetic variations have occurred most frequently in this particular region of the viral genome.",

The animal isolates have an extra 29-nucleotide insertion such that the subgenomic RNA8 encodes for a single protein, termed ORF8ab, while that of the human isolates (from the middle phase) encodes two proteins, ORF8a and ORF8b. Human isolates from early phase of the epidemic also have the 29-nucleotide insertion found in the animal SARS-CoV. (b) Alignment of the protein sequences of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab. Mismatches between ORF8a and ORF8ab or ORF8b and ORF8ab are boxed. The predicted signal peptides in ORF8a and ORF8ab are underlined and the predicted N-glycosylation sites in these proteins are showed in bold. The ORF8ab is reconstructed from a human isolate from the middle phase (SIN2774) by insertion of the 29-nucletoides found in a human isolate from the early phase (GZ02).
