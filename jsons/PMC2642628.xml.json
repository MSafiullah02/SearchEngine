Malaria was found to be associated with neurological involvement on admission in nearly half of the patients (with an incidence of 47.6%), and their mortality was increased when compared to malaria patients without neurological signs. The main clinical features consist of seizures often preceding deep coma resulting from cerebral edema, microhemorrhages, and ischemia. Erythrocytes containing malaria parasites accumulate in brain microvessels where leucocytes and platelets are also found.",

This may result in activation of microglial cells and astrocytes, demyelination, and/or neuronal injury [3]. Important insights have come from clinical studies, post-mortem analyses of brains from CM victims, in vitro studies of the adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes to brain endothelial cells, and genetic studies of susceptibility and resistance determinants in mice and humans [3]. Balanced views on other aspects of CM pathogenesis and pathophysiology, including metabolic acidosis and capillary dysfunction, have been discussed by Idro et al.

Thus, in CM, inflammation and immune-mediated events remain essentially intravascular, in contrast to other neuroimmunological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, which is characterized by perivascular infiltrates and no intravascular sequestration of leucocytes. Furthermore, the Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes also remain intravascular, in contrast to the direct CNS invasion by other pathogens, such as in toxoplasmosis. Consequently, unless marked hemorrhages occur, there is a limited involvement of parasites or of leucocytes within the CNS parenchyma itself. It is not possible, however, to draw conclusions about a lack of inflammatory pathogenesis, because most, if not all, brain pathology is mediated by intravascular inflammatory events. Concerted interdisciplinary actions are needed to reach a better understanding of CM pathogenesis and the intricate roles of parasite-derived toxins, proinflammatory cytokines, and adhesion molecules. The discovery of increased numbers of endothelial cell membrane\u2013derived microparticles in the circulation during acute CM raises the question of their pathogenic role, as suggested by disease protection in mice lacking one of the genes controlling microparticle formation [4].",

However, the estimated number of cases may be ten times as many, although the number of newly detected cases has been declining during the last decade. The West African form is caused by Tb gambiense, with humans as the primary host and main reservoir, while the East African form is caused by Tb rhodesiense, with wild game or cattle as primary hosts. Both diseases are lethal when untreated, but their temporal profile differs; the West African form lasts several months or even years, whereas the East African form progresses more rapidly [8]. The widely used card agglutination test for screening of trypanosomiasis is only applicable to Tb gambiense infections but is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to be diagnostic [7].",

Can parasites \u201chide\u201d in the brain parenchyma behind the BBB before relapses occur in unsuccessfully treated patients? How do these extracellular parasites cause the severe neurological symptoms that are manifested most conspicuously in disrupted sleep patterns [9]? Are brain dysfunctions the cause of death in HAT? These questions are important for treatment. Although drugs are relatively effective in curing both forms of HAT early in infection, at later stages, when most patients seek medical help, only drugs that can have severe toxic side effects, such as the widely used arsenic compound melarsoprol, are available. There is, therefore, an urgent need for improving surveillance and diagnostic tools to identify early HAT infection in the field, as well as for new, nontoxic drugs designed to cure brain infections. These issues can be addressed by characterizing the molecules involved in trafficking of trypanosomes across the BBB and the effects on brain functions of molecules released during parasite\u2013immune cell interactions. The strategy of \u201cnew use for old drugs\u201d, i.e., prescriptions for neglected diseases of drugs marketed for other illnesses [10], should also be pursued to identify less toxic drugs to cure brain infections.",

This has been achieved by large-scale programs to halt transmission by eliminating populations of insect vectors (the blood-feeding \u201cassassin bugs\u201d, sub-family Triatominae), screening of blood donors and Chagasic mothers. According to the World Health Report 2004 [11], the disability adjusted life years for Chagas disease were 667,000 and the number of yearly deaths was 14,000 (compared with estimates for HAT of 1,525,000 and 48,000, respectively). Non-treated, the disease evolves in a slow and progressive way into autonomic system neuropathies causing fatal cardiomyopathy and megacolon syndromes in about 30% of the patients. Involvement of the CNS is infrequent, discrete, and non-specific, but in AIDS patients, meningo-encephalitis with parasites in glial cells has been documented [12]. A parasite-derived neurotropic factor that binds to the high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor TrkA (tropomyosin-related kinase A) may be involved in the pathogenesis of nervous system infection [13]. Reaching an international consensus on diagnostic and treatment procedures is a current priority.",

According to the World Health Organization, Japanese encephalitis is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with an annual incidence of 30,000\u201350,000 clinical cases. Changes in vector populations and in human association with reservoir hosts, and the appearance of new viral variants that are more virulent for humans or more efficiently transmitted, are associated with emerging viruses, half of which cause serious neurological diseases [20].",

However, modern transportation has introduced vectors that efficiently transmit arboviruses into new areas (e.g., the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus into North America and Europe). In many areas, pre-existing populations of competent vectors set the stage for successful establishment of viruses in new regions. Recent examples are the introduction of West Nile virus into North America, where susceptible vectors and hosts were abundant and rapid spread across the continent has resulted in more than 11,000 cases of CNS disease, and the arrival of a strain of Chikungunya virus adapted to Ae. albopictus in southern Europe. West Nile virus has the widest distribution of all flaviviruses, its range spanning Africa, North, Central, and South America, West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia [18]. Japanese encephalitis and Rift Valley fever viruses could easily follow the same pattern.",

Abstracts have been published in BMC Proceedings ([22]; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/2?issue=S1). We need to increase the awareness of the world's leading institutions on the impact and challenges in this field and to foster new research and training programs that will trigger new ideas to study the mechanisms of pathogen spreading and neural cell dysfunction in close contact with clinical research and surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious neurological diseases. Progress will depend on the development of a systemic approach based on cross-fertilization between clinicians studying disease mechanisms and scientists working on the life cycle and molecular makeup of neurotropic infectious agents and their vectors; between immunologists studying innate and adaptive immune responses to neurotropic pathogens and cell biologists investigating pathogen interactions with the BBB and neural cells; and between leaders in new technologies for diagnosis and therapies and medical anthropologists.",
