Near pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), resulting in 8096 infected cases and a 9.6% death rate, have provided unfortunate reminders their continued health risk and significant economic impact [6]. New research projects are being funded to investigate the different scales of threat, from the epidemiological spread of a virus in a population to its early phases of the infection in a cell culture. Among the papers published on this topic, in particular on the influenza virus [7], [8], [9], there are Bocharov's ODE model [10] and Beauchemin's CA model [3], [4], [11]. Both models described the dynamics of the influenza infection in the upper epithelial areas of the lungs and were validated by clinical data. Although they take into account the effect of the immune system on the dynamics of the disease, describing the infection until its final outcome (more than a week after the first infection), none of them analyzed which mechanisms where critical in the dynamics of the first and second round of infection. To understand the key mechanisms of viral respiratory diseases, we focus instead on early phases of viral infection by using in vitro experiments observing lung cells up to 24 h post infection (PI). The in vitro experiments provide measurements of virus titer, spatial characteristics of cell growth and, through green fluorescent protein (GFP) imaging, of the infection spread.",

The choice of a CA model was natural since the in vitro infections being studied use host lung cancer cell lines that form a fixed mono-layer in which spatially dependent aspects of infection may be present [12], [13]. We developed this computational model using the Multi-Agent System Visualization (MASyV) platform [3]. In contrast to previous models, we explicitly focus on the dynamics of virus spread on a population of cells, supported by experimental data from an in vitro model system. We also explicitly model the infectious viral particles as discrete entities, whereas in previous models the infection of cells followed simple CA rules depending on the states of neighboring cells. These viral particles are released by infected cells according to a specific function based on time post infection, and move over the well with a random walk algorithm. This representation allows us to model the mechanisms of virus spread in an environment where the virus is not confined and can also infect cells not adjacent to the infected ones.",

The \u223clog10\n 3 viral titer measurements at time points 0, 4 and 7 h post infection are residual virus left over from the initial infection after washing. We set the delay for release of new infectious viral particles to 7 h to represent the jump in observed virus titer between 7 and 12 h. Cells release virus particles according to a viral release function, described below. Virus particles are entities that diffuse from one lattice point to another according to a random walk algorithm (Section 2.4). These free-floating virus particles stochastically infect uninfected cells in a second round of infection. The CA lattice is therefore like a tissue of immobile cells with infective virions moving over it. We represent only infectious viral particles to relate their count in the model with the viral titer measured in terms of plaque forming unit per mL (PFU/mL). A PFU is a measure of the number of viral particles capable of forming plaques per unit of volume, thus only infectious particles are counted in the viral titer. The CA lattice is updated synchronously and the boundary conditions for both the epithelial and viral particles are periodic, i.e., epithelial cells and viral particles can grow or move outside the boundary of the virtual well. We use a Honeycomb neighborhood: each lattice site is considered adjacent to six sites and cells can replicate only if a neighboring site is empty or if it contains a dead cell. Only uninfected cells are allowed to replicate. When cells on the lattice are initialized all uninfected cells are stochastically assigned a TIME_TO_DEATH value between 1 and an arbitrary CELL_LIFESPAN variable. CELL_LIFESPAN was chosen to be large enough such that 5%, a minority of the cells, die naturally within the simulated 24 h. CELL_LIFESPAN is not affected by infection as in vitro experimental observations showed no increase in cell death due to infection within 24 h.",

Cell density directly affects local cell growth since cells completely surrounded by other cells are not able to replicate. For this reason in our model the initial spatial distribution of uninfected cells affects the overall cell growth on the virtual culture well. In order to obtain a correct cell growth in our model we included a parameter called DIVISION_TIME that indicates the time necessary for a single uninfected cell to duplicate given an empty neighboring lattice site. We adjusted DIVISION_TIME to match the simulated doubling time with the experimentally derived doubling time by analyzing cell growth of uninfected cells over 48 h as a function of time for different DIVISION_TIME values (Fig. 4\n). This led us to fix the value of DIVISION_TIME to 10 h.",

By definition the proportion of infected cells is given by the Poisson distribution that describes the infection process [14]. Using the experimental MOI would theoretically give us the exact percentage of infected cells at the beginning of the experiment but even though the number of particles can be measured with good accuracy not all the viral particles used in this first infection process are infectious and the MOI estimate is derived using VeroE6 cells. These two complications require us to define an effective MOI, that is the MOI given by the number of particles able to truly infect the Calu-3 host cells. Initially viral particles infect a proportion of the plated Calu-3 cells before being washed away.

The probability that one or more infectious viral particles are released in each time step is given by V(t) (Eq. (3)). In this equation t represents time since the cell was infected and parameters A, B, and C are derived by fitting an experimentally derived viral release curve produced by Ka-Wai et al. [15].
