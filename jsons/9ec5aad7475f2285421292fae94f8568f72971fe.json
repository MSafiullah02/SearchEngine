In each of the three steps of information transfer-DNA replication, transcription, and translation-biochemical mechanisms have evolved that ensure production of a faithful copy of the template. Errors in translation are of two kinds: processivity failures (the failure to complete a chain) and misreading (incorporating an incorrect amino acid) (Kurland, 1992) . Each type of error occurs rarely, and the aggregate error rate during translation probably does not exceed 5 x 10-4. Among processivity errors, frameshift errors probably occur most infrequently, at rates estimated as less than 5 x 1O-5 per codon (Kurland, 1992) . This low frequency of random error reflects the fact that frame maintenance occupies a central position in the mechanism of elongation. The interaction between successive tRNAs bound to the mRNA in the ribosomal decoding sites, the A and P sites, defines the 3 nt translational step size, the codon (Atkins et al., 1991; Curran and Yarus, 1987; Smith and Yarus, 1989) .

All programed frameshifts consist of two elements, a recoding site (Gesteiand et al., 1992) which allows nontriplet decoding of the mRNA, and a stimulator (Atkins et al., 1990) which increases the efficiency of recoding. Recoding sites exist that shift the reading frame in the upstream, or minus, and downstream, or plus, direction. The most common types of frameshifts shift either -1 or +l, but other events result in shifts of multiple nucieotides in either direction (translational hops). in previously described +l and -1 frameshifts and translational hops, the recoding site consists of alternative cognate or near-cognate codons. A ribosome-bound tRNA slips from the codon in the upstream frame onto an out-of-frame codon. Translation then continues in the new translational reading frame with the production of a translational fusion of two reading frames. In the best known example of frameshifting, retroviral -1 frameshifting, the slip site consists of a heptameric site on which two tRNAs bound to nucleotides 2 to 7 simultaneously slip onto nucleotides 1 to 6. A secondary structure, commonly a pseudoknot, stimulates the event at least partially by causing a translational pause analogous to that produced by hungry codons, as has recently been demonstrated biochemically (Tu et al., 1992) . Such frameshift sites have been found in retroviruses, coronaviruses, retrotransposons, bacterial transposons, and a prokaryotic gene (for a review see ten Dam et al., 1990) . A second common form of frameshift site found in prokaryotes consists of a slippery sequence followed by an in-frame termination codon. The canonical example of such a site is from the Escherichia coii release factor 2 gene (Craigen and Caskey, 1986) . A +l frameshift occurs at a slippery codon stimulated by a combination of an adjacent in-frame termination codon and a Shine-Daigarno interaction between 16s rRNA and a sequence upstream of the shift site (Craigen and Caskey, 1986; Curran and Yarus, 1988; Weiss et al., 1988a; Weiss et al., 1987; Williams et al., 1989) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 148, "text": "Atkins et al., 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 149, "end": 172, "text": "Gesteland et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 173, "end": 185, "text": "Jacks, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 255, "end": 279, "text": "(Gesteiand et al., 1992)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 343, "end": 364, "text": "(Atkins et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1475, "end": 1492, "text": "(Tu et al., 1992)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1668, "text": "Dam et al., 1990)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1921, "text": "(Craigen and Caskey, 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2155, "text": "(Craigen and Caskey, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2179, "text": "Curran and Yarus, 1988;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2200, "text": "Weiss et al., 1988a;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2220, "text": "Weiss et al., 1987;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2243, "text": "Williams et al., 1989)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We previously described a +l frameshift in the overlap between the TYA and TYB genes of Tyl retrotransposons in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990 ).

We describe here an unusual frameshift system from the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast, a distant relative of Tyl . Ty3 encodes two genes, termed GAG3 and POL3 by analogy to the retroviral genes to which they are functionally related. POL3 is expressed as a fusion to the upstream GAG3 gene (Kirchner et al., 1992) . We show here that translational frameshifting within the 38 nt overlap between the genes produces the GAG3-POL3 fusion protein. The last 18 nt of the overlap promotes frameshifting with wild-type efficiency, about 10%. Sequencing of the protein product across this region and targeted mutagenesis indicate that this programed frameshift is unlike others previously characterized. The event does not require slippage of a tRNA at the site of frameshifting; asimilar mechanism is proposed for afortuitous, very low level frameshift that can be stimulated artificially by amino acid starvation (Peter et al., 1992; Weiss et al., 1988b) . In addition, the Ty3 frameshift is unlike a translational hop. In both characterized translational hops recoding occurs by the repositioning of peptidyl-tRNAfrom a conventionally decoded codon to the start of the shifted reading frame (Benhar and Engelberg, 1993; Weiss et al., 1990) .

It is interesting that the codons involved in these two mechanisms are so closely related, differing only in the wobble position, though encoding different amino acids. It is tempting to speculate that, though the retrotransposons are only distantly related (Hansen et al., 1988) , the two frameshift sites may have diverged from a common progenitor that used one or the other of these codons. We note that, in our previous analysis of Tyl frameshifting, no codon other than AGG could subsitute to allow high level (-20%) frameshifting (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990) ; however, several codons did allow significant though low level frameshifting (10/o-2%).

Since the genes overlap in an arrangement identical to that of the Tyl genes TYA and p/B, we suspected that expression of Ty3 POL3 required, like Tyl , a +l frameshift within the overlap region. Since the Ty3 overlap does not include the 7 nt Tyl frameshift site, CUU AGG C (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990) , the mechanism must necessarily be different. We show here that the Ty3 mechanism differs in several respects. That maximal Ty3 frameshifting required a longer 21 nt region indicated that the mechanism was probably more complex than that operating on the shorter Tyl site. Peptide sequencing identified the site of frameshifting at the beginning of the 21 nt required region, the sequence GCG Am u, which is decoded alanine (GCG)-valine (GUU). Unexpectedly, the shift in frames occurs at a codon GCG, decoded by a tRNA, tRNA&$, that cannot slip onto the overlapping +l frame codon, CGA. In other efficient programed frameshifts and translational hops, the site of the shift includes a site where a tRNA recognizes a cognate codon in the upstream frame but can also recognize a cognate or near cognate in the shifted frame (Gesteland et al., 1992) . The idea that the Ty3 event does not involve tRNA slippage is underscored by the observation that mutating GCG to GGG, which creates a potential site for slippage of tRNAEl5 from GGG to GGA, actually reduces frameshifting about 4-fold (see Figure 1) . A similar event occurs at the sequence GCC AAG C in E. coli. Lysine starvation causes +l frameshifting on this site, decoding it as Ala-Ser (GCC A AGC) (Peter et al., 1992; Weiss et al., 1988b) . This is a fortuitous, rather than programed, frameshift. The site induces very low levels of frameshift expression in the absence of starvation (-O.Ol%), rising to about 1 O/o frameshifting under severe starvation (Weiss et al., 1988b) .

The peptidyl-tRNA is indicated, with the nascent peptide indicated by a zigzag line. The Ty3 context is shown in italics. The model proposes that for the Ty3 site an intermolecular interaction with the context (and rRNA?) pushes the mRNA 1 nt in the 5' direction. tRNA&, which cannot slip, is forced 1 nt into the E site; the GUU codon in the A site is recognized by its cognate tRNA, causing the therefore function as a +l frameshift suppressor, by increasing the number of adjacent nucleotides accessible to the mRNA for pairing (Atkins et al., 1991; Bossi and Smith, 1984; Curran and Yarus, 1987) . Since it mUSt use normal tRNAs to achieve four base decoding, the Ty3 frameshift cannot depend on expansion of the anticodon loop in either tRNA&& or tRNAMJ. However, some +l frameshift suppressor tRNAs have 7 nt anticodon loops and can bind the mRNA with either a three or four base anticodon (Atkins et al., 1991) . Because of the threedimensional structure of the anticodon loop, when four bases pair with the mRNA they consist of the normal anticodon and its 3' neighbor (as shown in Figure 46 ). It is not possible to use an alternative expanded anticodon consisting of the normal anticodon and its 5'neighbor, the universal & base. tJ= interacts by a tertiary hydrogen bond with phosphate-38, which stabilizes the structure of the anticodon loop (Quigley and Rich, 1978) , so it cannot stack beneath nucleotide 34 of the anticodon to pair with the mRNA (Ayer and Yarus, 1988; Bossi and Smith, 1984; Curran and Yarus, 1987) . The same constraint probably operates on the tRNA responsible for Ty3 frameshifting; since the four base decoding of GCGA by tRNA&c would require that lJ% participate in the anticodon, this model is probably wrong. In fact, assuming this to be correct, four base decoding of GCGA by a 7 nt loop tRNA should result in insertion of Arg (CGA) rather than the observed Ala (GCG) (Figure 48 ). By contrast, four base decoding of AGUU would insertval (GUU), asobsewed, not Ser(AGU) (see Figure 48 ).

It is possible that the details of the codon-anticodon interaction would affect frameshift efficiency, that is, that its strength would affect the length of the translational pause.

In vitro biochemical analysis has demonstrated that synonymous codons can differ in rate of decoding and that that difference reflects the more rapid binding of a tRNA to one of the codons (Dix and Thompson, 1989; Thomas et al., 1988) . Rates of dissociation of synonomous tRNAs from the ribosome have no effect on rates of decoding, since they are very much less than the rate of peptide bond formation; essentially all cognate tRNAs selected by the ribosome remain bound and yield peptidyl-tRNA (Dix and Thompson, 1989) . However, the difference in decoding between synonymous cognate codons is very small; the differences between UUU and UUC and between CUU and CUC were no more than 2-fold (Thomas et al., 1988) . Since translation is a kinetically driven process, changes of as little as 2-fold can have a much larger effect on overall expression, so it is possible that such a small difference in decoding of If, however, an intrinsic difference in the kinetics of their decoding by tRNA?& does not explain why AGC cannot replace AGU as the pause codon, then the difference may depend on the overlapping +l frame codon.

Oligonucleotides having a Kpnl site prime toward the upstream HIS4 gene; they were used in PCR with an oligonucleotide, Sal-upstream (Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1996) , that primes from upstream of a unique Sall site at the 5' border of the HIS4 promoter.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 520, "end": 544, "text": "(Farabaugh et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 933, "end": 957, "text": "(Farabaugh et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1189, "text": "(Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1996)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 144, "text": "Figure I", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Experimental Procedures"}, {"text": "The sequence of each of the mutagenic primers is given in Table 2 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 58, "end": 65, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Experimental Procedures"}, {"text": "To test whether overproduction of the tRNA specific for the serine codon AGU would affect frameshift efficiency, we doned the tRNA& structural Qene by PCR.
