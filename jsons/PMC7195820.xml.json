Not only were neighbour countries infected, but it is now classed by WHO, a world-wide pandemic. Definite evidence has shown that the COVID-19 is mainly transmitted by person to person contact [1]. So far, more than 80,928 citizens have been infected, while 3245 have died in China by March 18, 2020. It was found that COVID-19 is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [2]. The Chinese government has taken measures such as delaying return to work and postponing school start dates to help prevent cluster cases which might lead to the disease diffusing quickly throughout the population. Chinese government has also ordered the isolation of large regions and cities. Currently, the fast spread of the infection coupled with its high lethality has caused a level of panic in the general public.",

Patients are able to upload their medical records, which can only be seen by the consulting doctor. It is a great comfort to patients with chronic diseases to access professional advice and get free assessment. There are also online lectures and articles about health education to help prevent any relapse in chronic mental patients. These resources guide citizens on how to relax at home, for example, they may use the knowledge gained from respiratory training and meditation. Aerobic exercise programs, for example, jogging, swimming, badminton, are recommended as they can help relieve adverse emotions. If conditions are restricted, leg raises, squats, push-ups, and abdominal exercises are also helpful.",

Chatting and communicating with family, friends, and co-workers through the use of phone or internet. To some individuals, pets can soothe emotions.
