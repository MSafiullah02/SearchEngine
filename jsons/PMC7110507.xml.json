Other species, such as the golden pheasant (Callonetta leucophyrs), make up only a tiny proportion of the pheasant population reared as game birds. Pheasants are predominantly reared in large numbers in parts of Europe for shooting as a sport on game bird \u2018estates\u2019. Although at one time rearing pheasants was labour intensive and involved the use of surrogate domestic hens in the hatching and rearing stages, the usual practice now is to obtain the eggs from pheasants retained from the previous year and these are hatched in hatcheries similar to those used for commercial domestic fowl. The birds are then reared semi-intensively until released through pens that allow the pheasants to move out gradually into the cover where they will live extensively and be driven from to be shot. There is considerable trade, both nationally and internationally in day-old and older chicks and, to a lesser extent, hatching eggs.",

This figure probably corresponds to numbers approaching 30 million pheasants being released, as Turner and Sage (2003) reported that only 30.5% of pheasants released were shot on the estate where they were released and only 16% survived the game bird shooting season. Earlier, Tapper (1999) had estimated annual figures of 20 million pheasants released and 8 million resident birds in the UK.",

They reported a high level of susceptibility in Phasianiformes (including gallinaceous birds), Psittaciformes, Struthioniformes and Columbiformes. This statement is well supported by the fact that these species have been affected in many recent outbreaks of NDV across the world (Alexander, 2001). All ages of pheasants are highly susceptible to ND, and infection with NDV often leads to death, which is preceded by a range of clinical signs (Higgins, 1982). In this article, it is intended to review the literature available describing infections in pheasants.",

In an outbreak of ND in young pheasants on a shooting estate in the UK in 2005, even in the worst affected pen the mortality did not exceed 3% (Aldous et al., 2007). However, in two experimental infection studies clinical signs developed into 100% mortality in unvaccinated birds (Lage et al., 1974, Muller et al., 1990). High morbidity and mortality of Japanese pheasants infected during enzootic outbreaks of NDV in Japan has also been reported (Ozai et al., 1987). However, in a study by Geral et al. (1976) experimental infection of pheasants and two types of partridges demonstrated an inconsistent relationship between virus dose and host mortality, with some individual birds demonstrating resistance to disease.",

The implications of this for internationally traded live birds was demonstrated when vaccinated pheasants imported into Italy and swabbed as part of a surveillance programme were found to be excreting the pigeon variant of virulent NDV (PPMV-1) in the absence of ND-related disease signs (Capua et al., 1994).",

Several publications in the 1940s discussed ND infections in the birds (Brandly et al., 1946, Levine et al., 1947, Wagener, 1948) and these probably represent the earliest recognition of the disease in pheasant. Beer (1976) reported that the first outbreak of ND in free-living pheasants in the UK was in 1963. In the earliest reports pheasants were often infected during epizootics in chickens and there was debate as to whether the pheasants introduced the disease to chickens or vice versa. What is clear is that when outbreaks of ND have been widespread in chickens, pheasants have also been affected. For example, during the extensive ND epidemic in poultry that began in Essex (UK) in 1970, isolations of NDV were made from submissions of pheasants over a seven-month period from birds showing clinical signs (Borland, 1972).",

NDV, infectious laryngotracheitis, avian poxvirus and infectious bronchitis virus have all been recorded in game birds as a result of direct or indirect contact with domestic birds or wild bird vectors (Lister, 1989). The role of wild birds in the spread of NDV in pheasants is illustrated by the outbreak in free-living pheasants in Denmark, where in the absence of any traceable contact with diseased poultry or other birds, it is suggested that the outbreak occurred due to virus introduced by infected feral migrating birds (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1999). In a further example, pigeons and doves infected with PPMV-1 were proposed as the likely sources of virus causing disease in nearby pheasants, since the viruses isolated from the two sources were quite distinctive and very closely related (Aldous et al., 2004, Alexander et al., 1997a).",

Considering the increasingly intensive nature of the pheasant industry, and the associated trade and movement of pheasants and their products, it would seem possible that diseased birds may be moved significant distances and have the potential to mix at holding stations before any infection with NDV could be detected.
