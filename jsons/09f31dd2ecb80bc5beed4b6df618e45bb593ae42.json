RDW quantifies the variation of individual red blood cell (RBC) volumes which vary from one cell to the next and for the same cell over as it circulates during its ~105-day lifespan. [5] [6] [7] Elevated RDW is associated with increased risk for a remarkably wide range of morbidity and mortality: all-cause mortality, mortality from heart disease, pulmonary disease, sepsis, influenza, and cancer; complications in heart failure, severity of coronary artery disease and viral hepatitis; advanced stage and grade for many cancers; development of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, anemia, and many more. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] RDW thus appears to represent a non-specific marker of illness with the potential to provide general quantitative prognostic value that may be particularly powerful for a new and unknown disease. RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the standard deviation divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume (MCV), an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Prior studies have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs. Because RBCs characteristically .

Cox proportional hazards modeling of mortality risk finds RDW associated with increased mortality risk after adjusting for age, absolute lymphocyte count, and D-Dimer. The top row shows results from models of mortality as a function of age, RDW, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer treated as continuous variables, in a multivariate model (top left) and each variable separately considered in a univariate model. Variables were normalized as follows: age to an increase of 10 years, RDW increase of 0.5%, D-Dimer increase of 100 mg/L, and a lymphocyte decrease of 0.1 103/ul. The bottom row shows results for models using discrete variables with the following thresholds: age > 70yrs, RDW> 14.5%, lymph < 0.8, and D-Dimer > 1500. These thresholds provide a similar fraction of abnormality in the cohort (33%, 29%, 27% and 28% respectively for age, RDW, lymph, D-Dimer). *Denotes hazard ratio was not significantly different from 1 (p > 0.05). .

While RDW elevation may reflect contributions from both a decrease in MCV and an increase in RBC volume variance, the large difference in mean RDW between the elevated and non-elevated groups (~3% in Figure 3A ) cannot be explain solely by the MCV difference of < 2 fL found in our cohort (see supplemental material). It is therefore likely that the major contributor to RDW elevation in this cohort is an increase in RBC volume variance. RDW is a non-specific marker of general illness [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and is therefore unlikely to be causally related to COVID-19 disease progression. COVID-19 is associated with altered turnover in all WBC lineages as noted above as well as with altered platelet dynamics in COVIDassociated coagulopathy. 19 The association of elevated RDW with COVID-19 severity could be consistent with prior reports suggesting that RDW can become elevated when RBC production kinetics have slowed in the setting of increased WBC and platelet kinetics. 6, 8, 18 .

RDW usually changes slowly because it reflects the volume variance of a cell population that is turning over at a rate typically no larger than a percent or two per day. Few patients in our cohort experience a > 2%/week increase in RDW during their admission, and the large increase in the elevated RDW group (> 3% on average in Figure 3A ) may suggest a longer duration of disease for these patients at the time of admission, but direct study of the earlier phases of the disease is required to know how quickly RDW may be evolving prior to hospitalization. Patients with many different underlying acute and chronic illnesses would be expected to have higher baseline RDW, and it is possible that RDW at admission is providing a non-specific summary marker of the presence of these illnesses that have been shown to be associated with elevated RDW and may also be expected to complicate COVID-19 clinical course. Independent of the reasons for the differences in RDW at admission, RDW's prognostic utility appears to persist after admission as demonstrated by the higher mortality for patients in our cohort whose RDW increased during admission.",
