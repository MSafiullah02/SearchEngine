Many attempts have been made for technological opportunity discovery (TOD) to identify technological opportunities and threats that could affect future growth and survival because they are considered some of the most crucial issues for companies (Cozzens et al., 2010). The studies on TOD have largely been conducted to anticipate promising technologies that have not yet been developed and to analyze potential new markets that can be created by utilizing existing technologies (Cho, Yoon, Coh, & Lee, 2016).",

The TOD studies based on patent analysis in the initial stage have focused on anticipating newly emerging technological opportunities. Recently, a few attempts have been made to identify technological opportunities via technological convergence (An, Kim, Mortara, & Lee, 2018).

Many quantitative approaches have been taken to tackle technology convergence using patent analysis. From the perspective of combining the research themes of TOD and technological convergence, the previous quantitative technological convergence studies have some limitations. First, most of the previous studies on technological convergence using patent analysis have analyzed patent data with a retrospective view by measuring the degree of convergence (Geum, Kim, Lee, & Kim, 2012; Takano, Mejia, & Kajikawa, 2016). However, it is necessary to identify technological opportunities for convergence in terms of technology planning for the future. This paper suggests a prospective TOD approach for technological convergence to overcome the limitation. Second, many convergence studies investigate industry- and macro-level technology fusion (Curran & Leker, 2011). It is insufficient to utilize the results at the stage of converging technology development because those studies analyze technological convergence at a high level. Third, from a methodological point of view, patent co-classification has been largely utilized to measure the degree of technological or industrial convergence in the previous convergence studies because patent classification is suitable to represent technologies as a proxy and to measure the overlap between technologies (Bongioanni, Daraio, & Ruocco, 2014). Although patent classification enables the monitoring status of convergence, it is difficult to suggest practical information in terms of a future-oriented perspective for converging technology development.",

Patent co-classification analysis has been utilized in most of the previous convergence studies, whereas patent citation analysis can be utilized because the citation information on patents or scientific papers has been considered a reliable proxy for TKF (Jaffe, Trajtenberg, & Henderson, 1993). In addition, to emphasize the future-oriented view based on the TKF approach, link prediction, which is a technique used to detect missing links in the current networks and to predict new links in future networks, is utilized to identify technological opportunities for convergence.",

Three research questions are suggested in the present study. First, what are the potential technological opportunities for convergence?

To solve the research questions, a new approach to exploring the TOD for technological convergence is proposed by means of link prediction in patent-citation networks and TKF networks, as well as by investigation of knowledge flow properties and technological knowledge themes. In addition, technological opportunities for convergence are discussed with the direction and strength of the predicted potential TKFs.",

Although TI focuses on opportunities and threats in the perspective of objects and is interested in information management and an analysis process in the view of activity, TOD concentrates on opportunities and the strategic use of information in terms of objects and activity. In this paper, we used the concept of TOD to identify technological opportunities because we deal with future-oriented opportunities and the strategic use of technological information.",

            "text": "In previous TOD studies using patentometric analysis, technological opportunities are proposed as the patent vacancy in the patent map, the outlier patent, and the recombination of technological functions. First, the vacant area was suggested as technological opportunities by developing the patent map based on textual information using data mining techniques such as the self-organizing feature map (SOFM) (Yoon et al., 2002), principle component analysis (PCA) (Lee, Yoon et al., 2009), and generative topology mapping (GTM) (Son, Suh, Jeon, & Park, 2012). The vacant area in the patent map was proposed as technological opportunities because it indicated the area that is not yet developed when the patent information is visualized as a map. Second, outlier patents that were distinctive from existing technology were proposed using the outlier detection technique (Geum et al., 2013; Lee, Kang et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2015), which can suggest more explicit potential technological opportunities by identifying a novel patent that is new and distinct from the existing technology rather than identifying a patent vacancy representing a set of keywords. Third, the recombination of technological functions was proposed as a technological opportunity by using keyword-based morphology analysis (Yoon & Park, 2005; Yoon, Park, & Coh, 2014) and the function-based TOD approach using the subject-action-object (SAO) structure (Yoon et al., 2015). This approach is based on the assumption that new knowledge or invention is the result of the recombination of the known components of knowledge (Aharonson & Schilling, 2016; Fleming, 2001; Funk & Owen-Smith, 2016; Notten, Mairesse, & Verspagen, 2017).",

The coverage of recent TOD studies tends to be extended by identifying technological opportunities from external areas. This paper concentrates on the new subject by meeting the recently required TOD research trend, in that it proposes a TOD approach for technological convergence on the basis of TKF from the future-oriented perspective.",

Research on the convergence of scientific disciplines has investigated the discovery of new knowledge through the exchange of knowledge. In this process, bibliometric analysis, such as co-word, co-citation, co-authorship, and journal subject category co-classification analysis, has been widely conducted using scientific article data (Leydesdorff, 2007; Porter & Rafols, 2009; Porter, Cohen, Roessner, & Perreault, 2007; Schummer, 2004; Sun, Ding, & Lin, 2016; Zhang, Zhang, Zhu, & Lu, 2017; Zitt, Ramanana-Rahary, & Bassecoulard, 2005). Research on market-level convergence has analyzed product specifications using press release data (Lee, Lee, & Cho, 2009; Han, Chung, & Sohn, 2009). In this research, we focused on technological and industrial convergence using patent data. Research on the convergence of technology at the industry level used patent data because patents are considered an indicator of technological innovation (Curran & Leker, 2011; Lee, 2007). In particular, the research on industry convergence analyzes industry-patent concordance information, such as standard industry classification (SIC) and international patent classification (IPC) concordance (Curran et al., 2010), to link technology information to industry information.",

From a patent indicator perspective, most of the studies developed patent indicators based on a patent classification system to measure the degree of convergence and to monitor the phenomenon of technological convergence. Trajectory patterns of technology fusion were identified by measuring fusion degree indicators based on the citing-cited relationship between patent classification codes (No & Park, 2010). A fusion index (FI), which represented the degree of fusion, was identified to predict promising fusion technologies (Lee & Yoo, 2014). Furthermore, indicators for identifying technological convergence were suggested based on the IPC-level network using the concept of entropy and gravity (Han & Sohn, 2016). From the patent-citation analysis perspective, a few studies measured technological convergence and monitored the trends of convergence from knowledge flow based on patent citation with patent classification. Geum et al. (2012) measured convergence intensity and coverage by means of patent citation and co-classification analysis. Ko, Yoon, and Seo (2014) analyzed the trends of industry-wide technology fusion by constructing a knowledge-flow matrix using the citation analysis between IPCs. Moreover, as a semantic analysis perspective, Moehrle and Passing (2016) suggested the possibility of convergence by applying an anchor-based patent mapping approach based on the semantic similarity. Most of the previous research on technological convergence has utilized patent classification because it is appropriate to represent the technological area and to measure the overlap between technologies.",

It is categorized into (1) node-based metrics, (2) topology-based metrics, (3) social-theory-based metrics, and (4) learning-based methods (Wang, Xu, Wu, & Zhou, 2015). Below is a summary of a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art link prediction in social networks by Wang et al. (2015). First, node-based link prediction metrics mainly calculate the similarities between node pairs by using attributes and actions that reflect node attributes and actions. Second, topology-based link prediction metrics are based on the topological information. Many topology-based metrics were proposed after Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg (2007) discussed several metrics based on structural graph features. The topology-based metrics can be divided into neighbor-, path-, and random-based metrics. Third, social theory-based metrics employ classical social theories, such as community, triadic closure, strong and weak ties, homophily, and structural balance. Finally, learning-based methods, as proposed in recent works, differ from the previous approaches by using link prediction metrics, internal attributes, and external information. These are divided into feature-based classification, probabilistic graph models, and matrix factorization. For more information on link prediction, several excellent survey papers used diverse perspectives (Liben-Nowell & Kleinberg, 2007; Wang et al., 2015).",

To this end, first, patent-level networks based on patent-citation relationships are generated by network analysis, which is widely used to comprehend knowledge flow. Two types of patent citation networks, patent citation networks, and potential patent citation networks are constructed. The patent citation network represents the current citation relationship, and the potential patent-citation network expresses the potential link between patents that do not have any citation relationship. The potential patent-citation network is generated by a link-prediction technique that predicts new links in future networks. In this paper, a link-prediction method based on edge-betweenness centrality is proposed to reflect the context of convergence and TKF between heterogeneous fields. Second, technology-level networks, TKF networks, and potential TKF networks are visualized by merging patents in the same technology group in the patent citation network. The types of change in TKF are identified based on the comparison of TKF networks and potential TKF networks. Third, a TKF property map is generated through the use of patent indicators that measure the property of TKF. The TKF property map represents the position of technology based on the property of knowledge flow and the direction of the predicted knowledge flow. Technological opportunities for convergence are identified by a comprehensive approach based on the types of change in TKF and the trends of the predicted TKF. Additionally, the themes of technological opportunities are suggested as a micro-level approach.",

The third step is to predict the potential patent citation. In this step, the proposed edge-betweenness centrality-based link-prediction method is used. Thus, the potential patent-citation network and potential TKF network are generated by merging information on patent-level citations and the results of link prediction, and then the type of change in TKF is identified.

Jawed, Kaya, and Alhajj (2015) also proposed a time frame-based link prediction using the triad pattern. The link-prediction approach using a triad pattern is not appropriate for patent-citation networks, in that a citation cannot occur mutually between patents. That is, the patent citation network is a directed network because of the acyclic characteristic of patent citation (a patent never cites later patents). Yu and Wang (2014) proposed a different approach for link prediction in directed networks by identifying three types of similar and candidate nodes for target nodes. In this research, the link-prediction technique suggested by Yu and Wang (2014) is adopted and revised to reflect the context of technological convergence opportunities.",

In this research, the proposed method is to predict potential links using edge-betweenness centrality, as suggested by Girvan and Newman (2002). The concept of edge-betweenness centrality is adopted from the vertex-betweenness centrality proposed by Freeman (1977). The vertex-betweenness centrality of node i, which is the number of shortest paths between pairs of other vertices that run through node i, measures the influence of a node over the flow of information between other nodes. The edge-betweenness centrality of an edge is defined as the number of shortest paths between pairs of vertices that run alongside it. The edge with a high betweenness centrality value can be interpreted as a bridge connecting different communities. Although Liu, Hu, Haddadi, and Tian (2013) proposed a link-prediction model based on node centrality, it gave weight based on the node centrality of common neighbors. The proposed link-prediction method gives weight based on edge-betweenness centrality because the links with a high edge-betweenness centrality value can be considered important links connecting heterogeneous fields in terms of TKF.",

The black solid line and gray dashed line in the potential TKF network in Fig. 5 denote emerging links and increased links in comparison with the TKF network. To conduct the proposed link prediction, cut-off values for bibliographic-coupling strength and edge-betweenness centrality should be selected. The distribution of the respective value on normalized bibliographic coupling strength and the edge-betweenness centrality for the method is shown in Appendixes A and B. The x-axis represents the intervals of continuous numerical value, the bar represents the rate of each interval, and the curve represents the cumulative rate as the y-axis. Both values follow long-tail distributions that have few very large events and many very small events. Most of the links have low normalized bibliographic-coupling strength values as shown in Appendix A because few sharing references exist between the patents in heterogeneous fields. Moreover, many zero values are found in the edge-betweenness centrality in the patent citation graph as shown in Appendix B. It is assumed that the distributions roughly follow the Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule), in that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Most of the normalized bibliographic coupling strengths had a low value because we searched for similar patents in different technological fields, and most of the edge-betweenness centrality had zero value in the patent citation network. We focused on the long tail in the distribution because the link prediction for converging TOD is intended to detect weak signals from the knowledge flow between heterogeneous fields. In other words, we chose the threshold value to catch weak signals by removing 80% of the general results. Thus, link prediction was conducted with the cut-off value for the normalized bibliographic-coupling strength as 0.262, which is in the top 20%, and for the edge-betweenness centrality as 360,000, which is also in the top 20%. The bibliographic-coupling value is calculated from the data assigned in heterogeneous technology sectors (i.e., the patents between BT and IT). The edge-betweenness centrality value was calculated for the patent-citation graph using the \u201cigraph\u201d package in R.",

To identify the technological opportunities in the respective potential TKFs, patents were grouped according to the Girvan-Newman clustering method (Girvan & Newman, 2002). The number of clusters was selected based on the results of modularity value, which is often used to detect an optimal number of clusters. The number of clusters in Appendix G was chosen when the network had a high modularity value through repeated calculations because networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within clusters but sparse connections between nodes in different clusters. After the clustering method was conducted, technological themes of the respective groups were proposed, as shown in Appendix G, by reviewing patents\u2019 titles and abstracts in groups.

In order to delete noise, we adopted 67 pairs among 136 TKFs, which account for approximately 95% in terms of patent citation distribution as shown in Appendix C. After performing link prediction with data between 2006 and 2012, 96 pairs are predicted. To validate the results, 250,162 patents registered between 2013 and 2015 were used as a future point data. In the data between 2013 and 2015, 109 TKFs appeared among 144 possible TKFs. Under the situation, we calculated precision and recall indices to validate the proposed method. First, the precision is the fraction of predicted pairs that are correctly predicted. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct results by the number of all predicted pairs. The 86 pairs in future point data occurred among the 96 predicted TKFs. Thus, the value of precision is 86/96 = 0.89. Second, the recall is the fraction of correctly predicted pairs to actual pairs that should be correctly predicted. It can be calculated by dividing the number of correct predicted results by the number of actual TKFs in future point. To calculate this, we took 57 pairs among 109 TKFs as the actual results in future point data by adopting the same cut-off rule selecting 95% pairs among all pairs in terms of patent citation distribution. The 55 pairs in future point data occurred among 96 predicted TKFs. Thus, the recall value is 55/57 = 0.96.",

We performed the correlation analysis using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient on the rate of knowledge flow that each pair has in the predicted and actual data. It was conducted from two perspectives, knowledge flow prediction and degree of convergence, because TKFs were predicted to detect the signals of technological convergence. Therefore, we investigated whether the knowledge flows and whether two technological fields derived from the predicted knowledge flows could converge in the future. More specifically, the first investigation determined whether the distribution of correctly predicted knowledge flows was similar to future distribution of actual knowledge flows. The second investigation determined whether the distribution of correctly predicted knowledge flows was similar to the future distribution of the degree of convergence. First, the rate of the correctly predicted 86 TKFs based on the patent data registered between 2006 and 2012 was compared to the rate of the correctly predicted 86 TKFs based on the patent data registered between 2013 and 2015 using correlation analysis. We suggested a correlation between predicted results of knowledge flows based on the data at the present point (2006\u20132012) and the future real knowledge flows (2013\u20132015). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.707. Second, the degree of convergence in the future real knowledge flows was measured by using co-classification analysis based on a 4-digit IPC, which represented a subclass, as co-classification analysis was widely used to calculate the degree of convergence. The rate of the correctly predicted 86 TKFs based on the patent data registered between 2006 and 2012 was compared to the degree of convergence in the correctly predicted 86 TKFs based on the patent data registered between 2013 and 2015 using correlation analysis. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.743. It has strong correlation in both perspectives when we measure Spearman\u2019s rho, which was calculated to reflect the difference between the present and future in terms of components of knowledge flow and the difference between the rate of knowledge flow and degree of convergence. Therefore, the technological opportunities for convergence can be discussed based on the results of proposed TKF prediction because the proposed link prediction power is high and the correctly predicted TKFs have roughly strong positive correlation with future point data.",

That is, no technologies took the definite absorptive- or diffusive-oriented roles in circumstances of TKF between BT and IT. Consequently, technological knowledge had been exchanged between BT and IT fields through equal reciprocal cooperation, and technological convergence between BT and IT has been in progress. These results are similar to those suggested by Hur (2017) showing that technological sectors coevolve with reciprocal knowledge exchange with each other. The properties of TKF between BT and IT could be divided into active, neutral, and passive properties, as suggested in Appendix E. The IT fields tended to actively absorb and diffuse technological knowledge compared to BT because three technologies (11(SIG), 13(ROB), and 17(SOL)) in IT fields were located only in TKF absorption and diffusion active groups (A&DA), but almost all technologies in the BT fields (except for two technologies, 5(SGY) and 2(BMD)) were located in the TKF absorption and diffusion passive group (A&DP). Although some technologies such as 2(BMD), 12(ELC), and 15(SOC) belonged to the TKF absorption and diffusion neutral group (A&DN) and 5(SGY) belonged to the TKF diffusion oriented group (DO), six BTs and four ITs were assigned to TKF A&DP in the current situation. One can interpret that some TKFs between BT and IT have been exchanged, but the TKFs rarely interacted with each other in over half of the technological areas. In the context of the convergence status quo, technological convergence has proceeded between BT and IT through reciprocal TKFs. However, several IT-relevant technologies tend to technologically converge more with some BT technologies because the TKF property (absorption or diffusion) represents the technologies that have already technologically converged between two fields in the status quo.",

Therefore, IT can play more of a leading role in terms of technological convergence between BT and IT because it provides technological tools and platforms for analysis to BT (Geum et al., 2012).

IT supports other technologies as an enabling technology. If the proposed approach applied to other technologies, they could have various characteristics. However, the proposed method can be generalized because it is a prediction methodology based on TKF in patent citation networks between various technological areas if knowledge flows occur between distinct technology fields. Fortunately, we could define technologies in BT and IT using predefined technological classification based on IPC and USPC. An issue of reliability may arise for the classification defining technology with combinations of patent classification. If this method was applied to other technology fields, defining technology using patents could be one of the tricky issues. IPC at a high level can be used as a proxy for technology if a proper way to define technologies is not found. Although an argument can be made for using IPC to represent technologies, patent classifications such as IPC and USPC are utilized as proxies for technology in some research because the IPC-classification system\u2019s granularity varies greatly between various technology areas.",

To choose the cut-off value in respective phase, first of all, data distribution should be observed. Then, the cut-off value should be selected by considering the objective of cut-off value with sensitive analysis. We mentioned three types of cutoff values in terms of link prediction, TKF network, and TKF property maps. First, the goal of using cutoff values in the link prediction is the detection of weak signals between two distinct heterogeneous technology fields. In our case, we used the Pareto rule and focused on the long tail in the distribution. We selected the threshold with top 20% to catch weak signals by removing 80% of general results in the distribution. The cutoff value in the link prediction process can be chosen with high values of bibliographic coupling and edge-betweenness centrality between two heterogeneous fields using sensitive analysis. This criterion can be utilized when applying this method between other distinct technology fields. It is expected that most of the bibliographic coupling strength and edge-betweenness centrality may have low value or zero value because this approach searches for similar patents between two distinct technological fields. Second, the cut-off value in the TKF network was selected to remove patent citation links, which can be considered noise because a technology-level network is merged with a patent network. In our case, we took 95.75% of patent citations and removed the rest based on the statistical significance level of 0.05 because the significant level indicates a 5% of risk of conclusion statistically. This cut-off value that selects a strategy using significance level can be applied to other cases, however, the distribution should be firstly checked and an analyst\u2019s review was also necessary with sensitive analysis because the distribution of patent citation between technology fields can be dependent on the technology fields. Finally, the cutoff point in the TKF property map was selected by dividing the inflow and outflow maximum values evenly to define the TKF property type in order to identify types of TKF property. It can be generally used when applying this method to other technological fields. When the proposed approach is applied to other cases, the cut-off value should be selected by considering the objective in each step. Qualitative approaches using sensitive analysis as well as quantitative criterion are necessary to determine a cut-off value because two types of cut-off value can be sensitively affected by the criterion.",

V1 is the weight strategy as a binary value that we are taking in this research, Vra strategy is the way weighting the similar nodes by applying the inverse of its out-degree, and Vsim strategy is the way weighting a candidate by measuring Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between a target node and similar nodes according to overlap of their out neighbors.

Appendix F shows the results of the first and second research questions, determining potential technological opportunities and their characteristics. In the context of potential types of technological convergence, the type of technological opportunity is suggested as incremental or radical technological opportunities for convergence. In terms of increased link prediction, half of the knowledge flows go from the A&DN group to the A&DP group; for the emerging link predictions, half of the knowledge flows go from the A&DP group to the A&DP group, and two knowledge flows go from the A&DA group to the A&DP group, as shown in Appendix F. The potential increased TKFs can be considered incremental technological opportunities for convergence because many TKFs already existed between BT and IT. Furthermore, many links were predicted to increase the existing TKFs. However, the potential emerging TKFs can be considered radical technological opportunities for convergence because the knowledge flows had not existed in the TKF network, and the TKFs that had passive properties in terms of knowledge flow between BT and IT accounted for half of all emerging TKFs. It can be interpreted that the potential TKFs that have both passive properties signify a more radical change than TKFs that have the active property because they are predicted to be technological opportunities for convergence although the property of technologies is presently passive. Moreover, bidirectional emerging TKFs tended to be more active than the unidirectional emerging TKFs because they included the A&DA, A&DN, and DO groups. Unidirectional emerging TKFs can be considered an incremental change among emerging TKFs. Therefore, the emerging TKFs as radical technological opportunities for convergence can be weak signals for technological convergence because all emerging TKFs had fewer predicted citation links than the increased TKFs, and the flows\u2019 properties tended to be more passive than the increased flows. The information on potential emerging TKFs can be riskier than the information on potential increased TKFs.",

Appendix G presents the list of potential technological themes as the results of the third research question by dividing them into two groups (incremental and radical opportunities). The TKFs for incremental technological opportunities were all predicted as bidirectional increased links. Only two bidirectional TKFs (11(SIG) \u2192 5(SGY) and 5(SGY) \u2192 11(SIG)) were included in the top 10 potential TKFs for incremental technological opportunities. The two technological flows have some difference in technological themes. The potential technological flow from signal processing (SIG) to surgery (SGY) showed knowledge flows (1) from touch detection to blood glucose level control, analysis of eating habits, and gastric stimulation; (2) from display for medical procedures to surgical navigation, brain stimulation, and neuron signal analysis; (3) from imaging an interior surface of a cavity to endoscopy and visualization systems; and (4) from x-ray images and methods for bone diseases to endoscopy and 3-D bone organic matrix density. However, the potential technological flow from surgery (SGY) to signal processing (SIG) showed knowledge flows (1) from data processing for use in tissue characterization to image processing and pattern recognition of images, (2) from cochlear implant sound processors to audio signal processing, (3) from surgical instruments to user interfaces and 3-D pointing devices, (4) from illustration methods to handheld devices as visual indicators and portable media devices, (5) from hearing aid appliances to optical waveguide vibration sensors and noise cancellation systems, (6) from biopsy devices to touch screens, and (7) from analytic sensors to video data recording. Although two TKFs are predicted as bidirectional increased knowledge flows and as incremental technological opportunities, their themes are rather different. The technological contents on SIG, which are mainly about image processing, flow to technological contents on SGY, which are related to surgical systems. In terms of the flows from SGY to SIG, not only image technological themes but also audio signal processing and biopsy-relevant technology flows to technological themes on user interfaces, such as 3-D pointers and touch screens. The potential emerging TKFs can also provide weak signals for radical convergence although the number of patents in the potential knowledge flows is small compared to those in the potential increased knowledge flows. Therefore, the directions of potential knowledge flows and technological themes can provide useful micro-level information when one builds a plan for technological convergence and conducts technology cooperation between heterogeneous fields. It can identify target technology fields for technological convergence, micro-level contents for technological convergence, and the role of knowledge diffuser or receiver on a cooperative R&D for convergence. For example, when one conducts technology cooperation for technological convergence between the technology fields of SIG and SGY, image processing techniques for medical procedures in SIG should be primarily used in collaboration with the techniques for surgical navigation and neuron signal analysis in SGY, and technology on hearing aid appliances in SGY should take the leadership with the noise cancellation system in SIG.",

First of all, TKFs between BT and IT were balanced based on patent data registered from 2006 to 2012 in terms of absorption and diffusion of knowledge flow without bias; consequently, technological convergence had already been in progress across many technologies in BT and IT. Therefore, many TKFs were predicted to increase, and some TKFs had recently emerged. Second, TKFs from BT to IT and from IT to BT were equally predicted in general. In terms of increased knowledge flow prediction, more knowledge flows occurred from BT to IT than from IT to BT, and more knowledge flows occurred from IT to BT than from BT to IT in terms of emerging knowledge flow prediction. Many TKFs moved from IT to BT when we extracted the top 10 potential TKFs as technological opportunities for convergence. Therefore, TKFs from IT to BT were mainly predicted because IT was a knowledge diffuser in knowledge flow between them although several knowledge flows that had already proceeded at a higher level than a certain standard moved from BT to IT.
