In addition, one-tenth to one-third (according to the locality) of the clinics send fecal samples and clinical data to prefectural/municipal Public Health Institutes (PHIs) for laboratory diagnosis. There are \u223c70 PHIs belonging to local governments. About 20 of the PHIs test fecal samples from pediatric clinics for SRSV, and 40 test for rotavirus. These PHIs examine the feces for viruses by cell culture, ELISA, electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virus-positive results, together with individual patient data, are electronically reported to IDSC. Thus, IDSC collects reports of two kinds: summations of the number of gastroenteritis patients and individual reports on virus-positive cases.",

In addition, microbiology staffs at some PHIs have received training in SRSV detection techniques (i.e., electron microscopy and RT-PCR). Currently, 41 PHIs can detect SRSV in fecal specimens from gastroenteritis outbreaks. As a consequence, the number of outbreaks of unknown cause were greatly decreased after the 1997 amendment to the Food Sanitation Law (figure 4). The winter SRSV outbreaks occurred simultaneously with pediatric cases of SRSV gastroenteritis, but the peak infection times did not exactly correspond with each other (for more details, see figure 8). (As of 11 March 1999, the reported numbers in the 1998/1999 season were small because of a delay in reporting laboratory diagnoses; if all of the reports had been in, the number would have been higher.)",
