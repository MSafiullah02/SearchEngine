The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) selected the adjective 'post-truth' as its word of the year in 2016, offering this definition: \"Relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" Fake news is the principal manifestation of the post-truth phenomenon. The Cambridge Dictionary defines 'fake news' as \"false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke\"; a similar definition of the term in the Collins Dictionary (which declared 'fake news' its word of the year for 2017) holds that it is \"false, often sensational, information disseminated under the guise of news reporting.\" The committee of the Australian Macquarie Dictionary, which chose fake news as its 2016 word of the year, described it as \"one of the big issues of the year around the world,\" capturing \"an interesting evolution in the creation of deceptive content as a way of herding people in a specific direction.\"",

The possibility of lying and influencing others with false information, exploiting their emotions and personal beliefs, is as old as communication itself because it is inherent in human nature. Gregory Bateson noted that animals communicate with a simplicity and innocence that humans have lost, noting that \"man's behavior is corrupted by deceit-even self-deceit-by purpose, and by selfconsciousness\" (Bateson 1972, p. 137) . The ability to lie is connected to mankind's superior cognitive capacity and presupposes a high level of awareness and reflection. These factors render human communication much richer and more versatile than animal communication, but at the same time more opaque, ambiguous, and subject to abuse and deception.",

Homer's epics, pillars of the other cradle of Western society, Greece, describe the deception by which the Achaean army, inspired by Ulysses, breaches the walls of Troy (Odyssey: VIII, 500-520); today, the expression 'Trojan horse' has found its way into the language generally as anything that attempts to deceptively subvert from within; one specific use of the expression in the area of computer technology refers to a type of malware that hides its destructive purposes within an apparently useful or innocuous programme.",

            "text": "It should therefore not be surprising that every era has been rife with fake news. One example is the forged Donation of Constantine, an apocryphal medieval text used to legitimize the temporal power of the church, which was exposed as a fake only many centuries later by the humanist Lorenzo Valla after he discovered historical and linguistic inconsistencies within the document. Others include the campaign of disparagement aimed at the French Queen Marie Antoinette, which doomed her historical reputation and sealed her tragic fate (Darnton 2017) ; the exaggerated Ems Dispatch, used by Bismarck to trigger the Franco-Prussian War in 1870; and the documents ingeniously forged by officers of the French general staff to support the accusations of treason levelled against the Alsatian Jewish captain Alfred Dreyfus, which, even after their counterfeit origin was revealed, were cited by the far-right intellectual Charles Maurras as a patriotic forgery (Margalit 2017) . Some pieces of fake news have identifiable and acknowledged authors, while others are spread through less public means that make them difficult to ascribe to a verifiable source, as was the case with the 'Great Fear' that spread through several rural areas of France in the summer of 1789 as the result of unchecked rumours of an aristocratic conspiracy, an imminent foreign invasion, and brigand raids killing farmers and destroying crops. These rumours induced the peasants to arm themselves and rise up against the aristocracy (Lefebvre 1932) . In other cases, the invisible hand behind the diffusion of fake news has been unmasked only after many years, as happened in the early 1990s when Russian intelligence executive Yevgeny Primakov conceded that KGB instigated the myth that HIV had been created in a laboratory on the orders of the US government (Riva 2018) .",

At the same time, for economic and political reasons, these tools became increasingly concentrated in the hands of the state or of massive political and corporate organizations. As early as the 1940s, the sociologist Karl Mannheim described the outline of the problem: on the one hand, mass media had been an essential factor in the \"fundamental democratization of society,\" while on the other it created exceptionally dangerous concentrations of power with the potential to influence and control populations, a potential that was then being tragically realized by totalitarian regimes (Mannheim 1940) .",

From a macro-social standpoint, individualization has created a progressively more atomistic society. This process has gained momentum over the last two centuries, and its present-day fruit can be seen in the fact that it has transformed everyone's personal, and even intimate, life. In his book Risk Society, the sociologist Ulrich Beck observes that \"the basic figure of fully developed modernity is the single person\" (Beck 1992, p. 122) . Accordingly, society is now \"the fully mobile society of singles\" (ibid.). Beck argues that this society of singles is the direction towards which we are all moving and that this course is irreversible.

The negation of social ties that takes effect in the logic of the market begins in its most advanced stage to dissolve the prerequisites for lasting companionship. (ibid., p. 123) Pressed by the market, the requirements of family, marriage, parenthood, and partnership are ignored. Just as the traditional form of the heterosexual family, based on role distinctions between men and women and aimed at the socialization of children-the family Talcott Parsons referred to in the 1950s (Parsons and Bales 1955 )-corresponded to the needs of the industrial and urban society of the mid-twentieth century, the society of singles corresponds to the changed needs of our present-day job market. Nowadays \"the labor market demands mobility without regard to personal circumstances\" (Beck 1992, p. 116) . Especially with the prevalence of telematics and mobile media devices, the current market requires that workers be constantly available, and therefore free from demanding social relationships like those of the traditional family. Beck notes that the final outcome of this process may be a welcome increase in the protection of individual human rights but fears that it will also involve a closing of \"the circle of individualization\" in which \"the designs of independence become the prison bars of loneliness\" (ibid., p. 123). The process of individualization has been accompanied by the new models of human relationship favoured by the internet. Wellman, one of the most important scholars writing about the sociology of social media and the web, has called the basic principle of this new communicative situation \"individualized networking\" or \"networked individualism\" (Wellman 2001 (Wellman , 2002 Rainie and Wellman 2012) .",

The self of our society is a \"minimal self,\" focused only on himself/herself (Lasch 1984) . The work of reasoning, making decisions, and planning and executing social change is now performed by enormous organizations and administrative bodies, with individuals becoming less and less central and influential. This can be identified as the process of bureaucratization. Some of the most important scholars of mass society during the 1950s and the 1960s, like Karl Mannheim, Charles Wright Mills, and Robert Nisbet, observed that changes in the structure of the society towards larger dimensions and greater complexity have inevitably issued in more and more bureaucratization, whose formal and inhuman rationality has progressively come to prevail in modern society. The ability of mere individuals to understand the social world has decreased because they do not have the tools to comprehend what is happening around them or the meaning of events and their consequences, let alone the possibility of directing or influencing those events. Facing a technological system that exceeds his/ her possibilities of comprehension and action, the human being shows what he/she is: a small being, weak and poor if singularly taken, since many entities can do more and better than he/she does (Donati 2009, p. 117) . This transfer of rationality and power from individuals to organizations is strongly fuelled by digital systems and platforms, and it is not by chance that people now think of these systems and platforms, operated by the \"custodians of the internet\" (Gillespie 2018) , as the most powerful entities operating in present-day societies. The big enterprises and administrative bodies, namely the big bureaucracies, have made use of a powerful tool of formal rationality-algorithms-whose inhuman, hidden rationality can decide the fate of enterprises, people, and financial arrangements without having to explain or be accountable to anyone.",

            "text": "The third important structural process operating in contemporary societies is globalization. From an economic standpoint, globalization means the intertwining of world economies and international markets, resulting in the rapid movement of products, capital, and jobs. Enterprises take on worldwide scope without regard for regional and national borders. From a legal and political point of view, the most significant aspect of globalization is the peripheralization of the nation-state, that is, the simultaneous rapid growth of supranational institutions and the waning power and control of the nation-state over economic and financial affairs. Another effect of globalization is the growth in the geographical extension, interconnection, and speed of information and communications technologies. Manuel Castells identifies globalization as \"the rise of the network society,\" characterized by the binomial of connected versus not connected (Castells 1996) . This new binomial redefines the meaning of the concepts of identity, belonging, inclusion, sovereignty, and citizenship. The increasing interdependence among global systems implies a dark side involving previously unimagined threats: environmental disasters with a global impact like the Chernobyl accident and the British Petroleum oil spill off the US coast in 2010; the rapid, global spread of diseases like SARS, avian influenza, mad cow disease, and COVID-19; and the growth of illegal networks engaged in drug dealing, money laundering, the weapons trade, and international terrorism. Osterhammel and Petersson have observed that globalization is not an autonomously operating process or an unstoppable historical phenomenon because macroscopic events are always the result of individual and collective activity-the work of globalization involves many different actors with diverse visions and strategies (Osterhammel and Petersson 2009, p. 151) . Sometimes, these actions have unintended global side effects. \"We must remember that much of what appears in retrospect to have been the logical consequence of a world growing smaller was also due to unintended side effects of behavior that definitely has no global aims\" (ibid., p. 152). However much that may be the case, globalization is felt by individuals to be a fated and often hostile process led by powers beyond their control, including the impersonal laws of the market, Wall Street tycoons, bureaucrats in Brussels and Washington D.C., Hollywood corporations, and the masters of the internet. The fact that globalization sweeps away identities, local economic systems, traditions, lifestyles, and social relationships has caused widespread bewilderment.",

This chapter is intended to offer a multidisciplinary picture of the soil in which the tree of post-truth took root, which in our view has not yet been provided by the numerous essays and commentaries analysing the OED's decision to highlight the term.",

Note 1. The term 'post-truth' was first used by scholars and journalists in the 1990s (Tesich 1992; Keyes 2004 ), but it would be years before it would become an established term in either the journalistic or popular lexicon. The expression 'fake news' can be traced back in print to the end of the nineteenth century and perhaps earlier (cf. Merriam-Webster, The Real Story of 'Fake News,' https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-real-story-offake-news).",
