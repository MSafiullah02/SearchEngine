In both cases, analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the oligomeric state of the construct used. For example, the NMR construct was a trimer in the presence of 30% TFE and the X-ray construct was a tetramer under aqueous conditions.13,14",

            "text": "There could be several explanations for the disparity in the NMR and X-ray structures. First, the NMR structure was determined in the presence of TFE, a co-solvent used to stabilize helical structures17 and thus the oligomerization state and relative orientation of the helices could be induced by the co-solvent. However, analytical ultracentrifugation studies of the NMR construct under aqueous conditions (i.e., in the absence of TFE) suggested that HR2 was in equilibrium between monomeric and trimeric forms.15 Second, the determination of a protein complex, the HR2 trimer, by NMR is relatively demanding because it is based on a small number of intermolecular NOEs that could possibly be misinterpreted. Finally, the NMR construct that we used contained an 11 residue extension at the N-terminus (9 native residues and 2 residues from a cloning artifact), which may affect the orientation and oligomerization state of HR2. Clearly, it is important to resolve the orientation and oligomerization states of HR2 for a better understanding of SARS-CoV envelope-mediated viral entry and the mechanism of HR2-based inhibitory peptides. In this work, we added a nitroxide spin label to the N-terminal region of HR2 and used paramagnetic relaxation enhancement to assess the orientation of the HR2 helices under different solution conditions.",

To determine whether HR2 is organized in a parallel or anti-parallel manner, we mutated residue S14, which is found in the N-terminal region of HR2, to cysteine. Subsequently, we attached the nitroxide spin label MTSL to the newly introduced cysteine to form S14C-MTSL. This has the effect of introducing a paramagnetic center to this region of the protein, which has previously been shown to result in increased line-widths of resonances within 25 \u00c5 of the spin label.18,19 If the HR2 complex is in a parallel orientation, as determined by NMR, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement would be observed for resonances at the N-terminal region (i.e., those close in sequence to residue 14). On the other hand, if the HR2 complex is in an anti-parallel orientation, as determined by X-ray crystallography, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement would be observed for resonances at the C-terminal region, as well as the N-terminal region.",

Based on C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distances, the residues most affected are <15 \u00c5 from the spin label site. Importantly, a similar effect is observed under aqueous conditions, which strongly supports the parallel orientation of SARS-CoV HR2. The differences between the NMR and X-ray structures may therefore be attributed to differences in the constructs. For example, the NMR construct contains nine additional native residues at the N-terminus with respect to the X-ray construct and it would seem that the additional residues push the equilibrium to the trimer of parallel helices. The propensity of heptad repeat regions to self-associate in different orientations and oligomerization states indicates that caution should be exercised in the interpretation of isolated domains. On the other hand, the ability of HR2 to assume different structures may have functional ramifications for the entry mechanism.13,15,16,20",

Previously, we have shown by CD, NMR, and analytical ultracentrifugation that HR2 exhibits a monomer\u2013trimer equilibrium and that the monomer is unstructured.15,16,20 As a consequence, the intermediate effects shown in Figure 2(b) may be attributed to the approach of distant residues to the spin label attached to residue 14. To test the validity of this notion, we determined a family of HR2 structures without using experimentally determined NOE, H-bond, and dihedral restraints. A family of 20 monomer structures is shown in Figure 2(d). In this figure, the site of the spin label is depicted by a sphere of 15 \u00c5, the approximate radius of correlations that are completely abolished in the 15N-edited HSQC spectra. The respective locations of the N- and C-terminal residues are depicted by cyan and red spheres, respectively. From this figure it is clear that the C-terminal residues that exhibit intermediate relaxation effects may often approach the local region of the spin label. For example, from a family of 100 HR2 structures the range of C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distances observed for residues 20, 30, 40, and 50 to residue 14 is 8\u201320, 16\u201351, 15\u201368, and 11\u201380 \u00c5, respectively. Based on the molecular dynamics simulations, it is predicted that the closest approach of residues 30, 40, and 50 is similar and thus the relatively uniform effects on relaxation may not be surprising. Finally, we note that we have previously suggested that the flexibility of the unstructured state facilitates conformational changes that are necessary for envelope-mediated membrane fusion.15,16,20",

The mutated version of HR2, termed S14C, was subcloned into the BamH1/HindIII restriction sites of a modified pQE30-expression vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The resulting construct consists of an N-terminal polyhistidine tag, followed by PG (the IgG binding domain of streptococcus protein G),21 a TEV (tobacco etch virus) cleavage site for removal of the expression tag, and S14C. 15N-labeled S14C was prepared as previously described.14,15 Briefly, protein expression was achieved by growing E. coli strain SG13009 in the presence of the appropriate plasmid in 1 L of LB media supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL of kanamycin at 37\u00b0C until they reached an OD600 of 0.8. The cells were then pelleted, washed once with M9 salts, re-suspended in 250 mL of M9 minimal media supplemented with 1 g/L 15NH4Cl (Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD), and set to recover in the absence of antibiotic selection. Protein expression was induced after 1 h by the addition of 0.8 mM IPTG and grown for an additional 4\u20135 h at 37\u00b0C. The HIS-PG-S14C fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction using a Ni2+ fast-flow Sepharose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The protein was then cleaved using TEV protease and run once more over the Ni2+ column to remove His-PG and TEV protease, which also contains a polyhistidine tag, as well as uncut HIS-PG-S14C. The flow-through fraction containing S14C was then dialyzed extensively against 10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM3, Amicon, Billerica, MA). The purity and identity of S14C was confirmed using SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The newly introduced disulfide bond was reduced using a 5\u00d7 molar excess of DTT. Excess reductant was removed using a Micro-Bio Spin chromotography column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), then the reduced protein was incubated with a 7\u00d7 molar excess of MTSL (S-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl) methyl methanesulfonothioate) overnight at room temperature in 10 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% sodium azide, to form S14C-MTSL. Finally, unbound MTSL was removed by dialysis against buffer containing 10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0.",
