However, this invasive procedure is potentially painful for patients, and there is concern that the performance of this procedure in a young infant may have lasting emotional effects if appropriate analgesia is not utilized.1 Evidence suggests that neonates exhibit responses to their perception of painful stimuli that are both reproducible and enduring and that they may be more sensitive to noxious stimuli than older children.1 Repetitive noxious stimuli experienced in the early stages of development have been associated with impacts later in life including behavioral and emotional difficulties during childhood, the tendency toward major psychosis, intractable pain syndromes, and altered responses to pain.2\u20134 A prospective study in France in 2008 demonstrated that the majority of young infants undergoing painful procedures did not receive analgesia before or during procedures.5 Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of pain control during all LP procedures in infants to minimize both physical and emotional distress.6",

Analgesic options commonly used in the ED during this period as indicated by our provider and nursing survey included topical lidocaine (TL) (LMX4: Eloquest Healthcare; Ferndale, Mich.), oral sucrose solution (Sweet-Ease: Philips Healthcare; Cambridge, Mass.), J-tip lidocaine (1% buffered lidocaine prepared by pharmacy and administered via J-tip Needle-Free Jet Injector: Medline Industries; Northfield, Ill.), locally injected 1% lidocaine, and fentanyl (delivered intranasally via a MAD Nasal intranasal mucosal atomization device: Teleflex Medical; Morrisville, N.C.).

Before this intervention, the use of TL during the LP procedure may have been hindered by considerations of timeliness, given that this product takes 20\u201330 minutes to take a full analgesic effect. However, through centering our intervention in the triage stage of the visit, we created a streamlined care process, thus increasing analgesic utilization. Our postintervention survey supports this finding and indicates the value and perceived efficacy of TL, along with demonstrating that a significant portion of TL was applied during the triage process. Furthermore, we established that this intervention did not produce a negative effect on the use of more traditional methods such as injectable lidocaine, thus furthering our project aim of utilizing multiple analgesics during the procedure. Due to the limitations of retrospective chart review, we were unable to establish the number of patients who received TL during the triage process but did not undergo an LP procedure, limiting our assessment of this as a balancing measure for this intervention.",

Our interventions increased awareness and discussion of the project. Through this, we were able to reach 100% compliance with the use of at least 1 form of analgesia and demonstrate a significant increase in the use of 2 forms, meeting project goals. We attribute this success to the multiple forms of communication utilized, including electronic messages, infographics in work-spaces, and individual educational opportunities, allowing us to reach staff members in various ways. The creation of a collaborative effort limited the single provider burden and ensured both the efficacy and the sustainability of the interventions.

Finally, our retrospective data collection did not allow us to obtain objective measures of infant discomfort or family satisfaction, nor to ascertain whether parents remained present in the room, a possible source of additional comfort. Although these findings would be helpful in a comprehensive assessment of pain associated with infant lumbar puncture, they were not necessary for the demonstration of our primary outcome, an increase in the provision of recognized pain control methods.
