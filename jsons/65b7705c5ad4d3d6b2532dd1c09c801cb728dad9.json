Residents from two other homeless shelters (B and C) used shelter A's day center services. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was offered to available residents and staff members at the three shelters during March 30-April 1, 2020. Among the 181 persons tested, 19 (10.5%) had positive test results (15 residents and four staff members). On April 1, PHSKC and CDC collaborated to conduct site assessments and symptom screening, isolate ill residents and staff members, reinforce infection prevention and control practices, provide face masks, and advise on sheltering-in-place. Repeat testing was offered April 7-8 to all residents and staff members who were not tested initially or who had negative test results. Among the 118 persons tested in the second round of testing, 18 (15.3%) had positive test results (16 residents and two staff members). In addition to the 31 residents and six staff members identified through testing at the shelters, two additional cases in residents were identified during separate symptom screening events, and four were identified after two residents and two staff members independently sought health care. In total, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 35 of 195 (18%) residents and eight of 38 (21%) staff members who received testing at the shelter or were evaluated elsewhere. COVID-19 can spread quickly in homeless shelters; rapid interventions including testing and isolation to identify cases and minimize transmission are necessary. CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident's heads are at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1).",

On March 30, PHSKC was notified that a resident of homeless shelter A had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure) . The resident, a man aged 67 years with underlying medical conditions, was hospitalized on March 29 for acute encephalopathy. He reported 2 days of cough, shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. A nasopharyngeal swab collected on admission was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing. The patient remained clinically stable without the need for intensive care unit support and was discharged after 5 days to isolation housing (i.e., an individual room with clinical support) provided by the King County Department of Community and Human Services.",

To reduce crowding and COVID-19 transmission risk, approximately half of the residents of shelter B had been transferred to shelter C on March 13. Sleeping mats and locations in shelters B and C were assigned to individual residents and remained in place all day. Shelters B and C became 24-hour shelters on March 13 and 26, respectively. All shelters had onsite indoor bathrooms with sinks and soap. All shelters served persons aged \u226550 years and were located approximately 2-5 miles (3-8 kilometers) from each other.

For all shelters, the rapid response teams provided recommendations to limit staff member rotations, encourage physical distancing, limit movement in and out of the shelter, train staff members on cleaning and disinfection, and move sleeping mats so that residents' heads are \u22656 feet (\u22652 meters) apart.

Additional measures included limiting movement into and out of the shelter (e.g., by providing on-site showers), encouraging physical distancing, and making infection prevention and control recommendations.

            "text": "The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, not all residents were present during the site visits; thus, residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection could have been missed during the testing events or symptom screening. Multiple testing and screening events were conducted to assess as many residents as possible. Second, these public health interventions were resource-intensive, which might not be sustainable long term. Third, symptom screening and testing were conducted independently of each other, which did not allow for simple linkage of symptom and test result information. Finally, the effectiveness of the interventions could not be assessed during the period of the investigation and response. Homeless service sites are densely populated environments, similar to long-term care facilities, which can amplify infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 (4). Common methods to control COVID-19 spread (e.g., testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, and restricting movement) are difficult to implement among persons who are experiencing homelessness (5, 6) , and stay-at-home orders are impractical. CDC has published interim guidance for homeless service providers to plan and respond to COVID-19. CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident's heads are at least 6 feet apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1). Assistance with enforcement of shelter-in-place orders might be necessary for persons experiencing homelessness during spread of COVID-19. At shelters experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, transferring infected residents and those with underlying health conditions or of advanced age (7, 8) into individual housing units should be prioritized.",
