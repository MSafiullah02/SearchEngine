            "text": "On 31st December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the first case of COVID-19 in Wuhan China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). In early and mid-January 2020, the virus started to spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by a huge movement of people towards their hometowns to celebrate Chinese New Year which turned the outbreak into a national crisis. Although Wuhan officials announced a complete travel ban in terms of its residents on January 23, the virus still spread quickly. The WHO declared a global emergency due to the rapidly spreading of COVID-19 on January 30, 2020. It\u2019s only the sixth time that such type of global emergency has been announced, with past examples including that of the Democratic Republic of Congo Ebola outbreak and the Zika virus. Chinese scientists linked this disease to a virus family known as coronaviruses, which includes both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). According to the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 symptoms may occur within as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure or contact with an already affected person, which makes it even harder to confirm and control during early stages. By assessing the risk of spread and severity of COVID-19 outside China WHO declared this virus as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The fatality rate of COVID-19 as compare to other known viruses is quite low, but its infection rate is relatively high (Table 1). As of March 23, China, Italy, and the United States have most of the number of confirmed cases of COVID 19,81601, 59,138, and 31,573 respectively (WHO situation report\u201363, Figure 1). According to CDC and many other researchers at the moment, the source of COVID-19 is unknown and there is no specific vaccine and treatment [1,2,3]. ",

            "text": "The WHO and public health officials performed the role of mediator to communicate the risk of an outbreak to the investors and it shapes the investors\u2019 sentiments towards the disease [4]. Investor\u2019s sentiments influence the stock markets significantly. When the market is trending upwards and there is less perceived risk then investor behaves more optimistically. When the market is trending downwards then investors\u2019 sentiments become relatively pessimistic and investors will tend to wait to enter the market until a revival begins [5,6]. Such situations lead to short term investor overreaction. Shu [7] studied how mood affects financial market behavior. The study shows how the fluctuations in investor mood directly affect prices for equilibrium assets and projected returns. Researchers suggest that media coverage also affects the actions of investors, the higher the number of articles relating to unexpected events, the greater the number of withdrawals [8,9,10]. Globalization has linked economies worldwide and increased the interdependence of global financial markets in recent years. This increased interdependence among the global stock markets may have an impact on global investors\u2019 decisions on asset allocation and on economies as well as economic policies to ensure economic stability [11]. By using a vector auto regression model, In, Kim, and Yoon [12] examined the dynamic linkages and interactions between the Asian stock markets and their results showed that the markets became more closely linked during the financial crisis, except Malaysia. For any global financial market analyst, it is obvious that stock markets continue to move in the same direction in different countries. There are some variations, however, in the sense that some stock markets appear more correlated with each other than others [13]. Although globalization brings many significant economic advantages, it also plays an important role during infectious global crises [14]. The planet has recently been hit by increasing numbers of infectious diseases such as Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus, MERS CoV, SARS, Lassa fever, Nipah Virus, avian flu, Rift Valley fever, Zika virus. The spread of contagious disease not only affects people\u2019s health and lives but also induces a decline in economic growth. ",

There are major challenges of COVID-19 to personal lives, including lockdowns (or lockdown-like situations) for a large number of people. Besides the extreme occurrences of death and disease, many people across the globe are panicking because of this fast-spreading infectious disease. Such external and unexpected shocks can bring down economic trends and suddenly change investor\u2019s sentiments. Kaplanski and Levy [15] suggest that investment decisions can be affected by bad mood and anxiety and that anxious individuals may be more pessimistic about future returns and therefore tend to take fewer risks. Anxiety creates a negative feeling which can impact investment decisions and the subsequent returns on assets.",

Siu and Wong [16] studied the spread of Hong Kong\u2019s SARS epidemic, and addressed its economic impact and suggested that the most serious negative impacts were seen on the consumer side, with the short term severely affected by local consumption and the export of tourism and air travel-related services. The economy did not face any supply shock, as the manufacturing base present in the Delta of the Pearl River was unaffected and products were usually exported to Hong Kong. By using the G-Cubed (Asia Pacific) model Lee and McKibbin [14] evaluated the global economic impacts of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and according to them the effect of the SARS epidemic on human society all over the world is severe, not only because the disease spreads rapidly through countries by global travel, but also because of financial integration and globalization, any economic shock to one country spreads rapidly to others. Ichev and Marin\u010d [17] investigated whether the geographical proximity of information disseminated by the 2014 Ebola outbreak, coupled with widespread media coverage, has affected US asset prices. The results show that the effect on stock prices is generally negative, while local media reporting also has a significant impact on local trading, and the effect is more pronounced in smaller and more volatile stocks and less stable industries.",

Nippani and Washer [19] examined the effect of SARS on Canada, China, the particular administrative region of Hong Kong, Indonesia, China, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand and concluded that SARS only affected the stock markets of China and Vietnam. Del and Paltrinieri [9] evaluated the 78 mutual equity funds geographically based in African countries with observed monthly flows and results for the 2006\u20132015 period and suggested that Ebola and the Arab Spring seriously affect the funds flows, controlling the performance of the funds, spending, and returns of the market. Macciocchi et al., [20] studied the short-term economic impact of the Zika virus outbreak on Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and their results showed that, with the exception of Brazil, the market indices of these three Latin American and Caribbean Countries (LCR) did not show large negative returns the day after each shock. The average return was \u22120.90 percent but on different occasions and countries it ranged from 0.90 percent to \u22124.87 percent. Ming-Hsiang Chen, Shawn, and Gon [21] checked the SARS outbreak impacts on the efficiency of Taiwanese hotel stocks using an event study approach and found that during the SARS outbreak period, seven publicly traded hotel companies experienced steep declines in income and stock price. Taiwanese hotel stocks showed significant negative cumulative mean abnormal returns on and after the day of the SARS outbreak, indicating a significant impact of the SARS outbreak on performance in hotel stock. Mei-ping Chenet al., [22] analyzed the effect of the SARS epidemic on China\u2019s long-term relationship with four Asian stock markets their findings support the existence of a time-varying co-integration relationship in aggregate stock price indices, and they also found that the SARS epidemic has weakened China\u2019s long-term relationship with the four markets. Wang, Yang, and Chen [23] suggested that infectious disease outbreaks have a major impact on the performance of biotechnology stock in Taiwan. According to Bai [24] Baker, Wurgler, and Yuan [25] investors may feel pessimistic about investment prospects in a given market, selling off that market\u2019s stocks under communicable disease outbreak.",

Sun and Hou [27] found that in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand were most financially integrated with China. According to Morales and Callaghan [28] the global stock markets were becoming more interdependent and crisis in one country would soon spread to another. Stock market movements become increasingly correlated. Events like infectious disease outbreaks can induce negative changes in investors\u2019 sentiment that strongly affects their investment decisions and, consequently, stock market prices. In countries that are culturally more susceptible to herd-like actions and overreaction or countries with low institutional participation, the effect of investor sentiment on stock markets is more pronounced [29,30].

According to several COVID-19 news sources, in late December 2019 a new disease outbreak was recorded in Wuhan. Later, on Dec. 31, the virus was first identified to the WHO. But it was not until 20 January, 2020, when the National Health and Fitness Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China high-level expert group leader Zhong Nanshan proposed in an interview that the new coronavirus could be transmitted among people, that the disease attracted wide public attention. Right after the interview, the infectious coronavirus began to appear in the press over the world, which grabbed the headlines of the major media. Thus, 20 January, 2020, when the news broke out causing a stir, is selected as the event day. To study the influence in different periods, we set up five event windows consisting of 35 trading days after the event day: (0, 6), (7, 13), (14, 20), (21, 27), (28, 34). Referring to related researches [23,38], we define the estimated window of 90 trading days before the event day when studying the influence of infectious diseases on the market behavior. As there is a lot of uncertainty in the stock market, too long a window period may not be accurate. To test the sensitivity of our results, we also use (\u20121,\u2013120), (\u20131,\u2013150) and (\u20131,\u2013180) as the estimated windows to compute the abnormal returns. We use the T-test to test the significance of the results and change the event window and estimated window to strengthen the robustness. Moreover, results from event windows of different lengths reflect the various response speeds and changing trends of the stock market. The expected returns are derived using the market model, and the ordinary least square (OLS) based on the following regression model:(1)Ri,t=\u03b1i+\u03b2iRmt+\u03b5i,t",

To begin, we used OLS to analyze the country-level stock market indices in response to the virus outbreak while controlling for global and country-specific characteristics embedded in stock indices, including country and year fixed effects. In our main tests, we analyze how the confirmed cases of COVID-19 affects the abnormal return of major markets stock indices. Then we set the dummy variable Asia to group the market indices to see the regional effect of the virus outbreak as it could be spreading faster or getting more attention in Asian areas at the beginning of the outbreak in our study period. If the index belongs to the country in Asia, Asia equals to 1, otherwise, Asia equals to 0. The following is the baseline model of our regression:(7)ARit=\u03b1+\u03b21Log_caseit+\u03b22Returnit+\u03b23ReturnMit+\u03b3i+\u03b4t+\u03b5it",

We report robust standard errors to deal with the heterogeneity problems that is always a concern with economic data. The results in Table 12 show a significant negative relationship between confirmed COVID cases and stock market indices daily abnormal returns after the outbreak. Asia gets a negative sign which indicates indices in Asian areas as a whole suffered more in their performances compared with those which are out of the region. These results also echo our earlier analysis using the event method. As a robustness check of our ordinary least squares (OLS) regression we used feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimation with heteroscedastic error terms including time dummies.

To safeguard the staff, factories and offices are shutting or reducing activities which decreases labor force, productivity, and ultimately affects the profitability of companies. It would leave several businesses illiquid and, if not handled correctly by officials, would cause companies to resort to staff cutbacks or to shut down entirely.
