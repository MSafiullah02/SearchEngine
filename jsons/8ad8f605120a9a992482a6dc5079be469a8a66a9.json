The classical RAS as it looked in the middle 1970s consisted of circulating renin, acting on angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which in turn was converted into angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II, still considered the main effector of RAS was believed to act only as a circulating hormone via angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. Since then, an expanded view of RAS has gradually emerged. Local tissue RAS systems have been identified in most organs. Recently, evidence for an intracellular RAS has been reported. The new expanded view of RAS therefore covers both endocrine, paracrine and intracrine functions. Other peptides of RAS",

However, the physiological implications of the RAS have continued to expand (Fig. 2) and we have not seen the entire picture yet. It has gradually become evident that in addition to the 'circulating RAS,' there is a local 'tissue RAS' in most organs and tissues studied. In fact, even intracellular generation of Ang II has been reported [4]. This makes RAS not only an endocrine, but also a paracrine and an intracrine system. Moreover, both the heptaptide angiotensin 2-8 (Ang III) and the hexapeptide 3-8 (Ang IV) have been shown to be biologically active. The angiotensin 1-7 heptapeptide (Ang 1-7) appears to play an important role by counterbalancing many actions of Ang II. Angiotensin II and Ang III actions are mediated by AT1 and AT2 receptors only. Recent discoveries have revealed specific functional receptors for Ang IV, Ang 1-7, and perhaps most surprisingly, even for renin \u2044 prorenin. Therefore, our present expanded view of RAS (Fig. 2) is quite complex and multilayered.",

Saline extracts of rabbit kidney were shown to slowly raise the blood pressure (BP) when injected into rabbits. The principle causing this was present in kidney cortex but not in medulla and was destroyed by heating. The authors concluded that the substance was a protein and they named it renin. They speculated that 'renin might in some direct or indirect way be associated with hypertrophy of the heart found in renal disease and high BP'. However, these early results could not be repeated in other laboratories, and it was not until late 1930s when renin was 'rediscovered'.",

In the early 1970s, the major components of 'classical' circulating RAS (Fig. 1) were identified and there was compelling evidence to indicate important roles for RAS in the regulation of fluid balance and BP. At that time, however, there was widespread skepticism Review | regarding the role of RAS in cardiovascular disease. It was not until the discovery of orally effective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the first of which was captopril [2] , that the paramount importance of RAS in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease was being appreciated. The introduction of losartan, the first orally active and effective angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker [3] further strengthened this concept.

Numerous experiments suggest an important interaction between Ang (1-7) and prostaglandin-bradykinin-NO systems. Ang (1-7) appears to counterbalance several actions of Ang II.

Two receptors have been characterized; the M6P \u2044 insulin-like growth factor II receptor, a clearance receptor and the specific renin receptor, which activates intracellular signalling and enhances receptor-bound renin catalytic activity on the cell surface (Fig. 4) . Renin receptors are abundant in heart, brain and placenta, lower levels being found in kidney and liver [52] . Visceral adipose tissue also expresses renin receptor, whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue expressed less renin receptors [53] . It appears that renin receptors participate in local production of Ang II and may contribute to systemic Ang II levels as well. Binding of prorenin to the renin receptor (Fig. 4) leads to activation of prorenin to active renin, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p44 \u2044 42 and TGF-b, ultimately increasing contractility, hypertrophy and fibrosis [51, 52] .

In these experiments, a plasmid construct under the control of an a-myosin promoter caused increased intracellular Ang II and 68% increase in relative heart weight. The mechanisms by which intracellular Ang II exerts its actions are not fully understood. Thus, intracellularly applied ARBs can only partly block intracellular Ang II.

ACE2 is believed to normally counteract these harmful effects, but following attachment of SARS virus to ACE2 and replication, ACE2 expression is diminished, less Ang 1-7 is formed from Ang II and AT1 receptor activation is intensified. In support of this contention, injection of recombinant ACE2 into mice protected these mice from acute lung injury caused by sepsis or acid aspiration [69] .

            "text": "Combined blockade of the RAS by ACE inhibitors and ARBs has been shown to provide additional benefits compared with either drug class [92] [93] [94] . However, these expectations were not confirmed by the recently published ONTARGET study [95] which compared treatment with telmisartan, ramipril or both drugs combined in a megatrial comprising 25620 patients with high cardiovascular risk profile. Of particular interest is the use in ONTARGET of telmisartan, by far, the most prominent activator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-c, a mediator of a host of favourable metabolic actions [33, 96] . In the ONTARGET study, mean BP was lower in both the telmisartan group (0.9 \u2044 0.6 mm Hg greater reduction) and the combination therapy group (2.4 \u2044 1.4 mm Hg greater reduction) than in the ramipril group. Telmisartan was equivalent to ramipril in terms of primary outcomes in patients with vascular disease or diabetes. The combination of telmisartan and ramipril was associated with more adverse events (hypotension, renal dysfunction) without an increase in benefit. The recent introduction of the first orally effective renin inhibitor, aliskiren, has raised additional interest in new possibilities of almost complete blockade of RAS as a tool (Fig. 5) , perhaps, more effective than earlier, in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [92, 93, 97, 98] . Early reports on the use of aliskiren are promising, showing at least, an antihypertensive effect of aliskiren potent as those of other antihypertensive drugs [93] . In particular, the combination of renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and ARBs may offer a solution to the 'renin escape' phenomenon [93] , which implies that ACE inhibitors or ARBs may lose part of their effect during long time treatment. Many questions are also raised, for instance, what would the consequences be if the 'beneficial' angiotensin peptide, Ang 1-7 was not generated at all or 'benefical' AT2 receptor mediated effects disappeared completely? Only well conducted experiments and trials may answer such questions. We may look forward to interesting years ahead whilst waiting for results and answers.",

It appears quite unlikely that we have seen the whole picture yet. This challenging complexity and the central position of RAS in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease will continue to inspire research and drug trials aiming at creating optimal pharmacological tools for RAS modulation or blockade.",
