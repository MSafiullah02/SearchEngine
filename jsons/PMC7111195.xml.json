The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses Spaulding's criteria to determine the potential for transmission of infectious agents. In this classification, items contacting the vascular system or sterile tissues pose the greatest risk of infection and are classified as critical.1 Using sterile items when contacting the vascular system or sterile tissues minimizes the risk of infection.2Aseptic technique should be used when preparing medications. Breaks in aseptic technique have contaminated IV anesthetic agents and medications, resulting in clusters of infections.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Good practices include\n\u2022performing hand hygiene before preparing medications,\u2022cleaning vial stoppers before puncturing them,\u2022using multiple needles to withdraw medication into multiple syringes,\u2022not transferring syringes of unused medication between patients, and\u2022not storing syringes of propofol at room temperature for the day.\nMedications should be stored in a clean area. Personnel should perform basic hand hygiene according to the CDC's \u201cGuideline for hand hygiene in health-care settings,\u201d10 before preparing medication. Vial stoppers should be cleaned with alcohol before they are punctured. Single-dose vials should be used for only one patient. Syringes of unused medication should be discarded at the end of the procedure. Propofol should be withdrawn immediately before administration.3Aseptic technique should be used when administering medications. Bacteria from hands can contaminate syringes and their contents.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Multidose vials have been found to be contaminated.17 Syringe contents have been found to contain blood or bloodborne pathogens after one injection or entry into IV tubing.13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Using a common syringe in the IV tubing ports of more than one patient has transmitted infectious diseases.9, 24 Syringes and needles should be used for only one application (eg, one syringe and one needle per entry into a multidose vial). Intravenous tubing ports should be cleaned with alcohol before they are punctured with a needle.\n",

The CDC has determined that their potential for transmitting infectious agents is significant and has classified these items as semicritical.1\n2Reusable semicritical items should be cleaned as the first step in reprocessing. Removal of organic material provides optimal conditions for proper exposure of equipment to disinfectants and sterilants.1, 25, 26 Rigid laryngoscopes should be disassembled and all components cleaned, including handles. Some automated pasteurization equipment has a cleaning step within the pasteurizing cycle.3Clean, semicritical reusable items should be processed by high-level disinfection, pasteurization, or sterilization with a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent, according to AORN's \u201cRecommended practices for high-level disinfection\u201d or \u201cRecommended practices for sterilization in the practice setting.\u201d27, 28 Written instructions from the manufacturers of reprocessing equipment, chemicals, and instruments should be followed. High-level disinfection kills vegetative bacteria, tubercle bacilli, some spores, fungi, and viruses.1 The CDC recommends that reusable semicritical items be high-level disinfected, pasteurized, or sterilized to minimize the risk of transmission of infectious agents.1 This recommendation is supported by professional organizations, including the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc (APIC), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA).1, 29, 30 Inadequately disinfected laryngoscope blades have been implicated in clusters of infections.31, 32, 33 Laryngoscopes should be disassembled and all parts thoroughly cleaned and the blades high-level disinfected before they are reassembled. Some LMAs are designed for limited reuse. Manufacturers' instructions should be followed.4Flexible endoscopes should be processed according to AORN's \u201cRecommended practices for cleaning and processing endoscopes and endoscope accessories,\u201d34 and the manufacturer's written instructions. Infections have been transmitted when flexible endoscopes have been reprocessed in an automated endoscope reprocessor with the biopsy port caps off or adapters that were incompatible with the equipment.35, 36 Users of this equipment should verify compatibility of the reprocessor with the endoscope and that adapters are approved by the manufacturer of the reprocessing equipment for use with the particular endoscope being processed. Manufacturers' written instructions should be followed.5Residual chemicals should be removed and the reprocessed item thoroughly dried before storage or use on a patient. Residual chemicals on items have led to allergic reactions and tissue burns.37 Chemical stains have occurred when ortho-phthalaldehyde was not rinsed off adequately before use.38 Users of chemical disinfectants should verify the appropriateness of the chemical's use on items being disinfected and thoroughly rinse the items according to the manufacturer's written instructions. These recommendations may include a triple rinse. Disinfected items should be dried thoroughly and stored in manner that prevents recontamination or damage. Use of contaminated tap water to rinse semicritical items has resulted in transmission of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.39, 40, 41, 42, 43 This agent proliferates in the channels of endoscopes.39, 40, 43 Items should be rinsed with sterile water after the chemical disinfection process. If sterile water is not used, the item should be rinsed first with water and then with 70% alcohol, and it should be thoroughly dried, along with its lumens and channels.43\n6Disinfected semicritical items should be stored in a clean location in a manner that prevents recontamination or damage. Storing semicritical items in a clean location minimizes the risk of contamination with pathogens before use. Endoscopes should be stored vertically with control valves, caps, and hoods removed.43\n7Personnel should be trained in the reprocessing procedures and equipment. Training personnel regarding the complexities of the equipment, chemicals, and processes used minimizes the risk of human error.8Quality control of reprocessing procedures should be performed and documentation maintained in accordance with\n\u2022AORN's \u201cRecommended practices for high-level disinfection,\u201d27\n\u2022AORN's \u201cRecommended practices for sterilization in the practice setting,\u201d28 and\u2022manufacturers' written instructions.\nQuality control measures provide assurance that mechanical and chemical conditions are optimal for high-level disinfection. Documentation provides a mechanism for process improvement and investigation of adverse events.\n",

Cleaning removes organic and inorganic material, which allows the disinfectant to contact all surfaces.1, 25, 26\n3Reusable laryngoscope handles should be cleaned and low-level disinfected between patients. Laryngoscope handles become contaminated during airway management. In studies, 40% to 50% of handles tested positive for blood.44, 45 Cleaning and disinfecting these handles minimizes the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens. The disinfectant selected should be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use as a hospital disinfectant and used according to the manufacturer's written instructions.46\n4Reusable noncritical items should be low-level disinfected between patients. Low-level disinfection with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant kills most bacteria and some viruses and fungi but may not kill tubercle bacilli or bacterial spores.1 After subjection to low-level disinfection, the device is considered safe to come in contact with intact skin.5Surfaces of anesthesia equipment that are touched by personnel while they are providing patient care or handling contaminated items should be cleaned and low-level disinfected between use on patients, according to manufacturers' written instructions. Surfaces of anesthesia equipment become contaminated with oral secretions and blood during surgical procedures.47, 48, 49, 50 Researchers have found occult or visible blood on 29.5% to 35.5% of anesthesia machines, carts, and monitors.47, 48 Blood also has been found on ventilator controls, flow meter knobs, vapor controls, ECG leads, oximeter probes, and blood pressure cuffs (ie, 25% to 64.3%).48 Surfaces of anesthesia carts, drawer handles, touch screens, flow meter knobs, ventilator controls, ECG leads, oximeter probes, and blood pressure cuffs should be cleaned and disinfected between use on patients. Other surfaces known to have been touched during patient care also should be cleaned and disinfected between patients.6Exterior surfaces of anesthesia equipment (eg, anesthesia cart, machine, monitors) that are not knowingly contaminated during patient care should be terminally low-level disinfected at the end of the day according to manufacturers' written instructions. Contact with blood and body fluids is routinely associated with tasks performed by anesthesia care providers.50 These surfaces may become contaminated during use, without the knowledge of the provider.51 Low-level disinfection with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant renders the surfaces safe to contact intact skin.1 Manufacturers recommend specific agents to clean complex electronic equipment. These instructions should be followed.\n",

These manuals help in developing operational, safety, and maintenance guidelines. Recommendations vary by manufacturer and equipment model. Manuals should be maintained for each.2Anesthesia equipment should be assigned an identification number. Identification numbers allow for documentation of inspections, safety checks, preventive maintenance, repairs, and tracking in the event of a patient or equipment problem.3Before placing anesthesia equipment into service, the safety features of the equipment should be tested by qualified, trained personnel, according to manufacturers' written instructions. These tests should be specific to the type and model of equipment involved and include, but not be limited to, calibrations and alarms. Testing the equipment before initial use minimizes the risk of patient injury resulting from faulty equipment.4Before use, anesthesia equipment should be tested according to manufacturers' written instructions and the safety standards of the facility. This check provides assurance that basic safety features of the equipment are operational. The FDA's \u201cAnesthesia apparatus checkout recommendations\u201d can be adapted for this purpose.53\n5Routine maintenance of anesthesia machines should be conducted on a regular schedule by qualified, trained personnel, according to manufacturers' written instructions. Regular preventive maintenance minimizes the risk of mechanical failure of anesthesia equipment.6Any equipment not meeting safety standards should be removed from service. Equipment failing safety checks poses a risk to patients and/or personnel. Removal of the equipment minimizes these risks. The ASA has published guidelines for determining when anesthesia machines should be considered obsolete.54 Obsolete machines and equipment should be replaced.7Before use on a patient susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH), the anesthesia machine should be prepared in a manner that minimizes trace anesthetic agents. Halogenated anesthetic agents may trigger MH in susceptible patients.55 Removing traces of these agents minimizes this risk. The Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States recommends changing the soda lime and breathing circuit, draining and inactivating vaporizers, and flushing the machine with 10 L of air or oxygen for 10 minutes before using the machine for an MH-susceptible patient.56\n8Equipment containing mercury should be replaced with alternatives that are mercury-free. Mercury poses a risk to patients and personnel as well as the environment. Removing mercury from the health care environment minimizes these risks.57\n\n",

Particular attention should be given to the valves. An appropriate and cost-effective schedule for reprocessing has not been established.58 Single-use absorbers are available and should be used for only one patient. Routine sterilization or high-level disinfection of the internal components of anesthesia machines is unnecessary.29, 30, 58\n2Anesthesia ventilator bellows should be cleaned regularly according to manufacturers' written instructions.3Soda lime should be changed according to the manufacturer's written instructions. Soda lime canisters do not filter bacteria adequately.59, 60, 61 In one study, 40% of bacteria passed through the soda lime.61 The bactericidal activity of soda lime also is unreliable.61, 62\nMycobacterium tuberculosis has been found to survive three hours in soda lime.61 Soda lime, therefore, should not be used as the only method of filtration. Canisters and contents should be replaced according to the manufacturer's written instructions.4Routine use of single-use breathing circuits with bacterial filters should be considered. Bacteria circulate through the anesthesia circuit and proliferate inside the absorber and accessories.63, 64, 65 Filters prevent microorganisms from contaminating the ventilator and escaping into the OR through the positive pressure relief valve of the waste gas scavenging system.62, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 Research findings indicate that the absence of bacterial filters does not lead to an increased rate of nosocomial pneumonias.58, 74 In one investigation, however, contamination of the anesthetic circuit was identified as the likely cause of transmission of hepatitis C virus.75 Currently, there is no consensus about the routine use of bacterial filters.29, 30, 58, 76, 77 For patients with known or suspected tuberculosis, the CDC, ASA, and AANA recommend using a bacterial filter between the patient and breathing circuit.29, 30, 58 The Canadian Society of Anesthesiologists also recommends use of bacterial filters for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).78 With the increased prevalence of tuberculosis, increased numbers of immunocompromised patients, and the advent of SARS, it is prudent to consider the routine use of bacterial filters on the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the anesthesia circuit. Some single-use circuits have a heat and moisture exchanger equipped with these filters. Reusable circuits should be cleaned and undergo high-level disinfection, pasteurization, or sterilization between use on patients.5Humidifiers should be used and cleaned according to manufacturers' written instructions. The water in humidifiers is heated to temperatures that reduce or eliminate microbial growth.79 Tap water may contain stationary-phase forms of Legionella pneumophila, which are heat resistant.66 Sterile water should be used in humidifiers.58, 79, 80, 81 Reusable humidifying chambers should undergo sterilization or high-level disinfection between patient uses.58, 79 Single-use chambers should be discarded after use on one patient.\n",

Immediate disposal of sharps prevents injuries to people unaware of the location of the sharp and is required by OSHA.82\n2All personnel involved with cleaning and processing anesthesia equipment should practice according to AORN's \u201cRecommended practices for standard and transmission-based precautions.\u201d85 These precautions define general measures for infection control.3Anesthesia equipment should be processed using methods that reduce the risk of exposure to pathogens and injury. Manual cleaning methods that minimize splashing, spraying, spattering, and generation of droplets protect personnel from exposure to blood, body fluids, and cleaning agents.4Personnel must be apprised of the hazards in the workplace, including chemicals used for reprocessing anesthesia equipment. Knowledge of the hazards in the workplace, preventive measures, and exposure management minimize the risk of injury to employees and are required by OSHA.86\n5Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be provided to minimize the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens and chemicals used in the workplace. Use of barrier protection minimizes the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens by personnel performing tasks likely to generate contact with blood. According to OSHA regulations, employers are required to provide PPE (eg, gloves, gown, mask, protective eyewear, face shield) for their employees.82\n6Personnel should actively participate in the evaluation of engineering devices and work practice controls to minimize the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Active participation in the selection of PPE and practices provides the best opportunity for designing a safer workplace. According to OSHA regulations, employers are required to solicit nonmanagerial employee input during evaluation of engineering devices and work practice controls to minimize exposures to bloodborne pathogens.87\n\n",
