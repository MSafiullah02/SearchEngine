The nature of the biotechnology problem-indeed the nature of the biological research enterprise-is vastly different from that of theoretical and applied nuclear physics in the late 1930s. Evolving biotechnology presents an inextricably linked combination of opportunity and danger and that distinction turns on projected consequences and attributed intentions at the level of fundamental research. Matthew Meselson gave a stark warning of the potential dangers posed by the destructive applications of biotechnology at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2000.",

For example, an Australian research group attempted to sterilize mice by immunizing them against an important reproductive protein (discussed in detail in Subheading 3.3.). To do so, this protein was inserted into the poxvirus genome to produce the antigen in the mice. A gene for interleukin (IL)-4 was also inserted into this poxvirus vector, because IL-4 is known to enhance antibody formation. Although the original intent was simply to sterilize the mice, the researchers found that the engineered poxvirus construct was more virulent. The construct resulted in the death of genetically resistant, vaccineprotected, and wildtype mice. This example illustrates the current potential, through biotechnology, to enhance the potency of disease-causing agents.",

History has demonstrated that research in biology conducted without any military application in mind may still contribute to the production of biological weapons. In this context, the next generation of biological warfare (BW) agents may mimic physiologically active compounds and disregulate fundamental life processes including reproduction, apoptosis, cognition, and enhancement or suppression of the immune response.

With the birth of recombinant DNA technology in the early 1970s, the possibility that new agents might be constructed for offensive purposes became a reality. Military planners in the BDRP program office began to seriously consider this possibility in the early to middle 1990s. Their concerns were borne out with the defection of one of the leaders in the former Soviet Union offensive bioweapons programs. Ken Alibeck described a significant project within this program specifically aimed at the use of recombinant technologies to modify classic agents as well as develop new agents with unique pathogenic properties. This program was referred to as \"bonfire\" in his book about covert former Soviet Union bioweapons development (3) . The bonfire project attempted to make relatively simple (by today's standards) modifications of agents such as the incorporation of antibiotic resistance genes in classic bacterial agents. Russian bioweaponeers were also purported to have modified classic agents such as Yersinia pestis such that they produced dramatically different pathologies compared with the unaltered pathogen. Interestingly, some hints of these activities were published in the open literature although many have not been independently confirmed.",

Possible examples of both of these potential agents will be discussed later.

It should be pointed out that the definitions of these two groups may, in some cases, be arbitrary because classic agents may produce new or mixed pathologies after modification.

            "text": "In 1997, the DOD medical community was alerted to just how serious a threat genetic modification was to their planned anthrax vaccination program for military personnel. A small group of Russian scientists at the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology in Oblensk published a paper in the journal Vaccine, which demonstrated that the addition of a single gene to a strain of Bacillus anthracis could cause disease in vaccinated animals (21) . This research center was one that Alibeck had mentioned in his book as specializing in constructing recombinant threat agents (3) . These researchers added a cereolysin gene from Bacillus cereus to a fully virulent B. anthracis strain. The cereolysin AB genes encode a functional hemolysin. Hamsters immunized with live B. anthracis harboring only pOX1 encoding the anthrax toxin and not pOX2 encoding the capsule displayed an immune index of 140 when challenged with the unmodified (cereolysin negative) recombinant. In contrast, hamsters immunized with the same strain and challenged with the recombinant cereolysin-producing strain were not protected (immune index approx 1). Thus, mice could be well-protected by live immunization with a crippled strain of B. anthracis but were not protected when challenged with the cereolysin producing recombinant organism. This \"vaccine breakthrough\" could be overcome if the cereolysin gene was included in the live B. anthracis vaccine strain used to immunize the animals. These results brought into question the utility of vaccination of the entire military population and weather simple genetic modification might circumvent that program. It should be noted that these results have not been independently confirmed at this time.",

            "text": "The classic bacterial biothreat agents are generally susceptible to most antibiotics used to treat the infections (5, 9, 11, 24, 26) . However, multidrug resistance has been reported for Y. pestis but is confined to the island of Madagascar (13, 15) . Doxycycline is one of the primary antibiotics recommended for treatment of infections caused most of the high-risk bacterial threat agents (US Army Medical Research Institute if Infectious Diseases Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook, http:// www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebook.html). The Russian offensive program is purported to have invested in the generation of recombinant organisms that were resistant to the common therapies such as antibiotic treatment (3). This is consistent with the desire to produce offensive biological weapons for which there was no current cure (3) . The idea that they were producing antibiotic-resistant BW agents is supported by several publications in the open literature. Gorelov et al. generated a multidrug resistant vaccine strain of Brucella abortus (14) . This strain was resistant to doxycycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, and rifampicin. The drug-resistant strain was generated by spontaneous selection for rifampicin resistance and by transformation with a \"hybrid\" plasmid. The researchers went on to demonstrate that the vaccine strain retained the ability to immunize animals against brucellosis. This latter point was important because recombinant strains of pathogenic organisms can be altered in terms of biological properties in some instances. In relation to recombinant antibiotic resistant B. anthracis, Pomerantsev and Staritsyn (22) studied the stability of a tetracycline resistance plasmid pCET in vegetative cells and in spores. These studies included conditions for stable maintenance, complete loss and integration of the plasmid into the chromosome of B. anthracis. Experiments to test stability of the added phenotype would be necessary for the development of antibiotic resistant B. anthracis strains as a BW agent, which is consistent with Alibeck's assertion that the former Soviet Union offensive BW program developed strains of the organism that were resistant to five different antibiotics (3) . Generation of multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of Pseudomonas mallei (Burkholderia mallei) and P. pseudomallei (B. pseudomallei), which cause glanders and melioidosis, respectively, have also been described in the open literature (1,2,25) .",

The addition of specific genes could then result in the creation of a more virulent organism. This process can be thought of as the laboratory equivalent of what occurs in nature. The process from nonpathogen to pathogen is believed to be primarily driven by lateral gene transfer events (20) . The resulting pathogen depends on the traits that are added to the ancestral bacteria. The study of evolution of pathogens in this manner has been greatly supported and accelerated by genomic sequencing efforts and comparisons between completed genomes. One specific example of the close relationship between nonpathogenic and highly pathogenic members of a genus can be see in the comparison of Y. pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. These two organisms are highly related at the whole genome level yet cause vastly different diseases (8) . A detailed description of the differences between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis can be found in Chapter 22. The emergence of a new pathogenic organism is thought to be through \"genetic sampling\" such that new combinations of genetic materials coalesce and allow an organism to occupy a new niche in nature. Theoretically, this might be possible to duplicate in the laboratory using recombinant techniques and, therefore, must be considered in future preparations to counter bioterrorism and BW threats.

This was seen more than 20 yr ago when the agent of Legionnaire's disease could not be isolated. Of course the first step is the isolation of the agent but then soon follows the identification needed to help provide proper therapy for infected patients. The recent emergence of SARS is a good example of how rapid sequencing capability can provide useful information during an infectious disease epidemic. Two different groups were able to grow and isolate the virus from infected tissue culture cells at about the same time (10, 17) . These studies used electron microscopic examination, random polymerase chain reaction sequencing, and immunoreactivity to identify the agent as a coronavirus. Two weeks later, the complete genome sequence of the SARS virus was reported by two independent groups (18, 23) . Knowledge of the complete genome sequence allowed the exact identification of the virus as well as the determination of the phylogeny that gave rise to this new strain. The fact that SARS has a relatively small genome of approx 27 kb facilitated the rapid sequencing, assembly, and molecular characterization of this newly emerged virus. Of course, this would be more difficult with larger bacterial genomes that are megabases in size. However, complete sequence information may not be necessary to determine the identity of the organism involved in the outbreak at least sufficiently enough to allow proper treatment.",

Genome sequencing projects and use of databases of this type may be useful in the identification of low-virulence or nonpathogenic organisms that might be genetically modified (see Subheading 3.2.).

Accordingly, a genotype database capability is absolutely critical for monitoring and countering emerging threats. More information can be found about genotyping BW pathogens in Chapter 21.",

These researchers demonstrated that a modified mousepox virus, ectromelia (ECTV) could: a) cause lethal infections in normally genetically resistant mice; and b) cause lethal infections in mice previously immunized against infection with ECTV. The genetic modification included in this strain of ECTV was the inclusion of the gene encoding the normal cytokine IL-4 into the genome of the virus. These experiments were performed under the auspices of enhancing the immune response to other recombinant antigens carried on the virus. The creation of the supermousepox and the possibility that similar experiments could be done with smallpox had obvious implications on further development of an already formidable bioweapon. These implications were noted in prominent scientific journals and reignited discussions about the open nature of publication of scientific results and implications such publications have for national security",
