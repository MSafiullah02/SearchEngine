            "text": "Dr. R. Wheatland was used putting forward a hypothesis: \u201cMolecular Mimicry of ACTH in SARS \u2013 Implications for Corticosteroid Treatment and Prophylaxis\u201d that published in the journal \u201cMedical hypothesis\u201d [1]. Dr. R. Wheatland found that expression of amino acid sequences of SARS virus is molecular mimics of the host\u2019s adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). When the host produces antibodies against these viral antigens, these antibodies may also bind to the host\u2019s own ACTH, which limits the host\u2019s stress response by interfering with ACTH\u2019s ability to stimulate the secretion of corticosteroids, leading to the dysfunction of adrenal cortex. Therefore, the treatment with corticosteroid may correct the defect in SARS patients. Moreover, this molecular mimicry of ACTH and anti-ACTH autoantibodies were also found in patients with influenza infection [2].",

            "text": "This is a very interesting hypothesis to explain the reason why corticosteroid treatment is effective for SARS patients. However, this hypothesis has three obvious defects: First, anti-coronavirus antibody became detectable first at 5\u201310 days after the onset of symptoms, and their levels peaked at 20\u201330 days and then were sustained over 150 days according to the published data [3], therefore, the dysfunction of adrenal cortex in SARS patients should not exist at early stage of SARS and should be severe in 3 weeks after the infection. However, the hypothesis is not consistent with clinical situation. Second, if anti-coronavirus antibody is the reason leading to dysfunction of adrenal cortex, due to molecular mimicry between the coronavirus and ACTH, the vaccine of SARS should have the same complication. However, this situation was also not found by the clinical test of SARS vaccine in China. Third, we detected whether there was anti-ACTH antibody in serum of SARS patients. These sera were collected, respectively, from healthy donors, patients with SARS, patients with severe SARS and patient with SARS in convalescence [4]. Using an ELISA, we found that the serum levels of anti-ACTH antibody in the three SARS groups was comparable with that in the control group and has no statistic difference between these groups. Using an competition ELISA, we also found that incubation with serum of the three SARS groups with anti-ACTH antibody has no significant effect on the detection of anti-ACTH antibody, indicating no increasing anti-ACTH antibody in serum of SARS patients.",
