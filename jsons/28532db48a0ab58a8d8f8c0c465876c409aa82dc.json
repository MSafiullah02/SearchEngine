We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 -3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 -9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity.",

How Hong Kong successfully prevented a community outbreak through quarantine measures while 34 avoiding a city lockdown thus offers us a useful perspective on determining intervention strategies for other 35 countries/regions. 36 37 Community acquired infections in Hong Kong were first detected immediately after infected travellers entered 38 Hong Kong from mainland China at the beginning of the Lunar New Year festival, which lasts for 7 days from 24 39 January to January 30 in 2020, and transmitted the disease. During the festival, more than one million travellers 40 (including Hong Kong residents) arrived in Hong Kong from mainland China in a single week [20, 21] . As 41 in most other countries, border control and quarantine policies were implemented in order to stop the initial 42 spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan to Hong Kong. Up until 4 February 2020, when most of the border crossings 43 were closed, infected cases with a travel history from Wuhan or mainland China were reported almost daily and 44 community acquired infections were subsequently detected as well. [22] . Due to the increasing number of the 45 imported cases, starting on 28 January, travellers from mainland China meeting certain criteria were required to 46 undergo 14 days self-quarantine. Compulsory quarantine was applied to all travellers from mainland China from 47 8 February. Surprisingly, up until the end of February, the total number of confirmed cases remained quite low 48 without the exponential growth seen in many other countries, while public services such as public transportation 49 were still running and businesses, shops and restaurants remained open. Kong. First, the information on which proportion of COVID-19 infected cases were quarantined and the timing 56 of their quarantine start is generally not available, not only because these data may not be fully recorded but also 57 because the true size of the infected population is not known. Therefore, these quantities have to be estimated 58 using a modelling approach. However, due to the fact that many confirmed cases were imported cases from 59 the epidemic regions rather than all cases being acquired locally, simple traditional transmission models, such 60 as a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, were not sufficient to characterize the COVID-19 61 transmission dynamics properly in Hong Kong as these models treat all infections the same without considering 62 5 .

To obtain the reproduction number, an indicator of the transmissibility of the virus, the average 63 number of secondary infections of a given infected individual, needs to be estimated. If the proportion of im-64 ported cases is high, the changes in the total number of confirmed cases are not exclusively caused by those 65 secondary infections acquired locally. As a result, the reproduction number cannot be estimated accurately using 66 the simple SEIR model. Second, the number of imported cases can be greatly affected by the number of travellers 67 entering Hong Kong and by border control measures. The number of travellers from mainland China to Hong 68 Kong reduced substantially after most of the border crossings were closed on 4 February 2020 [22] . Hence, it is 69 necessary to incorporate the effects of border control measures affecting transportation from mainland China to 70",

The 211 time interval was used to represent the quarantine start time (relative to symptom onset) of an infected case. The 212 estimated T q was -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 -3.88) (Table 2, Figure 4A ), indicating that the low R e estimate was 213 achieved through quarantining infected cases about half a day before their symptom onset. However, if T q was 214 delayed by 1.43 days to 0.86 (95% CI, -2.78 -5.31) days, i.e., less than one day after symptom onset, R e became 215 greater than one, resulting in an increased risk of community spread.

Furthermore, 219 the ratio of the contact rates of quarantined to unquarantined patients q also affected the value of R e . The ratio q 220 was estimated at 10.26% (95%CI, 5.32 \u2212 17.80). If q changed to 25.27% (95%CI, 20.33 \u2212 32.81), about two 221 and a half fold increase, R e became greater than one resulting in potential community spread ( Figure 4B ). These 222 results indicate that quarantining infected persons before symptom onset effectively can significantly reduce the 223 risk of community spread. 224 We further studied the timing of the start of the quarantine which was critical for the suppression of the COVID-225 19 outbreaks in the presence of some level of population immunity under different social distancing scenarios. 226",

Overall, the detection rates of the local cases were lower than those of the imported 243 cases because the number of local infected cases increased faster than quarantined cases. Our model estimated 244 that 71%(43 \u2212 90) of local cases and 88% (58 -99) of imported cases were detected at the end of the study 245 period. However, a delay in starting quarantine of one day reduced the daily detection rate for local infections 246 to 59%(38 \u2212 74) ( Figure 6B ). Only 31%(20 \u2212 40) of cases could be detected if quarantine was delayed by 6 247 days. The results showed that not only can early quarantine reduce the chance of transmission, but it also has the 248 benefit of increasing the overall detection rate.

As the 282 level of population immunity increases, the critical timing of the start of quarantine can be relaxed. Compliance 283 with social distancing rules tends to weaken once the incidence of local cases is reduced, however, the proposed 284 time-sensitive quarantine measures are adaptive to changes in population immunity level and social distancing 285 compliance, which can provide public health authorities with an achievable and measurable target. without symptoms for about three days during the latent period. This result confirms the similar pre-symptomatic 290 transmission periods found by several recent studies which were using contact tracing and enhanced investigation 291 of clusters of confirmed cases [14] [15] [16] [17] and gives reason to support an early quarantine for any persons who have 292 been exposed but remain asymptomatic.

Note that because the effects of quarantine and hospital isolation can be considered to be similar 143 in terms of restrictions on movement to limit contacts in the outside world, patients in quarantine at home or at a 144 designated facility, or in hospital isolation were all treated equally and given quarantine (Q) status to simplify the 145 model mechanism. Thus, the definition of a newly detected infected cases was based on the assumption that all 146 confirmed cases in Hong Kong were either quarantined or isolated. The cases that are recovered without having 147 been quarantined or isolated are not detected. The daily number of newly detected imported cases with symptom 148 onset was used as the expected value of the mean of the Poisson distribution and was derived as \u2206I imp (\u03c3)D imp , 149",
