Previous studies using the same molecular diagnostic strategy reported sensitivity ranging from 2.0 \u00d7 101 to 1.0 \u00d7 102 copies/reaction, indicating that this RT-LAMP test kit has extremely high sensitivity and is also valuable for diagnosis, in terms of not only its convenience but also its detection sensitivity [7,8]. It is highly specific because it uses a set of four primers that recognize at least six different sequences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the present study, it was considered that there was no nonspecific amplification with the RT-LAMP test kit. The results for two samples, re-collected at more than 1 week after the initial SARS-CoV-2-positive result, were inconsistent with those for RT-qPCR (RT-LAMP was positive, whereas RT-qPCR was negative). This phenomenon may depend on the concentration gradient or the aspiration rate in the RNA extracts because the amount of sample used for RT-qPCR was 5 \u03bcL, while that used for RT-LAMP was 10 \u03bcL.",
