As a result, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact, making it highly contagious.",

Despite the observation of increased vulnerability in elderly, literature concerning geriatric patients with COVID-19 remained very scant. Most of the studies were editorial commentaries (Nicol et al., 2020; Garnier-Crussard et al., 2020; Le Couteur et al., 2020; Doraiswamy et al., 2020) and clinical studies of a cohort of patients of varying ages admitted to a hospital with a slight highlight on the association between age and clinical manifestations (Chen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Given that elderly aged 60 or above only accounted for about 6% of the total Chinese population, clinical studies based on a single hospital may not be informative. Against this background, the present study identified the risk factors for predicting mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19 by reviewing the clinical data of deceased and discharged COVID-19 patients gathered from the public domain.",

In fact, the data in the present study suggested that patients without fever were more likely to be older (crude OR 0.952. 95% CI 0.910, 0.996). This phenomenon is not uncommon and perhaps overlooked. A recent study reviewing the clinical features of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hainan General Hospital found significant difference in the prevalence of fever between young and middle-aged, and elderly patients (Liu et al., 2020). However, the authors did not further discuss this finding. It has also been suggested that approximately 20%-30% of elderly patients with serious bacterial or viral infection presented with a blunted or even no fever (Norman, 2000). It is likely because of the lower baseline body temperature in elderly due to aging (Castle et al., 1991; Obermeyer et al., 2017; G\u00fcne\u015f and Zaybak, 2008; Lu et al., 2010; Simonsick et al., 2016) which may translate to a lower maximum temperature of fever (Norman, 2000). This suggests that the usual temperature threshold for fever should not be used as a case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients. In fact, a study on a total of 111 nursing home residents found that lowering the threshold for a clinically significant fever increased the sensitivity of detecting infections (Castle et al., 1993). However, it is not recommended to lower the temperature threshold in the case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients because an individual\u2019s baseline body temperature is also determined by a range of demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and physiological measurements (Obermeyer et al., 2017). To assist surveillance against the current pandemic, elderly should measure on a regular basis the baseline body temperature that can be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. If this is not feasible, a baseline body temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius might be used instead (G\u00fcne\u015f and Zaybak, 2008).",

A recent hypertension prevalence study in the Chinese population found that hypertension was observed in 58.4% of Chinese aged 60 or above (Lu et al., 2017) which falls between 41.6% and 64.5%, the 95% CI of the proportion of deceased patients with hypertension (Table 2). Therefore, whether mortality is associated with hypertension in geriatric patients remains uncertain. Similar observations were found in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and stroke. The prevalence of COPD and stroke in the Chinese population aged 60 or above were found to be 15.5% (Zhong et al., 2007) (or higher given the recent increasing trend (Wang et al., 2018)) and 11%-14% (Wang et al., 2020b), respectively. The 95% CI of the prevalence of COPD and stroke in the deceased patients considered in the present study were 7.8%-25.4% and 5.7%-21.8%, respectively. In contrast, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) might be associated with mortality. The prevalence of diabetes and CHD in the Chinese population aged 60 or above was found 19%-21% (Wang et al., 2017) and 6%-7% (Wang et al., 2020b), respectively, failing to overlap with the corresponding 95% CI of the proportion of deceased patients included in the present study.",
