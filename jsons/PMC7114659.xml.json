            "text": "Viruses are fascinating products of evolution and life-threatening pathogens at the same time. Indeed, these non-cellular assemblies of macromolecules and lipids are simpler than even minimalistic replicating cells but can infect living organisms in both plant and animal kingdoms. Throughout history, viral infections repeatedly had a devastating effect on human society and even in modern times, viral outbreaks create an enormous socio-economic burden [1,2]. Recent examples include the outbreaks of coronavirus-associated Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndromes (SARS, MERS) as well as the Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks. To counter this, interdisciplinary efforts have been made over the past decades in the design and development of antiviral drugs. In large part, this was spurred by the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [3]. Currently, there are nearly one hundred antiviral drugs approved by the US FDA [4]. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain. It is now understood that a significant limitation of current strategies is that countermeasures to viral pathogens are most typically developed individually and specifically to each emerging pathogen. An aspect that came into the focus of research attention is the development of \u201cbroad-spectrum antiviral agents\u201d [5].",

            "text": "Such agents can constitute prophylactic, [6] preventative, [7,8] or curative [9,10] measures. Prophylaxis (vaccination) holds a great appeal but universal antiviral vaccines are yet to be developed [6]. In fact, the overall majority of pathogenic viruses have no corresponding vaccination product. In turn, curative measures are highly attractive in their own right. However, while replicational cycles of viruses are similar, there is a great variability between viral enzymes and other proteins that could serve as drug targets \u2013 making the design of universal antiviral agents challenging [4]. Interferon is an endogenous protein that serves as a potent stimulatory signal to human immunity and acts as a non-specific, broadly acting antiviral agent. However, viruses developed multiple interferon inhibitors which compromise induction or activity of interferon [11]. Moreover, due to its side effects, its clinical use is limited [12]. Several small molecule drugs also serve as broadly acting antivirals. Of these, ribavirin (RBV) has a long history of medicinal use and appears on the World Health Organization list of essential medicines for both adults and children [13,14]. However, this drug also has a dose limiting toxicity. Several other experimental drug leads are in different stages of (pre)clinical development [[15], [16], [17], [18]].",

            "text": "Finally, preventative antivirals that act through neutralization of viruses and/or blocking virus cell entry appear to be highly promising as broad-spectrum antiviral agents [[19], [20], [21]]. A notable class of such agents is polymers. In the early 1940s, it was first observed that viruses interact with polymers [22] and inhibit virus infectivity [23]. Over subsequent decades, this effect was shown to be affecting viral pathogens across the viral genus and families, and observed for polymers diverse in their structure, natural and synthetic, positively or negatively charged [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. De Clercq et al. proposed that activity of the negatively charged polymers, at least in vivo, is indirect and proceeds via stimulation of interferon production [30]. However, antiviral activity proceeds potently and efficaciously in vitro, in absence of interferon, and the direct contact between polymers and the virus with ensuing neutralizing activity is now well-documented. Inherent skepticism towards polyanions and other polymers as antivirals [31] originates in the failures of hallmark clinical trials for these agents both when administered systemically or as topical microbicides [7]. Specifically for systemic administration, it has been concluded that preventative antiviral effect would have to rely on a sustained, high concentration of these agents in blood not achievable without toxic effects [31]. However, other polymers are successfully commercialized as antivirals, specifically as lubricants in condoms acting as microbicides with activity against HIV and herpes simplex viruses [32]. Nucleic acid based polyanions progress through clinical trials as agents against hepatitis B virus with potential of further development as broad-spectrum antiviral activity [20]. It is important to note that failed clinical trials are indeed discouraging yet important, game-changing developments have occurred in polymer chemistry in recent decades. Specifically, novel polymerization techniques are now available to afford polymers with well-controlled molar mass and architecture and a significantly broader available polymer functionality (side chains) [33,34]. Another notable advancement includes the development of polymeric virucidal agents that compromise stability of the viral envelope and exert permanent damage to the virion [35,36]. Together, the broad spectrum of activity of polymers against viral pathogens and the chemical versatility of these agents renders this class of antiviral agents unique and attractive for deeper investigation.",

Our broad study considered 14 polymers, infectious Zika virus, HIV, and HSV, as well as pseudotyped viral particles for Ebola, Lassa, Lyssa, SARS, and other viruses. The main finding of our work was that anionic charge alone (be it carboxylate, phosphate/phosphonate, or sulfonate) did not endow the polymer with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Decisive factor for such activity was the enhanced (but balanced) hydrophobicity of the macromolecule. Identified lead candidate polymers exhibited antiviral activity against all the enveloped viral pathogens, including the Zika virus. For the latter, we presented evidence of direct contact between the polymer and the viral particle and concurrent inhibition of viral infectivity [21].",

Such agents represent a combination therapy wherein the carrier exerts extracellular preventative effect [21] whereas the conjugated drug, once released inside the cell, is an intracellularly active therapeutic [37]. It is also possible that polyanions have an intracellular antiviral effect of their own, that is the inhibition of viral polymerases, [40,45,46] presumably through competitive electrostatic interaction with the protein. In this work, we explore the design of such combination therapy in detail. We focus on the choice of the macromolecular backbone as a carrier for the conjugated drug and analyze blood coagulation, binding to albumin, albumin aggregation, inhibitory activity on polymerases, and cytotoxicity for polymers differed by their anionic charge (carboxylates, phosphates and phosphonates, sulfonates). Further, we synthesize ribavirin-containing counterparts to the polyanions, investigate kinetics of drug release for the resulting macromolecular prodrugs, and investigate their use for intracellular drug delivery of ribavirin in an anti-inflammatory model in macrophages. As a result, we identify polymers and macromolecular prodrugs that are devoid of blood anti-coagulation activity but are strong as inhibitors of polymerases and efficacious as delivery vehicles for ribavirin \u2013 thus being attractive for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We also identified polymers that are benign and devoid of any activity in these tests thus being attractive as \u201cstealth\u201d materials for diverse biomedical applications [47]. Results of this study would be important for the advancement of biomedical engineering, specifically with regards to development of antiviral therapies and drug delivery techniques.",

Synthetic approach to the synthesis of the corresponding macromolecular prodrugs was chosen to proceed via copolymerization of the drug containing monomer and that corresponding to the carrier polymer. Towards this end, RBV containing monomers were designed to be compatible with polymerization of diverse co-monomers, acrylic and methacrylic, hydrophilic and hydrophobic (Fig. 2\n). Of these, the synthesis of the hydrophobic methacrylate monomer (monomer 1 in Fig. 2) was reported in our previous publications [43]. Acrylic counterparts were obtained via similar protocols with minor variations. Design consideration also concerned polarity of co-monomers, an aspect that exerts limitations to the choice of the solvent for polymerization. Polarity of the applied anionic monomers varied from those with a hydrophilic character (phosphates/phosphonates) to those with well pronounced hydrophobic character (ethylacrylic acid, propylacrylic acid). RBV monomers were therefore designed to mimic the polarity of the anionic comonomers through the use of silyl protecting groups to render the monomer more hydrophobic or using deprotected, hydrophilic 2\u2032,3\u2032-hydroxyl containing monomers. In total four different RBV prodrug monomers were applied (Fig. 2), allowing for the copolymerization to be performed under hydrophobic and hydrophilic conditions with either acrylate/acrylamide or methacrylate/methacrylamide containing monomers. In each case, the monomer structure also comprised a disulfide bond for intracellular degradation, coupled to a self-immolative linker for drug release [48].",

Polymers were also characterized through size exclusion chromatography (using an 8-angle static light scattering detector) to determine the molar mass and dispersity of the polymer samples (Table 1). We acknowledge that (co)polymers exhibited variability in their degree of polymerization (molar mass). For this reason, analyses presented below do not take into account the likely, non-negligible influence of molar mass on the properties of the polymers. In doing so, we assume that the polymer structure is the factor determining the polymer properties whereas the molar mass is of secondary importance.

Indeed, depending on structure, polyanions may exhibit anticoagulation effect, [49] as is well-known for heparin, [50] a polysaccharide approved by the US FDA specifically for the purpose of blood anticoagulation. Other polyanions such as polyphosphates (nucleic acids) are reported to be pro-coagulants [51]. No interference with blood coagulation is a highly desired safety feature of injectable formulations and identification of coagulation-inert polymers was one of the aims of this study. We investigated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in presence of the synthesized polyanions. The platelet-depleted plasma from healthy donors was incubated with polyanions at concentrations of 10 or 100 mg/L and the aPTT was measured (Fig. 3\n). Polysulfonates and PVBzA at 100 mg/L enhanced blood coagulation time to a value over 150 s, similarly to heparin, and this indicates that they are strong blood anti-coagulants. This was also observed with PVPA, which doubled the aPTT value. In contrast, other polyphosphates and polyphosphonates PAPA, PMPA, PAEP and PMEP had minor if any influence on blood coagulation time. Of the carboxylates, PAA and PMAA exhibited a noticeable anti-coagulation effect. In contrast, PEAA and PPAA, two polymers with an enhanced hydrophobicity but decreased anionic character compared to PAA and PMAA (higher pKa) had no effect on blood coagulation time at 10 mg/L. Taken together, results in Fig. 3 reveal that six out of the tested 14 polymers (polyphosphates, polyphosphonates, PEAA and PPAA) appear to have no inhibitory activity with regards to the blood coagulation times.",

            "text": "Albumin is the most abundant protein in human plasma. It has numerous physiological functions that include the maintenance of osmotic pressure and the transport of hydrophobic solutes through the blood. This protein is safe-guarded by the body and physiological mechanisms exist to ensure that albumin is not degraded but retained in the body. As a result, albumin blood residence time reaches a phenomenal value of 3 weeks [52]. Albumin binding is among the most successful methodologies in biomedicine to extend the circulation times of solutes and this has been achieved to a range of drug molecules, from small molecule anticancer drugs [53] to peptide hormones and proteins [54]. Recently, we observed that synthetic polymers (PEAA) can bind albumin and this afforded hepatic deposition of the polymer [55]. Albumin binding for PEAA is not altogether surprising in that this protein is well known to bind hydrophobic solutes and anionic solutes, both features being emphasized in the structure of PEAA. Herein, we aimed to investigate albumin binding for the library of anionic polymers, with and without conjugation of ribavirin. Albumin has several binding sites, most notable of which are the so-called Sudlow I and Sudlow II sites [56,57]. Binding of solutes to these sites can be interrogated using fluorescent probes that exhibit site-specific biding to albumin, specifically dansyl asparagine (Sudlow I) and dansyl sarcosine (Sudlow II) [56]. Fluorescence of these probes is significantly decreased upon displacement from the protein globule, and this presents itself as a facile methodology to quantitate binding of albumin with the polymers. Polymers were mixed with albumin at 5 \u03bcM (0.33 g/L) concentration of the protein and 10 molar equivalents of the polymer to albumin. The immediate observation from the results of these experiments (Fig. 4\n) is that polymers differed significantly in their capacity to interact with albumin via the two nominated sites.",

PAPA also exhibited no anticoagulation activity (Fig. 3), and together these data suggest that PAPA is a blood-safe carrier for diverse drug delivery applications. Albumin binding for the structurally similar PMPA as well as the phosphate analogues PAEP and PMEP was also not pronounced and at 10-fold mole excess of the polymer to albumin, probe fluorescence decreased by no more than 50%. Polysulfonates also exhibited minor association with albumin and afforded no change in fluorescence for the Sudlow I binding probe and a change in fluorescence for the Sudlow II probe within 50%. Exception to this was the most hydrophobic of these polymers, styrenic PSVBS which showed a 75% probe displacement. In contrast, polycarboxylates exhibited a strong tendency for binding with albumin and exhibited a highly efficacious probe displacement. Binding was not site specific and probes were displaced from both Sudlow I and II sites. In the case of PAA, displacement of probes for both Sudlow I and II sites was near-complete indicating a strong binding. For this polymer, incorporation of RBV abrogated polymer binding to albumin. This illustrates that PAA binding to albumin is structure-programmed and change to this macromolecule such as addition of RBV interferes with albumin binding. PMAA, PEAA and PPAA also exhibited strong probe displacement capacity albeit not as pronounced as PAA. Interestingly, unlike PAA-RBV, PEAA-RBV and PPAA-RBV were strong albumin binders.",

In contrast, for the carboxylates PAA, PMAA, PPAA, PVBZA and the hydrophobic polysulfonate PSVBS, polymer-protein interaction afforded strong aggregation and formation of high molar mass products (MDa).

            "text": "Next, we examined macromolecular prodrugs with regards to the kinetics of drug release. RBV conjugation was designed such as to be reversed upon the scission of the disulfide linkage, specifically upon cell entry. Intracellular environment is characterized by a relatively high concentration of a thiol containing tripeptide, glutathione (GSH), [58] and this effectively triggers the degradation of disulfide linkages inside the cells [[59], [60], [61]]. Accessibility of the disulfide within the structure of macromolecular prodrugs can vary due to the difference in the size of the side groups functionalities. Polymers may thus exhibit significant differences in the drug release kinetics. We have previously investigated the release of RBV and other drugs conjugated to polymers via the same linkage as used in this study (disulfide trigger paired with a self-immolative linker) via HPLC [43,46,62]. Herein, we established an 1H NMR-based method to quantify the release of RBV as illustrated in Fig. 6\non an example of PAPA-RBV. Macromolecular prodrug was incubated in the presence of GSH. Disulfide reshuffling initiates the spontaneous cyclization of the self-immolative linker with ensuing release of the pristine drug, ribavirin (Fig. 6, A). Chemical shift of the ribavirin protons exhibits a well-defined migration in the 1H NMR spectrum and with time, the signal corresponding to the polymer-bound drug decreases whereas that for the free RBV increases (Fig. 6, B). Integration of the corresponding peaks provides a facile means to quantify RBV bound to the polymer and released from the prodrug. Release of RBV from the macromolecular prodrug was fast and within 1 h, over 75% of the drug was released from the macromolecular carrier (Fig. 7\n). This kinetics profile is highly advantageous, significantly faster than that reported for the peptide-based linkers between the drug and the carrier, [63] and allows for rapid drug release upon prodrug cell entry. We note that data in Fig. 7 are rather similar to the drug release data collected in our prior studies via HPLC [43,46,62] and this serves to validate the established herein NMR-based approach to monitor drug release.",

A significant finding from this experiment was that hydrophobicity of the polymer chain has a pronounced effect on the kinetics of drug release. In contrast, no such correlation appears to exist with regards to the charge of the polymer (anionic vs charge neutral) or the nature of the negative charge on the polymer. Indeed, structurally similar PHPMA and PMAA as well as PAPA and PAEP released ribavirin quantitatively within 2 h revealing no difference in drug release kinetics. However, relatively small structural change from PMAA to PEAA or from PEAA to PPAA afforded a significant decrease in the drug release. Similarly, a single methyl group variation from PAPA to PMPA afforded a pronounced drop in the amount of RBV released within 2 h. A likely explanation to this phenomenon is the more compact, less hydrated and thus less accessible polymer coil for increasingly hydrophobic polymers which hinder GSH from initiating drug release.",

The spectrum of polyanionic endogenous compounds is rather large, and competition [64] for electrostatic interactions with these polymeric partners is highly likely. In the context of antiviral performance of the polymers, we [65] [46] and others [45] have shown that polyanions can act as efficient inhibitors of polymerases. Charge neutral polymers were devoid of such activity [65] pointing to the anionic charge of the polymer (that is, electrostatic interaction with the target) as the origin of the observed phenomenon. Polymers synthesized in this work were analyzed as inhibitors of two types of polymerase enzymes, namely a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (replicase) and an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), Fig. 9\n. Despite being similar in carrying multiple anionic charges, polymers differed markedly in their ability to interfere with the performance of polymerases. Polyphosphates and polyphosphonates were nearly devoid of any inhibitory activity in these assays and regardless of the polymer concentration, polymerases remained uninhibited. Together with the data presented above, e.g. PAPA appears to have unique \u201cstealth-like\u201d properties with no-interference in coagulation assays, albumin binding, and competition for binding with polymerases. In contrast, polycarboxylates and polysulfonates exhibited a dose-dependent polymerase inhibition. A rather surprising finding is that high anionic character alone does not make the polymer a strong inhibitor and in the homologous row of carboxylates, it was PEAA that exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity (complete inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity at 1 mg/L polymer concentration). This observation echoes our recent findings on the apparent unique pairing of negative character and hydrophobicity of the polymer backbone that renders PEAA an efficacious inhibitor of e.g. hepatitis C virus intracellular replication [55] and a lead polymer with broad-spectrum antiviral activity [21]. Similar observation can be made for the negatively charged PVBzA, also characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity of the chain due to the aromatic ring in each repeat unit of the polymer.",

Our previous findings revealed that PAA-RBV inhibited the synthesis of an inflammatory marker nitric oxide (NO) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages whereby both the polymer and the released drug elicited their individual anti-inflammatory activity [65]. We tested the library of polyanions presented above and quantified inflammatory responses in cells incubated with polymers in a range of concentrations from 0.32 to 200 mg/L. Independently, metabolic activity of the cells (indicative of cell viability) was measured by the Presto Blue assay. These experiments therefore provide information on both, toxicity of the polymers to macrophages in cell culture and anti-inflammatory activity of the polymers.",

The overall majority of polymers were also devoid of activity with regards to inflammation. However, several polymers comprised notable exceptions and were efficacious inhibitors of inflammation without associated toxicity to the cells. Specifically, among the polyanions, PMAA, PEAA, PVBzA and PSVBS afforded significant decrease in the levels of NO produced by macrophages. An apparent unifying structural feature of these four polymers is that these are the most hydrophobic of the polyanions used in this work. Decreased inflammatory response by PVBzA and PSVBS was observed already at 8 mg/L making these polymers most potent of the tested polyanions. It is also striking that these two polymers, as well as PEAA, afforded a highly efficacious decrease in the synthesis of NO with a near-complete suppression of inflammation without associated toxicity to the cells. This comes in stark contrast with the RBV based treatment which could only afford ca. 50% reduction in the levels of NO at sub-toxic concentrations of the drug [37]. It is worthy of note that polyanions are typically deemed to have restricted cell entry [66]. However, confocal laser scanning microscopy evaluation of the polymer uptake by macrophages revealed pronounced polymer-associated fluorescence inside the cells (Fig. 11\n). This was true for all polymers: polycarboxylates, polyphosphates and polyphosphonates, and polysulfonate. Contrary to expectations, cell entry does not appear to be decisive in the observed activity of the polymers.",

It is likely that both the polymer and the released drug contribute to the overall anti-inflammatory response in macrophages for PMAA-RBV and PEAA-RBV. Surprising other leads in this assay were macromolecular prodrugs based on PMPA and PAMPS.

Indeed, the latter has anionic component to it and competion with polyanions for interaction with the receptor is not inconceivable. Furthermore, prior reports suggested that sulfated polyaromatic suramin can antagonize LPS [67]. To investigate this on the example of PEAA, LPS stimulation of macrophages was performed using increasing concentration of LPS in the presence or absence of a fixed concentration of the polymer (Fig. 12\n). In this assay, antagonism at the receptor in absence of intracellular effects would manifest itself as a shift in the potency of LPS without a change in efficacy. In turn, intracellular effects in absence of receptor antagonism would mean a decreased efficacy of the inflammatory response with no change in the potency of LPS. Experimental data suggest that both effects are likely observed (Fig. 12) and PEAA exerts its activity through both, receptor antagonism and intracellular effects. Indeed, the polymer affords statistically significant decrease in the inflammation and also a change, albeit a very minor one, in the IC50 value for LPS with regards to stimulation of macrophages (0.42 vs 0.24 mg/L in the presence of PEAA).",

            "text": "First, we wish to evaluate the validity of our assumption that polymer degree of polymerization (molar mass) is of secondary importance compared to the decisive role of the chemistry of the polymer. Indeed, variability between polymers used in this work by the number of repeat units in the chain (Table 2) can mask or skew the observed effects and lead to false negatives or misinterpretation of data. Furthermore, terminal groups arising from the different RAFT agents used in this study to produce the polymers may also considerably change polymer properties [68]. With regards to the latter point, we note that in our hands, macromolecular prodrugs of RBV prior to and after removal of their cleavable end-groups revealed no difference in the anti-inflammatory activity [42]. In this work, to accommodate the synthetic diversity of polymers, we used five different RAFT agents (Table 1) and we see no correlation of polymer activity (Table 2) and the RAFT agent used for the polymer synthesis. Similarly, experimental results presented in this work appear to show no correlation with the polymer molar mass. Blood anti-coagulation effect of the polymers (Fig. 3) shows strong dependence on the nature of the polymer charged functionality (sulfonates > carboxylates > phosphates and phosphonates) but not with MN (DP). Albumin binding results (probe displacement results, Fig. 4) illustrate that polycarboxylates are strong albumin binders despite the variation of molar mass while phosphate-containing polyanions are weak binders, even the highest molar mass PAPA. Drug release kinetics for macromolecular prodrugs (Fig. 8) shows a statistically significant correlation with the polymer hydrophobicity but not with polymer DP. Polymers most active in RBV delivery were not those characterized by the lowest or the highest DP (in fact, the lowest and the highest DP polymers were not effective in this screen) suggesting that polymer structure, not the number of repeat units in the structure, is decisive in the utility of the polymer as a carrier for the conjugated drug. Without doubt, examples of strong, pronounced effects of molar mass on the biomedical properties of polymers are numerous and importance of this factor should not be overlooked. In our own prior work, with regards to the delivery of RBV, we found that high molar mass restricted the polymer cell entry and in doing so limited the observed therapeutic effects [39,65]. Not disregarding the importance of these observations, the data of this study strongly suggest chemical structure of the polymer is a dominant factor in its properties (at least in the experiments presented in this study) whereas polymer chain length is of secondary importance.",

In turn, weak anti-coagulants and weak albumin binders are also weak inhibitors of virus infectivity. This conclusion may not be altogether surprising in that both anti-coagulation and antiviral effects are likely due to the interaction between the polymers and a proteinaceous target (for antiviral effects \u2013 glycoproteins of the virus capsid).
