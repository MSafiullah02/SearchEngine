The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the invading viruses may be recognized by PRRs. Then, the adaptor proteins (TRIF forTLR3, MyD88 for TLR7/8/9, MAVS/IPS-1 for RIG-I) would be recruited, and the infecting signals would be transmitted to the downstream kinase complexes, followed by the activation of transcription factors, such as interferon regulatoryfactor-3 (IRF-3), nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and ATF-2/c-jun [2,[5], [6], [7]]. Upon activated, the transcription factors may regulate the expression of type I Interferons which induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and ultimately establish the antiviral function of the host [4,[8], [9], [10]].",

In this study, we observed that MCPIP1 inhibits the IFN\u03b2 expression activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1, IRF3. Additionally, MCPIP1 inhibits the nuclear migration of IRF3. Furthermore, MCPIP1 interacts with TRAF3 and disrupts TRAF3-TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex which is essential for the activation of IFN\u03b2 production pathway. This report suggests that MCPIP1 may act as an IFN antagonist antiviral protein encoded by the host and uncovers the mechanism undergoes by MCPIP1 to inhibit IFN\u03b2 innate immune pathway.",

Luciferase reporter gene detection showed that IRF3-dependent IFN\u03b2 activation was significantly inhibited by MCPIP1 (Fig. 1B).

As shown in Fig. 3B, we observed that IRF3 was activated by SeV infection and migrated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

We showed that (1) MCPIP1 inhibits NF-\u03baB activity and IFN\u03b2 expression pathway activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1 and IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner. (2) MCPIP1 interacts with IRF3 and inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation with virus. (3) MCPIP1 interacts with the key modulators of IFN\u03b2 expression pathway including IPS1, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5. (4) MCPIP1 disrupts the interaction between the components of TRAF3-TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex and inhibits the corresponding IFN\u03b2 expression.

Liang et al. have discovered that MCPIP1 may be a deubiquitinase and defined a novel DUB domain of MCPIP1 [22]. Ubiquitin and deubiquitin modification emerge as the key mechanisms that regulate the virus-induced type I IFN signaling pathways [[39], [40], [41], [42]]. Several cellular DUB proteins play important roles in negative regulation of host innate immunity. We previously found that several CoV encoded proteins also negatively regulate IFN\u03b2 expression of the host through DUB activity [15,16,21]. Based on these, we hypothesis that MCPIP1 may also inhibits IFN\u03b2 innate immune in cells. The results in this study that MCPIP1 inhibits NF-\u03baB activity and IFN\u03b2 expression pathway activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1 and IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner yielded evidence for our hypothesis.",

This innate antiviral response is initiated when viral PAMPs were detected by the host via a number of cellular PRRs, such as the membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) [[1], [2], [3]]. These PRRs would recruit different adaptor molecules upon engagement of their respective ligands, submitting signals to downstream kinases that activate IRF3, NF-\u03baB and other transcription factors that coordinately regulate IFN\u03b2 transcription [2,7]. IRF3 is a constitutively expressed, latent transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in type I IFN responses. The activation of IRF3 requires specific C-terminal phosphorylation. IRF3 may be activated upon phosphorylation mediated by TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, which leads to its homodimerization, nuclear translocation, and collaboration with activated NF-\u03baB to induce IFN\u03b2 synthesis [[43], [44], [45]].",

We have previously reported that PLP and 3CLpro encoded by CoVs negatively regulate IFN\u03b2 expression of the host [14,16]. In this study, we observed that MCPIP1 inhibited NF-\u03baB activity and IFN\u03b2 expression pathway activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1 and IRF3 in the host cells. Furthermore, the formation of TRAF3-TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex is an essential step in the activation of IRF3 [46]. In this study, we found that when MCPIP1 was co-expressed in the cell, the interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 was significantly disrupted, suggesting the TRAF3-TBK1-IKK\u03b5 complex and the submitting signals to downstream kinases were blocked. Upon stimulation with virus, IRF3 migrated towards the nuclear. However, the nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by viral was inhibited when co-expressed with MCPIP1. Taking our previously foundation together with the report by Liang et al. [21,22], we think that the DUB activation of MCPIP1 plays important role in its negatively regulation of IFN expression pathway, which is similar to A20 [12,[47], [48], [49]].",
