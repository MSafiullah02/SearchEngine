The unparalleled rate at which many research groups around the world are releasing data and publications on the ongoing pandemic is allowing other scientists to learn from local experiences and data generated in the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need to integrate additional data sources that map and measure the role of social dynamics of such a unique world-wide event into biomedical, biological, and epidemiological analyses. For this purpose, we present a large-scale curated dataset of over 152 million tweets, growing daily, related to COVID-19 chatter generated from January 1st to April 4th at the time of writing. This open dataset will allow researchers to conduct a number of research projects relating to the emotional and mental responses to social distancing measures, the identification of sources of misinformation, and the stratified measurement of sentiment towards the pandemic in near real time.",

Unfortunately, the interventions to contain its spread were not implemented soon enough to limit the spread of the virus within China's borders. While transmission has been dramatically reduced in China through strict social distancing interventions, the virus was exported to multiple countries and is now generating sustained transmission in multiple areas of the world, including areas with active hotspots of the disease including the United States, Italy, Spain, and France 1 . As of April 4th, 1,201,453 cases have been recorded including 64,688 deaths according to the worldometer coronavirus pandemic tracker 2 .",

            "text": "While the ongoing COVID-19 presents with unprecedented challenges to humanity, the wider scientific community can only advance science when they have access to openly available data. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook contain an abundance of text data that can be utilized for research purposes. Over the last decade, Twitter has proven to be a valuable resource during disasters for many-to-many crisis communication 3 , 4,5 . With Twitter data, it is possible to analyze symptom configurations, risk factors, origin, virus genetics, and spread patterns can be studied and monitored [6] [7] [8] . Recent studies 9,10 prove that data sharing improves quality and strengthens research, with collaborative efforts providing an opportunity for researchers to continually enhance research ideas and avoid redundant efforts 11, 12 . We opted to release our data to the public for the greater good when the dataset accumulated 40 million tweets on March 23rd 13 . We have been providing updates every two days 14 , with a cumulative update every week, most recently on March 29th 15 . This previous update had over 100 million tweets available for researchers. The community response by word of mouth has led to over 2,401 views and over 1,177 downloads of the resource. Moreover, several international researchers have reached out to contribute data and provide analysis expertise. In this release we have incorporated additional data provided by our co-authors expanding the size of the dataset to over 152,920,832 tweets and added vital data on the early days of the pandemic which was unavailable during the initial data collection effort. This shows the value of this kind of data and the engagement of scientists that come together to create extensive resources for the benefit of society. Aside from providing the full dataset with retweets included, we provide a clean version with no retweets for researchers with limited resources to access a lighter version of the dataset. Furthermore, to assist researchers for NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms, 1000 bigrams, and 1000 trigrams. The released dataset adheres with FAIR principles 16 . Due to Twitter's terms of service, tweet text cannot be shared. Therefore, tweet ids are publicly made available using Zenodo 13 . The tweet ids can be hydrated using tools like Social Media Mining Toolkit or twarc 17, 18 . The deliverables 13, 14 include tweet ids and code to process the tweets. Please note that the code to process the tweets would work only after the tweets are hydrated. We provided the date and time meta-data elements on our dataset for groups wanting to target their research questions to certain days to avoid having to hydrate the whole resource at once. We have automated pipelines to continue collecting tweets as the pandemic runs its course and to provide updates every two days on our Github repository. We are also welcoming any additional data that provides new tweets to our resource.",

We shifted our focus to collect exclusively COVID-19 tweets on March 12th, 2020 with the following keywords: \"COVD19\", \"CoronavirusPandemic\", \"COVID-19\", \"2019nCoV\", \"CoronaOutbreak\", \"coronavirus\", \"WuhanVirus\", thus the number of tweets gathered dramatically expanded the dataset. Please note that the Stream API only allows free access to a one percent sample of the daily stream of Twitter. Our methodology relies on Python and the Tweepy package 19 , as in our previous work 20 . We recently received another set of 30+ Million tweets collected from January 27th, 2020 to March 27th, 2020 from our co-author, Jingyuan Yu, and his collaborators with the following keywords: \"coronavirus\", \"wuhan\", \"pneumonia\", \"pneumonie\", \"neumonia\", \"lungenentz\u00fcndung\", \"covid19\". These tweets were collected in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, and German, while our original collection is done for any language available. We have fully integrated and deduplicated our collaborators' tweet collection with ours, thus the numbers and tweets presented in this dataset are of unique tweet identifiers from January 1st to April 4th (at the time of writing). Table 1 represents the monthly number of tweets included in this dataset. As previously mentioned, the number of collected tweets increased tremendously since starting dedicated collection. All our preprocessing scripts utilize components of the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT) 17 . We make a distinction between our full and clean versions of the dataset. The full dataset consists of both tweets and retweets. There are several practical reasons to leave the retweets; tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. A clean version with no retweets is also released, intended for NLP researchers.",

As shown in Figure 1 , we used SMMT to listen to the Twitter Stream API for tweets with the described keywords. We then gather all the tweets that have the desired keywords before aggregating them locally. Our contributors used a similar procedure to gather their tweets and provided us with tab delimited files with their data. We processed them to fit our own local format to be able to include them in our dataset after deduplication (removal of tweets we have in common) and only keep unique tweet identifiers between the datasets. We then preprocess the large set of tweets to extract the shareable meta-data of the full dataset (tweet_id, collected date, collected time), preparing the full_dataset.tsv.gz file. At the same time we also remove tweets that are re-tweeted (this is, existing tweets that are re-shared by others) to create the full_dataset-clean.tsv.gz file. Our preprocessing involves cleaning up special characters, such as carriage returns, removing urls and large blank spaces. Our preprocessing is rather relaxed as we are leaving all available languages intact. To generate the frequent terms and ngrams (sets of n-terms that appear constantly together), we remove all stop words in English and Spanish, using the Spacy 21 . These lists are originally quite large, so we only share the top 1000 terms, bigrams, and trigrams. We continue to update our original dataset every two days 14 with major releases every week 13, 15 and plan to continue doing this for at least the next 12 months, a period that will likely cover the main pandemic period.",

The full_dataset.tsv consists of all the procured tweet ids. The full_dataset-clean.tsv contains only original tweets with no retweets.

Note that the tweets need to be hydrated first using tools like Social Media Mining Toolkit or twarc 17, 18 . Once the tweets are hydrated and a JSON object has been returned, we use the files parse_json_extreme.py and parse_json_extreme_clean.py to extract the tweet identifier, date of creation, text, language and a few other extra fields. This process can be configured by adding which fields from the tweet json object the user wants to extract in the fields.py file. These utilities produce a full and a clean version of the dataset respectively, on a tab delimited file. This process is optimized to read large files without loading them fully in memory. If the user has a system with very large amounts of RAM memory, we also provide parse_json_lite.py to perform the same task. Once the JSON object has been parsed, most users will be able to operate on the tweets directly this way. We additionally provide the get_1grams.py and get_ngrams.py utilities to generate the most frequent terms and bigrams and trigrams, respectively. As the hydrated tweet JSON objects are typically quite large, we recommend separating them in daily batches to be able to more efficiently process them. All our previously mentioned tools take a single file as an input parameter for processing and output a new file. In order to combine the results of the ngram generation from multiple files, we prove the following tools that take a folder path as input and iterate through all files present: combine1grams.py, combineNgrams.py . In order to share the tweet identifiers with other groups, we provide the getDataset.py, getDataset_clean.py files which generate the equivalent files of full_dataset.tsv and full_dataset-clean.tsv that are presented in this resource in a compressed (zip) maner. Lastly, dataset statistics can be calculated with getStats.py , by passing the full or clean dataset filename to them.",
