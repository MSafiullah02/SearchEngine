Furthermore, the elective operating rooms are completely locked down and general management has imposed the cancellation of all vacations for HUG employees (i.e., 11,730 of them). The neurosurgery department with its high-tech platform is maximally concerned by these institutional efforts (i.e., by the closure of its hybrid vascular operating rooms and of its intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance suite).",

Is the remedy applied in some countries and hospitals likely to prove worse than the disease itself? All elective surgical activity has been stopped in many centers affected by the epidemic, as in HUG in Geneva. Even worse, although sometimes necessary, patients are afraid to go to the hospital and cancel their visit. This same observation has also been relayed by the neurosurgical clinics in Bergamo in Italy and other internationally renowned centers around the world. 3, 4, 8, 9 Would it have been a valid alternative to, for example, mount a fully equipped modular COVID-19 center outside the campus of the university medical center, as it is currently done in other cities such as Zagreb or Moscow, to keep free access to the high-quality technical and operating room platform? There are so many speculations around this topic, and we will get answers to those questions long after the current crisis, only when all this has been worked up in detail.",
