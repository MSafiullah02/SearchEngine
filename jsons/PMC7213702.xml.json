The name COVID-19 (acronym for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d) was coined on the 11th of February 2020 to describe presentation with severe acute respiratory disease [2]. COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus belongs to the family of single stranded RNA viruses some of which have been previously described to be responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [3, 4]. Although the symptoms and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS, the rate of spread is greater [5]. As of 25th of March 2020, the total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 stands at 459,419 with 20,818 deaths globally and the number is projected to increase [6].",

COPD is a complex disease associated with abnormalities of the airway and/ or alveoli which is predominantly caused by exposure to noxious gases and particulates over a long period [7]. With a global prevalence of 251 million cases in 2016, and 3.17 million (5%) deaths in 2015 alone, COPD was ranked by the WHO as the third leading cause of death especially with a particular burden in low- and middle-income countries [8, 9]. This burden is predicted to grow due mainly to increased global exposure to tobacco, aging populations, poor awareness and inadequate access to diagnosis [10]. COPD exacerbations are a major event in the natural history of the disease associated with worsening of symptoms often resulting in hospitalization and poor prognosis [11]. Various factors have been described to contribute to acute worsening of COPD, however, viral infection remains the main trigger, including seasonal coronaviruses [12\u201314].",

We provide an updated report in relation to smokers [32]. Our main outcomes show that the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was low, but that the risk of severity (63%) and mortality (60%) were high, which indicates COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19 are at a greater risk of severe complications and death. Furthermore, the prevalence of current smokers in COVID-19 patients was 9% (95% CI, 4%\u201314%), and this was also associated with greater severity (22.30%) and mortality (38.5%).",

Having a reliable estimate of the prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 cases, and likely outcomes, is crucial to ensure specific successful global preventive and treatment strategies for COPD patients. Bearing this in mind, in the included studies there was no report on COPD severity data and COPD-related comorbidities, which prevents us from assessing the impact of such essential information.",

This summary agrees with other results currently available only in pre-print [35, 36]. Viral infections in COPD patients increase systemic inflammation with slow recovery of reported symptoms [37, 38]. In addition to the effects of COVID-19, patients with COPD have various comorbidities, some of which are associated with increased risk of hospitalization [39\u201341]. According to recent systematic reviews, the prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was high and these comorbidities were associated with increased disease severity [42, 43]. Most of the studies that reported COPD severity defined severe cases as those who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), had severe oxygenation, needed mechanical ventilation or death [18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 29]. These studies did not give details about the underlying COPD. It would have been interesting to know if the frequency of previous exacerbations was linked to increased complications in COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In general, those with severe case of COVID-19 were older and had more coexisting comorbidities than those with mild illness.",

This concurs with pre-print studies that found similarly high mortality rates [35, 44\u201347]. Despite the small number of patients that were analyzed, this increases concerns about the prognosis of this vulnerable population. However, this high mortality rate could be attributed to several factors. The majority of COPD patients have various comorbidities that may also be associated with mortality and related conditions may have been underreported because of the difficulties finding the specific cause of mortality [48]. Moreover, in patients with severe COPD, respiratory failure is the principal cause of mortality and this demands ICU intervention. It is possible that limited access to respiratory support as part of COVID-19 management may be contributing to this mortality, dependent on critical care capacity in each hospital or region. According to a recent COVID-19 report from Italy, the surge in patients requiring intensive care has been unmanageable, with 12% of positive cases requiring ICU admission [49], more than that reported in China [18, 28]. As a consequence, patients were dying because mechanical ventilation could not be offered, on top of acute shortage of clinicians who were able to manage those patients [50, 51]. Until now, the particular mechanisms of how COVID-19 increases COPD severity and mortality is unknown, and undoubtedly more research is needed to find the possible mechanisms that linked COVD-19 and increased severity and mortality of COPD patients.",

The overall I2 was 92.49% among the studies, which indicates considerable heterogeneity. However, this was address by using random effect model to incorporate between-study variability of effect sizes. Such heterogeneity is expected due to different study designs, regions and outcomes. Interestingly, we found that 22.30% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications associated and greater mortality reaching 38.5% in current smokers. The calculated RR from two studies showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.03\u20132.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers [18, 29]. The impact of smoking history on vulnerability to COVID-19 has been explored but there is limited data on the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread of and poor outcome in COVID-19. A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking including five studies found that smoking was most likely associated with the negative outcomes. This recommended further research to explore this in more detail due to limited studies [32]. Evidence from other respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, has shown that inhaled tobacco smoke raises the transmission rate and severity of viral respiratory tract infections [53]. It seems there is underlying mechanisms behind this prevalence, as smoking has been related to higher expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) (pre-print) [54]. However, as more reports globally from diverse racial and genetic contexts become available, differences in the production of ACE2 can be further evaluated and linked to how they lead to COVID-19 vulnerability in different groups [55].",

For the first time, we conducted a meta-analysis using a random effects model to calculate the pooled prevalence of COPD in confirmed COVID-19 and examined outcomes. This increased the generalizability of our findings, as heterogeneity was addressed by incorporating between-study variability of effect sizes. We showed that COPD and smoking in COVID-19 is associated with greater disease severity and higher mortality. This review has some limitations. Few studies were eligible for inclusion and most of them come from China. Second, heterogeneity exists in location, setting, and design. The reported clinical characteristics were not available in most of the studies at the time of analyses. This work has a number of clinical and research implications. It highlights the global prevalence and the clinical effects of COVID-19 on COPD patients and smokers. As COPD patients are at an increased risk of severe outcomes if they became infected with COVID-19, it is recommended that patients and clinicians establish effective plans for ensuring prevention, such as using tele-medicine to ensure that COPD receive the best care [56, 57]. We strongly advocate public awareness campaigns concentrating on ways to achieve smoking cessation among smokers, and it is possible that an improvement in cessation rates will help to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms between COPD, smoking and COVID-19 infection.",
