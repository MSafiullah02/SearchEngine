Due to the pandemic, healthcare systems, hospitals and intensive care units are functioning beyond their capacity and the interruption of supply chains have resulted in shortages of equipment (i.e. ventillators), intensive care beds, medications, testing centers and PAPR (Powered Air Purifying Respirators) for healthcare workers. While the current challenges seem to be unprecedented (although it most likely will not eclipse the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918), there are healthcare delivery models that were used in the past and may also serve as a model for the current and future pandemics.",

These \u201ctemporary\u201d hospitals (as they could be moved every month if necessary) were deployed to the frontlines in order to provide lifesaving trauma care to injured soldiers near the battlefield. While many were instrumental in the genesis of these MASH units, Dr. Michael DeBakey helped organize and promote this concept despite initial resistance1. These MASH units ultimately resulted in shorter evacuation times, rapid triage, successful resuscitation of the wounded and a reduction in the number of casualties. These MASH units were known for their mobility and adaptability and individual MASH units provided care for hundreds of patients at a time. These units have been extensively and successfully used in the Korean, Vietnam, Gulf and Iraqi Wars1. The healthcare delivery provided by these units provided numerous medical advances and may serve as a platform for healthcare crises.",

These hospitals have 924,107 staffed beds, 97,776 intensive care beds and collectively have an average occupancy rate of 65% and employs more than 7 million people2. Our U.S. healthcare system functions well but seasonal influenza outbreaks can provide unique challenges and stresses regional bed capacity of hospitals. For example, the 2017-2018 flu season was particularly severe in the U.S. accounting for more than 900,000 hospitalizations and 61,099 deaths2. Any further challenge during the flu season can prove to be a challenge for the healthcare delivery system. COVID-19 has provided such a global challenge with areas of higher intensity seen around the world including: Milan, Venice, New York, California, Louisiana and others.",

A potential solution for this shortage would be to establish mobile ambulatory hospitals that could be staffed for cardiopulmonary support services and could be moved throughout the country to provide the necessary healthcare support. This might utilize units already available through the Department of Defense or in the future be engineered and mobilized by the government for use and deployment. It would also be important to establish a healthcare team composed of nursing staff, technicians and physicians (critical care, pulmonologists, infectious disease specialists, advanced heart failure specialists, etc.) that would be assigned to these mobile, ambulatory hospitals. Such a model would require that the dedicated healthcare team be released from their professional duties in their communities and state licensure allowances would need to be implemented. This special force of healthcare personnel would provide efficient expertise in the treatment of any panepidemic.",
