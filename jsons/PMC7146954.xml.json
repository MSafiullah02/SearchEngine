CE as a neglected zoonotic disease represents an economic and public health problem in many developing countries [1]. The natural life-cycle of E. granulosus typically includes dogs as the definitive hosts and domestic and wild ungulates as the intermediate hosts. The adult worms are localized in dog small intestine, where eggs are excreted with feces to the environment. Upon ingestion of the eggs, hatched oncospheres penetrate the intestinal mucosa and migrate through the blood and lymphatic system to virtually every organ predominantly in the liver and lungs. The parasite develops into a fluid-filled cyst, containing numerous metacestodes known as protoscoleces (PSCs) [2, 3].",

In recent years, RNAi has been used for a number of genes in parasitic helminths, leading to suppression of functional genes in the parasites. Several studies applied dsRNA-based interference technology on different helminth taxa including flatworms [7, 8], nematodes [9\u201311] and turbellarians [12]. Relatively few studies have been conducted on the use of dsRNAs in cestode parasites [13\u201315]. Silencing of the Me-act-1 gene in Moniezia expansa with dsRNA suppressed mRNA expression in the tegument, and resulted in increased tegumental disruption/blebbing and reduced F-actin levels in muscle adult worm [14].",

TSPs are a large superfamily of plasma membrane-bound proteins that are thought to be present in all metazoans.

            "text": "Despite their promise as vaccines, the functions of TSPs have not yet been elucidated. Hu et al. [21] have studied immunolocalization of E. granulosus TSP1 (EgTSP1) in different protoscoleces and adult stages of the parasite. Using EgTSP1-specific siRNA on protoscoleces resulted in thinner tegumental distal cytoplasm. However, Hu et al. [21] provided no data on the strobilated forms of the parasite. Looking into the molecular structure and function of the adult worms (in dogs) could potentially provide us necessary information and tools to combat the disease in human hosts. The potential of RNAi technology to target major structural proteins of tapeworms has been poorly investigated. While the TSPs family has been extensively studied and well characterized in several platyhelminths [20, 29, 30], there are very few data on genomic manipulation of TSPs by RNAi. Suppression of Sm-tsp1 and Sm-tsp2 mRNA in S. mansoni using dsRNA resulted in impairments in tegument integrity, maturation and stability [33]. The present study investigated the potential of dsRNA-mediated EgTSP1 suppression and its molecular and biological consequences in developmental stages of E. granulosus in vitro.",

EgTSP1 silencing in strobilated worms resulted in impaired microtriches and small vacuoles developed in the tegumental cytoplasm after three days. Twenty-one days after dsRNA treatment some ultrastructural changes were noted including the presence of enlarged extensive vacuoles, empty internal cavities and remarkable surface damage in the tegumental cytoplasm (Fig. 3).",

Findings of this study indicated molecular and biological consequences in different developmental stages following dsRNA interference. Platyhelminths express a family of TSP in their tegument and some of the TSP members are candidates of vaccine development against platyhelminth infections [19, 20, 30]. There are currently at least 33 members of the TSP superfamily known in humans or mammals, 20 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 36 in Drosophila melanogaster, 29 in Schistosoma spp. and 30 in E. granulosus [40, 41]. Although the TSP family has been extensively studied and well characterized in parasitic organisms there are very few studies on the TSP functions and its biological properties in helminth parasites. A few studies have used RNAi to suppress a few Echinococcus genes to determine their function. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) gene silencing was achieved in the PSCs and led to the impairment of development in the parasite [15]. In another study, calmodulin expression was suppressed by siRNA treatment in in vitro-cultured E. granulosus and consequently the parasites exhibited morphological and biological changes as well as lowered viability rate [36]. Hu et al. [21] have used EgTSP1-specific siRNA for silencing the gene and specifically reduced the level of EgTSP1 expression by 64% in the PSCs accompanied by pronounced phenotypic changes in the tegument. To understand the role of TSP1, we explored the effects of EgTSP1-specific long dsRNA in different developmental stages of E. granulosus.",

[33] found the highest TSP suppression in the adult worms and schistosomula of S. mansoni at 7 days post-treatment (61% and 75% suppression, respectively). We demonstrated that silencing of EgTSP1 expression affects the viability and evagination of the PSCs (Fig. 1e, f). TSP1 suppression exerted a significant effect on the viability of protoscoleces. In addition, the process of evagination was significantly slowed down after dsRNA treatment, i.e. 74% of irrelevant dsRNA control PSCs were evaginated while evagination was observed in only a quarter of the protoscoleces in the treatment groups. There are no studies relevant to the biological consequences of RNAi-induced TSP1 suppression in platyhelminths; however, several studies have been conducted on other genes including thioredoxin peroxidase, calmodulin, 14-3-3 and elp [13]. For thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), siRNA treatment in the PSCs led to the reduced viability by 79% compared to the untreated control [15]. In another study, it has been shown that the viability of the PSCs was significantly affected by EgCaM-specific siRNA three days post-treatment [36]. The present findings indicate a crucial role for TSP1 gene in developmental biology and differentiation of E. granulosus protoscoleces.",

The tegumental distal cytoplasm of tsp-2-specific dsRNA-treated schistosomula and adult worms of S. mansoni was highly vacuolated and much thinner than that of the luciferase dsRNA control [33]. Our TEM results are in line with those of Hu et al. [21] in which silencing EgTSP1 in the PSCs led to thinner tegument with malformations and vacuolization.",
