            "text": "The latest public data from the Chinese Ministry of Health showed 120,940 confirmed H1N1 cases and 659 deaths were reported from the Chinese mainland as of January 2, 2010. Data analysis suggests that patients with chronic diseases, obese patients, and pregnant women are more liable to develop severe H1N1 influenza. After initial infection by the virus, the host innate immune system, as a first line of defense, takes protective measures earlier than the adaptive immune system to avoid further viral invasion or replication [1]. Animal experiments indicated that when the swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) infected early hosts, it elicited strong CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD25+ T cell reactions [2]. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are related to viral immunity and the lack of these cells would lead to a delay in viral clearance and an increase in mortality [3-5]. On the other hand, CD4+CD25+ cells are T cell subsets with an immune inhibition function and could play an important regulatory role in a variety of infectious diseases [6-8]. These complex molecular and cellular mechanisms are helpful in controlling and eliminating the acute stage of viral infection. Although successfully eliminating the virus is essential, the response of virus-specific T cells to the hosts could also result in tissue damage and autoimmune responses. Therefore, monitoring the variation of cellular immune functions in H1N1 patients have important clinical significance. The aim of this study is to analyze the dynamic fluctuations of T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and regulatory T cells in patients infected with novel influenza H1N1, as well as serum cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP).",

Oseltamivir, given to patients older than 12 years, was prescribed according to the standard dosing regimen (75 mg twice daily orally, for 5 days). Dosage adjustment, whenever necessary, were based on the patient's renal function (75 mg daily, if creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min).

The preliminary data from this study showed that the frequency of CD19+ B cells in patients with severe H1N1 was significantly higher than in the moderate and control groups (Figure 1e), and the frequency of NK cells in the severe and moderate groups were less than that of the control group. In the host innate immune system, NK cells are the major effector cells during acute infection, rapidly killing infected cells in the process. Previous studies have shown that the significant decrease in peripheral NK cell count is mainly because the S-OVI directly infected and killed NK cells, thereby limiting their activity and leading to their apoptosis in vivo [13].",

Currently, the use of flow cytometric analysis to measure peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD25+ T cells is a simple and common method. Reportedly, the mostly CD4+CD25+ T cells were also positive for FoxP3 [14]. In this experiment, the peak values for all lymphocyte subgroups in patients with severe H1N1 could not be detected. At least two mechanisms could account for the lower effector T cell response detected after the S-OVI infection, and the peak response time for the effector T cells possibly missed. In addition, the virus could have also led to the immunotolerance of the T cells [15].",
