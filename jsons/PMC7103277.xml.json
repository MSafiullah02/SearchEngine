            "text": "Inhalation of compounds as a means to treat diseases is used since ancient times. The oldest reports came from China and India around 2000 BC and are related to the inhalation of smoke from burned herbal preparations based on Ephedra sinica or Daturastramonium to treat asthma, respectively [1], [2]. Pedanus Discorides (40\u201390 AD) the Greek physician, surgeon, pharmacologist, botanist and author of De Materia Medica (considered the first pharmacopeia) as well as Aelius Galenus (129\u2013199/217 AD) prescribed inhaled sulfur vapors to their patients [3]. Although the word \u201cinhaler\u201d was used for the first time by the English physician John Mudge in 1778 to describe his invention, the first therapeutic inhalation device is attributed to Hippocrates (460\u2013377 BC) [1], [2]. Through the years, many compounds and mixtures were proposed and used to treat different diseases using various methods for inhalation. From ceramic inhalers, to combustible powders, burning papers and liquid atomizers. Very curious and popular ways to inhale compounds in the 19th and 20th centuries were the asthma cigarettes which were withdrawn from the market in 1992 [1], [3]. The inhalation of vapor from solutions of picric acid, tar, iodine or sulfuric acid was very popular in the 20th century to treat TB and other infections, especially in spas [3]. The first mentions regarding inhalation of antibiotics such as penicillin by nebulization to treat pulmonary infections were published in the 1940s [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Nowadays, inhaled drugs are preferentially administered via dry powder inhalers (DPI) and pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDI), being also used as nebulizers in hospitals.",

It is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide being declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993, a distinction never granted to any other disease. In 2011, there were around 8.7 million incident cases of TB, 1 million deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 0.43 million deaths from HIV-associated TB [29]. The current therapy includes long-term multiple dose oral administration of various drugs, which sometimes leads to low patient compliance and therefore to the development of multidrug-resistant strains referred to as multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). The first-line drugs used in the treatment of standard TB are rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin [30], [31]. At the moment new drugs are in clinical trials [32] constituting a hope for the treatment of resistant forms of the disease. In addition to the development of resistance, the difficulty to treat TB stems from the fact that when administered systemically many anti-TB drugs fail to reach the lungs or penetrate into the alveolar macrophages, the reservoir of M. tuberculosis\n[31], [33]. M. tuberculosis persists in macrophages within a granuloma formed in the lungs of the infected hosts. Thus, traditional drug chemotherapy has serious limitations particularly the drug internalization and cytosolic availability on the infected phagocytic cells [34]. This phenomenon has driven many researchers to develop drug delivery systems (DDS) that improve the treatment of such burden.",

There are a variety of fungal infections such as histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum), sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenkii), blastomycosis (Blastomyces dermatitidis), coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides spp.), paracoccidioidomycosis (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis) cryptococcosis (Cryptococcus spp.), aspergillosis (Aspergillus spp.), candidiasis (Candida spp.), pneumonia (Candida spp. and Pneumocystis spp.) or Trichosporon spp. infection that can cause pulmonary injury with different severities [35]. Actually, there are a variety of anti-fungal drugs available in the market generally administered orally or intravenously. They include amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB), itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin [35]. Among the anti-fungal drugs used to treat fungal infections, AmB is considered the gold standard therapy and it is the most commonly used therapy to treat life-threatening cases. The nephro- and cardiotoxicity of AmB is the major clinical drawback, which could lead to treatment discontinuation [36]. At the moment the marketed formulations of AmB usually used in clinical practice (e.g. AmBisome\u00ae (Gilead Sciences), Fungizone\u00ae (Bristol-Myers Squibb) or Abelcet\u00ae (Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)) are lipid-based DDS that present lower toxicity, while resulting in higher drug therapeutic index. AmB is extensively formulated in various nano-DDS being a proof-of-concept of the usefulness of nanomedicine in the delivery of anti-fungal drugs [37], [38], [39].",

Nevertheless, the influenza virus is the main cause of viral airway infections worldwide related to severe annual epidemics, while the respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus are the most important causes of viral infection of the lower respiratory tract in children. Vaccination is the primary means of preventing and controlling viral infections, especially annual outbreaks of influenza. At the moment, few drugs are available to treat pulmonary viral infections like amantadine (Symmetrel\u00ae, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), rimantadine (Flumadine\u00ae, Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Hoffmann-La Roche) usually used in young, elderly, and other groups of patients with other serious medical conditions. Currently these drugs are administered by the oral route. Only recently, zanamivir formulated in a DPI (Relenza\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline) was approved for the treatment of influenza by the pulmonary route. Unfortunately, there is yet no specific treatment or a vaccine available for the viruses identified recently.",

However, through the years the accumulated overuse and misuse of anti-infectious drugs have led to the development of resistant strains. Microorganisms developed, by genetic mutations or acquisition of resistance genes, defense mechanisms that make them more dangerous and difficult to treat such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death [43], [44]. In addition, intracellular infections are difficult to eradicate due to low availability and activity of anti-infectious drugs inside cells. In order to treat patients with resistant strains, high doses of drugs are used that present adverse effects to healthy tissues and organs.",

For example, nano-DDS can be capitalized to encapsulate drugs and thereby (i) increase their solubility, (ii) protect them from degradation, (iii) enhance their epithelial absorption and increase their blood circulation time, (iv) target the drugs to specific cells/tissues/organs, releasing them in a controlled manner as a response to a specific stimulus, and (v) enhance their uptake by cells [22], [23], [46].

Moreover, it has generated a profuse intellectual property platform. However, and despite the fact that nanomedicine began as a discipline almost half a century ago, only a few nano-DDS have found their way to the market [48]. This phenomenon could be explained by the lack of financial profitability, consumer distrust and the lack of confidence due to poor information/education, ineffective regulation of new and generic products, and weak patent protection [49]. At the moment, regulatory agencies are in process of developing specific guidelines and regulations regarding nanotechnology-based products in order to develop new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of such products [50], [51]. Nonetheless, the relatively few marketed nano-DDS have been successful in their respective therapeutic areas. According to BCC Research, the global nanomedicine market has been growing steadily, reaching a value of $72.8 billion in 2011, with anticancer agents as the market leader and it is expected to increase at an annual growth rate of 12.5% until 2016 reaching $130.9 billion [52].",

Consequently, patient compliance is augmented avoiding the development of multidrug-resistant strains.

The same anatomical and physiological characteristics that can make airways susceptible to infection by external pathogens can be exploited for drug delivery. The respiratory system provides a non-invasive route of delivery with a large surface area, a thin epithelial barrier, extensive blood supply and blood flow, and lower enzymatic activity compared to other organs in the body (e.g., liver and gastrointestinal tract). Also, first-pass metabolism is avoided by pulmonary administration, which is especially useful for drugs that suffer high hepatic metabolism [53], [55]. After inhalation, particles will be transported with the inhaled air through the respiratory tract until they will be deposited or exhaled. Among the features that influence the behavior of inhaled particles in the airways, the mean aerodynamic diameter (Eq. (1)) plays an important role as it governs the particle deposition pattern.(1)dae=deq\u03c1p\u03c1oX.\n",

However, studies in the area of environmental toxicology showed that nanoparticles with sizes ranging between 1 and 100 nm could also randomly deposit to a great extent in the lower airways (Fig. 1\n) [57]. The mechanisms involved in particle deposition also depend on the anatomy of the airway region and they include inertial impaction, sedimentation and diffusion (Fig. 2\n) [58], [59].",

They provide physical, chemical or microbiological stability, bulk properties that improve handling and metering, while controlling the mechanical and pharmaceutical properties of formulations such as release and permeation [56], [60]. At the moment, only a small number of excipients are authorized for pulmonary delivery, but a variety of new excipients is under evaluation. Since lungs have limited buffer capacity, only compounds that are biocompatible or endogenous to the lung and that are easily metabolized or cleared can be used in inhaled formulations [60]. Since formulations for nebulization are liquid solutions or suspensions, the common excipients used are salts (e.g., NaCl) to adjust the osmolarity (300 mosmol/L), HCl, NaOH, phosphates to adjust the pH to neutrality, and surfactants such as polysorbates, sorbitan monostearate, oleic acid and soy lecithin to facilitate the formation of liquid droplets. Ethanol can be used as co-solvent and permeation enhancer only in small concentration due to its irritation potential. Preservatives, antioxidants or chelating agents such as parabens and benzalkonium chloride, ascorbic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) can also be used to enhance stability [56]. The excipients used in pMDI are similar to those found in preparations for nebulization except for the gas propellants. The most widely excipient used as propellant in pMDI is hydrofluoroalkane, a non-toxic, non-flammable, and chemically stable gas without carcinogenic or mutagenic effects. Due to the absence of ozone-depleting properties, hydrofluoroalkane has been replacing chlorofluorocarbon-based propellants [61]. DPI were developed as a response to the limitations regarding stability and environmental aspects of pMDI and nebulizers [60]. Being solid dispersions of drugs blended with a coarse carrier particle, the efficacy of a DPI depends on powder technology and particle engineering. In DPI, the coarse carrier particle is the major component of the formulation (> 95%, w/w). It provides bulk properties and reduces the cohesion forces between drug particles, facilitating the aerosol dispersion and defining deposition pattern [62]. Lactose is the main excipient used as coarse and larger carrier particles and, to a lower extent, as cryoprotectant when particles are prepared using lyophilization. A variety of inhalation grade lactoses with a narrow particle size distribution like Lactohale 100\u00ae, Inhalac 230\u00ae or Respitose ML001\u00ae are commercially available. Other sugars such as glucose, trehalose and mannitol are also used as cryoprotectants and coarse carriers [56]. Magnesium stearate is approved for inhalation to protect the drug from moisture and to reduce cohesion and adhesion between particles [63].",

            "text": "Regarding inhaled nano-DDS, most of the components are generally not approved for inhalation. In this case, new excipients proposed for inhalatory formulations need to pass through the entire process of safety evaluation, including complete in vitro toxicological evaluation and in vivo assessment of non-clinical and clinical safety prior to licensing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of specific regulatory guidance regarding the toxicological assessment of excipients for inhalation [64], [65], [66]. Excipients generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or those approved for other routes of administration need a more limited number of experiments for safety evaluation, their acceptance by regulatory agencies being usually easier. This is the case of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a lipid surfactant and one of the constituents of lung surfactant that is commonly used in the production of liposomes. Studies show that PC-based liposomes do not affect or slightly decrease the viability of human A549 alveolar cells after 24 h of exposure. The effects on cell viability are dependent on the PC derivate and the concentration used [67]. Other compounds used in the development of nano-DDS such as dextran, alginate, carrageenan or gelatin also possess GRAS status. It should be mentioned that that regulations apply not only to the material itself but also to its source. Thus, chitosan obtained from Aspergillus niger is in the process to obtain GRAS status. Chitosan does not present significant toxicity to pulmonary tissue and cells after inhalation [68], [69]. In fact, some studies showed some protective effect against oxidative stress [68]. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) is another biodegradable polymer extensively used in the production of nano-DDS. The cytotoxicity of PLGA nanoparticles with different coatings and surface charges was assessed. Results showed that the cytotoxicity to human bronchial Calu-3 cells was very limited, with the absence of inflammatory response [70]. Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been tested as complexing agents and excipients of inhalatory formulations. Various approved formulations containing CDs such as Voltaren\u00ae (Novartis), Clorocil\u00ae (Laborat\u00f3rio Edol), Brexin\u00ae (Chiesi Farmaceutici) or Vfend\u00ae (Pfizer), are used daily in the clinical practice for administration routes other than inhalation [71].",

There are numerous devices available with distinct properties and specifications that are more appropriate than others for each type of formulation (Fig. 3\n). Since the device greatly influences the particle aerosolization and deposition pattern, the choice of the appropriate device for a specific formulation is one of the most time-consuming and challenging stages of the development phase and it is imperative to ensure the drug efficacy [62], [74]. For example, Alexander et al. tested the aerosolization efficacy of Ambisome\u00ae (Gilead Sciences) using different nebulizers and they found differences among all of them [75]. The inhaler device needs to be accurate, small, easy to handle, discreet, and user friendly in order to be accepted by both clinicians and patients. One of the claimed reasons for the market failure of Exubera\u00ae (Pfizer) was low patient compliance partly due to the complex inhaler device [76]. Owing to the great therapeutic potential of this alternative administration route, the last decades witnessed the development of devices with greater pulmonary deposition fractions of approximately 40\u201350% of the nominal dose as compared with the low levels between 10 and 15% verified in the past [61].",

For example, power-assisted devices activated by vibration [77], [78] or pneumatic technology [79], called active inhalers, have been developed for the delivery of systemically active drugs that have narrow therapeutic windows and for inhalatory nano-DDS [60]. Also, the development of adjusted inhalers that present specific inhalation patterns that are useful for the treatment of certain pulmonary diseases can be given attention [61]. It is also important to consider the cost of the device and its impact on the final product price. A balanced price/therapeutic efficacy relationship is a crucial factor that can limit the clinical application of a certain product.",

            "text": "Due to its low water solubility, rifampicin is the focus of studies regarding encapsulation into different nanocarriers. Poly(ethylene oxide)-b-distearoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (mPEG\u2013DSPE) micelles were proposed as carriers for rifampicin, although their therapeutic efficacy was not assessed [94]. Rifampicin was entrapped with high encapsulation efficiency into these micelles that sustained its release over 3 days in vitro. Formulations presented a fraction of fine particles of approximately 40% after nebulization [94], an acceptable value that can be increased through system optimization. In another study, liposomal DPIs were developed and assessed as a platform for rifampicin inhalation [95]. The cryoprotectant used during the freeze-drying process influenced the aerosolization properties of the formulations. Between trehalose, mannitol and lactose, mannitol presented the best results regarding fine particle fraction and mean aerodynamic diameter [95]. The coating of the liposomes with muco-adhesive polymers such as chitosan improved the encapsulation efficiency of rifampicin but it distinctly affected the nebulization properties of the formulations as well as their cytotoxicity, that were intimately associated with the composition [96]. Nevertheless, the fine tuning of the liposome composition and considering that the muco-adhesiveness of the systems was enhanced [96], it was expected that the lung accumulation of rifampicin, and thus its therapeutic effect, would be increased, making this a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic index of inhaled rifampicin. Aiming to avoid the administration of multiple medicines on a daily basis, Zahoor et al. developed alginate-chitosan NPs loaded simultaneously with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide [97]. Around 80% of the nebulized formulation presented a mean aerodynamic diameter of 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcm, suitable for inhalation. Biodistribution studies performed in guinea pigs showed the presence of the drugs in plasma for a period exceeding 10 days, the drugs being detected in the lungs, liver and spleen in concentrations that were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for up to 15 days (Fig. 5\n). In contrast, free drugs administered by the same route were cleared after 24 h. In addition, inhalation of nanoparticles in a regimen of one administration every 15 days for 45 days (3 administrations) presented the same localized and systemic therapeutic activity against M. tuberculosis in an animal model of the infection as the combination of the free drugs administered p.o. daily for 45 days (Table 2\n). Furthermore, there was no evidence of any biochemical hepatotoxicity [97]. Similar results were obtained by the same group using SLNs [98], PLGA [99] and wheat germ agglutinin-PLGA [100] nanoparticles containing rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, though these formulations required higher plasma residence time and different dose regimens. The existence of receptors for lectins in the alveolar epithelium could potentiate the absorption of drugs encapsulated into lectin-functionalized nanoparticles [100]. These modified systems emerge as a promising approach because they would allow the reduction of the dosing frequency and, by doing so, the improvement of patient compliance. At the same time, the cost\u2013benefit balance should be thoroughly assessed for each one of them to ensure patient affordability. Other nano-DDS loaded with kanamycin [101], isoniazid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, rifampicin or ethionamide [67], [93] have been developed. However, their aerosolization properties and therapeutic efficacy in TB were not assessed.",

The encapsulation of antibacterial drugs and their pulmonary administration improve their therapeutic index and leads to the reduction of the dose required to reach the local MIC. A liposomal DPI of ciprofloxacin presenting a mean aerodynamic diameter of 2.8 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm and 60% of fine particle fraction appeared as a possible formulation for the treatment of respiratory infections by the inhalatory route. Similar results were obtained by Desai et al. using liposomes loaded with ciprofloxacin and CM3, a peptide with antimicrobial properties [102]. In another study, inhaled ciprofloxacin/liposomes provided protection against a lethal pulmonary tularemia murine model. Unlike untreated (control) and free inhaled ciprofloxacin treated mice, one single dose of the liposomal formulation resulted in at least 86% of survival after 14 days [103]. Inhaled liposomal tobramycin was therapeutically more effective than the conventional inhalatory formulation (Tobi\u00ae, PathoGenesis Canada Ltee) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a multiple dose treatment conducted in infected rats [104]. These findings were explained by differences in the pulmonary pharmacokinetic profile of the different formulations. Liposomes display a greater area under curve (3890 \u00b1 560 \u03bcg h/lungs) and elimination half-life time (34.4 \u00b1 5.0 h) with respect to the conventional formulation (663 \u00b1 89 \u03bcg h/lungs and 14.0 \u00b1 4.0 h) [104]. Similar results were obtained in the treatment of rats infected with Burkholderia cepacia using the same formulation [105]. In another study, inhaled liposomal polymyxin B presented higher pulmonary levels of the drug (42.6 \u00b1 6.2 \u03bcg/paired lungs) compared to the free drug (8.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcg/paired lungs) and reduced the lung injuries resulting from P. aeruginosa infection in rats [106]. The same formulation was shown to possess lower MIC values for various Gram-negative bacteria including resistant strains of P. aeruginosa\n[107]. Also, a silver\u2013carbene complex with antimicrobial properties was encapsulated in l-tyrosine polyphosphate nanoparticles and nebulized to mice infected with P. aeruginosa. The treatment reduced the number of bacteria in lungs and spleen and increased the survival of the animals [108].",

AmB-loaded micelles presented the same antifungal activity of Fungioze\u00ae but lower toxicity. The formulations were efficiently nebulized using an air-jet nebulizer presenting up to 52% of fine particle fraction [38]. Also, in the treatment of fungal infections, itraconazole:polysorbate 80:poloxamer 407 nanostructured aggregates administered by inhalation to mice presented higher lung concentrations, lung-to-serum ratios, improved survival of infected animals and lower toxicity than orally administered itraconazole formulations, in a 12 day study [109], [110], [111], [112]. No signs of lung inflammation or changes in pulmonary histology were detected [113]. It is worth stressing that a lower drug dose was required to achieve lung and serum therapeutic levels using inhaled formulation compared to oral administration [110]. Itraconazole nanostructured aggregates composed of mannitol and lecithin prepared by an ultra-rapid freezing technique also presented promising features such as aerosolization suitable for deep lung delivery, high lung deposition and systemic absorption, making them a promising approach to treat invasive fungal infections [114]. Other studies assessing the encapsulation of newer antifungal agents, e.g., voriconazole-sulfoalkyl ether/CD complexes to treat pulmonary fungal infections by inhalation were patented [115]. Nebulization of complexes produces a fine particle fraction of about 70% of the nebulized droplets [115]. Apart from the enhanced aqueous solubility of voriconazole, the formulation led to a pronounced increase of the accumulation in lungs and to a more limited clearance from plasma, these phenomena increase its therapeutic efficacy in Aspergillus fumigatus-infected animals; greater survival extents and reduced lung damage were observed. CDs are proposed not only as the carrier in nano-DDS but also as therapeutic agent in the treatment pulmonary infections. Due to its structure, the Per-6-[(N\u03b1-Boc-l-ornithinyl)amino]-\u03b2-cyclodextrin displayed the capacity to bind to \u03b1-hemolysin. In addition to the in vitro results that showed the prevention of alpha-hemolysin-induced lysis of human alveolar epithelial cells, this CD prevented the mortality in a S. aureus pneumonia murine model [116]. However, the compound was administered intravenously, being necessary to perform pulmonary administration to determine its feasibility as an inhalatory therapeutic agent.",

            "text": "Being a first-line defense mechanism against microorganisms entering the lung via the airways and, consequently, reservoirs of many pathogens, alveolar macrophages have drawn special attention as a relevant clinical target. Various nano-DDS of different drugs have been developed to selectively deliver the therapeutic cargo to alveolar macrophages, presenting positive results in the treatment of both fungal and bacterial infections [34], [37], [117]. The targeting of drugs to macrophages could be achieved by tailoring physicochemical properties of the carriers like size, hydrophilicity, composition, surface charge and surface ligands [118]. Different ligands such as galactomannan, maleylated bovine serum albumin (MBSA), O-steroyl amylopectin (O-SAP), O-palmitoylmannan (OPM), p-aminophenyl-mannopyranoside (PAM), and O-palmitoylpullulan (OPP) were used to promote the targeting and uptake of particles by macrophages via receptor-mediated endocytosis using for example mannose receptors and other lectin-like receptors [37], [117], [119]. In this context, Vyas and Khatri published an interesting review regarding the use of liposomes as delivery systems to alveolar macrophages [120]. Poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene-glycol)-b-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) micelles and chitosan nanoparticles functionalized with hydrolyzed galactomannan were taken up by murine macrophages and promoted increased intracellular levels of rifampicin to a higher extent than non-functionalized particles [121]. Rifampicin-loaded liposomes produced as pressurized formulations were efficiently aerosolized and deposited in the lower airways. The encapsulation of rifampicin led to a reduction of the Mycobacterium smegmatis viability inside macrophages from 45.7 \u00b1 4.7% to 21.6 \u00b1 3.1% for the free drug and phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:dicetylphosphate (PC:Chol:DCP) liposomes, respectively (Fig. 6\n). This effect was further increased by anchoring MBSA (10.9 \u00b1 2.1%) and O-SAP (7.1 \u00b1 1.6%) to the surface of the liposomes [117]. Authors speculated that the ideal 0% of viability could be reached by a repeated dosing regimen. Being taken up by macrophages, ligand-modified liposomes accumulated in the lungs for more prolonged time and they were cleared more slowly through the blood stream (as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies in Wistar rats), exerting their effect locally and more efficiently [117]. This approach appears to be a feasible strategy for the treatment of pulmonary TB.",

Most importantly, in vitro studies showed that liposomes enhanced the uptake of rifampicin by alveolar macrophages and inhibited the growth of intracellular Mycobacterium avium even when a lower dose of rifampicin was used [122].

Additionally, after administration to rats, liposomes accumulated more effectively in the lungs and prolonged the release with respect to the free drug.
