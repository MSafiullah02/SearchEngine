Previous studies identified viral factors that target key players in the signaling pathways responsible for activating the type I interferon (IFN) response, as well as viral factors that target the downstream signaling pathways needed to amplify IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that induce an antiviral state (1, 2). For pathogens that replicate in respiratory or gut epithelial cells, the type III IFN response mediated by IFN lambda (IFN-\u03bb) represents the first line of defense that must be mitigated (3\u20135). Identifying viral antagonists and investigating how these viral factors interrupt or delay innate responses is important for controlling viral pathogenesis and developing new targets for therapeutics and new designs for live-attenuated vaccines.",

CoVs primarily infect lung and gut epithelial cells, resulting in respiratory and enteric diseases, respectively. CoVs are also notorious for their ability to delay the innate immune response to infection, which can contribute to disease severity and potentially contribute to persistence (8). As CoVs have tropism for primary epithelial cells, these viruses must be equipped with strategies to abate the innate response generated in the epithelium. Epithelial cells, unlike myeloid immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, generate and respond to type III IFNs (9, 10). However, how CoVs modulate the type III IFN-mediated antiviral defense in the primary epithelium is not clear.",

            "text": "CoVs belong to the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales and have four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. These viruses have the longest known RNA genomes (\u223c30 kb) (Fig. 1A), which encode 15 to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 through nsp16), four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]), and a variety of strain-specific accessory proteins. Many betacoronavirus (beta-CoV) accessory proteins and several nsps have been identified as IFN antagonists (11). Recently, we and others added a new member to the list of CoV IFN antagonists, nsp15/EndoU (12\u201314). Coronavirus nsp15 was identified as an endoribonuclease (15, 16), but it is now clear that endoribonuclease activity is not required for viral RNA synthesis, since viruses with mutations in the catalytic sites required for EndoU activity replicate efficiently in IFN-deficient cells (12, 13, 17). However, EndoU activity plays a pivotal role in evading host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Inactivating EndoU catalytic activity resulted in robust and early induction of type I IFN in virus-infected mouse macrophages, rapid clearance of infectious virus from the liver and spleen in infected mice, and the generation of a protective immune response. Since nsp15/EndoU is highly conserved across all CoVs (Fig. 1B), we sought to determine if the IFN antagonism we detected in murine CoV is conserved in other CoVs, especially those that target epithelial cells. In the present study, we sought to characterize the role of EndoU of an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).",

Despite early efforts to provide protection with killed or subunit vaccines, there is not yet an effective modified live vaccine (21, 22). PEDV is an alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV) that infects the enteric tract of swine and causes diarrhea (19, 23). This virus is highly pathogenic in neonatal pigs (up to 100% mortality), and the mortality inversely correlates with the age of the animal. PEDV infection occurs primarily in intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes), but it can also be detected in the macrophage-like cells located within Peyer\u2019s patches (24\u201326). Since epithelial cells primarily make and respond to type III IFN, while macrophages primarily respond to type I IFN, we asked if a CoV IFN antagonist can modulate both of these activities. Here, we report that the EndoU activity of PEDV not only antagonized the type I IFN response in porcine macrophages but also inhibited the type III IFN response in porcine epithelial cells, which may facilitate replication, shedding, and disease in piglets.",

The promoter sequence of T7 RNA polymerase and a poly(A) tail were inserted at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome, respectively. In addition, the sequence of the N gene was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector that carries a T7 promoter sequence. To rescue the virus, the five PEDV DNA fragments were digested from their vectors and ligated in vitro. The ligated DNA and linearized N gene plasmid DNA were used as the templates for in vitro RNA transcription reactions to yield full-length genomic RNA and N gene transcripts. These RNA transcripts were mixed and coelectroporated into Vero cells, where they were translated into viral proteins to initiate the replication and assembly of infectious particles of PEDV. Initially, no syncytia-like cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in the electroporated cells, nor were CPE detected upon passage of the supernatant from the electroporated cells. However, using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we detected viral leader-containing subgenomic mRNA from the total RNA isolated from electroporated cells, indicating that virus replication was occurring (data not shown). Similar results were reported during the generation of the infectious clone of PEDV-PC22A, with no CPE detected in cell culture but with clear evidence of virus production, since supernatant could be used to induce disease in piglets (29). For PEDV-PC22A, Hou et al. found that insertion of a trinucleotide into the spike sequence, resulting in replacement of aspartic acid by a glycine residue, and the addition of a histidine residue (D466GH), resulted in development of CPE during PEDV infection in Vero cells (30). Since the Colorado and PC22A strains share 99% identity in the spike region, we reasoned that introducing the D466GH mutation into the spike sequence of the Colorado strain spike sequence would induce CPE in Vero cells. As expected, within 24 to 48 h postelectroporation, syncytia-like CPE was detected in Vero cells electroporated with the in vitro synthesized RNA (Fig. 2A). The virus recovered from the supernatant was designated infectious clone wild type, icPEDV-wt. Similarly, we generated an EndoU-deficient mutant, designated icPEDV-EnUmt, by introducing a His-to-Ala substitution (H226A) of the catalytic residue of nsp15 (Fig. 1). These viruses were passaged in Vero cells, and the expression of N protein was detected by immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-N monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B). The genome sequence of each virus was confirmed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from virus particles. The consensus sequence was found to have no additional mutations other than those described above.",

To determine if this cell line can sense and respond to dsRNA, we transfected these cells with a dsRNA mimic, poly(I:C). We detected significant transcriptional expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb3 mRNA (Fig. 3A) and ISGs (Fig. 3B) at 16 h posttransfection, compared to that in mock-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that PK1 cells are capable of detecting and responding to cytoplasmic dsRNA molecules. Next, we evaluated the kinetics of IFN activation after infection with icPEDV-wt or icPEDV-EnUmt. PK1 cells were mock-infected or infected with the indicated virus at a dose of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) per cell. The mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb3, the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene, and the porcine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at different hours postinfection (hpi) (8, 12, 24, and 32 hpi). We found that in icPEDV-wt-infected cells, the relative mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb3 was not significantly changed at the tested time points, and the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was detected at a low level until late time points of infection (24 and 32 hpi). In contrast, icPEDV-EnUmt infection activated an earlier and more robust IFN response, as revealed by elevated levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA as early as 8 hpi, and IFN-\u03bb3 at 24 hpi (Fig. 3C and D). We also evaluated viral replication by monitoring levels of PEDV N gene mRNA and production of progeny virus. The N gene mRNA expression in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected cells was significantly reduced at late times postinfection (24 and 32 hpi) (Fig. 3E).

We also detected elevated levels of IFN-\u03b1 mRNA (Fig. 5B) in cells infected with the icPEDV-EnUmt compared to the levels seen in icPEDV-wt-infected cells. The IFN-\u03bb3 mRNA level was slightly elevated (2-fold) at 24 hpi in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected cells, but there was no statistically significant difference between wild-type (WT)-infected and EndoU mutant-infected PAMs (Fig. 5C). We note that both WT- and EnUmt-infected PAMs exhibited minimal elevation (2-fold) of N gene expression at 24 hpi (Fig. 5D), consistent with very low levels of virus replication in cultured PAMs (33). We also found that mRNA levels of ISG54 and OAS1 were significantly increased in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected PAMs compared to those in icPEDV-wt-infected PAMs (Fig. 5E and F).

We found that all virus-inoculated piglets manifested with diarrhea and exhibited similar clinical symptoms during the 7-day experimental course, with the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets exhibiting slightly reduced clinical scores at days 3 to 5 (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, although icPEDV-EnUmt-inoculated piglets exhibited a similar disease progression as the WT-infected animals, we found that the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets had significantly reduced viral shedding on days 3 and 6, and trended toward reduced shedding at all time points tested (Fig. 6B). Importantly, there was no mortality in the icPEDV-EnUmt infected piglets, compared to 50% (4/8) and 62.5% (5/8) mortality in the icPEDV-wt and PEDV-Colorado parental strain infected piglets, respectively (Fig. 6C). We performed histopathologic examination of sections of the small intestine in six pigs from the PEDV parental strain-infected group, seven pigs from the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected group and six pigs from the icPEDV-wt-infected group. Lesions consisted of villus atrophy and fusion and accumulation of inflammatory cells within the lamina propria, primarily lymphocytes and plasma cells, and crypt hyperplasia. Mucosal epithelium in affected sections of intestine was cuboidal to tall columnar, and there was mild exocytosis of inflammatory cells. Lesions were present in one or more intestinal sections from all affected pigs and were most pronounced within sections of jejunum and ileum. We report that lesion severity was not significantly different in affected pigs among the three virus-infected groups; however, individual variation was observed in all groups. Representative images of ileum sections from an age-matched, uninfected piglet and from one piglet per virus-infected group are shown in Fig. 7, upper panel. To determine if the sites of virus replication were similar in all infected animals, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect PEDV nucleocapsid protein. Similarly to previous studies (24\u201326), viral antigen was detected in epithelial cells, and we found that the sites of replication of the engineered viruses were essentially identical to those found with PEDV-Colorado (Fig. 7, lower panel).",

By constructing an infectious clone of the virulent Colorado strain of PEDV and an isogenic strain with a mutation that inactivated EndoU activity, we could directly compare the replication kinetics and innate immune responses of these two viruses in cell culture and in animals. Consistent with previous studies of murine coronavirus (12, 13), we found that both wild-type and the EndoU-mutant PEDV replicate efficiently in interferon deficient Vero cells. However, the loss of EndoU activity correlated with activation of type I (IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) IFN responses in macrophages and epithelial cells, and reduced viral titer in PK1 cells. These results are also in line with those of previous reports indicating that replication of SARS-CoV is enhanced in mice lacking the IFN-\u03bb receptor (34, 35) and that PEDV replication can be inhibited by treatment of IFN-\u03bb in epithelial cells (36, 37). Overall, these studies illustrate the critical role of IFNs in controlling enteric pathogens and show that coronaviruses have evolved mechanisms to evade these host innate immune defenses.",

It is important to note that infection with wild-type PEDV does elicit IFN responses from epithelial cells and macrophages, but the timing of the IFN response is delayed and the magnitude of IFN levels is lower than that in PEDV-EndoU mutant virus infection (Fig. 3). The earlier IFN response elicited by icPEDV-EnUmt infection results in the transcription of a series of ISGs that are known to induce an antiviral state and thereby limit propagation of the invading pathogen. We also report detection of reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets infected with icPEDV-EnUmt compared to that in piglets infected with the isogenic wild-type strain (Fig. 6B and C). These results suggest that activation of an early innate immune response alters virus replication and pathogenesis, but additional in vivo research is needed to fully investigate this issue. For example, the in vivo response to CoV infection may differ, depending on the dose of the virus and the age of the animal. It will also be important to evaluate the frequency of reversion of EndoU mutants and to employ strategies to make these viruses recombination resistant (38). It is possible that the pathology we detected at day 7 in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals could be generated by revertant viruses (Fig. 7). Future studies using viruses containing multiple mutations in EndoU, which are thus less likely to revert, should be evaluated at multiple time points to determine the extent of virus replication and the local immune response. For coronaviruses that encode multiple IFN antagonists, it will be interesting to evaluate the role of each antagonist on the type I and type III IFN responses and to determine if inactivating a constellation of antagonists, perhaps both the highly conserved nonstructural protein antagonists and accessory proteins, may be necessary to fully attenuate endemic and emerging strains (29, 39, 40).",

            "text": "Evaluating type III IFN responses in epithelial cells is particularly important for hepatotropic, respiratory, and enterotropic viruses. Previous studies revealed cell type specific differences in the innate immune response and the key role of peroxisomes in activating IFN-\u03bb in response to viral infection. Viral infection recognized by RIG-I/MDA-5 can signal via mitochondrion-associated mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and transcription of IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2, or alternatively through peroxisome-associated MAVS to activate IRF-1, resulting in activation of IFN-\u03bbs (41). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) activates both type I and type III IFN responses (42), but polymorphisms in the IFN-\u03bb gene loci correlate with HCV disease progression and response to treatment (43). This genetic association for controlling HCV replication underscores the importance of the type III IFN response during infection. Similarly, a recent study demonstrates that the IFN-\u03bb response to influenza virus infection provides a \u201cfront line\u201d response in the respiratory epithelium to low-dose infection, which facilitates clearance without activation of the type I IFN response (44). Galani and coauthors provide evidence that limiting the viral infection via the type III IFN response mitigates the role of the more proinflammatory type I IFN response, which can be associated with immunopathology. Enterocyte-tropic viruses, such as rotavirus, reovirus, and norovirus, can be limited by type III IFN responses (45\u201347). Furthermore, IFN-\u03bb receptor knockout mice (Ifnlr1\u2212/\u2212) are highly susceptible to these enteric pathogens. Like coronaviruses, some of these viruses encode IFN antagonists to escape the control of the type III IFN response in the gut.",

The EndoU crystal structures of SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus, and MERS-CoV have been solved, clearly placing it into a conserved family of endoribonucleases, and mutagenesis studies have validated the role of the conserved histidine residues as essential for catalytic activity (48\u201350). The nsp15/EndoU protein was shown to localize with other nonstructural proteins and viral RNA in the double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are thought to protect the viral RNA from recognition by pattern recognition receptors (51\u201353). Initial reports indicated that EndoU activity was essential for coronavirus replication (16); however, more recent research, including this study of PEDV EndoU, indicate that is not essential for viral replication. Rather, EndoU activity is important for antagonism of the innate immune response in macrophages (12, 13) and, as shown here, in epithelial cells. Our studies using a murine coronavirus indicate that viral dsRNA is detected outside the protection of DMVs in EndoU mutant virus-infected cells, suggested that EndoU activity may play a role in either sequestering or cleaving dsRNA to prevent recognition by host dsRNA sensors such as MDA-5 (13). Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of CoV EndoU activity in limiting the sensing of viral dsRNA.",

Mutagenesis studies of the arterivirus EndoU revealed pleiotropic effects on replication; however, these mutant viruses were evaluated in BHK-21 cells, which are defective in IFN production (54, 55). Further studies are needed to determine if arterivirus EndoU activity is important for antagonizing type I and type III IFN responses. Regarding SADS-CoV, this virus recently emerged from bats into the swine population in China, causing fatal disease in over 23,000 piglets on four farms (56\u201358). There are no vaccines currently available to protect from this infection. Identifying the key virulence factors for this emerging virus is essential for designing effective live-attenuated virus vaccines.",

            "text": "A previously published approach for generation of a CoV reverse genetics system (27) was used to assemble a full-length PEDV cDNA clone. Briefly, the genomic sequence of the Colorado strain was divided into five fragments (PEDV-A to PEDV-E) flanked with unique class II restriction sites that leave nonpalindromic overhangs. These fragments were obtained by PCR amplification from three large synthetic DNAs (GenScript) based on the genomic sequence of the fourth passage of PEDV-Colorado strain in Vero cells and sequenced by the Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. In the PEDV-A fragment, a promoter sequence of T7 RNA polymerase was added upstream from the sequence of the PEDV 5\u2032 untranscribed region (UTR). In the E fragment, two synonymous mutations (A23309G and A23312G) were introduced to disrupt a stretch of six A nucleotides, which might interfere with in vitro RNA transcription reactions. Additionally, three nucleotides (GGC) were inserted into the E fragment at nucleotide site 22030 of the PEDV genome. This insertion resulted in a replacement of aspartate 466 residue with a glycine and a histidine (D466GH) in the spike protein, which was shown to facilitate the cell adaptation of PEDV and recovery of infectious clone virus (30). The E fragment also contains a poly(A) tail (23 As) at the end of the viral genomic sequence. All five fragments were cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector, amplified in TOP10 bacterial cells, and verified by Sanger sequencing. A large quantity of each PEDV fragment was obtained by digesting the recombinant plasmid DNA using restriction sites designated in Fig. 1, separating the DNA fragments on a 1% low-melt agarose gel (catalog no. 50111; Lonza), excising the DNA fragment from the gel, and purifying the DNA fragment using a Wizard SV gel extraction kit (catalog no. A9282; Promega). All five PEDV fragments were mixed and ligated overnight at 16\u00b0C using T4 DNA ligase (catalog no. M0202L; New England Biolabs). Ligated fragments were extracted with phenol-chloroform and used as a template for in vitro T7 RNA transcription as instructed in the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (catalog no. AM1344, Life Technologies). In addition, the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector containing a T7 promoter sequence. N gene transcripts were generated from the digested N gene fragment using recommended conditions (mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit). Viral RNA and N gene transcripts were mixed with 800 \u03bcl of Vero cells (1 \u00d7 107 cells/ml) in Opti-MEM (catalog no. 11058021; Gibco) and then added to an electroporation cuvette. Three pulses of 450 V at 50 \u03bcF were used to electroporate RNA into cells with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). The cells were recovered in the cuvette for 10 min at room temperature and then were cultured in a 75-cm2 flask in growth medium at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The growth medium was replaced with FCS-free maintenance medium containing 2 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin 16 h postelectroporation. Cells were maintained until over 90% of the cell monolayer showed syncytia-like CPE, and then the supernatant was harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To generate an EndoU-deficient PEDV, two nucleotides were mutated (C19390G and A19391C) in fragment D to produce a histidine-to-alanine substitution in nsp15. The mutated D fragment was combined with the other fragments for generation of an EndoU-deficient PEDV. Aliquots of both recombinant viral stocks were sent to the Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for full genome sequencing. Except for the mutations described previously, no additional changes were detected.",
