            "text": "As the novel coronavirus threatens the health of Americans and the US economy, cash transfers have received broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate as one method to address the severe financial distress brought on by the pandemic (Grisales, Snell, & Davis, 2020). In March 2020, members of the Republican and Democratic parties introduced cash transfers as part of a coronavirus stimulus package, illustrating that the concept of cash transfers and guaranteed income (GI) programs have moved out of the research space and into the policy conversation (Grunwald, 2020). Nonetheless, to date, neither the proposed stimulus package nor other GI policy proposals discuss how these influxes of cash will or will not interact with means tested benefits and income thresholds, leaving some households at risk of preserving their financial stability at the expense of their access to health insurance and other benefits (Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, 2019) (Stockton Economyic ic). In the midst of an unprecedented crisis and a surge of GI experiments, the field of public health and allied disciplines are ideally situated to lead the policy community in developing models that assist policy makers in ensuring that cash transfer interventions and GI experiments preserve benefits rather than produce new forms of inequality. This paper uses the ethical framework and loss mitigation strategies employed by the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) as a pilot and policy proof of concept to demonstrate how the new wave of cash transfer policies and GI experiments can preserve existing health insurance and other benefits.",

Given the rise of the gig economy, unemployment risks posed by automation, and the fluctuating nature of waged labor, income volatility\u2014an annual income fluctuation of 25% or more already impacting nearly half of the US population (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2017)\u2014is likely to continue influencing health outcomes, highlighting the inextricable link between public health and economic stability (Standing, 2011). In a call to the public health community, Sanjay Basu (2017) identified rising income volatility as a leading preventable threat to public health. GI may be one component of a larger economic justice structure that could smooth this volatility, and the onus for implementation of ethical and just GI models rests on public health and allied disciplines.",

Throughout 2019 and early 2020, Andrew Yang popularized a \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d, providing every American citizen with a $1000 cash transfer in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination that would make existing welfare and social program beneficiaries choose between the cash transfer and benefits (Friends of Andrew Yang, 2019), leading to a renewed public debate on whether Yang's proposal could lead to more, rather than less, inequality by depriving low-income Americans of targeted support (Jarvis, 2019). While most GI experiments operate within the existing benefits structure, little is known about how cash transfers may interact with the social safety net in the US. As demonstrated through the debate around Yang's proposal and concerns around the coronavirus stimulus package (Okun, 2020), it is difficult to anticipate the impact and related ethical concerns of unconditional cash transfer programs on benefit recipients.",

However, there is no clear way to understand this risk as social safety net programs vary significantly on eligibility requirements, income calculations, and corresponding benefits. While some are open-ended entitlements available to all who qualify, others are limited, in part, to program funding or location (US Government Accountability Office, 2017). As a result, decision-making among low-income welfare recipients involves weighing short-term and long-term costs and benefits within these constraints and the availability of other formal and informal resources (Edin & Lein, 1997; Roll & East, 2014; Zippay, 2002). In particular, social supports provided by informal networks, through both direct (e.g., financial contributions) and indirect (e.g., child care) mechanisms, are used by low-income families to \u201chelp alleviate the stress of the cliff effect, with tangible resources and reduced isolation\u201d (Roll & East, 2014, p. 185).",

Since street-level bureaucrats are those operationalizing policy on a micro-level, they are typically the first ones to interpret and apply emerging policy during the implementation phase of a new program or intervention (Tummers, Bekkers, Vink, & Musheno, 2015). The legal and ethical gap created when introducing new policies or interventions sharply departing from legacy bureaucratic structures can generate tension and uneven programming during implementation, particularly when workers feel caught between competing auspices and codes of ethics (Keiser, 2010).",

At present, the public discourse around GI reflects three options: (1) the federal coronavirus cash transfer program which would provide American tax filers earning less than $75,000 ($150,000 joint return) a single payment of $1200 per individual ($2400 joint return) and $500 per qualifying dependent, but does not specify how or if this transfer would impact eligibility for existing means tested benefits (Jamerson, Duehren, & Andrews, 2020); (2) proposals which seek to replace existing means tested benefits with a basic GI for all Americans; and (3) the Stockton Plan, described here, which seeks to provide GI alongside existing means tested benefits.",

Friedman's proposal was intended to be tested in the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment (SIME/DIME), one of the largest negative income experiments of the 1970s. Members of the experimental group already receiving cash welfare were required to choose monthly whether to receive cash benefits from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or the negative income tax. The intended design testing SIME/DIME against existing safety net benefits was upended, as treatment group members receiving AFDC would not sign over to receive the negative income tax without protection of existing benefits, including health insurance, housing vouchers, and subsidized childcare (Christphersen, 1983). Thus, a GI option that fails to protect against the detrimental health and financial impacts of benefits loss in the current policy landscape is demonstrably infeasible.",

This makes SEED the first contemporary pilot to bring the ethical concerns around loss of benefits to the forefront of the GI policy debate, and one that can guide ethical and just implementation of GI. Rather than relying on economic projections, GI pilots are taking place in real time and carry real world impacts for recipients. Thus, there is a clear immediacy for public health and social work professionals to uphold the ethics of the respective professions while producing sound empirical evidence capable of influencing public policy. Moreover, while some developing GI pilots may not be governed by human subject research protections mandated by IRBs, similar ethical measures should be considered to protect GI recipients within the existing policy landscape. This paper demonstrates how SEED used ethical mandates of both public health and social work to attend to ethical conflicts inherent in GI experimentation. We begin by describing the pilot design itself as a rubric and exemplar for discussing how implementation and design decisions such as sampling, recipient onboarding, and democratizing human contact effectively preserved recipient benefits in the existing policy landscape.",

We selected a proportion of the population represented in each census tract at random (n = 4200 households) to receive a SEED invitation mailer. After removing duplicate or invalid responses from the mailed invitation (N = 27), the final sample at recruitment baseline was 475. Respondents meeting limited inclusion criteria (i.e., at least 18 years of age with a current Stockton mailing address) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: treatment (n = 125), active control (i.e., participated in all data collection activities; n = 200), or passive control (i.e., did not participate in data collection activities but consented to use of administrative data; n = 150). The treatment group includes five additional participants to account for medical attrition due to a pre-existing condition or a catastrophic medical event that would preclude ongoing participation in research activities. In February 2019, the treatment group began receiving the intervention, an unconditional cash transfer of $500 per month for 18 months on a pre-paid debit card, without work requirements or spending restrictions.

Because the purpose of SEED is testing GI alongside existing safety net benefits, not in place of them, we implemented several loss mitigation steps including a sampling frame without a household-level designee, onboarding of potential recipients that included benefits counseling as a part of informed consent, and intentional human contact between SEED staff and recipients as they navigate the existing benefits structure.",

Reducing friction in the social safety net and the threat automation and artificial intelligence pose for technological unemployment are often cited as rationales for introducing a universal basic income or GI (Goodin, 2013; Walker, 2016). These potential shifts are already present in low-wage retail sectors where automation is eliminating human contact in a variety of transactions previously marked with relational interactions (Hegewisch & Hartmann, 2019). Meanwhile, unlike early research around the digital divide citing socio-economic gaps between those with access to technological advances and information technology and those without (Norris, 2001), the drop in the cost of technology coupled with the comparatively expensive nature of human employment is rendering new questions about who is granted access to human contact in their everyday lives and under what terms. As Nellie Bowles (2019) argues, \u201chuman contact is now a luxury good,\u201d whereby those with considerably more capital have the latitude to ensure their children's education, their market transactions, their care work, and medical interactions are laced with relational interactions rather than mediated through screens and artificial intelligence. Part of GI's appeal is its potential to address the threat of technological unemployment through a mechanism that simultaneously reduces the friction of human contact required to maintain large bureaucratic structures governed by means testing. Paradoxically, however, the final critical tier of mitigating benefits loss, upholding ethical principles and ensuring implementation efficiency, rests on the human contact and relationship building between SEED's program staff and the research team. Maintaining intentional recipient engagement while navigating a fluid policy landscape requires relational friction in order to preserve benefits while receiving GI.",

Researchers operate under ethical mandates to ensure that their work does not produce new inequalities, threaten individual agency, or discredit the field by failing to account for feasibility concerns. While IRBs seek to protect human subjects in research, given the lack of standard benefit eligibility requirements and income calculations, they may fail to realize the potential impact of cash transfers on recipients\u2019 overall resources. For pilots that are not governed by these boards, it is even more important that researchers remain proactive to protect recipients by upholding professional practice standards. Both the public health and social work professions are uniquely positioned to conduct research that is empirically and ethically sound. Here, we provide effective practices for mitigating the loss of existing benefits from SEED, one of the first contemporary GI experiments.",
