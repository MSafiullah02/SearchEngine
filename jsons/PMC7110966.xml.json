This change had also resulted in the reduction of case-fatality rate from 65% mainly in severe cases to 44.5% in mixed population [44]. This reduction was partially related to an increase in the rate of asymptomatic individuals from 0% to 28.6% in early reports [44]. A summary of studies addressing asymptomatic MERS cases in Humans is shown in Table 1. In early cases from April 2012 to October 2013, there were 144 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases including 18 (12.5%) asymptomatic individuals [33]. In one study from Saudi Arabia, 4 (0.8%) of 520 asymptomatic HCWs screened were positive [35]. In South Korea, 3 (0.5%) of 591 asymptomatic HCWs were detected positive via PCR screening [34]. In a recent study from Saudi Arabia, 17 out of 879 HCWs tested positive for MERS-CoV and 53% of them were asymptomatic by PCR [41].",

Asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition (42%) compared to 86% of fatal cases [45]. However, serologic evaluation of contacts and patients may underestimate the extent of the disease as antibodies wane over time and is related to disease severity [46].

However, there were no reported cases among pilgrims in 2012 [[57], [58], [59], [60]]. Thus, the Saudi Ministry of Health utilized the MERS-CoV case definition for monitoring any occurrence of the disease during Hajj for early detection of cases among pilgrims [61]. An enhanced surveillance system was established for the detection of MERS-CoV cases. The disease remains limited to the Middle East with the exception of sporadic travel associated infections and the large outbreak in South Korea [22,28,62,63]. In one study conducted September 2012\u2013October 2013, 77 travelers from the Middle East met the possible case definition for MERS and two of them tested positive for MERS [28]. In a small study of 14 retuning Pilgrims, all patients were hospitalized for respiratory symptoms and none of them tested positive for MERS-CoV in Marseille France in October 2013 [64]. Furthermore, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected cases and all samples tested negative for MERS-COV [56]. Another small study of 7 Pilgrims in 2014 in Austria, none had MERS-CoV [65].",

These RT-PCR positive persons with mild or no symptoms are usually identified when conducting laboratory screening tests as part of active case monitoring or contact investigations. Asymptomatic health care workers may contribute to healthcare associated transmission and asymptomatic travelers may potentially transmit the infection to household contacts. The WHO recommends the isolation of asymptomatic PCR-positive individuals and daily follow up for the occurrence of symptoms. Those individuals should be tested at least weekly and HCWs should not return to work until two consecutive upper respiratory tract samples are RT-PCR negative [87]. In a study of severe cases and those with mild disease, the latter group cleared MERS-CoV at an earlier time than patients with severe disease whereby on day 12, 30% of mild cases and 76% of severe cases were positive for MERS-CoV by PCR [88]. Another study reported prolonged nasal virus RNA detection (more than 5 weeks) from one asymptomatic RT-PCR positive health-care worker [89].",
