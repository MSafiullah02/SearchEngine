However, the related mechanisms are not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that autophagy inhibition in lung tissues is closely associated with pulmonary fibrosis [7, 8]. In addition, our recent study revealed that LPS could inhibit lung fibroblast autophagy by activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway [9]. However, the mechanism underlining LPS-induced PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition remains largely unknown.",

Integrin \u03b23 is the main integrin heterodimer on the surface of lung fibroblasts [17]. Previous studies have shown a protective role for integrin \u03b23 in lung disease, e.g., programmed cell death prevention in lung fibroblasts in response to transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) stimulation with activation of survival signals during TGF-\u03b21 stimulation [18]. However, little is known regarding the role of integrin \u03b23 in sepsis-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Multiple studies suggested that integrins are involved in the regulation of autophagy by activating its downstream PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby controlling lung fibroblast viability and migration [17, 19]. Therefore, we hypothesized that in LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, LPS may activate the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibit lung fibroblast autophagy by downregulating Thy-1 and upregulating integrin \u03b23.",

However, no differences were observed after cilengitide treatment (Fig. 3b, d).

As a membrane-bound glycoprotein, Thy-1 is also an important regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, activates intracellular signaling pathways, and affects a variety of cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [29, 30]. Thy-1 is inversely associated with phenotypic characteristics in fibrosis and considered a \u201cfibrosis suppressor gene\u201d [31]. Several studies have suggested that the absence of Thy-1 in lung fibroblasts correlates with pulmonary fibrosis [32, 33], and our previous study revealed that Thy-1-related lung fibroblast phenotype transformation is essential for LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation. Integrin \u03b23 is an important adhesion molecule [34] involved in cell proliferation, survival and cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that integrin \u03b23 may be a viable anti-fibrotic target in various fibrotic diseases. In bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, integrin \u03b23 expression is particularly enhanced in mesenchymal stromal cells. In normal Thy-1(+) lung fibroblasts, Thy-1 interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 to inhibit collagen-induced cell activation [31, 32]. Meanwhile, studies have confirmed that loss of Thy-1 expression leads to the activation of integrin \u03b23 and the downstream FAK/PI3K/ Rac1 signaling pathway [35, 36]. As shown above, LPS induced Thy-1 depletion and integrin \u03b23 upregulation played an important role in LPS-induced PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition and pulmonary fibrosis.",

Referring to a previous research [38], we used Co-IP to analyze the interaction of Thy-1 and integrin \u03b23. Our results revealed a strong interaction between Thy-1 and integrin \u03b23 in lung fibroblasts, which decreased significantly after LPS challenge. Subsequently, we applied flow cytometry to detect PAC-1, a marker of integrin \u03b23 activation, in lung fibroblasts [39, 40]. The results showed that LPS challenge led to enhanced activation of integrin \u03b23 in lung fibroblasts. integrin \u03b23 has been reported to be upstream of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in various cell types. Because integrin receptors do not possess a catalytic activity, the signaling pathway induced by integrin activation must be transmitted into cells through activation of integrin-associated proteins such as PI3K and FAK. This indicates PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling or similar pathways may be activated when integrin \u03b23 is overexpressed. Studies have shown that integrin \u03b23 upregulation inhibits the autophagic process in cardiomyocytes by activating Akt [41], suggesting that the expression status of integrin may affect cell autophagy.",
