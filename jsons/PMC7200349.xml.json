The negative function is the cost of conducting the recommended response (response cost).10 The constructs perceived vulnerability and perceived severity are part of the threat appraisal, which results in fear. This means the more an individual feels vulnerable and takes the threat seriously their fear increases, which leads to a greater threat appraisal.8\n",

In addition, construct validity was examined through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the same study sample population. PCA yielded two components in protection motivation: proactive protection motivation and passive protection motivation (unpublished data). Four items loaded as proactive protection motivation, which examined the emergency room nurse\u2019s motivation to actively identify and seek resources or prevent the spread of the Ebola virus by adhering to the rules and regulations set by their place of employment. One item loaded as passive protection motivation, which examined the emergency nurse\u2019s motivation to stay inactive by being hands-off (such as avoid going to work) when confronted with a situation where a patient might have the Ebola infection. Each of the remaining survey constructs, i.e. self-efficacy, response efficacy, response cost, knowledge, outcome expectations, perceived vulnerability, perceived severity and fear yielded only one component with PCA. To test the reliability of the instrument, internal consistency and stability were evaluated using a convenience sample of emergency nurses (n=23) to conduct Cronbach\u2019s alpha and Spearman Rho Correlation respectively. Cronbach\u2019s alpha ranged between .46 and .97, with six of the eight survey constructs having an alpha of .80 or greater, which were within the recommended range.24 Spearman Rho Correlation was conducted to assess the stability of responses in each construct at two different points in time by examining the statistical significance of the coefficient. Items that had a p-value less than or equal to .05 were removed or modified. The survey had ten sections comprised of items for each construct and demographic questions. The instrument included six items on perceived vulnerability, seven items on perceived severity, four items on response efficacy, five items on self-efficacy, seven items on fear, five items on response cost, five items on protection motivation and six items on outcome expectation, with each item having five-point one directional response options. The knowledge portion of the survey had six multiple-choice and seven true/false questions. Lastly, the instrument had sixteen demographic questions.",

Such educational intervention also improved PPE compliance from 44% to 69%.6 In instances where the infectious agent is new such as with the current COVID-19 pandemic, nurses can use prior education and training to direct their current protective behaviors.",

Furthermore, administrators should be aware of the influencing factors and barriers that prevent the use of PPE among nurses. A focus group study indicated that emergency situations, availability of equipment, negative influence of protective equipment on nurses, patient discomfort, being busy, implementing guidelines being time consuming and physicians influence were cited as barriers that may influence a nurse\u2019s compliance with standard precautions, even if they received continuous training.33 Although these factors were identified by participants in the focus group as barriers to the use of PPE among nurses, these findings may not be supported for other communicable infectious diseases. The transmission route, knowledge and outcome expectations as well as the mortality and morbidity associated with an infectious disease may have an influence on nurses\u2019 proactive protection motivation, which could limit their engagement in the recommended protective health behaviors. More specifically, nurses\u2019 perceived severity and perceived vulnerability towards an infectious disease may have a stronger impact than their response efficacy and self-efficacy, which might enable them to be proactive in their motivation to engage in protective health behaviors. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, multiple anecdotal evidence is emerging in support of nurses being proactive in their motivation to engage in protective health behaviors.",
