            "text": "A major challenge in human vaccine science is finding appropriate models for studying antibody responses. Animals such as mice, rabbits and monkeys have typically been used in the past and the small animals, in particular, have been favored for ease of immunization, cost reasons and the ability to extensively biopsy post-immunization. One limitation is their use of non-human immunoglobulin (V, D, J) genes in antibodies which can be restricted in their specificity1, and/or lack residues needed for priming by a germline targeting immunogen2. One approach to solving this problem of wild-type animal models is to use humanized immunoglobulin loci-transgenic rodents3,4. The first demonstration of a transgenic rodent with the ability to express human IgM was 30 years ago5. Since then, advances in genetic engineering technologies allowed for the first transgenic mice strains that express fully human antibodies6,7. Today, many new transgenic animal models have been developed including rodents, chickens, rabbits and cows8. These animal models have been used extensively for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)9, tolerance studies10 and more recently for modelling human antibody responses to vaccine candidates3,4. Here we focus on one such animal model: a rat with expression of humanized chimeric antibodies.",

            "text": "The generation of antibody diversity begins with the development of B cells in the bone marrow. Three unlinked loci contain the immunoglobulin gene segments necessary for the assembly of an antibody: one heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 and two light chain loci (lambda and kappa found on chromosomes 2 and 22 respectively). Large pre-B cells derived from common lymphoid progenitors randomly join VH, DH, and JH gene segments to produce a heavy chain. This process requires V(D)J recombinase: a protein complex that contains RAG1, RAG2 and Artemis (among others). P and N nucleotides are added in the VH-DH and DH-JH junctions by Artemis and TdT, dramatically increasing sequence diversity. After successful pairing of this newly formed heavy chain with surrogate light chain (SLC), recombination of a light chain from V and J gene segments of the kappa or lambda loci occurs and the B cell swaps the SLC for this new light chain. Unless the immature B cell is autoreactive or anergic and undergoes receptor editing or clonal deletion, it matures into a na\u00efve B cell and migrates to the periphery whereupon it can become activated by encountering antigen and form germinal centers with help from T-cells. Sequence diversity is again enhanced in the germinal center by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and/or class switch recombination (CSR), two processes that depend on activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The OmniRat was created by genomic integration of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci on a background of inactivated endogenous rat Ig loci. It expresses chimeric heavy chains (i.e. human V, D, and J genes and rat constant genes) that pair with fully human light chains11,12. We sought to characterize the circulating antibody repertoire diversity in this animal and make comparisons to humans.",

Reverse transcription of antibody RNA and combined tagging with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) have allowed us14 and others15,16 to correct for error and bias in antibody sequencing. Using these methods to gain insight into the antibody repertoire of OmniRats, we ask whether or not it accurately represents that of humans, and by extension allows for usefulness in the approximation of the human antibody response. We postulate that there are major differences in the repertoires due to distinctness in the Ig loci genomic structure and genes that shape antibody diversity between species. Here, we provide the most thorough description of humanized transgenic rodent antibody repertoires to date and leverage a novel extremely deep human dataset to make comparisons with implications of immediate use as a reference for OmniRat immunization studies.",

Gene segments from these families are important contributors to the generation of unusually long CDRH3s in humans and are consistently found in certain broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that bind to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope (Env) glycoprotein, indicating the importance of these rearrangements in HIV vaccine studies20. On average, the frequency of antibodies with D3-J6 rearrangements in OmniRats is 0.012 with little variation, while in humans the frequency of these antibody species is more variable between subjects with a higher mean of 0.028 (Fig. 2d). The preference of OmniRats for shorter CDRH3 lengths and DH gene segments can be placed in the context of shorter DH gene lengths in the wild-type rat (Rattus norvegicus) as compared to human DH genes (Fig. 2e), indicating a possible biologically intrinsic bias.",

Any clonotype found in both tissue compartments must have originated from different B cells, allowing for the measurement of repeatedly observed clonotypes. Rarefaction curves for each animal were generated (Fig. 3a) and indicate a low frequency of repeatedly observed clonotypes. We estimated diversity using Chao 222,23 and Recon23,24 as previously described13. Diversity estimates were similar between the two estimators, (4.8 \u00d7 106\u20137.4 \u00d7 106) for Chao and (9.4 \u00d7 106\u20131.9 \u00d7 107) for Recon (Fig. 3b). We next estimated heavy chain sequence diversity for each animal (Fig. 3c) and again found that both estimators broadly agreed, giving similar values of (5.0 \u00d7 107\u20138.1 \u00d7 107) for Chao and (5.4 \u00d7 107\u20131.0 \u00d7 108) for Recon.

Our results show that there exists substantial variation in gene usage frequencies and elements of recombination, indicating specific limitations of this animal model for predicting the human immune response. We found that by performing hierarchical clustering on gene segment usage, repertoires clustered together by both species and tissue. Differences in gene segment usage between transgenic animal models and humans, as well as between tissues are expected. For example, multiple human Ig loci transgenic rodents are reported to have gene usage profiles that slightly vary from that of humans25,26. Furthermore, antibody repertoires from separate human tissues are known to deviate strongly enough to be clustered by hierarchical clustering27. In our case, the lymph node repertoire from the OmniRat was most likely able to be distinguished from that of the spleen due to the increased presence of antigen-experienced B cells in the latter as shown by somatic hypermutation and class-switched transcript frequencies. This indicates that tissue selection will affect the outcome of an antibody discovery campaign and reinforces evidence for normal B cell development by suggesting the existence of affinity maturation.",

The specific reasons remain unclear, although the observation that wild-type rat germline D gene segment lengths are shorter suggests intrinsic species-specific mechanisms of selection as well as differences in TdT expression during bone marrow B cell development.

We have also shown that this animal\u2019s antibodies show signs of class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation and large diversity supporting its value for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies to targets that may not be immunogenic in other models. Even though a high degree of variation exists, we still found many clonotypes to be shared between the species pools. Finally, more studies will need to be done in order to characterize OmniRat serum and memory B cell responses to immunogens.",

We chose to interrogate the antibody repertoires found in secondary lymphoid organs as opposed to peripheral blood due to the higher number of B cells. Correct PCR product sizes were verified on an agarose gel (E-Gel EX; Invitrogen) and quantified with fluorometry (Qubit; Life Technologies), pooled at approximately equimolar concentrations and each sample pool was re-quantified before sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3, 600-cycle).
