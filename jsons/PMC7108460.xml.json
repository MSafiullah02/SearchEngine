The serum procurement, data management, and blood collection protocols were approved by the Beijing SARS-Control Working Group and were in accordance with WHO biosafety guidelines (27). Among the retrospective samples, only 74 were selected from probable patients whose blood samples were collected with onset of fever within 7 days at the time of admission (acute SARS patients; Table 1 ). Probable cases were based on the eligibility criteria set forth by WHO (15). These cases had also radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest x-ray. The paired convalescent serum samples from the SARS cohort tested positive for IgM seroconversion by the IFA method (Beijing Genomics Institute), and four samples also tested positive in a DNA array test using nasopharyngeal samples. The 1067 non-SARS control serum samples (Table 2 ) were obtained from recruited healthy donors (n = 659) or from patients with respiratory infections [pneumonia (n = 176) or high fever (n = 203; 66 with influenza A)] or lung cancer (n = 29). The control samples were all negative for SARS-CoV seroconversion.",

The weakly cationic exchange chip (WCX) gave the best results with mass spectra from 0 to 200 kDa. The WCX chips in an 8-well bioprocessor format (Ciphergen) were chosen to allow a larger volume of serum for the chip array. The bioprocessor was pretreated with 150 \u03bcL of 100 mmol/L sodium acetate (pH 4) on a platform shaker at 250 rpm for 5 min. The excess sodium acetate was removed by inverting the bioprocessor on a paper towel. This process was repeated twice. The serum samples were thawed on ice in a Biosafety Level II cabinet, and 20 \u03bcL of each sample was mixed with 30 \u03bcL of U9 buffer (9 mol/L urea, 10 g/L CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline) in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and vortex-mixed at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. We then added 100 \u03bcL of U1 buffer [U9 buffer diluted by ninefold (100 mL of U9 buffer plus 800 mL of Tris-HCl) with 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7)] to the serum/urea mixture, vortex-mixed it for 10 min, and stopped the reaction by addition of 600 \u03bcL of sodium acetate on ice. We applied 50 \u03bcL of the serum/urea sample to each well, and the bioprocessor was sealed and shaken on a platform shaker at 250 rpm for 30 min. The excess serum/urea solution was discarded, and the bioprocessor was washed three times with 100 mmol/L sodium acetate as described above. The chips were removed from the bioprocessor, washed twice with deionized water, and air-dried. Subsequently 0.5 \u03bcL of EAM sinapinic acid saturated in 500 mL/L acetonitrile\u20135 g/L trifluoroacetic acid was added to each well. After air-drying, the sinapinic acid application was repeated.",

To avoid the possibility that placement or run order of samples would affect assay accuracy, samples were loaded on chips in a rotational fashion. In brief, sample 1 was spotted on the 8-well directional chip (wells A to H) in duplicate in wells A and B and then in wells G and H of the second chip. Samples 2, 3, and 4 were loaded on chips in the same rotation order. We also randomized the order of chip placement in the spectrometer to minimize bias from run order.

The m/z range between 0 and 2000 was eliminated from analysis to avoid interference from adducts, artifacts of the energy-absorbing molecules, and other possible chemical contaminants. Peak detection involved baseline subtraction, mass normalization using a common calibrant peak (m/z 6635.09), and normalization to the total ion current intensity with a minimum m/z of 2000, using an external normalization coefficient of 0.2 (normalization factor for individual spectrum = 0.2/average ion current for each spectrum) for spectra obtained at different times or locations. The settings used for autodetect peaks to cluster in the first pass were a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and a minimum peak threshold of 5% of all spectra. The peak clusters were completed by second-pass peak detection using a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 and 0.3% of mass for the cluster window. An average of 99 peaks was detected in each spectrum. The mass range from 20 to 200 kDa was analyzed in parallel.",

The classification algorithm used four peaks between 3 and 12 kDa (m/z 3939.08, 4137.71, 8136.64, and 11 514.2) and generated five terminal nodes (Fig. 1 ). These discriminatory peaks efficiently split SARS specimens into terminal nodes 3 and 5 and non-SARS samples into terminal nodes 1, 2, and 4. Each mass peak showed a mean intensity ratio of SARS vs non-SARS >3 and a P value close to 0 (Table 3 ). Notably, the protein or peptide with masses at 3939.08, 8136.64, and 11 514.2 Da was up-regulated in patients with acute SARS, whereas that of a mass at 4137.71 Da was down-regulated compared with healthy controls or patients with respiratory tract infections. A representative spectrum of a SARS specimen aligned with that of a healthy control (Fig. 2A ) showed the four fingerprints in node 3 required for pattern recognition in the classifier. The unique presence of the root biomarker, m/z 3939.08, is demonstrated in the alignment of representative spectra of samples from patients with acute SARS (1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the onset of fever; from terminal node 5) and those from healthy controls and patients with fever and influenza or pneumonia (Fig. 2B ). This decision algorithm correctly classified 37 of 37 (100%) of the acute SARS samples and 72 of 74 (97.3%) of the non-SARS controls in the training set (Table 3 ).",

When applied to the blinded test set, this discriminatory profiling method precisely classified 97.3% of patients with acute SARS and 99.4% of non-SARS patients. More strikingly, our classifier was able to discriminate SARS-CoV infection from bacterial (mycoplasma, tuberculosis) and other local (influenza) or systemic (measles) viral infections of the respiratory tract with a specificity reaching 100%. This was attributable to the inclusion of corresponding inflammatory control samples in the training set and optimization of the classification algorithm. The biomarkers identified in the acute phase of SARS seemed to remain throughout the convalescent phase of the disease because when we applied the identical tree classification to samples from patients in whom onset of fever had been >2, 3, 4, and >5 weeks previously, we could detect SARS with sensitivities and specificities reaching 89.2% and 91.8%, 86.0% and 91.8%, 93.1% and 91.8%, and 79.5% and 91.8%, respectively (data not shown).

Although the possibility might exist that the difference in serum fingerprints would reflect differences among SARS and non-SARS hospitals, the fact that all SARS cases from 38 different hospitals fit into the single classification algorithm would likely rule out such a concern. More importantly, severe and mild cases of SARS from different hospitals, which had been completely randomized in the experimental analysis, fell into distinct nodes of the tree classification, strongly indicating that the biomarkers we have identified were specific to SARS and not the sites at which blood samples were collected. We further minimized the potential sampling bias by simultaneously using four biomarkers instead of one (e.g., m/z 3939.08), which nevertheless could sufficiently delineate SARS from non-SARS (sensitivity = 93.7%; specificity = 91.8%; data not shown).

However, to characterize these peaks would certainly help in understanding the biological roles of these peptide/proteins and could potentially lead to the discovery of more direct diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV.",
