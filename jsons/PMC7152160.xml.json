cubes.1.Oral hydration solutions (Enterolyte, Rebound) may be given instead of water.2.The goal of oral fluid therapy is to provide at least 40 to 60 mL/kg/day.\nB.Once vomiting resolves, food is reintroduced as small quantities of a bland, highly digestible diet.1.Examples for dogs include low-fat chicken or turkey with rice or potato, or commercial diets (e.g., Hill's i/d, Purina Veterinary Diets EN, Royal Canin Low Fat, Eukanuba Low Residue).2.In cats, low-fat intestinal diets may not be palatable enough, so recovery diets (e.g., Hill's a/d) or canned maintenance foods are also offered.3.Enteral nutrition is essential for recovery of enterocytes (especially in parvoviral infections) and return of normal gut motility patterns, so is reintroduced as soon as possible.4.In some cases, feeding a liquid diet through a nasoesophageal tube may be necessary.\nC.Do not withhold food for >3 days without further nutritional or fluid support, especially in cats (to prevent the risk of hepatic lipidosis) or young kittens and puppies.D.Once vomiting or diarrhea resolves, reintroduce the regular diet over a period of 3 to 7 days.\nII.Parenteral fluid therapy is required for dogs and cats that are dehydrated, have severe vomiting or diarrhea, or are anorectic for >3 days.A.Lactated Ringer's solution or Normosol-R is given at a rate of 40 to 60 mL/kg/day IV, SC, with additional fluids to correct dehydration and replacing ongoing losses.B.Potassium chloride (20 to 40 mEq/L) is added to the fluids if anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea are severe, or if hypokalemia is present.C.Replacement of magnesium sulfate may also be required if serum concentrations of magnesium are low.D.In animals with low serum magnesium and hypokalemia, serum potassium does not return to normal until magnesium levels are corrected.E.Hypoglycemia is a potential complication of severe enteritis in young animals, and requires addition of dextrose to the fluids after the animal is rehydrated.F.IV nutrition (premade amino acid solutions with dextrose or parenteral solutions formulated by a nutritionist and compounded by a pharmacist) may be indicated in dogs or cats that are unwilling or unable to eat after 3 to 4 days of illness.G.Anorectic animals, especially cats, become deficient in B vitamins, so add a multiple B-complex solution (5 to 10 mL/L) to the IV fluids or give SC SID.H.Acid-base disorders are common, but the type and severity vary.1.Fluid therapy and resolution of vomiting and diarrhea resolve most of these abnormalities.2.Specific therapy is recommended only in severe, life-threatening cases when blood gas analysis is performed.\nI.Hetastarch or plasma therapy is indicated in dogs with severe hypovolemia, endotoxemia, or severe hypoalbuminemia (<1.5 g/dL).J.\nSC fluid therapy may be sufficient in animals with only moderate clinical signs.\nIII.Isolate affected dogs or cats from other animals to prevent spread of infection.A.Meticulous hygiene, both of personnel and the hospital cages and runs, is essential to prevent spread of viral infection.B.Instruct owners to properly dispose of all fecal material to reduce environmental contamination.C.Parvoviruses and coronaviruses are very hardy and can survive for long periods in the environment, but sodium hypochlorite (Clorox) and some newer disinfecting agents will kill these viruses.\nIV.Antibiotics are rarely necessary in mild cases of viral enteritis.A.In animals with severe or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, especially with leukopenia, use parenteral antibiotics to prevent septicemia.1.Some puppies with parvovirus infection have asymptomatic bacteruria, suggesting antibacterial therapy is essential.2.Four-quadrant therapy protects against gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacterial septicemia.3.Utilize ampicillin 11 to 22 mg/kg IV, IM TID to QID and amikacin 6 to 8 mg/kg IV SID, or enrofloxacin 2.5 to 5 mg/kg IV, IM BID.\nB.In dogs with suspected septicemia or endotoxemia, more aggressive antibiotic therapy may be necessary.1.Cefoxitin 15 to 30 mg/kg IV, IM TID to QID2.Timentin 40 to 50 mg/kg IV TID to QID3.Imipenem 2 to 7 mg/kg IV, IM TID\n\nV.Antiemetic therapy is indicated for severe vomiting.A.Prochlorperazine 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg IM BID to TID in the dog and 0.125 mg/kg IM BID in the catB.Metoclopramide 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg SC, IM, IV BID to QID or as a constant rate infusion of 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg/hr IVC.Chlorpromazine 0.05 mg/kg IV TID to QID or 1 to 2 mg/kg SC TID to QID in the dogD.Dolasetron 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg SC SID to TIDE.Ondansetron 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg SC TID in the dog\nVI.Other supportive therapy includes the following:A.IV immune globulin can be administered to severely neutropenic dogs with parvovirus infection, but it is expensive and difficult to obtain.B.Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be given to increased neutrophil counts; however, it may not affect morbidity or survival (Cohn et al., 1999).C.Motility-modifying agents or antidiarrheals are not recommended in acute, infectious gastroenteritis, and are given only to dogs with mild diarrhea.D.In cats with FIP, corticosteroids are recommended to maintain appetite and reduce the granulomas associated with the dry form of the disease, but their effectiveness has not been proven.E.Antiviral therapy has not been shown to improve survival in FIP or CPV infections and may be associated with significant side effects.F.Anecdotally, oseltamixir phosphate (Tomiflu) may be beneficial in dogs when given at 2 mg/kg PO BID for 5 days, especially if administered within 24 to 48 hours of onset of signs.\n\n",

however, cultures should be followed by PCR assays.C.Fecal \u03b11-protease inhibitor assay detects fecal protein loss in dogs with PLE.1.This protein is not affected by intestinal or bacterial degradative processes, but is similar in size to albumin and is lost into the lumen if there is intestinal protein leakage.2.The assay has been validated in dogs but not in cats, and requires obtaining three separate, defecated fecal samples.3.Send samples directly to the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M University for processing using special collection kits provided.4.The assay can be falsely elevated in animals with parasites and other GI disturbances, and from collection problems.\nD.Other fecal tests (fecal fat, proteolytic activity, occult blood) are nonspecific, insensitive, and not recommended.\nIII.Other serum tests may be helpful in identifying intestinal, pancreatic, or hepatic disease associated with malabsorption.A.Trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI)1.The TLI assay is a species-specific assay for the pancreatic acinar cell enzymes, trypsinogen and trypsin.2.Normal serum TLI of dogs is 5.2 to 35 \u03bcg/L and of cats is 12 to 82 \u03bcg/L.3.Serum TLI is unaffected by small intestinal disease, but is markedly low in dogs or cats with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.4.Elevated levels correlate poorly in dogs and only moderately well in cats with acute pancreatitis.5.Serum is collected following a fast for 6 to 12 hours.\nB.Serum vitamin concentrations (folate and cobalamin)1.Decreased levels of folate occur with severe proximal or diffuse small intestinal disease.2.Increased folate levels are observed in animals on parenteral supplementation, and in dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or with antibiotic responsive enteritis.3.Increased levels of folate are also present in hemolyzed blood samples from leakage of the vitamin from RBCs.4.A cobalamin deficiency reflects ileal disease, exo-crine pancreatic insufficiency, or may occur in the presence of antibiotic responsive enteritis (dogs).5.Elevated levels of cobalamin have unknown clinical significance, but may occur with excess parenteral supplementation.6.Assays for both cobalamin and folate must be validated and normal values established for each species.a.Samples are collected after a 6- to 12-hour fast and stored in darkness, because cobalamin is light sensitive.b.Because serum vitamin concentrations can be low in animals with both exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and small intestinal disease, simultaneous serum TLI assay is recommended.\n7.Cats may be more susceptible to cobalamin deficiency because of their increased need for cobalamin.\nC.Measurements of intestinal permeability1.\nTests of intestinal permeability are used to noninvasively determine the presence of intestinal mucosal damage from gluten enteropathy, acute gastroenteritis, IBD, neoplasia, and other diseases.2.The standard test uses the probe 51Cr-labeled EDTA; however, the marker is not suitable for use in private clinical practice or many referral practices.3.Other tests use two sugars, one disaccharide (cellobiose, lactulose) and one monosaccharide (mannitol, rhamnose) to determine intestinal permeability by measuring the amount excreted in urine and expression of the results as a ratio.\nD.d-Xylose absorption test1.It has a very low sensitivity for small intestinal disease.2.It is impractical and cumbersome to perform in most clinical settings and is not recommended.\nE.Tests for antibiotic responsive enteritis (previously referred to as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)1.Increased serum folate and decreased serum cobalamin levels are suggestive but not specific for the problem.2.Serum unconjugated bile acids increase 10 to 20 times in affected dogs, but an assay is not yet commercially available.3.At this time, the best diagnostic test is culture of intestinal contents to quantitate bacterial numbers, and isolate known or potential pathogens.a.Recent evidence indicates that this method is inadequate for identification of bacterial numbers and species in the intestinal tract (Suchodolski et al., 2005).b.DNA technology may be the most reliable and accurate means of identifying and enumerating the wide variety of bacterial species colonizing the intestinal tract, but is only available at research laboratories.\n\n\nIV.Imaging studies are indicated, but may give nonspecific results and are used to rule out other diseases.A.Survey abdominal radiography is often normal.B.Upper GI contrast studies may reveal foreign bodies, masses, intestinal obstruction or intussusception, and gastric or intestinal ulcers (see Chapter 4).C.Abdominal ultrasonography is used to detect changes in echogenicity of abdominal organs and bowel thickness or irregularities, for identifying lymphadenopathy or other intraabdominal masses, and for obtaining biopsies and aspirates.\nV.Endoscopic examination permits direct visualization of the mucosa and provides an opportunity to obtain multiple samples for cytology, biopsy, and culture.A.In animals with weight loss or chronic diarrhea, samples for biopsy are obtained from multiple sites (stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon).B.Properly obtained biopsies include submucosa and intact mucosa in the proper orientation (i.e., carefully uncurled and lying flat on a biopsy sponge to maintain orientation).C.In some cases, endoscopic biopsies may not be sufficient for diagnosis (e.g., focal disease in jejunum unreachable by the endoscope, serosal disease, edematous changes), and full-thickness biopsies may be required.D.Cytological examination of endoscopically obtained tissue can often be used to make a rapid diagnosis of inflammatory changes present in the mucosa (Jergens, 2003).\nVI.Histological examination is essential to document villous atrophy and other architectural changes; verify that lymphatic dilatation is consistent with lymphangiectasia; and confirm neoplastic, inflammatory, or other infiltrative diseases.VII.Intestinal samples can also be submitted for specialized assays, including analysis for marker enzymes (e.g., lactase, alkaline phosphatase) or cell surface markers cluster differentiation (CD; e.g., CD4, CD8) to help distinguish neoplastic from inflammatory infiltrates.\n",
