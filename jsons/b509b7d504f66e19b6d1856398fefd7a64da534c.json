This risk is particularly elevated in patients with neutropenia or lymphopenia, which is often the case in patients treated with chemotherapy. In Wuhan, 1% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were reported to suffer from cancer, which is more than three times the incidence of cancer in the Chinese population [2] . In addition, in 39% of cancer patients (compared to 8% of patients without cancer) transfer to the intensive care unit was necessary, with their illness deteriorating more rapidly (13 vs 43 days to severe event) [2] . Chemotherapy or surgery <1 month before was an important risk factor (OR 5.34, p=0.0026).",
