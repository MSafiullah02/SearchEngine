            "text": "Over the past two decades, China has been undergoing a process of economic reform and has been relatively successful. The healthcare system, which had been reformed to suit the market economy,5 faced multiple challenges: limited financial support from governments; high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending and impoverishment through health expenses; inequalities in health and healthcare utilization; and limited financial protection even among those with insurance (a small minority of the population).6 Due to the above challenges, the old \u2018three-tiered\u2019 hospital system, which involved local neighbourhood hospitals, district-wide secondary hospitals and city-wide tertiary hospitals, was forced to rely on the sales of new drugs and technologies to boost income, which resulted in expensive and inefficient care and strained patient\u2013doctor relationships.7 The old public health system was the responsibility of dozens of disparate institutes, centres, agencies, bureaus and departments, which resulted in overlapping and sometimes conflicting mission statements and agency mandates.8 With an increase in life expectancy, increased burden due to chronic diseases, and the challenges of emerging infectious diseases (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003), the Chinese Government re-examined the public health infrastructure and saw the need for a new public health system to address the many health issues associated with these changes.5 To minimize overlapping of functions and to increase efficiency, the Chinese Government consolidated existing institutions into a new agency: the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of the CDC is to provide a central public health organization with responsibility for both community and individual health needs. The development of the CDC strengthened the Government\u2019s role in public health.5 As public health and primary care share the common goal of improving the overall health of specific populations, it was decided to integrate the two systems by strengthening public health functions in primary healthcare settings. This approach could improve local public health surveillance and reinforce disease prevention and health promotion.9 In order to resolve the problems of the increasing burden of healthcare expenses and limited access to health services, the Chinese Government initiated its CHS programme in 1997.4 The \u2018three-tiered\u2019 hospital system was replaced by the current \u2018two-tiered\u2019 CHS centre system. The new system consists of ambulatory care in CHS centres and inpatient care in referral hospitals.7 The main roles of the CHS centres are to provide high-quality, affordable, accessible primary health care and public health services to community residents.",

Analysis and interpretation were reached by consensus, using an iterative process in the research team meetings. The research team was a multidisciplinary group including two community-based medical researchers with qualitative and social research experience, one health administrator from a health bureau familiar with health policy, one family doctor familiar with the CHS, two epidemiologists and one Masters degree candidate with a family medicine degree.

A baseline survey of CHS organizations in 29 cities in 200826 showed that Shanghai was the most highly funded, at \u00a34.77 per person per year for basic public health services. On the other hand, in 2006, some less developed cities only supplied funds of \u00a30.48 per person per year. The budget in Beijing is \u00a32.38 per person per year since 2008; however, Beijing CHS centres are required to deliver more basic public health services than their counterparts in other provinces. The deficiency in funding has become such a problem that some basic public health services cannot be implemented effectively in Beijing. The Municipal Government is now assessing how much money should be devoted to basic public health services on the basis of its funding capability and the demands of stakeholders. In addition, migrants need to be recognized as a specific target group for health promotion, prevention and health care,27 and the governments should provide additional funding for them.",

In Beijing, the allocation is one general practitioner per 3000 residents, one nurse per 25,000 residents and one public health specialist per 2000 residents.20 In fact, the above allocation rates have not yet been met, especially since the demand for much of the scope and quality of public health services has increased. In addition, the low levels of CHS providers\u2019 knowledge and skills4 is a major problem. As a result, basic public health services are often only provided in response to patient requests or obvious needs in Beijing; services thus tend to be reactive rather than proactive. It may simply be unrealistic to expect community providers to deliver a comprehensive package of basic public health services along with the many competing demands of providing direct clinical care.21 In view of the reasons mentioned above, Beijing Municipal Government is planning several programmes to improve the service capabilities of the CHS providers. These include partial changes in the structure, roles and functions of the teams; incentives to attract more medical graduates to work in community settings; redistribution of tertiary hospital doctors to CHS organizations; re-employment of retired doctors in the CHS; and the provision of financial support and opportunities for younger doctors to get better continuing medical education.4\n",

In fact, people with insurance prefer to visit doctors in hospitals to CHS organizations. In order to attract more people to visit the CHS, CHS organizations are required to supply acceptable services by decreasing drug prices and increasing the proportion of medical reimbursement.31 Beijing Municipal Government is currently devoting significant funding to publicizing basic public health services in the community by means of various media, and is encouraging residents with common diseases to see general practitioners.",

The data were cross-sectional in nature. The possibility that the non-responding directors were different from the 15 interviewed directors can not be excluded. The study examined basic public health services from the perspective of supervisors, who do not themselves provide direct primary medical care. It did not examine the broader frame of basic public health services in the community and overall population levels. The fact that all the data for this study were collected in one city may call into question its generalizability to other locales. However, the choice of Beijing as the site for data collection has particular significance to healthcare service delivery in China because the nation\u2019s capital was one of the first cities to comprehensively implement the CHS reforms of 2006, and thus has had the longest experience with them. In addition, Beijing has traditionally served as a national test site for reforms of the CHS. Accordingly, the authors recommend that further research should be undertaken on the delivery of basic public health services with larger sampling from community providers from other cities in China.",
