SARS-CoV is an enveloped, plus-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that can infect and replicate in a number of human cell types, including pneumocytes and enterocytes in the respiratory system, intestinal mucosal cells, immune cells, and neurons. A defining property of the virus is that it produces a nested set of subgenomic RNAs via discontinuous transcription, which are in turn translated into viral structural proteins as well as additional accessory proteins [3,4]. The four structural proteins include the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which are encoded in the 3\u2019 end of the viral genome; of these, the N-protein is the most abundant protein in virus-infected cells, and is the only protein found in the nucleocapsid.",

While the M protein coordinates the majority of protein-protein interactions required for coronavirus assembly, the coronavirus packaging signal, a cis-regulatory element encoded within the viral RNA, plays an essential role in packaging the viral genome into the capsid. Previous studies have identified the packaging signals of the human coronavirus and the mouse hepatitis virus as a conserved region embedded within the coding sequence for nonstructural protein 15 [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]].

The N-protein harbors two distinct RNA-binding domains, a potentially unique characteristic among capsid proteins of other RNA viruses. While the N-terminal domain (NTD) functions as a monomer, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the N-protein forms oligomers that may drive helical nucleocapsid formation [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. Outside of viral RNA packaging, the N-protein has been implicated in maintaining viral structure and viability, as well as viral RNA transcription and translation.",

            "text": "Although crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance studies have determined the structures for the RNA-binding domains of the various coronoaviruses, no studies to date have characterized the structure of the N-protein-viral RNA complex, or have otherwise elucidated the mechanism by which the N-protein recognizes and interacts with the SARS-CoV viral RNA [15,[20], [21], [22]]. Thus far, studies that have characterized this interaction have relied on systems using either unnatural synthetic RNA or non-viral RNA substrates in vitro. Nonetheless, investigating the ability of the N-protein to interact with the packaging signal in living cells is of particular importance, as this would address whether and if so, how the N-protein alone might be able to recognize and interact specifically with the packaging signal amongst a pool of diverse cellular RNAs in vivo. Here, we address this gap in the literature by developing an in vivo cell-based platform to probe the specific interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and packaging RNA sequence. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV N-protein is specific for the SARS-CoV packaging RNA sequence, with lower affinity for packaging sequences of other coronaviruses and even lower for non-coronavirus species. We also show that a 151-nucleotide sequence (positions 168\u2013318) of the SARS-CoV packaging sequence is critical for N-protein binding. Conversely, deletion mapping of the N-protein revealed that both the NTD and the CTD are necessary for binding CoV packaging sequences, and that neither alone were sufficient. These results represent the first time in which the N-protein-viral RNA interaction was examined in vivo, and provides a framework for further elucidating the exact mechanism by which this interaction occurs in order to coordinate viral packaging.",

This approach failed to identify any positive interactions between the N-protein and the packaging sequence because the expression of LacZ with the reporter vector alone was too low (Fig. 2D). Thus, we used a deletion-mapping approach to probe for specific regions within the SARS-CoV packaging sequence that might be responsible for mediating its interaction with the N-protein. As shown in Fig. 2E, cells expressing a short 151-nt sequence (168\u2013310 position; SARS-PS151) of the full-length packaging sequence alongside the N-protein showed the greatest inhibition (98%) of \u03b2-galactosidase activity. We also investigated the interaction between the N-protein and a 230-nt region (1\u2013230 position; SARS-PS230) of the full-length packaging sequence, which yielded a 41% inhibition of \u03b2-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2F).

Numbers in parenthesis indicate nucleotide lengths of the sequences designated. (B) Effect of N-protein on mouse hepatitis virus PS-lacZ reporter gene expression, and various regions of the PS-RNA sequence (C\u2013G). \u03b2-galactosidase activities achieved upon transformation with individual reporter constructs or control vectors, examined in the presence (red; square) and absence (green; triangle) of N-protein, respectively. pLacZ and pTAC are control plasmids that lack expression of either the packaging signal sequence or N-protein, respectively. Results of the ONPG and CPRG assays measuring the interaction of the SARS-CoV N-protein and each packaging signal RNA are shown on the right, as well as a Western blot demonstrating the expression of LacZ (\u03b2-galactosidase) at 4 h after IPTG induction. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was probed as a loading control. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) of three separate experiments.
