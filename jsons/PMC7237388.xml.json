According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, patients with COVID-19 have symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness (respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties) to severe (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney failure, and death).1 Based on scientific reports,2 this pandemic began in Wuhan City, China, and quickly spread throughout the country. As of March 15, China has confirmed 81,048 cases with 3,204 deaths. Although the COVID-19 incidence has declined sharply since February 13, 2020, in China, the prevalence increased faster in other countries than scientists anticipated. Italy, with 21,157 positive cases and 1,441 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR], 6.81%), and South Korea with 8,162 positive cases and 75 death (CFR, 0.91%), were the countries most affected as of March 15.2",
