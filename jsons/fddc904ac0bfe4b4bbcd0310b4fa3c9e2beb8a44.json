The challenge is to differentiate between primary hematologic emergencies that require specifi c interventions and abnormalities secondary to other disease conditions. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize some of the most common hematologic emergencies seen in critically ill children that are associated with red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC) or platelet disorders. Transfusion medicine, oncologic emergencies, and coagulation disorders are discussed in other chapters. Of importance, many patients admitted for other reasons may have underlying disorders of elements of blood. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into detail about many of these disorders. The reader is kindly referred to books on pediatric hematology. As a consequence, it is therefore necessary for the pediatric critical care physician to collaborate with the pediatric hematologist when managing such patients.",

Clinical symptoms vary widely and include pallor, nausea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, irritability, tachycardia, tachypnea and edema. However, it is not clear what the impact of anemia itself is on outcome of critically ill children. A Hb < 5 g/dL has been associated with increased mortality in non-critically ill children [ 4 -6 ] . Furthermore, anemia was identifi ed as an independent predictor for mortality in critically ill adults, whereas one group of investigators did not observe such an association in a heterogeneous group of critically ill children [ 7 , 8 ] . Importantly, the landmark paper from the TRIPICU study has clearly shown that stable critically ill children can tolerate a Hb of 7 g/dL without serious complications [ 9 ] . In this multicenter prospective study comprising 637 stable critically ill children the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was similar between patients randomized to a restrictive transfusion strategy (threshold Hb 7 g/dL) and liberal transfusion strategy (threshold Hb 9.5 g/dL) within 7 days of PICU admission. A post-hoc analysis of postsurgical PICU patients and children after cardiac surgery showed similar fi ndings [ 10 , 11 ] . At present, no data is available identifying a proper threshold for unstable critically ill children such as those with severe hypoxemia or hemodynamic compromise. Therefore, the decision to treat anemia is determined by the underlying cause, the acuteness, and the physiologic status of the child.",

The most common cause of acquired pancytopenia in the PICU is leukemia -either at presentation or as a consequence of chemotherapy or irradiation.

            "text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most important causes of hemolytic anemia that may bring a patient into the PICU. SCD is the general term for all phenotypes related to mutations in the hemoglobin gene found at chromosome 11p15.4 that are characterized by red cell sickling following hemoglobin deoxygenation, chronic hemolysis, recurrent vaso-occlusion, and ischemic injury to various organs [ 12 ] . Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the most common form of SCD. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the substitution of valine for glutamine at the sixth amino acid position of the beta chain of the hemoglobin gene. Sickle cell trait (SCT) differs from SCA in that it is a heterozygous condition and does not cause active disease. SCA primarily affects individuals from African, Mediterranean, Indian, and Middle Eastern descent, although there is also a high incidence among Hispanic individuals from the Caribbean, Central American and some South American countries [ 13 ] . Factors that promote sickling include desaturation of hemoglobin (either by failure to oxygenate in the lungs, diminished DO 2 or increased tissue extraction of oxygen), and increased microvascular transit time as seen in dehydration or vasoconstriction (Table 20 .4 ). The number of RBCs that sickle depends on the extent and duration of deoxygenation, the proportion of abnormal \u00df-chain in the Hb (HbS) of affected cells, and the presence of fetal Hb in the erythrocytes. The conformational change in HbS enables polymerization between Hb molecules. Children with SCD may carry up to 90-100 % of HbS. HbF effectively reduces the concentration of HbS [ 14 ] . Hydroxyurea promotes the formation of HbF, hence its use is recommended in all patients with SCD to prevent SCD related complications [ 15 ] . Next to this, increased endothelial activity with production of endothelin and circulation of soluble cell adhesion molecules promotes sickle cell adhesion [ 16 , 17 ] . Activation of platelets, adhesion of neutrophils, and proinfl ammatory cytokine release further promote sickling.",

It typically occurs in children between 10 and 27 months of age, though it can also occur in young infants. It is relatively uncommon in older children because they develop functional asplenia over time, caused by repeated infarctions and subsequent fi brosis of the spleen, or autosplenectomy. Acute splenic sequestration crisis often occurs during bacterial or viral infection. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and include splenomegaly and symptoms of intravascular volume depletion. Laboratory investigations show an acute drop in Hb (>2 g/dL), reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and leucopenia. The mainstay of treatment is to restore circulating blood volume and hemodynamic stability through infusion of volume expanders, and by repeated blood or exchange transfusions. One group of investigators has reported substantial mortality (35 %) when the Hb level dropped > 4 g/dL. Performing a splenectomy after a fi rst crisis is controversial because of the infectious risks associated with splenectomy.

It is part of a spectrum that includes thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura, which is seen more often in adults and is characterized by a more important neurologic involvement. Numerous -mainly infectious -agents trigger HUS; Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common, and it is frequently related to insufficient heating of meat. The pathophysiology of HUS is not clear, but likely involves injury to the endothelial cells involving ADAMTS-13 (a von Willebrand factor cleavage protein) and factor H (a complement C3 convertase inhibitor) [ 34 ] . This causes microthrombi and fi brin strands in arterioles that damage RBCs and cause platelet aggregation leading to anemia and thrombocytopenia. Children with HUS frequently present with acute renal failure. Other features include bowel involvement mimicking acute abdomen and central nervous involvement including seizures or altered consciousness. Therapy is mainly supportive and may require renal replacement therapy. Plasma exchange therapy may be benefi cial [ 35 ] and is reviewed elsewhere in this textbook.

Primary AIHA usually occurs after a viral infection. The child suffers from symptoms of anemia and dark urine. Because of the rapid onset, other symptoms such as jaundice or reticulocytosis may not be present. Laboratory studies show isolated anemia, low haptoglobin, spherocytes on peripheral blood smear and a positive direct antiglobulin (i.e. Coombs) test. The indirect Coombs test detects antibodies in the patients' serum. Supportive therapy includes plasma exchange. Transfusion should be avoided unless severe anemia with cardiovascular compromise occurs. Further therapy (e.g., high-dose corticosteroids) is dependent upon the type of primary AIHA, which is defi ned by the presence of IgG antibodies (suggesting warm-reactive AIHA) or complement (suggesting cold-reactive AIHA). Cold-reactive AIHA is then classifi ed by which type of antibody (IgM auto-antibody or IgG) is detected. Secondary AIHA occurs in a wide variety of disease (Table 20 .8 ). ",
