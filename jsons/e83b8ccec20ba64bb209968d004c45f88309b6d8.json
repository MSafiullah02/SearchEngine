Because the diagnosis is based on the clinical history and diagnostic test results, with the gold standard being a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge, conducting large epidemiologic surveys can be difficult because of reliance on questionnairebased tools for identification of food allergy and evidence of IgE sensitization. Because there is no validated questionnaire for food allergy and many reported food allergies are not confirmed when a full diagnostic evaluation is completed, estimates obtained from questionnaires are likely to be inflated. 38 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1359, "end": 1361, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FOOD ALLERGY"}, {"text": "The prevalence of sensitization depends on the selection of allergens.

For example, in the United States, the estimated prevalence of food allergy is 4% to 8% among children, 56, 57 and in Australia, a prevalence of more than 10% among 1-year-old children has been reported. 58 In contrast, findings from a population-based birth cohort from the United Kingdom indicate that between 2.2% and 5.5% of infants have food allergy in the first year of life, 59 and in other U.K. studies, the estimated prevalence of food allergy among 6-year-old children is 1.6% to 2.5%, 60 and among adolescents, it is 2.3%. 61 An international study that used allergen-specific IgE data for young adults confirmed the heterogeneity of food allergy prevalence observed in the questionnaire-based studies. 62 In this study, prevalence of sensitization to any 1 of 24 foods ranged from 7.7% in Iceland to 24.6% in the United States. However, sensitization to the major foods, such as fish, egg, and milk, was uncommon (<1%). The incidence and prevalence of allergy to specific foods have been studied.

In contrast, data from U.K. general practices were used to estimate a prevalence rate of peanut allergy of 0.05%, and a school-based survey in Singapore and the Philippines estimated a prevalence rate of peanut and tree nut allergy of less than 1%. 66 In Australia, the prevalence of peanut allergy may be higher than that observed in the United States or United Kingdom, because the prevalence of peanut allergy among 1-year-old children was estimated to be 3%. 58 There is limited information about the epidemiology of allergic gastrointestinal diseases.

In cross-sectional surveys, this pattern of disease is indistinguishable from a decline in disease with age. In the ECRHS, there was almost no net change in the prevalence of sensitization over the 8 years between the surveys within any birth cohort, but succeeding birth cohorts had increasingly high prevalence rates.

However, aggregation among related individuals may represent shared genes or a common household environment. Evidence of a hereditary component of asthma has been demonstrated in numerous family-based studies. [101] [102] [103] [104] Population-based studies also have shown an increased prevalence of asthma among first-degree relatives of index cases. [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] Twin studies compared disease frequency in monozygotic (MZ) twins, who share 100% of their genes, with dizygotic (DZ) twins, who share on average 50% of their genes. This is another method to determine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors. A greater occurrence of disease in MZ than in DZ twins is evidence for a genetic component to the disease because both types of twins are assumed to share environmental factors similarly. Significantly higher concordance rates for MZ twins have been observed in some small studies. 110 Larger studies of twin registries also suggest a significant genetic contribution to asthma. In 6996 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry, Edfors-Lubs found the prevalence of asthma to be 3.8%. 111 The higher concordance of asthma in MZ (19.8%) over DZ (4.8%) pairs suggests that genetic factors contribute to asthma. Similarly, Duffy and associates observed a 30% concordance in MZ twins and 12% in DZ twins in a total of 2902 Australian pairs. 112 Whole-genome association studies have identified specific loci associated with clinical asthma. The genes associated with total IgE levels were not strongly associated with asthma, and Many related methodologic issues complicate the study of diet and disease. 134 Obtaining unbiased exposure estimates is difficult because of recall problems, difficulties in measuring intake, and limited range of variation in the Western diet. 135 Diet is fundamental to existence and is closely associated with many lifestyle, social, cultural, and environmental factors that may influence the development of disease. Although many studies adjust for potential confounders, it has been argued that this is insufficient and that many or all of the reported associations between diet and disease are likely to be confounded by social and behavioral factors acting across the life course. 136, 137 Several reviews on the topic of diet and asthma and allergic disease are available. [138] [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] Observational and randomized studies have directly correlated dietary sodium levels with increased bronchial responsiveness to histamine challenge. [145] [146] [147] One study showed this response occurred in males but not in females. 146 Ecologic data from England and Wales support these experimental findings; the purchases of table salt correlated with the regions of increased asthma mortality for men and children. 131 Other population-based studies, however, have not shown a relationship between urinary sodium levels and methacholine airway responsiveness, [148] [149] [150] although two did show an association with higher levels of potassium excretion. 148, 150 Britton and associates 151 found that increased magnesium intake was associated with a reduced risk of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and wheeze. Because of the relationships among sodium, potassium, and magnesium, these investigators suggest the possibility that low levels of dietary magnesium may confound the association of sodium and potassium with bronchial hyperresponsiveness or asthma. 151 A systematic review of the clinical trials of dietary sodium reduction in persons with asthma concluded that dietary sodium reduction does not significantly improve asthma control. 152 Dietary sodium reduction was associated with some improvement in lung function in people with exercise-induced asthma, but because extremely large reductions in sodium intake were required, the clinical utility, as distinct from the potential public health relevance of this finding, is likely to be small.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 488, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 489, "end": 494, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 495, "end": 500, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 501, "end": 506, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 627, "end": 632, "text": "[105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 633, "end": 638, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 639, "end": 644, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 645, "end": 650, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 651, "end": 656, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1208, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1411, "text": "111", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1663, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1927, "text": "134", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2096, "text": "135", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 2536, "end": 2540, "text": "136,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2541, "end": 2544, "text": "137", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2634, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2640, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2641, "end": 2646, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 2647, "end": 2652, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2658, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2664, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 2665, "end": 2670, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2824, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 2825, "end": 2830, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2836, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2909, "text": "146", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 3092, "end": 3095, "text": "131", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 3237, "end": 3242, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 3243, "end": 3248, "text": "[149]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 3249, "end": 3254, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 3335, "end": 3339, "text": "148,", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 3340, "end": 3343, "text": "150", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 3367, "end": 3370, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 3738, "end": 3741, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 3923, "end": 3926, "text": "152", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetic and Familial Factors"}, {"text": "A systematic review of the studies correlating asthma and allergic disease in children with dietary intake or status of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc, copper, iron, fruits, vegetables, and components of the Mediterranean diet identified 62 eligible reports. 138 There were no randomized, controlled trials, and all studies were judged to be at moderate to substantial risk of bias. Meta-analyses demonstrated that serum vitamin A was lower in children with asthma compared with controls (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10 to 0.40). The meta-analyses also showed that high maternal dietary vitamin E intake during pregnancy was protective against development of childhood wheezing (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88) and that maternal adherence to a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy was protective against persistent wheeze (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.58) and atopy (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.97) in children. Seventeen of 22 fruit and vegetable studies reported beneficial associations with asthma and allergic outcomes. Although weak, the available epidemiologic evidence supports dietary intake of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, fruits, vegetables, and a Mediterranean diet for the prevention of asthma. 138 The fatty acid composition of the diet, particularly the relative amounts of n-3 (\u03c9-3) and n-6 (\u03c9-6) polyunsaturated fatty diagnosis of hay fever in a population sample from western Pennsylvania showed atopy to be more common in asthmatic than nonasthmatic children. 126 Two other studies demonstrated parental atopy and asthma as risk factors for asthma in their children. 127, 128 The results also demonstrated a complex interaction between these factors and the gender of the child. A study of 525 New Zealand children assessed the relationship of total serum IgE levels at the age 11 years and asthma, and investigators found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was strongly related to the serum IgE level (P trend < .0001). 129, 130 Asthma was not reported for children with IgE levels of less than 32 IU/ mL, whereas 36% of children with IgE levels of 1000 IU/mL or higher had asthma.

A systematic review and metaanalysis of the longitudinal studies relating maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy to childhood outcomes concluded that high maternal dietary vitamin D intake is associated with a reduced risk of children wheezing up to the age of 5 years (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.73). 138 However, maternal dietary vitamin D intake during pregnancy is not indicative of total body vitamin D status, because 90% of vitamin D is derived from cutaneous exposure to ultraviolet light. In contrast to maternal dietary vitamin D intake, high (>75 nmol/L) maternal serum 25-OH-D levels in late pregnancy have been associated with an increased likelihood of childhood eczema at age 9 months and asthma at age 9 years. 172 During infancy, increased vitamin D intake has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis at age 6 years and an increased likelihood of allergic rhinitis and atopic sensitization at the age of 31 years. 173, 174 In later childhood, an increased serum 25-OH-D concentration at 4 years of age has been associated with a reduced likelihood of asthma at 8 years of age, 175 and an increased serum 25-OH-D concentration at 6 years of age has been associated with a reduced likelihood of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and atopic sensitization at 14 years of age. 176 The epidemiologic data support the hypotheses that vitamin D may have beneficial and adverse influences on the development of asthma and allergic disease.

However, breastfeeding may also be a route of exposure to a variety of immunologically active substances from the mother, such as tobacco smoke, cow's milk, eggs, wheat, maternal IgE, and sensitized lymphocytes. 135 Many studies have investigated the association between breastfeeding, asthma, wheezing illness, and atopic disease, and they have been subject to several systematic reviews, most of which highlight the limitations and difficulties in conducting and interpreting such studies (e.g., confounding, recruitment bias, reporting bias, reverse causation, variation in breastfeeding patterns, inability to randomize and blind). The systematic reviews have themselves been reviewed in consensus documents, which conclude that the exclusive breastfeeding for 3 to 4 months of acids (PUFAs) found in fish and vegetable oils, respectively, 153 affects cell functioning.

A systematic review of similar literature for children and adolescents concluded that obesity precedes and is associated with the persistence and intensity of asthma symptoms. 191 In observational designs, a potential methodologic concern is that nonspecific respiratory symptoms resulting from cardiorespiratory loading and deconditioning may be misclassified as asthma. Careful studies of children and adults suggest that asthma is not inappropriately overdiagnosed in the obese. 192, 193 Observational studies have also reported adverse associations for BMI, obesity and overweight, and atopic dermatitis and atopic sensitization in children and adults.

Camargo and colleagues offered one of the first reports in their 1999 paper based on the Nurses' Health Study II. 187 The body mass index (BMI) in 1991 was positively and strongly associated with asthma risk over the next few years (Fig. 48-13) . 188 Similar studies have addressed obesity and asthma in children. In a cross-sectional study using NHANES III data, von Mutius and colleagues 188 found a positive association between BMI and asthma risk (OR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.44 to 2.19) by comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of BMI.

No association was observed for children with atopy type 16 (HRV-16) replicates more readily in the airway epithelial cells of people with asthma, and the airway epithelial cells are more likely to lyse and have greatly impaired interferon-\u03bb (IFN-\u03bb) and IFN-\u03b2 responses.

In a prospective, population-based study of 1052 children younger than 5 years of age who were hospitalized in two U.S. counties with acute respiratory illness or fever, HRV was detected in 16%, and HRV-C was isolated slightly more than 50% of them. Children from whom HRV-C was isolated were significantly more likely than those with HRV-A or HRV-B to have underlying high-risk conditions such as asthma (OR = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.23). 220 In Australia, HRV serotypes were isolated from 88% of 128 children 2 to 16 years old who presented to the hospital with acute asthma. HRV-C was isolated from 59% of the children, and these children had higher asthma severity scores than those infected with HRV-A or HRV-B. 221 In a study of children hospitalized in Hong Kong, HRVs were isolated from 85% of 128 children admitted because of acute asthma and from 33% of 192 control, nonatopic children hospitalized with nonasthma respiratory conditions. 222 HRV-C was isolated from 70% of the children with acute asthma and 19% of the controls, and children with HRV-C were more likely to require supplemental oxygen. These studies implicate HRV-C in most episodes of acute asthma requiring hospital attention. HRV-C appears to be more virulent than other HRV serotypes, particularly in children with atopic sensitization. 223 Although the major focus has been on viral respiratory tract infection, asymptomatic early-life bacterial airway colonization has also been associated with childhood wheeze and asthma. 224 In the Copenhagen prospective Study of Asthma in Childhood, 321 neonates at high familial risk for asthma had their hypopharyngeal regions sampled at 1 month of age, and the children were then followed up to 5 years of age. Neonatal colonization of the hypopharyngeal region by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (but not Staphylococcus aureus) in isolation or in combination was associated with increased likelihood of subsequent wheeze, hospitalization with wheeze, and asthma. Hypopharyngeal colonization at 1 year of age was not associated with neonatal colonization or the development of wheeze or asthma. Although has been postulated that early-life bacterial colonization induced neutrophilic airway inflammation with consequent wheeze and asthma, it also has been suggested that neonatal airway colonization by these bacteria reflects defective early-life innate immune responses that predispose to asthma. 225 Asthma-like symptoms, especially in young children, often are treated with antibiotics, and an association has been observed between the use of these drugs and the risk of asthma.

They found that most subjects with a history of BPD in infancy had pulmonary dysfunction. Moreover, the increase in airway reactivity was not associated with a more frequent family history of asthma in this sample or with an increased prevalence of atopy. These findings suggest that lung injury resulting from mechanical ventilation of premature infants has a role in the pathogenesis of persistent pulmonary dysfunction that is similar to asthma. Bertrand and associates 236 investigated the role of RDS in prematurity in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in subjects who did not have BPD as infants. The group with a history of RDS had evidence of more hyperinflation and airway obstruction compared with controls. However, results from the histamine challenge to determine AHR and familial aggregation of AHR were inconclusive. The incidence of airway reactivity was elevated among cases and controls and among the mothers and siblings of cases and controls. The investigators suggest that the elevated incidence of AHR among mothers of both groups supports the hypothesis that there may be an association between the onset of premature labor and airway reactivity. Because no comparison group was established for mothers of term children, however, this assertion cannot be affirmed from the study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 584, "end": 589, "text": "[216]", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 590, "end": 595, "text": "[217]", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 596, "end": 601, "text": "[218]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1792, "text": "236", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Respiratory Infection"}, {"text": "Some researchers have investigated the effect of very low birth weight (VLBW < 1501 g) and BPD on asthma development in birth cohorts.
