The plant is hygrophilous and shade enduring when young. It is well adapted to warm and humid conditions. Optimum average temperature varies between 20 and 23 \u00b0C, the rainfall ranges from 1800 to 2600 mm every year.

The methanol extract of C barometz rhizome exhibited effective antioxidant activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC 50 values of 44.2, 19.84, 137.66, 22.94, 289.73, 53 .52 \u03bcg/mL for DPPH\u2022, ABTS\u2022 + , super anion \u2022O 2 \u2212 , hydroxyl \u2022OH scavenging assays, Fe 3+ reducing power, Cu 2 + reducing power assays, respectively (Mai et al. 2012 ). Its total phenolic content was 50.88 mg CAE (caffeic acid equivalent)/g and the caffeic acid content (the major contributing compound) was 1.82 mg/g. Three rhizome compounds 1-O -caffeyl-Dglucopyranose, 3-O -caffeyl-D -glucopyranose compound 3 and cibotiumbaroside A showed signifi cant DPPH antioxidant activity, and the scavenging activity of 1-O -caffeyl-Dglucopyranose was similar to that of vitamin C (Xu et al. 2012b ) .

The IC 50 value for DPPH radical scavenging assay was 0.25 mg/mL and 1542 mg ascorbic acid/100 g and ferric reducing power was 804 mg GAe/100 g and its total phenolic content was 1589 mg GAE/100 g.

It is widely used to cure rheumatism, limb-ache, lumbago, neuralgia and pollakiuria in aged humans, leucorrhoea, sciatica, micturition, enuresis and body-ache in pregnant women. The golden hair covering the rhizome is used for styptic for poulticing the wounds and cuts in the limbs to stop bleeding in Peninsular Malaysia and China (Burkill 1966 ) (Plate 2 ).
