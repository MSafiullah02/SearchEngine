[1] [2] [3] [4] This barrier enclosure method has been widely promoted in the popular media. 5, 6 While there is a need for innovation, it remains important to fully assess new concepts to ensure their fitness for purpose. To date, the intubation box has only been tested using a vertical cough model using a Sim-man 1 mannikin (manufacturer, location). We subjected such a box to both objective airflow analysis of its performance with a human volunteer (more relevant to how it would be deployed clinically). We also collated perspectives from potential users in anaesthesia.",

This could be eliminated by placement of a drape over this open side of the box such that, on repeat assessment, no airflow escaped the enclosure on that side. The analysis also identified some movement of air out of the box via the holes on the user side during deep exhalation by the volunteer but not during coughing.",

Since the onset of the pandemic in Ireland, we have performed intubation only on patients under full neuromuscular blockade such that coughing is prevented at tracheal intubation. Tracheal extubation is done slowly and carefully under a simple plastic covering placed over the patient's face. The box was considered to create new complexity around procedures that ideally should be done quickly. There was also concern that the box would concentrate infectious material confined within the box bringing added risk at the time of glove doffing and box cleaning.",

Although our imaging method does not measure droplet movement per se, it does show the air currents that carry particles. Our test method is closer to real-world conditions then previous methods used. The airflow dynamics associated with airway interventions (especially with infected patients and with positioning involving greater neck flexion 8 ) are likely to be greater in magnitude and more variable in direction than with our healthy volunteer. Aside from rigid boxes and other solutions, there are other barrier constructs available commercially that more fully enclose the patient's head and upper torso (e.g. Aerosolshield, Campbell Hill Ltd, city, UK). Disposable systems eliminate the need for cleaning and storage for reuse, an advantage for contagious patients. However all designs compromise movements of the healthcare provider such that specific training is likely needed. [9] [10] [11] ",

A high speed monochromatic camera (Phantom v311 capable of 10,000 image s -1 frame rate with 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, courtesy of Bell Labs, location) was used to capture images and allow analysis.
