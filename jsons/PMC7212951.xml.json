            "text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, a single stranded RNA betacoronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China in December, 2019[1]. Like all human coronaviruses, this virus almost certainly originated in bats and spread to humans via an animal, in this case possibly the pangalon[2] at a live animal market. Four other coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) circulate worldwide year-round but with increased case numbers in winter and spring in temperate climates [1]. These four viruses typically cause mild respiratory tract infections in children and adults. Severity is somewhat comparable to rhinovirus infection; paediatric hospitalization is far less common than with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. SARS-CoV-1, presumed to spread to humans from civet cats, circulated in 2003 only with 9% mortality [3]. Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), thought to spread to humans from camels, has circulated primarily in Saudi Arabia since 2012 with a startling 34% mortality rate [3]. The limited circulation of the latter two viruses is presumed to be because asymptomatic or mild infection is rare. Infected people are too ill even early in the course of infection to go out in public so generally infect only household contacts or health care workers (HCWs). Conversely, with SARS-CoV-2, many infected people are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet have a viral load in the upper respiratory tract comparable to that of symptomatic patients [4], [5]. This renders contact tracing problematic, enabling the virus to spread to at least 185 of the 195 countries on the planet by April 28, 2020. It is difficult to determine the effectiveness of school closures, bans on public gatherings, universal use of masks and other public health policies on spread of the virus due to variations in testing algorithms, the date on which SARS-CoV-2 became endemic in a country, the proportion of people already infected when policies were put in place and the level of compliance with these policies.",

Spread of aerosols is usually up to 1 meter but can be further with an unprotected sneeze. A surgical mask (also known as medical or procedure mask) worn properly by either the infected person or by their contacts is highly likely to prevent transmission. Nonetheless, the risk with a universal mask policy is that people are unlikely to consistently comply with the recommendation to wash their hands immediately before donning a mask and after doffing it and may touch their face frequently to scratch under or to adjust their mask. Cloth masks appear to be less effective than surgical masks but this could in part be related to wearing used or wet cloth masks [10].",

Common examples of such procedures are tracheal intubation or extubation, positive pressure ventilation, delivery of medications via nebulisation and high-flow oxygen delivery[15]. The need for N95 masks with these procedures has not been formally studied but tracheal intubation was associated with an increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-1 to HCWs[15]. However, in an early unrecognized case of COVID-19 in Singapore, nosocomial transmission did not occur to 35 HCWs exposed to medical aerosol generating procedures for minimum 10 minutes while wearing only surgical masks[16]. Three of 94 HCWs with medium or high risk exposures to an unrecognized case in the United States (US) became infected but the infected HCWs did not always wear even surgical masks [17].",

The only feature recognized to date was first reported in April 2020[22] and is distal vascular involvement of the toes, fingers or both (See Figure 1, Figure 2\nfor an example in a 2 year old child from Ecuador). A report from Italy characterizes these as chilblain-like lesions and describes 63 cases, primarily in adolescents [23]. Although only 2 of 11 tested had COVID-19 detected, lesions started a median of 10 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms so virus may have cleared by the time of testing. Another report from Italy describes 14 cases (11 in children) seen during the CVOID-19 outbreak; 3 NP and 2 rectal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2[24]. There is increasing evidence that thrombosis may play a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 which could explain this unusual manifestation in digits [25]. In terms of other cutaneous features, active surveillance in 88 patients in Italy (presumably all adults) with no recent drug exposure found that14 had a generalized erythematous viral rash, 3 had urticaria and one had vesicles[26]. In another report from Italy, 2 of 130 inpatients had vesicles [27]. Five of 103 inpatient adults in France had cutaneous manifestations (2 erythematous rashes, 2 urticarial rashes and herpes stomatitis)[28]. In areas where SARS-CoV 2 co-circulates with dengue, a petechial rash from COVID-19 has led to diagnostic confusion. [29]\n",

This figure is difficult to interpret given the inconsistency in the indications for testing children. Understandably, early in the epidemic most children with CVOID-19 were admitted to hospital given the severity of disease in adults. However, by the time that the virus became endemic in the US in March 2020, it was apparent that most children could be safely cared for at home and only 147 of the first 745 US pediatric cases with known hospitalization status were admitted (20%) of which 15 (2% of all cases and 10% of those admitted) went to the intensive care unit[21] and 3 died (0.4% of all cases and 2% of those admitted).

The yield appears to be higher from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens than from upper respiratory samples[42], but lower tract specimens are only available from intubated patients. It seems plausible that the viral load is higher in the upper respiratory tract early in the course of disease, but with pneumonia will eventually be higher in the lower tract. It is impossible to establish the true sensitivity of the many available molecular assays as there is no reference standard and NP specimens may be obtained incorrectly. The accuracy of diagnosis would be even more important were there an effective treatment.

The anti-viral agent thought to hold the most promise is remdesivir [46], an RNA polymerase inhibitor with in-vitro activity against MERS [47]. This drug has been studied for Ebola virus disease but appears to be less promising than other options [48]. The largest study to date described a 68% response rate but lacked a control group so is impossible to interpret [49]. Lopinavir-ritonavir is a protease inhibitor with extensive use as an antiretroviral agent, but did not suppress viral replication in the initial randomized controlled trial [50]. However, treatment was started on median day 13 of symptoms which may be too late to procure benefit so further trials are ongoing. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used for decades for malaria and for rheumatologic conditions. They inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by an unknown mechanism so could be effective for prophylaxis or for treatment. Trials to date are not definitive as they are small with a high risk of bias, sometimes using monotherapy and sometimes adding azithromycin (for unclear reasons) [51]. Because end-stage COVID-19 is reminiscent of a hyper-inflammatory state with cytokine storm, the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is being studied. A detailed summary of medications for treatment of SARS-Cov-2 compiled by pharmacists and paediatric infectious diseases physicians in North America was published April 2020[46]. In keeping with the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for adults[52], they recommended that none of these medications be used outside of clinical trials. Given the absence of effective medications, convalescent plasma warrants study [53].",

This should be taken into account when determining whether to use non-invasive ventilation, high PEEP and prone positioning[54].

            "text": "The future evolution of this pandemic is of interest to every person alive today. The following all seem possible in any given country:1.There is only ever one wave of COVID-19. Based on the R0, this would require that an estimated 82% of people are infected during the first wave[6], leading to herd immunity such that spread is minimal if the virus is reintroduced. However, perhaps this estimate will prove to be incorrect and most countries will only ever see one wave despite achieving a lower level of herd immunity. A single wave is reminiscent of what happened when Zika virus reached the Americas in 2015, differences being that an estimated 80% of Zika virus infections are asymptomatic and Zika virus requires a mosquito to spread person-to-person.2.There are repeated waves of COVID-19 until herd immunity develops.3.We learn that reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or a mutated version is common so COVID-19 becomes endemic (like 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 have done). It is difficult to predict whether infection will occur year round (but more commonly in the winter and spring) as with these other coronaviruses or seasonally (as with RSV and influenza). The severity of infection with RSV and influenza is higher in infants and in the elderly. One might predict the same pattern with COVID-19 but it is striking to what a degree infants have been spared from severe disease in the first wave.4.There are repeated waves of COVID19 until an effective vaccine is employed. Although experts suggest that there may be a vaccine during 2021, this seems optimistic given that the first study of an RSV vaccine ended in 1966[56], yet there is still no licensed vaccine. After decades of development, influenza vaccines have only about 50% efficacy in recent years. However, we would readily adopt a well-tolerated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with 50% efficacy given the havoc the virus is wreaking worldwide.\n",
