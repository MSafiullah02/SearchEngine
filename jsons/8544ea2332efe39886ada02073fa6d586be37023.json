In patients with RV dysfunction, CIT raises significant suspicion for PE. While TEE is not the modality of choice for the diagnosis of PE, our imaging modalities were limited and TEE was further used to characterize chamber size and function to assist with the diagnosis. TEE can be instrumental in differentiating suspected CIT from other structures such as a Chiari network, Eustachian valve, or intracardiac tumors [12] . Optimal therapy for CIT is not defined as most data are based on case-series or registry results. However, meta-analysis data suggest superior results with thrombolytic therapy in these patients compared to alternative treatment modalities such as systemic anticoagulation or surgical embolectomy [13] . Our patient was hemodynamically unstable with a presumed diagnosis of PE, treatment with tPA was indicated. In general, thrombolytic therapy has been reported to lead to complete dissolution of CIT in <2 hours in 50% of cases while the remaining reach full resolution within 24 hours of treatment [14] . In an analysis of 177 patients with CIT, the mortality rate was 11.3% among patients receiving thrombolytics compared to 27.1% among the entire cohort treated with other therapeutic modalities such as heparin or surgical embolectomy [13] . We hypothesize the rapid deterioration and death of our patient was related to recurrent PE or acute hypoxemia related to ARDS.",
