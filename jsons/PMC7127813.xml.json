The RNAi is triggered by degradation of single\u2010stranded RNAs of identical sequences. Therefore, RNAi technology can be used to silence gene expression by directly targeting its specific sequence of mRNA. Beside the widely used strategies for knocking down gene expression in academic research, RNAi technology, generated by small interfering RNAi (siRNA), has been used in therapeutic studies of human diseases including cancer, neurogenerative diseases and viral infectious diseases (reviewed in [14]).",

Using poliovirus as a model, Gitlin et al. [17] demonstrated that siRNA could effectively protect human cells against infection by a rapidly replicating and highly cytolytic RNA virus. Hu et al. [18] reported that siRNA could block retroviral infection in chick embryos and inhibit the growth of the Rous sarcoma virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in cell culture. They found that the siRNA primarily prevented accumulation of the viral RNAs synthesized in the late stage of the infection, but did not degrade the RNA genome in the virus in the early stage of the infection. Other groups reported that siRNA could specifically inhibit HIV\u20101 replication and virus propagation [19] through targeting major genes in the HIV life cycle, including p24 (the HIV long terminal repeat) [20, 21], vif, nef [19], tat and rev [22, 23].",

To show the specificity of the siRNA targeting, we used EGFP as a control. From the data, it was clearly demonstrated that pBS/U6/EGFP\u2010RNAi could specifically silence the expression of EGFP protein in cells (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lane 2). However, pBS/U6/S\u2010RNAi1, pBS/U6/S\u2010RNAi2 or the vector alone (pBS/U6) had no effect on EGFP expression (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 1, 3 and 4). Interestingly, both pBS/U6/S\u2010RNAi1 and pBS/U6/S\u2010RNAi2 could specifically impair the expression of Spike protein in cultured cells (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 3 and 4), while pBS/U6/EGFP\u2010RNAi or the vector did not (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 1 and 2).

In an attempt to prevent and inhibit SARS\u2010CoV replication, we employed RNAi technology, which has been used to silence virus gene expression in HIV and HCV/HBV. In this paper, we provide evidence that a DNA vector\u2010based siRNA could effectively and specifically inhibit gene expression of the Spike protein from SARS\u2010CoV. Initially, we showed that siRNAs silenced the expression of Spike protein in cells transfected with S gene expression vector. Both Western blot and immunostaining experiments consistently suggested that the DNA vectors carrying the siRNA hairpin targeted the overexpressed S gene in cells. We also showed that the mRNA level was decreased when siRNAs were transfected into the cells. This model system demonstrated the inhibition of gene expression of the virus as in the case of inhibition of HIV and HCV/HBV [18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33].",

In this report we used the recombinant Spike protein cDNA from the SARS\u2010CoV genome and expressed the protein in 293T cells. The molecular weight of the expressed HA\u2010tagged protein was smaller than the predicted one, suggesting the modification of Spike protein in mammalian cells.
