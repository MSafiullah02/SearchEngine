Of the 1,304 pediatric lung transplants performed from 1990 to 2009, 758 (58 %) were in patients with cystic fibrosis [1]. The decision of when to proceed with transplantation is important, since the current median survival time after transplant is 4.6 years [1], and complications related to transplantation are the second leading cause of death in patients with cystic fibrosis [2]. Several studies have looked to provide physicians guidance in this regard. Karem et al. from the Toronto lung transplant program looked at factors that predicted less than 50 % survival in 2 years [3]. They concluded that patients with an FEV1 of less than 30 % should be considered for lung transplantation. Robinson [4] suggested that referral should be made for children who have an FEV1 less than 50 % despite aggressive treatment. Others have found that the rate of decline in the FEV1 may be more predictive of survival than the absolute percentage, and have recommended patients be referred for transplantation when the expected time for their FEV1 to be less than 20 % of predicted equals the average waiting time for donor lungs [5].",

Lung transplantation in this group of patients is available only if left ventricular function is normal. If left ventricular function is poor, heart-lung transplantation may be required. Right heart function is frequently poor in this group of patients, but frequently returns to normal within a short period of time following transplantation [3].",

Stenting and dilation of stenotic veins many provide palliation for some time, but it is recommended that these patients be referred for transplant early. The clinical course of patients with pulmonary hypertension following repair of congenital heart disease is similar to that of patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.

The most common causes of respiratory failure following treatment for malignancies include pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans. The course of pulmonary fibrosis is highly variable, with some patients having complete resolution following removal of the chemotherapeutic agent, and others progressing to severe respiratory failure [15]. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) following bone marrow transplantation is nearly always associated with graft vs. host disease [16], with a 65 % mortality rate at 3 years post-diagnosis [17].

In some cases, it remains the only viable option for patients who develop graft failure and BO. Since the survival rates are lower and there are a limited number of donor organs available, patient selection is important. In a recent retrospective study of lung re-transplantation, Scully et al. found that patients who were less than a year post-transplant had worse graft survival, and therefore may not be the best candidates for re-transplantation [21]. Patients who were greater than 1 year post-transplant had similar morbidity and mortality to patients undergoing their first transplant. Further research is needed in this area to determine other factors, if any, that may help refine patient selection to maximize outcomes.",

Protective isolation is generally practiced although there are no data to support this. Nonetheless, common sense dictates that health care workers should be particularly cautious in preventing transmitted infections. Many of these patients, particularly those with cystic fibrosis will have multi-resistant organisms necessitating isolation precautions anyway. Hemodynamic monitoring is usually with only central venous pressure line and an arterial line. More invasive monitoring lines such as a Swan-Ganz catheter are generally not necessary and are particularly difficult to manage in small children. Fluid management is of great importance, and a negative fluid balance is the goal within the first 48 h post transplant, given that there is evidence that the newly transplanted lungs are susceptible to the development of pulmonary edema. In a retrospective study in adult lung transplant recipients, a central venous pressure of greater than 7 mmHg was found to be associated with a higher hospital mortality rate and longer intensive care unit stays [26]. However, the need to maintain a negative fluid balance needs to be balanced with the fact that over diuresis places the patient at risk for relatively low cardiac output and renal insufficiency. Generally speaking, these patients do not have very much difficulty with hemodynamic instability. The one exception to this is the group of patients with pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular dysfunction pre-transplant is very common. Although right ventricular afterload is significantly improved post-transplant, some instability is common, usually requiring low to moderate doses of inotropic agents. There is one cautionary note about patients with Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome who undergo lung transplantation and repair of the cardiac defect (usually a ventricular septal defect). These patients may have acquired right ventricular outflow tract obstruction post-transplant because of the severe right ventricular hypertrophy that accompanies this disease. This occurs presumably as a consequence of the dynamic nature of the outflow tract muscle. At the time of transplantation it is advisable to divide some of the muscle bundles present there and post-operatively avoid high dose inotropic agents.",

The duration of treatment and the route of administration are somewhat controversial. In the absence of need for prophylaxis with ganciclovir, many centers now recommend acyclovir for prophylaxis against herpes simplex infections. The presence of CMV infection, or the detection of the virus in serum or BAL specimens, usually responds to a 14\u201321 day course of IV ganciclovir.

Treatment depends on the organism identified and the sensitivity patterns. For Candida albicans, treatment with fluconazole is generally effective.

PGD generally occurs within the first 24 h after transplantation, with a clinical picture similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In attempts to consistently describe the severity of PGD, a grading system was proposed from the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation in 2005. This classification grades the severity of PGD from 0 to 3 based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the presence or absence of radiographic abnormalities. Absence of infiltrates on chest radiographs (CXR) is rated as grade 0 regardless of PaO2/FiO2 ratio. If this ratio is greater than 300, but there are infiltrates on the CXR, it is grade 1. Grade 2 includes PaO2/FiO2 between 200 and 300 with CXR abnormalities, and Grade 3 has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. Any patient on extracorporeal oxygenation is classified as grade 3 [42]. The practical utility of this classification system is marginal in part because of the changing nature of blood gases and chest radiographic findings in the first 48 h post-transplant.",

It is a pathologic process characterized by partial or complete obstruction and destruction of distal airways. Several risk factors have been identified in the development of BO following lung transplantation, including recurrent episodes of acute cellular rejection, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and viral infections. Regardless of the underlying cause of BO, the prognosis is poor. Several studies have found the 3-year survival of patients with BO to be about 51 % [67\u201369]. Treatment plans for post-transplant BO are variable, but usually includes altering immunosuppression, either by changing agents or adding additional agents. There is evidence that changing from cyclosporine to tacrolimus [70, 71], or adding either mycophenolate mofetil [72] or sirolimus [73] to the current immunosuppressive regime may be helpful. Other therapies, such as extracorporeal photopheresis, have been used with variable results [74, 75]. Still other medications, such as azithromycin, which has anti-inflammatory effects [76] and clotrimazole, which may decrease the proliferation of fibroblasts [64], have not had formal clinical trials to evaluate effectiveness in treating BO. In many cases, re-transplantation is a strong consideration.",
