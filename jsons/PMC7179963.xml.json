The large particles to which they refer remain airborne only briefly before settling because of gravity; these particles may pose a threat of infection if they are inhaled by persons close by as well as a contact hazard if they are transferred to another person\u2019s nasal or oral passages. In this way, persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may contribute to the spread of the infection.",

The diameters of these particles are in the micron range. These particles are too small to settle because of gravity, but they are carried by air currents and dispersed by diffusion and air turbulence.",

In contrast, inhaled aerosolized particles can penetrate to the depths of the lungs, where they may be deposited in the alveoli.",

The possible contribution of infective aerosols to the current pandemic suggests the advisability of wearing a suitable mask whenever it is thought that infected persons may be nearby and of providing adequate ventilation of enclosed spaces where such persons are known to be or may recently have been.",
