(1) This rapid surge in the number of cases imposed a major burden on all hospitals in NYC, as well as a significant stress in Emergency Departments (ED). In addition, public health messages promoting social distancing and news reports focused on the death toll associated with COVID-19 have created a sense of generalized anxiety in society. Changes in the observed incidence of acute cardiovascular conditions have been anecdotally reported, including the occurrence of STelevation myocardial infarctions 2 . Incidentally, the number of at-home deaths in NYC have reached an 8-to 10-fold increase compared to the same time period in 2019, raising concerns about the impact of the pandemic on non-COVID related health conditions. Acute type A aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition for which the only effective treatment requires a surgical intervention and the portal to initial diagnosis is invariably the ED.",

No change in the management of acute type A aortic dissections was reported by any of the centers. All patients with acute type A aortic dissection in NYC underwent emergent open repair. Univariable linear regression was used to calculate the estimated decrease in monthly procedural volumes between before-COVID and after-COVID.

Low volumes in 2 consecutive months (March and April, 2020) further confirms the unusual nature of the observation. Given the known seasonal effect with a higher incidence of dissections during the winter months (3), analysis of the volumes in the 4 months (January to April) of the last 3 years further confirmed the unusually low volumes after-COVID. While no causal relationship can be firmly established between the drop in type A aortic dissections, the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC and the increase in at-home deaths since the last week of March, 2020, this gives pause for thought. A number of hypotheses may explain this observation including patient fear of contracting COVID-19 if presenting to the ED, overstretched first responders causing undue delays, overburdened EDs causing delayed or missed diagnoses. Importantly, this raises important public health concerns about the unintended consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical, as we adjust to the pandemic, to balance the public health imperative of social distancing with the individual need to consult in the presence of sudden severe symptoms. Furthermore, additional resources ranging from telemedicine to increased first responders should be greatly increased. This serves as a word of Figure Legend",
