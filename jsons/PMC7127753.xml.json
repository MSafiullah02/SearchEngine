            "text": "The primary source of human MERS-CoV infections remains unknown. There are no definitive data on the epidemiologic link between human MERS-CoV infections and bats. Only one fragment of MERS-CoV with close matching to a human isolate of MERS-CoV was found in a study of more than 1000 samples from Taphozous bats.19 Phylogenetic analysis of an MERS-related CoV identified from a Neoromicia capensis bat sampled in South Africa supports the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV but not a zoonotic reservoir.20 To date, no sustained human-to-human transmission has been documented, although tertiary and quaternary spread did occur in the Korean outbreak.8, 9\n",

Risk factors for MERS-CoV infection among camel workers include milking camels, contact with camel waste, poor hand hygiene before and after animal tasks and training activities, and workers with respiratory symptoms requiring overnight stay in hospital.21 Viral RNA sequencing has confirmed camel to human transmission of MERS-CoV22, 23, 24 after known exposure to the infected camels. Recent data suggest that although MERS-CoV is widespread among dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa, zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans is relatively uncommon, and human disease is not directly proportional to potential exposure. MERS-CoV does not transmit easily from person-to-person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient in the household25 or nosocomial setting when the diagnosis of MERS-CoV has not yet been recognized and there are lapses in instituting infection control measures.2, 3, 6, 7\n",

The clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infections range from asymptomatic infection to mild, moderate, and severe disease, often complicated by severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiorgan failure. The incubation period is between 2 and 14 days. Mild cases can have low-grade fever, chills, runny nose, dry cough, sore throat, and myalgia. Some patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Fever may be absent in up to 15% of hospitalized cases. Laboratory abnormalities include cytopenias and elevated transaminases (see Table 1). Coinfections with other respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens have been reported.

Droplet precaution (wearing a surgical mask within 1 m of the patient) and contact and droplet precautions (wearing gown, gloves, mask, and eye protection on entering the room and removing them on leaving) must be used when caring for patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection.46 HCWs should implement airborne precautions and wear a fit-tested particulate respirator (eg, The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\u2013approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator [FFR] or an European norms [EN] approved FFP2-FFR or FFP3-FFR) when performing aerosol-generating procedures for infected and potentially infected patients. Avoiding aerosolizing procedures in crowded hospital emergency or inpatient medical wards that do not have adequate infection control measures in place may decrease MERS-CoV human-to-human spread and environmental contamination. It is also prudent to use higher levels of protection for HCWs who extend close contact with patients with MERS and those who are exposed to aerosols from high-risk procedures.",
