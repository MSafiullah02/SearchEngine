PCR products of four field isolates digested with HgaI generated the same RFLP pattern as that of CV777 and the vaccine virus, whereas nine other field isolates were not digested with HgaI (Fig. 2b). Digestion with MspR9I generated five different RFLP patterns (Fig. 2c). The PCR products of all 13 field isolates digested with Tru9I generated a distinct RFLP pattern compared to that of CV777 and the vaccine strain (Fig. 2d).
