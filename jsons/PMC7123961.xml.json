The market is expected to grow up to 6% in emerging markets in the next years (Global Industrial Enzymes Markets, seventh Edition, Marketresearch.com). The largest segment of industrial enzyme application is food and beverage, amounting to approx. 2 billion USD in 2016, depending on the source (Patel et al. 2016; Chapman et al. 2018). Higher personal spending in developing countries will lead to growth in sales of higher-value products containing or manufactured with enzymes. Market trends also indicate growth in the use of technical enzymes (textile, paper, biodiesel, biofuel) where waste generation using chemicals will be penalized by environmental agencies (Chapman et al. 2018).",

These conditions are responsible for the flavor and color in toasted, fried, or baked starchy products. Acrylamide is known as a neurotoxin in humans, and it is classified as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and its carcinogenic effect has been recently shown (Zhivagi et al. 2019). Furthermore, it is classified as mutagen by the European Union and added to the list of substances of very high concern by the European Chemical Agency (Palermo et al. 2016). It is formed mainly from free asparagine and reducing sugars during high-temperature processing of common foods. The main sources of dietary exposure are fried potato, bakery products, breakfast cereals, and coffee (Pedreschi et al. 2014). A very effective way to substantially reduce acrylamide formation is to convert asparagine to aspartic acid using asparaginase. The use of asparaginase has been suggested as the best approach to reduce acrylamide in food products (Palermo et al. 2016).",

This results in oil of poor quality while also being problematic in terms of both safety and the environment. Current regulations prohibit manufacturers to use partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) due to the trans-fat content. The World Health Organization launched a program to reduce PHOs and trans fats globally, as their intake is associated to risk for coronary heart disease (Shin et al. 2009). Trans fats are formed when manufacturers use a partial hydrogenation process to give margarines the correct melting properties and shelf stability. The same quality and avoidance of trans fats formation can be obtained using a different process, interesterification. Using enzymatic interesterification gives a more natural, better tasting product that contains healthier oils (Fig. 7.2; see below).\n",

The most common chemical catalyst is still either sodium methylate (methoxide) or sodium ethylate (ethoxylate). These chemicals are both highly toxic and explosive. The chemical reaction causes by-product formation (including color, Fig. 7.2). Therefore, the reaction is followed by washing, bleaching and deodorization. All these are unit operations, which result in yield loss during the process. By-products of chemical interesterification have been identified as dialkyl ketones (Santoro et al. 2018). Differences between the result of interesterification of a fat blend by chemical and enzymatic interesterification are also partly due to the higher level of diglycerides produced in the chemical process and partly because the enzymatic process does not produce full randomization (Holm et al. 2018).",

A simple and robust process for submerged fermentation is typically used (Fig. 7.5). Shortly, a cell bank vial (typically a working cell bank, WCB) is used to inoculate a solid medium to generate sufficient spores to inoculate a medium-size seed tank (seed fermenter). This step enables the generation of suitable fungal biomass optimally without induction of enzyme production. The biomass is used as inoculum for the main tank (5000 L or larger) where induction of enzyme production occurs. Growth of filamentous fungi in a fermenter presents a number of challenges in terms of the morphology, pellet vs. dispersed growth, high viscosity, and transfer of oxygen to the cells compared to, e.g., unicellular, round yeast cells or bacteria. High viscosity typically limits oxygen transfer and result in loss of productivity (enzyme yield). Mycelial morphology during fermentation has an important effect on aeration and productivity (Amanullah et al. 2002). In submerged cultures, the observed macroscopic morphology of filamentous fungi varies from freely dispersed mycelium to dense pellets consisting of a more or less condensed and intertwined network of hyphae. Morphology and productivity are influenced by the environment and can be controlled by inoculum concentration and viability, pH value, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, medium composition, mechanical stress, or process mode as well as through the addition of inorganic salts (Walisko et al. 2015).\n",

The stronger the promoter, the lower the requirement for copy number of the expression cassette to be inserted into the production strain to reach optimal enzyme titers. The advantages of using a regulated promoter include the possibility to design a fermentation process composed of a biomass production phase followed by induction of enzyme production. Strong and regulated promoters can be identified, e.g., looking at relatively abundant enzymes or mRNAs. The great majority of highly expressed genes include those encoding secreted enzymes that are an essential part of the life strategy of fungi, i.e., for degradation of polymers such as cellulose, starch, etc. (Wang et al. 2018; Yoder and Lehmbeck 2004). Examples of promoters that are used in industrial enzyme production include the Trichoderma reesei cbhI promoter (PcbhI), the A. oryzae TAKA amylase (PTAKA; Christensen et al. 1988) and the A. niger neutral amylase, and glucoamylase promoters (PamyB and PglaA). All the above promoters are strong and regulated. Induction is obtained in medium containing cellulose-like substrates like sophorose (PcbhI) or starch, maltose, and maltodextrin (PTAKA, PglaA, or PamyB). They are all subjected to carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and their use may negatively affect productivity as glucose is produced during growth. Many industrial fungal hosts have therefore been mutated in functions regulating CCR. One example is the mutation identified in the cre1 gene in T. reesei strains that produce cellulase during growth in glucose. Cre1 is the major CCR transcription factor that binds to a specific motif present in promoter of genes involved in glucose repression. Introducing the mutation in a production strain increases the enzyme yield without affecting growth (Nakari-Set\u00e4l\u00e4 et al. 2009).",

SES consists of a promoter with a core sequence and of a heterologous transcription factor which binds to repeated activating sequences placed in the promoter (Rantasalo et al. 2018). Other promoters like the Aspergillus tet-on/tet-off system are useful for research purposes rather than for industrial production (Wanka et al. 2016; Kluge et al. 2018).

Since this publication, research has broadened the understanding of secretion in filamentous fungi; however, many reports on attempts to improve \u201csecretion\u201d of a protein have been published, and no broadly successful strategy to manipulate the secretion pathway exists. Therefore, secretion optimization is probably one of the most challenging tasks to increase enzyme yields. Fungi like A. niger and A. oryzae adapt the protein load in the secretory pathway, probably as an evolutionary advantage of their lifestyle in nature. In addition, we continue to learn unique aspects of secretion in fungi as exemplified by recent insights into protein trafficking in A. nidulans. A genetic dissection of the exocytic pathway in A. nidulans has been described. It reveals numerous and yet unexplored cellular functions like Rab1and Sed5 (early Golgi), Sec7 and Trs120 (trans Golgi network), and Rab5 (early endosome) among others (Hernandez-Gonzalez et al. 2018).",

Screening of different known signal peptides to find the most suitable sequence can be performed as described for the yeast Pichia pastoris. Although some signal peptides (e.g., the sequence derived from the yeast mating factor) result in an overall higher yield in yeast, no secretion was obtained using this sequence for other proteins (Obst et al. 2017). Suitable SPs may be obtained by identifying the secreted proteins of a fungal host and selecting the SP of the most abundant ones (Wang et al. 2018), although in vivo screening is needed as theoretical values generated by SignalP (a prediction software for SPs) are not associated with high levels of secretion in yeast (Mori et al. 2015).",

In A. oryzae, more than 130 exo- and endopeptidase genes have been identified (Kobayashi et al. 2007). In Ustilago maydis, the use of proteomics identified 477 proteins in submerged cultivation of which 21 were annotated as proteases or peptidases. Surprisingly, engineered strains in which deletion of major protease genes has been introduced and not displaying detectable protease activity in casein-indicator plates still contained a significant protease activity (Terfr\u00fcchte et al. 2018). As in many other fungi, the arsenal of proteases present in wild-type strains ensures that available protein sources can be degraded under different growth conditions even if loss of function mutations in major protease genes occur. In T. reesei, strains engineered for production of enzymes for biomass degradation, protease levels (e.g., PepM and Asp1) vary depending on growth conditions (Jun et al. 2013; Stappler et al. 2017). Additionally, a strain containing deletions in the seven genes encoding the more predominant proteases was developed, using a combination of inhibitor studies and protease purification, to enable production of biopharmaceuticals in T. reesei (Landowski et al. 2015).",

Some SM display antimicrobial or antioxidant activity and are used as a defense mechanism in nature. These compounds are normally not produced during growth in the laboratory or in large-scale growth in a fermenter. Mycotoxins are a small group of SM representing a health risk for animal and humans. Mycotoxins are acutely or chronically toxic and pose health hazards or death in humans and other vertebrates when acquired in small amounts via a natural route, i.e., orally, by inhalation, or via the skin (Frisvad et al. 2018). Genes responsible for mycotoxin biosynthesis are normally grouped in gene clusters. Although mycotoxin production is not normally associated to submerged growth of pure cultures, the potential for production of these compounds can be eliminated by deletion of the responsible gene cluster resulting in strains with a reduced toxigenic potential. To do this, the genes responsible for production of the mycotoxin need to be identified. In A. oryzae, two neighboring gene clusters involved in the synthesis of cyclopiazonic acid and aflatoxin, respectively, have been removed from the genome in production strains (Christensen et al. 1999; Olempska-Beer et al. 2006). Similarly, genes responsible for production of most relevant fungal mycotoxins like fumonisin and ochratoxin (Khaldi and Wolfe 2011; Gill-Serna et al. 2018) are known, and strains lacking the potential to produce them can be engineered.",

Purity of the product is solely controlled by the level of production of the enzyme product and the concentration of other secreted proteins in the recovered and formulated product. Many of the industrial fungal host species produce one or more secreted enzymes at reasonable titers, i.e., amylase, cellulases, and glucoamylase by A. niger, A. oryzae, and T. reesei. This ability to produce high levels of a secreted enzyme(s) has been exploited both for production of these native enzymes as well as for heterologous enzymes. In strains producing a heterologous enzyme, genes coding for abundant native secreted enzymes are deleted or classical mutants that are unable to produce the native enzymes have been isolated. T. reesei produces a complex set of cellulases and hemicellulases that provides the capability to degrade lignocellulose. Deletion of the most abundant enzyme cellobiohydrolase I (cbh1) gene leads to an increase in production of cellobiohydrolase II (cbh2), whereas deletion of endoglucanase I or endoglucanase II increased levels of both cbh1 and cbh2 (Seiboth et al. 1997).",

RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease can be used to cleave any DNA sequence in a fungal host with high specificity, and repair of the double-strand breaks can be mediated by error-prone, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or by the introduction of specific changes via homologous recombination using donor DNA. In strains deficient in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), highly efficient marker-free gene targeting can be performed. Even single-stranded oligonucleotides work efficiently as repair templates for Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks in different Aspergillus species (N\u00f8dvig et al. 2018). This indicates that this type of repair may be widespread in filamentous fungi. Using oligonucleotides for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing, it is now possible to introduce specific point mutations as well as gene deletions at efficiencies approaching 100%. In A. nidulans, up to three editing events can be achieved in one transformation (N\u00f8dvig et al. 2018).",

Using protein localization tags, beneficial modifications (by engineering the cellular location of the reaction) of the metabolic flux can be obtained (Martins-Santana et al. 2018). In yeast, several organelles (mitochondria, peroxisomes, and even the cell wall) have been redesigned to improve processes such as bioethanol production (Hammer and Avalos 2017).",

            "text": "In the early years of modern biotechnology, production strains were constructed using free replicating plasmids and antibiotic resistance as a dominant selective marker on the plasmid containing the expression cassette for the gene of interest. Although not a strict requirement for technical enzymes, the presence of genes encoding antibiotic resistance imposes additional requirements from regulatory authorities on food and feed enzymes (see Sect. 6). Thus, auxotrophic markers or markers that enable growth in specific nitrogen or carbon sources have been introduced, e.g., the amdS gene (Christensen et al. 1988). Genetic stability issues have also resulted in the scarcity of strains constructed using free replicating plasmid based on, e.g., the Aspergillus AMA1 fragment (Aleksensko and Clutterbuck 1997). Even though transformation frequencies are much lower than for free replicating plasmids, current production strains are therefore constructed using chromosomal integration. Because NHEJ is the dominant mechanism for DNA integration in industrial fungal strains, initially, production strains were the result of ectopic (nonhomologous) integration. The regulatory requirement\u2014determination of the site of integration of the expression cassette\u2014has driven the construction of strains through homologous recombination at one of more defined chromosomal locations. A suitable host strain should harbor multiple and reusable integration loci (i.e., a \u201cplug and play\u201d system) in such a way that newly identified yield improvements can be readily incorporated to produce different enzymes (Udagawa 2017).",

The numbers depict the total number of patent families that originate from the identified priority filing dates. The analysis was performed using broad search terms and patent classification codes. The accuracy of this survey is only 60\u201370% as it was performed using semiautomated techniques and only limited manual review. Data for 2017 cannot be shown as there is an 18-month delay from application to publication date when searches apply",

(a) Traditional methods can be based on the use of homologous recombination using upstream and downstream sequences (\u201cHR\u201d) of the target gene to be deleted (\u201cTarget 1\u201d, \u201cTarget 2\u201d) to flank a selective marker (\u201cmarker\u201d) as indicated. For each target gene, two consecutive steps (1 and 2) are required for integration of the target site (1) and loop out of the marker (2) before a new target gene can be modified using the same selection (3 and 4). (b) Using CRISPR (illustrated with use of the most used Cas9 nuclease, green box), it is feasible to target modification of two or more genes in a single step using gRNAs directed to each target and a plasmid containing suitable expression cassettes for the Cas9 gene and the gRNAs. If the Cas9 expression cassette is introduced on a plasmid containing, e.g., pyrG as the selective marker, subsequent growth of the resulting strains in medium with FOA results in plasmid (Cas9) loss and enables identification of the desired strains. In the depicted example, two target genes are modified in a single step",
