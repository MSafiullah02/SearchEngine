            "text": "1. Active surveillance; this is a system of surveillance that provides the most accurate and well-timed information. It involves individual staff that regularly contact members of the community and collect information regarding health conditions from the communities and/or healthcare providers (Nsubuga et al. 2006) . Active surveillance involves close watch and observation of health conditions, including disease occurrence, deaths and any conditions that are out of the ordinary looking for patterns and linking them to outcomes. Active surveillance requires time and resources. It involves community health workers, working within the communities, supervisors collecting information, managers' supervising and coordinating the process, epidemiologists interpreting the information and healthcare workers in the clinics and hospitals that handle and identify cases. Active surveillance is expensive and is a challenge for most developing countries with limited resources. Active surveillance is essential in early detection of epidemics as an early warning and can be used in epidemic response. 2. Passive surveillance; this is the type of surveillance which depends on reports from health institutions including hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and any health units (Nsubuga et al. 2006 ). This type of surveillance involves filling in forms by healthcare workers and these forms are collected and the data is analysed. Passive surveillance is relatively inexpensive hence it is widely used. This system of surveillance covers large areas and provides information that can assist in determining the health of communities. Routine health information system which involves regular reports on diseases occurring in health institutions by public health staff and health information management system are also part of passive surveillance (Nsubuga et al. 2006 ). 3. Categorical surveillance; this type of surveillance is focussed on, for example a particular disease or groups of diseases, a particular health condition or a behaviour. It can be active or passive form of surveillance but is very involving as health care workers have to fill in more than one form making it tedious and adding more work. It might not be as efficient at the community and district level (Nsubuga et al. 2006 ). 4. Integrated surveillance; this system gathers information on multiple diseases, using both active and passive systems. This surveillance system integrates the categorical disease programmes thereby improving the timelines on data collection as well as data completion. For example, gathering information on infectious diseases through registers kept at hospitals or clinics and or individual staff collecting information in communities (Nsubuga et al. 2006 (Nsubuga et al. , 2010 . 5. Syndromic surveillance; an active and passive system that uses case definitions as well as clinical features as data type. This type of surveillance was the first kind in developing countries where resources are scarce. One would be able to record symptoms that could indicate cases such as diarrhoea, fever, headaches and so on. The challenge of this system is that it is highly unspecific; therefore the common symptoms could mask an underlying emerging disease. Since it does not require laboratory confirmation, syndromic surveillance is fast and inexpensive and easy to adapt in a developing country setting (Nsubuga et al. 2006 ). 6. Behavioural risk factor surveillance; involves surveys that measure behaviours that are known to cause disease, e.g. smoking, alcohol use, risky sexual behaviour and practices and more (Nsubuga et al. 2006 ). This is achieved through active repeated surveys. ",

The villagers believe that some mysterious magical powers and or witchcraft are involved. This continues for the next 5-10 years and the villagers decide to move to another place far from this initial place. There the children grow past the age of two and the mysterious deaths disappear. So why were the children dying in the initial village? If surveillance was carried out and data was collected, the answer would lie in the data. Possibilities include, the surrounding environment, a disease associated with the geographical disposition of the area, could be certain pathogens or toxins that are associated with vegetation in the village or human behaviour associated with the initial village. If surveillance data existed, trends and behavioural patterns could be established that would assist in solving the mystery. Public health surveillance therefore should be designed accordingly to provide accurate and valid information to those in authority so that they can make informed decisions.",

There is need to invest in national surveillance systems that are sustainable, cost effective and inclusive so that the wide population benefits from it. Collaboration of national health surveillance programmes between neighbouring countries and regions could help in infectious disease surveillance. Although there are surveillance networks that have been set up in developed countries, most developing countries are often lagging behind due to lack of resources to support infrastructure and technology required to meet a quality surveillance system. Even though these poor developing countries carry the burden of emerging and neglected infectious diseases that affect billions of people, most are lacking in surveillance. Poor surveillance in developing countries presents a risk of spread of infectious diseases even to countries that have well established surveillance systems. The 2015, Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the SARS and MERS outbreak in Asia are examples of how infectious diseases can easily cross borders and infect people from different backgrounds, and races. It is therefore important that developing countries are able to build surveillance systems that can detect epidemics at an early stage and be able to put in place the necessary steps to prevent further spread of infectious diseases.",

This is a problem shared by most poor developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as other low-income countries globally. Births and deaths that occur in remote villages are rarely reported to civil and health authorities resulting in inaccurate figures. This information is poorly documented and can only be accessed through word of mouth from the community leaders who are the authority and overseers in communities. The lack of written records makes it difficult to follow up and prove facts. With poor records, it is difficult to develop and follow trends on diseases that frequently occur in these communities. Apart from the common malaria and diarrhoea, it is very difficult to track any other infectious and non-infectious diseases that may occur in the communities if the patients do not visit the hospital or health centre. These include sexually transmitted diseases, parasitic skin diseases, measles, cholera and other emerging diseases that may occur exclusively in a particular area. With the health authorities unaware of these occurrences, it is very difficult to control the spread of these infectious diseases. Even if the health authorities try to get information from the community leaders, usually the verbal autopsy (explanation on the cause of death) is so simplified like, \"Mr. A died of a headache and Mr. B died of stomach pain\". The causes of death being outlined are more or less symptoms of other underlying diseases that could have been the possible causes of death.",

Depending on how communities function, their cultures and traditions, countries should be able to implement registration systems that are not only practical with the population in question but also sustainable.

In engaging the community, policy makers will be able to understand the problems and needs faced by the communities instead of imposing what the policy makers assume the community needs. Dialogue and two way communications between stakeholders at national level will assist in achieving better health for rural communities which are often sidelined in developing countries (Fig. 7.4) .

Since most developing countries lack the finances and infrastructure to carry out surveillance on their own, collaborations can help in investing in methods that will benefit the involved parties. Countries should be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses in their healthcare systems and try to support one another to fight infectious diseases. For example, Senegal, Nigeria, Gambia and Mali are close neighbours to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea; the latter being countries that were heavily affected by the 2014 Ebola outbreak in the West Africa region. Senegal, Mali, Nigeria and the Gambia have the laboratory facilities that allowed for rapid testing of Ebola samples as well as surveillance systems that allowed for efficient contact tracing of cases. Their neighbours were completely overwhelmed by the outbreak and lacked the facilities and efficient contact tracing. If there was better collaboration and or partnerships between these countries regarding case testing as well as surveillance, maybe the picture could have been different. Second, if there was collaboration in surveillance as well as contact tracing between the countries, the infected personnel who had contact with the initial cases in Guinea, could not have been allowed to cross borders, there would have been no possibility of repatriating infected bodies from one country to another as was the case when two bodies of individuals who had died from Ebola in Guinea were repatriated to Sierra Leone (WHO|One year into the Ebola epidemic: a deadly, tenacious and unforgiving virus, n.d.). This repatriation put at risk everyone who handled the bodies during the repatriation process including the vehicles used for transport. This was a risk that could have been avoided if there was collaboration between countries in disease prevention and control. Despite the availability of International Health Regulations by WHO, which focus on public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), the response from WHO and international community were quite contrary. Finally, developing countries where infectious diseases are rampant lack resources to establish good surveillance systems; developed countries who are working to prevent diseases have better and well advanced surveillance systems. It is in this regard that developing countries have to work together to combat these challenges which can be better understood by the affected countries. Response from the international community during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was slow and this allowed for further spread of the virus, as the affected countries were overwhelmed by the shock. This calls for efforts from developing countries to set out strategies to combat similar outbreaks in the future. These strategies include: developing capacity in disease surveillance, community awareness and involvement, and improve the healthcare systems as well as develop infrastructure to improve the health and livelihoods of their populations.",

Developing countries ought to work together to set up strategies that will allow for reduction of infectious diseases including disease prevention and control.

Ample consultation of these communities is required in order to identify effective ways of combating infectious diseases.",

The 1973 and 1981 IHR had three quarantine diseases namely, cholera, yellow fever and plague. On 1 January 1982, IHR containing interpretations and recommendations made by the previous WHO assemblies including committee on International Surveillance of Communicable diseases (formerly the committee on International Quarantine) were published. In 1995 there was a call for revision of the IHR and in 2005, the current IHR (2005) were finalized and these are legally binding in 194 countries (States Parties), including all WHO Member States. The current IHR were implemented on 15 June 2007 and these direct and govern the State parties to contribute to global public health security (WHO|Ten things you need to do to implement the IHR, n.d.; WHO|International Health Regulations (2005): Areas of work for implementation, n.d.).",
