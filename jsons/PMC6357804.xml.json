The model is compartmental, using deterministic (differential equation) dynamics for the main population and stochastic dynamics in the communities. We simulate an epidemic in the main population with a seasonal transmission rate that generates an epidemic curve with a shape similar to the epidemic curve of the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil (17). The disease is introduced into communities via infectious contact with the main population, and transmission occurs when infected persons transmit the virus to their susceptible contacts in the community. All susceptible persons have a daily probability of infection from each of their infectious contacts of 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2, where \u03b2 is the force of infection, as well as a daily external hazard of infection from the main population, which varies with the prevalence in the main population.",

Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day), even for asymptomatic infections, and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing was performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and persons infected asymptomatically are assumed to survive without infection to the end of follow-up.

Approach 4 corrects this relative risk estimate under the assumption that the VE can be recovered from the ratio of cumulative hazards. Approaches 5 and 6 use interval-censored models. Here, the exact day of infection for the symptomatic individuals is known (and in practice would be laboratory-confirmed). For the asymptomatically infected individuals, the interval for day of infection ranges from the day of the person\u2019s last negative serological test to the day of their first positive serological test. Two different interval lengths are assessed to determine whether increased frequency of testing yields more precise results (20). As we mentioned above, this approach assumes the ability of the serological test to distinguish between vaccine-acquired immunity and naturally acquired immunity, which is currently possible for some but not all vaccines/pathogens (21\u201323). Finally, in approach 7, a sample of trial participants are tested, and the infection statuses of the asymptomatic individuals not in the sample are imputed. The interval-censored model from approach 6 is then used in the imputed data set.",

This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases. Approach 3 returns an estimate that is biased toward the null in comparison with the true value of VES, also as expected and also worsened at higher levels of R0 (8).

Only testing 10% of the trial participants once at the end of the trial substantially reduces required resources.

Results are essentially unchanged across simulations with a longer duration of the trial, with Ebola-like parameters (Web Table 1), with changes in VE, and with differing proportions of symptomatic persons among the vaccine and control groups (i.e., VEP \u2260 0), as shown in Web Figures 1\u20133 and Web Tables 4 and 5. When the vaccine has an effect on both susceptibility to infection and progression to symptoms, serological testing helps differentiate between VES and VEP except when the total number of cases is low. Similar results are also obtained from simulations with higher R0 values (e.g., 2.5 and 5) (Web Table 5 and Web Figure 2). However, approach 7 is less precise (although it has >95% coverage) for R0 = 5, because the number of people eligible for the trial (i.e., those who remain uninfected before the trial begins) is much lower due to the high rate of infection, decreasing the size of the sample used for imputation.",

However, costs and resources can pose major barriers to estimation of these important values. Here we have discussed different approaches and their varying levels of accuracy and resource requirements for estimating VES and VEP. The corrected relative risk estimate (approach 4), the interval-censored Cox models (approaches 5 and 6), and the imputed interval-censored Cox model (approach 7) provide estimates close to the VES input into the model across values of R0, which is of course also obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of the time of all asymptomatic infections (approach 1). A Cox model considering only symptomatic infections proves biased, especially at higher values of R0. Approaches 1 and 4\u20137 return accurate estimates of VEP, with the exception of approach 7 when R0 is low due to the small number of cases overall and in the sample. In this case, or if higher coverage is desired, a larger sampling percentage can be used (Table 2). While these simulations are parameterized for a Zika-like pathogen given the high proportion of asymptomatic Zika infections, results from simulations with Ebola-like parameters show that these methods are applicable to pathogens other than Zika virus (Web Figure 2).",

While approaches 4\u20137 require substantially fewer resources for estimating VES and VEP than approach 1 and are more accurate than approaches 2 and 3, all participants must be tested at the beginning of the trial to ensure that they are not exposed or immune. Including persons with preexisting immunity in the trial would reduce the total number of overall cases and thus the power, limiting the ability to draw a statistically significant conclusion about the vaccine\u2019s effects. This challenge, however, is not limited to diseases with high proportions of mild or asymptomatic infection, since prior immunity would reduce the power of any trial. Additionally, distinguishing between natural and vaccine-derived immunity can be challenging, especially at the beginning of an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease about which not much is known and for which serological tests are likely in early stages of development (23, 27). Therefore, investments in diagnostic development will also be critical for ensuring accurate VE estimates.",

While parameterized for a Zika-like disease, the approaches and exact parameters described above are not meant to represent a particular epidemic context but merely to serve as a guide when thinking through how to accurately estimate important endpoints of vaccine trials in different settings with limited resources and information. R code for this simple model can be readily modified to reflect disease-, vaccine-, and setting-specific parameters. Identifying resource-preserving methods is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic or mild infection, especially when those cases are still infectious.

Panel B shows who we perceive to be infected and still at risk when considering only symptomatic individuals. When considering only symptomatic events, presumed person-time at risk increases for both the vaccine group and the control group, because all persons with asymptomatic infections are now perceived to be uninfected and at risk for the entire period of the trial. In the vaccine group, 11 people are perceived to still be at risk (panel B), when in reality only 7 remain at risk (panel A), since 4 people are asymptomatically infected. In the control group, 10 people are perceived to be at risk (panel B), when in reality only 2 remain at risk (panel A). Because there are more people infected and therefore more people incorrectly still perceived to be at risk in the control group than in the vaccine group, apparent incidence is underestimated in the controls more so than in the vaccine group, leading to bias towards the null. This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases and more people in the control group become infected but are still perceived to be at risk. At time t postrandomization, person-time at risk in the controls will be overestimated by a factor of e\u039b(t)(1\u2212\u0398Pp)(1\u2212\u0398S) relative to the vaccine group, where \u039b(t) is the cumulative hazard up to time t, p is the symptomatic proportion in controls, and 1\u2212\u03b8S and 1\u2212\u03b8P are the efficacy of the vaccine against infection and the efficacy of the vaccine against disease given infection, respectively (29).
