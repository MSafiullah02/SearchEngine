The climate in recent decades is characterized with increased frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures (Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004). Health effects of global warming are now considered a critical issue (Anderson and Bell, 2011, Kovats and Hajat, 2008, Kovats and Kristie, 2006, O'Neill and Ebi, 2009). Most studies used ambient temperatures (i.e., average, maximum, and minimum temperature) to evaluate heat-related health effects (Hajat et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2006, Knowlton et al., 2007, Kovats et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2012). However, other weather indicators, such as relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), water vapor pressure (WVP) and thermal radiation, also affect the perception of temperature to humans. Several composite indices, including heat index (HI) (Hartz et al., 2012, Metzger et al., 2009), apparent temperature (AT) (Anderson and Bell, 2009, Chung et al., 2009), humidex (Smoyer-Tomic and Rainham, 2001) and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (Epstein and Moran, 2006, Kjellstrom et al., 2009), have been used to evaluate health events associated with heat waves or extremely high temperatures.",

But, no study has determined which index is optimal to predict mortality (Hajat et al., 2010, Vaneckova et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2011). Anderson et al. have indicated that, after adjusting for humidity, the temperature\u2013mortality associations are not significantly different among using average, maximum and apparent temperature metrics (Anderson and Bell, 2009). Barnett et al. (2010) suggested that no temperature index can be considered optimal because all indices are highly correlated with temperature measurements. The applied temperature measurement should be chosen according to practical concerns, i.e. the measure may provide comprehensive information (Barnett et al., 2010). Thus, studies addressing the determination of an optimal high-temperature index to predict health outcomes were still far from being conclusive.",

Therefore, the present study was to report high-temperature indices optimal to evaluate the all-cause mortality and outpatient visits associated with temperatures in Taiwan, a subtropical island, located on the west of the Pacific Ocean. We evaluated models among eight standardized high-temperature indices: average, maximum, and minimum temperature, HI, temperature humidity index (THI), humidex, AT, and WBGT.

The TEPA established Air Quality Monitoring Network in 1993 with 74 stationary monitoring stations throughout the island (Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration, 2011, Taiwan Governmental Information Office, 2008). Concentrations of ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter smaller than 10 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxides (NO2) and ozone (O3), were measured and recorded hourly at each station. We analyzed daily levels of PM10, O3, and NO2, monitored by 14, 10 and 13 general ambient environment stations in Taipei, Central Taiwan, and Southern Taiwan, respectively. Locations of the weather and ambient environment stations are shown in Fig. 1\n.",

The HI based on dry bulb temperature and RH was used in environments with temperatures above 80 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C) and with RH above 40% (Steadman, 1979). The humidex developed by Environment Canada was used as the measure of subjectively perceived temperature and humidity (Masterton and Richardson, 1979). To assess the temperature perception in study population (Rosenberg et al., 1983), we used the Taiwan CWB adopted THI index. It is similar to the thermal discomfort index developed by the U.S. Weather Bureau, widely used in Europe as well to assess heat discomfort (Pantavou et al., 2011). The AT was used as an alternative measure of perceived temperature, which combines several environmental and physiological variables, including temperature, clothing cover, physical activity, WS and WVP (Steadman, 1984). The WBGT developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists was used to estimate heat stress in the working environment.",

A Chinese study showed that, based on model fitting, the mean temperature was a better predictor of mortality than maximum and minimum temperatures (Guo et al., 2011). Yu et al. revealed that mean temperature was an accurate index of all-cause death in Brisbane, Australia (Yu et al., 2011).",

They found that the association with apparent temperature is nearly identical to that with the mean daily temperature after controlling for humidity (Anderson and Bell, 2009). Vaneckova et al. also found that average temperature and composite high-temperature indices perform similarly in estimating mortality risk (Vaneckova et al., 2011). Likewise, all high-temperature indices are significantly associated with mortality in this study because temperature indices are highly correlated with each other. The cumulative mortality risks associated with the composite indices are also relatively similar. In subtropical regions, the consistent high temperature and humidity, and other weather characteristics such as WS and WVP result in a relatively smaller effect on perceived temperature. Barnett et al. (2010) have concluded that no high-temperature index can be considered superior to others, because an optimal high-temperature index is also associated with age groups, seasons, and areas analyzed. They suggest selecting high-temperature index based on practical concerns such as the accessibility of climate measurements, public familiarity with the index, and data available (Barnett et al., 2010).",

The mean apparent temperature is also an indicator that may well predict hospital admissions for several diseases in nine California counties (Green et al., 2010). However, Khalaj et al. found that emergency hospital admissions were more likely correlated with maximum temperature (Khalaj et al., 2010). Our study found similar results that maximum temperature is an optimal high-temperature index for predicting heat-related outpatient visits. The weather associated morbidity may be different between clinical visits and emergency room visits. The choice of high-temperature indices may thus produce subtle differences in assessing possible health-related effects of heat. This study also showed that the optimal high-temperature index for predicting mortality is different from predicting outpatient visits.",

Although, some evidences have shown non-linearity association as the temperature is above the thresholds, with quadratic or larger relationships at the highest temperatures.

In summary, our study observes higher cumulative RRs for mortality than for outpatient visits in association with high temperature. The area-specific RRs of mortality associated with observed and standardized high-temperature indices are clearly non-linear with index values (Fig. S1, Fig. S2, Fig. S3). The corresponding RRs of outpatient visits are more fluctuated and inconsistent (Fig. S4, Fig. S5, Fig. S6). These findings support the study in England that high temperatures have a larger effect on mortality than on morbidity (Kovats et al., 2004). We found the mortality risk increased dramatically as standardized high-temperature indices increased from Z = 1 to 2. Nonetheless, the standardized high-temperature indices have higher RRs at Z = 1 than at Z = 2 for all-cause outpatient visits. A possible explanation is that people who have mild illness may take immediate action in response to remit the symptoms. They may stay in air conditioned environment or drink more fluids against the outdoor high temperature.",

Studies with similar methodologies are thus suggested for populations located in different climates. In addition, this study also found that the risks associated with heat are significant in Taipei and Southern Taiwan rather than in Central Taiwan. Compared with the other two areas, Central Taiwan has lower income and higher portion of the elders (Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan), 2012). However, due to limited detail information for social economics, this study may not conclude any effects related with these factors. Interactions among these variables are recommended to assess in future study. Moreover, this ecological study focused only on all-cause mortality and outpatient visits. Further studies of temperature effects on human physical responses, clinical symptoms of heat exposure, and identification of the most vulnerable groups are needed to establish a comprehensive heat wave warning system in the future.",
