Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were socially distancing. While many of us have experienced overwhelming disruption and stress in our daily lives in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, patients with HS face a daily unpredictable struggle with pain, drainage, odor and psychosocial suffering. Virtual support groups can provide much needed social connection, and physicians and trainees can initiate them. On the evening of March 31st 2020, a group of three patients and struggling with severe hidradenitis suppurativa, accompanied by facilitators, congregated over live video conference to lament a disease that has impacted their lives to an even greater extent than that of a global pandemic.",

As the coronavirus pandemic started tightening its grip on Chicago, we thought proactively how our study could adapt to a society where large group gatherings were now punishable by fine. We invited participants by their provided email addresses in our medical record system as afforded by our IRB-approved protocol two weeks in advance of the scheduled meeting. We attached consent forms and a study information handout. Participants joined the group using a Zoom Video Communications account through Northwestern University. The discussion was semi-structured beginning with introductions, but the content of the discussion was principally patient-directed. Each participant was able to see, speak, and react to other participants in real time. No one experienced technical difficulties that prohibited joining the meeting. While the majority of patients elected to show their faces via webcam, those who deferred were still active discussants.",

Over the course of the hour-long conference, the participants freely discussed diverse topics - Many were concerned about their susceptibility for COVID-19 with current biologic use, and all agreed upon the silver lining in working from home; it makes coping with the pain and frequent care required of HS more manageable.",

Patients with HS have seemingly been ahead of the virtual social movement, as studies demonstrate these patients obtain information about symptoms, home remedies, and prescription treatments online, even prior to a formal diagnosis by a dermatologist (Cole et al., 2019, Hessam et al., 2017). While patients with dermatological conditions certainly subscribe to support groups online, the use of live video support groups in this population is not well defined and may revolutionize how support groups are held in the future.",

A non-disclosure agreement signed by all participants prior to the meeting can protect confidentiality when groups are not held as part of an IRB-approved study with a formal consent form. In a time of widespread subscription to physical distancing, our patients with morbid dermatological disease may benefit immensely from live video conferencing support groups, and I encourage any dermatologist or trainee to facilitate one.",
