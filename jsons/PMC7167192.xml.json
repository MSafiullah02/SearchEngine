The virus is currently spreading fast in mainland China. By 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases have been confirmed nationwide with another 2684 cases suspected.\n5\n\n",

Two very recent studies have suggested bats\n10\n or snakes\n11\n to be the potential natural reservoir of 2019\u2010nCoV. However, based on the latest statement by WHO on 23 January 2020, the source of 2019\u2010nCoV is still unknown.\n12\n The 2019\u2010nCoV appears to cause symptoms similar to SARS based on clinical data from the initial 41 cases\n13\n and seems to be capable of spreading from humans to humans and between cities,\n14\n according to two latest studies\n13\n, \n14\n published in Lancet on 24 January 2020.",

By far, the median number of days of first symptom to death was 14, which was comparable to that of 14 days (median) of MERS.\n28\n For SARS, it was reported that the average duration of first symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, and admission to death was 17.4 days for casualties.\n29\n Our study also found that people 70 years or older had shorter median days (11.5 days) from the first symptom to death than those with ages below 70 years (20 days), demonstrating that elderly people might have faster disease progression than younger people. Similar results were found in SARS in that the mean duration from admission to death was 5.7 days for people aged 80 to 93 years, 9.4 days for those aged 60 to 79 years, and above 12.0 days for those under 60 years of age.\n29\n It was also reported that older age (>60 years) was a risk factor that correlated with mortality in MERS.\n28\n From the above, although a definite comparison could not be drawn, the public should pay attention to elderly people who might be more vulnerable to the 2019\u2010nCoV.",
