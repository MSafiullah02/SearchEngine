Mature parasite stages sequester in the intervillous (maternal) vascular spaces of the placenta by binding to the receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) [8]. CSA-binding parasites are common in pregnant women but uncommon in nonpregnant individuals. Women lack immunity to the CSA-binding parasite before their first pregnancy, which might explain why primigravidae are highly susceptible [9]. Women who are exposed to malaria become resistant over successive pregnancies as they acquire antibodies against the placental CSA-binding parasites [9]. In areas of stable malaria transmission, multigravidae typically control parasitemia before symptoms or sequelae develop. Younger age and HIV infection also increase susceptibility to pregnancy malaria [10].",

These women are at high risk of severe syndromes and death if they become infected, regardless of gravidity, and abortion or fetal death can occur during acute febrile or severe malaria episodes [11,12]. Among semi-immune women in areas of stable transmission, severe maternal anemia and low birth weight are common sequelae of infection during pregnancy [13], and these contribute to significant maternal and infant mortality. Placental malaria may also modify parasitemia risk in the offspring in a gravidity-dependent manner: in Tanzania, placental malaria was recently reported to decrease parasitemia risk in offspring of first-time mothers but to increase risk in offspring of multigravidae, and these effects persisted throughout infancy [14]. To prevent these poor outcomes, the WHO recommends that pregnant women throughout Africa receive intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) and use insecticide-treated bed nets to reduce the risk of placental malaria, which might also reduce the risk of congenital malaria.",

P. falciparum can persist for months to years [30] and P. malariae can persist for decades as blood-stage infections (the stage that multiplies in red blood cells).

Garnham, who authored the standard illustrated guide to malaria parasites, did not observe parasitemia during the first week of life in any of 146 neonates born to Kenyan women infected with P. falciparum at delivery [47]. Bruce-Chwatt observed no peripheral parasitemias in 567 Nigerian newborns on the first day of life, and only one parasitemia during the first week of life; by contrast, 27.4% of their mothers were parasitemic at delivery [43]. Similarly, McGregor observed no parasitemias within the first day of life in 147 Gambian newborns of mothers with infected placentas [60]. Covell, who reviewed the world literature in 1950, estimated that congenital malaria occurs in 0.3% of children born to infected women with high levels of immunity [62].",

Since PCR is highly sensitive, contamination of cord blood by minute amounts of placental blood could cause false-positive PCR results. Furthermore, PCR-based assays are simply an amplification of nucleic acids, and it is possible that free nucleic acids are circulating independently of viable parasites [63]. For these reasons, prevalence studies using PCR assessment of cord blood may overestimate the true rate of congenital malaria in endemic settings. Notably, PCR only detected parasites in one of 298 peripheral blood samples collected from Tanzanian neonates within the first week of life [40], a much lower prevalence compared with the PCR studies of cord blood.",

These findings further imply that many cases of mother-to-child transmission are occurring in utero and not at the time of delivery, since transmission at the time of delivery would be expected to yield genetically identical parasites in placental and cord blood samples. Nevertheless, the relevance of cord blood parasites detected by PCR to symptomatic congenital malaria or neonatal outcomes is unclear.

This cohort included women who attended antenatal clinics that offered weekly malaria screening and treatment for all positive cases, which likely decreased the incidence of congenital infection. In colonial Nigeria, three clinical congenital malaria cases occurred among a sequential series of 37 offspring born to expatriate women, many of whom reported taking antimalarial prophylaxis during pregnancy [12]. In the early 1900\u2019s, when malaria was endemic in the USA, Thibault reported four cases of congenital malaria (including one infected stillbirth) among 249 newborns delivered by infected women [61].

            "text": "The geographic origins of cases in the USA generally parallel immigration patterns. An increase in congenital malaria cases starting in 1979 reflected the influx of immigrants and refugees from South-East Asia [64,85], and subsequent increases from Latin America [64]. Currently (1991\u20132004), the largest number of US cases originate from Central America, followed by South Asia. Interestingly, the geographic origins of malaria cases in pregnant women are also significantly different from those of congenital cases (Chi square, p = 0.0002). Pregnant women were more likely to have acquired their infection in Africa, whereas congenital malaria cases originated from non-African sources (Figure 3). This may be due to differences in immune status of the mothers, genetic factors, transmissibility of different parasite species or reporting bias.",

In a series of 37 expatriates delivering in colonial Nigeria, three offspring presented with congenital malaria shortly after birth, with symptoms that included fever, vomiting, pallor, convulsions, pulmonary edema, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice [12].

Anemia is often misattributed to Rh or ABO incompatibility [87], and the triad of fever, anemia and splenomegaly to one of the TORCH syndromes (toxoplasmosis, other [syphilis], rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex) or to neonatal sepsis [64,88].

After the first week of life, congenital malaria is difficult to distinguish from mosquito-transmitted malaria in these settings, and therefore the true incidence of congenital malaria remains a focus for future research.
