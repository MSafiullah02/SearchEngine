GST-removed HR2-38 and HR2-44 were both soluble proteins in PBS.

Despite our extensive experiments, using both the synthetic and bio-engineered HR1s, we did not see any virus-infection inhibition effect from HR1 (data not shown). This might reflect the difference between HR1 and HR2 in the virus entry inhibition as observed in some paramyxoviruses [31], [32], [34], [35], [36]. The mechanism underlying this difference needs to be further investigated in the future. It is noteworthy that, in a recent study on MHV, only HR2 inhibition has been observed [12].",

Receptor-induced conformational changes in the S protein are crucial in this step [20], [21], [22]. In this study, we have shown that the putative HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV bind to each other and form a 6-\u03b1-helix bundle (trimer of HR1/HR2 dimer), a characteristics of class I viral fusion proteins. The importance of the HR regions in MHV fusion has been demonstrated with site-directed mutagenesis study by Luo and Weiss [10], [11]. As the receptor for SARS-CoV has been identified recently [37], receptor-induced conformational changes of S protein should be pursued in the near future, esp. the conformations of HR1 and HR2 fusion core in different stages during the fusion process.",

            "text": "Recently, Rottier and co-workers [12] reported the formation of HR1/HR2 6-helix bundle complex of MHV S protein. This and our present result on SARS virus are the first evidence for a 6-helix bundle formation of HR1 and HR2 and the HR2 fusion inhibitor derived from Family Coronaviridae, implying that coronavirus adopts a similar fusion or entry mechanism to other RNA viruses [13]. Taking the fact into account that SARS is an acute disease, this kind of peptide inhibitors might act better than that in chronic infection HIV because the therapeutic peptide can be used through intranasal route. The conformational changes of the S protein are very likely to be crucial for coronavirus entry [20], [21], [22] and so this provides a most plausible target for drug design. The strong inhibition of the peptide in the GST (25 kDa) fusion form indicates that there is significant space for HR2 to interact with HR1 in the intermediate state of the S protein during the process of virus fusion. This has also been observed in our previous work on Newcastle disease virus and hRSV, members of Family Paramyxoviridae\n[31], [32]. Our results do provide a drug lead for SARS-CoV and its potential clinical application should be rigorously pursued in the near future. A clear crystal structure of this fusion core of SARS-CoV would also make a great deal of contribution to our understanding of coronavirus fusion and fusion inhibitor discovery.",
