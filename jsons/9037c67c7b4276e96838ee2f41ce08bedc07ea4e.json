            "text": "A mannose-binding lectin (Narcissus tazetta lectin [NTL]) with potent antiviral activity was isolated and purifi ed from the bulbs of the Chinese daffodil Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis, using ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose, affinity chromatography on mannose-agarose and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC)-gel filtration on Superose 12. The purified lectin was shown to have an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa by gel filtration and 13 kDa by SDS-PAGE, indicating that it is probably a dimer with two identical subunits. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of NTL as determined by molecular cloning also reveals that NTL protein contains a mature polypeptide consisting of 105 amino acids and a C-terminal peptide extension. Three-dimensional modelling study demonstrated that the NTL primary polypeptide contains three subdomains, each with a conserved mannose-binding site. It shows a high homology of about 60%-80% similarity with the existing monocot mannose-binding lectins. NTL could signifi cantly inhibit plaque formation by the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with an IC 50 of 2.30 \u03bcg/ml and exhibit strong antiviral properties against infl uenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) and infl uenza B viruses with IC 50 values ranging from 0.20 \u03bcg/ml to 1.33 \u03bcg/ml in a dose-dependent manner. It is worth noting that the modes of antiviral action of NTL against RSV and infl uenza A virus are signifi cantly different. NTL is effective in the inhibition of RSV during the whole viral infection cycle, but the antiviral activity of NTL is mainly expressed at the early stage of the viral cycle of infl uenza A (H1N1) virus. NTL with a high selective index (SI=CC 50 /IC 50 >141) resulting from its potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity demonstrates a potential for biotechnological development as an antiviral agent.",

            "text": "Many plant lectins are known to possess antiviral properties against human enveloped viruses (Balzarini 2007a) . They play important biological roles both within and outside the plants. A majority of plant lectins are involved in defence. In many plants, lectins are usually associated with storage tissues such as seeds, tubers, bulbs, corms, rhizomes, root stocks and bark (Van Damme et al. 1995) . The antiviral activities of various lectins have been demonstrated against the human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) (Balzarini et al. 1992; Balzarini 2006) , human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Balzarini et al. 1991 (Balzarini et al. , 1992 , hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Bertaux et al. 2007 ), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-I) (Ooi et al. 2004a ), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (Luo et al. 2007) , infl uenza A (H1N1) virus (Ooi et al. 2004b) , poxvirus (Kaur et al. 2007 ), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Ooi et al. 2004b ) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Keyaerts et al. 2007 ). There has been increasing interest in recent years in the special characteristics of lectins derived from monocot plants (Van Damme et al. 1995) . The monocot mannose-binding lectins belong to a superfamily of structurally and evolutionarily related proteins (Barre et al. 1996) . This group of lectins shares a number of biological properties, such as rabbit erythrocyte haemagglutination, antiviral activity (Balzarini et al. 2006 (Balzarini et al. , 2007b Keyaerts et al. 2007 ) and insecticidal effect (Gatehouse et al. 1995; Hogervorst et al. 2006; Ohizumi et al. 2009 ).",

A potent antiviral lectin from N. tazetta (designated NTL) exists as a homodimer consisting of two identical subunits of 13 kDa (Ooi et al. 2000 (Ooi et al. , 2001 . In mouse, intraperitoneal injection of NTL modulates the gene expression of immunoregulatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and stem cell factor (SCF) in macrophages and/or spleen cells (Ooi et al. 2002) . Furthermore, NTL is shown to preserve haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells after 35 days of culture in a serum-and cytokinefree condition, and enhance ex vivo expansion of severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID)-repopulating cells (Li et al. 2008) . The dual functions of NTL in preservation of early stem and progenitor cells, and expansion of lineagecommitted cells in prolonged culture could be developed for clinical expansion of CD34 + cells for transplantation and use of these cells for other cell therapy strategies. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of a novel mannosebinding lectin isolated, purifi ed and cloned from the bulbs of the Chinese daffodil, Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis, against human RSV, and various strains of infl uenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) and infl uenza B viruses.",

Purifi ed NTL (derived from the NTM2 fraction) was obtained after FPLC-gel fi ltration followed by desalting with a PD-10 column, and its purity was analysed by SDS-PAGE (fi gure 1). It was determined to have a molecu lar mass of about 26 kDa by gel filtration and 13 kDa by SDS-PAGE. NTL is suggested to be a mannose-binding homodimer with two identical subunits of about 13 kDa. Molecular cloning revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the fulllength cDNA encoding NTL contained a mature polypeptide consisting of 105 amino acids and a C-terminal peptide extension beyond the C-terminal amino acids Thr-Gly (table 1) . There are two fixed-position cysteines within the protein domain (amino acids 29 and 52), which are probably involved in the disulphide-bond linkage within the molecules to confer the secondary structure of the mature lectin. One third of the deduced amino acid composition consisted of glycine, leucine and asparagines (table 1) . According to an NCBI conserved domain search, NTL protein possesses a \u03b2-lectin conserved domain, and 3 typical mannose-binding sites (Q_D_N_V_Y, from Q26 to Y34, Q57 to Y65 and Q89 to Y97, respectively) resembling many other monocot mannose-binding lectins, such as Galanthus nivalis (Van Damme et al. 1991; Hester et al. 1995; Barre et al. 2001) . Four conserved amino acid residues (Gln, Asp, Asn and Tyr) in the mannose-binding sites were predicted to form hydrogen bonds with O2, O3 and O4 of mannose, and hydrophobic residue Val to interact with C3 and C4 of mannose through hydrophobic interactions. The 3D structure prediction of the NTL protein using SWISS-MODEL indicates that NTL is composed of 28 alpha helixes, 52 extended strands and 83 random coils, and that its monomer contains three subdomains, each with a conserved mannose-binding site (fi gure 2). Two subdomains were orthogonal with four-stranded beta-sheets and the other was orthogonal with three-stranded beta-sheets. The three subdomain bundles were asymmetrically arranged as a \u03b2-prism, and extended strands in each subdomain were perpendicular to the axis of the prism.",

NTL could effectively inhibit RSV-induced plaque formation (IC 50 = 2.30 \u03bcg/ml). Its cytotoxicity against HEp-2 cells was low (CC 50 = 325.4 \u03bcg/ml) and thus it had a high SI value of 141.36. Similarly, the inhibition of replication of various infl uenza subtypes was clearly dose dependent. Viral infectivity with human infl uenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and infl uenza B viruses was strongly inhibited by NTL with EC 50 values ranging from 0.02 \u03bcg/ml to 1.33 \u03bcg/ml. However, NTL had weaker antiviral activity against the avian infl uenza (H5N1) virus than human infl uenza viruses, as no IC 50 for H5N1 virus can be determined only up to a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml. In parallel with antiviral activity, the cytotoxicity of NTL on MDCK cells was monitored by a colorimetric MTT assay. In concentrations of up to 500 \u03bcg/ml, no cell toxicity was observed by determining the effect on cell viability in MTT assay and cell morphology. The low cytotoxicity together with the high SI indicate that NTL possesses potential for biotechnological development as an antiviral agent against RSV and human infl uenza viruses, although potential application against avian infl uenza viruses remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Further investigation on its mode of action against RSV revealed that signifi cant reduction in the number of plaques was observed when NTL was present during the whole viral infection cycle (inhibition by 76.43%). The inhibition rate was 36.57% if NTL was present only during the early infection phase (i.e. the fi rst 2 h post-infection) and 45.73% if it was added in the later infection phase (i.e. sample only present 2 h post-infection). However, a similar investigation on the antiviral activity of NTL against the H1N1 virus (A/HongKong/CUHK-13003/2002) indicated that the target of NTL was mainly in the early phase (i.e. virus adsorption phase). As the early infection events of infl uenza viruses were inhibited, NTL might be virucidal or, like some other antiviral lectins, it might interact with the glycans on glycoproteins present on the envelope of the virus, which are crucial for attachment or fusion, and prevent them from functioning normally in the replication cycle. The results of mechanistic studies on the antiviral action of NTL against the two different viruses (RSV and Flu A) probably suggest that during different phases of the viral infection cycle, the addition of NTL at the time of adsorption and/or penetration is very important. It is also worth noting that the modes of antiviral action of NTL against RSV and infl uenza A (H1N1) virus are signifi cantly different. The inhibitory effect was mainly expressed in the early stage of the viral cycle in the H1N1 virus. Nevertheless, NTL actively inhibited RSV during the whole infection cycle of the virus.",

            "text": "It has been showed that Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) from U. dioica strongly binds to the glycans on the HIV-1 attachment protein gp120, and prevents HIV entry and transmission when co-cultivated with persistently HIVinfected and -uninfected cells in the lower \u03bcg/ml range (Balzarini 2006) . Some other lectins are also able to inhibit viral entry. Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA) and UDA have been found to be able to inhibit the entry of HCV and HIV-1 into their target cells (Bertaux et al. 2007) . Similarly, HHA inhibits SARS-CoV replication when added at the moment of infection (Keyaerts et al. 2007) . This is in line with the mode of action of the infl uenza A virus in the present study. Nonetheless, HHA is also able to inhibit the extracellular viral load when added up to 5 h post-infection (a time near the end of the virus replication cycle). Thus, HHA interacts both at virus entry and at virus release (Keyaerts et al. 2007 ). The result of our time of addition experiment of NTL against RSV is in agreement with that of the interaction of HHA with SARS-CoV. NTL is active in inhibiting RSV during the entire infection cycle. To inhibit RSV infection, the possible targets that NTL can bind to are the glycoproteins present on the RSV envelope. Three envelope glycoproteins are present on RSV, including the G protein, F protein and SH protein (Feldman et al. 2001) . Both the G and F proteins may be involved in the initial attachment of RSV to the host cell, and the F protein is largely responsible for the subsequent fusion process, though the highest level of fusion was observed when all three glycoproteins were present (Feldman et al. 2001) . This interaction may be blocked if the RSV glycoproteins are bound by NTL, and thus the spread of RSV would be affected. In the present study, NTL was also found to be able to reduce plaque formation when added during the later infection phase. Whether NTL interferes with RSV spread by binding to viral glycoproteins or inhibits other events during the process of viral replication or assembly remains to be elucidated. Ooi ",

(2001). The MDCK cells were incubated with serially 2-fold dilutions of NTL for 30 min in a 24-well plate (Nunc, Denmark), and then challenged with the infl uenza viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 0.001 PFU/cell for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. The virus-containing supernatants (extracellular virus), after one freeze-thaw cycle, were further titrated by plaque assay adopted fromTobita et al. (1975). Non-infected cell controls and virus controls were performed in each experiment. Data were reported as the effective concentration of the compound required to inhibit viral infectivity by 50% (IC 50 ) (fi gure 4).2.5.2 Mode of anti-infl uenza action -haemagglutination (HA) assay:To study the mode of action of NTL against infl uenza viruses, the virus titres from cultures treated with the drug 1 h prior to or post-virus inoculation were compared. Confl uent MDCK cells in 24-well plates were incubated with or without NTL (15 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and challenged with 10-fold serial dilutions of viruses in the presence or absence of NTL. After 1 h of viral adsorption at 37\u00b0C, cells were rinsed with PBS and further incubated with NTL for 72 h.",
