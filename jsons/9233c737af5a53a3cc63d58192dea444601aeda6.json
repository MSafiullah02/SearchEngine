            "text": "Recommender systems have recently become prominent tools to provide personalized services for customers, so as to alleviate the information overload problem [3] . A number of recommenders [2, 3, 10, 11] have been proposed to help infer users' potential interests based on their heterogeneous implicit feedback (HIF). Taking e-commerce as an example, the recommenders mainly leverage users' historical behaviors of various types (e.g., view, click, add-to-cart, purchase) to help predict what product to purchase afterwards. In this scenario, purchase is the target behavior, which directly reflects users' preference towards products. In contrast, view, click, add-to-cart are auxiliary behaviors to indirectly suggest users' taste over products to some extent. Both target and auxiliary behaviors benefit for user preference inference, possibly with different degrees. Running Example. To illustrate, Fig. 1 (a) depicts real user behaviors on products in an e-commerce system (e.g. Amazon), where two essential characteristics are noted: (1) Temporal dynamics: users perform sequential behaviors over products with different orders, indicating different behavior patterns. For instance, Bob and Alice prefer add-to-cart before purchase, whilst Ella directly buys the 'Coat' after click without add-to-cart. (2) Repeated behaviors: users may perform certain behaviors several times over products, reflecting a reinforced preference to some degree. For example, Alice clicks twice to check details before she makes the purchase decision; Ella may be quite satisfied with the quality after purchasing the 'Coat' and directly buy another one for her friend.",

They, however, are not well investigated by existing HIF based studies: (1) most methods [1, 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] directly ignore the temporal dynamics. They only model the influence of limited types of user behaviors (e.g., only view and purchase) via a weighted combination, which heavily restricts the generability of these methods; (2) although several approaches [2, 10] notice the temporal dynamics, they simply pre-define a hard rule to order various user behaviors, thus failing to capture the real temporal dynamics. For instance, they assume that add-to-cart must come before purchase and after click. In Fig. 1(b) , all users share the same behavior pattern based on the hard rule: click \u2192 add-to-cart \u2192 purchase regardless of what their real behaviors are; and (3) none of them considers the repeated user behaviors. They merely merge the duplicated user-item interactions by keeping the earliest one. In Fig. 1 , click twice is only treated as click once for Alice. In this sense, there's much room left to better exploit the temporal dynamics and repeated behaviors in HIF based recommendation.",

It uses gated recurrent units to accurately model the temporal dynamics and repeated patterns of auxiliary behaviors that happen before its corresponding target behavior; and (3) Fusion Module devises three strategies (i.e., MLP [6] , Attention mechanism [9] and Outer product) to seamlessly integrate both target and auxiliary behaviors for a more accurate user preference estimation.",

            "text": "Early works solely leverage target behavior for the recommendation. For example, Rendle et al. proposed BPRMF [15] to maximize the difference of user preference over items with and without target behavior. After that, many variants have been proposed based upon BPRMF, such as GBPR [11] , ABPR [12] and eALS [5] . However, they all fail to fully exploit the HIF by taking into account target behaviors only. Later, some researchers attempted to employ auxiliary behaviors (e.g., view, click ) in addition to target behavior for the performance-enhanced recommendation. For instance, Qiu et al. designed TBPR/BPRH [13, 14] to utilize purchase, view and like for trinity preference ranking. Ding et al. proposed VALS [1] by fusing purchase with view through manually pre-defined weights. GcBPR [3] resolved the data sparsity problem by generating target behavior from a linear regression of auxiliary behaviors. Yin et al. devised SPTF [18] to overcome the issue of heavy skewness of the interaction distribution w.r.t. different types of HIF. Nevertheless, these methods all ignore the temporal dynamics and repeated patterns of user behaviors for the recommendation. Furthermore, most of them only consider limited types of auxiliary behaviors, thus restricting their generability. Afterwards, Loni et al. proposed McBPR [10] to capture the temporal dynamics by a pre-defined hard rule (e.g., add-to-cart must occur before purchase and after click ), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) . Undoubtedly, the proposed hard rule cannot truly express the temporal dynamics and repeated user behaviors.",

Being capable of capturing the non-linearity of useritem interactions, they have been widely applied to the recommendation with HIF [6, 7] . Similar to conventional recommenders, early deep learning-based recommenders only model user preference with target behavior, such as NCF [6] . Soon afterwards, He et al. further designed ConvNCF [7] to use an outer product and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn high-order correlations among user-item interactions. Later, some studies turn to fuse both target and auxiliary behaviors. Wen et al. [17] devised a neural framework to capture both linearity and non-linearity of heterogeneous behaviors through. Recently, Gao et al. developed a neural model named NTMR [2] encoding a hard rule-based order for heterogeneous user behaviors, that is, add-to-cart must appear before purchase and after view. All of these methods mentioned above, however, fail to model the temporal dynamics and repeated behavior for a high-quality recommendation.",

However, we contend that the temporal dynamics are capable of reflecting user behavior patterns, and the repeated behaviors may indicate a reinforced user preference. Hence, we conduct data segmentation to simulate the real scenario better. Given all behaviors between (u, i) pair ordered by time, for example, B(u, i) = {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , f, a 4 , f, f}, we first split them into m sequences by target behavior, e.g., S 1 (u, i) = {a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , f}, S 2 (u, i) = {a 4 , f} and S 3 (u, i) = {f }, such that each sequence consists of one target behavior and all the auxiliary behaviors before it if available. m is the number of target behaviors in B(u, i). We then feed all the segmented sequences, e.g., S 1 (u, i), S 2 (u, i) and S 3 (u, i), between (u, i) pair for model training, to estimate the preference score of u over i, i.e.,\u0177 ui , and generate a personalized ranking list with top-N items based on the preference scores.

The gated recurrent units (GRU) [8] are applied to help model the temporal dynamics and repeated patterns encoded in the auxiliary behavior sequence S a (u, i), as GRU has proven to be more adaptive and stable with fewer parameters in comparison with recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) [8] .",

Note that the performance improvements on Taobao2014 and Xing are much larger than those on Taobao2017. This may be attributed to their different distributions w.r.t. the lengths of auxiliary behavior sequence. As shown in Fig. 3 , the average length of sequences on Taobao2014 (10) and Xing (3) is longer than that on Taobao2017 (2), Second, by ordering various behaviors via a hard rule, TDRB w/o rb&td is underperformed by TDRB w/o rb especially on Taobao2017, which validates the assumption that the hard rule cannot truly reflect user behaviors, thus failing to capture the real temporal dynamics.

This might be explained as: the hard rule used to order heterogeneous behaviors in McBPR cannot truly reflect the temporal dynamics of user behaviors, thus introducing noises and hurting the performance. Similar trends can be observed on the performance comparison between the two deep learning-based recommenders: ConvNCF and NMTR. Only target behavior is exploited by ConvNCF; whilst NMTR adopts a hard rule to integrate both target and auxiliary behaviors; (4) Overall, our proposed TDRB achieves the best performance across the three datasets. The significant enhancements, with a lift of 27.91% and 61.32% w.r.t. HR and NDCG on average, demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling temporal dynamics and repeated behaviors. Table 2 . The performance of all comparison methods, where the best performance of the baselines is marked with '*'; the performance of TDRB (i.e., TDRBop that performs the best among all variants of TDRB) is highlighted in bold; 'Improve' indicates the improvements that TDRB achieves relative to the '*' results.",

Being equipped with three core modules (i.e., Target, Auxilary and Fusion), TDRB is capable of better modeling user preference, thus achieving superior recommendation performance. Extensive empirical studies on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed TDRB. For future work, we intend to explore more values of the repeated behaviors for the next item recommendation.",
