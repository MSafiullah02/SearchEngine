            "text": "An outbreak of atypical pneumonia, first emerged in Guangdong province of China and termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the World Health Organization, rapidly spread to many regions and countries from late 2002 to early 2003. Thousands of people got infected and hundreds of them were claimed. A novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent of SARS [1], [2], [3]. Since this virus is a novel pathogen for humans and its many aspects remain unknown, accurate diagnostic tools and protective vaccine will play an indispensable role in its control. The genome of the SARS-CoV was predicted to encode replicase 1a and 1b,4 structural proteins, including spike glycoprotein (S protein), envelope glycoprotein (E protein), membrane protein (M protein) and nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and some putative uncharacterized proteins [1], [4], [5]. Although these putative uncharacterized proteins have not been found in other known coronaviruses, it is possible for them to be present and play certain function in the SARS-CoV. For example, a unique novel protein 3a of the SARS-CoV was identified and characterized recently [6], [7].",

            "text": "Humoral immunity is one of the immune responses for defense against viral infection. Hence, investigation of human immune responses to the pathogens will provide us important information about the mechanism of how the pathogens interact with their hosts. To understand the humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV, Li et al. [8] studied the profile of specific IgG and IgM antibodies in SARS patient sera by indirect ELISA. They found that specific IgG antibodies were present in all tested convalescent patient sera and persisted for a long time (until week 12), but specific IgM antibodies remained measurable for a much shorter period, suggesting that IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV may represent the primary humoral immune response protecting patients against SARS. Although several articles have been published on the antibody response against the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and their contribution to protective immunity [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], more extensive study on the profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the SARS-CoV remains to be uncovered, and it could help us not only to understand the humoral immunity but also to develop specific diagnostic tools and vaccine.",

Mezzasoma et al. [17] generated protein microarrays by printing five microbial antigens to simultaneously determine the specific antibodies in human sera. Human IgG and IgM bound to the printed antigens were detected by confocal scanning microscopy and quantified with internal calibration curves. The determination results were well concordant with those by ELISA. This suggested the feasibility of utilizing antigen microarrays to determine specific antibodies in human sera. In our previous study [18], to investigate the antigenicity of N protein of the SARS-CoV by protein microarray containing different recombinant truncated N proteins, human IgG at serial concentrations were printed onto slides to act as internal calibration standards. The fluorescence intensity (FI) values gave good linear correlation with human IgG concentrations, indicating that FI values could be used to assess the relative levels of specific antibodies captured by respective antigens on a microarray.",

Our results indicate that they may not induce antibody production in humans or the antibody concentrations may be too low to be detected. Another possible reasons that could not be ruled out are that the bacteria expressing proteins were not folded or post-translationally modified correctly to recognize the corresponding antibodies. Similar results for proteins E, M and 7a (also known as U122) could be seen in a newly published paper [13]. Tan et al. expressed full length proteins E, M and 7a in mammalian cells and the total protein lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with sera from three convalescent-phase SARS patients, but no antibodies to these proteins were detected.",

            "text": "So far, serological diagnosis for SARS has been the most reliable laboratory method. In contrast to the whole virus-based assays, recombinant protein-based assays have the advantages of safety and economy. Several research groups have evaluated the possibility of using recombinant proteins N, S and/or 3a for serological diagnosis in the past year [13], [18], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Anti-N has been proved to be the most frequent antibody in SARS patients and bacteria expressing N protein or even some truncated N proteins are highly immunogenic [13], [18], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Although anti-S antibody was detected in 100% (74/74) of convalescent-phase sera by immunofluorescence with mammalian cells expressing S protein [13], it was only detected in 47.5% (19/40) of SARS patient sera by Western blotting with bacteria expressing S protein [24]. Anti-3a was detected in 73% (59/81) of convalescent-phase sera by Western blotting with bacteria expressing 3a protein (aa 134\u2013274) [13]. In the present study, we used a protein microarray to qualitatively and quantitatively screen the serological diagnostic markers. Among the detectable antibodies to proteins S3, 3a, N and 9b, anti-N and anti-S3 were the dominant, with 100% and 98.3%, respectively, of positive rates and high-level of FI values (9848 and 3581, respectively) in the convalescent-phase SARS patient sera, and even in the sample missing anti-S3, both anti-S2 and anti-S5 were detected. This indicates that anti-N and anti-S antibodies are sensitive diagnostic markers for the SARS-CoV infection, and bacterial expressed recombinant proteins N and S3 (aa 241\u2013591) could be used for antibody detection. However, anti-3a and anti-9b were only detected in 60.3% and 41.4%, respectively, of the sera, with low-level of FI values (1122 and 721, respectively), suggesting that there is limitation of using these two antibodies as diagnostic markers for the SARS-CoV infection.",

This approach would be facilitated by knowledge of the relative importance of the various viral structural proteins in inducing protective immunity. In the present study, the rabbit antisera to recombinant fusion proteins S3 (aa 241\u2013591), N (full length), 3a (aa 125\u2013274) and 9b (full length) were tested for their neutralizing activity to the infectivity of 100 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, but only anti-S3 serum showed significant neutralizing activity to the SARS-CoV infection, with a neutralizing antibody titer of 708. This suggests that S protein is a neutralization antigen for the SARS-CoV, and recombinant protein S3 (aa 241\u2013591) may be used as a candidate subunit vaccine. Although anti-N antibody is also present in SARS patient sera at a high-level and persisted for a long time (until week 30), recombinant N protein could not induce a detectable neutralizing antibody in rabbit to the SARS-CoV infection. In other papers about the SARS-CoV vaccine studies, only S among the structural proteins could induce protective immunity in experimental animals [9], [10]. For example, Buchholz et al. [9] investigated the contributions of the structural proteins (S, E, M and N) of the SARS-CoV to protective immunity by expressing them individually and in combinations from a recombinant parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 vector called BHPIV3, then evaluating BHPIV3/SARS recombinants for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in hamsters. The results identified protein S among the structural proteins as the only significant neutralization antigen and showed that a single mucosal immunization is highly protective in an experimental animal that supported efficient replication of the SARS-CoV.",

The sequence of individually expressed S1 (aa 1\u2013668) and S2 (aa 669\u20131255) formed the whole sequence of S protein, but these two recombinant proteins only reacted with 75.9% and 29.3% of the patient sera, respectively. Although the sequence of S1 covered that of S3 (aa 241\u2013591), S3 was much more sensitive to detect the patient sera, suggesting that some important epitopes appeared in the conformation of S3 but not in that of S1. In addition, S2 (aa 669\u20131255) and S5 (aa 647\u2013935) could react with the sample missing anti-S3 antibody, suggesting one or more important epitopes may be present in the overlapping sequence of S2 and S5, aa 669\u2013935.
