            "text": "Since the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which was caused by the pathogen SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several other human CoVs have been identified, such as Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63; van der Hoek et al., 2004 \u25b6), Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1; Woo et al., 2005 \u25b6) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; Zaki et al., 2012 \u25b6). HCoV-HKU1 was first isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) of a 71-year-old man with pneumonia in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2005 \u25b6) and was subsequently found to be globally distributed (Zhao et al., 2008 \u25b6). It is associated with both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract disease in both children and adults (Dominguez et al., 2013 \u25b6) and may cause serious consequences in patients with a compromised or immature immune system, such as asthma sufferers (Kistler et al., 2007 \u25b6; Zhao et al., 2008 \u25b6; To et al., 2013 \u25b6). Patients usually present symptoms such as cough, fever, expectoration, bronchitis and pneumonia (Zhao et al., 2008 \u25b6; Cui et al., 2011 \u25b6; To et al., 2013 \u25b6). HCoV-HKU1 belongs to group A of the Betacoronavirus genus within the Coronavirinae subfamily. Similar to other coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 contains a single-stranded positive-sense polyadenylated RNA genome that encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316), which assemble into a large replication\u2013transcription complex for virus replication. Nonstructural protein 9, a single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding protein which exists as a dimer in physiological situations, has been found to be indispensible for virus replication based on reverse-genetics experiments (Deming et al., 2007 \u25b6; Miknis et al., 2009 \u25b6; Chen et al., 2009 \u25b6) and proteomics studies (Pan et al., 2008 \u25b6; von Brunn et al., 2007 \u25b6).",

            "text": "In earlier studies of MHV (Mouse hepatitis virus), the representative species of group A within the Betacoronavirus genus, it was found that there are two essential and overlapping RNA secondary structures which are critical for viral RNA synthesis in the upstream end of the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) within the MHV genome (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008 \u25b6). These sequences interact with the nsp9 protein. Interestingly, a markedly defective growth phenotype, generated by inserting 6 nt (AACAAG) into this 3\u2032-UTR of the MHV genome, can be commendably compensated by an N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein from MHV (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008 \u25b6). Currently, the structural mechanism underlying this rescue experiment remains unknown. It has been proposed that N60K mutation may cause certain conformational changes of nsp9 (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008 \u25b6). We have attempted to crystallize the N60K mutant of nsp9 from MHV to study the underlying structural mechanism, but failed to obtain crystals. Nonetheless, Asn60 is conserved within group A of the Betacoronavirus genus. Thus, the N60K mutant of nsp9 from HCoV-HKU1, another member of group A of the Betacoronavirus genus, was chosen as an alternative. In this study, the N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 was cloned and subjected to crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies.",

The N60K mutation was introduced by the site-directed mutagenesis method (Chen et al., 2013 \u25b6) using the Easy site-directed mutagenesis kit (Transgen, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China; Table 1 \u25b6). The targeted pGEX-6p-1 construct of the N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 was verified by sequencing. It was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml\u22121 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cultures were induced to express the N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 at 289 K for 16 h. Thereafter, centrifugation was used to harvest the cells and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol. After sonication at 277 K, the lysate of the bacteria was centrifuged at 12 000g for 40 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto a disposable column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) for purifying GST-tagged N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein. The fusion protein was then subjected to on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (Pharmacia) at 277 K for 18 h. The protease was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml\u22121 in PBS for proteolysis. Five additional residues (GPLGS) were left at the N-terminus of the N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein. The resulting protein of interest was further purified by the size-exclusion chromatography method using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer consisting of 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl pH 6.0 and reached more than 95% purity by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 \u25b6\na). Typical yields were 5 mg of purified protein per litre of bacterial culture.",

Data were collected using a MAR165 charge-coupled device detector on beamline 1W2B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility with a wavelength of 1.0000 \u00c5. The N60K protein crystals showed high-quality diffraction patterns (Fig. 2 \u25b6). All intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL-2000 package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997 \u25b6). A complete diffraction data set was collected to 2.6 \u00c5 resolution and the related data-collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 2 \u25b6.",

Interestingly, a functional mutant (N60K) of the nsp9 protein from MHV was identified by reverse-genetics methods and shown to compensate for viral growth defects caused by a 6 nt insertion (AACAAG) into the 3\u2032-UTR of the MHV genome (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008 \u25b6). Currently, the structural mechanism underlying this remains unknown. One hypothesis is that the N60K mutation may cause certain conformational changes within the nsp9 protein (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008 \u25b6). Initially, we cloned and expressed the nsp9 protein of MHV and the functional mutant (N60K). These proteins were then subjected to crystallization trials, but we failed to obtain any crystals. As a close neighbour of MHV, HCoV-HKU1 also belongs to group A of the Betacoronavirus genus. Since Asn60 of nsp9 is conserved in group A (Fig. 3 \u25b6), we then turned to the N60K mutant of nsp9 from HCoV-HKU1 to study the structural mechanism, especially considering that a high-quality diffraction data set for the nsp9 wild-type protein from HCoV-HKU1 had been collected previously (Wang et al., 2009 \u25b6), and we are currently carrying out structural studies on this protein.",

The final protein used for crystallization trials reached greater than 95% purity as monitored by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis. The crystals could be obtained from condition No. 40 of Index, which is different from the previously reported conditions (Wang et al., 2009 \u25b6). The optimized crystals diffracted to a highest resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 using 0.1 M citric acid pH 4.5, 25%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 with 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The crystals belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 31.9, b = 85.0, c = 95.0 \u00c5. Currently, there are several CoV nsp9 structures available in the Coronavirinae subfamily (Egloff et al., 2004 \u25b6; Sutton et al., 2004 \u25b6; Ponnusamy et al., 2008 \u25b6; Miknis et al., 2009 \u25b6). Among those, the primary sequence of SARS-CoV nsp9 (PDB entries 1qz8, Egloff et al., 2004 \u25b6; and 1uw7, Sutton et al., 2004 \u25b6) shows 45% identity to HCoV-HKU1 nsp9. Molecular replacement will be used to determine the structure of nsp9 from HCoV-HKU1 with the structure of SARS-CoV nsp9 as the search model. Based on the molecular weight of the monomer, the Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968 \u25b6) was calculated to be 2.54 \u00c53 Da\u22121 and the solvent content was 51.6%, assuming the presence of two molecules per asymmetric unit. Further structural and functional analysis of the mutant (N60K) of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 will lead us to better understand how this functional mutant could rescue a deficient insertion mutant.",
