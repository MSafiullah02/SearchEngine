The origins of stigma toward health conditions are complex. According to existing theories, a combination of interactive elements may bring about stigmatization. Briefly stated, they include perceived threat, information processing bias, self-interest, negative labeling, social communication of bias, exclusion, status loss, and power difference (Haghighat, 2001; Link & Phelan, 2001; Stangor & Crandall, 2000). Illnesses that are associated with more of these elements are conceivably more likely to be stigmatized.",

SARS is a novel infectious disease that broke out in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, before March 2003, progressed to involve 29 countries globally, and subsided in June the same year. Early in the epidemic, there were widespread fears that SARS would propagate uncontrollably, overwhelm public health resources, create global economic disasters, and kill millions of people. Media reports suggest that stigma and discrimination related to SARS were common in many domains of everyday life, such as the workplace, schools, health services, restaurants, and shopping malls. The perceived linkage between SARS and ethnicity led to the irrational avoidance of Asians (especially Chinese) in many parts of the world. Many countries likewise imposed excessively stringent restrictions on travelers from Asia (Moy, 2004; Singer et al., 2003; Stocking, 2003).",

Amoy Gardens (AG), in particular, held the world record of a residential complex with the greatest rise of infected cases in a single day. Being the first officially recognized site of the community outbreak in Hong Kong, this high-rise housing estate exhibited a disturbing toll of 329 confirmed cases of infection and 42 deaths (Hong Kong Government, 2003). Specifically, although AG consists of 19 separate blocks, 41% of its confirmed cases of infection and 52% of deaths occurred in Block E alone. Given the unique opportunity to study residents of AG in Hong Kong, the present study aimed to address several issues relevant to stigma connected with SARS and stigma in general.",

SARS has been portrayed as highly contagious, controversial in transmission, \u201cincurable\u201d, and conducive to serious sequelae of treatment (Meltzer, 2004). Unsurprisingly, scattered media reports suggested that residents of AG, in particular those of Block E, experienced different kinds of stigma and discrimination (Moy, 2004). We therefore attempted to document the nature of stigma experienced by the residents. Second, stigma may extend from an individual to those bearing different kinds of relationships to him/her (Goffman, 1968). Such \u201ccourtesy\u201d stigma may be based on genetic, contagion, moral, ethnic, and/or geographical reasons. Because of where they lived in the housing complex, subgroups of residents differed in their perceived risk for SARS. This allowed us to examine the phenomenon of associative stigma.",

In the case of SARS, the media had resources to raise alarm about and increase stigma toward those at high risk for SARS. Thus, the power of the media may become influential in the case of an epidemic and its consequent stigma. Finally, even in the presence of a major power differential between stigmatizers and the stigmatized, the latter are not necessarily passive recipients of stigma (Robin & Satterfield, 2002). Instead, they may resist or cope with stigma by utilizing tangible or symbolic resources available to them. The present study seeks to clarify how sociodemographic and proximity factors may shape stigma management strategies among residents of AG.",

Under the powerful influence of the media and the relative powerlessness of those stigmatized, associative stigma can broaden to a city, a country, a region, or an entire ethnic group perceived to be at high risk of SARS (Goffman, 1968; Singer et al., 2003; Stocking, 2003).",

This ingroup\u2013outgroup perception may be motivated by psychological and economic self-interest (Haghighat, 2001). It is shown by the attempt of AG residents to actively declare their non-Block E status in both interpersonal and work domains. Stigmatized individuals also use \u201cdownward social comparison\u201d to distinguish themselves from those who are in a worse situation than themselves (Gibbons, 1986). Thus, non-Block E residents may disown part of the severe stigma toward AG by declaring that not the whole of AG is as dangerous as Block E. This destigmatization strategy can bring them psychological dividends and become powerfully self-reinforcing (Miller & Major, 2000; Haghighat, 2001).",

For example, the mortality of SARS is infinitely lower than those of malaria and tuberculosis but the latter have received considerably less attention (Fumento, 2003). In the view of Chi-pon Wen, the enormous gap between the \u201cperceived\u201d risk and \u201cassessed\u201d risk of SARS has resulted in unnecessarily \u201cexpensive lessons\u201d for Taiwan. He emphasizes that the media focus throughout the crisis is biased by myths that propel public panic. Repeatedly making valid risk comparisons (e.g., motorcycle accidents and suicide claimed 4000 and 2200 lives a year but SARS only 71 in Taiwan) and managing misperceptions about risk, Wen proposes, will produce more efficient (and, in the authors\u2019 view, less stigmatizing) public health responses (Wen, 2003). Accurate risk communication has not, however, been a focus of SARS management in Hong Kong. Unsurprisingly, 64.6% of AG residents report dissatisfaction with the government's mode of handling health information and over 50% believe that biased media coverage has led to disproportionate stigmatization of AG.",

First, because of the difficulty of obtaining a random sample of subjects and a high response rate in an acutely stigmatized community, convenience sampling is adopted. The response rate of 18.5% is far from ideal. Depending on whether stigmatized individuals are more or less likely to respond, we may have either over- or under-estimated stigma experience. Second, as it is ethically and administratively problematic to carry out a prospective study during the SARS outbreak, we have used a retrospective approach. As such, the findings may not accurately capture the most vivid experience of stigma among AG residents. Third, although the interview data complement the survey data, the fact that only 2 Block E residents were interviewed limits the generalizability of our qualitative findings. Finally, stigma is a contested subject that can be studied from the often different perspectives of the stigmatized and stigmatizers (Heatherton, Kleck, & Hull, 2000). This holds true especially for a novel illness that truly threatens public health. Future studies should go beyond subjective stigma to examine the perspectives of government officials, health care workers, employers, school administrators and other stakeholders. They should also examine whether and how stigma toward SARS may decrease over time.",
