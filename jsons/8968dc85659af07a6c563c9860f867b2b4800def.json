The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published an article citing the benefits of the application of such feedback control theory [10] , which is evidence of concurrent thinking along our lines. However, their work is primarily based on studying the impact of fictitious controllers over a simple disease model, without considering the actual data from the current pandemic. Also, the studied controller needs a continuously changing value of the reproduction number R 0 , which is infeasible. We instead utilise a dynamical model of the disease that is being used by the New Zealand government [11] . We then propose controllers based on actual R 0 values being used by the same government in its decision making [4] . Likewise, we develop a methodology for R 0 values in Italy, which mimics the Italian government's actions. We then develop controllers to closely follow what is happening in an alternative setting, where unlike New Zealand the R 0 values used in decision making are not published openly.",

These ODEs capture the progression of a disease through the population, as people become infected, progress through their infection, and infect others. SEIR models include variables which represent the population during an epidemic which can be in a range of states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), pre-symptomatic (P ), infectious (I), recovered (R) and deaths (D). The infected and recovered cases are further categorized into untested (I u , R u ) and confirmed cases (I c , R c ) to enable control mechanisms which are specific to confirmed cases. The key parameter determining if a virus can cause an epidemic is the reproduction number R 0 and depends on both the transmissibility of the virus and social distancing. For R 0 > 1 the virus will spread until herd immunity has been established, while for R 0 < 1 the transmission will progressively decay until the virus is eradicated [9] . In addition to R 0 , further parameters are used for capturing aspects such as the fatality rate and testing rate.",

The formal nature of these models means that they can be used in simulation and code generation frameworks with relative ease [22] , [23] . Further, there exist definitions for Hybrid Networks [20] which enable the composition of multiple HIOAs to produce complex systems, rather than just individual components.

In contrast, control can remain in the Pre-LD mode, when the current time t is less than 6 days. The rate of change of time is modelled as an ODE\u1e6b = 1 within both modes. Transitions between modes happen when some conditions are satisfied. For example, the transition from Pre-LD to LD happens when the current value of t becomes 6. When a transition triggers, some variables are updated. For example, when this transition triggers, the value of time t is reset (by the reset action, which is denoted t = 0).

For example in Italy, the government does not have an explicitly outlined intervention system, instead the control actions are progressively released as they are needed. We use the published stringency index [12] for Italy across time in order to create an approximation of their control strategy in our framework. For example, on 23rd February 2020, the stringency index was listed as 66.67, while subsequent measures increased this to 71.43, 90.48, and finally 95.24 [12] . We create an approximate discrete controller for this approach (Figure 3a) , where the phases correspond to a degrees of stringency mentioned earlier.",

This likely indicates that there is a need for an additional phase between three and two for Italy, which is able to contain the disease without being as strict as phase three.

We have shown the ability of CCPE to model the dynamics of COVID-19 in conjunction with the various intervention techniques that governments employ. Table I compares the controllers used in this paper. As we can see, in the case of New Zealand, the controller NZ-C2 achieves much better overall outcome compared to the simple controller NZ-C1. While the lockdown for NZ-C1 lasts for over 120 days to achieve a near-zero infection count, the economic impact of such a long lockdown may be catastrophic. In contract, the controller NZ-C2 has a gradual lifting of restrictions, which reaches level 1 much faster. Also, the overall risk of this strategy is a marginal increase in the number of deaths. In contrast to these two controllers, is the third control strategy NZ-C3, which introduces oscillations. We can see immediately the impact of a poorly managed control strategy, which may lead to three orders of magnitude more deaths. Finally, we also present the controller for Italy, which is modelled based on the actions of their government and as reported in [12] .",

The maximum hospital capacity k u is 40,000. dk l3 , dk l2 , and dk l1 are 10, 5, and 0.01, respectively. Finally, in our results, we assume that a vaccine will arrive 365 days after 20th March 2020. At this time, the number of susceptible people decreases to zero, assuming widespread adoption of an effective vaccine. The conditions for increasing the alert level are based on the current number of infected cases (I c ). For example, from level two if I c \u2265 k l3 then the alert level immediately rises to three. On the other hand, the alert level can go down if the increasing rate of new cases per day (\u010a) is less than a certain amount. For example, from level three if\u010a \u2264 dk l3 then the alert level decreases to level two. In addition, to avoid frequent oscillations between levels, a minimum duration within a level before being able to drop down to a lower level is added and is set to be either 15 or 30 days.",

The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [12] provides a stringency index of the measures taken by various governments around the world. According to the stringency index of Italy's interventions, we divide the transmission trajectory into four phases. Considering that the initially reported cases are mostly imported rather than community transmission, the starting point of the analysis is 23rd February 2020, when the reported number of cases is 155. As a first attempt, we use the SEIR model [11] and curve fitting to estimate policy-specific reproduction numbers for Italy. We use the MATLAB R function lsqcurvefit to search for these reproduction numbers for each phase by minimizing the square of the residual error between the SEIR simulation and the reported data citedong2020interactive. The resulting reproduction numbers are listed in Table III . The controller is shown in Figure 3a . For dropping alert levels, we have values of 10, 5, and 0.01 for dk l3 , dk l2 , and dk l1 respectively. The population of Italy (N ) is 60,461,828 and we have level changing constraints of 6046, 3023, and 605 for k l3 , k l2 , and k l1 respectively. Additionally, the constraint to level four (k u ) is equal to the hospital capacity of approximately 483,694 [11] .",

The discrete controller has external inputs and outputs which mirror those of the plant model, having two inputs, I c and C dot , and a single output, R 0 . Listing 1b shows this controller captured in HAML, using locations for each of discrete modes that it can be in. When the number of current confirmed cases (I c ) reaches an upper bound for each location then the control progresses to a higher alert level, while when the change in number of cases (C dot ) reaches a lower bound then control transitions to a lower alert level. The values of R 0 for each control location are taken from Table II. Finally, composition between these two components simply requires mapping their respective inputs and outputs together.

From the initial state Phase 0, transition 1 leads to Phase 1. This transition is triggered based on time, according to the historical actions of Italy government. For instance, Italy was in Phase 0 on 23rd February 2020, and moved to Phase 1 by closing the schools and universities on 4th March 2020. Similarly, transitions 2 and 3 are triggered based on the time when historical actions were imposed. Countrywide lockdown was issued on 10th March 2020 and the nation entered Phase 2. On 20th March 2020, the government further tightened the control by reducing the public transportation and initiated Phase 3. For Italy, according to our estimation based on[12], the reproduction number R 0 is 6.3533 in Phase 0, 4.8051 in Phase 1, 3.2693 in Phase 2, and 0.5216 inPhase 3.",
