            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has emerged as a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (Lee et al. 2003). SARS has created international anxiety because of its novelty, ease of transmission in certain settings, and the speed of its spread through jet travel (Wenzel & Edmond 2003). Transmission is thought to be by droplet spread and by direct or indirect contact (Chan\u2010Yeung & Yu 2003). The main mode of introduction of SARS to countries around the world was via travellers on airplanes (Wilder\u2010Smith & Freedman 2003). The risk of in\u2010flight transmission of SARS became a major concern to the public and airline industry, and anxiety about this risk led to the near collapse of some airlines. We examined data from flights to Singapore with SARS patients on board in order to assess the risk of in\u2010flight transmission.",

In addition, Singapore introduced health declaration cards on 7 April to all incoming passengers from SARS\u2010hit countries, and from 29 April onwards to those of all countries. The purpose of these health declaration cards was not only to obtain recent travel and contact history, symptoms suggestive of SARS and recent intake of antipyretics, but also the flight seat and address in Singapore to facilitate contact tracing.",

Six of the nine travelers imported SARS to Singapore (from Hong Kong and Beijing) and three had acquired SARS in Singapore and were returning to Singapore (from New York, east Malaysia and Indonesia). However, only three airplanes (with four passengers) had symptomatic cases of SARS on board, whereas the passengers of the other flights developed symptoms within the first 2 days after arrival in Singapore. Of these three airplanes, two arrived before 24 March, i.e. before airport screening, quarantining and active surveillance was in place.",

Transmission was to one person only, and this was to a stewardess who had served and cleaned the tray of a passenger with SARS on the flight from New York to Singapore via Frankfurt (14 March). The passenger was a doctor who had treated the first admitted case of SARS in Singapore at a time when this new disease was not identified and no infection control measures were in place. At disembarkation, the passengers were briefed on symptoms of SARS and advised to seek prompt health care should they develop symptoms. None of the 82 passengers who disembarked in Frankfurt, or the 28 who disembarked in Singapore developed SARS (except for the wife and mother\u2010in\u2010law of the doctor who had close contact prior to the flight and both developed SARS).",

            "text": "Our limited experience of the three flights to Singapore with symptomatic SARS patients on board suggests that in\u2010flight transmission of SARS is not common. The low incidence of in\u2010flight transmission of SARS is consistent with the findings from mathematical modelling in Hong Kong and Singapore that the SARS coronavirus is only moderately transmissible, and that superspreaders contribute to the epidemic (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2003). Although one of the initially imported cases was a superspreader (transmission to 21 household contacts and health care workers) (Hsu et al. 2003) at the time of her flight she only had mild prodromal symptoms without cough. It appears that transmission mainly occurs when people have respiratory symptoms. None of the other cases except for the Singaporean doctor (transmission to two household contacts) resulted in secondary transmission. It is highly likely that the risk of in\u2010flight transmission would be enhanced with superspreaders on the plane. This may have been the case on the highly media\u2010publicized flight from Hong Kong to Beijing on March 15 where at least nine other passengers had contracted SARS from one passenger.",

Similarly, a new strain of influenzavirus on a cruise ship had an attack rate of 42% amongst crew members (Earhart et al. 2001).",
