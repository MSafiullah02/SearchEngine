It is the major cause for visits to pediatrician.1 A preschool-aged child has an average of 6 to 10 colds per year, and 10% to 15% of school-aged children have at least 12 infections per year. The greatest incidence is from early fall until the late spring,2 resulting in frequent absences from school.",

Additional symptoms of low-grade fever, sore throat, clear eye discharge, digestive discomfort, and general malaise may also be present.4., 5. Some common viruses that cause URI include rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and parainfluenza virus.3., 6., 7. Transmission varies with different viruses. RSV spreads primarily through contact with symptomatic children and contaminated objects; influenza spreads mainly via airborne droplets. The precise route of transmission for rhinovirus remains controversial.6\n",

In view of the self-limiting nature of URI and the trauma of daily injections, it is unlikely that interferon would be used to treat URI in children.38 Histamine antagonists are not indicated in the common cold.39 Antiinflammatory mediators11 and specific antiviral agents40 may be promising. Although viral URI is a benign illness of short duration, it can lead to bacterial complications\u2014otitis media, sinusitis and lower respiratory tract infections, or even mastoiditis and meningitis\u2014that have much more significant consequences in children.41., 42.

Between 1999 and 2004, 762 consults were provided to patients on the Pulmonary Service; the chief complaints initiating the consultation were pain in the back, upper body, chest, and neck as well as anxiety. During acute or chronic respiratory infections, chest, shoulder, neck, and back discomfort may develop from persistent cough.1., 2., 3. This pain or discomfort could lead to ineffective cough and deep breathing as a result of splinting.1., 2., 3. To help decrease the musculoskeletal pain associated with coughing, children experiencing respiratory infections could benefit from back, shoulder, and anterior chest wall massage therapy with particular attention to the intercostals, scalenes, serratus, pectorals, and trapezius. Should cough-related pain or discomfort extend to the abdomen, massage to the intercostals and external obliques may also be helpful. If children are splinting with cough or laughter or indicating it hurts too much to laugh, this would be a good indication to try some massage to improve their comfort level. Children experiencing respiratory illness may feel more comfortable in an upright position during treatment rather than lying down. To treat the child in an upright position, he or she can be positioned in a chair with the head supported by a table-top pillow or seated upright in the parent's lap with the head resting on the parent's chest or shoulder. Infants and young children can readily be treated while cradled on their parent's shoulder or chest.",
