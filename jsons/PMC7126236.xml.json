It comprises three herbs: Radix Scutellariae, Flos Lonicerae Japonicae and Fructus Forsythiae in a ratio of 1:1:2 (w/w/w) [4]. Since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes in 2003, commercial demand for SHL has steadily increased. The drug is produced by several manufacturers. The annual output of SHL by one of these manufacturers has reached 600 million bottles, with annual revenue of USD 500 million and an annual growth rate of 13.93% [5]. SHL has become the leading choice in preventing and treating the \u201cwind-heat\u201d type of common cold in China [6].",

As recorded in Chinese Pharmacopeia [4], baicalin for Radix Scutellariae, chlorogenic acid for Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, forsythin for Fructus Forsythiae are selected as the chemical markers for quality evaluation. The most widely reported qualitative and quantitative analyses of SHL for the purpose of quality control have been documented using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for assaying only major chemical markers such as baicalin, chlorogenic acid and forysthin [7], [8], [9]. Chinese patent drugs may consist of hundreds or even thousands of components which are responsible for the therapeutic effects by synergistic and/or antagonistic interaction. And SHL has a complex chemical profile with a wide range of components, including phenylethanoid glycosides, lignans, quinic acids, saponins and flavonoids [10]. All these components might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy in different ways. Thus, identification and quantitative determination of only three active markers are not sufficient for quality control of SHL. Although a study published the qualitative analysis of 27 constituents of SHL by high performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS) [11] and another study even detected 35 compounds, including prototype components and metabolites in human serum, after Shuang-Huang-Lian injection was administrated [12], no significant improvement in the quantitative analysis has been made.",

FDA approval depends on both analysis of the drug and quantification of its components. So far, only two botanical drugs, Fulyzaq and Veregen have been approved by the FDA. Both of these drugs have complex chemical profiles, yet up to 90% of the chemical components can be quantitatively determined [13], [14] and quality can be evaluated. If Chinese patent drugs, including SHL, are to win FDA approval, a higher level of quantitative analysis must be achieved. Being the product of a water decoction, SHL contains both small molecules and macromolecules, particularly a large amount of carbohydrates including monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Published analytical methods missed these carbohydrates and could not fully meet the requirements of FDA. Thus, developing more powerful qualitative and quantitative methods is urgent for bringing SHL into the international market.",

The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) under the present chromatographic conditions were determined at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of around 3 and 10, respectively. The repeatability and stability of the method were also evaluated for each analyte. The analysis was repeated six times in the same day and additionally on three consecutive days to determine intra-day precision and inter-day precision, respectively. The sample was stored at 25 \u00b0C, and analyzed at 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 36 h for stability test. RSD (%) = (standard deviation/mean) \u00d7 100%. A recovery test was used to evaluate the accuracy of the developed UHPLC\u2013Q-TOF-MS method. Accuracy was determined by adding the standard solution at three different concentration levels (120%, 100% and 80%) to SHL samples in which the contents of the 15 analytes were known. Then the samples were diluted with methanol and analyzed in parallel in accordance with the proposed method and triplicate experiments were performed at each level. The spike recoveries were calculated by the following equation: Spike recovery (%) = (total amount detected \u2212 amount original)/amount spiked \u00d7 100%.",

Their chemical structures are provided in Fig. 2\n. The high precision Ms/Ms fragments information obtained were listed in Table 1.

The peak areas in the extracted ion chromatograms of fifteen non-saccharide small molecules were calculated and put into calibration curves, which were generated by plotting peak areas and corresponding concentrations. And the peak areas shown by ELSD chromatograms were put into calibration curves of three saccharides, which were prepared by plotting the logarithmic of peak area against the logarithmic of corresponding concentrations. By multipling by 5000 of dilution times, then the concentration of each compound in commercial Shuang-Huang-Lian oral liquid can be known. The results are summarized in Table 3\n. The percentages of chemicals found in this study are summarized in Fig. 3\n. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3, the total contents of 18 analytes in batch C-1 reached 78.11%, for batches A-1 and A-2, the total contents of 18 analytes existed in a relatively low level which is close to 60%.

This study shows that the quality of commercial SHL is inconsistent. These variations may result from different aspects such as sources of raw materials, procedures of processing and manufacturing and standards of quality control for different manufacturers [17]. For example, three saponins (macranthoidin B, macranthoidin A, dipsacoside B) showed the greatest variation in the 12 samples. The amount of macranthoidin B in B-2 is 1.75 times more than B-3.

Only for samples from manufacturer C, we did not detect macranthoidin B and dipasacoside B or the content of dipasacoside B is relatively small, therefore we can deduce preliminarily Lonicerae Japonicae Flos was used to produce Shuang-Huang-Lian oral liquid.

This is important because, unlike artificial sweeteners, such as cyclamate, which can only affect taste, sucrose also shows synergistic antibacterial effect with anti-inflammatory ingredients [20].
