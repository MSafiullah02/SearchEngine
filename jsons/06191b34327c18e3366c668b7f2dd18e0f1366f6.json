In Canada, investigations of zoonotic disease incidents are often conducted by public health inspectors (PHIs). However, little is known about PHIs' knowledge of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, their perceptions of zoonotic disease importance or their education regarding zoonotic diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the knowledge, perceptions and education of Canadian PHIs regarding zoonotic diseases. Data were collected from December 2008-January 2009 using an internet-based survey distributed to members of the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors national listserv. Responses were received from 229 PHIs in four provinces, with a response rate of approximately 20%. The majority of respondents reported at least 10 years of experience in the public health sector, 80% (181/225) were in frontline positions, and 62% (137/222) were routinely involved in investigations of infectious diseases. Two-thirds believed that the importance of zoonotic diseases with regards to public health would increase in the next 5 years. Whilst most respondents were able to correctly identify animals capable of directly transmitting common zoonotic pathogens, there were gaps in knowledge, particularly with regard to rabies and transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens by companion animals. PHIs tended to feel that their training on zoonotic diseases prior to working as PHIs was deficient in some areas, or left some room for improvement. Their responses also suggested that there is a need for improvement in both the quantity and the quality of continuing education on zoonotic diseases. In particular, less than onethird of PHIs received ongoing continuing education regarding zoonotic diseases, and of those that did, nearly two-thirds rated the quantity and quality as only fair.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "Zoonoses, diseases that can spread under natural conditions between humans and other animals (Last, 2001) , are a major public health issue.

However, only recently has more attention been focused on other sources of zoonotic diseases such as household pets, although the majority of the population has regular contact with companion animal species and that transmission of organisms such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), hookworms, roundworms, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, dermatophytes, Leptospira, Bartonella spp. can occur between people and pets (Lefebvre et al., 2006; Weese et al., 2006; Brown and Prescott, 2008; Pickering et al., 2008; Reaser et al., 2008; Salb, 2008) .

The lack of incidence and outcome information hampers understanding of the true impact of many zoonotic diseases. Whilst it is well established that horses can carry both MRSA and Salmonella, the risk of opportunistic transmission of zoonotic illnesses from horses to humans is thought to be low (Bender and Tsukayama, 2004) , and PHIs who work outside of rural areas may not encounter horses in their investigations. However, persons who live in suburban or urban areas may have contact with horses at riding stables or petting zoos, and thus, the potential for animal contact should be investigated even in urban situations.

As feline hunting and male roaming behaviours increase the risk of cats having contact with rabies vectors, including raccoons and bats, and cats are less likely to be vaccinated for rabies than dogs (Moore et al., 2000) , it is important to consider cats a source of rabies.

Also, 3-13% of respondents did not associate Salmonella with turtles, other reptiles or poultry. Although it is encouraging that the majority of respondents did associate Salmonella with these species, the proportion that did not is still a concern given the potentially significant impact on public health caused Salmonella in these species.

Many PHIs incorrectly identified tickborne pathogens as being directly transmitted from animals.
