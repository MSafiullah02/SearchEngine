This is likely to result in financial consequences, as repetition of work will consume additional funding. Twenty-five percent of respondents reported at least 1 month and up to 6 months of work had been lost due to laboratory shutdown\u2014with large differences seen between wet lab (73%) and dry lab (31%) researchers. At the same time, levels of self-perceived productivity dropped, where dry lab scientists were much more likely to continue carrying out their work from home as expected (29% of dry lab scientists, but only 10% of wet lab scientists, reported \u201cat least 80% productivity\u201d). There was also a more pronounced increase in self-perceived levels of stress (during times of lockdown compared to before) among wet lab scientists, with higher increases seen in trainees and non-tenured professors. On the other hand, some respondents reported that their stress during the laboratory shutdown was lower than during their normal work routine, which could be explained by less frequent interruptions in their daily routine or perhaps reduced expectations from peers and lab heads to deliver results.",

We observed some differences between male and female scientists, with females reporting fewer productive hours. This is, in part, due to the higher rate of females among wet lab scientists (70% of female versus 60% of male respondents work primarily experimentally) and likely also reflects differences in childcare duties. This suggests a particular vulnerability of female scientists during an institutional shutdown. Another vulnerable group appears to be expatriates, especially trainees working in a life sciences institute located on a continent other than the one where their home country is. Thirty-four percent of these young scientists live alone, compared with only 14% of respondents working in their home country. These expatriates might feel more isolated and may also face potential problems with frequent updates to local regulations due to language difficulties.",

At all career stages, VC has gained importance in running group meetings or journal clubs and to meet collaborators. More than 90% of life scientists at all career stages reported in our survey that they were now more regularly making use of VC for these purposes. Nearly half of the respondents stated that their level of communication with their supervisor, mentor, or line manager had not changed (48%), whereas one fifth said it even increased (22%), which suggests that VC is fortunately heavily used and appears to be an effective means of communication and mentoring.",

Especially trainees reported that they have been making great use of opportunities for e-learning, including VC-based bioinformatics courses, with a higher rate of wet lab (72%) than dry lab (50%) trainees benefiting from e-learning during an institutional shutdown. This indicates that especially trainees normally based in the wet lab use the time of shutdown to expand their skillsets. This includes many young scientists now learning programming languages. For them, there is an opportunity to use the unintended break in their experimental work to develop into more interdisciplinary hybrid (wet/dry) data scientists.",

Indeed, there are early signs that manuscript submissions to scientific journals have already been increasing since COVID-19-related restrictions have emerged [4]. And somewhat impressively, over a hundred respondents (102, 18% of the total) indicated that they shifted the regular scientific activities to be able to directly contribute to research with the aim to combat COVID-19. A recent inquiry circulated among members of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) provides an independent testament of the willingness of life scientists to contribute to fighting COVID-19 (https://www.data-against-covid.org). This study also showed that life scientists actively support virologists, epidemiologists, and health care workers by contributing reagents, instruments, protective equipment, and IT infrastructure (such as high-performance as well as cloud computing platforms) or by providing clinical tasks and communicating with journalists and the public (https://www.embo.org/news/articles/2020/life-science-researchers-efforts-to-fight-covid-19).\n",
