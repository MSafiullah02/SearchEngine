In the direct method, a known serum with fluorescent antibodies supposedly corresponding to the sample under study-a specimen with the antigen-is deposited on the sample. In the case of the formation of the antigen-antibody complex, the attached antibodies are detected by luminescent microscopy in the form of a fluorescent signal with different degree of intensity determined visually by the researcher and depending on the number of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies attached to the cell. When performing indirect analysis, an immune serum non-labeled to the sought causative agent is deposited on the antigen. In the case in which the serum antibodies correspond to the antigen, an antigen-antibody immune complex is formed. Then, an antispecies serum with fluorochrome is deposited on the preparation. Thus, antibodies of the first serum serve as an antigen for labeled antibodies of the antispecies serum. The forming double complex is determined using a luminescent microscope. The indirect method is more universal because using a single fluorescent serum allows one to reveal different species of microorganisms.",

            "text": "Antibodies labeled by a fluorescent dye preserve the ability to enter into a specific reaction with a homologous antigen the position of which is determined using luminescent microscopy from the characteristic luminescence appearing after the excitation of the fluorescent agent by ultraviolet radiation. The main requirements to fluorochromes used for labeling of specific proteins are the distinguishability of their fluorescence color from the autofluorescence of the object under study, contrasting with the background, high fluorescence intensity after conjugation with the protein, and preservation of main physicochemical and serological properties of antibodies. For the fluorochrome, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [5, 6] , rhodamine sulfonyl chloride (RSC) [7, 8] , rhodamine sulfonyl fluoride (RSF) [9, 10] rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) [11, 12] , dichlorotriazinylamino-fluorescein (DCTAF) [13, 14] , etc., are used. Such organic compounds emit yellow-green, yellow, and red fluorescence. The dye that is most often used as a label of antibodies is FITC. This dye, the molecular formula of which is C 21 H 11 NO 5 S, causes a green fluorescence; it bonds covalently to biomolecules via the NCS functional group and has a high quantum yield [15, 16] . The maximums of the absorption and fluorescence wavelengths are 495 and 520 nm, respectively [17] ; owing to this, the background fluorescence of biological specimens is reduced to the minimum. Traditionally, preparation of conjugated antibodies is controlled using the fluorescent antibody method. It is also recommended to determine the dye/protein molar ratio for each conjugate by optical methods. In the absorption spectrum of a labeled antibody, the dye peak and the absorption peak of the antibody are present. To calculate the degree of labeling (the number of fluorochrome molecules introduced per one molecule of the antibody), it is necessary to measure the optical density of the solution at the absorption maximum of the antibodies (A AB ) and wavelength of the absorption maximum of the dye (A Dye ). The number of fluorochrome molecules per one molecule of the antibody is calculated [18] by the formula (1) where D ye \u03b5 AB /AB is the sought number of dye molecules per an antibody molecule, A Dye is the optical density of the sample at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the dye, A AB is the optical density of the sample at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the proteins (280 nm), \u03b5 AB is the molar extinction coefficient of the antibody at the wavelength of 280 nm (for IgG, 210000), \u03b5 Dye is the molar extinction coefficient of the dye at the wavelength of the absorption maximum (for FITC, 72000 M -1 cm -1 ), and CF 280 is the correction factor for the dye at the wavelength of 280 nm.",

In contrast to the absorption spectrum of serums without fluorescent labels, the characteristic absorption peak of antibodies was positioned closer to the shortwave band by 50 and 20 nm; in addition, a decrease in the absorption intensity by 60-70% on average was observed in this spectral range.
