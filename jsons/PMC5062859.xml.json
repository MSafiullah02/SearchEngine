BNYVV is a member of the newly proposed family Benyviridae and is a causative agent of rhizomania in sugar beet. This virus was first reported in Italy in 1966 [9], and was subsequently isolated in Japan in 1973 [10], and found to be transmitted by an obligate intracellular parasite protist vector, Polymyxa betae [11]. HEV and BNYVV both have positive sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA (+)) genomes, although that of BNYVV is segmented into 4-5 separate RNA fragments [12], compared to the monopartite genome of HEV. Comparative analysis of the HEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), methyltransferase and helicase protein sequences with other ssRNA (+) viral sequences also revealed a genetic relationship with rubella virus (RuBV) [8, 9]. These findings led to the initial inclusion of HEV within the \u201calpha-like\u201d supergroup of viruses, based on similarities in their RdRp, helicase and methyltransferase amino acid sequences and also the presence of a putative papain-like cysteine protease [8, 13].",

Ultimately this led to some confusion over the ancestry of HEV, which was partially resolved in 1997, when the Caliciviridae were then subsequently organized into five genogroups, annexing HEV into a distinct sub-family by itself, but still within the Caliciviridae [16] (Fig. 1).\n",

This finally resolved the problem of HEV being both a member of the \u201cPicorna-like\u201d supergroup and the \u201calpha-like\u201d supergroup. As more and more sequences became available, HEV was seen to be more and more distinct from other viral genera and families, and it was accorded its own genus (Hepevirus) by 2004 and then its own family (Hepeviridae) in 2009 [18, 19]. In 2014, the taxonomy of the Hepeviridae was reviewed again and the family was divided into two new genera: Orthohepevirus and Piscihepevirus, as discussed earlier [6] and in 2016, Smith and colleagues proposed reference sequences for HEV subtypes within the Orthohepevirus genus [20].

            "text": "Despite scrutiny of the non-structural protein encoding region, the origin of the HEV capsid remained unresolved, since the Benyviridae are non-enveloped rod-shaped plant viruses [12], whereas HEV capsids are T = 3 icosahedral in shape, with an estimated 180 copies of the capsid protein [21, 22]. It was not until 2011, that surprisingly the HEV capsid protein was shown to be most structurally related to capsids from members of the Astroviridae family of vertebrate-infecting viruses [23]. Astroviruses, like HEV, also have a T = 3 icosahedral capsid, but which belong with the \u201cPicorna-like\u201d supergroup of viruses. To this day confusion over the ancestry of HEV is still apparent, as the non-structural protein-encoding region is classified within the \u201calpha-like\u201d supergroup, in contrast to the structural region. Therefore, this study aimed to shed further insight into the evolution and origins of the Hepeviridae family in its entirety. We initially undertook both a phylogenetic approach and an updated analysis of the identity between the individual HEV proteins and other viral proteins. Here we provide evidence that the whole Hepeviridae family likely arose through an ancient recombination event, which could have occurred between plant and insect viruses, with the breakpoint at the junction that separates the non-structural from the structural encoding regions of the genome.",

Additional tBlastn searches were undertaken using the individual Orthohepevirus A HEV GI protein sequences (accession numbers NP_056780 to NP_056788 inclusive) to identify any other, more distantly related viral protein homologues encoded by these regions. In particular, we wanted to determine whether the 275 amino acid region of the HEV GI genome between amino acids 498-773, described above, comprising the papain-like protease sequence, the polyproline region and Z region (the intervening sequence), had any non-Hepeviridae viral homologues, since it was poorly conserved within the Hepeviridae (Fig. 3 and Additional file 1: Figure S1). This search revealed a number of previously unidentified homologies to proteins from several viral families other than those previously recorded (such as the Alphatetraviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae, Mesoniviridae and Virgaviridae families; Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) [8].

The Astroviridae capsid is also closely related to the Tymoviridae family of monopartite, T = 3 icosahedral plant viruses. Although the HEV RdRp sequence groups with members of the Benyviridae and RuBV, there is no relationship between the Hepeviridae capsids and capsid sequences from these viruses, which group well away from the Astroviridae cluster (Fig. 8). Indeed, capsids from viruses of the Benyviridae are helical in architecture, not icosahedral. This relationship can also be seen more clearly in the unrooted capsid tree (Fig. 9). In order to reduce the potential effects of saturation [35] due to the large scale phylogeny of all (+) ssRNA capsids (and their rapid mutation rates), an extended set of capsid sequences was analyzed again, this time including more Hepeviridae and Astroviridae sequences, but with fewer, more closely related families (Additional file 3: Figure S2). This analysis included 223 representatives from the Astroviridae, Benyviridae, Bromoviridae, Caliciviridae, Hepeviridae, Tombusviridae and Tymoviridae families (Additional file 2: Table S3). All of the families form individual clusters, except for the Bromoviridae strains. There is good branch support for several of the intrafamily clusters (Hepeviridae, Tymoviridae, Benyviridae and Caliciviridae), but this is weaker (<60 %) for the other intra- and interfamily clusters (Additional file 3: Figure S2). However, the Astroviridae and Hepeviridae group together, with the Tymoviridae linked to the Hepeviridae after apparent divergence from the Astroviridae cluster (Additional file 3: Figure S2).",

However, the alignment is poor, and subsequent advances in sequence alignment and enlarged databases have not led to the identification of any significant homologues to the HEV protease domain. Indeed, one of the most contentious issues regarding HEV is whether the ORF1 polyprotein is processed at all, either by its own protease or by a host protease. Evidence for in vitro processing of the HEV ORF1 has been reported in E. coli, in human HepG2 and S10-3 cells [38\u201340], in baculovirus cells [41] and using vaccinia virus expression systems [42]. However, in all of these studies, the levels of the putative processed proteins are low, and in some cases could be explained by host-cell protease degradation. A recombinant HEV protease purified from E. coli was found to be active on both the HEV capsid protein and the HEV polyprotein, although an inhibitor screen of this protease\u2019s activity led to the conclusion that it was a chymotrypsin-like protease, not a papain-like cysteine protease [43]. However, other studies looking at ORF1 processing in human and hepatic cells reported little or no processing [44, 45]. This data is consistent with the fact that, a specific histidine residue (H590), a key part of the catalytic dyad in papain-like cysteine proteases, is absent in the HEV enzyme [46]. Pertilla et al. [45] also suggests that the HEV polyprotein is not processed, and functions in a similar manner to the large multifunctional polyproteins of some plant viruses within the \u201calpha-like\u201d supergroup, consistent with its phylogenetic clustering (Figs. 8 and 9) [47]. Conversely, Parvez and colleagues used in silico modelling of RuBV and HEV proteases to identify a different catalytic dyad in the putative HEV papain-like protease. This study proposed that the catalytic dyad is C434-H443, which is homologous to the C1152-H1273 catalytic dyad in the RuBV protease [48]. Using mutational analyses, the conserved H443 was shown to be is essential for HEV viability [48]. In the current study, the H443 residue was found to be conserved within the Orthohepevirus A, but not across the Hepeviridae family. Irrespective of the functionality (or not) of the protease, its origin remains obscure due to the lack of any significant identity to non-Hepeviridae sequences.",

Since cysteine proteases are significantly represented as a subfamily within the larger deubiquitinase (DUB) enzyme family [52], this could well be the main function, even perhaps the only function, for the protease domain.",

It is also unclear whether the HEV macro and protease domains together derive from the same ancestral region, as is the case for the Coronaviridae and alphaviruses [14], where the macro domain is associated with the protease domain. Macro domains in animal cells have been associated with ADP-ribose metabolism, and post translational protein modification, but few viral families possess macro domains, and in those viral families that do, the macro domains do not appear to be related to any specific feature shared by these viruses (Coronaviridae, alphaviruses, Hepeviridae) [31]. Poly(ADP)-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins in cells, which can be triggered by viral infection, and acts as an apoptosis-inducing signal [53], and the HEV macro domain has been shown to bind poly(ADP), suggesting a potential role in preventing apoptosis in infected cells. Expression of a recombinant HEV macro domain in HEK293T cells inhibited poly(IC)-induced IRF3 phosphorylation, indicating that one of the HEV macro domain\u2019s function is as an IFN antagonist [51].",

The PPR is also involved in viral replication and adaptation, including host-specificity, but not infectivity [54, 55]. An increase in correlated genetic heterogeneity in the macro and polyproline regions has been observed in chronic HEV infection, relative to patients who cleared the virus, suggesting that these two domains are linked in some way in modulating the immune response [56]. Apart from the Hepeviridae, only rubiviruses have a similar arrangement of a PPR upstream of a macro domain, and the rubivirus PPR is also highly diverse genetically, and under positive selection [29]. It is conceivable that ancestral rubiviruses and Hepeviridae viruses at some point acquired or exchanged a PPR-macro domain, which has retained homology in the macro domain, for its shared function in host-virus interactions, but the PPR domain has evolved rapidly due to its host-specificity role.",

Like the AUD, the Z region is highly variable in both sequence and length outside Orthohepevirus A, but is conserved within the Orthohepevirus A group (>68 % identity across 119 residues). It is possible that the AUD-like region in Orthohepevirus A viruses has evolved with changes in host tropism, thus losing any conservation with other members of the Hepeviridae over time. Similar to the Z region in Orthohepevirus A, in alphaviruses a PPR follows the AUD, however unlike HEV both domains are downstream of the macro domain (Fig. 2). In the majority of Orthohepevirus A sequences, the Z region and PPR are both upstream of the macro domain and could have shifted through a translocation event. One exception within Orthohepevirus A is rabbit HEV, and outside Orthohepevirus A exceptions include ferret and rat HEV (Orthohepevirus C) and CTV (Piscihepevirus) which all have a small PPR region at the carboxyl end of the macro domain. This polyproline rich region was originally reported to be an insertion of an inert spacer sequence into the rabbit and rat genomes [58], but could in fact be a remnant from an incomplete PPR translocation event.",

A subsequent study [61] found that the turkey astrovirus spike protein (turkey astrovirus-2; genus Avastrovirus) was a structurally closer match to the HEV capsid, than was found with the previous study involving the human astrovirus capsid spike [60]. The present study however, showed that the porcine astrovirus capsid protein sequence was the closest homologue to the HEV capsid sequence, closely followed by the chicken astrovirus capsid (Fig. 7), and all the homologous Astroviridae capsids sequences had E values between 10-5 \u2013 10-12. Moreover, no other viral family capsid sequences had any significant homology to the HEV capsid. A reciprocal Blast search using a chicken astrovirus capsid sequence identified the HEV capsid as the closest homologue, and no other viral family capsid had any significant identity.

In addition, a recent metagenomics study of viral diversity in a lake has identified a unique hybrid virus, where an ssRNA viral capsid sequence has integrated into a circovirus-like DNA virus (RNA-DNA hybrid virus from Boiling Springs Lake, or \u201cBSL-RDHV\u201d) [68]. The capsid sequence in BSL-RDHV is most closely related to the capsids from multipartite nodaviruses, which mostly infect insects and fish, and to monopartite Tombusviridae capsids (plant viruses), and the remainder of the BSL-RDHV genome resembles circoviruses (infecting birds and mammals) [68]. RNA-RNA recombination in plant viruses and other viruses, and the relevant molecular mechanisms are well-known and well-documented [69]. Some families show high rates of recombination (Picornaviridae), and others low rates (Flaviviridae), or non-existent/undetectable (Leviviridae), nonetheless recombination is vital for generating population variability and maximizing survival [70].",

The most parsimonious evolutionary scenario, with regard to the exchange, or acquisition of capsid sequences by an ancestral Hepeviridae virus, might be that an ancient ORF1 RNA sequence, from a plant/insect virus ancestral to the Alphatetraviridae/Betaflexiviridae/Virgaviridae/Benyviridae families, underwent recombination with an ancestral Astroviridae capsid RNA sequence, resulting in a recombinant virus that had (fortuitously) similarly sized genome of a plant/insect virus. This virus likely retained capsid sequence packing signals and was able to be subsequently packaged into an astrovirus-like icosahedral capsid. Such a recombination event resulted in the ancestral Hepeviridae hybrid virus, comprising an astroviral capsid from the Picorna-like super-group, and a plant/insect non-structural polyprotein from a virus within the very different alpha-like super-group (Fig. 10). An obvious prerequisite of the above events is that the ancestral viruses involved infected the same host simultaneously; whether this permissive host was a plant, insect or possibly even a vertebrate is at present unclear.",

At some time a macro domain was acquired, probably by horizontal transfer, although the putative source is unclear, given the similar, (albeit low) identity to bacterial and alphaviral homologues. Whether this acquisition occurred before, or after the capsid exchange is unclear. This acquisition may have been accompanied by the \u201cprotease\u201d region, since these two domains are often closely associated, although no functional link between these domains has yet been demonstrated [14]. The PPR could also have been associated with the macro domain as discussed above. The orientation of the protease and macro domains in Hepeviridae viruses correspond to that seen in alphaviruses, but is the reverse of RuBV, whereas the PPR-macro domain organization in Hepeviridae matches that of rubiviruses, but not alphaviruses in general (which have a much smaller PPR region or lack the PPR altogether) [8, 47] (Fig. 10). Later still, the ORF3 phosphoprotein evolved from an alternate reading frame within the capsid sequence, which could have been present in the capsid region prior to recombination, or evolved afterwards. Subsequently, the evolution of ORF3 could have been influenced by host tropism, leading to the possible evolution of individual species within the Hepeviridae.",

These capsids share no homology whatsoever with the icosahedral astrovirus capsid.

In contrast to the Hepeviridae, the Togaviridae (including RuBV), have an alpha-like non-structural genomic region, but a flaviviral-like structural region of their genome (Fig. 10). Given that the two aforementioned recombination predictions likely led to the genesis of the Hepeviridae and the Astroviridae, it is tempting to speculate that the entire Togaviridae family could also have emerged this way. It may have occurred through a recombination event at the non-structural/structural border between viruses from families representing different viral super-groups; flavi-like and alpha-like super-groups.",

This study has also shed additional light on the intriguing evolution and ancestry of several viral families. We show that both the Astroviridae and Hepeviridae, and possibly the Togaviridae, have undergone ancient recombination events at the junction between the non-structural and structural encoding regions of the genome, resulting in their creation. It is likely other families have emerged this way and this could be uncovered with careful analysis of the ever-growing number of new viral sequences being accrued. Finally, based on the results found herein, we hypothesize that viruses from the alpha-like super-group, which usually infect plants and insects, gain an entirely new structure through recombination to enable tropism into new hosts within the animal world.",
