Although the role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown, multiple agents may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals.12 RV16 assay would provide clinicians with better infectious status of patients than RV15 or culture, resulting in the more effective prevention of such multiple infections.",

But they reported about 10% lower sensitivity of RV16 and RV15 for rhinovirus compared to ours. This might be caused by use of xTAG with good performance for rhinovirus as an arbitrator. As for influenza B, RV16 and RV15 sensitivity (97.1% and 97.1%, respectively) by Kim et al. were higher than those in our study (89.7% and 79.5%, respectively).21 In our study, three cases of influenza B, which were culture positive and the molecular assays negative, were detected. These seem to make such difference in sensitivities of influenza B. A case of 2009 H1N1 influenza positive by culture and negative by the ProFlu+ assay (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc., Waukesha, WI) was reported.22 Two site mismatches were found later between the probe used and target sequence. Such kind of mismatch might have happened in our influenza B cases.",
