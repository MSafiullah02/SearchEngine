Moreover, great interest has been dedicated to the identification of peptides as drug candidates. The number of peptides in the pharmaceutical industry is continuously growing and about 10% of the entire drug market is represented by peptide based drugs [1], [2]. Bioactive peptides can be derived from natural sources or can be discovered through rational engineering, high-throughput screening, or structure-based design starting from defined protein regions [3]. Among the many peptides playing a relevant role in biology, some show a high propensity for binding to lipid membranes due to their simultaneous hydrophobic and amphipathic nature.",

Primary amphipathic peptides correspond to the sequential assembly of a domain of hydrophobic residues with a domain of hydrophilic residues divided by a spacer domain; while secondary amphipathic peptides are generated by the conformational state which allows positioning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on opposite sides of the same molecule. In particular, amphipathic, hydrophobic peptides present one face with large and aromatic residues and the other with small residues such as Ala/Gly. This distribution of amino acid residues facilitates the membrane interaction and peptide insertion into the bilayer [6].",

Both helical arms are amphipathic with bulky hydrophobic residues facing the membrane interior. The conserved N-terminal glycine residue is critical for fusion and for the correct structure of the peptide inside the membrane; in fact, when it is mutated to a valine the N-terminal helix is partially unwound and the fusion peptide is inactive [28].",

For instance, studies performed on the Ebola fusion peptide, show that the conformational transition from an \u03b1-helix to a \u03b2-sheet is induced by a change in the peptide to lipid ratio in the membrane [29]. At low peptide concentration in lipids, it is essentially an \u03b1-helix; while as the local peptide concentration increases in the membrane, the proportion of \u03b1-helix drops off in favor of a mainly antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure. This concentration dependent effect on peptide conformation might be of biological relevance [29].",

Many studies suggest that multiple mechanisms may take place simultaneously. Indirect ways in which interfacial binding peptides can affect viral entry have also been hypothesized. Self-oligomerization of membrane embedded fusion peptides has been proposed to be responsible of inhibition [52], [53]. The most studied case is that of HIV, where the inhibition has been attributed to the formation of structurally defined oligomeric complexes [54], [55]; while mutants with a lower helical content and tendency to self-associate into \u03b2-sheets [56] are able to inhibit membrane fusion at various stages.",

Nevertheless, crossing of the cellular membranes remains one of the major obstacles for the proper delivery of therapeutics [59], [60]. The lipophilic nature of biological membranes restricts the direct intracellular delivery of most compounds; whereas small molecules and ions can diffuse across the bilayer, larger molecules are generally excluded from simple diffusion into the cell. The differing hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the lipid membrane renders the transfer across this barrier extremely difficult due to differences in solubility. Notwithstanding the therapeutic potential of a number of novel molecules, their pharmaco-distribution properties hamper the possibility to reach the stage of pharmaceutical preparations and stimulate industrial interest; in fact, these molecules need to be delivered intracellularly to exert their therapeutic action inside the cytoplasm or onto individual organelles. It is, thus, evident that the therapeutic potential of a drug is largely dependent on the development of delivery tools able to selectively and efficiently carry it to target cells with minimal toxicity.",

Membrane fusion and its disruption are related processes, although leakage and fusion capacities of peptides do not always correlate and the features/activities of membranotropic peptides may depend on particular environmental and temporal conditions. Since not all membranotropic peptides are able to cross the membrane bilayer, it is essential to identify structural characteristics of hydrophobic peptides know to enter the cell membrane to highlight any feature that is involved in the penetration which may help in the design of novel delivery tools. Thus, an important feature to consider is the structural requirements for cellular uptake and the ability of membranotropic peptides to interact with the cell surface and lipid moieties of the cell membrane. A very complete review describing the binding and translocation of membrane active peptides has been recently published [64] which highlights the fact that peptide translocation is not coupled with dye flux. Graded dye flux would occur concomitant with peptide translocation, which would explain incomplete dye release; whereas all-or-none flux would occur with peptides unable to translocate, and therefore these peptides accumulate on the membrane until a rupture point is reached, resulting in complete dye release [64].",

The peptide contains residues crucial for its capacity to interact and destabilize target lipid membranes. It is rich in hydrophobic residues including glycines, leucines, alanines, and aromatic residues such as tryptophan and tyrosines, which are known to be located preferentially at the membrane interface. The peptide\u2013lipid interactions are initiated by the arginine residue located at the C-terminus; in fact, when the arginine is mutated, the fusogenic activity of the peptide is strongly impaired. The hydrophobic domain is also crucial for its insertion into the membrane and further supports the view that hydrophobic interactions between fusion proteins and cell-membrane phospholipids initiate membrane perturbation in the early stages of viral fusion. The many biophysical experiments performed on gH625 have shown that the peptide interacts with model membranes, penetrates the bilayer from its N-terminal side, has a tryptophan residue buried inside the bilayer, and adopts a helical conformation with its hydrophobic residues on one face of the helix and polar or charged residues on the opposite face [40], [49], [50].",

The presence of a histidine residue at the N-terminus of the native sequence strongly increases the fusion activity [50]. The importance of a single histidine residue as a switch for triggering viral fusion was also reported for other viruses [95] such as paramyxoviruses, therefore supporting the importance and specificity of the histidine moiety in activating fusion. Furthermore, a conserved histidine in one of the fusion loops of Semliki Forest virus E1 protein was found to be fundamental [96]. The histidine in gH625 both helps the initial interactions with the membrane and the oligomerization process [50]. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the histidine is located at the N-terminus and correct configuration of the N-terminal fusion peptide appears to be crucial for the fusogenic function of several fusion proteins as well as its location in the membrane core after peptide-bilayer interaction. The addition of one histidine at the N-terminus of gH625 is sufficient to make the peptide approximatively 8-fold more active. In particular, the addition of any other residue at the N-terminus impaired the fusion ability of the sequence (data not published).",

Moreover, gH625 does not have any activity in virus preincubation experiments, indicating that an eventual binding partner site on the pre-fusion gH protein is probably hidden and not available to interactions with free peptides, as also demonstrated by the analysis of the gH crystallographic structure.",

The 50% inhibitory concentration was 100 and 300 nM against HSV-1 and HSV-2 respectively, with no evidence of cell toxicity at these concentrations, indicating that the functionalization of a dendrimer with a membranotropic peptide represents a promising strategy for inhibition of viruses of the Herpesviridae family. The multivalent display of gH625 on the dendrimer scaffold results in an almost six fold increase of antiviral activity for HSV-1 and two fold for HSV-2 in comparison to the activity of the dendrimer itself, and more than 100-fold increase in the activity of the unsupported peptide. The cytotoxicity profile measured by the MTT assay showed that the peptidodendrimer is not toxic to Vero cells up to the highest concentration investigated in antiviral testing, while some toxicity was observed for the unfunctionalized dendrimer, especially at higher concentrations, demonstrating another advantage of the peptide functionalization [97]. Any inhibitory activity was excluded when the compounds were added at a post-entry step and also when cells were pre-treated with the dendrimer derivatives, indicating that both the peptidodendrimer and the dendrimer are not able to interfere with viral replication once the virus has gained access to the cellular milieu. The peptidodendrimer might sterically hinder the gH relative domain, either in a pre-fusogenic or in an intermediate conformation, preventing a complete and functional interaction between gH and the membrane to fuse. The mechanism of inhibition may involve binding to gH itself through oligomerization of the gH625 domain present on the glycoprotein or interaction with other glycoproteins present on the virion envelope, such as gB or gD.",

Their surface modification by means of conjugation or adsorption of a biospecific ligand, may allow their delivery to specific sites and modulation of drug release minimizing toxic effects and increasing intracellular bioavailability [111]. Thus, the dendrimeric scaffolds may be a promising tool for an efficient drug delivery engine. Little information is available on the mechanism of dendrimer uptake and intracellular trafficking [112]. Studies performed on PAMAM dendrimers [113] and PAMAM dendrimers functionalized with the TAT [114] indicate that endocytosis mechanisms contribute to the internalization and intracellular trafficking and that adding the TAT failed to enhance delivery efficiency. The attachment of gH625 to the termini of a poly(amide)-based dendrimer allows the conjugate to penetrate into the cellular matrix, whereas the unfunctionalized dendrimer is excluded from translocation. The peptide-functionalized dendrimer is rapidly taken into the cells mainly through a non-active translocation mechanism [101].

To address this issue, in vivo studies are necessary, thus validating design strategies and facilitating optimization and further functionalization. Although numerous studies showed that gH625 is an efficient carrier for bioactive cargoes in vitro [121], these results did not guarantee that it can be developed into a useful pharmaceutical delivery platform. The ability of gH625 to cross the BBB in vivo was also recently evaluated [122]. gH625 was administered in vivo to rats and its presence in the liver and in the brain was detected. Within 3.5 h from its i.v. administration, gH625 can be found beyond the BBB in proximity of cell neurites. gH625 has no toxic effect in vivo, since it does not affect brain maximal oxidative capacity and mitochondrial respiration rate. The data suggest that gH625, for its ability to cross the BBB, represents a novel nano-carrier system for drug delivery to the central nervous system. These results open new possibilities for direct delivery of drugs into patients in the context of theranostics and might address the treatment of several human diseases.",

A bradykinin analogue has also been reported to increase the penetration of small molecules by transitory opening of the BBB [125]. gH625 is the first viral membranotropic peptide which was shown to be a potential delivery system for macromolecules in vivo; these results coupled with previous in vitro data support the view that gH625 enters the BBB without involving endocytic processes.

Till now, gH625 is the only membranotropic peptide that has been extensively used for many applications and among them as a drug delivery system for the brain. In the development of new therapies to treat brain pathologies, the BBB represents a major obstacle against the use of potential drugs for treating disorders of the CNS due to the impermeable nature of the cell membranes of this compartment to several molecules [115], [126]. The data reported on the in vivo application of gH625 for brain delivery, support the novel view that synthetic peptides derived from viral membranotropic sequences can be used successfully to deliver biologically active substances inside the BBB.",
