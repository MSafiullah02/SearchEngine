Chaplains provide patients with a multitude of essential services including moral, emotional and psychological support, religious and spiritual guidance, and assistance to the patient\u2019s family\u2014all in an effort to relieve suffering and to help patients and their family engage their coping resources to face difficult life circumstances (Chang et al. 2012). Jeuland et al. (2017) conducted a national survey in the US to assess chaplain integration into palliative care and their work activities in this setting. The researchers found that over half of the chaplains in the study indicated that they frequently participated in palliative care rounds, provided care for patients at the time of death, visited patients to build relationships, engaged in goals of care conversations and assisted patients with spiritual matters. However, patients are not the only ones interacting with chaplains in healthcare settings. Chaplains frequently provide consultation and support to medical staff in palliative and hospice care, intensive care units (ICU), cardiothoracic intensive care units and other medical care settings. The physicians, allied health employees and support staff in such workplaces are often confronted with death and dying and have to make difficult decisions, which may contribute to their suffering in the form of burnout, stress, vicarious trauma, moral distress and compassion fatigue (Pereira et al. 2011).",

Research suggests that burnout, psychosocial distress, and compassion fatigue are high among medical staff including oncology physicians, nurses, social workers, hospice and palliative care physicians, and other health workers (Brindley et al. 2012; El-bar et al. 2013; Hooper et al. 2010; Lyckholm 2001; Najjar et al. 2009; Shanafelt and Dyrbye 2012; Sherman et al. 2006). Campbell et al. (2001) for example, utilizing a sample of 582 American surgeons, found that 32% had increased levels of emotional exhaustion and 13% experienced high levels of depersonalization. Stress and burnout in health care employees result in decreased job satisfaction and increased rates of turnover (Coomber and Louise Barriball 2007; Grunfeld et al. 2000; Whitebird et al. 2013). Pfaff et al. (2017) have shown in their preliminary study that a compassion fatigue resiliency program was effective in mitigating healthcare employees\u2019 clinical stress in a cancer center.",

The results showed that nurses considered conscience to be a major factor in their work serving as an influencing force, a restricting component and an antecedent of sensitivity. Nurses perceived that conscience was critical in influencing their behaviors toward patients and their family guiding their efforts to provide exceptional care. A questionnaire study of how personnel in various healthcare settings perceive conscience (i.e., where people think conscience comes from and what its qualities and functions are) showed that it was often viewed as an authority and a useful and valuable guide but also a burden, and a warning signal demanding attention (Dahlqvist et al. 2007).",

(2016) investigated the benefits and challenges of having internal medicine residents and chaplain interns participate in an inter-professional curriculum in the clinical setting. One of the main findings was that the medical team perceived chaplains to be an essential source of emotional support, particularly in difficult circumstances such as when dealing with death and dying in the hospital. In another qualitative study utilizing a phenomenological design, Taylor et al. (2015) examined the shared experience between hospital chaplains and hospital-based healthcare providers who received spiritual care from the chaplains. The results showed that chaplains often helped providers in both professional (e.g., hospital decisions) and personal matters (e.g., the death of a relative). Moreover, Taylor et al. (2015) found that providers appreciated having chaplains in the hospital and all the help they provided to both patients and hospital employees including personal spiritual matters, listening to problems and providing non-judgmental and emotionally supporting presence. In a small pilot intervention study, Charlescraft et al. (2014) found that chaplains served an important role for pediatric intensive care nurses and improved their ability to cope with stress at work.",

We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous survey utilizing a purposive sampling strategy targeting nursing staff who have routine access to a chaplain through daily rounds. We did not implement a probability sampling method, which would have enhanced the external validity of our findings. Moreover, the median age of 36 for the participants in our study is younger than the 42.8 median reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017) for hospital employees, which further limits the generalizability of our findings to younger medical employees in the hospital setting. Another limitation is the small sample size. Future studies may consider sending electronic survey links to improve survey response rates. Online survey methodology would ease the burden of completing a survey during working hours for staff who are already stressed. However, even with the small sample size, we were able to answer our most important research questions. Future studies utilizing larger sample sizes need to be conducted to characterize better the relationship between interacting with a chaplain and indicators of stress in hospital staff. A strength of the study was that the instruments used had excellent psychometric properties including validity and reliability, which enhances the study\u2019s findings.",
