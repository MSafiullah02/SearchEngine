            "text": "The importance of trade in the propagation of business cycles has received considerable attention in international macroeconomics, dating back to the writings of Kindleberger (1962) and Meltzer (1976). Recent empirical studies have found evidence of a positive link between the bilateral volume of trade and business cycle synchronization (see, for example, Frankel and Rose, 1998; Clark and van Wincoop, 2001; Baxter and Kouparitsas, 2005; Kose and Yi, 2006). Various theoretical mechanisms have been examined that generate, under certain conditions, a positive link between international trade and international business cycle comovement, including dependence on foreign inputs, common external shocks such as changes in oil prices, aggregate demand shocks, and other aggregate shocks whose cross-country correlation is related to the extent of international trade (see, for example, Backus et al., 1995; Baxter, 1995; Stockman and Tesar, 1995; Backus and Crucini, 2000; Kose and Yi, 2006). In this paper, we examine an alternative mechanism. We argue that pairs of countries that are more engaged in production sharing also exhibit higher comovements of business cycles. We measure this positive link in the data and quantify its importance in a model of international business cycles.",

According to industry analysts, a quarantine of China would have meant \u201cnuclear winter to the semiconductor and electronics industry.\u201d3\nSimilarly, production of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner involves a supply chain of 50 suppliers on four continents, with final manufacture taking place at Boeing plants in Everett, Washington. Foreign suppliers account for roughly 70% of the parts needed to manufacture the airplane. Boeing makes foreign suppliers aware that failure to deliver a particular component can result, and has resulted, in a shutdown of the production line.4\n",

            "text": "Despite these illustrations of global production sharing and cross-border interdependencies, it is difficult to systematically measure the extent of production-sharing activities at business cycle frequencies. In this paper, we measure production sharing using trade flows between US multinationals and their foreign affiliates, as well as trade flows between the United States and Mexico through maquiladoras. These imperfect, yet informative, measures of production sharing have been used by other researchers, including Chen et al. (2005) and Hanson et al. (2005). We summarize the data on the extent of production sharing and its connection to the business cycle as follows. First, trade flows associated with production sharing are more correlated with US manufacturing output than are trade flows that are not associated with production sharing. Second, for a large cross-section of countries that host US affiliates, those with larger production-sharing trade links with the US also have higher manufacturing output correlations with the US. Third, for these countries we find that the share of production sharing in trade is at least as important as the total volume of trade in accounting for bilateral manufacturing output correlations.",

Our model extends the framework of Backus et al. (1995)\u2014henceforth BKK\u2014to allow for these links in production. A key assumption in the model is that the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign intermediate goods is relatively lower if there is a production-sharing arrangement between locations. In particular, we assume that the location of plants and assembly lines are unresponsive to shocks at business cycle frequencies, creating a tight dependence of the production chain on inputs from a particular source. This complementarity in the production of the vertically integrated final good mutes substitution effects stemming from aggregate shocks to relative costs across countries.5\nConsistent with our data, the model generates a higher comovement between production-sharing trade flows and output in the source country relative to non-production-sharing trade flows. The model also produces a positive link between the share of production sharing in total trade and output correlations in manufacturing. This link, however, is lower than the positive link generated by the model between overall trade volumes and output correlations in manufacturing industries, with the extent of the difference depending on how production-sharing trade flows are accounted for in measures of trade flows.",

It differs from Frankel and Rose (1998) and other empirical work that studies the positive link between the share of trade in GDP and output correlations by focusing on the relation between the production-sharing intensity of trade and output correlations in manufacturing. Kose and Yi, 2001, Kose and Yi, 2006 show that in a standard model of international business cycles, trade has a very small effect on overall cross-country GDP correlations given the small shares of trade in GDP for most countries. We focus on manufacturing industries, which have higher trade shares, and show in our model that increasing the share of trade has a bigger impact on GDP correlations in the presence of production-sharing trade. Our work also relates to studies of international business cycles that examine the impact of differing degrees of substitutability in traded intermediate inputs on business cycles (see, for example, BKK, Ambler et al., 2002, Heathcote and Perri, 2002).6\nOur paper motivates differences in the degree of substitution between inputs based on the extent of production sharing in bilateral trade flows. Other related work that studies macroeconomic models of vertical integration and trade include Yi (2003), focusing on the increase in trade volumes over time, and Bergin et al. (2007), focusing on the higher volatility of production-sharing industries in host, relative to source, economies.7\n",

Foreign-owned firms were granted the right to set up production in the region and to import materials and equipment duty-free under the proviso that the goods would be re-exported. Not all maquiladoras are majority owned by US corporations, so these data complement the information in Table 1 based on US multinational data only. The maquiladoras are an important source of employment and export-oriented growth for Mexico, with their exports accounting for half of all non-oil exports from Mexico and one-third of manufacturing employment.13\nThe US is the predominant trading partner with maquiladoras, accounting for roughly 90% of total maquiladora exports in 1998 (Bendesky et al., 2003).",

The correlation between the log of the import/export ratio and the PPI-based RER (deviations from a quarterly HP trend) is 0.77.

Rows 3\u20134 relax the extremely high complementarity between home and foreign inputs in the production-sharing composite, holding the elasticity in the other composite at 2. In particular, we assume an elasticity of substitution equal to 0.5 and 1, respectively. In both cases the coefficient on production-sharing drops, while the coefficient on the export share increases slightly. Row 5 assumes an elasticity of substitution equal to 1 in the vertically integrated composite, and an elasticity of substitution equal to 4 in the horizontally differentiated composite. This perturbation of the model also lowers slightly the positive coefficient on s2P. Overall, the model implies a positive link between s2P and corrzT if \u03b6<\u03c1.\n",

This paper asks whether production sharing has a significant effect on the transmission of business cycles across national borders. Data on flows between US multinationals and their foreign affiliates, as well as between the United States and Mexican maquiladoras, suggest that trade related to production sharing has a correlation with foreign manufacturing output that is higher than for non-production-sharing trade. The data also suggest that production-sharing intensity is at least as important as trade volume in accounting for bilateral manufacturing output correlations. An important task for future research is to assess the robustness of these empirical findings using detailed data on production sharing, including arms-length transactions, and with more information on the extent of substitutability between inputs and processes.",

A key assumption is that home and foreign inputs are less substitutable in the production of vertically integrated goods than in horizontally differentiated goods at business cycle frequencies. The model is consistent with our empirical findings that exports to a particular country used in the production of the vertically integrated good are more tightly linked to the aggregate fluctuations of that country than exports used in the production of the horizontally differentiated good. Our model generates business cycles that are more synchronized between pairs of countries with a higher share of international trade in inputs utilized in the production of vertically integrated goods than between pairs of countries where trade is dominated by inputs used to produce horizontally differentiated goods.",
