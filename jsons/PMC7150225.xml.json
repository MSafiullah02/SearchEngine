            "text": "For the most part these possibilities were actually stark realities of what some bioweapons experts refer to as the Soviet Superbug program. As discussed in chapter Seeds of Destruction, while the United States and her allies were dismantling their bioweapons programs in the 1970s, the Soviets, under Biopreparat, were assembling a huge bioweapons production capacity, comprising dozens of production facilities and as many as 60,000 personnel. This massive program aimed to build offensive capabilities by mass producing many of the Category A and B agents. More important, the Soviet bioweapons program also created research institutions with top secret goals and objectives to use biotechnology toward creating pathogens and toxins with superior capability. As we know now, the Soviets were producing Bacillus anthracis spores by the ton. We know that Soviet strains of B. anthracis were engineered to carry a form of antibiotic resistance; however, we did not know whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conventional anthrax vaccine was effective against all Soviet variants. Ken Alibek, a former high-ranking official in the Soviet bioweapons program, testified in 1998 before the US Congress (Alibek, 1998). Here is a chilling excerpt of what he had to say:It is important to note that, in the Soviet\u2019s view, the best biological agents were those for which there was no prevention and no cure. For those agents for which vaccines or treatment existed\u2014such as plague, which can be treated with antibiotics\u2014antibiotic-resistant or immunosuppressive variants were to be developed.\n",

            "text": "Another famed Soviet bioweapons expert and researcher, Dr. Sergei Popov, was interviewed by a journalist from the public television show NOVA. (An excerpt from the interview, entitled \u201cCreating \u2018Superbugs\u2019,\u201d can be accessed on the Internet; see NOVA, 2001.) In the interview, Popov admitted that the Soviets were producing synthetic genes to give microbes properties that they did not possess in nature. When Popov was asked by the interviewer \u201cWhat would be the point of that?\u201d he replied, \u201cImagine a new weapon which is difficult to diagnose initially and then which is impossible to treat with conventional antibiotics.\u201d Popov explained that \u201cthe idea was that a new weapon has to have new and unusual properties, difficult to recognize, difficult to treat.\u201d By his own admonition, the goal of his research program was to create a more deadly biological weapon. He briefly described the goal of Project Bonfire, which dealt with the creation and potential exploitation of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Under Project Bonfire, the Soviets were able to produce a strain of Yersinia pestis that was shown to be resistant to almost 10 antibiotics. Furthermore, a recombinant strain of anthrax had resistance to 10 antibiotics. In the Hunter Program, Popov explained that whole genomes of different viruses were being combined together to produce completely new hybrid viruses. They wanted to combine two microorganisms in one (eg, a combination of encephalomyelitis virus and smallpox). This completely artificial agent would purportedly manifest as illness with new symptoms, probably with no known way to treat it. One might ask what would be the purpose and danger of this. In Popov\u2019s own words:Essentially, the major feature would be a kind of surprise effect. Nobody would recognize it. Nobody would know how to deal with it. But nobody could predict the result of that kind of genetic manipulation.\n",

            "text": "As for the term superbug, how does this exactly work? The concept sounds reminiscent of the legend of the Trojan horse. Popov explained the idea was to create a bacterial agent that harbored a virus. The virus would remain silent until the bacterial infection is treated. Therefore if the bacterial disease was recognized and treated with an antibiotic, there would be a release of virus. After the initial bacterial disease was completely cured, there would be an outbreak of a viral disease on top of this. According to Popov, a good example of this superbug model would be plague bacteria, which is relatively easy to treat with antibiotics, and viral encephalomyelitis inside. So, in case of biological attack, people would be treated against plague, and after that, the weakened host would manifest with a highly fatal infection affecting the brain and central nervous system. Remember that the encephalitides are normally transmitted by arthropod vectors, making them unlikely candidates and impractical for biowarfare. In the superbug model, the need for a vector is eliminated. Regardless, imagine the insidious nature of this scenario and the resultant fear, panic, social disruption, medical management issues, and implications for public health.\nCritical ThinkingBiotechnology today is capable of most of the possibilities about which the Jason Group warned us. Some genetically engineered agents may have already been produced and stockpiled by bioweapons experts in the former Soviet Union. Consider these scenarios or possibilities:\u2022What if an agent could be developed that specifically targeted one or another population group? Or, what if some group could be protected against infection in advance?\u2022What if one could engineer a viral disease with the lethality of a hemorrhagic fever virus but the communicability of influenza?\u2022What if a highly lethal disease such as smallpox was hard to diagnose because it did not form pustules?\u2022What if a pathogen was designed to give a false-negative result on a gold standard diagnostic assay?\u2022What if a highly lethal pathogen with a short incubation period had never even been encountered before? How long would it take public health officials to develop a new diagnostic test and write a case definition?\u2022What if some pathogen could produce a localized outbreak then render itself harmless? Conversely, what if a pathogen could continually alter itself in such a way as to evade treatment?\n\n",

            "text": "Concerns for the future of bioterrorism and bioweaponry remain very strong. This has been enhanced by some recent developments in what has become known as \u201csynthetic biology.\u201d Synthetic biology means different things to different people and groups of technical professionals. However, in the current context, the definition we will embrace here is as follows: the assemblage of natural molecules into a system that acts unnaturally. In essence, efforts in synthetic biology strive to build artificial biological systems for engineering applications using many of the same tools and experimental techniques. However, the work is fundamentally an engineering application of biological science. The focus is often on ways of taking parts of natural biological systems, characterizing and simplifying them, and using them as a component of a highly unnatural, engineered, biological system. So what is the danger in this? Imagine the construction of a microbe that can consume toxic substances (eg, petroleum products, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic) to clean up the environment. Furthermore, imagine a well-funded and scientifically capable small group of terrorists perusing the scientific literature for the genomic sequencing information that enables human or animal pathogens to evade the immune system of the host, resist antimicrobial treatments, or more efficiently adhere to and invade epithelial tissues. Then imagine using this information to engineer the ultimate pathogen in a laboratory, mass produce it, and package that into a deadly bioweapon.\nCritical ThinkingThe \u201cde-skilling\u201d of molecular biology techniques coupled with genomic sequencing data access and DNA synthesis services make biology increasingly accessible to people operating outside of well-equipped professional research laboratories (Landrain et al., 2013). The emergence of do-it-yourself (DIY) biology communities has come to epitomize this supposed trend toward greater ease of access and the associated potential threat from rogue actors.It seems that the \u201cgenie is already out of the bottle.\u201d What can be done to mitigate the threat of unregulated laboratories conducting research using synthetic biology procedures and services?\n",

It has also been argued that the \u201cde-skilling\u201d implied in synthetic biology may encourage the design of criminal bioweapons by facilitating their creation (Tucker, 2011). Such an argument relies on the idea that it would be possible to engineer pathogens without having a basic practical knowledge that is necessary in most laboratory practices. Several recent articles on this controversial subject tend to take one view or another: enhanced scientific research to be \u201cused\u201d for peaceful purposes or something that could be \u201cmisused\u201d, which leads to a substantial increase in \u201cdual-use\u201d threats.

In fact, between 2008 and 2014 the US government invested more than $800 million dollars in synthetic biology research (HHS, 2014). The Department of Defense, specifically within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, has accounted for most of that funding. The Wilson Center completed a study in 2015 that shows that there has been very little focus on risk research with these monies. Indeed, less than 1% of the total US funding is focused on risk research and approximately 1% addresses ethical, legal, and social issues. The Wilson Center study also found that funding in other countries is rapidly increasing. In 2014 the United Kingdom and the European Commission investments in synthetic biology exceeded nondefense spending in the United States (Wilson Center, 2015). In summary, synthetic biology is a promissory field of research and an emerging technology in need of governance.\n",

So what remains of the former Soviet arsenal and where are all of the seed stocks from the bioengineering efforts of Project Bonfire and the Hunter Program? Have deadly superbugs been sequestered for dark days ahead? Furthermore, what other countries have had and remain actively engaged in bioweapons production and research? The Office of the Secretary of Defense identified countries that maintain various levels of offensive biological warfare capabilities or research facilities. China, Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Taiwan are believed to have produced operational quantities of biological weapons (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1993). The Henry L. Stimson Center also identified Egypt, Israel, and Taiwan as countries of proliferation concern (Block, 1999).

The threat is now asymmetric, and as such, biological weapons will always be an option. Belligerents, allured by the potentially deadly power of weapons of mass destruction, strive to acquire them (Ainscough, 2002). However, when biological weapons have been used in battle, they have proven relatively ineffective. They have been undependable and uncontrollable (Zilinskas, 2000). Because they have been difficult to reliably deploy, their military value has been marginal. Stabilizing biological agents and deploying them, either overtly with sophisticated weaponry or covertly without endangering the perpetrator or friendly forces, requires expertise not widely held (Ainscough, 2002). It is possible that that this may change with the capabilities of biological engineering and a new generation of weapons.Critical Thinking: Possible Future Bioweapons Scenarios\nDr. Jim Davis (2002) stated that the three most likely bioweapons scenarios that the United States and its allies might face in the future are the following:\u2022An agroterrorist event against the United States,\u2022A bioweapons attack on US and allied troops in the Middle East, and\u2022A bioterrorist attack against a large population center in the United States or an allied state.\nOn the basis of what you know now and the current world situation, are these three possibilities still valid?

Terrorist groups with relatively few resources and a lot of \u201cwant to\u201d could manage to pull together a bioweapons attack. In addition, a small group with connections may be able to procure a small amount of formulated material, which may be enough to introduce a disease with a high degree of person-to-person transmissibility.\nMyth 4. Biological warfare must be too difficult because, when it has been tried, it has failed. Counter: There are certainly those that would argue Aum Shinrikyo\u2019s blunder with anthrax is an indication that well-funded terrorism is no guarantee for success. On many fronts, evildoing is not easy. However, that is no guarantee that subsequent attempts would not be successful. It only takes one successful attempt to make the point that it is easier to prepare for bioterrorism than to explain the lack of preparation after an attack.\nMyth 5. There are moral restraints that have and will keep bioweapons agents from being used. Counter: If a terrorist can fly a jumbo jet into a high-rise office building filled with thousands of innocent people, there really are no moral boundaries when it comes to terrorism.\nMyth 6. The long incubation period required for bioweapons agents before onset of symptoms makes bioweapons useless to users. Counter: Do not make the mistake of questioning the motives or means of a terrorist. A long incubation period may work to someone\u2019s advantage, especially if the act is covert and the perpetrator is looking to disseminate the agent along a broad front or from numerous points of release to make containment more difficult.\n",

Hospital leaders should examine current policies in relation to this threat and develop new policies as appropriate. Infection control practices are but one critical component of such planning efforts (Inglesby et al., 2000). As previously discussed in chapters Recognize, Avoid, Isolate, and Notify and Response at the State and Local Level, response organizations and community officials have increased their awareness to this threat, but it remains one of the least understood.

Multiplex diagnostics possessing broad-spectrum activity rapidly differentiate various common and lesser-known pathogens in a single clinical sample, identify drug sensitivities, and determine how a sample pathogen is related to known pathogens. Consider the lab-on-a-chip concept, in which a clinical specimen is placed on a microchip-like device, which has a complex microarray of DNA- or ribonucleic acid (RNA)\u2013based diagnostics. The chip allows the processing unit to test for dozens of possibilities simultaneously based on DNA- or RNA-hybridization modalities. Some exciting new developments along these lines have already occurred. Vaccines demonstrating broad-spectrum activity include cross-protective and multiple-component vaccines. Cross-protective vaccines induce an immune response against constant components of a microbe; therefore they are effective against pathogens that naturally or deliberately evolve or \u201cdrift\u201d. A universal influenza vaccine is an example of a cross-protective vaccine. Multiple-component vaccines include, within a single vaccine, elements that protect against viruses or microbes that are different but usually closely related. An example of a multiple-component vaccine is a hemorrhagic fever vaccine that contains elements of Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses.",

This approach would allow a small number of drugs to replace dozens of pathogen-specific drugs. In addition, the strategies to overcome antibacterial resistance could extend the clinical utility of existing broad-spectrum anti-infectives and have immediate benefits. Treatments that target host immune responses have the potential to be effective against multiple diseases.

Fortunately, the same advances in genomic biotechnologies that can be used to create bioweapons can also be used to set up countermeasures against them. The probability of a terrorist use of a genetically engineered biological agent on a given city is very low, but the consequence of such an event would obviously be very high. With maximum casualties the likely goals, metropolitan areas are most at risk for an attack. However, the indiscriminate nature of biological warfare and bioterrorism puts all communities at risk. This dilemma is the challenge of local communities, which are sensitive to the need for preparedness but have finite resources. Community officials must have a plan and sufficient medical and public health resources accessible to sustain a response for up to 24 h.

This process occurs frequently in nature. Many pathogenic bacteria contain multiple plasmids (small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA fragments) that code for virulence or other special functions. Virulent plasmids can be transferred among different kinds of bacteria and often across species barriers (Block, 1999).\u2022\nDesigner diseases. The possibility that science one day might allow a researcher to propose the symptoms of a hypothetical disease and then design or create the pathogen to produce the desired disease complex. Designer diseases may work by turning off the immune system; by inducing specific cells to multiply and divide rapidly (similar to cancer); or possibly by causing the opposite effect, such as initiating programmed cell death (apoptosis). This futuristic biotechnology would clearly indicate an order of magnitude of advancement in offensive biological warfare or terrorism capability (Block, 1999).\u2022\nDesigner genes. The entire genomes of numerous organisms have been published in unclassified journals and on the Internet. Now that the codes are known, it seems only a matter of time until microbiologists develop synthetic genes, synthetic viruses, or even complete new organisms. Some of these could be specifically produced for biological warfare or terrorism purposes (Block, 1999).\u2022\nGene therapy. Gene therapy will revolutionize the treatment of human genetic diseases. The goal is to effect a permanent change in the genetic composition of a person by repairing or replacing a faulty gene. The same technology could be subverted to insert pathogenic genes in a targeted host of population (Block, 1999).\u2022\nHost-swapping diseases. Viruses that \u201cjump species\u201d may occasionally cause significant disease. Manageable infectious agents can be transformed naturally into organisms with markedly increased virulence (Block, 1999).\u2022\nStealth viruses. The concept of a stealth virus is a cryptic viral infection that covertly enters human cells (genomes) then remains dormant for an extended time. However, a signal by an external stimulus could later trigger the virus to activate and cause disease. In fact, this mechanism occurs fairly commonly in nature. For example, many humans carry herpes virus, which can activate to cause oral or genital lesions. Similarly, varicella virus sometimes reactivates in the form of herpes zoster (shingles) in some people who had chickenpox earlier in life. However, the vast majority of viruses do not cause disease (Block, 1999).\u2022\nSynthetic biology. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology combining disciplines such as biotechnology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, systems biology, biophysics, computer engineering, and genetic engineering.\n",
