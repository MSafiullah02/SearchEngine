Since then, nonpathogenic Cedar virus has also been included into Henipavirus\n71. More recently, many newly discovered African henipaviruses and a pathogenic henipavirus from the Philippines have been reported, all of which have not been isolated or fully characterized 14, 27. Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are enveloped, pleomorphic virions with diameters averaging about 500 nm, but may range from about 40 to 1900 nm in length 38, 55. Each virion contains a tangle of nucleocapsids with a herringbone structure typical of paramyxoviruses. As negative\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA viruses, they have unusually large genomes of more than 18 000 nucleotides, comprising six genes encoding for the nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, fusion glycoprotein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G) and the large polymerase (Figure 1).The viral G protein attaches to the host cell ephrin B2 and/or B3 receptor, and activates the F protein to initiate viral envelop and host membrane fusion and viral entry 4, 82, 91.",

Viral RNAs of African henipaviruses have been detected in various species of non\u2010pteropid bats, including Eidolon helvum\n27.

Most likely urine and oronasal secretions from infected animals were responsible for passing the infection to humans through direct or possibly airborne exposure 75, 92, 109. In the NiV outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore, the pig was the main intermediate host, and pig farmers, abattoir workers, pork sellers and army personnel involved with culling of pigs had the highest prevalence of infection 2, 13, 88, 95, 106. Bat\u2010to\u2010pig transmission could have resulted from pigs consuming half\u2010eaten, contaminated fruits dropped by bats 20. Other domestic animals such as dogs, cows and goats may have the potential to act as intermediate hosts for NiV 18, 76, 133. Human HeV outbreaks were closely associated with infection in horses and indeed occurred mainly among veterinarians, stable workers and other personnel in close contact with horses. Though rare, the HeV\u2010infected dog may also have the potential to be an intermediate host 97. Bat\u2010to\u2010horse transmission remains unclear but is likely to be due to environmental contamination from bat urine or other bat\u2010derived materials 31, 127. Interestingly, in the henipavirus outbreak in the Philippines, the majority of patients were involved with slaughtering infected horses and/or consuming under\u2010cooked horse meat 14.",

Although human\u2010to\u2010human transmission may well have occurred in the Malaysia/Singapore outbreaks, the only well\u2010documented case was in a nurse who seroconverted but remained asymptomatic despite brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that showed a few typical lesions of acute encephalitis 115, 117. In other health staff involved with patient care, serum neutralization tests were found to be negative, possibly because of good clinical prophylactic measures 78. In the Philippines' henipavirus outbreak, the clinical and epidemiological evidence also suggested human\u2010to\u2010human transmission 14. To date, bat\u2010to\u2010human or human\u2010to\u2010human HeV transmission has not been reported 69.

Clinical signs such as areflexia/hyporeflexia with hypotonia, pinpoint pupils with variable reactivity, tachycardia, hypertension and abnormal doll's eye reflex were more frequently seen in patients with reduced level of consciousness. Segmental myoclonus characterized by focal, rhythmic jerking of the diaphragm and muscles in the limbs, neck and face was present in 30% of patients, and may be unique to acute NiV encephalitis. Other clinical features (eg, meningism, generalized tonic\u2013clonic convulsions, nystagmus and cerebellar signs) were also observed. Similar findings were also found in patient cohorts from Bangladesh and Singapore 53, 61. In Bangladesh, altered mental status and/or unconsciousness was reported in >70%, severe weakness in 67% and areflexia/hyporeflexia in 65% of cases, consistent with a high prevalence of acute encephalitis.

Some patients were reported to have neurological deficits, neuropsychiatric sequelae and gait/movement disorders 83, 108. Fatal intracerebral hemorrhage is a very rare complication 37.

So far, there has been only 1 case of relapsing HeV encephalitis and >20 cases of relapsing NiV encephalitis (possibly involving <10% of survivors), one of which occurred 11 years after an asymptomatic infection 1.

An interesting but rare finding was neuronal syncytia formation in the hamster and chicken embryo CNS 118, 133.

So far, there has been no direct evidence for this in human infection 136. Despite NiV strains from Bangladesh and Malaysia sharing about 91.8% genomic sequence homology 48, the infectious disease pathology may still differ. To address this question, two separate studies using the hamster model were performed. In one study, the Malaysian strain caused a more accelerated infection 24, but in another study there were no apparent significant differences 3. A study in ferrets also showed no pathological differences except for higher viral titers in oral secretions following infection with the Malaysian strain 22. Further studies by manipulating NiV genome using a recently described infectious clone may be helpful to further understand the differences, if any, between Bangladesh and Malaysian strains 142. The only study so far that directly compared HeV and NiV infections in an animal model (hamster) did not appear to demonstrate significant differences in the two viruses either, except for the finding that NiV initially replicated in the upper respiratory tract epithelium, whereas early HeV replication was in lung interstitium 105.",

Various approaches being pursued as part of ongoing research have been reviewed 8. During the NiV outbreak in Malaysia, ribavirin (a broad spectrum antiviral drug) was given empirically, and subsequently thought to be useful for patients 15. However, its effect on human HeV infections, if any, was uncertain 69. Nonetheless, as it was found to have some effect on henipaviruses experimentally 36, 139, ribavirin was further tested for its anti\u2010henipavirus properties either alone or in combination with a potentially useful antimalarial drug called chloroquine 94. Unfortunately, in the hamster, ferret and African green monkey models, ribavirin or ribavirin/chloroquine combinations were found to be ineffective against infection and disease 32, 86, 104. Other drugs have been suggested as having possible anti\u2010henipavirus effects 69.",

In fact, on humanitarian grounds, two patients with HeV infection have been given these antibodies with no adverse effects but the antiviral effectiveness has not been verified 9. Many new vaccine candidates for active immunization using different live recombinant vaccine, subunit vaccine and virus\u2010like particle platforms that mainly express henipavirus F and/or G proteins have been successfully developed and tested in various animal models including hamsters, pigs, cats, ferrets and African green monkeys models 6, 40, 60, 66, 77, 79, 87, 93, 96, 121, 125, 141.

Because of the worldwide distribution and their flying range that can cover huge areas of human habitat in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Oceania, Indian subcontinent, Australia and Africa, pteropid bats, in particular, are highly effective in virus dissemination 20, 29, 45, 46, 50, 54, 62, 64, 84, 102, 120. Hence, future henipavirus outbreaks in new areas/countries are probably inevitable as shown by the recent outbreak in the Philippines 14. A group of Africans who were involved with butchering bats for bush meat was recently found to be seropositive, thus providing evidence of previously unknown henipavirus spillover events in a continent that has yet to witness a henipavirus outbreak 90. The concept of One Health that integrates activities and contributions of international scientists, ecologists, veterinarians, health professionals, politicians and other stakeholders may be needed to minimize future outbreaks of bat\u2010borne zoonoses 112.",
