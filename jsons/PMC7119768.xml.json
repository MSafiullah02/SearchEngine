Capsid protein and the genome together form the nucleocapsid. E1 and E2 viral glycoproteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer to form the envelope. The E3 glycoprotein is not incorporated in the virion and is released as a cleavage product (Strauss and Strauss, 1994).",

Apart from field isolations, experimental infection of different species of Aedes of varying geographical locations with RRV was performed. Experimental infection of Ae. aegypti from Queensland (Kay et al., 1979), Jakarta (Gubler, 1981) demonstrated their transmission potential for RRV. Subsequent study from Fiji in Ae. aegypti resulted in transmission rates ranging from 52 to 85% (Mitchell and Gubler, 1987). These early experiments demonstrated susceptibility and transmissibility of RRV in different Aedes species.",

            "text": "The detection of RRV from field collected mosquitoes can be achieved through various assays like virus isolation, immunological and molecular tests. Viral isolation is the gold standard technique, however it is time consuming, requires cell culture facility and technical expertise. Serological test can be done through antigen capture ELISA but suffers from issue of sensitivity to detect low viral titre associated with mosquito samples. In contrast, PCR based molecular assay provide faster results, sensitive in detecting low titre samples and also do not require containment facility. The real time quantitative RT-PCR is more advantageous, as quantitation can be simultaneously achieved. Further these techniques provide higher sensitivity and simplicity in terms of sample processing compared to conventional RT-PCR. This technique is now widely used for mosquito surveillance and to study virus vector interactions (Dash et al., 2012, Agarwal et al., 2013). Compared to another real time PCR assay based on Taqman probe, SYBR Green chemistry provide advantages in terms of cost, ease of performance and applicability for highly mutating RNA viruses. Low cost of this assay due to use of only desalted primers (expensive probes are not required) makes it economical for testing large number of samples. More importantly, this assay is insensitive to nucleotide variations that could occur within the probe target region, resulting in lower false-negative results (Papin et al., 2004).",

Currently, no licensed antiviral drug or vaccine for RRV is available. Only symptomatic treatment including anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory and corticosteroids are prescribed to patients to ameliorate the disease (Mylonas et al., 2004). Development of antiviral remains one of the most important challenging areas in the management of viral infections. Classically, evaluation of antiviral compounds is performed employing plaque reduction assay. However, this technique is time consuming, labour intensive, making it restricted to advanced laboratories (Wei et al., 2013). Subsequently, other assays including immunofluorescence and antigen ELISA have also been utilized for antiviral screening. However, these techniques are not very sensitive, labour intensive and also requires specific antibody. The higher level of sensitivity and specificity achieved in PCR based molecular assays provides a convenient alternative for rapid screening of antivirals.",

Replication kinetics of RRV in Indian Ae. aegypti was measured by infection, dissemination and transmission at different days of post infection. Infection rate was determined as the percentage of all mosquitoes tested with infected midgut, which was found to be 100% at all the analyzed time points. Dissemination rate was determined as the percentage of mosquitoes with infected midgut that also had infected legs and wings, which was also found 100% at all the analyzed time points. The transmission rate was determined as the percentage of mosquitoes with positive dissemination that also had infected saliva. The transmission rate was found to reach up to 87.5% on 10 dpi. At 14 dpi, 75% transmission rate was achieved, which was higher compared to CHIKV as reported previously (Agarwal et al., 2013). This high level of transmission rate clearly indicates very high vectorial competence of Indian Ae. aegypti. Transmission analysis revealed presence of RNA in mosquito saliva on 3 dpi indicating a short extrinsic incubation period. A short extrinsic incubation period is of very high significance in terms of faster virus transmission and may lead to major outbreak. Also, the assay was efficient to detect virus among mosquitoes of different pool sizes, demonstrating its utility during vector surveillance.",

Ae. aegypti is the most dominant Aedes species widely distributed in all parts of India. The recent establishment of WNV, CHIKV and ZIKV in new territories substantiate the real threat associated with arboviruses. These risks associated with vector borne diseases inspired us to develop a sensitive technique for detecting RRV in mosquitoes. Since specific antiviral drug or vaccine against RRV is not yet available, early detection in mosquitoes can be a potential indicator of circulation of virus in nature and will assist to initiate prompt control measures. This preliminary study provides information on the vector competence of Indian Ae. aegypti for RRV.",

Maximum non-toxic dose of chloroquine was found to be 25 \u03bcM in Vero cells. Previous studies on Chikungunya virus have demonstrated 5\u201320 \u03bcM as the effective concentration of chloroquine (Khan et al., 2010). However in this study, only marginal protection was observed with chloroquine against RRV. Different inhibitory mechanisms of chloroquine involves prevention of viral endocytosis (Khan et al., 2010), decrease in concentration of cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 that are associated with disease severity and decrease in systemic levels of a liver enzyme (Aspartate aminotransferase) (Farias et al., 2015). In contrast, ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), thus depleting intracellular GTP pool (Takhampunya et al., 2006). It is a broad spectrum antiviral agent that acts as a RNA virus mutagen, causing lethal mutations in RNA virus genome (Crotty et al., 2002). Earlier studies employing Vero cells have shown effective dose of 30\u2013250 \u03bcM for orthopoxviruses (Smee et al., 2001), which is in agreement with this study. Ribavirin was found to provide effective protection up to 48 hpi. Further in vivo studies need to be carried out to evaluate the antiviral potential of Ribavirin against RRV.",
