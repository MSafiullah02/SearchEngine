Empathy is a complex, multidimensional, and dynamic concept, so in scientific literature the conceptualization of empathy has been stated by different words: emotional, moral, cognitive, behavioral, and clinical empathy [3]. Clinical empathy is defined as compassionate professionalism and the ability to understand the patient\u2019s situation, perspective, feelings, and actions in a helping or therapeutic way [4]. Clinical empathy has emotional, metacognitive, contextual, and interpersonal dimensions and its measurement is not easy [3].",

            "text": "In oncology wards, development of the nurse-patient empathic communication is very important for patients because it relieves mental stress [5], reduces anxiety, gives pain control, and increases emotional compatibility and hope [6]. Clinical empathy has many benefits such as increased patient satisfaction, better adherence to treatments, help to more accurate diagnosis, reduction of distress and illness symptoms as well as the improvement of quality of life in patients [7, 8]. The results of studies indicate that empathy maximizes patient care management, reduces the financial needs of the health care system, shortens the treatment period, and reduces the need for resources [9, 10]. The results of a qualitative study in Pakistan showed that cancer patients need an empathic nurse. Empathic nurses sense the vulnerability of the patients and respond accordingly; however, some patients are dissatisfied with their communication with nurses and suffer from anxiety [11]. Although there is a positive relationship between empathy, patient outcomes, and the clinical competency of healthcare personnel, there is still ambiguity about the influence of empathy on nurses [12]. In general, empathy as a laborious emotional effort requires energy, resources, and an appropriate environment for achieving the best results. Emotional distress, high workload, being responsible for very ill and dying patients, and having no time for self-care can lead to compassion fatigue. These multiple stresses in healthcare personnel may lead to insomnia, marital conflicts, substance abuse, and job attrition [13]. On the other hand, factors such as being very self-critical, having conflicting feelings regarding work, and being young and inexperienced can increase compassion fatigue and burnout in nurses, following empathy with patients.",

Eight of ten articles in a systematic review study revealed a negative relationship between empathy and burnout. One article supported the positive relationship between empathy and burnout. One study showed inconsistent evidence, with positive and negative correlations between different subscales of empathy and burnout [15]. Other research results showed that high and low levels of \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d are associated with high degrees of depression in individuals, but moderate empathy creates the highest protection against depression [16]. These controversial results can be due to quantitative research results, since they cannot adequately reveal the concept of empathy and its relationships with other phenomenon [17].",

To analyze the qualitative data, the Graneheim and Lundman content analysis method was used [21]. This method includes the following steps: transcribing of the entire interview immediately after each interview, reading the entire text to achieve a general understanding of its content, identifying the meaning units and extracting primary codes, classifying similar codes in comprehensive subcategories and categories (manifest content), and then determining the themes (the latent content). In this way, first meaning units were identified in sentences or paragraphs in the context of the interviews, and then they were condensed. The condensed meaning units were abstracted and labeled as primary codes. In primary coding, the text of each interview was read several times, and its original sentences were extracted and recorded. Next, the related codes were extracted and placed in a subcategory based on similarity. Afterwards, similar subcategories were placed in one main category, and ultimately themes were determined [21].",

They stated feelings of tranquility and psychological satisfaction in the subcategory of benefit of empathy for the nurse. Dal Santo and his colleagues tried to answer the main question in their research \u201cdoes the emotional interaction with the patient have positive consequences for nurses?\u201d Their research showed that empathy consists of two components: the cognitive (perspective taking) and the emotional (compassion). However, the cognitive component increases job satisfaction, work engagement and reduces job quitting, the emotional component does not [22]. The compassionate and empathic performance of nurses with patients is linked to positive and negative effects. Experience of positive emotions by nurses is described with satisfaction of compassion. Whereas, negative emotions may bring burnout and compassion fatigue [23]. These findings show the different effects of the patients\u2019 perspective taking and compassion on nurses\u2019 well-being [22]. Other research findings in the Malopolska Province of Poland, with 256 physicians and 410 nurses with different specialties, showed that with increasing empathy, the professional burnout of the healthcare team members decreased [24]. A qualitative study showed that nurses\u2019 empathy with patients has been studied more in oncology wards and intensive care units (ICUs), than in the other wards of the hospital. Empathy with patients in these areas can be a reason to enhance the motivation of nurses to continue their work in these wards [25]. Hojat concluded that empathic interactions lead to an understanding of experience, concern, and other people\u2019s perspective [2]. Another study suggests that empathy leads to more useful and accurate patient information, a better interpretation of patient complaints, a more specific diagnosis, better management of patient\u2019s problems, and more successful treatment [8].",

In addition, empathic interactions lead to positive effects in the patient, including greater satisfaction and better adaptation to the disease [2]. The results of a study on empathy in the field of oncology showed interesting results. There was a significant relationship between oncology nurses\u2019 empathy and cellular immunity in lung cancer patients. By developing nurses\u2019 empathy, the percentage of patient\u2019s B cell (B lymphocytes) and NK cell (natural killer cells) increased [27]. Many cancer patients suffer from a variety of negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and psychological discomfort [28, 29]. These negative emotions are activated by the axis of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and the autonomic nervous system, which in turn leads to release a large amount of adrenal glucocorticoid and catecholamines in the blood stream. These substances reduce the immune system [30]. Nurses\u2019 empathy positively affects the patients\u2019 immune system by influencing their psychological dimension [27].",

Exhaustion, fatigue, discomfort and nervousness, imagination of the disease in themselves and the family, anxiety, and burnout were stated by the participants. Earlier studies indicate evidence of high levels of stress among nurses in oncology settings [31]. Nurses who are working in oncology wards experience high levels of stress, compassionate fatigue, and burnout. Research findings in Australia indicated that more than 70% of oncology nurses experienced moderate to severe stress. Burnout was a result of nurses\u2019 physical and mental fatigue and particularly observed in wards where the emotional involvement of nurses with patients was higher [32]. Contrary to these results, in a study conducted in Spain, a significant relationship was found between high level of empathy and low level of burnout between nurses [33]. However, the results of a systematic review showed that the relationship between empathy and burnout is very complicated. It seems that the ability to self-regulate emotions during empathic communications reduces the risk of burnout [23].",

In a qualitative study, factors including job strain, task-centeredness, no formal training, poor manager support, and nurse-patient gender imbalance were mentioned by oncology nurses as barriers to empathy [34]. The results of a quantitative research showed that organizational factors such as staffing and resource adequacy, management ability, leadership, and support of nurses have a negative relationship with compassionate fatigue, after controlling for the demographic characteristics of nurses (gender, social status, ward type, work shift, type of employment, illness, years of experience in the current situation) [35].

These characteristics were apparent in subcategories of human beings, care through physical contact, communication, laughter and joke in care, and a sense of two-way interaction. The caregivers\u2019 personal characteristics, like kindness, understanding, and courage, give patients hope and strength as well as increase self-esteem and build trust in the caregiver [43]. Patience is another personal characteristics that was extracted from narratives of patients about necessary caregivers\u2019 characteristics [43].",

Therefore, it can be argued that the empathic communication is a process that is influenced by the cultural background of the healthcare provider and the patient [44]. In addition, social understanding and individuals\u2019 behavior are influenced by their awareness of the cultural environment [45]. The result of a study by Taheri et al. showed that cultural variables are important factors in the quality and quantity of empathy with the patient [46]. Nevertheless, oncology nurses in our study referred to the specific characteristics of the oncology wards and claimed that the specific atmosphere of the oncology wards, including the long-term hospitalization of cancer patients, would make nurses more empathic. Although the comparison of nurses\u2019 empathy based on type of the hospital ward is not easy, the results of a quantitative study showed that nurses working in oncology wards showed higher empathy in comparison with nurses in other wards [18].",

These findings can be used as a guide for nurse managers, planners, and nursing care providers in oncology settings to strengthen facilitators of clinical empathy and reduction of empathy inhibitors. Clinical empathy with cancer patients can be developed by applying strategies, such as the employing of experienced nurses in oncology wards rather than novice ones, managing the healthcare organization to meet standards, for example employing a sufficient number of qualified oncology nurses, introducing empathy as one of the most important competencies for oncology nurses, and holding workshops and training courses.",

Thus, clinical empathy with cancer patients can be developed by oncology nurses through special strategies, such as employing of experienced qualified nurses in oncology wards rather than novice nurses, and managing the healthcare organization to meet the standards.

Furthermore, welcoming the experience of oncology nurses\u2019 empathy with their patients by the healthcare organization and giving support increase the motivation for empathetic communication and improve patients\u2019 quality of life and their satisfaction.",
