The focus of the present document is, therefore, to provide guidance around safely resuming cardiac surgery, research and education in the above context.",

            "text": "The recommendations presented in this article were developed by committee discussions within a cardiovascular research consortium, based in 19 countries and representing a broad international spectrum of cardiac surgery experience with COVID-19. We aimed to provide a framework for restarting cardiac surgery in the outpatient and inpatient settings, in accordance with the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the risks posed by interrupted cardiovascular care, and the available recommendations from major societies. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Our practical recommendations, summarized in Tables 1 and 2 , are intended to support local decision-making according to governmental requirements, regional disease prevalence, institutional capacity, and ethics. The incremental mortality associated with suspending all elective cardiac surgery within a wide geographic region for 6-8 weeks may be estimated from studies of healthcare systems where surgery is routinely deferred for many weeks because of lack of capacity. For example, in 5,864 patients waiting for elective or urgent coronary bypass surgery in Sweden the risk of death increased by 11% per month. 13 A New Zealand study demonstrated significant incremental operative mortality in the nearly 20% of patients readmitted with acute coronary syndromes while waiting for bypass surgery. 14 A coordinated approach with cardiology services including invasive cardiology is essential, since these are an integral part of the cardiovascular patient evaluation and management. Supporting References: (13) (14) 2. Triggers and contingency plans for modifying cardiac service line activity in response to government regulations, hospital capacity, and disease burden should be agreed upon and clearly communicated with clinicians to minimize adverse events due to abrupt changes in clinical practice.

            "text": "cardiac surgery patients should be screened pre-operatively for COVID-19, and strong consideration be given to deferring care or using other care modalities for patients that test positive. (Level of Evidence: C)All cardiac surgery patients should be tested 48 hours pre-operatively for COVID-19, until the prevalence of asymptomatic community spread is minimal. Anecdotal reports indicate that COVID-19 infection in the perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, so cardiac surgery should be deferred where possible until the patient tests negative. In a patient with active COVID-19 infection who cannot safely be deferred, percutaneous and transcatheter therapies may be the safer option. Lung and heart transplant donors and recipients should be screened, and no transplants performed in positive patients. An important additional rationale for screening cardiac surgery patients for SARS-CoV-2 is the risk posed to healthcare workers during intubation, extubation, disconnection of the ventilator and bronchoscopy from aerosolization.8 Supporting References: (5,8) 2. Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care should be structured so that cardiac surgical patients with CoV-SARS-2 may be regrouped at one dedicated area within the unit, and infection risks to other patients and healthcare workers minimized. (Level of Evidence: C) It may not be feasible to cohort patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 is identified after cardiac surgery, or COVID patients on VA-ECMO on a separate COVID unit, because of the specialized nursing and intensivist care required perioperatively. Negative pressure bays within the Cardiac Surgery ICU should therefore be dedicated to care of cardiac surgery patients with CoV-SARS-2. Immunocompromized patients including transplant recipients should be cohorted in the ICU area most distant from this. Epidemiology and infection protocols should guide designation of clean and contaminated space in the COVID area (Figure 1): limitations on visitors, in-room rounding and care pathways should be redesigned to minimize traffic through the COVID area. Careful and frequent education of nursing, intensivist staff and consultant staff in use of PPE, virtual rounding and dedicated teams for high-risk procedures such as intubations will minimize the risk of cross-infection. Every effort should be made to cohort nursing, respiratory technicians, physiotherapists, imaging technicians and other staff to care of either COVID or non-COVID patients during a single shift. Specific protocols for postoperative emergencies (cardiac arrest) in COVID-19 positive patients who underwent cardiac surgery should be developed according to local resources, and may include restricting the indications for return to the operating room, and a dedicated emergency equipment cart to facilitate bedside emergency resternotomy, ECMO, chest tube or line placement Supporting References: (5, 6) 3. Surgical procedures on patients with SARS-CoV-2 should be minimized, and performed with strict adherence to protocols designed to mitigate risk posed to health-care workers (Level of Evidence: C) At the time of writing, over 19% of patients infected with SARS-CoV2 and 60 deaths in Italy alone were healthcare workers. Intubation and extubation, disconnection from the ventilator, bronchoscopy and tracheostomy expose the healthcare team to the greatest risk of vital transmission. This was recognized at relatively early stage in a joint position statement from the American Society of Anesthesiologists, that recommended full powered air-purifying respirators for induction and extubation of patients in endemicareas.8 There are noticeable disparities between PPE protocols between different centers in different regions and countries.8,[18][19][20] The American College of Surgeons recommends N95 respirators, particularly when operating on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.9 Thus, for individuals at highest risk of exposure at institutions that are unable to provide N95 masks to all members of the operating team, the American College of Surgeons recommends that all surgeons and other personnel who are not wearing N95s leave the operating room during intubation, extubation, and other necessary adjunct procedures that",

In the US many states and healthcare payers approved payment for clinical consultations and follow-up conducted by video (although not phone-only). Effective, early roll-out of secure, patient confidentiality-compliant video consultations will help mitigate the reluctance of patients with advanced cardiac morbidity to seek appropriate care, and allow closer follow-up of patients deferred for surgery. For post-operative patients, community primary care or cardiology practices may be willing to provide in-person visits where suture removal and incision checks can be performed. Hospital work-flow may also utilize remote working in the form of video rounds and conferences that facilitate team-based decision-making, education and administrative meetings while social distancing. Class IIa Recommendation 1. It is reasonable to revise resident rotations to address reduced operative experience, and support research programs halted or suspended during the pandemic response (Level of Evidence: C)",
