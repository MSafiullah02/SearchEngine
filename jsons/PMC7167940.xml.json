Much has been learned about this syndrome, including the epidemiology and transmissibility of SARS\u2010CoV infections and the clinical manifestations of disease 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Resurgence of SARS remains a distinct possibility in the post\u2010outbreak period 7. There is therefore an urgent need to establish a reliable animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV infection and for developing vaccines and antiviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of SARS.",

Replication of SARS\u2010CoV in the respiratory tract of mice has also been recently demonstrated 11. However, the long\u2010term sequelae of SARS\u2010CoV infection with respect to progression of the histopathological changes, the degree of immunological reaction, and the duration of virus replication in these animal models are largely unknown. Given the importance of developing a non\u2010human primate model for elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms of lung injury and developing new treatments for SARS, we investigated the susceptibility of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to SARS\u2010CoV infection through nasal cavity inoculation. The pathological changes in lungs and other organs after SARS\u2010CoV\u2010inoculation, the replication and excretion of SARS\u2010CoV in vivo, and the immune response specific for SARS\u2010CoV in all macaques were studied at different times after virus infection. In this paper, we report our findings on the molecular detection of SARS\u2010CoV replication in vivo, the timing of seroconversion and development of neutralizing antibody response, and the dynamic pathological changes in the lungs of infected animals over a 60\u2010day period.",

Before inoculation with SARS virus, the monkeys were examined according to the national microbiological and parasite SPF (specific pathogen\u2010free) standard and were verified free of anti\u2010SARS antibody. The experiments were performed in BL\u20103 level laboratories exclusively assigned for SCV research at the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science of CAMS, with an animal study protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee. The macaques were sacrificed according to the study design described in Table 1. This design was the result of a preliminary experiment with four rhesus monkeys sacrificed on the fourth, eighth, 12th, and 16th day post\u2010infection. This experiment showed that the lung lesions were much worse in two monkeys, ie 4 and 8 days after inoculation, and the inflammatory response still persisted on the 16th day post\u2010inoculation. On the basis of these data and the autopsy findings of human SARS patients, monkeys prepared for this experiment were examined on the fifth, tenth, 15th, 20th, 30th, and 60th day post\u2010infection, with the study design focusing on the behaviour of the acute inflammatory response after virus infection. In addition, the possibility of complications such as emphysema, proliferation of fibrous tissue, lung fibrosis, and pleural adhesion at the later stages (60 days) of infection were examined.",

Some respiratory ducts were packed with mucus and cell debris and, in addition, regeneration of the lining epithelium was seen simultaneously in certain terminal bronchioles (Figures 6A, a\u2013c and 6B, a, b). Desquamation of alveolar lining cells, lung oedema, and hyaline membranes in alveoli were identified in some infected animals (Figures 6C, a\u2013b; 7B, a, b; 7C, a, b; and 7D, a), however, the lung lesions were less intense compared with the pathological features seen in the lungs of patients who died of SARS 13, 14, 15. The severity of lung infection became mild in those animals that were sacrificed more than 30 days after the infection (Figures 8A, 9B, and 9C). In these animals, there was still infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in the inter\u2010alveolar septa (Figure 8A, a, b). Fragmentation of reticulin and elastic fibres of the alveolar wall was common (Figure 6D, a, b). There was also evidence of fibrous tissue proliferation and development of emphysema (Figures 8A and 9B).",

In this study, we detected sequential pathological changes in the lungs of macaques from 5\u201360 days post\u2010infection with SARS\u2010CoV. The pulmonary lesions are comparable to, though less intense than, those of SARS patients. Foci of interstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage were observed during the whole course of the experiment. Repeated haemorrhage, oedema, and over\u2010secretion of protein\u2010rich fluid inevitably resulted in fibrosis of pulmonary tissues. These pathological changes reflect the changes that are seen in the early stage of clinical SARS cases 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. An important observation in these studies is that there was no SARS\u2010related death in the infected animals and SARS infections in rhesus macaques were milder. The differences in clinical signs and symptoms, and pathological changes, in the experimentally infected rhesus macaques compared with human cases of SARS might be due, in part, to the presence of co\u2010infections or secondary infections in human cases 21, 22, whereas the monkeys used in this study were young and healthy. Secondly, treatment given to SARS patients might have had an impact on the histological changes. Thirdly, SARS\u2010CoV might have different cytopathic effects in humans and rhesus macaques.",

In particular, the lung lesions in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were infrequent and limited to focal interstitial alveolar inflammation and oedema and lesions reflecting severe damage to alveolar and bronchial cell damage were not observed. Our results differ from those of Rowe et al\n23, who showed limited disease, and those of Fouchier et al\n8 and Kuiken et al\n24, who showed in cynomolgus macaques a more severe pulmonary syndrome that resembled SARS in several ways. The reasons for these differences are not clear, but it should be noted that rhesus macaques of Chinese origin were used in our studies and viral RNA could be detected in all of the infected monkeys, the longest duration lasting to 16 days. In addition, virus could be isolated from five of eight infected monkeys and neutralizing antibody response persisted in the animals that were sacrificed at 60 days post\u2010infection. Thus, based on the results of virus detection, immunological response, and pathological changes in the lungs of infected animals, we conclude that the rhesus macaque model of SARS is valuable. Furthermore, a long\u2010term study that simultaneously examines the pathological changes and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles in the lungs from these animals might provide insight into the mechanism(s) of SARS\u2010CoV\u2010mediated lung injury and greatly facilitate the screening and evaluation of anti\u2010SARS drugs and vaccines.",
