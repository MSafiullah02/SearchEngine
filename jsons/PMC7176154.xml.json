In our first cohort of the initial 10 children admitted to the hospital [15], we found that the clinical course and radiological changes of children were generally much milder and the duration for resolution was also shorter. Most children (90%) have radiographic abnormalities on presentation to the hospital. The primary radiographic finding in paediatric patients with SARS was air-space opacification, which can be focal or multiple. Children of younger age usually present with focal segmental consolidation. A few teenage patients, who presented with a more severe disease and required oxygen therapy, had bilateral lung involvement and multi-focal consolidation [15] (Fig. 7). In general, the consolidative changes on chest radiography in children are less extensive than adults. The majority of children showed slight radiographic deterioration on serial chest radiographs with a mean peak on day 6 after the onset of fever. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion and cavitation are not features of paediatric SARS, in contrast to the more common paediatric chest infections such as tuberculosis [16] and pneumococcal pneumonia [17]. At the time of writing of this review, all the patients in our initial cohort have recovered with complete resolution of radiographic changes.",

Our preliminary observation (on a small series of patients) showed that about 60% (15 of 24 patients) of these patients had evidence of fibrosis (presence of parenchymal band, irregular surface and traction bronchiectasis) on follow-up HRCT after discharge [10] (Fig. 9). Patients with evidence of fibrosis at follow-up were older and had more severe disease during the period of treatment [higher intensive admission rate, more steroid dosage required, higher peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and more severe peak radiographic changes] than those without fibrosis. Although the HRCT at discharge does show evidence of residual disease and fibrotic changes, we believe it is too early to estimate the true extent of fibrosis. A follow-up HRCT at 6 months combined with clinical features (including lung function test) would be more accurate in reflecting lung damage and its implication on the patients' daily activities and exercise tolerance.",
