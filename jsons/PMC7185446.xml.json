            "text": "Thus, a weakening of the mucus gel barrier may be at the origin of disorders such as gastritis and colitis (Droy-Lefaix, 1987). Short-term treatment with clay minerals, such as smectites (Mor\u00e9 et al., 1987) and attapulgite (Mor\u00e9 et al., 1992) increases the thickness of the adherent mucus. This may be ascribed to interactions of mineral particles with mucus components (Leonard et al., 1994) by which the gastrointestinal glycoproteins are modified, and their polymerization is enhanced (Droy-Lefaix et al., 1986). Similarly, aluminium (hydr)oxides (e.g., boehmite) can reduce mucus degradation (Bouyssou et al., 1990). The beneficial effects of minerals are also associated with improvements in the rheological properties of the mucus gel, such as spinability. This reflects the increased extent of polymerization, and the improvement in quality, of the adherent mucus (Droy-Lefaix et al., 1985). Changes in the physico-chemical properties of the mucus, induced by the action of clay minerals, were confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results indicate that clay mineral ingestion decreases mucus solubility. At the same time, the viscosity and hydrophobicity of the mucus increases, enhancing its adhesion to epithelial cells.",

(1995), for example, showed that patients with ulcerative colitis show a six-fold greater mean total faecal proteinase activity (expressed in mmol terminal NH2/min/g dry weight of faeces) than the control. Smectite totally inhibits this enzyme activity. The effects of smectite on mucus proteolysis are assessed using a model of mucolytic activity, assayed by the release of degraded colonic mucin from the adherent mucus gel of freshly prepared pig colonic bags in vitro. Similarly, trypsin (2 mg/mL) releases three times more soluble mucin per bag than the control. Smectite (100 mg/mL) inhibits trypsin activity, causing the level of degraded mucin to fall below the normal value. This is ascribed to the interaction of smectite with the adherent mucus layer, and the binding of trypsin to the mineral (Samson et al., 1995).",

These deleterious effects are accompanied by a decrease in the gastric transmural potential difference which serves as a criterion of the functional integrity of the mucosa (Fioramonti et al., 1990). Erosion of the mucus layer leads to a significant alteration of rheological properties (Droy-Lefaix et al., 1992; Slitine-Bonet et al., 1994).
