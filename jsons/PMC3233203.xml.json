The order of the lung function at every annual visit was as follows: IOS, prebronchodilator, and postbronchodilator spirometry. The family was instructed to give the child the prescribed asthma medications but to hold albuterol and caffeinated food products for 6 hours prior to the annual visit. If the child was ill or taking albuterol for symptoms, the visit was rescheduled. Two puffs of albuterol via metered-dose inhaler and valved spacer were adminsitered 15 minutes prior to the spirometry. Criteria for preschool lung function published by Eigen et al,20 similar to those used in Childhood Asthma Research and Education Network studies,21, 22 were applied in this study (see Table E1 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). These are similar to those recently recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)7 (Table E1). Ten percent of the studies performed in each year were overread by a blinded reviewer for quality assurance purposes. Only those tests that met the modified Eigen/ATS criteria were included.",

Mixed-effect linear regression models of lung function from children obtained at ages 5 through 8 years (prebronchodilator spirometry) and ages 6 through 8 years (postbronchodilator spirometry) were used to assess associations between lung function measures and lung function and the history (occurrence, severity, and frequency) of viral wheezing illnesses, both overall and for individual ages, while accounting for the repeated outcome measurements over time. Longitudinal analyses were performed separately for each lung function parameter and adjusted for age, race, gender, height, weight, asthma, passive smoke exposure, age at the earliest positive FEIA (1-2 years, 3-6 years, no positive FEIA 1-6 years); analyses of percent-predicted values (based on age, race, gender, height, and weight) were adjusted for asthma, passive smoke exposure, and FEIA only. Associations between spirometric and demographic variables and successful completion of IOS at each age were assessed by using Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test.

At age 8 years, children with RV wheezing illnesses had significantly lower FEV1 (1.29 vs 1.42, P = .001), FEV1% (96 vs 102, P = .03), FEV0.5 (0.98 vs 1.10, P = .001), FEF25-75 (1.21 vs 1.51, P < .001), FEV1/FVC (0.82 vs 0.85, P = .009), and FEV0.5/FVC (0.62 vs 0.66, P = .02) compared with children without RV wheezing illnesses (see Table E5 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Similar findings were observed using a longitudinal model of lung function obtained from children at ages 5 through 8 years.

An RV wheezing illness during the first 3 years of life was associated with lower pulmonary function, and notably, this relationship did not hold true for wheezing illnesses caused by RSV or other respiratory viruses. These relationships were less pronounced but were still significantly different after administration of bronchodilator and thus are not likely explained by increased airway tone alone. We previously reported that RV wheezing illnesses were strong predictors for asthma6; this study underscores and extends these findings by demonstrating that wheezing illnesses with RV and not with other viruses in the first few years are also associated with lower lung function. Children who experience early life viral wheezing episodes are a heterogeneous group with over half outgrowing their wheezing episodes by school age.2 It is possible that children who have RV-specific wheezing illnesses in early life may be at higher risk to develop asthma and lower lung function as they mature.",

This study provides additional novel evidence that early RV wheezing illnesses are also related to lower lung function in childhood. The causality of this association is unknown. RSV is a recognized lower airway pathogen and it has also been associated with an increased risk of asthma, the prevalence of which appears to dissipate during the first decade.5, 28, 29 Previous studies also have found a relationship between lower lung function and RSV wheezing illnesses,30, 31 but these respiratory infections were severe enough to require the child to be hospitalized. Given RSV\u2019s role as a lower airway pathogen, we anticipated that RSV illnesses would be more likely to be associated with reduced lung function. Therefore, we were intrigued to find that children who wheezed during early life with RV, as opposed to RSV, were those children who were significantly more likely to have lower lung function at school age. Along these lines, pathways by which RV infection could lead to airway remodeling have recently been identified.32, 33 Also, infants born with poor antiviral responses are more prone to repetitive illness. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that epithelial and/or mononuclear cell innate antiviral responses to infection with RV may be deficient in atopic asthmatic patients34, 35 This deficient immune response may lead to lower lung function after one RV infection. Our data did not show that children with repeated or more severe RV wheezing illnesses had lower lung function than those with less frequent or less severe RV wheezing illnesses. However, it is possible that our study lacked sufficient power to show these associations. Although we did not find evidence that RSV wheezing illnesses were associated with reduced lung function, few of our study participants had severe illnesses requiring hospitalization. It is possible that severe RSV illnesses could lead to significant reductions in lung function.",

            "text": "Unlike the study by Illi and colleagues,36 which demonstrated reduced lung function in children with early allergic sensitization and allergen exposure, we did not find that allergic sensitization lead to greater lung function deficits than RV wheezing illnesses alone. However, allergen exposure was not measured in our study. An alternate explanation is that children who wheeze with RV may have congenitally lower lung function, and so RV wheezing illnesses serve only as a marker of antecedent abnormal lung physiology. Children who have lower lung function shortly after birth are more likely to have lower lung function as they age compared with normal children, but not persistent asthma.2, 37 However, a study by Haland and colleagues demonstrated that children with lower lung function measured by tidal breathing flow-volume loops shortly after birth are more likely to have lower lung function at age 10 years38 and the diagnosis of asthma at 10 years of age.39 Another recent study by van der Zalm et al40 demonstrates that increased total lung resistance measured at 2 months of age is associated with subsequent RV wheeze; however, the low viral detection rate of other non-RV viruses made it impossible to study an association between neonatal lung function and infection with other types of viruses. We cannot confirm these findings in the COAST study because infant pulmonary function tests were not performed. However, our study does provide unique assessment of numerous respiratory viruses including RV and RSV and their association with childhood lung function. Furthermore, Haland and colleagues39 found that lung function at 10 years of age was not affected by a history of at least 1 or 3 or more lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first 2 years of life after adjusting for lung function measured at birth. However, this result may have been different if the etiology of the infection was analyzed as was done in this study.",

This association of early life RV wheezing illnesses and lower lung function was found by using 2 different methods of lung function measurements, spirometry and IOS, and the findings were consistent across multiple lung function parameters produced by each method. The association was best for the measures of FEV0.5 and FEF25-75 rather than FEV1. This is not an unexpected finding as young children often empty their lung volumes in less than 1 second7, 13 and FEV1 is often normal in children with asthma.41 Other studies have also shown that FEF25-75 rather than FEV1 is often the first lung function measurement that is decreased in children with asthma compared with controls.2, 13, 42 However, the children enrolled in COAST also are at high risk to develop asthma and allergies and mainly Caucasian, and so these findings may not be generalizable to all children.",

This finding, in combination with published data that wheezing with RV predicts future and persistent wheezing15, 43 and asthma,6 suggests that recognizing early life RV illnesses could be of prognostic significance. Additional studies confirming that infants experiencing recurrent RV wheezing illnesses have normal lung function at birth and examining mechanisms by which RV infection in early life may lead to lower lung function in later childhood and beyond are essential. Furthermore, once these disease mechanisms are understood, additional studies could explore novel interventions such as antiviral or immunosuppressant therapies to interrupt the progression from early childhood wheezing to asthma.Clinical implicationsThese findings suggest that recognizing early life rhinovirus illnesses could be of prognostic significance. Whether low lung function is a cause and/or effect of rhinovirus wheezing illnesses is yet to be determined.\n",
