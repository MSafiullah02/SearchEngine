            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), which belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, are the leading pathogen of Felidae around the world (Horzinek & Osterhaus, 1979 \u25b6). FCoVs have two antigenically distinct serotypes: type I and type II (Balint, Farsang, Szeredi et al., 2014 \u25b6). Both serotypes occur in two pathotypes: Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FECV mainly replicates in the lower portion of the intestinal tract, spreads by the faecal\u2013oral route, and presents clinically as mild or inapparent enteritis (Pedersen et al., 1981 \u25b6; Herrewegh et al., 1997 \u25b6; Balint, Farsang, Zadori et al., 2014 \u25b6). On the other hand, FIPV efficiently replicates in macrophages/monocytes, leading to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal systemic granulomatous disease of wild and domestic cats (Addie et al., 2009 \u25b6; Pedersen, 2009 \u25b6; Balint, Farsang, Szeredi et al., 2014 \u25b6; Balint, Farsang, Zadori et al., 2014 \u25b6; Kipar & Meli, 2014 \u25b6). FIP, as an immune-mediated disease, features the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon (Weiss & Scott, 1981 \u25b6; Vennema et al., 1990 \u25b6; Tirado & Yoon, 2003 \u25b6). The virus-specific antibodies induced upon infection by FIPV in cats do not protect them, but enhance the infection by FIPV and thus accelerate the disease symptoms (Weiss & Scott, 1981 \u25b6; Vennema et al., 1990 \u25b6; Tirado & Yoon, 2003 \u25b6; Takano et al., 2008 \u25b6). Hence, there has been little progress in the development of clinical vaccines against FIPV, although a variety of methods have been tried, such as avirulent vaccines, attenuated live FIPV vaccines and recombinant vaccines (Pedersen, 2009 \u25b6).",

            "text": "Like other coronaviruses, FIPV contains a single-stranded positive-sense polyadenylated RNA genome that encodes two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) which need to be processed into 16 non\u00adstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316) for genome replication (Dye & Siddell, 2005 \u25b6). This process is mediated by two virus-encoded proteinases. Nsp5, also named main protease (Mpro), is responsible for 11 out of 15 cleavage sites, thus playing a pivotal role in this digestion process and being indispensable for viral replication (Dye & Siddell, 2005 \u25b6). The critical role of nsp5 in virus replication makes it an ideal target for anti-FIPV drug design (Yang et al., 2005 \u25b6; Anand et al., 2003 \u25b6). To date, several crystal structures of other coronavirus main proteases have been solved (Anand et al., 2002 \u25b6, 2003 \u25b6; Yang et al., 2003 \u25b6, 2005 \u25b6; Hilgenfeld, 2014 \u25b6). Based on the structural analysis of these main proteases, the idea of designing wide-spectrum inhibitors against CoVs has been proposed. In this study, we report the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study of FIPV main protease in complex with a designed Michael acceptor inhibitor named N3 (Supplementary Fig. S11).",

Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml\u22121 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cultures were induced to express FIPV main protease at 289 K for 16 h.

The previously reported inhibitor N3 (Yang et al., 2005 \u25b6), dissolved in 100% DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mM as a stock, was added to the purified protein to give a molar ratio of between 3:1 and 5:1. After mixing at 4\u00b0C for 4 h, the protein complex was centrifuged at 12 000g for 10 min and exchanged into a buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT using Thermo iCON concentrators. The final protein was concentrated to 8 mg ml\u22121 for crystallization. In the initial stage, commercial screening kits, including Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen 2, PEG/Ion and Index (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, California, USA), were used to screen for preliminary crystallization conditions for FIPV main protease with the inhibitor N3. Crystallization trials were set up in 16-well crystallization plates at 291 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Crystallization drops were carefully set up by mixing 1.0 \u00b5l protein solution with 1.0 \u00b5l reservoir solution and were then left to equilibrate against 200 \u00b5l reservoir solution. Initial crystals of FIPV main protease in complex with N3 inhibitor were obtained after 24 h under condition No. 45 from Crystal Screen, which consists of 0.2 M zinc acetate dihydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate trihydrate pH 6.5, 18%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. The optimized condition consisted of 0.2 M zinc acetate dihydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate trihydrate pH 6.5, 14%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Fig. 1 \u25b6\nb). The crystallization information is summarized in Table 2 \u25b6.",

However, upon virus infection the induced antibodies further enhance the infection instead of neutralizing the virus. This is the so-called \u2018antibody-dependent enhancement\u2019 (Weiss & Scott, 1981 \u25b6; Vennema et al., 1990 \u25b6; Tirado & Yoon, 2003 \u25b6). Thus, no clinical vaccines against FIPV have been successfully developed to date. For this reason, the FIPV main protease, which is indispensable for virus replication, is an alternative target for antiviral therapy and has been subjected to crystallographic studies.",
