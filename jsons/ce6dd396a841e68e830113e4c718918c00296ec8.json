Here, an alternating current is passing through a resistant metal wire electrode, generating heat which is then applying to living tissue to achieve the hemostasis or varying degrees of tissue destruction (1) . Heating of tissues causes vaporisation of protein and fat which results surgical smoke(2) which contain particles from combustion and numerous chemicals like hydrocarbons, acrylonitrile, phenols and fatty acids and biological particles, viruses, and bacteria which are known to be potentially hazardous. Applications of high-frequency electrocautery in cutting and coagulation modes produce odorous smoke from tissue pyrolysis.

Now, a multiplicity of chemical and biological hazards have been identified in surgical smoke. It is reported that surgical smoke has mutagenic effects as well (6) . Surgical smoke contains contaminants such as hydrocarbons, acrylonitrile, phenols, fatty acids, nitriles and carbon monoxide and viable cellular elements (7, 8) . The main chemical in surgical smoke is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs). Amongst these PAHs, benzopyrene(BaP) is the most significant carcinogenic compound (9) . Benzopyrene is often used as an indicator of cancer risk for target populations. Studies have shown that higher cauterisation temperatures produce more harmful chemical components while lower temperatures produce more cell particles (5) . It is also found that different electrosurgical techniques produce different amounts of surgical smoke (10) . The chemical composition of surgical smoke also varies by the type of tissue dissected. Muscular tissue produces aldehyde and ketone; liver and fatty tissue liberates carbon monoxide and hydrocyanic acid; epidermal tissue produces xylene, toluene, and ethyl benzene(5).",

The cutting mode can create a higher tissue temperature in a shorter period of time, resulting in rapid expansion and explosive vaporisation of intracellular contents (17) . While coagulation is performed using waveforms with lower average power, heat generating is insufficient for explosive vaporisation. So the risk of surgical smoke production is more with cutting mode and will be absent or negligible with coagulation mode. Surgical smoke is a nuisance because it has a repulsive odour and can obstruct the surgeon's view of the surgical site. Individuals in the operating room, including surgeons, surgical technicians, nurses, anaesthesiologists, and others, are exposed to surgical smoke annually (18) .",

Although direct physical injury and carcinogenesis have been well demonstrated in in vitro and animal models, it is difficult to describe the long-term effects on humans due to the inherent time lag and the inability to prove causality (30) . Some of the risks are theoretical, until there is evidence that disproves these risks to humans. 4 . Deleterious Effects to Patients: Electrical shocks and burns are possible from electrocautery arise from a faulty grounding pad or from an outbreak of a fire (31) . This issue happens if the surface of the contact pad is small and the pad is disconnected from the radio frequency generator or through a metal implant (32) .Modern electrocautery systems have sensors that prevent similar injuries. There have also been reports of flash fires, especially in the case of increased oxygen concentrations of anesthetics (33) . The toxicity of surgical smoke may cause harm to patients.There have been no reports that surgical smoke exposure to patients can cause any obvious chronic diseases such as cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COLD). Such diseases might be caused by accumulation processes. Diathermy can also cause tissue damage through energy transfer to the implanted spinal cord stimulation system, resulting in serious injury or death. Diathermy incision has many advantages compared with the scalpel because of reduced incision time, less blood loss, and reduced early postoperative pain (34) , but there are reports which show increased tissue damage and a significant reduction in the tensile strength of healing wounds (35).",

The capability of 20 ACH can be able to remove hazardous substances below those of exposure standards (36) . It was described that conventional ventilation will work effectively if exhaust grills must be free of obstruction by equipment or furniture (37) . The use of specific suction or extraction measures for surgical smoke has been recommended by many regardless of exposure duration or concentration level (38, 39) . Smoke evacuation in the operating room has been highly recommended to minimise exposure(3). High efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) is another recommendation to reduce the hazards of surgical smoke. In HEPA contaminated air first passes through the operating room corner vents, and is then filtered and re-circulated in the operating room.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use smoke extraction devices. In view of surgical smoke has been shown to harbour intact virus particles, it can very well carry COVID-19 like viruses. So it is mandatory to minimise or avoided electrocautery especially in COVID-19 outbreak, as it was recommended in Middle East Respiratory syndrome outbreak(MERS) (42) . A negative-pressure operating room is the optimal environment to prevent all airborne viruses including COVID-19, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, gases, volatile organic compounds, small particles and chemicals spreading to adjacent areas (43) .",

This lack of evidence is compounded by a lack of research comparing electrosurgical techniques, type of surgery, and ACH. Future researches have to focus on surgical smoke exposure levels in operating room while performing a specific type of surgery, using a specific electrosurgical technique and the ability of air changes per hour(ACH) and other administrative measures to reduce surgical smoke exposure to acceptable levels (36) . Cold steel scalpel has been the instrument of choice for surgical incisions because of accuracy, and predictable tissue damage (50) . However, the use of cold steel scalpel must be accompanied by electrocautery to maintain hemostasis and a clear surgical field. Furthermore, research is needed on a equally or better alternative to electrocautery, which can can also reduce incision time, bleeding, and thermal tissue damage might be beneficial as well. The ACE Blade and Mega Power Generator (ACE electrosurgical system) is a next-generation electrosurgery system that is intended for use in a broad range of surgical procedures requiring the use of electrosurgery (50) .",
