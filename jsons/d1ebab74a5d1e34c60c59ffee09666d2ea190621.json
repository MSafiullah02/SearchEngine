In pandemic regions, healthcare systems are being shaped by the numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring urgent medical attention. 1 Hospitals are improvising and continuously revising protocols to maintain an efficient level of functioning amidst significant shortages in facilities and equipment. [2] [3] [4] Neurosurgical services, albeit not directly concerned with managing COVID-19 complications, are affected by the pandemic as well due to the precautionary need to preserve resources. Several departments have reported their experiences and responses to the COVID-19 crisis in an attempt to provide insights from which other impacted departments can benefit. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] We recently published our response, the 'Battle Plan', at the University of South Florida Department of Neurosurgery, 10 which has so far been successful in sustaining optimal management of patients with urgent/emergent neurosurgical conditions and a safe environment for all personnel involved in the care of these patients.",

The total number of cases dropped by more than half (214 versus 91 over a 4-week period), which was a direct consequence of the rigid stratification of possible nerusorugical interventions into specific categories of emergent, urgent and essential. Cases were stratified first by the neurosurgery service and then submitted for review to a multidisciplinary OR Governance Committee to assure proper selection and equitable distribution of OR time and space. Only emergent, urgent and essential cases were admitted and staffed, the majority of whom presented to the ED directly. Teleclinic patient screening by the Battle Plan Teams who are in social isolation was surprisingly efficient in identifying urgent and essential cases (11 patients in total: 10 requiring an intervention within 1 day and 1 requiring an intervention within 1 week). We predict that telemedicine will be heavily incorporated into neurosurgical practice after the pandemic ends, especially since most personnel at academic centers have attained experience in evaluating patients in the telemedicine format nearly as effectively as during in-person clinic visits. Several limitations still exist, especially those related to obtaining imaging studies performed at institutions/radiology centers outside of our hospital system and workflow related to incorporating residents, fellows, advanced practice providers (APPs) in the telemedicine visits for purposes of education and efficient clinical practice. Rapid and efficient cross-institutional \"sharing\" of imaging studies will be resolved in the era of high-speed internet, where remote access to these imaging studies can be granted to providers. 10 Workflow issues will require redefining the roles, duties, and job descriptions of the non-faculty providers. Only 17 of the 91 cases were classified as emergent, including strokes, ruptured aneurysms, hematoma evacuations, etc., whereas most of the cases (65/91) required an urgent intervention within 1 day, such as angiograms, unstable vertebral fractures, spinal cord compression and progressive myelopathy, brain lesions with mass effect and neurological deficits, shunt revisions, etc.",

Although less common than other subspecialties, adult open vascular cases more than doubled compared to regular practice (2.4% versus 6.6%) (Figure 1) ; these included carotid endarterectomies, resection of vascular malformations, and vascular bypass procedures. One would have expected that the numbers of adult spine cases would significantly decrease due to their mostly elective nature; however, only a small drop (2.9%) in the relative case load was evident in this subspecialty, with an uptick in unstable traumatic fractures at different vertebral levels constituting 11 of 21 adult spine cases and 2 of 2 pediatric spine cases (Figure 1) .",

The median operative time was 2.12 hours in 57 patients who underwent any type of open surgery (other than endovascular procedures), and the median length of hospital stay was 5 days in 77 patients who were discharged; 14 (15.4%) patients were still at the hospital by the time data collection was concluded. Most of the patients (50.6%) were discharged home, followed by the inpatient rehabilitation center (19.7%). The mortality rate was 7.7%. A total of 214 surgical cases (per 4 weeks; averaged from 6-month data) performed during regular practice were used as the control group. Comparison of the relative numbers/percentages of neurosurgical interventions by patient population (adult versus pediatric) and subspecialty (craniotomy/biopsy for brain tumor, trauma or pain; open vascular; endoscopic endonasal; functional and epilepsy; ventriculoperitoneal shunt; peripheral nerve; spine; and endovascular) between regular practice and practice after implementing the 'Battle Plan' 10 during the COVID-19 pandemic are reported in Figure 1. Endovascular and adult spine procedures were consistently the 1 st and 2 nd most common subspecialty procedures during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 epochs, whereas the adult functional/epilepsy (18.1%) and adult craniotomy/biopsy for brain tumor (11%) switched positions, with adult functional/epilepsy occupying 3 rd place during the COVID-19 epoch and adult craniotomy/biopsy for brain tumor occupying 3 rd place during the COVID-19 epoch.",
