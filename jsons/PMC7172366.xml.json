            "text": "Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) establishes persistence in a high rate of patients, resulting in more than 160 million chronic infections worldwide. In recent years, direct acting antivirals and host targeting antivirals have been identified, allowing new opportunities for antiviral therapy of patients chronically infected with HCV [1]. Characteristics of host targeting antivirals include their broad genotype coverage and their high barrier to resistance [1]. One such compound is the cyclophilin (Cyp)-inhibitor alisporivir, which targets the cellular protein and HCV host factor cyclophilin A (CypA), and has been in clinical development for HCV therapy [2], [3], [4]. Furthermore, due to involvement of cyclophilins in the lifecycle of a broad range of viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or several coronaviruses, alisporivir represents a promising candidate for pan-viral therapy [5]. The drug is an analog of the cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporine A (CsA), which blocks T cell activation by forming a ternary complex together with CypA and the phosphatase calcineurin [6]. In addition, CsA suppresses major histocompatibility complex-class I (MHC-I) dependent antigen presentation by a poorly defined mechanism [7]. The structure of alisporivir differs in two amino acid residues from the immunosuppressant CsA, abrogating the inhibitory effect on T cell activation [8]. However, its effect on antigen presentation has not been clarified so far.",

To generate a more physiological environment, we used hepatoma cell lines endogenously expressing HLA-A\u221702 and stably expressing an epitope-matched HCV-NS5B protein (NS5BEM; EM\n = epitope-matched) (Fig. 1\nA). NS5B-derived peptides are presented on the cellular surface via HLA-A\u221702, resulting in antigen-specific T cell activation during co-culture of HLA-A\u221702+ NS5BEM transduced hepatoma cells with NS5B-specific CD8+ T cells and concomitant production of various effector molecules (Fig. 1A). Importantly, this co-culture assay encompasses the whole antigen presentation process, from physiological regulation of MHC-I expression and processing of an endogenous antigen to surface presentation via MHC-I. Therefore, modifications at any step of this pathway significantly impacting on the efficiency of functional antigen presentation should be detectable as changes in CD8+ T cell activation.",

More than 90% of CD8+ T cells were activated upon co-culture with HepG2_NS5BEM cells, which could not be further enhanced by pretreatment of HepG2 cells with IFN-\u03b3, a well-known stimulant of MHC-I antigen presentation (Supplementary Fig. 1B) [15]. Therefore, HepG2 cells were not suitable for our model, since any condition enhancing antigen presentation would be missed. In contrast, Huh6.1_NS5BEM cells gave rise to a significant portion of activated CD8+ T cells, which was lower than for HepG2 (Fig. 1B), possibly due to lower MHC-I expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The basic CD8+ T cell activation rate in co-cultivation assays varied between 6% and 42% in different experiments (compare Figs. 1B, 2\nC, D), due to passage number and pre-activation status of CD8+ T cells. Still, modulatory effects of cytokines remained the same, independent from baseline activation levels (data not shown). Upon confirming cytokine receptor expression on Huh6 Con1 cells (Supplementary Table 1), the founder cell line of Huh6.1, we used several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-\u03b2 and IL-4) and type I, II and III interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03bb) to evaluate physiological regulation of antigen presentation in our system and to define its dynamical range. Pretreatment of Huh6.1 cells with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 led to an enhancement of CD8+ T cell activation, while IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2, as expected, did not have a stimulating effect (Fig. 1B). However, type I and II IFNs, well-known stimulants of antigen presentation [15] as well as a type III IFN and IL-27, which was reported to have IFN-\u03b3-like effects on hepatocytes [16] stimulated functional antigen presentation in Huh6.1 cells even stronger (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, alterations in HLA-A\u221702 surface expression of Huh6.1 target cells upon treatment with different cytokines correlated with changes in their antigen presentation potency (Fig. 1C).",

In striking contrast, alisporivir pretreatment of Huh6.1 target cells dose-dependently increased the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells, suggesting a stimulation of the antigen presentation capacity of Huh6.1 by alisporivir (Fig. 2C). We used 2 or 4 \u03bcM alisporivir in all subsequent experiments since this concentration range was regarded as physiologically relevant, based on its efficacy to inhibit HCV replication in vitro and in vivo\n[18], [19]. Next, Huh6.1 cells were pretreated for different times with alisporivir to explore the kinetics of immunostimulation. A 24 h pretreatment only had minor effects, whereas 48 h after treatment, the increase of CD8+ T cell activation reached a plateau and remained stable for at least 6 days (Fig. 2D), arguing for a slow and accumulating process increasing antigen presentation by alisporivir. The percentage of activated CD8+ T cells was enhanced by approximately 40% upon alisporivir treatment during all experiments (compare Fig. 2C, D).",

Assuming that the amount of MHC-I/peptide on the cell surface is a limiting factor of antigen-specific T cell activation, we measured surface HLA-A\u221702 on Huh6.1 cells after different times of alisporivir treatment (Fig. 3\nA, B). Indeed, alisporivir slowly and continuously enhanced HLA-A\u221702 and beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) surface expression over time (Fig. 3A, B). To assess whether this effect was restricted to Huh6.1 cells we analyzed further liver-derived cell lines (Fig. 3C). Since these cell lines, apart from HepG2, endogenously expressed HLA alleles differing from HLA-A\u221702 we measured their b2m surface expression, which was indeed significantly upregulated in Huh6.1, Huh7_Lunet, HepG2 and HepaRG after 48 h of alisporivir treatment compared to DMSO controls (Fig. 3C\u2013E). Analogous results were obtained with an MHC-I specific antibody (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). Furthermore, alisporivir treatment significantly enhanced MHC-I surface expression on lung epithelial (A549) cells and a similar trend was observed for further cell lines of non-hepatic origin (Supplementary Fig. 2C, D).",

While IFN-\u03b3, as expected, increased mRNA expression of both HLA-B and b2m, no effect was detected for alisporivir (Fig. 4\nA; Supplementary Fig. 3A). In line with these data, MHC-I protein levels in Huh6.1 or HepaRG cells were not altered by alisporivir, in contrast to IFN-\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 4B). In addition, we found a slight but significant upregulation of HLA-A\u221702 surface expression on Huh7_Lunet cells ectopically expressing HLA-A\u221702 under control of a heterologous promoter (Huh7_Lunet HLA-A\u221702) [9], further arguing against a mechanism involving regulation of HLA gene expression (Fig. 4C). An enhancement of MHC-I surface expression by alisporivir could also be caused by a general effect on protein surface expression, in line with a previous study reporting an upregulation of pathways associated with protein trafficking by CsA analog NIM-811 [20]. However, neither surface expression of IFN-\u03b3-receptor chain 1 (IFN-\u03b3R1), a type I transmembrane protein like MHC-I \u03b1-chain nor CD13, which is like MHC-I co-translationally glycosylated inside the endoplasmic reticulum and transported through the Golgi to the cell surface [21], was affected by alisporivir treatment (Fig. 4D). A general effect on cellular transport was further excluded, because alisporivir did not affect Gaussia-luciferase (GLuc) secretion, transferrin receptor (TFR) recycling dynamics (Fig. 4E; Supplementary Fig. 3B) or internalization of MHC-I/b2m (Fig. 4F; Supplementary Fig. 3C).

Indeed, we observed a complete inhibition of MHC-I upregulation if alisporivir was combined with proteasome-inhibitors (MG-132 or PS-341), whereas basal MHC-I surface expression was not affected under these conditions (Fig. 5\nA). These results argued for enhanced surface expression primarily of peptide-loaded MHC-I and for a critical role of peptide-availability, suggesting peptide-generation as potential target of alisporivir. Interestingly, a recent study observed upregulation of surface MHC-I upon p53 activation mediated by enhanced expression of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) [23]. We indeed detected a minor but insignificant upregulation of ERAP1 mRNA by alisporivir (Fig. 5B) but found no changes in ERAP1 protein levels or p53 activation status (Fig. 5C\u2013E and data not shown).",

However, simultaneous knockdown of CypA and B did not significantly affect MHC-I surface expression of untreated or alisporivir treated Huh6.1 cells (Fig. 6\nA\u2013C and data not shown), suggesting that these most abundant Cyps were not the main determinants mediating surface accumulation of MHC-I. Cyp-inhibitors cover a broad range of cellular targets, including adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC)-transporters, Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (SLC10A1, NTCP) or calcineurin [24], [25]. Therefore, we tested a panel of compounds with different inhibition profiles [13] for their effect on MHC-I surface expression, using non-cytotoxic concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5C). CsA and the structurally unrelated Cyp-inhibitor sanglifehrin A (SFA) stimulated a significant increase of HLA-A\u221702 and MHC-I surface expression to an extent similar to alisporivir (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Fig. 5A, B), arguing for Cyp-inhibition as underlying cause. In agreement with this assumption, ABC-transporter inhibitors reversan and piperine both did not strongly impact on the amount of surface HLA-A\u221702 or MHC-I, nor did FK506, which inhibits a different group of peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Fig. 5A, B) [5]. In contrast, the cyclic undecapeptides PSC833 and cyclosporine H (CsH), both with reduced affinity at least for the most common Cyps [20], [26] induced a significant upregulation of HLA-A\u221702 and MHC-I surface expression to a similar degree as alisporivir (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). In summary, cyclophilins are most likely the targets responsible for upregulation of MHC-I surface expression.",

Interestingly, CsA also increased MHC-I surface expression, but still entirely blocked functional antigen presentation to T cells by a yet to be defined mechanism [7]. Upregulation of MHC-I surface expression was confirmed in a panel of cell lines of diverse origins and not due to changes in total MHC-I expression levels. Furthermore, alisporivir specifically upregulated MHC-I since neither expression of other surface proteins (CD13, IFN-\u03b3R1) nor overall protein secretion was modified. We also could not find evidence for an impact of alisporivir on MHC-I trafficking, endocytosis or degradation, although we cannot exclude that we missed subtle effects in MHC-I transport dynamics, due to limitations of available assays. Still, we favor a mechanism mediated by enhancing peptide amounts available for MHC-I loading, since the stimulatory effect of alisporivir, but not regular MHC-I surface expression, was completely abrogated by proteasome-inhibitors. We hypothesize, that inhibition of the chaperone-like functions of Cyps by alisporivir might enhance peptide pools available for presentation on MHC-I by increasing the amount of unfolded proteins [24]. Still, further studies are required to clarify the mechanism how alisporivir stimulates MHC-I surface expression.",

            "text": "Cyps are a group of peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases, including at least 17 family members in humans, most of which are poorly studied regarding their inhibition by Cyp-inhibitors and their molecular function [20], [27]. Most Cyp-inhibitors are not restricted to Cyps, but also act against additional targets, like ABC-transporters or Calcineurin [24]. An involvement of Cyps in MHC-I surface upregulation was supported by the fact that all Cyp-inhibitors tested increased MHC-I surface expression, in contrast to FK506, an inhibitor of a different class of peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases [5] and two ABC-transporter inhibitors, reversan and piperine [13]. However, PSC833 and CsH, CsA analogs with reduced affinity for the best studied Cyps [20], [26] induced the same phenotype as observed for CsA, alisporivir and SFA, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of CypA and CypB, the most common Cyps, did not affect MHC-I surface expression, as well as individual knockdown of several other Cyps (data not shown). Altogether, our results either point to a potential role of less studied Cyps, which can still be blocked by all compounds [27] or to a redundant role of many Cyps. Due to the variety of potential targets, the possible involvement of several Cyps with analogous functions, we did not attempt to further define specific Cyps potentially involved in regulation of MHC-I surface expression. For the same reasons and due to high abundance of many Cyps, we neither carried out Cyp-overexpression. Alisporivir, as well as other non-immunosuppressive Cyp-inhibitors like SCY-635 have been in clinical development for antiviral therapy of chronically HCV-infected patients [2], [3], [4] and represent potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs since many viruses depend on CypA as host factor [5], [28]. Based on our in vitro data, we speculate that alisporivir exerts an immunostimulatory effect on hepatocyte antigen presentation during therapy of chronically HCV-infected patients which might complement its antiviral properties by supporting an efficient adaptive immune response. Stimulation of the antigen presentation capacity of hepatocytes, which normally express only low levels of MHC-I [17] might promote recognition of infected cells by CD8+ T cells and finally contribute to their clearance. As previously reported, IFN-free therapy of HCV-infected patients with direct acting antivirals, but not IFN-based treatment, has the potential, to restore functional T cell responses presumably by lowering high antigen levels, which may support T cell exhaustion [29]. Along these lines, it seems plausible, that alisporivir, if applied as an IFN-free regimen, could restore T cell responses even more efficiently and additionally promote clearance of infected cells by CD8+ T cells via enhancing functional antigen presentation. Indeed, immunomodulatory activities on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HCV-infected patients have been observed in clinical trials of the Cyp-inhibitor SCY-635 [30]. To gain insights into the contribution of these immunostimulatory effects of Cyp-inhibitors to the cure of HCV infections, future clinical studies should also monitor the development of T cell responses during therapy. Alternatively, testing the drug in suitable animal models allowing thorough quantification of T cell responses could further shed light on the impact of alisporivir on adaptive immune responses in various organs in vivo. In conclusion, we could demonstrate that non-immunosuppressive Cyp-inhibitors, in striking contrast to CsA, increase functional antigen presentation by upregulation of MHC-I surface expression. Importantly, the enhanced antigen presentation upon alisporivir treatment might also support clearance of other viruses which are sensitive to Cyp-inhibitors.",

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation induced by binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to the NS5BEM-peptide-MHC-I complex stimulates IFN-\u03b3-production which is measured as indirect readout for the antigen presentation capacity of target cells. (B) Various cytokines stimulate antigen presentation by Huh6.1 cells as measured by a co-cultivation assay. Huh6.1 cells expressing NS5BEM, were pretreated with the indicated cytokines and co-cultured with CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells were stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 and surface CD8.
