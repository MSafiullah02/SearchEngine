Over half of the currently recognized pathogens are zoonotic, and nearly all of the most important human pathogens are either zoonotic or originated as zoonoses before adapting to human transmission [4], [5]. Hence, wildlife species play a key role in disease emergence by providing a \u201czoonotic pool\u201d from which previously unknown pathogens may emerge [1]. A major goal of infectious disease research is therefore to characterize those unknown pathogens circulating in animal host reservoirs before they emerge in human populations [6], [7].",

Unlike the other genera of Bunyaviridae, hantaviruses are not known to be transmitted by arthropods, and instead are harbored by small mammals, particularly rodents [9]. The first hantavirus (Thottapalayam virus (TPMV)), was isolated from the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) in India in 1964 [10], but it had not been classified as a Bunyavirus until 1989 [11]. All hantaviruses found subsequently and until 2006 were from Muroidea (i.e. \u2018mouse-like\u2019) rodents. To date, only rodent-borne viruses have been shown to cause human diseases, namely HFRS in Eurasia and HPS in the Americas [8]. As the phylogeny of the rodent-borne hantaviruses appears to be largely congruent with that of subfamily Muridae and family Cricetidae of Muroidea, hantaviruses are often considered to have co-diverged with their rodents hosts over time-scales of millions of years [12]\u2013[15].",

            "text": "Since 2006, at least 22 new species of hantaviruses have been identified in Soricomorpha insectivores (shrews and moles) worldwide [9], [16]. Recently, TPMV was also found in China, Nepal, and Vietnam [17]\u2013[19], and is thought to have had an early evolutionary divergence from rodent-borne hantaviruses [20], [21]. More recently, hantavirus RNA sequences have been detected in bats from western Africa [22], [23]. The presence of newly described hantaviruses in insectivores and bats has challenged the conventional view that hantaviruses originated from rodents, and suggests there may be additional unrecognized hantaviruses circulating in a wide range of animal hosts. Furthermore, that the viruses sampled from rodents and insectivores (Soricomorpha) do not form strict monophyletic groups [22], [24], [25] indicates that host jumping has also occurred during the evolutionary history of these viruses. As a consequence, the respective roles of virus-host co-divergence and cross-species virus transmission are more complex than previously envisioned, although determining the relative frequency of these two processes is critical for understanding the evolutionary and biogeographic processes that have produced the current diversity of hantaviruses and their potential for future emergence.",

Key features of these sequences are described in detail in Table 2 and Figure S1. Clearly, the viruses from bats and shrews are distinct from each other and from other known hantaviruses, representing four novel species of hantavirus (see below). We therefore named these new viruses as Huangpi virus (HUPV), Longquan virus (LQUV), Lianghe virus (LHEV), and Yakeshi virus (YKSV), and which were found in P. abramus, Rhinolophus spp. (R. affinis, R. sinicus, and R. monoceros), A. squamipes, and in S. isodon, respectively. HUPV, LQUV, and YKSV exhibit \u226489.6% sequence similarity in the N, GPC and L proteins from all known hantaviruses (Tables S2, S3). In contrast, LHEV is clearly related to Cao Bang virus (CBNV) also identified in Anourosorex squamipes in Vietnam [26] in sequences of the N (\u226495.6% similarity), GPC (\u226492.7%) and L (\u226494.3%) proteins. However, LHEV is different from CBNV in the GPC protein, exhibiting more than the 7% amino acid difference required for hantavirus species demarcation [9].",

The Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees were rooted in the way suggested by the (molecular clock-rooted) MCC tree. The ML trees based on the M or S segment sequences produced very similar topologies (Figure 2). In the S segment tree (Figure 2A), all known hantaviruses including the viruses identified in bats and insectivores could be placed into four well supported \u2018phylogroups\u2019. The first phylogroup only comprised viruses from insectivore (Soricidae) species and included the Asian viruses TPMV and Imjin virus (MJNV) sampled from the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura) in South Korea [27]. Notably, this phylogroup occupied a basal position with respect to the remaining viruses. The second phylogroup comprised HUPV and LQUV found in bats in this study and which were closely related each other, along with the more divergent Nova virus (NVAV) identified in the European common mole (Talpa europaea) in Hungary [24]. Phylogroup III contained all other known Soricomorpha-associated viruses, including LHEV and YKSV found in this study, as well as a distinct clade of Murinae-borne (i.e. rodent) viruses. Finally, the fourth phylogroup included viruses sampled from the Arvicolinae, Neotominae, and Sigmodontinae subfamilies of rodents, although these did not form three clearly distinct monophyletic groups in the S segment, along with the reassortant RKPV sampled from an insectivore (see below). Importantly, the topologies of ML and Bayesian trees estimated using amino acid sequences of N (encoded by the S segment) and GPC (encoded by the M segment) proteins were consistent with those of the trees based on the nucleotide sequences, indicating that site saturation has not adversely affected our phylogenetic inference (Figure S2A\u2013F). Although a closer phylogenetic relationship between the first and second phylogroups were observed in the Bayesian tree (Figures S2B and S2E), these two phylogroups still occupied basal positions.",

This different phylogenetic pattern was also apparent in the relevant amino acid trees of the N and GPC proteins (Figure S2A\u2013F). Such phylogenetic incongruence is strongly suggestive of reassortment among hantaviruses of phylogroups I and II, and which might have occurred during the evolution of hantaviruses carried by bats and insectivores as these phylogroups are currently only associated with these mammalian species. Irrespective of this history of reassortment it is clear that there have been multiple cross-species transmission events in the evolutionary history of the hantaviruses with, for example, those viruses sampled Soricomorpha forming a paraphyletic group, as do those from bats shown in the L tree.",

With respect to phylogroup III, viruses of Soricomorpha clade have been mainly found in Asia, with a few from Europe, North America, and Africa. With the exception of Sangassou virus (SANGV) found in the wood mice from Guinea [35], almost all viruses of the Murinae clade are from Asia and Europe. Finally, for phylogroup IV, most of the Arvicolinae clade viruses have been identified in Asia and Europe, with a few sampled from North American animals. In contrast, almost all viruses of the Sigmodontinae clade are from the New World, and the lineage comprising LUXV from China and RPKV found in USA occupied a basal position in this clade.

In addition, some viruses exhibited a phylogenetic pattern that reflected their geographic origins rather than the phylogeny of their hosts \u2013 such as viruses OXBV and JMSV, DOBV and SAAV within the Soricomorpha and Murinae clades of phylogroup III (Table S5) \u2013 such that the likelihood of host jumping in part reflects geographic proximity. However, in other instances there were clear matches between the virus and host phylogenies. Most notably, there was significant congruence between phylogenies of the two clades of phylogroup IV and their rodent hosts - Arvicolinae (CE (P = 0.006\u00b10.002) and NCE (P = 0.005\u00b10.002)) and Sigmodontinae (CE (P = 0.041\u00b10.006) and NCE (P = 0.01\u00b10.003)) \u2013 indicating that these rodent hantaviruses may have a long history in their primary hosts, likely co-diverging with their hosts in some cases.",

The hantavirus harbored by three Rhinolophus bats and one carried by the Sorex isodon shrew exhibited \u226489.6% amino acid similarity in the N, GPC and L protein sequences with any recognized hantaviruses, while the hantavirus carried by one Pipistrellus bat shared \u226481.9% amino acid similarity in both the N and L protein sequences with known hantaviruses. The hantavirus found in Anourosorex squamipes (shrew) from Lianghe (Yunnan Province) was most closely related to CBNV also identified in Anourosorex squamipes in Vietnam, but with quite different N (>4.4% amino acid), L (>5.7%), and GPC (>7.3%) amino acid sequences. Interestingly, the mt-cyt b gene differences between Anourosorex squamipes in Yunnan of China and Vietnam are 1.7%, compatible with the existence of the two subspecies of Anourosorex squamipes. According to the criteria for species demarcation in the genus Hantavirus proposed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [9], these four hantaviruses are sufficiently genetically distinct that they should be recognized as distinct species. Accordingly, we propose naming these four novel hantaviruses as Huangpi virus (HUPV), Lianghe virus (LHEV) Longquan virus (LQUV), and Yakeshi virus (YKSV), reflecting their geographic origins. In addition, as LHEV has not been isolated, such that two-way cross neutralization tests cannot be performed, further studies are needed to clarify whether LHEV is a novel species or simply a variant of CBNV. Finally, the identification of LQUV in three Rhinolophus bats also means that hantaviruses may spread relatively easily among different species of bats.",

            "text": "Although rodents are considered the primary hosts of hantaviruses [13], the increasing number of viruses found in insectivore species (shrews and moles) over the past five years has raised an important question mark over the host range and origin of hantaviruses. Indeed, the first hantavirus (TPMV) was isolated from shrews in India in 1964 [10]. Our work further suggests that bats are likely to be important hosts for hantaviruses. Bats (order Chiroptera) have been shown to be sources of a broad variety of emerging pathogens, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses [38]. Recently, partial hantaviral sequences were found in one slit-faced bat (Nycteris hispida) and two banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus) in West Africa [22], [23]. We document two novel hantaviruses in Rhinolophus bats (R. affinis, R. sinicus, R. monoceros) and P. abramus. Consequently, these data, together with other recent studies [22], [23], demonstrate that bats in China and Africa are hosts of hantaviruses and thereby constitute a potential sylvatic mammalian reservoir of hantaviruses. As their global distribution, abundance, ability to fly long distances, often large population densities, and sociality favor the efficient maintenance, evolution, and spread of viruses, it is clear that further study is needed to elucidate the potential importance of bats as hantavirus hosts. Indeed, it seems likely that additional hantaviruses will be isolated from bats, and especially from insectivorous bats as all four bat species in which hantavirus sequences were detected in this study are insectivorous. Moreover, because they consistently occupy basal phylogenetic positions, these phylogenetic data suggest that the ancestor of the extant hantaviruses might have first appeared in Chiroptera and/or Soricomorpha, although this will need to be confirmed on a larger sample of mammalian taxa.",

If hantaviruses have indeed been associated with mammalian species for millions of years, then it is possible that these geographic distributions are long established. The oldest eutherian is Juramaia sinensis (an insectivore) found in China, at an estimated 160 million years ago [40]. It was recently suggested that both Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria, excluding Chiroptera, originated in Eurasia [41]. Geographic reconstructions further suggest that bats originated in the Laurasian land masses, with an Asian origin for the suborder Yinpterochiroptera and a most likely Asian/European origin for the suborder Yangochiroptera [42]. Within the insectivores, Talpidae occupies the basal position within the Soricomorpha [36], [43], and both molecular clock dating and the fossil record suggest a Eurasian origin of the Soricidae [43]\u2013[45]. As the hantaviruses sampled from Asian mammals are genetically very diverse and tend to occupy basal positions in the phylogenetic trees, these data tentatively support an Asian origin for hantaviruses, although this will need to be assessed on a more geographically diverse sample.",

In particular, rodent hantaviruses clustered according to whether their hosts were members of the Murinae subfamily and Cricetidae family. Indeed, the close phylogenetic relationships among some hantavirus taxa across large geographic areas, and which infect related hosts, supports the occurrence of long-term virus-host co-divergence [46]. Hence, rodent hantaviruses might have a long history in their primary hosts, and which in part explains their biodiversity [12]. Despite this, more examples of incongruence between the gene trees of hantaviruses and their hosts are being identified, suggesting that some of the congruence between the two might have arisen from preferential host switching and local adaptation [25]. Indeed, it was recently shown that cross-species transmission has even played a role in shaping the genetic diversity of the currently known Murinae-associated hantaviruses [46]. In accord with this, the current study provides evidence for cross-species transmission events at the family, genus, and species levels. In particular, that viruses from both the Chiroptera and Soricomorpha form paraphyletic groups in all our analyses strongly suggests that ancestral hantaviruses jumped between mammalian orders. As a consequence, it is clear that cross-species virus transmission as well as the geographic dispersal of Chiroptera, Soricomorpha and Rodentia, has also contributed to the high biodiversity and near global distribution of those hantaviruses known today, although the time-scale of these host jumping events remains uncertain.",

In the amplification of the 5\u2032 terminus of unknown hantaviruses, an adaptor plus P14 was used as a primer in the synthesis of cDNA. Semi-PCR was used to amplify the 5\u2032 terminus with the adaptor as the forward primer and two specific reverse primers. Semi-PCR was also used to amplify the 3\u2032 terminus with two specific forward primers and an adaptor plus modified P14 (5\u2032-TAGTAGTRGACWCC-3\u2032) [52] as the reverse primer. Primer sequences used in this study are provided in Table S6. The RT-PCR products were separated by agarose gel and further purified using the Agarose Gel DNA Purification kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Amplicons less than 700 bp were sequenced from both directions. Amplicons greater than 700 bp were cloned into pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China).

TreeAnnotator was used to generate a Maximum Cade Credibility (MCC) tree with a burn-in of 10% of the sampled trees. Because the MCC tree is automatically rooted on the assumption of a molecular clock it enables determination of which viral lineages are most likely to be basal. Accordingly, the basal lineage estimated by the MCC tree was used as an outgroup to root the phylogenetic trees inferred under the ML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. In addition, because the high levels of sequence divergence across the hantaviruses, we also inferred phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequences of the L protein, N protein (encoded by the S segment), and GPC protein (encoded by the M segment) using the ML approach available in the phyML program [59].

A tanglegram was generated by matching each hantavirus species to their associated host(s). Specifically, nodes of the viral MCC tree were mapped onto the related nodes of the host (MCC) tree. Significance testing was undertaken by generating 1000 viral trees with randomized branches and mapping these random trees onto the fixed host tree. We then evaluated the proportion of these reconciliations with the same or fewer non-co-divergence events (NCEs), or the same or more co-divergence events (CEs), compared to the \u201creal\u201d viral tree. If the p value is greater than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis that the level of congruence is no more than that expected between randomly generated trees. Due to computational limitations in TreeMap [61], we reduced the complexity of the host and virus phylogenies as much as possible before performing the full reconciliation analysis. Thus, for viruses-host matches, we divided all hantaviruses and their hosts into four groups: (i) bats and insectivores and their viruses (Rockport virus (RKPV) was removed because it was a reassortant virus), (ii) Murinae and their viruses, (iii) Arvicolinae and their viruses (Luxi virus (LUXV) was removed because it was a reassortant virus), and (iv) Sigmodontinae and their viruses. For the full reconciliation analysis, three species (virus or host) representing each of four groups (bats and insectivores, Murinae, Arvicolinae, and Sigmodontinae) were used to compare the host and the virus phylogenies (and including Scalopus aquaticus and RKPV, Eothenomys miletus and LUXV). Cross-species transmission events were then inferred by comparing the topologies of the virus and host phylogenies. Specifically, we considered the degree of congruence between the viral S, M, and S+M segment trees with that of the host mt-cyt b gene tree (Figure 5, Figure S4; Table S5). Importantly, any viruses or hosts exhibiting phylogenetic uncertainty were excluded from the analysis.",
