CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full text papers. Since its release, CORD-19 has been downloaded over 75K times and has served as the basis of many COVID-19 text mining and discovery systems. In this article, we describe the mechanics of dataset construction, highlighting challenges and key design decisions, provide an overview of how CORD-19 has been used, and preview tools and upcoming shared tasks built around the dataset. We hope this resource will continue to bring together the computing community, biomedical experts, and policy makers in the search for effective treatments and management policies for COVID-19. 4 https://www.who.int/emergencies/ diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/globalresearch-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov 5 https://creativecommons.org/ 6 https://unpaywall.org/",

Though many publishers have generously made COVID-19 papers available during this time, there are still bottlenecks to information access. For example, papers describing research in related areas (e.g., on other infectious diseases, or relevant biological pathways) are not necessarily open access, and are therefore not available in CORD-19 or otherwise. Publishers have begun to share information about their search strategies and, with support from the NLM and OSTP, to work on identifying other topic areas that would be helpful to include in their search strings. Though the intention of the CORD-19 dataset is not to allow users to read or \"consume\" the constituent papers, our release of full text does constitute a form of re-publication, which is limited by copyright restrictions. Securing release rights for papers not yet in CORD-19 is a significant portion of future work, led by the PMC COVID-19 Initiative. 41 Lastly, there is no standard format for representing paper metadata. Existing schemas like the NLM's JATS XML NISO standard, 42 Crossref's bibliographic field definitions, or library science standards like BIBFRAME 43 or Dublin Core 44 have been adopted as representations for paper metadata. However, there are issues with these standards; they can be too coarse-grained to capture all necessary paper metadata elements, or lack a strict schema, causing representations to vary greatly across publishers who use them. Additionally, metadata for papers relevant to CORD-19 are not all readily available in one of these standards. There is therefore neither an appropriate, well-defined schema for representing paper metadata, nor consensus usage of any particular schema by different publishers and archives. To improve metadata coherence across sources, the community must come together to define and agree upon an appropriate standard of representation.",
