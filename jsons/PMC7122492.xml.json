            "text": "Until fairly recently, it has been customary, in the absence of clinically significant infection, to view the human organism as an isolated entity. In fact, the healthy human body always contains a large number of foreign cells and viruses (Virgin et al., 2009; Dethlefsen et al., 2007; Relman, 2002). There are more viral particles in the human body than microbial cells, which are ten times more numerous than eukaryotic (human) cells. Similarly, only about 1.5% of the human genome encodes recognizable \u201chuman proteins,\u201d whereas approximately 45% our genome is retrotransposons, DNA transposons, and viral sequences. Most of the human-associated microbes and viruses, often found on \u201cexternal\u201d surfaces lining the lumens of organs such as the gut and oral/nasal cavities, participate in complex commensal or mutualistic relationships with their human host (Dethlefsen et al., 2007; Relman, 2002). Therefore, it is not advantageous to attempt to eradicate every virus and microbial cell from the body in response to infection. A new medical paradigm is emerging: an illness may be defined by a disruption of the normal \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome and/or virome, and that restoration of this state, not elimination of all nonhuman organisms, should be the goal of medical treatment (Harrison, 2007). Current interest in the human microbiome reflects the increasing acceptance of the view that the microbiota per se should not be seen merely as invasive disease vectors but are in fact an intrinsic part of the human supra-organism (Dethlefsen et al., 2007).",

Koch\u2019s postulates (Rivers, 1937) dictate the conditions under which a virus cultured in vitro should be regarded as the cause of an infectious disease; human viruses are usually cultured only in this context. In addition, culturing will be successful only for the small fraction of viruses for which appropriate culture conditions can be determined. To break from the limited view that all viruses are intrinsically harmful requires new methodologies that enable us to characterize entire uncultured viral communities. A culture-independent metagenomics approach to viral community analysis will yield a broader view of the human virome, just as metagenomic sequencing has revealed a wider range of bacteria in the human microbiome than culture-based methods (Harris et al., 2007; Rogers et al., 2004).",

Pyrosequencing (Roche/454 Life Sciences), as well as other technologies (e.g., Solexa, SOLiD), enable routine DNA sequencing on the scale of 108 bp. All of these new high-throughput methods replace traditional cloning in bacteria with mechanical separation of DNA molecules by some means (e.g., emPCR with DNA immobilized on beads for 454). This requires the creation of a minimally biased DNA library that better reflects the viral community in the sample. At present, the original DNA sample must often be amplified before sequencing, increasing the opportunity for artificial over- or underrepresentation of particular sequences. Despite this limitation, these methods appear to avoid most of the problems associated with conventional cloning, which is subject to strong sequence bias against some \u201cunclonable\u201d sequences. This phenomenon appears to be particularly pronounced in attempts to clone viral sequences. Microarrays, as well, remain semi-quantitative detection methods because it is impossible to simultaneously optimize the hybridization of thousands of individual sequences (Table 4.1).\n\n",

The human body is composed of about 1013 cells (Savage, 1977). There are about 10 times this number of microbial cells associated with the healthy human body (Savage, 1977). The observed ratio of 7\u201310 viral-like particles per microbial cell in environmental (Rohwer, 2003) and human samples (Furlan, 2009) means that we could expect to find about 1015 phages in the body. It is possible to compare this prediction with results from recent studies. The data in Table 4.2 are from direct counts of viruses using epifluorescence microscopy. These data indicate the presence of approximately 3 \u00d7 1012 viruses in the body.\n\n",

The human-associated viruses are unevenly distributed, with the bulk of the virome composed of a handful of dominant species (Table 4.3). In the limited data available to date, it appears that a disease state is correlated with an increase in the diversity of the virome (Willner et al., 2009a). Most of the viruses are phages. There are also certain eukaryotic viruses, such as herpesviruses, anelloviruses, and papillomaviruses, that are ubiquitous in the human virome and tend to cause few problems considering their abundance (Virgin et al., 2009).

By killing specific host organisms, phages regulate the absolute and relative abundance of microbial species (Breitbart et al., 2005). Genetic variation in the hosts is therefore favored as a means of escaping phage predation (Kunin et al., 2008). In addition, phages are major vehicles of DNA transfer to and from host cells (horizontal gene transfer) through both lytic and lysogenic pathways (Little, 2005), potentially conferring new phenotypes that can increase the pathogenicity (Breitbart et al., 2005) or the fitness (Sharon et al., 2009; Wagner and Waldor, 2002) of the host. Analysis of the phage metagenome can thus provide information not only about potential host taxonomy, but also reveal potential metabolic pathways available to the microbial community (Willner et al., 2009a; Sharon et al., 2009).

In asymptomatic subjects, the abundance of these viruses is far lower than that of phages in the healthy human body (Willner et al., 2009a, 2010). Depending on the area of the body under examination, the presence of eukaryotic viruses will be due to either transient environmental exposure of accessible regions (e.g., the lungs) or chronic infections that do not give rise to recognizable clinical symptoms. The lack of symptoms might reflect a low-level viral infection that is successfully suppressed by the immune system at an early stage, or perhaps a commensal virus that causes no apparent harm (Virgin et al., 2009; Stapleton et al., 2004; Okamoto, 2009; Antonsson et al., 2000). An example of the latter is Torque Teno Virus (TTV), which was originally thought to be associated with a form of hepatitis, but now seems likely to be a ubiquitous but benign commensal virus (Okamoto, 2009). Instances of true viral\u2013human mutualism in this context are not yet well understood, but it has been suggested that co-infection with GB Virus Type C (originally termed Hepatitis G virus) reduces mortality in HIV-infected individuals (Stapleton et al., 2004).

Viral RNA is converted to cDNA using primers containing random octamers for both first- and second-strand synthesis, followed by PCR amplification. These methods have been successful in identifying many RNA viruses from human samples. Examples can be found in Victoria et al. (2009), Nakamura et al. (2009), and Jones et al. (2005). The method may be limited by PCR amplification bias, but it is highly sensitive.",

In many cases the phage community appears to carry genes that complement the functions of the microbial community. In particular, phages often seem to use genes for proteins that will increase the short-term energy output of the host cells, either to increase viability (lysogeny) or to boost the production of viral particles (lytic).

If a sequence has no similarity to the DNA of known organisms as defined by BLAST (McGinnis and Madden, 2004) or similar search algorithms, other methods must be developed for this purpose. For example, genome organization patterns such as large-scale arrangements of open reading frames or regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, and origins of replication) may be signatures that would identify sequences as being of viral origin. This approach would likely require long sequences or even complete genomes to be successful.",
