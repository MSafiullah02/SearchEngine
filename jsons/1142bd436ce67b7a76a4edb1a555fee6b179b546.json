            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health threat and economic burden in affected countries. The availability of genomic data is key to understanding viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies. Currently, the use of highthroughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR-amplified viral sequences (amplicon sequencing), is potentially the most informative approach to monitor viral dissemination and genetic diversity by providing, in a single methodological step, identification and characterization of the whole viral genome at the nucleotide level. Despite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper the reproducibility and comparison of results. Here we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerized and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV short-read sequencing data from both amplicon and shotgun metagenomics approaches. It is able to infer the DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify the serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree. It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement for extensive bioinformatics expertise. Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two types of DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples from patients with variable serotypes and genotypes, including an in vitro spiked sample containing the four known serotypes. The second consisted of 106 paired-end and 76 single-end amplicon sequences of DENV 3 genotype III and DENV 1 genotype I, respectively, where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity. The DEN-IM workflow, parameters and execution configuration files, and documentation are freely available at https:// github. com/ B-UMMI/ DEN-IM).",

Infection with DENV results in symptoms ranging from mild fever to haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome [1] . Transmission to humans occurs through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes, namely Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus [2] . In 2010, it was predicted that the burden of dengue disease would reach 390 million cases per year worldwide [3] . Dengue has the greatest clinical significance of any arbovirus because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with it [4] . DENV is a significant public health challenge in countries where infection is endemic due to the high health and economic burden. Despite the emergence of novel therapies and ecological strategies to control the mosquito vector, there are still important knowledge gaps concerning the virus biology and its epidemiology [2] .",

Due to the high sensitivity of these technologies, previous studies have shown that viral sequences can be obtained directly from patient sera using a shotgun metagenomics approach [6] . Alternatively, HTS can be used in an amplicon sequencing approach in which a PCR step is used to preamplify viral sequences before sequencing. In recent years, HTS has been used successfully as a tool for the identification of DENV directly from clinical samples with as few as ~2 reads in a total of 10 6 reads [6, 7] . This also allows the rapid identification of the serotype and genotype, which is important for disease management, as the genotype may be associated with disease outcome [8] .",

            "text": "The risk of exposure to DENV is increasing, not only because of travel to endemic regions, but also due to the broader dissemination of the mosquito, making the burden of dengue very significant. The decreasing costs and wider availability of high-throughput (HTS) sequencing make it an ideal technology to monitor dengue virus's (DENV's) transmission. Metagenomics approaches decrease the time required to obtain nearly complete DENV sequences without the need for timeconsuming viral culture through the direct processing and sequencing of patient samples. A ready-to-use bioinformatics workflow, enabling the reproducible analysis of DENV, is therefore particularly relevant for the development of a straightforward HTS workflow. DEN-IM was designed to perform a comprehensive analysis in order to generate either assemblies or consensus of full DENV coding sequences and to identify their serotype and genotype. DEN-IM can also detect all four DENV serotypes and the respective genotypes present in a spiked sample, raising the possibility that DEN-IM can play a role in the identification of co-infection cases whose prevalence is increasingly perceived in highly endemic areas. Although it is ready to use, the DEN-IM workflow can be easily customized to the user's needs. DEN-IM enables reproducible and collaborative research, and is accessible to a wide group of researchers, regardless of their computational expertise and the resources available. The raw sequencing reads are provided as input to the first block (in blue), responsible for quality control and elimination of low-quality reads and sequences. After successful preprocessing of the reads, these enter the second block (green) for retrieval of the DENV reads using the mapping database of 3858 complete DENV genomes as a reference. This block also provides an initial estimate of the sequencing depth. After the de novo assembly and assembly correction block (yellow), the CDSs are retrieved and then classified with the reduced-complexity DENV typing database containing 161 sequences representing the known diversity of DENV serotypes and genotypes (red). If a complete CDS fails to be assembled, the reads are mapped against the DENV typing database and a consensus sequence is obtained for classification and phylogenetic inference. All CDSs are aligned and compared in a phylogenetic analysis (purple). Lastly, a report is compiled (grey) with the results of all the blocks of the workflow.",

In the shotgun metagenomics and the single-end amplicon sequencing datasets the closest typing reference in the final tree and the NCBI DENV references for each serotype were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The negative control and the 92-1001 sample had no reads after trimming and filtering of low-complexity reads, and so they were removed from further analysis (see Table S3 ). When mapping to the DENV mapping database, the percentage of DENV reads in the 21 clinical samples, the positive control and the spiked sample passing QC ranged from 0.01 % (sample UCUG0186) to 85.38 % (positive control -PC -sample). After coverage depth estimation, the analysis of the samples 91-0115 and UCUG0186 was terminated due to a low proportion of DENV reads (0.05 and 0.01 %, respectively). They failed to meet the threshold criterion of having an estimated depth of coverage of \u226510\u00d7 (estimated coverages of 3.17\u00d7 and 5.65\u00d7, respectively).",

Indeed, recent studies from areas of high endemicity suggest that co-infection with multiple DENV serotypes may occur frequently [29, 30] and the co-circulation of different DENV strains of the same serotype, but distinct genotypes, in these areas [29] raises the possibility of simultaneous infection with more than one genotype.",
