Dogs can act as a transport for ticks into human dwellings and can transfer ticks directly to humans during human-dog interactions such as petting or bathing. A history of recent tick removal from a family pet might be useful in evaluating the potential for human tick exposure.

Data shows at least one-third of seropositive RMSF or ehrlichiosis patients do not remember being bitten [1, 5]. Patients may attribute a bite to other insects such as mosquitos, spiders, chiggers, or fleas which may be indistinguishable from a tick bite. Transmission of the tick-borne infection from the tick to the host occurs while the tick is feeding and has been attached to the host for about 6\u201310 h.
