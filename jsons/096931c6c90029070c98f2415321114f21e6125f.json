The causative agent was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease COVID-19. As of 17 March 2020, 80,894 cases of COVID-19 were reported in China of which 3237 (4%) were fatal. In Wuhan, 2490 (4.98%) of 50,005 cases died. In addition, 98,218 cases from 104 countries outside of China were laboratory-confirmed, of which 4189 (4.27%) were fatal. A previous study suggested that the condition of 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and they died of multiple organ failure [2] , while Wang et al. [3] reported that 4.3% of COVID-19 cases were fatal. A national study of 1099 patients with COVID-19 found that 55 patients (5%) were admitted to an intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed to the infection [4] . It is important to emphasize that most patients studied previously were hospitalized and thus the full spectrum of COVID-19 severity is still being elucidated [1] [2] [3] [4] . We aimed to further explore the clinicolaboratory characteristics, hospital complications and treatments of 25 fatal cases of COVID-19. The clinicolaboratory characteristics of survivors (N = 149) and non-survivors were also compared.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 135, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 638, "end": 641, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 662, "end": 665, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1045, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1049, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1053, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This was a single-center retrospective analysis.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (shock), secondary bacterial infection and acute cardiac/kidney/liver injury were common during hospitalization.

We speculate that the pathogenesis of fatal cases might involve uncontrolled release of immune mediators (i.e., a 'cytokine storm'). Ruan et al. [6] also suggested that COVID-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated \"cytokine storm syndrome\" or fulminant myocarditis [6] . Tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor) had been used to treat cytokine storm syndrome [10] , and a clinical trial to assess its use in COVID-19 patients has been registered.
