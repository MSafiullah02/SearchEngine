Although subsequently challenged (Dye and Siddel, 2007, Brown et al., 2009), the internal mutation theory has been validated by several recent studies (Chang et al., 2010, Chang et al., 2011, Pedersen et al., 2009). FECV mutants that attain the FIP biotype have gained tropism for macrophages (reviewed Pedersen, 2009). This altered tropism allows the virus to stray from its normal host cell (mature intestinal epithelium) and become a systemic pathogen of macrophages, a cell type that is at the core of both innate and adaptive immunity. The type and strength of immune responses to this macrophage infection is thought to dictate whether or not a cat becomes diseased, and if diseased, the form it takes (reviewed Pedersen, 2009).",

            "text": "Mutations that increase macrophage tropism were originally thought to reside solely in the 3c gene, to work by altering the size of the gene product, and to be unique to each cat dying of FIP (Vennema et al., 1998, Pedersen et al., 2009). The 3c is one of 11 genes in the feline coronavirus genome and it is uncertain whether it is an integral part of the virion and its exact function in the virus life-cycle. It encodes a triple-spanning membrane protein that is similar in hydropathic profile, but not sequence, to the M protein (Oostra et al., 2006). Although the basic role of internal mutation endures, the essential role of 3c mutations in the FECV to FIPV conversion has been questioned. It is now apparent that one-third or more of FIPV isolates have 3c genes that are intact, which is the case for all FECVs (Chang et al., 2010). Based on their findings, Chang and colleagues (2010) concluded that whereas an intact 3c is essential for intestinal replication, functional mutations in 3c are not essential for increased macrophage tropism and FIP. However, neither of these conclusions was tested by experimental cat inoculation studies. Rather, the disease potential (biotype) of their coronavirus isolates was defined by their origins, i.e., FECV if they were found in feces and FIPVs if they were isolated from diseased tissues. The implications of these findings go beyond the nature of the FIPV mutation(s). If FIPVs with intact 3c can replicate in the intestine, they may also transmit cat-to-cat. This is counter to the current corollary that FIPV is rarely if ever transmitted horizontally and that cats with FIP are therefore not risks for other cats (reviewed by Pedersen, 2009, Pedersen et al., 2009).",

The FECV and FIPV isolates used in this study were obtained from a large metropolitan shelter in San Francisco that receives kittens and adult cats from the Bay Area. The shelter staff educates owners about the health problems that may occur in their new pet, with emphasis on serious diseases such as FIP. Owners are also encouraged to seek veterinary care from the shelter staff or private veterinarians if FIP or signs of FIP occur. As a result of these practices, many of the FIP cases among adoptees come to the attention of the shelter staff. Therefore, this collaboration yielded a large number of both FIPV and FECV isolates. The E, M, 3a\u2013c genes were then sequenced and used to categorize the various isolates for their 3c gene status. A subset of these genetically characterized isolates were then used to infect laboratory cats both oronasally and by the i.p. route to determine their disease potential and ability to replicate in the intestine. Additional studies were also conducted on isolates obtained after animal passage.",

This shelter intakes approximately 3000 cats a year, about 50% of which are kittens. Cats and kittens are obtained from a local animal control shelter, from local citizens, or from a number of regional orphan and abandoned kitten foster/rescue organizations. Older kittens are often taken directly into the shelter, while kittens received at 4\u20135 weeks of age are immediately transferred to local volunteer foster caregivers. Foster caregivers house one to several litters of kittens at a time until they attain the necessary age and weight for spaying or castration (9\u201312 weeks and 0.9\u20131.0 kg), at which time they are returned to the SF SPCA shelter. There is a biphasic peak in kitten numbers in the shelter with the first peak in spring, a decrease in August and September and a second wave around October through December. Kitten numbers decrease to very low levels during the winter (January to March/early April). This seasonal rush causes crowding at all levels of the kitten relinquishment/adoption cycle and the incidence of coronavirus infection correlates with population density, i.e., low in winter and high in late spring and early summer.",

Fecal virus shedding was not detected in cats from these experiments, with one exception. The exception occurred among cats infected oronasally with inoculum m3c-1 in experiment 4B (Table 4). Six out of six infected cats developed FIP and shed virus in their feces. An identical double deletion 3c mutant was isolated from tissues (ddFIPV-tissue) and feces (ddFIPV-feces) of all six cats. This mutant, which was not present at detectable levels in the m3c-1 inoculum, was traced back to the diseased tissues of cat SFS-20 using ddFIPV specific PCR. Tissue from SFS-20 was subsequently found to contain two variants. One variant had an intact 3c and one had a double deletion mutation in 3c (ddFIPV). ddFIPV (tissue) caused FIP in 7/7 cats by the i.p. route (Expt. 7B, Table 4) and in none of two cats given the inoculum orally (Expt. 8B, Table 4). No fecal shedding was detected when ddFIPV(tissue) was the sole virus in the inoculum (Expt. 8B, Table 4). The ddFIPV(feces) isolate did not cause FIP in cats by either oral or i.p routes, but was briefly shed (days 4\u20137) following oral infection (Expts. 9B, 10B; Table 4). It was replaced in the feces by FECV-1 sometime between dpi 7 and 30 as a result of an inadvertent exposure to a cat in Expt. 1B (Table 4).",

This was done for two reasons: (1) to test the disease potential of a greater number of coronavirus isolates using fewer laboratory cats and (2) to study the relative infectivity of different strains. Care was taken that each mixture contained only variants with either intact 3c or mutated 3c. Following infection with a mixture of isolates, only one or two strains were associated with disease and the infecting strain(s) often varied from cat to cat among an experimental group (Fig. 5\n) The infecting strain(s) were either identical to the strain(s) found in the inoculum or a recombinant. For example, one of the infecting variants in Cat-025 and Cat-022 was a recombinant between two isolates that were present in the infecting material (Fig. 5). The predominant infecting strain could also possess mutations not detected in the parent virus (Cat-007, 016, 025, 026, 027, Fig. 5a). In one study (Expt. 3B), which used an inoculum (m3c-1) made from diseased tissues of four cats and presumably contained four mutated 3c variants, the infecting virus in five of six cats was a double 3c deletion mutant (ddFIPV) not initially detected in the inoculum (Fig. 5b).",

(2010) on the role of the 3c gene, except that the biotypes of coronavirus isolates from both healthy and FIP diseased cats were confirmed by infection of laboratory cats. Animal inoculation studies confirmed the basic conclusions of Chang et al. (2010), but with some modifications. Their first conclusion was that an intact 3c was essential for intestinal replication. Indeed, all FECVs studied had intact 3c genes and were infectious by the oronasal route and shed at high levels in the feces. However, one of three cats infected i.p. with FECVs did shed virus from the feces, indicating that FECVs could reach the gut from the peritoneal cavity, but with some difficulty. Therefore, intestinal vs. macrophage tropism of FECVs may be relative rather than absolute. A second conclusion of Chang et al. (2010) was that mutations in 3c were not essential to cause FIP. Indeed, FIPVs with intact and functionally mutated 3c genes were equally capable of causing FIP when given by either oronasal or i.p. routes. Therefore, truncating mutations of 3c were not essential in causing FIP. Chang et al. (2010) also predicted that FIPVs with truncated 3c genes would not infect the intestine following oral infection and would not be shed in the feces. Although true for most isolates, there was again one exception. A 3c double deletion mutant (ddFIPV) was shed from the gut following oral infection with the m3c-1 inoculum. However, a fecal extract from laboratory cats shedding this particular mutant was not infectious for laboratory cats by the oronasal route. It is noteworthy that the original inoculum containing ddFIPV also contained a variant with an intact 3c gene. This variant was no longer detected in feces after passage in laboratory cats. It is possible that ddFIPV used this variant as a helper for intestinal replication during its initial passage in laboratory cats.",

The surprising finding in the present study was the lack of infectivity of coronaviruses that were shed in the feces of cats that were infected oronasally with FIPVs possessing an intact 3c. This lack of infectivity also applied to the novel double-deletion 3c mutant that appeared in the tissues and feces of cats infected with the m3c-1 inoculum and to a fecal virus from a cat with naturally acquired FIP that possessed the same intact 3c as the lesional virus. The reason for this lack of infectivity cannot be explained at this time, but is another example of the complexities of FIP pathogenesis. However, these findings support one corollary of the internal mutation theory, i.e., cats with FIP do not appear to effectively transmit FIP horizontally to other cats (Pedersen, 2009).",

            "text": "It is generally assumed that FECVs are tropic for the mature intestinal epithelium, while FIPVs are tropic for macrophages. This implies that FECV infection is entirely contained within the intestinal tract. However, several studies have shown that FECV infection has both an intestinal and a systemic phase, and that the systemic phase involves monocyte-macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010, Vogel et al., 2010). This again suggests that intestinal and monocyte-macrophage tropisms of FECVs and FIPVs are relative and not absolute. This would explain how FECV was able to reach the intestinal epithelium in one of three cats infected with FECV by the i.p. route. If FECVs can replicate briefly in macrophage/monocytes, then the mutational transformation of an FECV to an FIPV may actually occur in monocyte-macrophages rather than intestinal epithelial cells. Such a scenario takes into account the high mutability of FECV and FIPV both within and between cats (Pedersen et al., 2009). The mutation rate may also be greater during replication in macrophages than intestinal epithelial cells, as indicated by the present study. High mutability would provide ample opportunity for positive selection for macrophage tropism. The better and longer an FECV can survive in macrophages following primary or secondary infections, the more adapted to macrophage growth it would become and the more virulent in terms of FIP. Indeed, Stoddart and Scott (1989) demonstrated that the ability of an FIPV to replicate in macrophages increased with its virulence for cats. Mutational events (SNPs, insertions, deletions) in the present study were also found to be much more common in FIPVs than FECVs both in natural and experimental infections, indicating that FIPVs are under much more mutational pressure than FECVs.",

The timing of acquisition of serum antibodies in experimental FIPV, either by passive or active immunization, always coincides with the onset of disease (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980). Antibodies greatly enhance the uptake and replication of coronavirus in macrophages and contribute to subsequent disease signs through an arthus type reaction (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982, Olsen et al., 1992, Pedersen and Boyle, 1980, Pedersen, 1986, Weiss and Scott, 1981). FIPV specific antibodies allow the mutant coronavirus an alternative pathway to enter macrophages, i.e., by Fc receptors. Therefore, the fate of the host cat may be linked to its ability to contain primary FECV replication in monocyte-macrophages before antibodies appear. In the present study, as with other studies of experimental FIP infection (reviewed Pedersen, 2009), a proportion of cats appear to resist experimental FIPV infection from the onset. The importance of an intact immune system in this initial containment has been demonstrated in a previous study using FECV infection of aged FIV infected cats and their non-infected siblings (Poland et al., 1996). There also appears to be a genetic component to FIP susceptibility (Foley and Pedersen, 1996).",

A comparison 3a\u2013c, E, and M nucleotide and amino acid sequences of FECVs and FIPVs in the present study also failed to find any consistent differences in the 3a, 3b, E, and M gene sequences or products that would implicate these genes in FIP. One FIPV isolate (SFS-01) in the present study had a premature stop codon in the region overlapping 3a, b, another (SFS-11) had a mutation that resulted in an extended 3b protein and no 3c product, and two FIPV isolates had 3 nt and 27 nt deletions in the M protein. The 7a and 7b genes and their products were not studied herein, because isolates of both FECVs and FIPVs with significant mutations have been found to coexist in nature (Kennedy et al., 2001, Lin et al., 2009). Furthermore, deletion of 7b causes FIPVs to become avirulent (Herrewegh et al., 1995). Finally, significant mutations in 7a and 7b were not observed in a previous comparison of FIPVs and FECVs (Pedersen et al., 2009). Previous studies have also failed to implicate the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) genes in the FECV to FIPV biotype conversion (Battilani et al., 2010, Vennema et al., 1998). It is also possible that alternative FIP causing mutations may exist in the first two open reading frames comprising the replicase genes, which collectively make up more than two-thirds of the genome. However, the replicase tends to be highly conserved and mutations in these genes would be expected to inhibit virus replication and decrease virulence.",

            "text": "Although a singular importance of 3c mutations in the evolution of FIPVs has been questioned (Chang et al., 2010), such a conclusion may be premature in light of what is now known about variants. Although 60% of FIPVs have a functionally mutated 3c, such mutants often coexist with intact 3c variants in the same lesions. The opposite situation is also true in some cats. The pressure to progressively truncate 3c is also evident upon experimental cat passage (Pedersen et al., 2009). These observations suggest that mutations ultimately causing FIP do not start with the acquisition of premature stop codons, or frame shifting deletions and insertions that alter the size of the 3c product. FIPV causing isolates with intact 3c genes in the present study had four times more unique non-synonymous amino acid mutations in the 3\u2032 one-third of their 3c protein than FECVs. Although, Chang et al. (2010) reported no differences between 3c of their FECVs and FIPVs with intact 3c, a comparison of their FECV and FIPV 3c gene sequences obtained from GenBank also showed a similar trend from amino acid positions 160 to 240 of the 3c protein. The number of predicted non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in this region in 26 of their FECVs was 0.65/isolate compared to 2.0/isolate for 10 of their FIPV isolates. However, these differences may reflect a higher replication rate in macrophages vs. intestinal epithelial cells and play no role in FIP virulence. The ultimate answer as to the nature of FIP causing mutations may require, as suggested by Chang et al. (2011), the creation of infectious molecular clones of the basic feline enteric coronavirus by forward or reverse genetic manipulations, site directed mutagenesis to mimic various genotypes, and animal inoculation studies to confirm the resultant phenotype. Unfortunately, a true FECV has not been adapted to cell culture and most FIPVs also cannot be grown in vitro and the essential reagents are still missing.",

These observations highlight essential differences in the dynamics of coronavirus infection in shelters vs. catteries or stable multi-cat environments.

            "text": "A failure to understand the dynamics of coronavirus infection in stable vs. unstable cat populations can lead to very different conclusions on the origins of FIP causing coronaviruses. Brown and colleagues (2009) also did a genetic comparison of coronavirus isolates from 48 healthy and 8 FIP affected cats from a comparable large regional shelter in the Northeast of the United States. They concluded that FIP virus isolates were genetically distinguishable from enteric type coronaviruses in the shelter based on combinations of five specific amino acids at positions 108, 120, 138, 163, and 199 in the M protein. Two of these sequences, YIVAL (I) or YIIAL (II), were purportedly found in all cats with FIP, while isolates from healthy coronavirus infected cats were HIIVI (III), HIIVL (IV), HVIAL (V), or YVVAL (VI), and uncommonly YIVAL (I). In agreement with Chang et al. (2011), the present results confirmed that these particular amino acid sequences in M have no value in distinguishing FECVs from FIPVs. All but two of the 32 FIPV and 27 FECV isolates in the present study had YIVAL(I) in their M protein. One FIPV isolate (SFS-50) had threonine (T) instead of alanine (A) at amino acid position 163, and one FECV (SFS-39) had an isoleucine (I) instead of valine (V) at position 120 and a valine (V) instead of isoleucine (I) at position 138. An alternative explanation for the conclusion of Brown et al. (2009) was that FCoV populations in a shelter are changing continually depending on the age of cats at the time of acquisition and their prior environmental exposure history. In order to trace the origins of FIP viruses in cats that have passed through shelters, one must sample feces prior to the usual age of primary coronavirus infection (9\u201310 weeks of age; Pedersen et al., 2008) and in subsequent exposure situations preceding the development of FIP.",
