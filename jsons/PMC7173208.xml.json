            "text": "Cattle with BRD may not exhibit clinical signs or lesions definitive for specific etiology. Veterinarians use diagnostic laboratories for diagnosis using samples from affected animals. There are two primary ways diagnostic laboratories and veterinarians collaborate on laboratory testing for BRD infectious agents in feedlot cattle: testing of submitted samples from fatal cases collected at necropsy and ante mortem samples such nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal washing materials, and peripheral blood. Such testing permits the detection of multiple agents including viruses and bacteria, depending on the tests available. Several studies using samples collected at necropsy and tested for several viruses by a variety of tests are listed [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Studies testing for multiple viruses from respiratory materials affected cattle ante mortem such as swabs included the following are listed [9], [10], [11], [12]. For many years \u201ctraditional tests\u201d, culture assays were used to identify viruses, however \u201cmodern tests\u201d, molecular tests have become commonplace. Historically, the mainstay for virology workups on BRD cases was a combination of immunofluorescence and attempted viral isolation. In the past two decades, molecular assays have increasingly supplanted classical methods. Strengths and weaknesses of traditional and molecular tests and interpretation were reported [13]. Issues facing clinicians includes interpretation of positive tests from animals with BRD signs with prior MLV vaccination. Discretion should be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests of recently MLV vaccinated cattle with BRD. Does the identified virus or positive nucleic acid represent virulent field infections or MLV strains?",

Inoculums were adsorbed onto one-day-old monolayers of Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells in 24-well plates for 2 h at 35.5 \u00b0C. Medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum was added to monolayers and incubated at 35.5 \u00b0C. Plates were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) for 6 days, then cells were trypsinized and tested for noncytopathic (NCP) BVDV by direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT). When CPE was observed, remaining cells were trypsinized, transferred onto spot slides, and stained by DFAT using commercial fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies against BVDV, BoHV-1, BRSV, or bovine PI3V (Veterinary Medical Research and Development, Pullman, WA). Cultures showing CPE were frozen, clarified by centrifugation (1000 \u00d7 \ng), and supernatant saved as virus isolate. With no CPE observed, cells were subcultured by trypsinization for second 6-day passage, then tested for BVDV before reported as negative. Also, inoculums were tested at Oklahoma State University with MDBK observed for CPE and tested for BVDV by gel-based PCR (G-PCR) [6], [15], [16], [17], Inoculums were tested for BoCV using human rectal tumor cell monolayers [3], [4] with cultures observed 6 days. Cultures were, regardless of presence/absence of CPE tested by G-PCR [3], [4], [6]. Only the initial HRT monolayer passage was used in the study.",

[29] In North America CP strains in MLV BVDV vaccines include BVDV1a-NADL, BVDV1a-C24V, BVDV1a-NADL, BVDV2a-296c, BVDV2a-5912, BVDV2a-53637, BVDV2a-125A [29]. BoHV-1 culture isolates were analyzed by whole genome sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphisms and sequencing of PCR products using different PCR primers. [19], [20], [30]. BoHV-1 testing identifies vaccine strains and distinguishes them from field strains. PI3V testing used near complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis [31]. In U.S., PI3V vaccine strains contain PI3VA genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of BoCV sequences was based on a section of the S gene protein gene. BoCV clades in the U.S. include BoCV1, 2, and 3 [4].",

Ct values for each q-PCR or qRT-PCR positive animal are listed for BoHV-1, BVDV, BoCV, and BRSV. The vaccine/field status is listed. For BVDV, those positive for MLV virus have the subgenotype listed. Similarly most of this information is listed for the necropsy cases along with histopathology in Table 5. Of the 114 nasal swabs and if an animal was positive by at least one test for each virus, 87/114 (76.3%) were positive for any of the targeted viruses (48/49 in Group 1, 21/29 in Group 2, 18/26 in Group 3; total 87/114). All seven necropsy cases had a virus positive test. Using positive results for each type of test and regardless of virus each test detected positives on the 114 nasal swabs: (1) G-PCR (5 viruses), 44/114 (38.6%), q-PCR and qRT-PCR (4 viruses), 81/114 (71.6%), and culture (in MDBK and HRT monolayers), 40/114 (35.1%).

There were numerous cases where samples were positive for only one or two tests and negative for the other(s). Potential factors for the differences of identification include: PCR tests detect both viral nucleic acids and infectious virus while viral culture requires more infectious virus than PCR [32]. Additional factors might include individual laboratory testing and interpretation of test results. In this study, three different laboratories performed these three tests. Methods of nucleic acid extraction may vary as well and the potential interference by inhibitors of the PCR tests. An example of the differences in the identification of virus is in this study: 74/121 (61.2%) positive for BoCV by the qRT-PCR, 30/121 (24.8%) by G-PCR, and only 21/121 (17.4%) by viral culture. Of the 74 BoCV positives by qRT-PCR, there were 19 positive by viral culture and 30 positive by G-PCR. The real time PCR testing is a quantitative tests based on CT values and appears more sensitive than the G-PCR. Also the BoCV viral culture only used one passage in culture before testing and more passages may have found more virus positives. Also the level of virus in the nasal swabs for BoCV may not have been high enough for viral culture replication.",

However, clinicians seek information on the etiologies of various clinical forms, thus there is greater use of the molecular testing. The multiplex PCR tests offer considerable opportunity for virus identification. These molecular tests detect both infectious virus and viral nucleic acids. Realistically, positive test results give an indication of the presence of the virus, especially on a herd basis. However, there are shortcomings of tests that do not separate vaccine from field strains such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent antibody on necropsy tissues and the molecular and even viral culture positives, the reports only indicate the etiological agent without a distinction of field or vaccine strain designation. A recent publication on the traditional and contemporary tests for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) stated that addition to PCR testing, it is important to perform virus isolation during outbreaks of disease and archive EHV-1 strains for respective molecular characterization and molecular epidemiological investigations [32]. Practically speaking for diagnostic laboratories, should there be evidence of potential legal action regarding the source of infection, saving tissues positive by molecular tests could be archived. Should the requesting clinician or animal owner desire further separation of positives into vaccine or field strains, reference laboratories with more genomic sequencing capabilities might be used for this testing, although there is likely a cost factor.",

This should alert the clinician that infectious agents are present, and continual monitoring should include the submission of samples from animals dying of disease, especially those dying of acute disease with clinical signs.",

A somewhat divergent view is expressed in the discussion of virus culture negative/PCR positive results in a feline respiratory infection study [34].

Thus, selection of the test available may depend on the question being asked, to detect evidence of infection by viral nucleic acid or is recovery of infectious virus more important. Real time-PCR tests, especially multiplex, offers more rapid testing and the Ct values calculated for negative/positive test results. Gel based PCR relies on the subjective visualization of the gel for positive status. In this study, the q-PCR and qRT-PCR detected more viral positive, 71.6%, than the G-PCR, 38.6% or culture. 35.1%. However, there were multiple instances that G-PCR or real time-PCR negative cases had culture positives for BoHV-1, BVDV, BoCV, or PI3V.

MLV strains may replicate in the host. Replicating viruses have potential to spread within the host as evidenced by BVDV and BoHV-1 in certain vaccines to cross the placenta resulting in fetal infections [1]. Prior studies have reported several different BoHV-1 MLV vaccine strains in respiratory tract samples from BRD cases [20], [30]. BVDV vaccine strains were cultured from lungs of cattle dying in feedlots [6]. In other species, the effects of vaccination on viral detection have been varied. In the review of the EHV-1 cited prior, the authors reported that specific studies had not been conducted to determine if the MLV vaccine strain of EHV-1 is detectable in nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs following vaccination [33]. However, a reference was cited where the MLV vaccine strain has been identified in aborted fetuses [35] There has not been exhaustive studies taking samples up to days after vaccination for the parenteral administered MLV vaccines. One study administered a MLV vaccine containing BoHV1, BVDV1a and BVDV2a to seronegative calves. Unvaccinated control calves (in a separate pen) were included along with pregnant cows housed with vaccinates [36]. Nasal swabs and peripheral blood was collected through day 42. The nasal swabs and blood were tested using virus culture in bovine monolayers and a gel-based PCR test. Serums of vaccinates and controls were tested for viral antibodies to BoHV1, BVDV1, and BVDV2. All nasal swabs were negative for BoHV1 and BVDV in all collections. The buffy coat samples of vaccinates were negative except for 9/18 vaccinates BVDV positive on day 7 or 10 only while all other collections were negative. All blood samples were negative for BoHV1. All nasal swab collections were negative by gel-based PCR for BoHV1 and BVDV. There were PCR positives in blood samples 14/18 vaccinates for BVDV at days 3, 7, or 10 after vaccination. Control calves and contacts were negative by virus isolation and PCR in all collections. The control calves and contacts with vaccinates remained seronegative though out the study. While a transient viremia (cell culture positive) and blood positive by PCR occurred after vaccination, there was no evidence of viral shedding [36]. If virus is found in MLV vaccinates, the detection of MLV strains in calves\u2019 nasal secretions receiving parenteral vaccines by label route does not mean calves are capable of infecting other animals. Nasal swabs had recovered infectious viruses using qualitative tests that did not quantitate the virus amount. There is likely a quantitative threshold of virus required in nasal secretions to infect other animals.",
