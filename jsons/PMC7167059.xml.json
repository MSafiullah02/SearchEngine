            "text": "Emerging and reemerging viruses pose severe global health concerns. The four influenza pandemics in last 100 years are the examples of how these viruses impact humans. Avian influenza viruses pose significant threats to animal and human health. They are a source of genetic diversity that permits the emergence of pandemic influenza by means of genetic reassortment with prevailing human influenza viruses. A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease outbreaks in poultry in China and seven other east Asian countries after 2003 [Guan et al., 2004]. The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa underscores the unpreparedness of humans dealing with such deadly virus. EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) belong to the filovirus family Filoviradae and can cause a rapidly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. Since 1967, both outbreaks of EBOV and MARV occurred repeatedly and unpredictedly, with new strains showing high mortality rates [Towner et al., 2006]. Lassa virus, a member of the arenaviridae family, represent two important etiological agents of viral hemorrhagic fevers [Nichol et al., 2000]. Since clinically approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines against these viruses are limited, there is an urgent need to discover and develop antivirals, either targeting one particular virus or broadly targeting multiple viruses. Traditional Chinese medicine has been playing an important role in human healthcare in China and Asia for thousands of years, and now it is also a valuable source for new drug discovery in modern medicine. As our knowledge on the therapeutic benefits of these Chinese medicines increases, research efforts on the previously serendipitous treatments to discover new medicines are greatly intensified. Natural products including Chinese medicines have been and continue to be a rich source for new drug discover [Newman and Cragg, 2007] since they have a large structural diversity and complexity that remains unmatched by other drug formats [Rosen et al., 2009]. Artemisinin, also known as Qing Hao Su in Chinese which was originally isolated from the plant Artemisia annua L, and its semi\u2010synthetic derivatives are a group of drugs that possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against Plasmodium falciparum malaria [White, 1997], are an illustrious example of how new antimicrobial drugs can be discovered from Chinese Medicine herbs. Tetrandrine, which was isolated and identified as an active ingredient in a Chinese medicinal herb, Stephaniae Tetrandrae Radix, was reported to inhibit EBOV infection both in vitro and in vivo [Sakurai et al., 2015]. Also anti\u2010influenza drug discovery efforts on natural products have seen a rapid increase in the recent years [Wang et al., 2006].",

For this experiment, we selected Prunella vulgaris L. with the highest SI (more than 124), which was tested at various time points along with azidothymidine (AZT), and PBS as controls. Briefly, cells were incubated with Ebola pseudovirus for one hour at 4\u00b0C to allow viral attachment to cells. Virus was washed from cells and the temperature was shifted 37\u00b0C to trigger virus entry. Extracts and controls were added to the wells at various time points (\u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hr). As shown in Figure 5, AZT works post\u2010fusion on the reverse transcriptase of HIV, it still has inhibitory effects at the later time points (>4 hr). Extract of Prunella vulgaris L., showed inhibition during early time points (\u22121, 0, and 1 hr). This suggests that this extract is working at the early attachment step of filoviral entry. The remainder of the extract exhibited their inhibitory effects at a earlier than AZT. This suggests that this extract is working at a post\u2010attachment step, but prior to the membrane fusion step.",

This strategy is particularly useful for highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola virus, avian influenza virus H5N1, and Lassa virus, since the HIV vector\u2010based surrogate system allows us to perform high throughput screens in the biosafety level 2 (BSL\u20102) containment instead of the BSL\u20103 or BSL\u20104 for the infectious viruses with alleviated safety concerns. Using several viruses screen simultaneously or sequentially, it can easily identify putative entry inhibitors for different viruses and reduce the number of the false\u2010positive hits (see Table I).",

            "text": "Traditional Chinese medicine holds a unique position among all traditional medicines because of its long history in China. Many extracts of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have been proven to have antiviral activities [Jassim and Naji, 2003]. Most of these are generally of low toxicity, cheap, and readily accessible. By using this pseudovirions entry system, we have tested more than four hundreds Chinese herb extracts and show that extracts of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, Citrus aurantium L., Viola yedoensis Makino, Prunella vulgaris L., Coix lacryma\u2010jobi L. var. mayuen (Roman.) Stapf, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit., and Morus alba L. all exhibited potent inhibitory activity against EBOV glycoprotein entry out of all the extracts tested (Table II). Some previous reports have showed that Citrus aurantium L. displays anti\u2010HCV activity [Ho et al., 2003], the extract of Viola yedoensis Makino has high inhibitory activity toward HIV\u20101 [Ngan et al., 1988] and RSV [Ma et al., 2002] in vitro, the extract of Prunella vulgaris L. has specific activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) [Xu et al., 1999] and HIV\u20101 [Yao et al., 1992], Morus alba L. showed some activity against Herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV\u20101) [Du et al., 2003], HIV, influenza virus and HBV [Geng et al., 2012]. Here we demonstrate that extracts of Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. display potential inhibitory activity against EBOV\u2010GP entry. These Chinese medicinal herbs merit further investigation as a promising antiviral due to its rich source, low costs, low cytotoxicity, wide acceptability, and strong antiviral properties. The possible mechanism of action of these drugs in inhibiting EBOV entry remains unknown, and further detailed chemical research to identify and purify the active ingredient(s) will facilitate its mechanistic analyses and applications.",

The identification of one extract of Prunella vulgaris L. [Zhang et al., 2016] previously known to inhibit Ebola virus entry in our repurposing screen further supports the usefulness of our approach. We also detected that Prunella vulgaris L. could block the early attachment step of Ebola entry with time of addition experiment. We hope that our screening efforts will result in the identification of novel herbal extracts for the development of drugs to treat Ebola virus infections or other highly pathogenic viruses.
