Most other AEFIs are only coincidental after immunization and are acausal; however, because of the temporal association, the general public may believe that a certain event is causally related. In clinical trials before licensing, every event post-vaccination is recorded (including traffic accidents), and an investigation is done if an event is considered to be causal. Such a procedure is not possible in normal life but in the population risk assessment underestimates the benefit of vaccination and overestimates the risk of immunization.",

The study suggested that children who had the MMR vaccination were more likely to develop behavioral disorders including autism. The trial included 12 children (11 boys, 1 girl), in the age range 3\u201310 years. All children underwent a series of medical assessments. From a scientific point of view the study was not of high quality. There was no control group and the cohort was too small to show a significant outcome. Despite that, the paper was published in The Lancet. In 2004 The Sunday Times revealed evidence that a solicitor sponsored Wakefield to find a link between vaccines and autism [23]. This caused the retraction of the publication in 2010 and all co-authors except Wakefield resigned their support from the trial\u2019s interpretation [24]. Wakefield\u2019s medical license was removed [25]. He is currently living in the USA and still canvassing his anti-vaccine beliefs. One of those arguing that vaccination causes autism was President Trump (USA), who tweeted on 28 March 2014: healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn\u2019t feel good and changes\u2014AUTISM. Many such cases! The American Academy of Pediatrics responded to this in a letter signed by 350 scientific organizations.

            "text": "Another assertion of vaccine opponents is that the reason for the decreasing number of infections was not caused by introducing new vaccines, instead it was because of better hygiene and nutrition [34, 35]. There was a great improvement in quality of hygiene and nutrition in the last century. To understand the correlation between these two parameters and their impact on human lives it is best to look at life expectancy. Life expectancy shows a steady, linear gain. In the year 1880 it was below 40 years and in 2015 it was twice as high [36]. The numbers of reported measles cases however decreased exponentially after the nationwide introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963 [37\u201339]. In the 1920s, approximately 3% of a birth cohort died of measles in early life [33]. The same decrease happened with poliomyelitis. In the 1950s, two polio vaccines were developed and came on the market. Jonas Salk developed a vaccine that protected the central nervous system and a few years later Albert Sabin introduced an oral live vaccine which also prevented transmission and infection through the digestive system. Over 350,000 paralytic poliomyelitis cases were estimated globally in 1980. In 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was founded, resulting in a further decrease of paralytic polio, with 42 cases world-wide in 2016 [40]. In 2019 only two countries reported polio cases (Pakistan, Afghanistan). The switch from endemic early asymptomatic polio infection to epidemic outbreaks of polio can also be explained by better hygiene. In the nineteenth century hygiene standards were far lower and children were exposed to the polio virus very early in life while still having a passive immunization through their mother. Later, in the twentieth century, the infection developed at a later point in life without protection of passive antibodies, causing epidemic outbreaks. After establishing a nationwide vaccination program in the USA, the numbers of poliomyelitis cases dropped from 57,879 in 1952 to 910 in 1962. Herd immunity was reached due to high coverage and The Americas were declared free of polio in 1994 [41].",

Measles has the following complications: otitis media, pneumonia, postinfectious encephalomyelitis, SSPE and sustainable immunosuppression [42, 43]. The mortality of measles nowadays is 1 in 1000 cases in industrialized countries. The two most severe complications are SSPE and sustainable immunosuppression. SSPE has an incidence of 1 in 5000\u201310,000 but is even more common when infection occurs in the first year of life (1:600). The reason why SSPE is a dangerous complication is because there is no cure and it will inevitably lead to death. Herd immunity is necessary to protect from SSPE. When measles was eliminated from the USA, SSPE decreased to zero for children born in the USA.",

In contrast, to avoid one fatality from cervical cancer, only 101 girls (aged 9\u201314 years) need to be immunized with HPV vaccines. Assuming tender prices of 55 \u20ac/dose and a two-dose regimen, costs are less than 11,100 \u20ac to avoid one female death caused by HPV [53]; however, in Austria the recommendation is to immunize boys and girls: a whole birth cohort (n ~ 80,000) has therefore to be vaccinated with costs of about 8,800,000 \u20ac to reach the prevention optimum, including genital warts and male cancer. About 300 women die each year from cervical cancer [54], so one can make a rough estimate of vaccine costs of 30,000 \u20ac to prevent one woman\u2019s death from oncogenic HPV. Hence this is significantly cheaper than costs of death prevention in road traffic accidents.",

            "text": "The principle of so-called herd immunity or population immunity is the evidence-based rebuttal of this argument. Herd immunity is an indirect effect of vaccination and is defined as the indirect protection of unvaccinated people. An increasing number of vaccinated individuals in a population leads to reduced pathogen spreading and therefore to an interruption of the natural chain of infection. Herd immunity and its importance was first noticed with smallpox. The goal was to immunize 80% of the population in order to achieve herd immunity. The eradication of smallpox in 1977 and the declaration by the WHO in May 1980 that \u201cthe world and all its peoples have won freedom from smallpox\u201d, was the result of even higher vaccine uptake rates and led to the reduction of smallpox by a mass vaccination program in endemic countries [55]. In a population, immunity can be achieved in two different ways: vaccination or infection. Considering two different subpopulations, the immunized population has to be larger than the one with susceptible individuals. The number of susceptible hosts has to be reduced to a level that interrupts transmission of the pathogen. The necessary vaccine coverage to achieve herd immunity is pathogen-dependent [56]. This is particularly important for individuals who cannot receive any vaccination, such as newborns, immunosuppressed children, or immunologically na\u00efve persons, who all profit from the indirect protection of herd immunity [57]. For example, an unvaccinated woman can profit from the HPV vaccination of her male partners since the high-risk HPV strains 16 and 18 are responsible for 70\u201380% of cervical cancers.",

During development of a new vaccine, preclinical tests have to be carried out. The preclinical phase consists of testing, determining and specifying the antigen as well as selecting the adjuvants and performing in vitro [60, 61], in silico [62] and in vivo [59] experiments. The preclinical phase, which is subjected to constant ameliorations and updates [63], demands years of research [62]. If this phase is successful, clinical studies must be performed (phases I\u2013III) including up to 60,000 volunteers.

A prominent example of a human-specific pathogen is the measles virus. Since the measles virus exhibits a high rate of replication [77] and is highly contagious [79, 82], an especially high vaccination coverage is required to regionally eliminate and later eradicate the disease [83]. According to the WHO, 95% of the non-immune population needs to be vaccinated twice against measles to completely stop it from spreading [78]; however, eliminating the virus in just one country and subsequently pausing the vaccination program will not suffice since it would just need one contagious person visiting from a country where the virus has not been eliminated to set off the next measles outbreak if the person was in contact with an unvaccinated individual. To effectively eradicate a human-specific pathogen like the measles virus, worldwide cooperation is needed. Lastly, another obvious yet decisive aspect of vaccinating against diseases like the measles virus is reducing the chance of contracting the disease and any of its entailing complications and keeping secondary risks to a minimum [77]. Thus, vaccinating as many individuals as possible, given that there are no contraindications, maximizes the chances of pathogen eradication and, subsequently nullifies the need for vaccinating against the pathogen in question, as well as minimizing the risks of catching serious vaccine-preventable diseases.",
