            "text": "Among many pathogens causing diarrhoea in suckling piglets coccidian infections, and Isospora suis invasion in particular, play a leading role. Piglets with clinical coccidiosis (isosporosis) presented with diarrhoea, which most frequently occurs in the second week of life, excrete a watery or pasty yellowish faeces. In piglets clinical signs result from the destructive action of coccidian endogenous developmental stages on the intestinal mucosa. Mortality due to isosporosis is at a low or even moderate level. The greatest economical losses caused by isosporosis are connected with a reduction in weight gains of infected piglets (Mundt et al., 2006, Niestrath et al., 2002). I. suis has been detected in piglets all over the world (Driesen et al., 1993, Meyer et al., 1999, Sayd and Kawazoe, 1996). Some investigations demonstrate the significant role of this parasite as a pathogen causing diarrhoea in suckling piglets. In Australia, for example, I. suis oocysts were found in more than a half of the examined diarrhoeal piglets, whilst Escherichia coli and rotavirus were isolated only in 17 and 18% of these piglets respectively (Driesen et al., 1993). Similar results were obtained in Germany where in 2 and 3-week-old diarrhoeal piglets I. suis was the most prevalent pathogen (32\u201340%), whereas E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus infections were found in relatively low percentages (2\u20139%) (Wieler et al., 2001).",

Overall, 780 litters of suckling piglets from 104 farms and 267 mother sows were examined. The Iinvestigation was conducted on three types of farms: 63 large farms (>100 sows), 30 medium farms (25\u2013100 sows) and 11 small farms (<25 sows). The examined swine groups were comprised of: 571 litters and 159 sows from large farms, 171 litters and 98 sows from medium sized farms, and 38 litters and 10 sows from small farms. Faecal samples of 5 to 28-day-old piglets were collected directly from the rectum. Samples were taken from 3 to 5 piglets per litter and pooled. 5\u201310% of litters from each farm were investigated. In addition a faecal samples was collected from the mother sows directly from the rectum, or from the floor directly after defecation. The faeces were analyzed with the McMaster method in Raynaud modification and the OPG value (number of oocysts per gram of faeces) was estimated according to this method (Raynaud, 1970). The saturated NaCl solution sugar enriched (1 litre of saturated NaCl + 500 g sugar) was used at room temperature (specific gravity 1.3). The enrichment of flotation solution with sugar improved the microscopic examination of the samples of fatty faeces of suckling piglets. The samples were examined at 100\u00d7 magnification and in questionable cases at 400\u00d7 magnification. Samples with unsporulated oocysts were mixed with 2.5% potassium dichromate solution and stored on Petri dishes at 25 \u00b0C in order to induce the sporulation. The species of coccidia were defined based on oocysts morphology and sporulation time.",

I. suis oocysts in piglets faeces were detected in many European countries (Farkas et al., 2004, Koudela and Vitovec, 1986, Mundt et al., 2005). Similar results were obtained in our investigations carried out in Poland, where I. suis oocysts were reported on 67% of the farms. In our study Eimeria spp. infection in piglets, like in other investigations (Niestrath et al., 2002), were uncommon. Considerably lower percentages of suckling piglets infected with Eimeria spp. in comparison to I. suis, is probably due to some differences in the development cycles of these two types of coccidia. Namely, in the environment, the time period needed for I. suis oocysts to become infective (the sporulation time) is very short (about 24\u201348 h) while Eimeria spp. oocysts need 5\u201312 days (depending on the species) to sporulate. Moreover, a microclimate in farrowing pens (high temperature \u2013 about 30 \u00b0C) can shorten the sporulation time of I. suis oocysts to a mere 12 h whereas, according to other authors (Lindsay et al., 1984), these conditions may hinder the sporulation of Eimeria spp. oocysts. This situation enables a quick spreading of the I. suis infection among piglets before their immunity reaches an adequate level (Koudela and Kucerova, 2000).",

Hence, in our investigation I. suis invasion was more often reported on the large commercial farms, whereas Eimeria spp. on the smaller farms. Bad hygienic conditions and suboptimal temperatures in piglet pens, is often observed on small individual swine farms, which in turn favours the occurrence of Eimeria spp. infections. The occurrence of Eimeria spp. in pigs is considered by some authors as the indicator for the hygienic status of a farm \u2013 the lower the level of hygiene is, the more frequently Eimeria spp. infections occur. However, such conditions observed on the smaller farms (appropriate for Eimeria spp.), as it was shown in our investigation, are unfavourable for I. suis, which on this type of farms were rarely found. Similar results confirming a more frequent occurrence of I. suis on larger farms than those of the smaller ones were obtained in Nordic countries (Larsen, 1996). In this study in herds comprising of less than 50 sows I. suis oocysts were only found in 7% suckling piglets, in herds with 50\u2013100 sows \u2013 in 22%, and in herds with more than 100 sows \u2013 34% piglets.",

It should be stressed that the lower percentages for sows shedding Eimeria spp. oocysts reported in our investigation might result from the fact that only lactating sows were examined.

However, the existence of extraintestinal developmental stages of I. suis and related alternative routes of infection, is still questionable and left unanswered. The morphology of I. suis oocysts (particularly a lack of Stieda bodies in sporocysts), suggests the occurrence of such stages in the I. suis life cycle. Similar oocysts morphology is characteristic for the group of coccidia of Isospora genus (e.g. the species occurring in dogs and cats), all of which produce tissue stages. Some trials were carried out in order to demonstrate I. suis extraintestinal stages but they failed to yield positive results (Pinckney et al., 1993, Stuart et al., 1982).",
