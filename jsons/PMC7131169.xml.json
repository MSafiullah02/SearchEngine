By 1894, animal derived anti-diphtheria serum was used in humans during a European epidemic [2]; concurrently, Phisalex and Bertrand demonstrated that the blood of horses immunised with Viper aspis (the European viper) had antivenin properties [3]. Sera from both humans and animals were subsequently used for management of illness caused by viruses such as measles, varicella and the pandemic Spanish influenza of 1918 [4], [5]. Anti-rabies polyclonal antibody preparations from hyper-immunised horses were developed in the early 20th century [6]. In this pre-antibiotic era, serum therapy was also applied to bacterial infections such as pneumococcal pneumonia, meningococcal meningitis and streptococcal scarlet fever [7], [8].",

Antibiotics against bacterial infections largely superseded serum therapy in the late 1930s and 1940s [7].

The humanisation of mAbs allowed their use in the treatment of chronic disease by repeated administration. However, polyclonal antibodies still proved more effective than monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of many infectious diseases. To date, most monoclonal antibody therapies are produced for either autoimmune conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Crohns disease) or neoplastic conditions. The only licenced monoclonal antibody to an infectious target is palivizumab, for RSV [9]. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal therapy, by targeting multiple epitopes, can protect against epitope mutation [4]. Additionally, more may be needed of a low avidity monoclonal antibody preparation, compared with a polyclonal preparation, to neutralise a given amount of toxin or pathogen, as is generally the case for antitoxins to snake envenomation [10].",

            "text": "Adverse reactions in humans to animal-derived polyclonal antibodies are usually due to the presence of highly immunogenic animal proteins. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, begin within minutes. Type 3 hypersensitivity, or serum-sickness, results from deposition of immune complexes on small vessels of the skin, joints and kidneys; this can develop at any point over the three weeks it takes to clear the injected antibodies [3]. Antibodies consist of the antigen binding (Fab) fractions, linked by disulphide bonds as F(ab\u2032)2, and the crystallisable fraction (Fc). The reactogenic Fc fragment can induce complement-mediated urticaria, angioedema, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and nephropathy [3]. Fc removal with retention of the immunogenic F(ab)/F(ab\u2032)2 components was first applied to digoxin antiserum in 1976 [16]. The F(ab)/F(ab\u2032)2 fragments were isolated initially through salt precipitation and subsequently, since the mid-1990s, via chromatographic purification [17]. Complement mediated anyphylactoid reactions, fever and hypersensitivity have been reduced by careful elimination from the final product of bacterial endotoxins (pyrogens) as well as protein and cell aggregates, through pasteurisation, ultrafiltration and additional chromatography [18]. With this combination of purity and safety advancements, serious adverse events are now rare, even very rare. With equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG), anaphylactic shock is reported in less than 1/45, 000 treatments, serum sickness in <0.5% and all-grade adverse events in <5% [3], [15].",

Enzymatic cleavage or digestion by low pH pepsin of IgG to Fc and active F(ab\u2032) or F(ab\u2032)2 regions reduces adverse reactions [17]. A second anion-exchange chromatography excludes the Fc fragments, protein and cell aggregates which result from low pH pepsin digestion, as well as bacterial pyrogens [22]. European guidelines require animal immunosera that are test-negative for pyrogens [23]. A final pasteurisation step involves heat-treatment for 10 h at 60 \u00b0C, which destroys viruses, and thermocoagulates excess proteins [20]. High performance liquid chromatography is used to control purity of the final product; usually 90% of the content is covalent F(ab\u2032)2, 5% F(ab) fragments, and <0.5% are polymers/aggregates [18]. Importantly, immunoreactivity remains intact after these steps [19]. The final antiviral antibody titre is determined for example by ELISA or seroneutralisation assays for antiviral immunoglobulins. Variations in the production process include application of potassium sulphate for F(ab\u2032)2-Fc separation, and precipitation of non-immunoglobulin proteins, caprylic acid precipitation to purify whole IgG (resulting in near total exclusion of albumin, less activation of complement as well as lower total protein/protein aggregates compared to ammonium sulphate precipitation), and centrifugation to eliminate cellular elements and proteins [3], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Preservatives are added to the final products to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination [28]. Refrigeration and avoidance of prolonged storage avoids protein/cell reaggregation and precipitation [28].",

Both IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 fragment elimination occurs mainly by formation and elimination of immune complexes (catabolism), whereas F(ab\u2032) is cleared renally [33]. The longer half-life means that antivenins made from IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 persist, which reduces rebound symptoms of envenomation associated with F(ab\u2032) antitoxins [34]. Additionally, the preservation of large Mr antivenins in the vascular compartment draws venin out of tissues into the bloodstream to form antivenin-venom complexes, promoting venom clearance [35]. However, recent human pharmacokinetic data suggests that F(ab\u2032)2 also extravasates into tissues [36], [37].

The plasmatic elimination of F(ab\u2032)2 after one IV infusion had a mean t1/2 of 16.77 h and after 5 infusions 24 h apart, a mean of 10.89 h.

After the fifth infusion, equine F(ab\u2032)2 remained detectable by ELISA in plasma, (above > 1 \u03bcg/mL) for between 3 to 14 days. These results were consistent with another human study of intravenous equine F(ab\u2032)2, with a plasma t1/2 of 14.2 h and a later catabolism of F(ab\u2032)2 with a t1/2 of around 7 days[37].

Both initial measures (e.g. donor selection, epidemiological exclusion, quarantine, health status of the animal) and processing of final product reduce the risk of a contaminating virus. Animals are contained within closed flocks or maintained in areas free of insect vectors of certain arboviruses. For example, rattlesnake, viper and digoxin antitoxins are manufactured in South Australia, a region free of prions and many viral pathogens [46]. Source animals may also be vaccinated against local pathogens such as rabies, anthrax and viral equine encephalitides [31]. Molecular diagnostic screening of animals for viruses may be performed [29], [31]. Record-keeping and regular stock inspections contribute to quality control [4]. The rigor of the application of such processes varies by resource availability e.g. in resource-challenged countries where much of the world's antivenin/antitoxin is both required and produced, not all safety measures may be employed [15], [47]. Polyvalent (source animal immunised with more than one venin) polyclonal antivenins have higher rates of adverse reactions than monovalent (source animal immunised to just one venin) polyclonal antivenins, e.g. 24% vs. 9% for Australian produced CSL snake antivenins, due in part to the larger volumes required to be administered for treatment with the polyvalent rather than monovalent polyclonal antibodies [48].",

A 10-year retrospective chart review revealed the fractionated Crotalidae polyvalent immune F(ab\u2032) (CroFab\u00ae\n) to be more effective at avoiding fasciotomies than the whole IgG product ACP[64]. A 12 year review of CroFab\u00ae revealed a response rate of 77% amongst 24 cases of severe envenomation, including neurotoxicity, whilst in another series of 28 severe envenomations, all responded to CroFab\u00ae\n[65], [66]. A literature review of controlled and observational studies confirmed the efficacy and safety of CroFab\u00ae\n[67]. Crofab\u00ae has also been demonstrated to be effective in paediatric patients [68], [69]. However, a South American study demonstrated a locally produced whole IgG antivenin was more effective than two F(ab\u2032)2 preparations but with more anaphylactoid reactions [70]. Amongst the fractionated products, a comparison of F(ab\u2032) and F(ab\u2032)2 rattlesnake antivenin demonstrated a significant reduction in late coagulopathy in those who received F(ab\u2032)2 compared to F(ab\u2032) (29.7% vs. 10.3%) due to the longer half-life of the divalent over the monovalent product [34]. This advantage of F(ab\u2032)2 over F(ab\u2032) has been demonstrated for other antivenins [71], [72].",

Whole IgG rattlesnake antivenin (e.g. Antivenin Crotalidae Polyvalent ACP) was associated with a 18\u201350% frequency of immediate and delayed reactions [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. This was more than halved after the removal of Fc and implantation of modern purification methods (e.g. Crofab\u00ae) [63], [67], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [65], [94]. A meta-analysis of CroFab\u00ae revealed an immediate hypersensitivity rate of 8% and serum sickness of 13%[95], with even lower rates reported in a subsequent study of 340 cases: <2% immediate hypersensitivity reactions and 5% serum sickness [96]. Likewise, the adverse event rate of bothrops antivenin improved from 25 to 82% for ammonium sulphate precipitated whole IgG preparations to 11\u201328% for caprylic acid precipitated whole IgG and 12\u201336% for F(ab\u2032)2 antivenin [26], [28].",

A simple linear weighting by the sample size of each study was applied. The weighted mean and standard deviation for each set of studies were compared using a formula to isolate the effect of the independent variable (the anti-venin) given to an otherwise similar population distribution. We determined an estimate of the percentage difference with z\n = 1.96 to give 95% confidence intervals, which are reported below. This analysis demonstrates that F(ab\u2032) and F(ab\u2032)2 are safer than whole IgG and that there was a reduction in adverse events after introduction of purification techniques in the mid-1990s, with the exception of no reduction in anaphylaxis pre and post 1995 for all types of antivenins, combined.",

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of anti-scorpion F(ab\u2032)2 in Arizona revealed a significant difference in the following: rapid symptom resolution, midazolam requirement and plasma venom levels, compared to placebo [117]. A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs and 5 observational studies demonstrated effectiveness in new world (American) scorpion envenomations but not in the old world[118]. Adverse events were higher in non-randomised trials, e.g. serum sickness occurred in 57% of those treated in one study, but lasted only 3 days, and antivenin was highly effective, reducing symptom duration from 22 h to 31 min [119]. Adverse events were infrequent in the RCTs (0\u20132%). However, this meta-analysis included a 2011 Indian (\u2018old world\u2019) controlled trial where scorpion F(ab\u2032)2 antivenin reversed clinical envenomation more effectively than no antivenin [120]. Three other old-world studies not included in the meta-analysis have demonstrated efficacy. An uncontrolled Indian study of scorpion F(ab\u2032)2 antivenin where 41/48 (85.4%) responded, with one mild reaction[121]; a prospective case-control series from India of 62 patients under the age of 18 years which demonstrated that dopamine and dobutamine requirement was reduced and recovery was faster in those who received scorpion antivenin [122] and a controlled trial from Saudi Arabia that reported a reduction in mortality from 4\u20138% to <0.05%, with mild reactions only (13.9%) [123]. In a review of 10 studies, only this Indian uncontrolled trial of scorpion F(ab\u2032)2 antivenin revealed efficacy, as opposed to whole IgG in all the other trials [124]\n. However, withdrawal of IgG scorpion antisera in the USA in 2002 with no alternative substituted, resulted in a 5-fold increase in ICU admissions for stings [125]. Saudi Arabian data demonstrated a reduction in deaths from 1.7% to nil, in pulmonary oedema from 11.1% to 1.2% and in cardiac arrest from 7.4% to 0.4% after introduction of scorpion antivenin in 1991 [126].",

A review of whole IgG funnel-web spider antivenin use in Australia reported a complete response in 97% of 75 recipients, with only one local reaction, one case of anaphylaxis and one case of serum sickness [127]. Whole IgG black widow spider (lactodectrus) antivenin reduced durations of symptom and hospitalisation in moderate to severe envenomation in a US review [128], [129]. Intravenous (as compared to intramuscular) administration was associated with high rates of anaphylaxis (e.g. 9% in 1989) and serum sickness (33%) prior to reducing the speed of administration, which reduced the total adverse event rate to less than 3% [130]. Equine derived F(ab\u2032)2 black widow antivenins have been developed and are being tested [131]. An Australian study of 95 cases of redback spider antivenin F(ab\u2032)2 yielded 4 cases of anaphylaxis (4.2%) and a serum sickness rate of 9.3% [132]. Overall, polyclonal antibodies used as antidotes are also reportedly safe. A study of 717 patients who received anti-digoxin F(ab\u2032) revealed an allergy rate of 0.8% [133].",

All cases have been in Africa, Asia or the Middle East, or travellers returning [142]. Survivors produce demonstrable neutralising antibodies [143].

Sero-neutralising assays and haemagglutination inhibition tests confirmed the potent neutralising abilities of equine polyclonal anti-HPAI H5N1 F(ab\u2032)2 preparations in mice[145]. In another study, four H5N1 avian influenza equine F(ab\u2032)2 preparations demonstrated cytopathic effect against cultured Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with H5N1 and protected mice against lethal challenge, both given prior (prophylaxis) or post (therapeutic) exposure [146]. These studies concur with earlier mice studies of polyclonal antibodies to seasonal influenza A. In one such study, mice were immunised with the M2 antigen of influenza A, anti-influenza IgG was obtained and intravenously injected into other exposed mice leading to 100% survival with high dose (320 micrograms) IgG [147].",

MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory illness and, sometimes, renal injury [133], [159]. Whilst most cases have occurred in several Middle Eastern countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, cases have been reported from Korea, Europe and North Africa [160], [161] Of the 1368 reported cases of Mers-CoV to WHO by 7 July 2015, 487 have died (35.6%); but a large proportion of cases may go undiagnosed [162]. There appear to be a mix of zoonotic (bat and/or camel) and human sources for transmission; person-to-person transmission has been particularly documented in health-care settings [162], [163], [164]. There is neither a specific treatment nor a licenced vaccine. In a recent study, serum of Egyptian dromedary camels who were seropositive for Mers-CoV was administered to mice infected with Mers-CoV, with Australian camel sero-negative sera serving as a control [165]. Mers-CoV seropositive camel serum given both pre- and post-exposure protected infected mice from weight loss, diminished lung histological changes and accelerated virus clearance. Polyclonal antibodies could provide post-exposure prophylaxis for close contacts as well as a therapeutic strategy for those severely affected by MERS-CoV. One potential setting for the development of an epidemic of either H5N1 or MERS-CoV is the annual HAJJ pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, where preparations for a potential MERS outbreak are being refined [166].",

The safety of current products has been demonstrated in clinical trials and post marketing surveillance. When WHO guidelines are followed in administering rabies equine polyclonal antibodies, post-exposure prophylaxis is highly effective in averting rabies. Antivenins are also safe and effective for snake and arachnid bites, with available data suggesting a positive effect against scorpion bites. Antidotes are also reportedly safe and effective. Polyclonal antibodies are being developed against viruses with epidemic and pandemic potential for which prophylactic and therapeutic options are currently limited, such as avian influenza and other zoonotic viruses. Preclinical studies as well as phase 1 safety studies against avian H5N1 influenza, are promising and the technology exists to rapidly apply the methods of polyclonal production against a wide range of pathogenic antigens, providing an exciting opportunity to revolutionise the prognosis of both longstanding neglected tropical diseases as well as emerging viral threats to humans.",
