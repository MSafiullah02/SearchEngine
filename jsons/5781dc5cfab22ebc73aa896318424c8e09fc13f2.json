J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 Abstract Discovered in 2017, swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), also known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) or porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV), is the fifth porcine CoV identified in diarrheal piglets. The presumed name \"SADS-CoV\" may not be appropriate since current studies have not provided strong evidence for high pathogenicity of the virus. SeACoV was the most recently recognized CoV of potential bat origin prior to the novel human severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), associated with the pandemic CoV disease 2019 (COVID -19). Although SeACoV is recognized as a regional epizootic virus currently, it possesses the most extensive cell species tropism in vitro among known CoVs. This review summarizes the emergence of SeACoV and updates the research progress made from 2017 to early 2020, mainly focusing on the etiology, epidemiology, evolutionary perspective, potential for interspecies transmission, pathogenesis and diagnosis.",

Interestingly, SeACoV and HKU2 possess unique S genes that are closely related to the betacoronaviruses (Lau et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2017) . Most recently, Yu et al reported cryo-EM structures for HKU2 and SeACoV S protein trimers, which are available in the open access preprint repository (Yu et al., 2020) . The trimeric structures of HKU2 and SeACoV S proteins (resolutions of 2.38 \u00c5 and 2.83 \u00c5, respectively) are very similar, with differences mainly found in the N-and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, which is responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. Both the HKU2 and SeACoV S protein carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) structures have a single-layer core consisting of a twisted, five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2 sheet similar to the betacoronaviruses (Yu et al., 2020) . This suggests recombination between alphaand betacoronavirus S glycoproteins, and reflects the evolutionary origin of the HKU2/SeACoV S protein at a structural level. Although the S2 subunit (which mediates membrane fusion) is also conserved, the conformation of the region after the fusion peptide of the HKU2-CoV and SeACoV S2 subunits are different from other CoVs. These results provide structural evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between HKU2-related CoV and betacoronavirus S proteins, and provide new insights into CoV evolution and cross-species transmission (Yu et al., 2020) .",

Specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) are usually generated based on viral structural proteins, and immunofluorescence assay using pAbs against N, M and S1 proteins have been used to detect SeACoV infection in cultured cells. Anti-N and anti-M pAbs have also been used for specific detection of SeACoV infection with expected molecular size (42-and 25-KDa, respectively) by western blot (Yang et al., 2019a) or immunohistochemistry (Yang et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2018b) . In addition, rabbit antiserum against SeACoV Nsp3 acidic domain has been validated for use in the time course analysis of viral protein expression using confocal images, which detected the Nsp3 expression as early as 4 h post-infection in SeACoV-infected cells (Yang et al., 2019a) .",

Among the small intestine, the jejunum is the major target of SeACoV infection in vivo. Vero cells are routinely used for the isolation of novel CoVs; they were used to isolate SeACoV initially (Pan et al., 2017) . Virus-positive samples were inoculated and blind-passaged on Vero cell lines plus exogenous trypsin, with cytopathic effect characterized by syncytia formation (Pan et al., 2017) . A single-cycle of replication by SeACoV in Vero cells takes approximately 4-6 h (Yang et al., 2019a) . Furthermore, cell lines originating from various tissues of humans and several animal species including bats, mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, pigs, chickens and nonhuman primates, were tested for viral susceptibility and species tropism. Twenty-one of the 24 tested cell lines showed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f significant susceptibility to SeACoV infection, defined by efficient viral antigen expression and increased viral RNA titers (Yang et al., 2019b) . Notably, SeACoV infects both primary and passaged cell lines of rodent origin, suggesting that rodents may be susceptible to SeACoV infection. In most cases, exogenous trypsin enhanced the propagation of SeACoV in susceptible cell lines. HeLa cells showed the highest susceptibility based on viral load detected in culture supernatants by quantitative RT-PCR (Yang et al., 2019b) . This study revealed a remarkably broad spectrum of SeACoV tropism in vitro, and suggested exogenous trypsin treatment and endogenous protease on the cell membrane may activate the fusion of SeACoV S protein for efficient cell entry and release (Yang et al., 2019b) .",

Recently, our lab developed a DNA-launched reverse genetics system for SeACoV (the infectious clone \"pSEA\") (Yang et al., 2019a) . The full-length consensus cDNA sequence of SeACoV (27,155 nt) was assembled and inserted into a modified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) backbone plasmid that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter, a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence and terminator. In addition, two silent mutations (A24222T and G24223C) in ORF3 were introduced in pSEA as a genetic marker to differentiate the parental J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 virus. The recombinant SeACoV with the genetic marker can be recovered by direct transfection of cells with pSEA and a helper plasmid expressing the N gene, with similar growth kinetics to the parental virus (Yang et al., 2019a) . This plasmid-based system was applied to determine whether a SeACoV non-susceptible cell line, MDCK (canine kidney cells), could confer SeACoV replication competency by transfection of pSEA (Yang et al., 2019b) . By introducing desired mutations into viral structural and nonstructural genes, the SeACoV reverse genetics system will facilitate functional analysis of replication and packaging signals, and can be exploited to engineer recombinant SeACoV for design of attenuated vaccines. Most recently, a reporter virus expressing GFP by replacement of ORF3 was generated to track SeACoV in cell culture based on this system in our lab (unpublished data), which will also allow for high-throughout screening of antivirals in the future.",

In addition, SeACoV can induce apoptosis via caspase-dependent FasL and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways . These studies provide insights into the comprehensive understanding of the interactions between SeACoV and susceptible hosts. A mouse infection model has been established for SeACoV with active viral replication in splenic dendritic cells, which suggests that SeACoV may be susceptible to rodents (Yang et al., 2019b) . In this study, mice exhibited only subclinical infection, and seem to be more susceptible by the intraperitoneal route, with modest replication in intestinal tissues and titers declining around 3 days post-infection (Yang et al., 2019b) .",

Initially, it was believed that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SeACoV causes enteric disease with a mortality rate over 35% in piglets less than 10 days old (Zhou et al., 2018b) . Its clinical symptoms were similar to PEDV and TGEV, including severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b) . Although the viruses isolated from different groups were able to infect piglets by the oral route, they each caused mild or severe diarrhea symptom (Pan et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018b) . In a challenge experiment on 4-day-old piglets using a cell culture strain GDS04-P12, clinical signs developed gradually and the virus was shed in the feces throughout the experimental period (Xu et al., 2019) . All piglets (n=10) challenged with the virus died from 5 to 12 days post-infection (dpi).",

SeACoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the challenged piglets by immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathology revealed that the intestinal villi of the duodenum, jejunum, and other places had varying degrees of atrophy, and the intestinal epithelium also showed necrosis (Xu et al., 2019) . These results indicated that GDS04-P12 is highly pathogenic to the newborn piglets. A pathogenesis study J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f using the cell culture strain CN/GDWT/2017 from the group that designated the virus \"SADS-CoV\" also showed high mortality (3/6) in the inoculated 3-day-old piglets (Zhou et al., 2018b) . However, immunohistochemical analysis displayed only a few jejunal epithelial cells that were stained with viral antigen in challenged piglets, which may not be in line with the 50% mortality (Zhou et al., 2018b) . Therefore, future studies based on our recently developed SeACoV reverse genetics system are warranted to investigate this important question. We hope to reconstruct the wild-type strain from the original sample by using an infectious clone, and conduct a comparative challenge experiment to further clarify the true pathogenicity of SeACoV.",

The zoonotic potential of SeACoV was assessed in vitro, showing that SeACoV was able to grow efficiently in nine human and monkey cell lines.

After the complete genome of SeACoV was determined, multiple rapid PCR detection methods were subsequently developed (Table 1) . Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and real-time RT-PCR assays were established for the detection of SeACoV Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018a) . Real-time J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f RT-PCR is more powerful than RT-LAMP, with greater sensitivity and reproducibility for better quantification of pathogen. SYBR green-based and TaqMan-based methods have been developed for several SeACoV isolates (Ma et al., 2018) . Since the S gene is more prone to mutation and recombination, PCR-based methods mainly target the relatively conserved N and M gene. In addition there is a multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay for simultaneous detection of swine enteric PEDV, PDCoV (both targeting the M gene), TGEV and SeACoV (both targeting the N gene) .",

However, it is strange that SeACoV has not resulted in a large-scale epidemic in the pig industry in Guangdong in recent years, similar to the way SARS-CoV emerged in 2003 and then basically disappeared (Ksiazek et al., 2003) until the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 . This outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 and current pandemic also requires strict control to ensure the health of people around the world. Since all CoVs have the capability for recombination, no CoV epidemic can be taken lightly, even those in pigs (Opriessnig and Huang, 2020) . To prevent future outbreaks, unified detection methods are needed to establish better surveillance of SeACoV, including virological and serological methods.",

The presumed name \"SADS-CoV\" may not be appropriate since the available pathogenicity studies have not provided strong evidence of high virulence. The reverse genetic system for SeACoV has been established successfully in our lab (Yang et al., 2019a) , which will facilitate future studies exploring the molecular mechanisms of SeACoV replication J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 29 and pathogenicity. With the structural analysis of SeACoV and HKU2 S glycoproteins, it is also important to identify the primary receptor and study the mechanism of receptor binding. It is clear now more than ever that CoV-induced diseases not only pose a huge threat to the pig industry but also to human health. If HKU2-related CoVs emerge again, causing unknown damage to the pig industry, such basic research on SeACoV will be necessary to prevent and control future epidemics. domain Antibody assay based on the S1 domain of the S protein using a luciferase ",

Subsequently, a retrospective investigation of SeACoV at 45 pig farms from Guangdong province based on 236 diarrhea samples showed that SeACoV had emerged in Guangdong at least as early as August 2016 (Zhou et al., 2018a). This study also determined two additional genomic sequences CN/GDGL/2017 and CN/GDLS/2017 (MG605090 and MG605091) that shared nearly 100% nt identity with the sequence CN/GDWT/2017 (MG557844) based on our analysis (Fig. 3). Since 2010, PEDV variant strains associated with large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea in neonatal piglets have emerged in Mainland China (Huang et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2012). The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f successive discovery of PDCoV in 2015 and SeACoV in 2017 has taught us that the cause of piglet diarrhea in China may not be as simple as PEDV or TGEV. At present, there remains a lack of nationwide epidemiological investigation of newly emerging porcine enteric CoVs beyond PEDV and TGEV, and thus comprehensive, systematic research is urgently needed. 3.2. Current situation From May 2017 to January 2019, there were no new SeACoV cases arising in pig herds in Guangdong beyond the first outbreaks. In 2018, a new SeACoV strain (CH/FJWT/2018) was identified in pig stool and small intestine samples from seven pig farms in Fujian outside the Guangdong province (Fig. 1) (Li et al., 2018a). The complete genome (GenBank accession no. MH615810) was 27,168 nt in length, and there were a total of 13 nt insertions compared with the reference strain SeACoV-p10 (99.5% nt identity) (Fig. 3), including an extra seven nt (ACATGGG) at the 5'-end, a 3-nt (GGC) insertion at nt 22,473-22,474 in the S gene, and a 3-nt (GTA) insertion at nt 24,780-24,781 in the M gene.SeACoV reemerged in pig herds in Guangdong starting in February 2019(Zhou et al., 2019a), with an outbreak of diarrhea that caused the death of about 2,000 pigs at another pig farm near the original farms with the first outbreaks. This strain (CN/GDLX/2019, GenBank accession no. MK651076) shared approximately 100% nt identity with the \"Farm-D\" strain, and had an S gene that shares high nt identity (99.2-99.9%) with previously reported SeACoV strains from Guangdong in 2017, but lower identity (97.5%) with CH/FJWT/2018 from Fujian in 2018(Fig. 3).",

The discrepancies in the results from different challenged studies are very confusing since these SeACoV strains were obtained from the same source in the first outbreaks. One explanation may be attributed to the sequence differences in the SeACoV cell adapted strains used for challenge. By comparative analysis, we found that the sequences of CH/GD-01/2017 and CN/GDWT/2017 are almost identical at the genome level (99.9%), with no insertions and deletions, whereas GDS04-P12 shares 99.7% or 99.8% nt identity with CH/GD-01/2017 or insertion (T) at nt 27,067-27,068, and a 1-nt insertion (A) in nt 27,074-27,075.
