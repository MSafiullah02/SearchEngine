The virus has quickly spread around the globe and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. As of March 15, 2020, there are 153,517 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 49 states, 140+ countries, and on 6 continents [1, 2] . In the USA, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other health care facilities currently do not have an adequate supply of COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to meet the demand for possible cases. An increasing number of confirmed patients in the USA have now tested positive without a travel history or known exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Imaging findings for COVID-19 are non-specific and variable but most commonly show rounded pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities without lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, or pleural effusions [3] . Other less common imaging characteristics include bronchial wall thickening, linear opacities, crazy paving pattern, and the reverse halo sign. Patients imaged within the first 2 days of being infected can also show normal chest CT findings [4] .",

As of March 10, 2020, the turnaround time for the COVID-19 RT-PCR assay was 12-72 h [5]. One of the earliest publications on COVID-19 and CT imaging found that chest CT had a sensitivity of 98% for early presentation of COVID-19 compared with 71% using the RT-PCR assay. The lower sensitivity for RT-PCR found in this study may be due to improper sampling, low viral load at the time of testing, and various detection rates for different manufacturers [6] . While, as of March 22, 2020, the American College of Radiology does not recommend using chest CT as a screening tool for COVID-19 [7] , in patients with possible exposure to COVID-19 or suspicious symptoms, the RT-PCR assay may be used in conjunction with the chest CT findings to triage patients requiring hospitalization from spreading the infection to the vulnerable hospital patient population and frontline health care workers.",

In a recent non-peer-reviewed retrospective study of 214 hospitalized patients, 36.4% of patients with COVID-19 had neurologic symptoms with the most common being dizzy and headache, as well as 6 with ischemic strokes and 1 with an unspecified hemorrhagic stroke [10] .
