The children were admitted to the hospital for elective surgery. The parents \u00aelled a questionnaire about the occurrence of respiratory symptoms four weeks before and two weeks after the surgery. The rate of viral detection was 45% in children with related past or recent respiratory infection whereas 20% of the samples taken from children without any related past or recent respiratory infections were positive for picornavirus RNA, P 0.008. Thirty-one (29%) of the nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for viral RNA, 18% for rhinovirus, and 11% for enterovirus RNA. Coronavirus RNA was not found in any of the children. Fifty-\u00aeve percent of the children with virus-positive samples had an infection-related diagnosis. In addition, 81% of the children with virus-positive samples had had previously respiratory symptoms or there were concurrent respiratory symptoms in other family members. Only four of the 31 virus-positive samples were from children without infection-related diagnosis or recent past (or immediate future) respiratory symptoms.",

Theoretically, it is possible that a positive PCR \u00aending might also sometimes represent subclinical infection or, since RT-PCR assays detect viral RNA, remnants of past infection rather than an active current infection. However, the advantage of RT-PCR techniques for certain important respiratory viruses, namely human rhino-, entero-, and coronaviruses, cannot be questioned since for these viruses no other available practical and rapid techniques exist [Ieven and Goossens, 1997] . While nasopharyngeal colonization in healthy children with respiratory bacterial pathogens is shown by several studies [Faden et al., 1997; Faden, 1998; Bernstein, 1999] , less is known of respiratory viruses in this context. Johnston et al. [1993] have shown that respiratory picornaviruses can be found in 1.4% of healthy children by virus isolation and in 12% by PCR method. There are only a few other studies reported where the presence of respiratory viruses has been demonstrated in healthy children [Horn et al., 1979; Jennings et al., 1987] and in most of the previous studies of respiratory pathogens a control population of normal children was not included.",

Children with diagnosis not related to infections had statistically signi\u00aecantly less virus-positive samples than children with infection related diagnosis (P 0.008, Chi-Square Test).",

With conventional methods the prevalence of respiratory viruses has been approximately 3% [Horn et al., 1979; Hudgel et al., 1979; Jennings et al., 1987] . While in one study 12% of asymptomatic children were reported to be positive for rhinovirus in nasal aspirates by PCR [Johnston et al., 1993] , we are unaware of comparable studies concerning human entero-and coronaviruses. In the current study, the specimens were positive for enteroviruses in 11% of children, although only one child was enterovirus positive without preceding respiratory symptoms. Fecal excretion of enteroviruses is known to continue for several weeks after the acute phase symptoms, but how long nasopharyngeal secretion can continue, is not known.",
