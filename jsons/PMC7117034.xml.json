            "text": "We first review the distinctions between various terms that relate to misinformation. Following the 2016 US presidential election, the term \u201cfake news\u201d attracted substantial media and scholarly attention. The term overlaps with other forms of misleading information, and especially misinformation and disinformation, all conveying messages, stories, theories, or opinions that spread rapidly through social contacts or online media. They differ primarily with respect to intent and mode of spread. Misinformation involves information that is inadvertently false and is shared without intent to cause harm, while disinformation involves false information knowingly being created and shared to cause harm (Wardle and Derakhshan, 2017). Although \u201cfake news\u201d is the term that received most popular attention, it is arguably the most problematic one in terms of definitional rigour. Lazer et al. (2018) described it as fabricated information that mimics news media content, but this does not capture the complexity of the phenomenon, which can include both satire and information created deliberately to mislead as a means to achieve a political or other goal (Wardle, 2017). A recent report by a parliamentary committee in the UK concluded that \u201cThe term \u2018fake news\u2019 is bandied around with no clear idea of what it means, or agreed definition (House of Commons, 2019). The term has taken on a variety of meanings, including a description of any statement that is not liked or agreed with by the reader. We recommend that the Government rejects the term \u2018fake news\u2019, and instead puts forward an agreed definition of the words \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018disinformation\u2019\u201d. Since the phrase also has been politicized by powerful figures to discredit certain news media (Vosoughi et al., 2018), we refrain from using the term \u201cfake news\u201d throughout the paper.",

For example, anti-vaccine propaganda may be spread by those who have a genuine concern, however misguided, about safety, and by those who are using the issue as a tool to undermine trust in particular governments. Thus, unless the intent is clear, we use the term misinformation as an umbrella term to include all forms of false information related to health, thereby giving those generating it the benefit of the doubt.",

Our review will look at whether and how existing literature from different disciplines examine the type of actor behind the creation of health-related messages on social media platforms, the descriptive features of the message \u2013 the durability and distribution of accurate and misleading information - and most importantly, the interpreter's response and how it contributes to the reproduction of misinformation. At the micro-level, individuals who receive misinformation form judgement about the believability of the message, depending on information source, narrative and context, while the tendency to spread depends on the degree to which receivers suspect such misinformation (Karlova and Fisher, 2013). At the macro-level, we observe patterns of misinformation cascade and characteristics of networks.",

            "text": "According to Allport and Postman (1947), the ambiguity of the message may be due to the receipt of conflicting stories, with no one more credible than another. The concept of credibility, as investigated extensively in communications research, encompasses message credibility, source credibility, and media credibility (Metzger et al., 2003). With traditional media, each aspect of information credibility is relatively well understood, although even there some caution is needed. In contrast, with social media, it is particularly challenging to assess the source credibility, as users themselves are the self-publisher, subject to no form of factual verification or accountability. We do know that people regard information from the internet as being as credible as conventional media such as television and radio, but not as that from newspapers (Johnson and Kaye, 1998; Kim and Johnson, 2009). Many studies have thus analysed the credibility of user-generated contents and the cognitive process involved in the decision to spread online information on social and political events (Abbasi and Liu, 2013; Castillo et al., 2011; Lupia, 2013; Swire et al., 2017). This research has highlighted the importance of source credibility and persuasiveness as factors affecting the susceptibility of users to the messages conveyed. Other relevant studies have focused on important concepts such as misperception and confirmation bias, whereby people's views on factual matters are strongly influenced by prior beliefs (Taber and Lodge, 2006; Nyhan and Reifler, 2010; Jerit and Barabas, 2012); polarization within networks (Lewandowsky et al., 2012); and the combined effects of these phenomenon facilitated by social media (Del Vicario et al., 2016; Boutyline and Willer, 2017; Shao et al., 2018). While much of the existing literature has examined social and political issues, we focus on misinformation related to health and wellbeing.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of why certain individuals, societies and institutions are more vulnerable to misinformation about health. This is perhaps surprising, as health promotion and public health researchers now pay considerable attention to the potential of the internet as a tool to diffuse health-related information (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; Ritterband and Tate, 2009; Murray et al., 2009; Scanfeld et al., 2010; Signorini et al., 2011), employing smart phones and other mobile technologies in preventative interventions (Abroms et al., 2013; Eng and Lee, 2013; Free et al., 2013; Steinhubl et al., 2015). Although the internet provides immense opportunities, it also lowers the cost of generating and disseminating information, allowing misinformation and sensationalized stories to propagate. What was once spread locally can rapidly become global, with ideas no longer confined or delayed by geography. This has generated a series of studies of information diffusion (Serrano et al., 2015), rumour spread (He et al., 2015), and consequent behavioural changes (Salath\u00e9 and Khandelwal, 2011; Wakamiya et al., 2016). These generally employ sophisticated modelling and simulation techniques to identify the rumour propagation dynamics. However, this is still in its infancy and one recent systematic review of behavioural change models found that most papers investigating spread of health-related information and behavioural changes are theoretical, failing to use real-life social media data (Verelst et al., 2016). The literature on misinformation spread is growing, but spans disparate disciplines, including communication studies, epidemiology, psychology, and computational science. We contend that it is now necessary to integrate the different perspective and methodologies, to understand the characteristics of susceptible populations and to devise interventions that are most effective in countering this spread.",

            "text": "Vaccine uptake, especially in children, has fluctuated in recent decades in many developed countries, with marked declines during certain periods. In 2012, the journal Vaccine devoted a special issue to \u201cThe Role of Internet Use in Vaccination\u201d, analysing some of the communication strategies used by both the anti-vaccination movement and public health professionals. Authors recommended comprehensive, structured, and easily understandable responses to anti-vaccination messages (Betsch and Sachse, 2012; Kata, 2012; Reyna, 2012; Nicholson and Leask, 2012). Although refusal of vaccination and movements opposing vaccines date back to the time of Jenner, publication of fraudulent research linking the MMR vaccine to autism and bowel disease (Wakefield et al., 1998) was a seminal moment. The concerns raised then, although long since discredited, have been widely disseminated on social media and even now are highly influential among some groups. For instance, Basch et al. (2017), Donzelli et al. (2018) and Porat et al. (2018) report high online prevalence and popularity of autism-related discussions in fora on vaccination. Tustin et al. (2018) and Xu and Guo (2018) also reported widespread misinformation about side effects, as well as mistrust in government or pharmaceutical companies in discussions on vaccination. Krishna's (2017) study of active propagators of these messages found that those who were knowledge-deficient and vaccine-averse exhibit higher levels of activity than those who are not. Aquino et al. (2017) reported a significant inverse correlation between MMR vaccination coverage and online searches and social network activity on \u201cautism and MMR vaccine\u201d. Taken as a whole, the research identifies anti-vaxxer and members of online communities favouring conspiracy theories as sources or propagators of misinformation, with discussions tending to revolve around rhetorical and personal arguments that induce negative emotions (fear, anger, sadness). Although there is less misinformation than accurate information, the former has greater popularity among viewers.",

For instance, the Zika virus was portrayed as a bioweapon, while rumours spread that the Zika vaccine had been developed to depopulate the earth (Sommariva et al., 2018; Wood, 2018). Conspiracist ideation played a crucial role in one's belief in misinformation (Lewandowsky et al., 2013).

Similar patterns are observed in discussions on water fluoridation, as memorably invoked in the 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove. Seymour et al.

While theories in psychology focus on individual-level cognitive response to misinformation and its corrections, frameworks in network and data science characterise the (online) societal mechanisms involved. For instance, Chua and Banerjee (2018), in investigating the online behaviour in the face of health rumours, invoked the seminal rumour theory (Allport and Postman, 1947), which views personal involvement as a common perception that dictates one's decision to spread rumour. Moreover, rumours that are repeatedly circulated can be reinforced and accepted as credible (Rosnow, 1991), and the consequent perceived high credibility can in turn increase intention to trust and share rumours (Shin et al., 2017). This relates to credibility research, which suggests that perceived credibility and can heighten the persuasive impact, especially for internet users who are not motivated to process information (Metzger, 2007; Metzger et al., 2010). Similarly, Ozturk et al. (2015) explored how different social media settings can reduce rumour spread based on rumour psychology research. Others have referred to psychological studies around conspiracist ideation, inoculation theory and social conformity in understanding the mechanism behind health misperception on social media (Bode and Vraga, 2018; Bora et al., 2018; Li and Sakamoto, 2015). Contrastingly, the use of system or network theories are aimed at explaining the patterns of social influence, social learning, social contagion and homophily and polarization processes (Bessi et al., 2015; Radzikowski et al., 2016; Schmidt et al., 2018; Sicilia et al., 2017; Wood, 2018). The framework typically assists the subsequent social network analysis.",

In co-citation network analysis, the unit of analysis is the cited source, and we include the journals cited at least 5 times within the 121 articles. As seen in Fig. 4\n, the distance in the map between any pair of journals reflects their similarity to each other (van Eck and Waltman, 2010), and we use the LinLog/modularity normalization technique to minimize the distance between connected nodes (Noack, 2009). The size of the nodes represents the number of citations, and the line indicates the presence of citation in either direction. The analysis identified 4 distinct (inter-)disciplinary clusters, which we assigned as follows (with randomly generated colours, from left to right): Social Psychology and Communications (red), General Science and Medicine (blue), Infectious Disease/Vaccine and Public Health (green), Medical Internet and Biomedical Science (purple). Overall, the literature is concentrated in general science and vaccines/infectious diseases. Psychology and communications literature sit on the periphery, with relatively less cross-citation with the science and medicine literature. Interestingly, we also observe a few sociology journals at the bordering regions between clusters, implying their incipient roles in acknowledging different insights across disciplines. There is potential for greater interdisciplinary collaboration.",

Overall, existing research finds that misinformation is abundant on the internet and is often more popular than accurate information. Several of the studies address areas where state action challenges individual autonomy. The classic example is vaccination, where effective protection of the population requires achievement of levels of uptake sufficient to achieve herd immunity. This review confirms that misconceptions about MMR vaccine and autism, in particular, remain prevalent on social media (Aquino et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018a,b). Other topics share scientific uncertainty, with the authorities unable to provide confident explanations or advice, as with newly emerging virus infections such as Ebola and Zika viruses (Basch et al., 2017; Fung et al., 2016; Sommariva et al., 2018).",

Formal institutions are increasingly challenged by the rise of, for instance, \u201cexpert patient\u201d, blurring the boundaries between authority and quasi-proficiency (Seymour et al., 2015). Traditional vertical health communication strategies are eroded by horizontal diffusion of conspiracy-like messages. The narratives of misinformation are dominated by personal, negative and opinionated tones, which often induce fear, anxiety and mistrust in institutions (Bessi et al., 2015; Panatto et al., 2018; Porat et al., 2018). When people are frightened and doubtful, they can be more susceptible to misinformation. Once false information gains acceptance in such circumstances, it is difficult to correct, and the effectiveness of interventions vary according to each individual's personal involvement, literacy and socio-demographic characteristics, features that tend to be under-explored in existing research.",

The majority of the articles included a content analysis of the information on social media, ranging from text, images and videos. Several studies employed complexity and network theories to model the dynamics of rumour spread and opinion polarization (Bessi et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2014). Other studies have adopted psychological and linguistic perspectives (Fung et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Waszak et al., 2018). While we have excluded research on both individual and group biases, we feel it is important to note how several studies invoked the concept of confirmation bias, concluding that it plays an important role in creating online echo-chambers (Bessi et al., 2015; Donzelli et al., 2018). This highlights the need for much more research on the socio-psychological characteristics of those who believe and propagate misinformation. In particular, there is a need to understand better the roles of both ideology and belief systems (Jost et al., 2018) and what might be termed \u201clazy thinking\u201d (Pennycook and Rand, 2018). For instance, although the role of literacy and cues to credibility are critical concepts in the design of experiments, they should also be explored in empirical studies, and especially those that use big data from social media platforms.",

First, although we have attempted to define the phenomenon we are studying, our search strategy may not capture the terminology used by others. This is not just a problem of language. There are many related phenomena, such as denialism, groupthink, fearmongering, and equivalents in other languages, such as L\u00fcgenpresse (lying press) in German and it is possible that these or others may be used, in some circumstances, to describe some elements of what we are studying. Second, even when we agree the terms, such as misinformation and \u2018fake news\u2019, the meanings adopted by authors can vary. Third, as noted at the outset, it is very difficult to ascertain the motives of those spreading particular rumours and myths, leaving us unable to answer the old question \u201cmad or bad?\u201d. Fourth, while our focus has been on messages concerning health-related issues, misinformation about other issues can have health consequences. For instance, a man from North Carolina travelled to Washington in 2016 and opened fire at a pizzeria following the spread of what became termed the Pizzagate theory, whereby it was alleged that the pizzeria was the site of a paedophile ring organised by Democratic Party leaders. Even though comprehensively debunked, subsequent polls showed that this allegation was still widely believed. Finally, since we excluded articles that are not published in English, we may have omitted relevant papers published in other languages.",

            "text": "Social media platforms, although providing immense opportunities for people to engage with each other in ways that are beneficial, also allow misinformation to flourish. Without filtering or fact-checking, these online platforms enable communities of denialists to thrive, for instance by feeding into each other's feelings of persecution by a corrupt elite (McKee and Diethelm, 2010). The accumulation of individual beliefs in these unfounded stories, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience can give rise to social movements, such as the anti-vaccination movement, with profound consequences for public health. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is politically incorrect to question or criticize the belief of others, and the fight for truth is nevertheless against the flow of true believers armed with ignorance and misinformation (Kaufman et al., 2018).",

Among the articles examined, there is broad consensus that misinformation is highly prevalent on social media and tends to be more popular than accurate information, while its narrative often induces fear, anxiety and mistrust in institutions. The severity and the deleterious effects it may pose on the society is hardly quantifiable, but evidence abounds that we need more research on the identification of susceptible populations, and on the understanding of socio-demographic and ideological asymmetries in the intention to spread misinformation.",

            "text": "Finally, since the persistence of misinformation owes both to the psychological responses and to the social contexts under which misinformation spread, potential interventions should target both fronts. At the individual level, although interventions to correct misperceptions are proven effective at times, efforts to retract misinformation need to be carried out with caution in order to prevent backfiring. This requires profound understanding on how epistemic and ideology beliefs act as obstacles to accepting scientific evidence. A more constructive approach may be to cultivate critical thinking and to improve health and media literacy, thereby equipping individuals with the faculty to critically assess the credibility of information. At the system level, how we can amend our information ecosystem to reduce selective exposure and opinion polarization is not a challenge for academics and policy-makers alone to face. We therefore hope that our review can stimulate social scientists, psychologists, computer scientist and medical professionals to not only collaborate with each other, but also engage with industries and internet consumers to understand and counter the effects of this increasingly important social phenomenon.",
