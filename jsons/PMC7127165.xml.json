            "text": "During the first epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which began in November of 2002 in Guandong Province of the People's Republic of China, and lasted for about 7 months, close to 8100 people were infected worldwide, among which 774 people died (WHO, 2003). The etiological agent of this atypical respiratory disease has been identified as a novel coronavirus (designated as SARS-CoV) Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Poutanen et al., 2003. With a mortality rate of over 9%, SARS-CoV had a major health and socioeconomic impact. Fortunately, there have been very few incidences of SARS infections during the winter season of 2003\u20132004. However, with multiple modes of virus transmission and a wide range of potential nonhuman reservoirs including wild animals commonly found in markets (e.g., civet cats and raccoon dogs; Guan et al., 2003) as well as domestic cats (Martina et al., 2003), it is highly likely that a virus of this nature will most certainly resurface in the future. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs, immunotherapeutic agents, or vaccines available against the virus. To better control or prevent future epidemics, anti-SARS-CoV drugs and/or vaccines need to be developed.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV belongs to Coronaviridae family. The genomic organization of the virus is similar to that of other coronaviruses with a general order of replicase (Rep; ORFs-1a and 1b), spike (S)-glycoprotein, envelope (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid (N) from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003\n(Fig. 1)\n. Several open-reading frames have also been identified, which may encode additional proteins Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Snijder et al., 2003. Their functions, however, are not known at the present time. The protein of a major interest as a target of antiviral drug development efforts as well as for developing vaccines is S-glycoprotein. S-protein of coronaviruses, which is thought to function as a trimer (Delmas and Laude, 1990), is responsible for both binding to cellular receptors and inducing membrane fusion for virus entry into target cells Collins et al., 1982, Godet et al., 1994, Kubo et al., 1994. Mutations in the protein have been shown to alter virulence and cellular tropism Fazakerley et al., 1992, Leparc-Goffart et al., 1998, Sanchez et al., 1999. Taken together, the S-protein plays a critical role in the biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Not surprisingly, it is an important target of virus-neutralizing antibodies Chang et al., 2002, Collins et al., 1982, Fleming et al., 1983, Godet et al., 1994, Kant et al., 1992, Kubo et al., 1993, Kubo et al., 1994, Takase-Yoden et al., 1991. Moreover, mice immunized with a recombinant S-protein, or a peptide derived from it, are protected from lethal challenges with murine hepatitis virus (MHV) Daniel and Talbot, 1990, Koo et al., 1999.",

            "text": "S-protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein, which is translated on membrane-bound polysomes, inserted into rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), cotranslationally glycosylated, and transported to the Golgi complex. During the transport, S-proteins are incorporated onto maturing virus particles, which assemble and bud into a compartment that lies between the RER and Golgi (Lai and Holmes, 2001). Virions are carried from Golgi to plasma membrane in secretory vesicles. Virions are released from cells when virion-containing vesicles fuse with plasma membrane. Excess S-proteins not incorporated onto virus particles are transported to the surface of plasma membrane Lai and Holmes, 2001, Tsai et al., 1999, Yamada et al., 1998. S-protein of SARS-CoV is 1255 amino acids long (Fig. 1). It is predicted to have a 13 amino acid signal peptide at the amino-terminus, a single ectodomain (1182 amino acids) and a transmembrane region followed by a short cytoplasmic tail (28 residues) at the carboxy-terminus Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003. Due to low sequence homology between the S-protein of SARS-CoV and that of the other coronaviruses Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, the structural and immunogenic properties of SARS-CoV S-protein must be ascertained experimentally. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV has recently been identified to be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Li et al., 2003). The molecular interactions between the S-protein and ACE2 are not yet known. Better understanding of the interactions could lead to development of virus entry inhibitors.",

An accurate assessment of Nab responses in virus-infected patients is needed to determine immune correlates of protection. It is also an essential and integral part of a vaccine development process. Conventional virus-neutralization assays require the use of replication-competent, infectious viruses. Evaluating virus-neutralizing activity of a large number of antisera with these assays is undesirable due to safety concerns, especially for a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) pathogen like SARS-CoV. The same safety concerns have prompted our laboratory to utilize replication-defective pseudoviruses for HIV-1 neutralization assay (Kim et al., 2001). In this assay, nonreplicating Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles pseudotyped with HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins are used (Schnierle et al., 1997). These pseudoviruses encode a \u03b2-galactosidase gene, which allows detection of individual infected cells when stained with X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside). In this study, we report development of a SARS-CoV pseudovirus neutralization assay, which should be particularly valuable for researchers who may not have easy access to BSL3 containment facility. Additionally, we describe a high-throughput system for quantitative analyses of X-Gal stained cells. This assay system should facilitate rapid evaluation of antibody responses to vaccine candidates and/or entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV.",

To detect S-protein, Western blot was performed with convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients. However, no clear protein band was detected despite number of attempts. We reasoned that one of the possibilities for the inability to detect the protein is a low level of S-protein expressed from pcDNA-S. To increase the amount of S-protein expressed, we subcloned the S gene into pHCMV-G vector (Burns et al., 1993), which expresses high level of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein. Although we were able to express higher amount of S-protein (see below), this was not sufficient to detect a clear band on Western blots. An alternative explanation is that antibodies against the protein in convalescent sera cannot recognize S-protein subjected to denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE (viz. linear epitopes). However, because results from radioimmunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence assays were also ambiguous, it is most likely that the antibody titer against S-protein is very low in convalescent sera.",

The presence of encephalomyocarditis virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) at the 5\u2032 end of RNA transcripts allows efficient translation of mRNA transcribed in cytoplasm.

To better demonstrate this, we generated another clone (pTM-eSHis) that expresses the entire ectodomain of S-protein (amino acids 1\u20131190) with a six-histidine tag at the carboxy terminus. The ectodomain of S-protein migrated with an approximate molecular weight of 163 kDa while its calculated molecular weight is only 131.2 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 2). To demonstrate that this difference is due to glycosylation, eSHis protein was treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) or peptide: N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 3 and 4), treatment with either glycosidase increased the mobility of the protein to approximately 133 kDa. Because the mobility of the protein treated with either glycosidases was the same, S-protein is most likely modified with high mannose and/or hybrid, rather than complex, oligosaccharides. While S-glycoprotein of some coronaviruses is cleaved into two subdomains, S1 and S2, the fact that we observed only a single band suggests that SARS-CoV S-protein functions as a single unit.",

This yield is comparable to what we have been able to achieve for HIV-1 pseudoviruses (between 2 \u00d7 103 and 2 \u00d7 104 depending on envelopes; Kim et al., 2001), but lower than VSV-G pseudovirus yield (between 3 \u00d7 104 and 9 \u00d7 104 depending on target cell lines used). Interestingly, SARS pseudovirus production was about 20-fold less efficient when plasmid transfection was performed by calcium phosphate method compared with using cationic lipids (lipofection). This difference, however, was not observed for VSV-G pseudovirus production. An additional difference was that a longer incubation time was needed to achieve peak pseudovirus production for SARS-S compared to VSV-G (3 vs. 2 days posttransfection, respectively).

The number of infectious foci counted was quite linear as a function of virus inoculum (Fig. 5C), validating the methodology.

            "text": "In this study, we expressed SARS-CoV S-glycoprotein, which was able to pseudotype MuLV particles. SARS pseudoviruses were able to efficiently infect Vero E6 cells, which have been shown to support SARS-CoV infection. The infection did not require low pH, suggesting viral entry is mediated by a direct fusion event between viral and plasma membranes. This result is consistent with a previous report that cell-to-cell fusion mediated by S-protein and its cellular receptor ACE2 occurred at neutral pH (Xiao et al., 2003). However, our result is in direct disagreement with recently published article by Simmons et al. (2004). There are three major differences in experimental procedures between the two studies. First, we pseudotyped MuLV particles whereas Simmons et al. used HIV-1. Second, we used an authentic S-glycoprotein whereas they used a C-terminal fusion protein that included a V5 epitope and polyhistidine tag, which totaled, by our estimation, 27 extra amino acids. Whether the discrepant result is due to the use of different S-glycoproteins and/or different virus cores needs to be further investigated. The third difference between the studies is the concentrations of lysosomotropic agents used. While we used NH4Cl at 0\u201350 \u03bcM amounts, which are sufficient to inhibit VSV-G-mediated fusion (Fig. 3; Picard-Maureau et al., 2003), they used millimolar (mM) amounts. At these concentrations, NH4Cl could have a secondary effect on S-glycoprotein. We were unable to find concentrations of chloroquine used in their study. It is interesting to note that while Simmons et al. observed that pseudovirus infections required low pH, S-protein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion did not.",

In contrast, convalescent sera have been successfully used to detect SARS-CoV-infected cells by an immunofluorescence assay Hsueh et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003. Together, the available data seem to suggest that S-protein might not be immunogenic, at least compared to other viral proteins.

            "text": "The nonimmunogenic nature of S-protein might present potential problems in developing a vaccine that can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. In this regard, it is interesting to note that S-protein is highly glycosylated with 23 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. Based on our analyses of the ectodomain of the protein, carbohydrate residues account for approximately 30 kDa (based on mobility in SDS-PAGE). The glycans were primarily high mannose and/or hybrid type. This, however, needs to be verified using proteins produced from nonvaccinia virus expression system, because the virus infection could possibly affect cellular glycosylation machinery. Extensive glycosylation of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein has been one of the major obstacles in eliciting good humoral responses against the protein and in developing an effective vaccine against the virus (Cho, 2003). It remains to be seen whether and to what extent glycans on S-protein affect immunogenic properties of the protein. Interestingly, potential glycosylation sites are clustered into three regions of the protein (Fig. 1A): N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal. It has been shown that individual glycosylation sites on HIV-1 surface glycoprotein gp120 may have different functions; while some are important for evading immune responses, others are critical for maintaining proper protein structure necessary to interact with cellular receptors and mediate membrane fusion Ogert et al., 2001, Reitter et al., 1998. Additional studies are needed to determine whether glycosylation sites in different clusters of S-protein serve different functions.",

Despite high sensitivity, their utility has some limitations: (i) the detection rate varies widely between 20% and 80% depending on clinical samples and protocols used for the assay; (ii) the window of detectability is limited to early stages of infection; and (iii) the assay is not suitable for routine surveillance. Antibodies against SARS proteins have been shown to appear as early as 9 days after the onset of illness (Hsueh et al., 2003). Therefore, development of a high-throughput serology-based diagnostics could complement PCR-based assays. In this regard, a virus-neutralization assay could be used as a confirmatory test, which would enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis of SARS-CoV. Because neutralizing antibodies are important for virus clearance, the assay could also be used to assess disease prognosis. In either case, the availability of SARS pseudoviruses allows avoiding the use of infectious SARS-CoV.",

The S gene in pcDNA-S*, which was transferred from pENTR-S (BamHI\u2013EcoRI fragment), lacks the original translation stop codon TAA because it was changed to AAT of EcoRI restriction site (gAATtc). pcDNA-S with a stop codon was constructed by replacing a SwaI\u2013EcoRI fragment of pcDNA-S* with the same fragment from pCR-S. To generate pHCMV-S, a BamHI\u2013EcoRI fragment from pcDNA-S was inserted into a BamHI site of pHCMV-G following blunting ends with Klenow. To construct pTM-S, a BamHI\u2013XhoI fragment from pcDNA-S was cloned into the corresponding sites of pTM\u2013NdeI (Cho et al., 1994). Despite the fact that pTM-S has a small open-reading frame that encodes eight amino acids between the Internal Ribosome Entry Site of pTM-NdeI vector and the S gene, S-protein was efficiently expressed and the plasmid was used as is without further modification.
