As of 26 March 2020, the WHO reported 250,592 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe with 13,950 deaths, almost 54% of which had occurred in Italy [1]. The dynamics of the viral diffusion in Italy, especially in the northern region of Lombardy, lead to a stressful burden on the healthcare system, particularly on the emergency departments and the intensive care units (ICU), with almost 10% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) needing invasive respiratory assistance. To avoid aqueous droplets dispersion during active disease, the use of high flow oxygen and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) is generally not recommended in case of the unavailability of negative pressure isolation rooms, high level protective equipment, and adequate monitoring systems [2,3], usually currently lacking in the majority of the medical units involved in the management of COVID-19 patients during the emergency. Moreover, the application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicating a viral pneumonia has been demonstrated to be unable to change the clinical course of the disease [3]. However, the frequent lack of ICU beds have pushed the authorities to create numerous new respiratory intermediate care units (RICU) and convert to this purpose many general internal medicine units, in order to face the increasing number of patients with severe pneumonia and ARDS-needing respiratory support and monitoring.",

            "text": "The pathophysiological consequence of the bilateral ground glass opacities and the parenchymal consolidations, as seen in COVID-19 pneumonia, is represented by a substantial intrapulmonary shunt likely coupled with a ventilation/perfusion mismatch, especially in otherwise healthy subjects. This observation is sustained by the small increase in partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) despite delivering increasing inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) percentages, as it is frequently seen in COVID-19 patients during conventional O2 supplementation. Moreover, lung infiltrates appear to cause an \u201catypical\u201d form of ARDS, in which an impressive shunt fraction (mean \u00b1 standard deviation; 0.50 \u00b1 0.11) [4] is associated with a relatively high compliance (50.2 \u00b1 14.3 mL/cmH2O) [4]. This event may be justified by the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction [4], and by a hypercoagulability state [5] with consequent pulmonary microvascular coagulation. Post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates, desquamation of pneumocytes, and hyaline membrane formation [6]. This lung tissue damage results in a severe acute HRF characterized by significant hypoxia and normal or reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2).",

            "text": "The application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during acute HRF secondary to pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or pneumonia has been demonstrated to improve arterial oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity, shifting the tidal volume to a more compliant part of the pressure-volume curve, thus reducing both the work of breathing and the risk of tidal opening and closure of the airways [7]. Moreover, the application of PEEP recruits non-aerated alveoli in dependent pulmonary regions, stabilizes the airways, and reduces the inhomogeneity of lung volume distribution [7]. PEEP can be applied to spontaneous breathing patients in the form of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) [8]. CPAP is considered to be a valuable initial approach for patients suffering from acute de novo HRF and mild-moderate ARDS. In fact, non-invasive ventilation with a face mask can fail because of poor patient compliance and technical problems tied to the interface seal [9]. Around twenty years ago, the helmet had been proposed as an alternative to traditional interfaces. The helmet equipment, although slightly varying in some details between manufacturers, is schematically presented in Figure S1. Briefly, it consists in a transparent, latex free, polyvinylchloride hood joined by a metal or plastic ring to a soft polyvinylchloride collar of different sizes [10]. Two underarm straps are attached to the ring which keeps it from flying upwards when the gas flow pressurizes it [10]. The average volume of the hood ranges from 12 to 15 L with the patient\u2019s head in place. The high flow gas enters the hood from one side, while on the opposite side, an expiratory port with an integrated manometer and an adjustable or fixed PEEP valve are applied (Figure S1). The anti-suffocation valve is applied on the hood\u2019s surface and fixed by means of a screw shaped mechanism for rapid access to the inner part of the helmet (Figure S1).",

Moreover, the helmet CPAP applied in patients with severe HRF due to pneumonia demonstrated to reduce the risk of meeting the criteria for endotracheal intubation compared with the Venturi mask [12].

In the current restricted availability of negative pressure rooms, we suggest applying an anti-viral filter both on the inspiratory and on the expiratory ports of the helmet (Figure S1). This should maximally reduce the risk of droplets dispersion. It should be noted that in case of sneezing or coughing, the helmet appears to be more practical and comfortable compared with conventional oronasal masks.",

            "text": "Compared with the face mask, the helmet, due to its larger internal volume, might facilitate CO2 rebreathing [22]. The inspired CO2 concentration was found to be constantly higher when CPAP was delivered by means of a continuous flow CPAP helmet (for flows ranging from 20 to 60 L and PEEP from 0 to 15 cmH2O) than with a face mask (mean \u00b1 standard deviation; 3.1 \u00b1 0.15 versus 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 mmHg, p < 0.01) [18]. This was also true when the helmet was tested during pressure support ventilation [23]. However, for CPAP delivery, higher flow rates corresponded lower inspired concentrations of CO2 [18]. The CO2 rebreathing depends primarily on two factors: (a) the fresh gas passing through the helmet, and (b) the amount of CO2 produced by the patient [22,24]. The presence of an antisuffocation valve (Figure S1) limits the CO2 rebreathing, but cannot prevent the loss of PEEP in case of gas flow interruption [22]. In this case, the adoption of larger valves allows for a lower CO2 rebreathing, but also a higher reduction in FiO2 [25]. When CPAP is administered by means of mechanical ventilators, it is generally not advisable to use the helmet [8,22] because the higher compliance of the helmet may cause a delay between the delivered inspiratory flow and patients\u2019 inspiratory effort, which can cause patient-ventilatory asynchrony. Moreover, the mixing between the inspired and expired flows predisposes to CO2 rebreathing [8]. The most effective CPAP is achieved when the PEEP level is maintained throughout the respiratory cycle, with inspiratory fluctuations in PEEP reflecting an insufficient gas delivery compared with the patient minute ventilation [10]. This is why high flow systems should be preferred when administering CPAP with the helmet.",

            "text": "Helmet CPAP is currently being extensively used in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the relative simplicity of setting up a CPAP helmet, the need for attentive and careful monitoring of the respiratory and hemodynamic response to the application of PEEP should be part of the standard operating procedures of the unit. Based on the observation and care provided so far to more than 70 COVID-19 patients with HRF in our RICU, we propose that the initiation of the CPAP treatment should always depend upon the PaO2/FiO2 ratio rather than on peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) or the respiratory rate (RR), as falsely high SpO2 and low RR may be often secondary to the frequent mixed or metabolic alkalosis experienced by COVID-19 patients due to dehydration, iatrogenic diarrhea, and hypoalbuminemia [21,26]. In fact, an increase of pH value causes a left shift of the oxygen\u2013hemoglobin dissociation curve, while hypocapnia makes the alveolar ventilation-PaO2 relationship much steeper only at values of PaO2 much lower than those usually considered as the cutoff for respiratory failure [26]. In addition, in the early phases of a progressive HRF, especially in case of otherwise healthy young subjects, the respiratory rate might be a less reliable sign of hypoxia due to the ability of these subjects to increase the minute ventilation by increasing the tidal volume before showing signs of respiratory distress [27]. Therefore, arterial blood gas analysis should be used as the main monitoring tool for establishing the need for CPAP and its titration. Initiating CPAP with pressures as low as 5 cmH2O should allow to control and adjust for potential cardiovascular and pulmonary side effects (Figure 1). In our opinion, PEEP should not exceed 12\u201313 cmH2O in order to avoid barotrauma, self-induced lung injury, tension pneumothorax, and negative effects on hemodynamics [7]. Moreover, it has been suggested that COVID-19 pulmonary infiltrates are associated with poor recruitability, thus high PEEP should be avoided to preserve patients from severe hemodynamic impairment and fluid retention [4]. Coppola and coworkers [28] have recently demonstrated that in patients with ARDS undergoing lung protective ventilation, the amount of intrinsic PEEP is negligible. If present, intrinsic PEEP did not change the total airway resistance, compliance of the respiratory system, and lung recruitability [28]. This observation, along with the aforementioned PEEP side effects [7], sustains the hypothesis that higher levels of PEEP (e.g., >15 cmH2O) during non-invasive CPAP application and without the continuous monitoring of lung mechanics available only in the ICU should be avoided.",

Surprisingly, the application of CPAP is not mentioned [31]. Due to the pathophysiology of the acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, we believe that an approach based on non-invasive ventilation, unless hypercapnia is present, could be avoided. Considering also the poor availability of negative pressure rooms in the majority of hospitals involved in the current pandemic, and the need for preserving the healthcare personnel from viral contamination, an approach based on non-invasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy should be left only to specific and protected settings [15,32]. In Table S1, we present preliminary data about in hospital mortality of patients treated in our RICU, compared with data available in literature so far. Although care settings and populations are inhomogeneous, in the majority of cases, the ARDS severity and mortality of patients treated with the helmet CPAP is comparable to ICU cohorts (Table S1).",
