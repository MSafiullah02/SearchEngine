            "text": "The intent of this study was to demonstrate approaches to identifying and characterizing glycopeptides by MALDI\u2010MS in complex peptide mixtures, instead of omitting and discarding their precursor ion signals in global proteomics analyses. The aim was not to attempt identification of all glycopeptides in a mixture, but rather to use signals that were left unidentified in a proteomics search,17, 18 and relate these to glycopeptides through signature MALDI\u2010MS and MS/MS patterns. A component of the research involved MALDI\u2010MS spectra derived from the analysis of HPLC fractions containing many peptides and glycopeptides. Under these conditions it was still possible, in some cases, to quickly detect glycoforms of peptides based on the characteristic patterns of peaks separated by 162 u (mannose, galactose), 203 u (N\u2010acetylglucosamine) or 291 u (N\u2010acetylneuraminic acid). They are also easy to distinguish from bare (non\u2010modified) peptides by their high m/z values relative to those of coeluting peptides. Reverse\u2010phase HPLC elutes unmodified peptides in order of increasing hydrophobicity. The elution order, to some extent, correlates with peptide molecular mass because larger peptides are more likely to contain more hydrophobic amino acids. Therefore, early HPLC fractions were enriched with low molecular mass species and, conversely, the later fractions contained an increased proportion of large peptides. The addition of glycans results in an accelerated elution rate, i.e. a glycopeptide has a shorter retention time, but higher mass, than its unmodified analog. Typical mass spectra of HPLC fractions therefore exhibit mostly non\u2010glycosylated peptides at the lower m/z end, and glycopeptide ions at the higher end. The latter are somewhat isolated in the spectrum, and are thus easy to distinguish from unmodified peptide [M+H]+ ions. Figure 1 shows two examples of such results in the higher m/z sections of spectra for high\u2010mannose glycoforms (Fig. 1(a)) and for complex/sialylated glycoforms (Fig. 1(b)).",

The presence of sialic acid was clearly identified through facile losses of these residues (\u2212291 u). Successive losses of 162 u from the precursors indicated high\u2010mannose glycan structures, whereas mixed losses of 162 and 203 u indicated the presence of complex oligosaccharides.

The latter corresponded to 1216.4, 1378.4, 1540.5, 1702.5, and 1864.6 u, from top to bottom in Fig. 2. These masses correspond to within 0.003% accuracy to compositions [GlcNAc]2[Man]x, with x = 5\u20139. In some other cases, [Peptide+H\u201317]+ and [Peptide+H]+ ions had very low abundances; however, dominant [Peptide+84]+ and [Peptide+204]+ ion peaks were always observed and by deduction allowed measurement of the peptide mass.

Interestingly this portion of the spectrum did not vary with the size of the glycan attached to the peptide, i.e. from (a) to (e) in Fig. 2.

Spectral portions above m/z 2400 exhibit successive losses of hexose (\u2212162 u) and N\u2010acetylglucosamine (\u2212203 u), showing that fragmentation occurs in both chains of the biantennary glycans. In all three spectra, the [Peptide+GlcNAc]+ ions are abundant at m/z 2400, along with [Peptide+84]+ (m/z 2280), [Peptide+H]+(m/z 2197), and [Peptide+H\u201317]+ (m/z 2180) species. Figure 5 displays a close\u2010up of the low m/z section of Fig. 4(a), which again varies in intensity but is the same for all three MS/MS spectra in terms of ions observed. In spite of three major unidentified peaks, \u2018SonarMS/MS\u2019 found a matching peptide with no ambiguity, DQCIVDDITYNVNDTFHK from human fibronectin. Knowing the sequence, the unidentified peaks were quickly recognized as [y+GlcNAc] fragments, with the GlcNAc residue adding 203 u to the masses of the predicted y and b fragments. Also, [y+83] and [b+83] fragments were identified, the 83 u portion corresponding to [CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2010acetyl] originating from 0,2X0 cross\u2010ring fragmentations of the connecting GlcNAc residues.14 Table 2 lists all b\u2010 or y\u2010related product ions observed in the MS/MS spectrum of Fig. 5. At this stage, these ions had to be identified and labeled manually, as the database search does not include variants of b and y ions. The observation of these ions is not surprising, given the high abundances of [Peptide+84] and [Peptide+204] ions in the MS/MS spectra of glycopeptides. Also, the [y or b+203] ions have demonstrated utility in locating glycosylation sites by MS/MS of [Peptide+204] precursors.5, 7\n",

According to the list presented in the Experimental section, other glycoproteins in the mixtures should have been identified. Possible explanations for the absence of their glycopeptides from the MALDI mass spectra include incomplete tryptic digestion or generation of tryptic glycopeptides outside the mass range considered in this study, discrimination in ionization efficiency due to coelution of several peptides/glycopeptides in single HPLC fractions, inability to distinguish glycopeptide from peptide signals in some fractions, etc. For example, hen ovalbumin, which is well known to be N\u2010glycosylated, was not detected as part of this glycomics analysis. Inspection of the sequence of hen ovalbumin reveals that the smallest possible glycosylated peptide has a mass of 3293 Da (291\u2013322, YNLTSVLMAMGITDVFSSSANLSGISSAESLK) without counting the glycan portion. The addition of a small hypothetical biantennary glycan would bring the mass to above 5000 Da, i.e. beyond the limit of our range of observation in this study. Bovine fetuin is another glycoprotein which in theory should have been readily identified. Only two predicted tryptic peptides from this protein with consensus sequence NXS are within the range of our study once sugars are included, 145\u2013159 (LCPDCPLLAPLNDSR, 1740 u, alkylated) and 160\u2013187 (VVHAVEVALATFNAESNGSYLQLVEISR, 3016 u).

The identification of all proteins and glycoproteins in similar mixtures was performed previously without making use of glycopeptide signals,17, 18 which become useful when information on glycosylation is required. Here, precursor ions were chosen arbitrarily for MS/MS analysis based on easy visual recognition of glycosylated patterns. Identification of six peptides from four glycoproteins was achieved using an automatic \u2018SonarMS/MS\u2019 search. The corresponding scores are indicated in the fourth column of Table 1. At present, our laboratory is working on developing an algorithm to recognize the presence of glycopeptide ions through their characteristic mass differences (162, 203, 291 u) and to flag such ions for further MS/MS work. This automated process will surely increase the number of glycopeptides found and broaden the scope of proteomics analyses by including glycosylation data.",

The other source of mass loss of 17 u was observed for CGLVPVLAENYNK, also from human transferrin, where cysteine at the N\u2010terminal was alkylated with iodoacetamide and converted into 5\u2010oxo\u2010thiomorpholine\u20103\u2010carboxylic acid in a manner similar to N\u2010terminal Gln.22 Figure 6 shows the m/z 4000\u20135000 portions of the MALDI spectra obtained for fractions 76, 77 and 78 of a separation of the digested mixture.
