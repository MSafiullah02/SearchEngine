Expansion into a larger cohort at other institutions is an essential next step in developing a final algorithm for use in pediatric disasters. Inclusion of cardiac and neonatal ICU patients will also be necessary to account for all ICU resources needed throughout a hospital. We limited covariates to those available in VPS, but predictive accuracy may be increased with inclusion of additional factors such as preexisting comorbidities or medical complexity, prior admission data, or prehospital resuscitation received. Additionally, we developed models using an a priori-determined systematic process for addition of covariates and variable transformation, but a machine-learning approach may allow more precise model development by allowing an algorithm to test all possible variable combinations to determine the best-fitting model. Finally, use of existing scores limits the flexibility of the models and limited our evaluation of the PIM and PRISM scores to their standard time of calculation at 1 and 12 hours postadmission, respectively; a modified score less reliant on laboratory values may have more utility in prehospital or emergency department settings.",
