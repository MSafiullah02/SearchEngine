The authors conducted rigorous public health surveys, contact tracking and serial SARSCoV-2 testing. In their research, despite specimens testing positive 18 days after diagnosis, no SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred among 10 high-risk contacts of this patient, including 1 intimate contact. This study provided important insights for the spread of COVID-19. However, they promoted the possibility that mild cases can be released from isolation based on symptom resolution.",

There are individual differences in the symptoms of the infectious disease, and the symptoms are often subjective and constantly changing, so it may be difficult to accurately define the severity of the symptoms in clinical practice. It is also difficult to distinguish patients with prodromal symptoms (with subsequent progression) from mild symptoms patients. In a recent article published in MMWR on April 1, a team from the National Centre for Communicable Diseases in Singapore reported seven clusters of cases in which presymptomatic transmission is the most likely explanation for the occurrence of secondary cases [5] . Similar cluster infections caused by presymptomatic infectors have been reported in other areas [6] . In addition, the proportion of asymptomatic patients among all patients may be higher than previously expected, with recent reports suggested a range of 30%-60% [7] .The huge number of asymptomatic infected individuals makes their role in the spread of SARSCoV-2 cannot be ignored.",
