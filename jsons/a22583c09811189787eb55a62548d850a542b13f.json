            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infects types I and II pneumocytes via its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 which is also the main receptor for SARS-CoV [1, 5, 6] . Under healthy circumstances, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is made up of predominantly alveolar macrophages (<80%) and lymphocytes (~10-20%) [7] . Alveolar macrophages police the lungs for pathogens, eliminate senescent cells, engage in reparation of damaged tissue and enhance T-cell specific responses [8] . In addition, macrophages also facilitate neutrophil recruitment which contributes to pathogen clearance and further attraction of inflammatory cells [9, 10] . Some coronaviruses including MERS-CoV [11] , SARS-CoV [12] , HCoV-229E [13] and HCoV-OC43 [14] can infect human macrophages and induce pro-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inflammatory cytokine secretion. Although ACE2 in pulmonary tissues is expressed mainly by type I and II pneumocytes [15] , not only alveolar macrophages, but also tissueresident CD169 + macrophages in spleens and lymph nodes, can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [16] [17] [18] . Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 results in hyper-activation of lung macrophages as well as massive infiltration of pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) into small airways [19, 20] . In lethal SARS-CoV infection of mice, disease progression depends on infiltration to the lungs of monocytes which produce interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [21] . Acute macrophage activation initiates a massive pro-inflammatory response including IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 which mediate the recruitment of neutrophils and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells into the lungs mucosal tissues [9] . Transcriptomic analysis, in addition to cytokine quantification in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from SARS-CoV-2 patients demonstrate tremendous amounts of various cytokines, chemokines and soluble inflammatory mediators including tumor TNF-\u03b1, I)-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2R, IL-8, inducible protein (IP)-10, C-reactive protein and D-dimer [22, 23] , which culminates in a cytokine storm. In contrast to SARS-CoV, which is believed to elicit suboptimal interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 activates expression of many IFNinducible genes having increased capacity for pathogenesis. Moreover, genes implicated in inflammation are overrepresented [24] . Furthermore, increased expression of chemokines critical for recruiting neutrophils (CXCL17) and monocytes (CCL2, CCL7) into the lungs is observed [24] .",

Moreover, CBD was able to directly suppress T-cell secretion of IL-1 and IFN\u03b3 [45] . In piglets with hypoxic-ischemic lung damage, CBD reduced histologic damage, decreased leukocyte infiltration and modulated IL-1 concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [46] , while in a rat model of sepsis, CBD reversed oxidative stress and reduced mortality [47] . In humans, cannabinoid use prevented induction of pro-inflammatory CD16 + monocytes and production of IP-10, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects in humans [48] . In another human study, in addition to reduction of pro-inflammatory monocytes, heavy cannabis use was also associated with decreased frequencies of HLA-DR + CD38 + activated CD4 and CD8 T-cells and frequencies of IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 -producing antigen presenting cells compared to non-cannabis users [49] .

In this regard, first a deeper understanding of the specific effects of SARS-CoV2 on macrophages differentiation, polarization, physiology and immunological functions is needed.

During his first postdoctoral training he furthered his expertise in \"HIV fundamental Immunology\" at INSERM U955 in Paris. He also performed a second postdoctoral fellow at Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, in \"HIV clinical Immunology\". His laboratory is now focused on pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immunity during HIV infection as well as accelerated aging in people living with HIV. Furthermore, his lab is also studying the anti-inflammatory properties of cannabinoids.",
