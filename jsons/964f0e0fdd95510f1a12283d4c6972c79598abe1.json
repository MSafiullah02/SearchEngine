The 166 expression levels of ACE2 was not different compared to healthy controls but the levels of 167 TMPRSS2 (P=0.0002) were significantly higher ( Figure S2A ). This pattern of expression 168 was reversed in the blood of asthmatics, where ACE2 expression was significantly elevated 169 but no difference in the levels of TMPRSS2 was observed ( Figure S1B ).

In fact, by analyzing 7375 contacts, Zhang et al found that 233 children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults. 15 Therefore, the reduced 234 airway tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 reported here may contribute to the lower 235 the risk of infection, 14, 15 and the reduced disease severity observed in the younger population. 236237In light of the potentially increased transmissibility of SARS-Cov-2 in smokers and adults 238 with other comorbidities, 10, 19, 20 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 lung airway expression was found to 239 be upregulated upon smoking and in COPD patients, and slightly increased in asthmatics. Of 240all the chronic lung diseases tested, smokers and COPD had the highest increase in these 241 genes compared to healthy lung tissue. This indicated that smoking could be the reason 242 behind the increased expression observed in COPD, and not the inflammatory mediators. In 243 fact, while preparing this manuscript, Brake et al. reported an increase in ACE2 in the lung 244 airways of smokers using immunohistochemistry. 21 Hypoxia is known to regulate ACE2 245 expression 18, 22 which could explain the mechanism by which smoking increase these 246 receptors. The increased expression of ACE2 in smokers may, hence, justify the observed 247 increase in rate of infection and severity of disease observed in smokers compared to non-248 smokers. 23 249250No difference in receptors gene expression was observed in lung tissue of patients with 251",

It is worth mentioning that serine protease inhibitors such as 274 camostat mesylate which blocks TMPRSS2 activity could be used for treatment of SARS-275CoV-2-infected patients, 6, 26 or as a preventive approach especially for patients identified as 276 high risk based on ACE2 nasal screening. 277Of note, infecting human airway epithelial cells with SARS-CoV was found to downregulate 278 ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared to the mock-infected cells. This was in line with 279 a previous similar observation.6, 27  The fact that the level of expression of ACE2 is not 280 increased following infection indicate that the baseline level of ACE2 may play a critical role 281 in determining the level of diseases severity. Moreover, a dramatic decrease in lung tissue 282 expression of ACE2 was shown to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome 283 (ARDS).28  The downregulation of ACE2 expression observed with SARS-CoV infection, 284 would, hence, play a role in the development of ARDS, a common clinical phenotype for 285 patients with COVID-19. 286287Our results are mainly based on public gene expression datasets. It is warrant that further 288 histological methods and protein validation are performed to confirm our findings.
