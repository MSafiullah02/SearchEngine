            "text": "The usage of digital media to provide learning content is becoming increasingly popular. One form of e-learning is the Flipped Classroom (FC). FC courses, however, are still heavily dependent on the commitment of individual teachers. Repeatable descriptions of approaches or institutionalized support are rare. The high amount of work involved discourages many teachers from using FCs. Strategic course development should therefore be conducted collaboratively by several stakeholders. Change management approaches offer a solution to deal with the integration of strategies for change and consider all stakeholder groups. This paper aims to combine an FC process model and a change management approach to include all stakeholders. Based on a literature review, we develop an integrative approach and summarize the necessary aspects of change.",

            "text": "The practice of teaching has undergone fundamental changes. The integration of technology for the supply of content and learning material leads to improved e-learning variants [1] . One method of so-called blended learning (BL) is the Flipped Classroom (FC). In an FC, the essential basic knowledge is supplied via online material and can be learned at home, while the in-class time can be used to train deeper understanding and application of the knowledge [2] . As the concept is rather new, much research only deals with siloed -and therefore, often heterogeneous case presentations [3] . Process models that present the development process are rare [4, 5] . Often, the FC is planned and proceeded single-handedly by the teachers. Supportive institutional structures are hardly ever available. The transformation of a traditional course is a time-consuming task [6] in which the teacher should be supported by a clear division of roles and tasks. The high amount of work involved discourages many teachers from using technologyenhanced approaches for teaching [7] . The role of the institution and its supporting duties are not defined [8] . Newly created FC design models fall too short, as they assume a high intrinsic motivation of all stakeholders. However, research has already proven a resistance to change among students, teachers, and administration [9] . Change management (CM) that accompanies stakeholders and directs the change is often missing [10] . Due to the defined lack of applicable process models that include stakeholders and motivational structure, this paper links an FC process model with a CM approach. The aim is to present the possible connections between FC development and CM integration. Doing so, we will answer the following three research questions (RQ): (1) Which CM approaches are considered in the current FC literature? (2) What tasks and recommendations to change, referred to as CM aspects, can be identified and linked to the FC development process? (3) What other CM aspects should be taken into account in a stakeholder-integrating FC development process in the future?",

We define how a successful CM can support the FC development process and foster the distribution of the tasks arising. Also, we emphasize which aspects cannot be directly assigned to the development process, but should nevertheless be considered in the sense of a successful change process. To achieve this, we have conducted a research process based on a systematic literature review described in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we will present the theoretical basis: The selected FC process model [11] as well as the underlying CM model from Kotter [12] . We then link the CM aspects derived from the literature review with both models in Sect. 4 and discuss supplementary aspects without direct reference to the FC development process in Sect. 5. Further research and limitations of our work are also covered in the section. The paper ends with a conclusion in Sect. 6. We regard the paper as a wake-up call for higher education institutions (HEI) to recognize the importance of a fundamental and managed change, involving all stakeholders, providing support and structure, and breaking down barriers.",

We searched in six databases using the search string and limiting the results from 2015 to get only current sources. After deducting duplicates in the first exclusion, we identified 282 articles of which title, abstract, and keywords were screened for relevance. Reasons for the second exclusion were a lack of relevance to CM and FC or at least BL and a lack of quality when the source was not published as a journal or conference paper. We selected 57 articles for full-text reading rejecting 50 of them during the third exclusion which we carried out taking into account the criterion lack of relevance to CM and FC/BL, lack of relevance for HEI as well as lack of application of a CM approach. Afterward, we conducted a backward/forward research determining one more article as relevant for our study. Our findings are summarized in Table 1 , in which the CM approach, the mainly addressed stakeholder (Ad. ST) and the primary goals of the paper are noticed. ",

This also corresponds to the results of other researchers for FC [17] and blended learning [18, 21] . In three of the eight articles, the well-known CM approach of Kotter was chosen. Most of the articles shown in Table 1 address the institution as a whole or at least teachers and further staff. We assume that an institutional anchoring and a distribution of tasks to clearly defined roles within the institution is needed. To identify such tasks, as well as recommendations to change, that should be considered in the FC development process, we continue to proceed our research as follows in this paper: First, we describe the FC creation process on the one hand and the CM process on the other hand. Therefore, we merge the FC process model [11] and Kotter's CM model [12] , as Kotter's approach is the only one that is used in several included articles. The chosen models build the basis for assigning CM aspects derived out of the eight papers from the underlying literature review. To do so, we screened the articles for relevant CM aspects. We collected a total of 79 CM aspects, discussed the content within our team of three experienced FC researchers and assigned the aspects to the CTs of the FC process model as well as the steps of Kotter's CM model whenever possible. Doing so, we could link 46 CM aspects with both models (Sect. 4). 33 CM aspects could not be assigned to single CTs of the FC process. They were as well discussed within the team and clustered (Sect. 5).",

Many studies prove the success of FC concepts [9] . Videos, podcasts, and reading assignments provide basic knowledge, which is studied individually by the students online [22] . The attendance time of the FC is arranged differently according to the needs; the main focus is on the application of the knowledge imparted online, problemoriented and collaborative learning as well as discussions between the students and the teacher [23] . The implementation of the FC courses is heterogeneous and scientific findings, therefore, challenging to transfer. Many researchers and users in this field wish for uniform procedure models for the creation of FC courses [24] . First models for FC design came up, which primarily concentrate on content creation [4] and student learning [25] . Table 2 . FC process model checklist [11] Phase",

A supplementary checklist with CTs for each phase is shown in Table 2 . During the initiation phase, the idea of the project comes up and has to be evaluated. Risks and impacts are considered for preparing the decision about the project execution. In the second phase, the planning, required resources are identified and plans for time, costs, and performance are developed. The third phase is often presented in two sections (testing and execution). Here the FC takes place. The closing phase includes an evaluation of the project and its output.

The phase includes all process steps from the first idea to the decision for or against the FC and the communication of the vision of the FC class (CT 1-4). Implementing CM is particularly crucial at the beginning of the FC development; Most of the CTs are closely linked to one or more steps of Kotter's CM model. At the very beginning, goals and needs for an FC (CT 1) have to be defined, which corresponds directly with the task to generate necessity for digital transformation in classrooms (step 1). The initiators should explain and justify the change [14] to all affected stakeholders at an early stage. Existing problems in teaching should be discussed in retrospect, and the need didactical change should be demonstrated [18, 20] . It is important to create awareness for the usefulness of the learning system, including the voices of industry leaders [16] . By creation an induction experience that allowed students to self-assess their needs and undertake development as required before the beginning of a course, teachers can motivate students for the FC [18] . The estimation of time, staff and expenses (CT 2) can be linked to Kotter's first step as well. From a CM perspective (step 1), Berglund et al. [14] recommend the establishment of pedagogical developers (PDs); Highly motivated teachers who work part-time as PDs to promote pedagogical development and facilitate cooperation and knowledge exchange among Table 3 . Linking CM aspects with FC and CM model faculty members at the HEI [18] . The identification of all affected stakeholders (CT 3) can be linked to the first, second and fifth CM step. The FC initiators should demonstrate the benefits of FC teaching clearly and ensure teachers that support and training will be available for them and all other affected stakeholders (step 1) [16] . It is crucial to involve the relevant stakeholders for the FC transformation from an early stage. A guiding coalition should be formed, including not only teachers, students and administration but also technical support, faculty development leader and curricula designers (step 2) [17] . When involving the stakeholders, their diversity must be considered: Van Twembeke et al. found out, that teachers often feel frustrated when basic accomplishments were overlooked and not valued, especially because skills that seem self-evident for younger teachers might be hard to master for older or less digital literate teachers (step 5) [19] .",

Concerning the CTs, this phase is the most extensive. First, the project team must be activated (CT 5). Together they agree on an action plan, that can be subsequently adapted into a project management document, as a BL agreement (step 1) [18] . To connect a powerful stakeholder coalition (step 2) interdisciplinary networking should be promoted within and outside of the institution [10, 19] and connections should be formed between lecturers to share and extend knowledge and best practices [19, 20] . It can help to organize workshops to create and inform the stakeholders about the FC vision [18] (step 4). Also, peer-to-peer interaction is useful [19] . Peer assessment activities through platforms and peerreflection about teaching and learning concepts and implementations between teachers have been proven beneficial for the change process [18] (step 4). To transplant the vision of the FC approach (step 5), regular meetings of involved stakeholders should be held at the institution [19] to exchange ideas, feedback, and knowledge. Furthermore, White et al. motivate stakeholders to overcome barriers (step 5) by constantly communicating \"why\" and \"how\" FCs should be implemented and point out the advantages and possible applications of FC methods [20] . To support teachers while planning and executing the FC (step 6), the institution can provide shared workspaces, where teachers can prepare new materials and have access to books and materials supporting technology-enhanced teaching [19] .",

The consideration of the diversity of the students is a key to enable the overcoming of potential barriers (step 6) [19] . Now the focus is on involving the students. They should be informed in advance about the course and the requirements (CT 10). This also includes explaining the benefits of the course. In concrete terms, former students or practitioners can advertise and explain the benefits of the classes for their future careers [18] . The course can be advertised with these strong stakeholder alliances (step 2). Students are informed comprehensively through different channels [17] (step 4) and the information about the course is provided [18] . This step also serves to overcome potential barriers (step 5).

(2) Encourage teams: Create a sense of community [14] and promote the presence of the guiding coalition [19] . (3) Live the vision: Create and use a vision [20] that gets a proper name and is distributed across different communication channels [18] . Consider an FC establishment from bottom-up [19] , set and communicate goals [20] , use motivational techniques [18] and activate committed stakeholders [10] .

Concentrate on established technological tools [16] and support voluntary participation of teachers [15] . (5) Enable step-by-step procedure: Implement FC step-by-step [20] by starting small, flipping one lecture at a time, executing pilots and preparing subareas [17] . Set intermediate goals [19] , evaluate the progress [16] communicate the first results [18] , and employ feedback loops [16] .

The integration of CM to an FC process model is of particular relevance for researchers from the fields of elearning, instructional design, CM, and Process Management, especially in HEI. For further research we would welcome reports about FC development projects, that rely on our findings. Furthermore, stakeholder specific action plans should be developed and tested.
