An interesting line of modeling has developed, aiming at including explicitly the effect of activity distributions on network dynamics: activity-driven networks [10] . In activity-driven models, each agent is endowed with a degree of freedom that encodes the propensity of the individual to engage in a social event, establishing a link with another agent in the system. Notably, measured activities are typically highly heterogeneous and this has strong effects on network evolution.",

            "text": "When links are randomly established among agents, activity-driven models have been studied in detail [10] [11] [12] [13] , uncovering the effects of heterogeneous activity distributions on network topology and on dynamical processes, such as random walks and epidemic processes. However, in general, agents do not connect randomly to their peers [14] [15] [16] . During their activity, individuals remember their friends and their social circles and they are more inclined to interact with already known pals, establishing strong and weak ties with their peers [17, 18] . Recent works have tackled this problem by applying a data-driven approach. A tie allocation mechanism in real systems has been measured, introducing a memory process on top of activity-driven models [19, 20] . As reasonably expected, social interactions are not randomly established but they are rather concentrated towards already contacted nodes, with a reinforcement process encoded in a single measurable memory parameter. The memory process tunes the network evolution, which can be predicted at large times [21] [22] [23] , and it is also expected to influence dynamical processes. Non-Markovian dynamics can indeed change the spreading rate in a diffusion process, slowing it down in some cases and speeding it up in others [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Disparate effects have been shown to occur also in epidemic spreading on activity-driven networks, where memory can lower or increase the epidemic threshold in the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) or susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, respectively [31] . This happens when the epidemic process and the network evolution start at the same time. However, the network evolution in the presence of non-Markovian effects could introduce aging in the process [32] , as usually observed in processes with memory also in other fields [33] , and this could further influence the spreading dynamics.",

The result shows that memory overall reinforces the effects of activity fluctuations, leading to a lower value for the epidemic threshold. We prove that the ABMF approximation is equivalent to an epidemic model defined on an effective static network, which we also investigate. Numerical simulations evidence that the ABMF approach provides exact results when the epidemics start after the network has evolved for a long time. In this regime indeed the mean field holds since agents have been connected to a large number of pairs, while the creation of new links becomes negligible.",

On the other hand, for strong memory, at short times the dynamics displays correlations among infection probabilities of nodes which have already been in contact. The correlations give rise to backtracking effects that cannot be ignored. In this case, typically the threshold of the SIS and SIR models are respectively smaller and larger with respect to the mean-field prediction.

We will call A ij (t ) the adjacency matrix of this integrated network. The parameter \u03b2 i > 0 tunes the memory process. For \u03b2 i \u2248 0 the probability p[k i (t )] \u2248 1 weakly depends on the growing degree k i (t ), while at large \u03b2 i , p[k i (t )] rapidly decays with k i (t ).

Empirical measures on several data sets [21] are compatible with constant values of \u03b2 i = \u03b2 and c i = c, so the function p(\u00b7) turns out to be independent of i. In particular, the exponent \u03b2 ranges from \u03b2 \u2248 0.15 in the citation networks to \u03b2 \u2248 0.5 in Twitter mentions and to \u03b2 \u2248 1.2 in the mobile phone calls.

The description in terms of quantities that only depend on the activity is conceptually analogous to the heterogeneous mean-field approach for dynamical processes on static networks [35] . In that case, one assumes that the only property determining the epidemic state of a node is the degree k and then derives equations for the probabilities \u03c1 k . An important difference must however be stressed. Assuming the epidemic state to depend only on the degree is an approximation for static networks, because it neglects the quenched nature of the network structure that makes properties of nodes, with the same degree but embedded in different local environments, different. In practice, this assumption is equivalent to replacing the actual adjacency matrix of the network (A ij equal to 0 or 1 depending on the presence of the connection between v i and v j ) with an annealed adjacency matrix P ij = k i k j /( k N ) [36] , expressing the probability that vertices v i and v j with degree k i and k j are connected. The annealed approach is an approximation for static networks, while it is exact for networks where connections are continuously reshuffled at each time step of the dynamics, since the reshuffling process destroys local correlations. Since in memoryless activitydriven networks connections are extracted anew at each time step, the ABMF approach provides exact results in this case.",

If the epidemic starts at very large times, therefore, we can apply an heterogeneous mean-field approximation for A ij (t ), allowing for an analytical solution of the problem which we expect to be asymptotically exact.",

The effect can be simply understood since nodes with large activity have also a large degree, therefore they are easily involved in epidemic contacts not only because they are frequently activated but also because they are frequently contacted by other nodes. In this way memory reinforces the effect of activity fluctuations.

The memory process leads to the formation of small clusters of mutually connected high activity vertices, which become reservoirs of the disease in the SIS model. The high frequency of mutual contacts allows for reinfection, favoring the overall survival of the epidemic spreading in the system. In this way, social circles with high activity play a role analogous to that played by the maximum K-core or the hub and its immediate neighbors for SIS epidemics in static networks [38, 39] . To clarify the effect of dynamical correlations at finite time, in the next section we compare the analytical predictions with the results of numerical simulations. As a final remark, we note that, in the asymptotic ABMF approach, the linear stability analysis also holds for the SIR model, implying that the epidemic threshold is the same of the SIS model. However, in the SIR model reinfection is not allowed, so the initial presence of small clusters of mutually connected high activity vertices effectively inhibits the spread of the disease. For this reason, we expect that finite connectivity (i.e., finite time) increases the epidemic threshold with respect to the mean-field result, as we will check in numerical simulations.",

However, we expect that for large enough k 0 , at any \u03b2 > 0, the dynamics is dominated by memory and infections spread on the effective static network recovering the ABMF result.

As for SIS, at large k 0 dynamical correlations can be neglected and simulations recover the ABMF result. Simulations clearly show that now correlations at small k 0 inhibit the epidemic spreading and the critical threshold becomes larger. As in the SIS model, at small \u03b2 the memory is negligible and the dynamics is driven by the creation of new links, so the threshold values are close to the memoryless case, even if for any \u03b2 > 0 we expect for large enough k 0 a convergence to the ABMF prediction. On the other hand, for larger \u03b2, the epidemics evolve on the integrated network, dynamical correlations become important, and the thresholds grow even larger than in the memoryless case.",

The time when the epidemic process begins has crucial consequences. In the long-time limit the reinforcement mechanism of the topological evolution completely inhibits the formation of new connections. If the activity-driven epidemic dynamics starts at this stage, it takes place on a topology which is in practice static. All nodes have a very large number of connections and this makes mean-field theory asymptotically exact. The epidemic threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, is reduced with respect to the memoryless case, because memory enhances the effect of activity fluctuations.",

The fundamental observation is that at this stage nodes with large activity tend to interact with their social circles, while less active nodes still tend to explore the system creating new connections. The first type of interaction tends to enhance SIS spreading, while the second tends to suppress it. This leads to positive or negative corrections to the asymptotic value of the threshold, depending on the initial conditions and on the reinforcement parameter \u03b2. In the SIR case instead, since reinfection is not possible, the interaction within social circles is strongly detrimental for the epidemic propagation, so the asymptotic value of the threshold is always reached from above. Our results allow us to fully understand the contrasting effects of strong ties on SIS and SIR dynamics observed in Ref. [31] and it offers different possibilities in control of epidemic spreading on temporal networks with high correlations.",

To study the stability of the system linearized around the fixed point \u03c1(a) = 0, we introduce the functions \u03c1 = \u03c1(a) , x = g(a)\u03c1(a) , y = A(a)\u03c1(a) , z = A(a)g(a)\u03c1(a) . (A2) Integrating Eq. (A1) over a and keeping only linear terms in \u03c1(a), we obtain an equation for \u2202 t \u03c1. Similarly, multiplying Eq. (A1) by g(a) and integrating over a we get an equation for \u2202 t x. Doing the same for y and z, we obtain a closed system of four equations for four variables \u2202 t \u03c1 = \u2212\u03bc\u03c1 + \u03bb[ A(a)g(a) \u03c1 + A(a) x + g(a) y + z], \u2202 t x = \u2212\u03bcx + \u03bb[ A(a)g 2 (a) \u03c1 + A(a)g(a) x + g 2 (a) y + g(a) z], \u2202 t y = \u2212\u03bcy + \u03bb[ A 2 (a)g(a) \u03c1 + A 2 (a) x + A(a)g(a) y + A(a) z], \u2202 t z = \u2212\u03bcz + \u03bb[ A 2 (a)g 2 (a) \u03c1 + A 2 (a)g(a) x + A(a)g 2 (a) y + A(a)g(a) z].
