Better sleep quality and stress reduction could be one justification for prescribing hypnotics to COVID-19 patients. That is, hypnotics could help a patient to overcome difficult and prolonged hospitalization (about 2 to 3 weeks), resulting in improved survival and recovery. Dimitrov and colleagues indicated that sleep can exert some immune-supportive effects and potentially enhance effective T-cell responses. 22 In addition, the superior efficacy of dexzopiclone may be due to enhanced gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling. That is, dexzopiclone can interact with GABAA, and GABAA receptor can magnify responses to GABA. 23 GABA signaling promotes autophagy activation, which improves phagosome maturation and promotes host protection against infections. 24 The beneficial effect of hypnotics on COVID-19 clinical outcomes warrants further investigation in the management of COVID-19 patients.",

Moreover, the high false-negativity of RT-PCR (about 20-40%) 26 presents a significant burden on health care providers to use their clinical judgment. And chest CT has a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 than RT-PCR. 26 Several underlying reasons, including uneven sensitivities of different detection kits, improper collection of throat swab specimens, and low concentration of virus in samples 27 can lead to the possible deviation in test results.

Increased troponin can enhance coagulation activation. 34 In patients with COVID-19, immune damage to the hematopoietic system, ischemic hypoxia-reperfusion injury, and drugs can cause coagulation disorders. 8, [34] [35] [36] [37] We speculate that increased troponin will induce dysfunction of coagulation and thrombus formation with possible pulmonary embolism, which would further aggravate the patient's condition. D-dimer was found to be very significantly different according to the disease-severity status, and a higher proportion of patients with severe (50.7%) and critical (57.1%) disease had D-dimer levels >0.5 mg/L, which is consistent with other studies 10,12 . However, in terms of clinical outcomes, even though the patients with unfavorable outcomes had higher percentage (51.9%) of D-dimer >0.5 mg/L than the patients (40.4%) with favorable outcomes, the difference was not statistically significant.",
