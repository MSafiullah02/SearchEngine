In 2016, more than 3 billion people were reportedly at risk of infection, with an estimated 200 million cases and more than 400,000 deaths, primarily in young children living in sub-Saharan Africa1. Development of a malaria vaccine of high efficacy is considered a critical global agenda towards the achievement of malaria control and elimination. However, this progress has been greatly hampered by antigen polymorphism and low efficacy among target antigens2,3. Relatively conserved antigens that induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses may provide long lasting and more efficacious protection4\u20138. It is also suggested that the next generation vaccines should incorporate multi-stage and/or multivalent targets aimed at inducing both humoral and cellular immunity9.",

            "text": "The process of merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, that marks the beginning of the blood stage cycle of P. falciparum infections, takes less than 2 min and is characterized by dynamic molecular and cellular events10\u201312. Upon egress from the infected erythrocyte the merozoite is exposed to low potassium levels which trigger intracellular calcium release. The release activates secretion of adhesins and invasins, localized in the micronemes, onto the parasite surface13\u201315. Following the initial recognition of the host erythrocyte the parasite orients itself so that its apical end is directly facing the target erythrocyte membrane. The rhoptries are subsequently triggered to release invasion ligands that interact with erythrocyte receptors16,17. Irreversible attachment of merozoites to erythrocytes then occurs through formation of an electron-dense nexus between the host and parasite membranes, termed a tight junction and composed primarily of PfAMA1 and RON complex proteins15. The nexus opens out into a ring-like moving junction, which envelops the merozoite, finally resealing behind it, such that the parasite is completely internalized within an intracellular parasitophorous vacuole18. Upon successful invasion echinocytosis occurs, most likely caused by entry of Ca2+ into the erythrocyte, resulting in shrinkage of the infected erythrocyte10,11. Because at the blood stage cycle the merozoites are exposed to various host immune responses, albeit for a short period between host cell egress and invasion, it is considered an ideal target for vaccine development12,16.",

            "text": "Investigations towards receptor-ligand interactions during merozoite invasion suggest that, in addition to merozoite surface proteins (MSPs), two protein ligand families play key roles prior to tight junction formation; namely, P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologs (PfRhs) and erythrocyte-binding like proteins (EBLs)11,18,19. The PfRhs include PfRh1, PfRh2a, PfRh2b, PfRh3, PfRh4, and Rh5. Rh5, the smallest member of the PfRhs, is localized within the merozoite rhoptries where it relocates to the moving junction during invasion20. Unlike genes encoding other PfRhs and EBLs, although functionally important, only the gene encoding Rh5 (PF3D7_0424100) is refractory to targeted gene deletion21,22. These reports suggest that the protein plays a crucial role in parasite survival, and this is supported functionally by confirmed binding to basigin on erythrocytes23. In addition, Rh5 forms a complex with P. falciparum Rh5-interacting protein (PfRipr)24,25 and cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA)5,26. Rh5, CyRPA, and PfRipr are now considered to be promising blood-stage vaccine candidates5\u20137,24,26,27, since the PfRipr/CyRPA/Rh5 complex plays a central role in the sequential molecular events leading to merozoite invasion and the genes have limited sequence polymorphism in P. falciparum5,27,28.",

PfRipr is a 126-kDa protein which localizes to the merozoite micronemes and contains ten epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains that are processed into two polypeptides. The processed 65-kDa PfRipr pair, which remains associated with Rh5 and CyRPA, is shed into the supernatant during invasion24,25. Although it is unclear how PfRipr interacts with CyRPA and Rh5, it has been demonstrated that the three proteins elicit invasion-inhibitory antibodies in experimental animals and naturally acquired antibodies in humans associate with protection from clinical malaria5,7,24,26,27,29. Noteworthy, when compared to Rh5 and CyRPA, antibodies against recombinant PfRipr have consistently shown higher in vitro growth inhibition assay (GIA) activity5,7,24,26,27,29,30. However, the mechanism by which anti-PfRipr antibodies induce such high GIA activity remains unknown.",

Additionally, we applied WGCFS and AlphaScreen, a protein-protein based interaction screening system, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to systematically screen for and validate potential receptors of PfRipr on the surface of human erythrocytes. We demonstrated that PfRipr directly interacts with recombinant proteins of three erythrocyte surface proteins. Antibodies to a region within the PfRipr C-terminal EGF-like domains inhibited merozoite invasion and PfRipr association with Rh5 and SEMA7A. Taken together, the identified PfRipr region represents a promising candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.",

First, we generated transgenic parasite lines expressing full-length PfRipr (M1-N1086) with a C-terminal 3 \u00d7 HA tag (PfRipr-HA). In vivo PfRipr-HA expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), showing co-localization with AMA1 in the micronemes suggesting native PfRipr localization (Fig. 4a). We further observed that anti HA-tag could immunoprecipitate basigin and Rh5 (Fig. S4a). Since studies have indicated that culture supernatants can be a source of parasite proteins that bind host erythrocytes35, we used culture supernatants of the transgenic parasites to further confirm successful expression and release of PfRipr-HA into the culture supernatant (Fig. 4b). Consistent with the reported size of native PfRipr5,24, signals at approximately 70 and 120 kDa were observed (Fig. 4b). Although an earlier study had suggested that PfRipr is processed, and that the 60\u201370 kDa signal represents a processed C-terminal fragment, a recent study demonstrated that antibodies against the N-terminal and C-terminal EGF like domains of PfRipr detected the two signals, suggesting that the signals are derived from full-length PfRipr5,24 and the 70-kDa signal might be due to multiple disulfide bonds in PfRipr despite reducing conditions. The ratio of the 2 signals varied in each preparation of the SDS-PAGE sample even from same culture supernatant or parasite lysate (data not shown).",

Taken together, the data presented here suggest that antibodies to PfRipr_5 block invasion by potentially inhibiting PfRipr/Rh5 interaction, as well as that between PfRipr and its novel erythrocyte-surface receptor SEMA7A. PfRipr_5 therefore offers an ideal target for further evaluation as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.",

            "text": "Invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum merozoites is a fundamental step in malaria pathogenesis and therefore a primary target for vaccine development16,41. Understanding biochemical interactions is key to identifying the role of proteins involved in the invasion process. One protein of particular interest is PfRipr, a leading subunit vaccine candidate and a vital protein in erythrocyte invasion5,25,30,42. We recently determined that PfRipr is highly conserved among African isolates, with the region spanning C720-D934 (PfRipr_5) having only a single amino acid substitution at E829Q30. The PfRipr/CyRPA/Rh5-basigin complex is suggested to play a central role in the sequential molecular events leading to merozoite invasion25. We and others have further demonstrated that specific antibodies raised against recombinant PfRipr exhibit strain-transcending inhibition of P. falciparum in vitro growth25,30. However, it is not understood how Rh5 and CyRPA interact with PfRipr, and how anti-PfRipr antibodies consistently achieve high GIA activity in vitro. Here, we investigated the mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies in inhibiting merozoite invasion. PfRipr, being a 126-kDa protein with 87 cysteine residues, is difficult to express as full-length protein in conventional expression systems. Therefore, we utilized the eukaryotic WGCFS to express PfRipr, which we subsequently subjected to systematic biochemical analyses. We demonstrated that antibodies to a short region of PfRipr (PfRipr_5: C720 - D934) in the C-terminal spanning five EGF-like domains (fifth to ninth EGF-like domains) inhibited merozoite invasion, as well as blocked interaction between PfRipr and its erythrocyte receptors. The GIA potency observed was lower than in a recent study43, an aspect that should be given careful consideration in future studies. Nevertheless, PfRipr_5 is a relatively small region that deserves further evaluation for its candidacy as a blood-stage vaccine antigen.",

            "text": "Previous studies indicated that PfRipr localizes to merozoite micronemes and is released onto the parasite surface during invasion, forming a tripartite complex with Rh5 and CyRPA25. The complex is then anchored to the surface of erythrocyte via basigin5,24,44. However, the data presented here is somewhat contradictory to those studies. Specifically, using the AVEXIS assay Galaway et al. did not observe direct interaction between PfRipr/Rh534. Similarly, the Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex structural analysis did not directly show PfRipr/Rh5 binding45. Nonetheless, they did observe that, after binding to basigin, the Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex disassembled to generate an erythrocyte membrane associated Rh5, and PfRipr which migrated as a single band of high molecular weight (about 700 kDa), suggesting that they were in the same complex as oligomers. Based on the latter observation, our report on a PfRipr/Rh5 direct interaction may offer insight to the situational path of the Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex after binding to basigin. Indeed, our EBA studies with episomally expressed PfRipr fused with an HA tag (Fig. 4c) is consistent with previous results showing that PfRipr was present within the erythrocyte membrane pellet45. We further demonstrated that GST-PfRipr binds to the erythrocyte surface and is resistant to chymotrypsin, trypsin, and neuraminidase treatment similar to PfRipr-HA. In this non-traditional EBA, we incubated recombinant GST-PfRipr with erythrocytes, washed, and then hemolyzed the cell with tetanolysin. The erythrocyte ghost was further washed with buffer, mixed with sample buffer and applied onto an SDS-PAGE gel. Thus, using AlphaScreen, we probed for interactions between biotinylated PfRipr ectodomain as bait and GST-fused erythrocyte surface receptors (Fig. 5a,b). Subsequently, analyses by SPR confirmed that PfRipr directly interacts with AMIGO2, SEMA7A, and NPTN (Fig. 5c). In addition, anti-SEMA7A antibody immunoprecipitated recombinant GST-PfRipr suggesting that recombinant PfRipr could bind native SEMA7A (Fig. 5d). Taken together, these findings suggest that PfRipr can function as a parasite ligand. These data need to be further validated since it could mean that (i) the native PfRipr indeed binds to erythrocyte SEMA7A, or (ii) recombinant GST-Ripr protein is structurally dissimilar from native PfRipr, perhaps due to lacking a parasite specific post-translational modification, giving it a different erythrocyte surface binding phenotype.",

In addition, using P. falciparum lines conditionally expressing PfRipr, Volz et al. demonstrated that loss of PfRipr function blocks growth due to the inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes25. Consistent with this, anti-PfRipr antibodies have been known to induce high GIA activity30. The key question is therefore, what is the mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies on parasite growth inhibition? In our study, anti-PfRipr polyclonal antibodies blocked the interaction between PfRipr and Rh5, as well as between PfRipr and a host receptor SEMA7A. It was therefore postulated that the antibody blockage of PfRipr binding to its multiple partners could explain the observed growth inhibition activity. However, we were unable to show a correlation between interaction inhibition in SPR and in vitro parasite GIA. Thus, in future studies we would like to address the mode of inhibition with monoclonal antibodies, as well as validate the in vitro SPR findings by an in vivo protein-protein interaction detection system.",

            "text": "SEMA7A, the John-Milton-Hagen blood group antigen, was recently reported as the receptor for P. falciparum merozoite-specific TRAP homolog, MTRAP46. SEMA7A is a GPI-anchored membrane bound protein expressed on several tissues with diverse functions; however, the functional role of the interaction remains unclear since antibodies to either MTRAP or SEMA7A did not cause inhibition in in vitro parasite invasion assays46. Similarly, our attempts to inhibit merozoite invasion with anti-SEMA7A antibodies showed no GIA activity, possibly due to insufficient antibody molecules which target SEMA7A surfaces important for PfRipr/SEMA7A interactions (Fig. S4c). Another possibility is that the inhibition caused by the anti-PfRipr_5 antibodies may not have been due to inhibition of PfRipr-SEMA7A interaction, but by another unknown mechanism such as anti-PfRipr antibodies inhibiting PfRipr/Rh5 interaction43. Our analysis showed that recombinant PfRipr/SEMA7A interacts at a nM level KD (Fig. 5c); however, we could not immunoprecipitate a native PfRipr/Rh5/SEMA7A complex. This could suggest that the interaction is a \u201cstrong transient complex\u201d and a trigger would be needed for its dissociation47. Indeed, anti-PfRipr_5 antibodies inhibit both PfRipr/Rh5 and PfRipr/SEMA7A interactions (Fig. 6a,b), suggesting that these PfRipr interacting regions are close. Recently, Healer et al. reported that neutralizing anti-PfRipr monoclonal antibody prevents merozoite invasion by not blocking Rh5/CyRPA/PfRipr complex formation but by another mechanism43. Although our results may support an alternative mechanism of blocking ligand-receptor interaction, this model needs confirmation. Still, the KD values determined by SPR with recombinant PfRipr and SAMA7A proteins were low and suggested a high affinity interaction; however, this is generally not the case for natural ligand-receptor interactions which have low affinity adhesion48. To understand the PfRipr/SEMA7A interaction in detail, we may need further analysis for KD values using other methods, for example radioligand binding assays.",

This is of considerable importance since the region was produced in a scalable and good manufacturing practice (GMP) compatible baculovirus-based vaccine production system allowing further vaccine development targeted adjustments. As a short and less complex protein that can be easily synthesized, PfRipr_5 is a potential candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.",
