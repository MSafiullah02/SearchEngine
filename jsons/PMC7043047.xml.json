            "text": "CD4+ T cells are crucial for the generation of vaccine-mediated immune responses providing effective immunity against pathogens. Recent studies have demonstrated that both circulating T memory (TM) cells and tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) abundant in peripheral tissues are central to elicit protective immunity [1, 2]. TRM represent a non-migratory population of TM that is phenotypically different from circulating TM subsets [e.g., T central memory (TCM) and T effector memory (TEM)] and mediate rapid effector immune responses following antigen recall [2]. Human TRM are mainly characterized phenotypically by high expression of CD69, a key marker for distinguishing between circulating and resident TM [3]. Integrin \u03b1E\u03b27 (CD103), the ligand to E-cadherin, is also used to characterize TRM but CD103 expression is mostly confined to CD8+ TRM and a minor subset of CD4+TRM [3\u20136]. Recent studies have characterized CD4+ TRM subsets in multiple organs including lungs, liver, skin, intestines, vagina and lymphoid sites where they provide protective responses and direct the recruitment of immune cells [7\u201310]. In the human intestine, the majority of CD4+TRM are CD69+CD103\u2212 and a minority are CD69+CD103+ [3] but little information is available concerning their role in oral immunization or enteric infections. It is unclear whether live oral attenuated typhoid vaccine, Ty21a, could elicit and generate antigen-specific CD4+TRM responses in the human terminal ileum (TI) (site of infection for S. Typhi).",

            "text": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the etiological agent of typhoid fever, is a human restricted pathogen, that infects around 21 million people globally resulting in approximately to 223,000 deaths yearly [11\u201313]. After actively infecting primarily the TI [14\u201316], S. Typhi disseminate to the systemic organs (e.g., liver, spleen and others) leading to systemic illness [17]. To our knowledge, no information is available on the induction of CD4+TRM responses to S. Typhi in the TI mucosa following wild-type S. Typhi infection or immunization with Ty21a. Since the gastrointestinal track is a major reservoir of CD4+TRM, it is important to understand their role in protective immunity against S. Typhi and other enteric pathogens at their preferred site of natural infection. This knowledge will provide novel insights for the development of tailored mucosal vaccines to enteric pathogens. Currently, there are two licensed typhoid vaccines namely, Ty21a and the parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine [18, 19] and both have their limitations. Following Ty21 immunization, a modest level of long-lived protection (60\u201380%, 5\u20137 years) is obtained [20\u201322] while the Vi vaccine is moderately immunogenic but well tolerated [17, 23]. Therefore, effective vaccines that offer durable, long-lasting protection are urgently needed for children and adults.",

            "text": "Induction of humoral and CMI responses have been thoroughly examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy individuals vaccinated with Ty21a [24\u201330]. These studies demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (e.g., IFN\u03b3, cytotoxic T cells (CTL), proliferation) are induced following Ty21a-vaccination [22, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32]. Moreover, S. Typhi responsive CD4+ T cells are mediated mostly by TEM and RA+TEM (TEMRA) and, to a lesser extent, by TCM [22, 32, 33]. Furthermore, CD4+TEM and TEMRA subsets responses displayed increases in S. Typhi-specific multifunctional (MF) cells post-vaccination mainly producing IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF-\u03b1, while IL-2, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-17A and CD107a expression (a marker associated with cytotoxicity) were produced in a small proportion of MF cells [33]. Recently, we reported that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits significant TI lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) S. Typhi-specific CD8+ TM [34], CD8+TRM [16], and CD4+TM [35] responses with distinct effector functions. However, it is unknown whether LPMC CD4+TRM are elicited following oral Ty21a immunization.",

To test this hypothesis, we determined the cytokine production by LPMC CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM obtained from Ty21a-vaccinated (n = 18) and unvaccinated (n = 18) volunteers following co-culture with autologous S.

Therefore, we hypothesized that Ty21a-immunization might influence the induction of spontaneous cytokines (background responses) and the capacity of CD4+TRM to respond to stimulation. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated CD4+TRM (CD103+ and CD103\u2212) cytokines producing cells when LPMC cells were cultured overnight either alone (unstimulated) or following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/CD28 beads. Cumulative data from unstimulated LPMC show that there were significant (p < 0.05) increase in IFN\u03b3-S (but not IFN\u03b3-MF) producing cells in both CD4+TRM subsets (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, we observed that the baseline level of IFN\u03b3 producing cells by CD103+ CD4+TRM cells were significantly higher than those from CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM as shown by green lines (Fig. 2a). Next, we determined spontaneous IL-17A responses and observed that CD103+ CD4+TRM exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-17A-S following Ty21a-immunization (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we noted that the level of IL-17A (S and MF) were significantly higher in CD103+CD4+TRM than in CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM (Fig. 2b). Similar assessments were made for IL-2 and TNF\u03b1 for background responses (Fig. 2c, d). Interestingly, no differences in either CD4+TRM subset were noted for IL-2 and TNF\u03b1, except for CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM that showed a decreased trend in IL-2-S (Fig. 2c) and an increased trend in TNF\u03b1-S (Fig. 2d) responses following Ty21a-immunization.

To confirm that there were no discrepancies in cell yields, the number of viable IEL per mg of TI tissues obtained from biopsies of Ty21a-vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were compared. No significant differences in cell yields were observed between the two groups (Additional file 6: Fig. S6). Similarly, almost identical cell yields were observed in LPMC between the two groups.

There is growing evidence that TRM (e.g., CD4+TRM) cells play a crucial role in protective immunity following natural infection and their subsequent secondary exposure. However, there are no previous reports on the role of CD4+TRM following oral Ty21a-immunization in the human TI. Here, we examined the responses elicited by Ty21a-immunization on TI LPMC and IEL CD4+TRM subsets. We observed that Ty21a-immunization activated LPMC CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM resulting in increased spontaneous cytokines (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-17A) production. Importantly, LPMC CD4+TRM subsets contributed significantly to S. Typhi-specific IFN\u03b3, IL-17A and IL-2 responses following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets. Moreover, these responses differed in magnitude and characteristics between CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM, suggesting a dichotomy in their contributions and possibly different roles in S. Typhi immunity. Finally, we demonstrated that Ty21a-immunization induces IEL CD4+TRM subsets in the epithelial compartment both spontaneously and following antigen-specific stimulation. Interestingly, IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+ TRM contributed significantly to S. Typhi specific IFN\u03b3, IL-17A and TNF\u03b1 as single producing cells while IEL CD103+CD4+TRM contributed to IL-2 production. Taken together, these results contribute major novel information of the effects of oral Ty21a-vaccination and the role of CD4+TRM in human TI mucosal responses.",

Multiple specialized populations of immune cells (adaptive and innate) including CD4+TRM reside in the intestine and contribute to intestinal \u201chomeostasis\u201d and protective immunity against enteric pathogens. S. Typhi or the attenuated S. Typhi vaccine Ty21a strain can effectively invade the TI mucosa, preferred site of S. Typhi infection [45, 46]. Then, it is reasonable to hypothesize that exposure to S. Typhi elicits both innate and adaptive responses including CD4+TRM in the lamina propria and the epithelial compartments of the TI which might play a significant role in protection against S. Typhi. The complexities involved in obtaining cells from the human terminal ileum biopsies (LPMC and IEL), are likely to have contributed to the lack of information available on CD4+TRM immune responses following oral vaccination. Using this unique model of oral live attenuated Ty21a vaccine in humans, we showed that oral Ty21a-immunization resulted in the spontaneous production of cytokine cells in the LP from CD103+ (IFN\u03b3-S and IL-17A-S) and CD103\u2212 (IFN\u03b3-S and TNF\u03b1-S) CD4+TRM and in the epithelium where IFN\u03b3-S was produced spontaneously from both CD4+TRM subsets. Similar effects (e.g., increase in IFN\u03b3-S and TNF\u03b1-S in both LP and IEL) elicited by Ty21a-immunization were observed following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/CD28 stimulation. We hypothesize that there may be multiple cell subsets within each CD4+TRM subpopulation that differ in their requirements for activation and/or their recognition of specific cognate antigens [47\u201349]. Future studies should focus on fully understanding the heterogeneity and contribution of the resident cells in spontaneous cytokine production following Ty21a-immunization. These cells might play a role in protection, albeit likely to be of lesser importance than those mediated by antigen-specific responses. Overall, these unique data indicate that immunization with bacterial oral vaccines may have immunomodulatory effects beyond those that are specific for the vaccine being administered leading to a generalized level of activation.",

CD4+TRM unlike CD8+TRM are less uniform in their expression of CD103 and consequently two distinct subsets are present in tissues. Here, TI CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM elicited immune responses were evaluated following Ty21a immunization. Our data provided the first evidence of distinct responses between these two subsets in terms of spontaneous secretion of cytokines, stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28, and S. Typhi-specific responses resulting from stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets and Ty21a homogenate antigens. Specifically, our results showed striking differences in terms of the characteristics (IFN\u03b3 and S for CD103+; IL-2 and MF for CD103\u2212) of these responses. Of note, a recent study reported differences in IFN\u03b3 responses between lung CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM following stimulation with \u03b1-CD3/CD28 [7]. Taken together, these results suggest that CD103+CD4+TRM subset (Th1 and Th17) are distinct from CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM subset (Th1) and might play a different role in the mucosa following oral vaccination and/or infection.",

Here, we showed that the IFN\u03b3 and IL-17A are primarily produced by CD4+TRM (a subset of CD4+ TEM) in significantly higher levels in the terminal ileum mucosa following Ty21a immunization. In addition, we observed that CD103+ CD4+TRM produced cytokines as monofunctional cells whereas CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM cells produced mostly multifunctional cytokines, similar to our observations in LPMC CD4+TEM [50]. These results suggest that examination of heterogeneous CD4+ T populations may mask the \u2018true\u2019 impact of oral Ty21a immunization due to the \u2018averaging effect\u2019 inherent to the analyses of whole populations/subsets which are composed of responding and non-responding cells. Thus, it is essential to focus on the fine granularity (e.g., S. Typhi-specific CD103\u2212 or CD103+ TRM subsets, S vs MF) to better characterize the responses and properly study differences between cells in various immune compartments. Here, we demonstrated that oral Ty21a immunization elicited CD4+ TRM subsets in both, the LP and epithelial compartments, involving effector mechanisms (e.g., IL-17A) that might be well suited for protection against intracellular pathogens.",

Typhi-infected targets (moderately efficient CD4+ T stimulation) and Ty21a homogenate antigens (an efficient CD4+ T stimulation) [51] to stimulate CD4+TRM subsets. Remarkably, our results indicate that following stimulation with Ty21a homogenate antigens, LPMC CD103+TRM largely produced significantly higher levels of S. Typhi-specific IFN\u03b3-MF, IL-2-MF and TNF\u03b1-MF in Ty21a vaccinated participants than those in the unvaccinated group. These results were different from those observed following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets (IFN\u03b3-S and IL-17A-S), which largely display S. Typhi antigens in the context of both MHC-I and II molecules. Taken together, these data suggest that LPMC CD4+TRM subsets are versatile in responding to S. Typhi antigens. Of note, we recently described that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD8+TRM [16] and were able to respond following in vitro stimulation with soluble antigens and S. Typhi-infected targets, indicating that multiple effector T cell responses are likely to be concomitantly induced. Future studies focusing on the activation requirements of CD4 and CD8 populations in human tissues would be vital to better understand these phenomena to accelerate the development of mucosal vaccines targeting the induction of CMI.",

The predominant population of IEL-T cells are CD8+T with a minor population of CD4+T cells. IEL are part of the first line of defense and are deemed to be an important cell subset involved in immune responses at mucosal surfaces. Thus, in this study, we hypothesized that CD103+CD4+TRM (CD103 binds to E-cadherin on IEC) located in the LP are poised to migrate to the epithelium and play a consequential role in S. Typhi immunity. We describe, for the first time, that oral Ty21a-immunization influenced the frequencies of IEL-T cells with a significant shift in the proportion of CD4+T to CD8+T cells (significantly lower CD8+ and higher CD4+T cells). Surprisingly, we observed that this increase in frequency of IEL CD4+T cells was chiefly in the IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM subset but not in the CD103+CD4+TRM subset. These data suggest that there may be other receptor-ligand pair(s) (apart from CD103/E-cadherin) involved in the migration of CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM from LP to the epithelial compartment. Alternatively, CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM cells may be more likely to move freely around the epithelium since it does not depend on their interaction with the E-cadherin on epithelial cells. Regarding S. Typhi-specific cytokine production, we found that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits significant IEL CD103+ CD4+ TRM mainly producing IL-2-S. In contrast, IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM exhibited significant increases in IFN\u03b3S, IL-17A-S and TNF\u03b1-S following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected targets in Ty21a-vaccinated than unvaccinated volunteers. These antigen-specific responses showed diverse characteristics in the epithelium, suggesting that migrating and/or locally differentiated CD103\u2212 CD4+TRM are likely Th1 and Th17 which might play a significant role in S. Typhi protective immunity. In contrast, CD103+ CD4+TRM producing IL-2 might be important in supporting T cells proliferation and likely supporting T regulatory cells in this compartment. Taken together, these data suggest that following oral Ty21a immunization, both CD4+TRM effector subsets are recruited from the LP and activated/differentiated uniquely in the epithelium, contributing distinct effector responses involved in effective S. Typhi immunity. This compartmentalization of TRM responses in the TI LPMC and IEL may provide important clues for the optimal design of future vaccines.",
