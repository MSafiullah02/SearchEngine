Thirty patients kept daily logs, noting URI symptoms in themselves, family members, and co-workers. Patients were examined every 3 months, or whenever an attack of MS occurred, and were tested for antibodies to common upper respiratory pathogens. A strong correlation was found between MS attacks and URIs. There were 168 URIs in 2,792 patient-weeks, including 3% weeks at risk (the interval beginning 1 week before and ending 5 weeks after onset of URI symptoms) and 1,796 weeks not at risk. Nearly two-thirds of attacks occurred in periods at risk. Attack rates were 2.92 per year in weeks at risk compared to 1.16 per year in weeks not at risk, a significant difference ( p < 0.001). Highdose interferon reduced the frequency of MS attacks, but had no effect on the number of URIs. Although a specific virus could not be incriminated, we concluded that URIs of presumed viral origin are an important trigger of MS attacks, and that treatment with IFN-f3 reduces the attack rate, but not by preventing URIs. Rather, it may modulate responses to viral infection that would otherwise lead to immune activation and clinical symptoms.",

(IFN-)I) in a small number of patients with relapsing-remitting MS, and in 1987 [3] published the disappointing but interesting result that administration of 1FN-y seemed to precipitate exacerbations of MS. This led to the hypothesis that infections might trigger attacks via release of cytokines such as IFN--y which then acted on the immune system to induce or enhance an autoreactive response to CNS antigens. Since then other investigators 141 have noted a connection with viral infections. No specific virus has been consistently implicated, although adenoviruses and herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been suggested. In addition, cytokines, especially IFN-y and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), seem to be produced in increased amounts just before acute attacks, or in conjunction with progression of MS 153.",

Nearly two-thirds of exacerbations occurred in periods at risk, and one-third of infections were accompanied or followed by exacerbations. Attack rates for the entire group, irrespective of treatment, were 2.92 per year in weeks at risk compared with 1.16 per year in weeks not at risk (see Fig 1) . The difference is significant at the 0.001 level. These figures are much hgher than those found in previous studies, probably because the data were collected prospectively and noted daily by the patients. Figure 2 shows the temporal relationship to exacerbations, with a peak at 1 week after the onset of clinical symptoms of infections. The exacerbations are divided into documented attacks and minor or nonreported attacks. The were considered to be genuine attacks, but either the patient was not examined at the time or the findings did not fulfill the criteria for documentation as a definite attack (i.e., they consisted of sensory symptoms alone or other symptoms without objective findings on neurological examination, which lasted a week or less and resolved completely with no treatment). When URIs and other infectious illnesses were compared between study subjects and family members or co-workers, there was no difference in seasonal incidence (see Fig 3) . The same spring and fall peaks were seen in both groups, phenomena also found by other investigators El}. There were also no significant differences between the incidence of or seasonal pattern of URls in the three treatment groups, indicating that systemic IFN treatment had no effect on the occurrence of infections. In conuast, we did not find a seasonal pattern for exacerbations of MS, suggesting that IFN treatment prevented at least some of the URIs from triggering attacks (see Fig 4) . Figure 5 shows the pattern of attacks in periods at risk and not at risk by treatment group. In this figure, only documented attacks are shown, with the highest attack rate in the placebo group and a lower rate in the 8 MIU group, irrespective of whether the patients were in the critical at risk periods surrounding U R I s . Finally, the number of attack-free patients was greatest in the 8 MIU group throughout the study (see Fig 6) .",
