In part, such outbreaks are the unavoidable consequence of global air travel, poverty, urban crowding, and incursions into ecologically remote regions. The inability to detect such outbreaks early in their course is the result of the absence of a coordinated international program for the detection and reporting of, and response to, potential epidemics. The failure of health authorities to publicize possible outbreaks often appears to reflect misguided efforts at governmental public relations rather than prevention of public panic.",

WHO estimates that the next flu pandemic might cause over 2 million hospitalizations and 650 000 deaths within 2 years in the developed world alone. As for many infections, the impact of influenza is greatest in immunocompromised populations -the elderly or malnourished, those with cardiopulmonary disease, and those with immune defects or receiving immune suppression.

Pigs become infected with human and avian influenza in addition to swine viruses. Outbreaks of influenza occur when multiple viruses from different species infect swine simultaneously, genetic reassortment (mixing) occurs, and a new virus with new virulence features and novel surface epitopes (antigenic shift) emerges. Novel strains emerge every few years -chicken flu, swine flu, Hong Kong flu, and this year's H7N7 avian flu in the Netherlands. Without vaccination, no immunity exists in people exposed to these new strains via contact with animals, and influenza spreads rapidly. Surveillance identifies the new strains and, prior to each outbreak, vaccines are developed for the predominant new strains. With an outbreak, animals thought to be reservoirs of disease are sacrificed and vaccine is available to combat the spread of infection. New mutant strains do not generally develop during an outbreak, and the vaccines generally remain effective on an annual basis.",

Special features of this outbreak are worth noting. Like influenza, coronaviruses infect many animal species. Coronaviruses mutate rapidly -changing surface epitopes. This has already occurred with the SARS coronavirus, and makes the development of effective vaccines extraordinarily difficult. Consider that no effective vaccines for the 'common cold' (largely rhinoviruses and coronaviruses) exist. Coronaviruses inhibit respiratory epithelial ciliary function -enhancing susceptibility to bacterial superinfection and pneumonia. SARS has spread rapidly as a nosocomial infection, affecting physicians, nurses and hospital staffs as well as community contacts of infected individuals. This reflects the stability of the virus in the environment, with spread by contamination of surfaces, hands and clothes.",

Transplant recipients are the sentinels for common pathogens in the environment -either in regions of high endemnicity (e.g. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, Trypanosoma cruzi in parts of South America) or during outbreaks of infection (e.g. West Nile Virus or SARS coronavirus). This becomes a barrier to the performance of transplant procedures when infection may be transmitted by blood transfusions or with transplanted tissues. In the absence of sensitive, rapid and accurate microbiologic assays for screening of cadaveric donors in a timely fashion, transplantation may cease for the duration of the epidemic. This is a reasonable, if unfortunate, precaution. With clinical disease overwhelming medical facilities and filling ICU beds, even elective surgery is reduced, eliminating living organ donation also.

It is essential that widely available, rapid, accurate, highly sensitive and low-cost assays be available for screening of possibly infected individuals and for epidemiologic surveys. Assays for the SARS-associated coronavirus are now available. In an epidemic, the early availability of such diagnostic tools provides a critical advantage.

One possible approach is to develop worldwide screening and reporting systems for novel infections, both in patients and in animals. One focus of such surveillance is the sentinel population of immunosuppressed patients after organ or stem-cell transplantation or after cancer chemotherapy. Such patients provide a fertile ground for most types of pathogens. We do little, however, to take advantage of these highly susceptible populations to track 'unusual infectious events' that may indicate the start of the next epidemic. Cooperative systems that exist are hindered by the absence of resources, incompatibility of data sets or computer systems, or lack of political will to assure compliance. For xenotransplantation, some governments concerned about the potential introduction of unknown or unrecognized infections from other species into immunocompromised humans require specimen archiving, incident reporting and tracking of contacts. For bioterrorism, such tracking is, for all we know, cloaked in the intelligence community until outbreaks occur -and deaths result. Meaningful distinctions do not exist for the medical community between epidemics caused by natural causes, new technologies or bioterrorism. One international surveillance system would serve us all. Such surveillance could utilize newer molecular techniques (e.g. broad-range polymerase chain reaction primers, oligonucleotide microarrays, or representational difference analysis) to recognize novel molecular species (potential pathogens).",
