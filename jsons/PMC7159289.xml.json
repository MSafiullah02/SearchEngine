Some counties within the country, however, remain relatively poor and continue to have a set of health challenges dominated by communicable, maternal, and neonatal causes.3, 4 China needs to understand and formulate a long-range strategy to tackle several challenges in public health and medical care at the same time.",

YLLs are computed by multiplying the number of deaths in each age group by a reference life expectancy at that age. The life expectancy at birth in the reference life table is 86\u00b70 years based on the lowest reported death rates for each age group across countries in 2010, and is intended to represent an achievable pattern of mortality.26 Years lived with disability are calculated from the prevalence of a sequela multiplied by the disability weight for that sequela. Disability weights are based on surveys of the general population.27 DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The GBD uses another indicator, healthy life expectancy (HALE), to summarise overall population health in one number, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health at different ages.28\n",

We assessed the quality of each data source, and mapped the codes for various Chinese variants of the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) tabulation lists to the GBD 2010 cause list. We reassigned deaths assigned to ill-defined diagnoses or to disorders that are not likely to be underlying causes of death with standard algorithms.30, 31 GBD 2010 provides the most comprehensive effort to date to enhance the comparability of cause of death data across countries because it adjusts for revisions of the ICD and the redistribution of garbage codes. Garbage codes are causes of death that should not be identified as underlying causes of death but have been entered as the underlying cause of death on death certificates. Classic examples of garbage codes include senility or cardiopulmonary arrest. Uncertainty in cause of death estimates has been captured with standard simulation methods by taking 1000 draws32 for each age, sex, country, year, and cause.24 Final uncertainty for death numbers and YLLs also reflects uncertainty in the levels of all-cause mortality in each age-sex-country-year.",

Second, each risk factor exposure distribution in each country, age, and sex group was estimated on the basis of published and unpublished data sources with mostly Bayesian estimation methods.23 For China, key sources included the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey, the China Global Youth Tobacco Survey, the Second National Health Services Survey, the 1996 Global Youth Tobacco Survey, the 1996 National Prevalence Survey, the After-MONICA, the INTERSALT Beijing, the INTERMAP Beijing, and the 2000 and 2005 national censuses.

We compared China outcomes to the 18 other countries that are members of the G20 (the 20th member is the European Union). The G20 is the set of developed and developing countries identified as global agenda setters. Comparisons of China with this group provide insights into China's standing relative to this set of developed or rapidly developing countries. For each quantity of interest in the GBD, 1000 draws were taken from the posterior distribution. We computed ranks across causes and percentage change from 1990 to 2010 at the draw level. We report 95% uncertainty intervals for ranks. For percentage change from 1990 to 2010 computed at the level of each draw, we report the median percentage change, which is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean percentage change. For a specific country and cause, we tested whether a country was significantly greater than the G20 mean, indistinguishable from the mean, or below the mean.",

The composite diet risk factor is made up of 14 different components (appendix p 8). Analysed component by component, the most important factors in the dietary composite factor were diets that were low in fruits, high in sodium, or low in whole grains; all of which are problems with diet even in rural areas. The second leading risk factor was high blood pressure, which accounted for 12\u00b70% (10\u00b74\u201313\u00b75) of DALYs and 24\u00b76% (21\u00b79\u201327\u00b72) of deaths.

The burden of disease is now dominated by cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, road injuries, and key causes of chronic disabilities such as mental and musculoskeletal disorders. Although the burden of suicide, drowning, and many injuries declined, the burden of road injuries and falls is increasing. The rise of non-communicable diseases and chronic disability is fuelled by a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children toward those for non-communicable diseases in adults. The one child policy in China implies the demographic shifts contributing to this rapid transition in health problems will intensify in the coming decades.",

Deaths from diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years declined by 90% in the two decades from 1990. DALYs caused by tuberculosis dropped by about 71%. We also noted large declines for incidence of infection with intestinal nematodes, meningitis, tetanus, measles, and diarrhoea. The speed of some of these declines provides a model for other developing countries. Communicable disease-control challenges, however, are not over. The burden of HIV increased between 1990 and 2010 (table 2). 213 000 (95% UI 179 600\u2013260 700) children younger than 5 years died in 2010, almost 60% of them from communicable, neonatal, and nutritional causes. Subnational assessments would probably reveal that the burden of communicable diseases is high in some poor provinces. China faces challenges dealing with the ongoing risk of pandemic influenza. The 2013 outbreak of H7N9 shows how the interaction between animal and human populations continues to lead to new epidemics. Through the internet-based surveillance system run by the Chinese CDC, early detection of the first human cases of H7N9 led to a coherent response. Despite progress, continued attention to the unfinished agenda for communicable disease control is required and ongoing epidemic surveillance and response is a necessity.",

The most important behaviours included diets low in fruit, high in sodium and low in whole grains, smoking, alcohol, and physical inactivity. Smoking prevalence in China for men is 52\u00b79% (one of the highest rates in the world) and for women is 2\u00b74% (one of the lowest),55 and second-hand smoke exposure is as high as 72\u00b74%.23, 56 The fraction of deaths attributable to tobacco increased from 12\u00b78% (9\u00b79\u201316\u00b79) in 1990 to 16\u00b74% (12\u00b78\u201319\u00b79) in 2010 (appendix p 10) and will increase because of the lag between consumption and death rates. The aggregation of 14 components of diet was the leading risk factor for DALYs in China, including the consumption of sodium and inadequate intake of fruit, whole grains, and nuts and seeds. Reliable data from the national nutrition surveys show that even rural Chinese diets dominated by rice are low in fruit, high in sodium, low in whole grains, and low in nuts and seeds. Rising incomes and a larger fraction of the population living to older ages mean that the burden attributable to these behaviours will increase. The extraordinary pace of urbanisation in China might exacerbate this transformation. The urban population in China has more than tripled in the past 30 years and the rate of urbanisation is accelerating.57, 58 Although urbanisation offers opportunities for improvements in population health in China (such as access to improved health care and basic infrastructure), it also can lead to substantial health risks including ambient air pollution, occupational and traffic hazards, and poor diet and little physical activity. Associated social and economic challenges will accompany these shifts. For example, the ratio of the population older than 65 years to the working-aged population (aged 20\u201364 years) was 0\u00b7127 in 2010 and is expected to rise to 0\u00b7184 in 2020 and 0\u00b726 in 2030.2\n",

Incidence of health loss and health-care costs from mental disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and vision and hearing loss will steadily rise. China needs to plan for how the health system can prevent and manage these disorders cost-effectively. Along with Japan, South Korea, and Mexico, China seems to benefit from lower rates of major depression, anxiety disorders, and low back pain than do other members of the G20. This finding, however, has been challenged; true rates might be higher.36 Our findings on these rates are based on the careful assessment of all the available evidence; resolution will require more in-depth research on the potential for reporting biases in China and other countries in east Asia. The rise of chronic disability also has implications for the types of health workers China will need in the next 10\u201320 years; disciplines such as psychiatry, rheumatology, rehabilitation medicine, audiology, and ophthalmology might need increased investment. The recent adoption of China's first mental health law is a positive development in this area. The key obstacle China confronts in strengthening its public health and primary health care is a shortage of human resources. Although the Chinese Government has identified the training of family doctors as a top priority60 (and plans to train 300 000 of them in the next 10 years), these targets seem challenging to reach. Retention of qualified health professionals in rural areas, especially in poor regions, has been difficult.",

What are the policy options for China to address this unusually high burden of selected cancers? Tobacco and diet can account for important shares of stomach, colorectal, and lung cancers. Aggressive tobacco control and national efforts to encourage changes in diet will be important. Hepatitis B is related to 54\u00b72% (95% UI 49\u00b75\u201358\u00b78) of the increasing burden of liver cancer; immunisation programmes will lead eventually to reductions but, because the median age of liver cancer burden is 55 years, several decades will need to pass before the effect of vaccination can substantially reduce the burden of this cancer.

Public health programmes to reduce tobacco consumption, sodium intake, and change other dietary risks are clearly important strategies for tackling of cardiovascular diseases in China. Primary care can also be a platform for delivery of interventions such as the detection and pharmacological management of raised blood pressure and cholesterol, and screening and management of diabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance. Because of China's hospital-centred health system, strengthening primary care to handle these and other problems will require a shift in policy focus. The massive declines in rates of death from ischaemic heart disease in many high-income countries have also been attributable to improved management of acute cardiac events and post-event care.62, 63, 64, 65, 66 China increasingly needs to provide access to high-quality medical services in communities with rising rates of cardiovascular diseases.",

Results have been informed by several data sources available for China but for some disorders the data are weak or absent (eg, autism, cannabis dependence, endometriosis, and genital prolapse). In other cases, substantial differences exist between the available data sources (eg, for some cancers the cause of death data and population-based cancer registry data are inconsistent in some age groups). The reporting of UIs provides the reader with some information on the extent of the information available for China. Uncertainty could, for various reasons such as unrecognised bias in published studies, still be underestimated. The analysis of risk factors has focused on proximal and behavioural risks. The important role of social determinants67 was not quantified in the GBD 2010 because of a dearth of available data and sufficient evidence. The assessment of YLDs depends crucially on the validity of the disability weights measured by Salomon and colleagues.27 Although investigation across several countries reported no evidence of systematic differences; disability weights obtained in a national survey in China could be different from other countries.68, 69 Most importantly, a national analysis for a country as large and diverse as China could mask substantial variations in key outcomes. For example, the HIV epidemic is very concentrated in some provinces.70, 71 The rapid transition towards non-communicable diseases and disability is probably more advanced in eastern provinces. In view of improvements in some data systems in the previous decade, the possibility of bias exists in the measurement of some diseases overtime. We believe that the substantial efforts to correct for these biases that are part of the GBD method minimises this possibility.",

Annual assessments along with subnational detail at the provincial level ought to be undertaken. Key developments in the health information system that are underway will facilitate such an analysis. Development of a complete national vital events registration system with certification of cause of death would strikingly aid in this endeavour. In the previous 2 years alone, a rapid expansion has occurred in coverage of cause of death certification so that more than half of all deaths were captured in 2012. The national internet case reporting system can provide local level detail on 39 diseases since 2004. Several national surveys are underway or planned with large sample sizes. Ensuring that the various surveillance systems and topic-specific national surveys ultimately combine to provide a coherent picture of the prevalence of major diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the provincial level will also reduce the role of statistical estimation in generating burden of disease results. Robust annual assessments of the burden will provide China with a powerful method to benchmark progress against developed and other rapidly developing nations and assess where investments and policy action have been effective. Setting priorities for the health system, however, will also need information on the costs and consequences of different policy options, a better understanding of health inequalities and the capacity of the health system to implement change that is both efficient and fair.",
