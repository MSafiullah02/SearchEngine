The American Society of Regional Anesthesia accepts the use of alcoholic chlorhexidine solution prior to neuraxial blockade despite case reports and experimental evidence that clinically used concentrations are toxic when applied directly to neural tissue [ 1 , 2 ] . A recent large retrospective study of its use prior to spinal anesthesia seems to confi rm safety when used in this setting [ 3 ] . [ 4 -8 ] The extent of disinfection required prior to the use of medical equipment varies depending on the site of application: (1) sterilization if contacting deep tissues, (2) high-level disinfection (HLD; destruction of vegetative microbes but not spores) if contacting intact mucosa, and (3) low-level disinfection (LLD; destruction of most vegetative bacteria, some fungi, and some viruses in <10 min) if contacting intact skin. Standard and videolaryngoscopes and bronchoscopes are reusable anesthesia equipment most often requiring sterilization/disinfection. Anesthesia providers should also know how to perform LLD of the surfaces of an anesthesia workstation and how to decontaminate an environmental spill of blood or a disinfectant solution used in their facility. Because of the consequences of process failure (inoculation of a patient with a pathogenic organism), all HLD and sterilization processes require monitoring (usually both chemical and biological) to verify satisfactory completion.",
