Not until 1933, when the first human influenza virus was isolated, was it possible to define with certainty which pandemics were caused by influenza viruses. In general, influenza A viruses are more pathogenic than are influenza B viruses. Influenza A virus is a zoonotic infection, and more than 100 types of influenza A viruses infect most species of birds, pigs, horses, dogs, and seals. It is believed that the 1918-1919 pandemic originated from a virulent strain of H1N1 from pigs and birds.",

The binding preference of a given HA for one or other of these linkage types correlates with the species specificity for infection (species barrier).

Human viruses of the H1, H2, and H3 subtypes that are known to have caused pandemics in 1918, 1957, and 1968, respectively, recognize \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid, the major form found on cells of the human respiratory tract (9) .",

There have been several examples where simple changes in a single gene resulted in dramatic changes in virulence.

Although this change has been found in the H5 and H7 subtypes in birds, it was not found in the 1918 HA (5) . In another change observed in the NA gene, the loss of a glycosylation site at amino acid 146 in WSN/33 contributed to making the virus exceptionally virulent as well as neurotropic in mice. This change was also not observed in the 1918 virus strain (3).",

The base sequence homology between the individual genes (segments) of the H2N2 virus and those of different influenza A strains has been determined by molecular hybridization. Segments 1, 5, 7, and 8 of the Singapore strain exhibit a base sequence homology of almost 100% compared with those of the FM1 strain (HlNl), whereas the homology between the other segments was significantly lower (24% to 76%). For the Singapore and Hong Kong (H3N2) strains, all segments except that coding for the HA (24%) exhibit a homology close to 100%. The 32 P-labeled segment 4 (HA gene) of the avian influenza A strain duck Ukraine (Hav7Neg2) showed a homology of 92% to Hong Kong, whereas the homology of at least two other segments was significantly lower. These results were interpreted as an indication that the H2N2 subtype is derived from the HlN1 subtype by a recombination event retaining four H1N1 segments, whereas the other four segments were gained from another yet unknown strain. The H3N2 subtype is presumably derived from a H2N2 subtype, retaining seven segments of the H2N2 subtype, whereas the gene coding for the HA is obtained from the duck Ukraine or another highly related strain (13).",

The current egg-based system used to produce licensed influenza vaccines-despite being reliable for more than 40 yearscan still be improved. Limitations of the current system include (i) a lengthy manufacturing process; (ii) the need to select which virus strains will be in the vaccine at least 6 months in advance of the influenza season; (iii) the need to produce nearly 90 million doses of a new influenza vaccine each year; and (iv) the need for hundreds of millions of fertilized chicken eggs to manufacture the vaccine. The early decision about which strains to include in the influenza vaccine will not always be correct, and the long lead time required to produce the vaccine makes midstream corrective action impossible. Additional limitations may also include allergenicity of eggs in some individuals, and the inability to use eggs for propagating viruses lethal to chickens. NIAID is currently supporting several research projects aimed at developing vaccines that can be manufactured more rapidly, are more broadly cross-protective, and are more effective. The use of reverse genetics-a genetic tool developed by NIAID-supported scientists-holds the promise of more rapid generation of high-yielding vaccine candidates that match the anticipated epidemic strain. Reverse genetics can also be used to turn highly pathogenic influenza viruses into vaccine candidates more suitable for manufacturing of vaccine by removing or modifying certain virulence genes; laboratories around the world are using the technique to prepare vaccine candidates against the H5N1 viruses emerging in Asia. NIAID also is funding the development of new influenza vaccine technologies. Recently, NIAID supported a Phase II clinical trial of a new influenza vaccine produced in a cell culture system as an alternative to manufacturing the vaccine in eggs. Another approach has focused on improving the effectiveness of current inactivated virus vaccines by giving increasing doses of influenza vaccine to elderly individuals, the population that frequently accounts for up to 90% of influenza deaths each year in the United States. NIAID is also funding the development of new technologies for the production of influenza vaccines; these involve DNAbased approaches and broadly protective vaccines based on influenza virus proteins that are shared by multiple strains of the influenza virus. (i) NIAID's continuing support for the development of novel vaccination strategies for the elderly. Thus, a study conducted to assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a current U.S. vaccine formulation at increased doses in the elderly population (65 years and older; n=202) has shown that at the increased dose (60 \u03bcg), higher levels were observed for the mean serum hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody levels (44% to 71% and 54% to 79%, respectively) compared with the standard dose (15 \u03bcg) of the vaccine (33) . Increasing the antigen content of inactivated vaccines may provide a straightforward approach to improving protection in the elderly. undertaken an initiative to develop a protective vaccine that is effective against multiple influenza strains (see Section 13.8). The proposed approach is to incorporate both conserved and variable genes into DNA and adenoviral (AdV) vectors that can be readily produced by existing methodologies. In particular, the VRC has been involved in developing three new vaccines, each comprising a single plasmid DNA encoding hemagglutinin protein from H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtypes isolated from recent human outbreaks of influenza. Adenoviral construct expressing the same inserts are also being constructed. In addition, protein subunit vaccines based on production from insect and mammalian cells are being developed and tested. r Immunity to Influenza.

The activities undertaken by the NIAID Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance will lay the groundwork for developing new and improved control measures for emerging and re-emerging influenza viruses, including determining the prevalence of avian influenza viruses in animals in close contact with humans, understanding how influenza viruses evolve, adapt, and transmit, and identifying immunologic factors that determine disease outcome. In the event of an urgent public health emergency involving the emergence and rapid spread of an influenza pandemic in humans, the network of centers will also develop and implement a NIAID Pandemic Public Health Research Response Plan.",

Whereas the presence of neutralizing antibodies specific for the HA glycoprotein at systemic or mucosal sites of infection would provide immediate protection against infection with influenza viruses, the clearance of human influenza viruses depends mainly on cellmediated immunity (43) . Although antibodies specific for the NA glycoprotein do not neutralize infectivity, they restrict virus replication by preventing the release of new virus particles, a process that requires viral NA proteins. Therefore, antibodies specific for NA can decrease the severity of the disease (44, 45) . Epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are present on NP, PB2, and PA proteins of human influenza viruses. Therefore, if a virus with a new HA and/or NA glycoprotein emerges in the human population, cell-mediated immunity directed against the highly conserved internal proteins could have a role in protection at the time of a pandemic (14) . The principle underlying the currently licensed vaccines against human influenza viruses is the induction of protective antibodies specific for the HA glycoprotein of the predicted epidemic strain. The concentration of HA glycoprotein in licensed, inactivated virus vaccines for seasonal influenza is standardized, but the concentration of NA glycoprotein is not standardized (14) .",

Consequently, for vaccines that are based on the currently licensed technologies, the availability of embryonated eggs is a crucial factor, and if the pandemic virus causes widespread morbidity and mortality in poultry, the supply of embryonated eggs might be compromised. Therefore, alternative substrates, including mammalian cell lines, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and Vero cells, have been developed for the production of influenza viruses for use in vaccines. To this end, considerable progress was made in the development of vaccines based on inactivated influenza viruses and live cold-adapted influenza viruses grown in these cell lines in microcarrier fermentors (56) (57) (58) .",

Unlike mice, ferrets develop fever, rhinorrhea, and sneezing after infection with intranasally administered human influenza viruses and the virus replicates in the respiratory tract of these animals.

The subvirion vaccines were safe and well-tolerated in healthy adults, and the antibody response that was induced could be enhanced by increasing the dose of antigen used or by the addition of an adjuvant (72, 79) . A whole-virus vaccine was also well-tolerated by humans, and when administered with an adjuvant, this vaccine was immunogenic at a lower dose than that of the subvirion vaccines (74) . However, the available data indicate that inactivated H5 influenza virus vaccines are poorly immunogenic and require a large concentration of HA glycoprotein or co-administration with an adjuvant to achieve the desired antibody response (14) .",

Hence, virus shedding during clinical testing of these vaccines must be closely monitored (14) . There are potential challenges in the development of live attenuated virus vaccines for pandemic influenza, namely, (i) to generate reassortant viruses that are sufficiently infectious when the HA glycoprotein is derived from an avian influenza virus, in particular if the HA used has a preference for \u03b12,3-linked oligosaccharides; (ii) to reproducibly achieve the desired level of viral attenuation with different combinations of HA and NA genes; and (iii) to minimize the risk of reassortment with circulating human influenza viruses. The evaluation of live attenuated virus vaccines of different subtypes in preclinical studies in appropriate animal models and in clinical studies will address the first two challenges. The standard approach of preclinical evaluation that is applied to vaccines against human influenza viruses might not be uniformly applicable to avian influenza viruses, because the infectivity, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of avian influenza viruses of different subtypes have not been studied extensively (86) . The risk of reassortment of the live attenuated vaccine virus with human influenza viruses during clinical trials can be minimized by conducting vaccine studies in isolation units when human influenza viruses are not circulating in the community. In the event of an influenza pandemic, the potential benefits of a live attenuated virus vaccine will have to be balanced against the risks associated with it, and this type of vaccine will only be introduced judiciously when a pandemic is imminent (14) .",

A recombinant baculovirus-expressed H5 glycoprotein subunit vaccine was well tolerated but was poorly immunogenic in humans, indicating the need for an adjuvant (97) .

In addition, when the immunogenicity of candidate pandemic vaccines is assessed, the data can be difficult to interpret because specific information on the nature and magnitude of the antibody response that correlates with protection is lacking. If a vaccine is immunogenic, it might be possible to assess its efficacy by testing the vaccine in a large group of people who are at high risk from infection with avian influenza virus, such as poultry farmers in areas with severe epizootics (14) . Serum and mucosal antibodies can independently mediate immunity to influenza viruses. Live viruses and inactivated virus vaccines differ in the induction of protective antibodies, but there are no standardized methods for evaluating the mucosal antibody response. The conventional assay for assessing the immunogenicity of a human influenza vaccine is the hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Although the standard hemagglutination-inhibition assay, which uses chicken or turkey erythrocytes, is relatively insensitive for the detection of antibodies specific for H5N1 viruses, there is a modified assay using horse erythrocytes that was found to be more sensitive because horse erythrocytes exclusively express the \u03b12,3-linked oligosaccharide side chains that are preferred for binding by avian influenza viruses. However, the horse erythrocyte hemagglutination-inhibition assay has not been well standardized, and the antibody titers determined by this assay that correlate with protection are not known. Therefore, the choice of assays by which the immune response is assessed poses a practical challenge for the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines (14) .",

However, it is not known whether this antibody titer correlates with protection from re-infection. Other barriers to the use of the neutralization assay are the requirement for appropriate biosafety containment measures, as the assay requires handling of the infectious virus, and the fact that the test has not yet been standardized (107).",

A team of NIAID-supported scientists has released genomic data from the first large-scale sequencing of AIV isolates, doubling the amount of AIV sequence data in the public domain (109) . These sequence data include 2,196 AIV genes and 169 complete genomes from a diverse sample of birds. The preliminary analysis of these sequences, along with other AIV data from the public domain, revealed new information about AIV, including the identification of a genome sequence that may be a determinant of virulence.

Furthermore, the individual RNPs are suspended from the interior of the viral envelope at the distal end of the budding virion and are oriented perpendicular to the budding tip. These findings have argued against a random incorporation of RNPs into virions, supporting instead a model in which each segment contains specific incorporation signals that would enable the RNPs to be recruited and packaged as a complete set. The selective mechanism of RNP incorporation into virions and the unique organization of the eight RNP segments may be crucial to maintaining the integrity of the viral genome during repeated cycles of replication (110) .",

The hemagglutinin structure at 2.9\u00c5 resolution from a highly pathogenic Vietnamese H5N1 influenza virus (Viet04) has been elucidated (111) . Its structure was found to be more related to that of the 1918 (8) and other human H1 hemagglutinins than to a 1997 duck H5 hemagglutinin. Glycan microarray analysis of the Viet04 virus revealed an avian \u03b12,3 sialic acid receptor binding preference. Introduction of mutations that can convert H1 serotype hemagglutinins to human \u03b12,6 receptor specificity only enhanced or reduced affinity for the avian-type receptors. However, mutations that can convert avian H2 and H3 hemagglutinins to human receptor specificity, when inserted onto the Viet04 hemagglutinin framework, permitted binding to a natural \u03b12,6 glycan, thereby suggesting a path for this H5N1 virus to gain a foothold in the human population (111) . r NS1-Truncated Modified Live-Virus Vaccine. Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) naturally infect pigs and can be transmitted to humans. Furthermore, in the pig, genetic reassortment to create novel influenza subtypes by mixing avian and human influenza viruses is possible. Therefore, a vaccine against SIV and inducing cross-protective immunity between different subtypes and strains circulating in pigs will be highly advantageous. To this end, an H3N2 SIV (A/swine/Texas/4199-2/98) (labeled TX98) containing a deleted NS1 gene expressing a truncated NS1 protein of 126 amino acids (NS1/126) was attenuated in swine. Subsequently, 4-week-old pigs were vaccinated with the TX98 NS1/126 modified live-virus (MLV) vaccine. The highly attenuated MVL completely protected against challenge with the homologous SIV (112) . Vaccinated pigs challenged with the heterosubtypic N1N1 virus demonstrated macroscopic lung lesions similar to those of the unvaccinated H1N1 control pigs. Remarkably, vaccinated pigs challenged with the H1N1 SIV had significantly less microscopic lung lesions and less virus shedding from the respiratory tract than did unvaccinated, H1N1-challenged pigs. Furthermore, all vaccinated pigs developed significant levels of hemagglutination inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers in serum and mucosal immunoglobulin A antibodies against H3N2 SIV antigens (112).",
