This can expand the spatial extent to which the emitted infectious particles can travel. Health care workers and employers who are not directly involved in patient care are also at risk of virus transmission due to this and need to take adequate precautions.",

There is a high chance that newly recruited or mobilised health care staff lack thorough knowledge of PPE usage. After gowning up, healthcare workers may get a sense of protection. This could be disastrous, as there is always a possibility that the health care staff may become a victim of human error making them vulnerable. This is a common scenario during the removal and disposing of PPE safely. Once the purpose is served, the users must take the utmost caution while disrobing and disposing of the PPE. Those at the forefront are busy and stressed with long shifts in sub-optimal conditions and fatigue is bound to set in. The staff may overlook the strict protocol of removal and disposal of PPE, thus defeating the entire purpose of wearing PPE.",
