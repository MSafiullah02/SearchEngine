Prioritising and rationing of resources; implementation of restrictions; and protocol development are constantly under review. The wearing of a face mask should be considered not only for protection of RTTs, but primarily for patient safety. \uf0b7 RTTs should be provided with personal protection equipment (PPE) as per national or WHO recommendations for treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 status. For treatments and procedures where there is a higher chance of droplet transmission, eye goggles and face shields should be considered. Examples of PPE recommendations are given in table 1. Strict hand hygiene must be followed before and after removing the PPE. \uf0b7 Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 status should be treated on a separate treatment machine with its own entrance if possible. Alternatively, these patients can be treated at the end of the day to minimise any unnecessary contact between these patients and other COVID-19 negative patients.",

To provide an efficient and reliable telecommunication system between the RT department and remote access stations, RT departments need to optimise the ways of how to store relevant data electronically and safely. Caution should be taken during the exchange of confidential patient data. \uf0b7 Where clinic review and follow up appointments are RTT-led, these should be conducted through telephone consultations/virtual meetings, in consensus with the radiation oncologists. \uf0b7 An internal communications plan should be established to ensure continuous communication from the senior administration to clinical RTTs.

In case of using spirometry-based breathhold RT equipment, infection prevention and control teams should be consulted to check if the hygiene rules of treating patients with the equipment should be adapted. Specialist cleaning of all RT equipment and treatment rooms is required after RT delivery to patients with a COVID-19 suspected or confirmed status. \uf0b7 Where additional personnel for online image guided RT (IGRT) decisions are required e.g. complex cases, gross anatomy changes, tumour displacement, these should be viewed and approved at a remote station. \uf0b7 Recognised offline IGRT correction protocols should be used if daily online imaging is not possible, whilst ensuring that adequate coverage for uncertainty is maintained.",
