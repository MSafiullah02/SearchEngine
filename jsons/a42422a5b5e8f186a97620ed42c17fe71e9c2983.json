            "text": "Molecular clock models are commonly used to estimate evolutionary rates and timescales from nucleotide sequences. The goal of these models is to account for rate variation among lineages, such that they are assumed to be adequate descriptions of the processes that generated the data. A common approach for selecting a clock model for a data set of interest is to examine a set of candidates and to select the model that provides the best statistical fit. However, this can lead to unreliable estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate. For this reason, a method of evaluating absolute model performance is critical. We describe a method that uses posterior predictive simulations to assess the adequacy of clock models. We test the power of this approach using simulated data and find that the method is sensitive to bias in the estimates of branch lengths, which tends to occur when using underparameterized clock models. We also compare the performance of the multinomial test statistic, originally developed to assess the adequacy of substitution models, but find that it has low power in identifying the adequacy of clock models. We illustrate the performance of our method using empirical data sets from coronaviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, killer whales, and marine turtles.",

The problem of inferring phylogenies and evolutionary divergence times is a statistical one, such that inferences are dependent on reliable models of the evolutionary process (Felsenstein 1983) . Bayesian methods provide a powerful framework for estimating phylogenetic trees and evolutionary rates and timescales using parameter-rich models (Huelsenbeck et al. 2001; Yang and Rannala 2012) . Model-based phylogenetic inference in a Bayesian framework has several desirable properties: It is possible to include detailed descriptions of molecular evolution (Dutheil et al. 2012; Heath et al. 2012) ; many of the model assumptions are explicit (Sullivan and Joyce 2005) ; large parameter spaces can be explored efficiently (Nylander et al. 2004; Drummond et al. 2006) ; and uncertainty is naturally incorporated in the estimates. As a consequence, the number and complexity of evolutionary models for Bayesian inference has grown rapidly, prompting considerable interest in methods of model selection (Xie et al. 2011; Baele et al. 2013) .",

Traditional methods of model selection do not allow the rejection, or falsification, of every model in the set of candidates being considered.

One method of evaluating the adequacy of a model is to use posterior predictive checks (Gelman et al. 2014) . Among the first of such methods in phylogenetics was the use of posterior predictive simulations, proposed by Bollback (2002) . The first step in this approach is to conduct a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the empirical data. The second step is to use simulation to generate data sets with the same size as the empirical data, using the values of model parameters sampled from the posterior distribution obtained in the first step. The data generated via these posterior predictive simulations are considered to represent hypothetical alternative or future data sets, but generated by the model used for inference.",

Molecular clock models describe the pattern of evolutionary rates among lineages, relying on external temporal information (e.g., fossil data) to calibrate estimates of absolute rates and times. The primary differences among the various clock models include the number of distinct substitution rates across the tree and the degree to which rates are treated as a heritable trait (Thorne et al. 1998; Drummond et al. 2006; Drummond and Suchard 2010 ; for a review see Ho and Duch\u00eane 2014) . For example, the strict clock assumes that the rate is the same for all branches, whereas some relaxed clock models allow each branch to have a different rate. We refer to models that assume a large number of rates as being more parameter rich than models with a small number of rates . Although molecular clock models are used routinely, the methods of assessing their efficacy are restricted to estimating and comparing their statistical fit. For example, a common means of model selection is to compare marginal likelihoods in a Bayesian framework (Baele et al. 2013 ). However, model selection can only evaluate the relative statistical fit of the models, such that it can lead to false confidence in the estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate.",

For each of these samples, we multiply the branch-specific rates and times to produce phylogenetic trees in which the branch lengths are measured in substitutions per site (subs/ site), known as phylograms. To assess model adequacy, we randomly select 100 samples from the posterior, excluding the burn-in. From these samples, posterior predictive data sets are generated by simulation along the phylograms and using the estimates of the parameters in the nucleotide substitution model. The third step in our approach is to use a clock-free method to estimate a phylogram from each of the posterior predictive data sets and from the empirical data set.

To do this, we compared the values used to generate the data with those estimated using each of three clock models: Strict clock, random local clocks (Drummond and Suchard 2010) , and the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (Drummond et al. 2006) . We regarded the branch-specific rates as accurate when the rate used for the simulation was contained within the 95% credible interval. We found that rate estimates were frequently inaccurate under five circumstances: Clock model underparameterization; rate autocorrelation among branches (Kishino et al. 2001) ; uncorrelated beta-distributed rate variation among lineages; misleading node-age priors (i.e., node calibrations that differ considerably from the true node ages); and when data were generated under a strict clock but analyzed with an underparameterized substitution model ( fig. 2a ). When analyses were performed using the correct or an overparameterized clock model, more than 75% of branch rates were accurately estimated, such that the true value was contained within the 95% credible interval ( fig. 2a) . In most simulation schemes, the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock had high accuracy, at the expense of a small increase in the uncertainty compared with the other models ( fig. 2b ). These results are broadly similar to those of Drummond et al. (2006) , who also found that underparameterization of the clock model resulted in low accuracy in rate estimates, whereas overparameterization had a negligible effect on accuracy.",

The substitution model was identified as inadequate for the coronavirus data set by the multinomial test statistic estimated using posterior predictive data sets from a clock analysis (P < 0.05); however, it was identified as adequate when using a clock-free method (P = 0.20). The mitochondrial data set from killer whales represented the only case in which the substitution model was adequate according to both multinomial likelihood estimates.

These indices are substantially lower than those obtained in analyses of simulated data when the clock model used for simulation and estimation was matched.

Low values for this metric indicate small differences between the posterior predictive and the empirical branch lengths. Although scores for this metric varied considerably between data sets, they were closely associated with the A indices for the different models for each data set individually. For example, in every empirical data set, the lowest branch length deviation was achieved by the model with the highest A index (indicative of higher performance). Importantly, the branch length deviation was not directly comparable with the A index between data sets. MBE This is probably because the posterior predictive branch lengths have different amounts of uncertainty. In particular, the A index will tend to be low if the posterior predictive branch length estimates are similar to the empirical value but have low uncertainty. This would create a scenario with a small branch length deviation but also a low A index. This appears to be the case for the coronaviruses, for which all the clock models appear inadequate according to the A index, but with the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock having a small branch length deviation.",

            "text": "Assessing the adequacy of models in phylogenetics is an important process that can provide information beyond that offered by traditional methods for model selection. Although traditional model selection can be used to evaluate the relative statistical fit of a set of candidates, model adequacy provides information about the absolute performance of the model, such that even the best-fitting model can be a poor predictor of the data (Gelman et al. 2014 ). There have been important developments in model adequacy methods and test statistics in the context of substitution models (Ripplinger and Sullivan 2010; Brown 2014b; Lewis et al. 2014 ) and estimates of gene trees (Reid et al. 2014 ). Here we have described a method that can be used for assessment of molecular clock models, and which should be used in combination with approaches for evaluating the adequacy of substitution models. The results of our analyses suggest that our method is able detect whether estimates of branchspecific rates and times are consistent with the expected number of substitutions along each branch. For example, in the coronavirus data set analyzed here, the best-fitting clock model was a poor predictor of the data, as was the substitution model. Our index is sensitive to underparameterization of clock models and has the benefit of being computationally efficient. In addition, our metric of uncertainty in posterior predictive branch lengths is sensitive to some cases of misspecification of clock models and node-age priors, but not to substitution model misspecification, as shown for our analyses of the coronavirus data set. Analyses based on the random local clock and the data simulated under two local clocks generally produced low accuracy ( fig. 2a) , with lower A indices than the other models that were matched to the true model ( fig. 3a) . The substandard performance of the random local clock when it is matched to the true model is surprising. A possible explanation is that our simulations of the local clock represented an extreme scenario in which the rates of the local clocks differed by an order of magnitude. Previous studies based on simulations and empirical data demonstrated that this model can be effective when the rate differences are smaller (Drummond and Suchard 2010; Dornburg et al. 2012) .",

This is consistent with the results of previous studies of posterior predictive simulations, which have suggested that the proposed threshold for a test statistic using simulations is conservative for empirical data (Bollback 2002; Ripplinger and Sullivan 2010; Brown 2014b) . It is difficult to suggest a specific threshold for our index to determine whether a model is inadequate. However, the interpretation is straightforward: A low A index indicates that a large proportion of branch rates and times are inconsistent with the expected number of substitutions along the branches. Under ideal conditions, an A index of 0.95 or higher means that the clock model accurately describes the true pattern of rate variation. However, our method allows the user to inspect the particular branches with inconsistent estimates, which can be useful for identifying regions of the tree that cause the clock model to be inadequate. Measuring the effect size of differences in the branch length estimates of the posterior predictive and empirical data can also be useful for quantifying potential errors in the estimates of node times and branch-specific rates.",

This probably occurs because the models used here are not severely overparameterized.

Overconfidence in incorrect branch lengths in terms of substitutions can cause bias in divergence-time estimates (Cutler 2000) . However, this form of model inadequacy is incorrectly identified by the methods we used for estimation as a form of rate variation among lineages. For our data generated using a strict clock and an underparameterized substitution model, the A index rejected the strict clock and supported the overparameterized uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock. On the other hand, the multinomial test statistic was sensitive to substitution model underparameterization, and to some forms of rate variation among lineages. The sensitivity of the multinomial likelihood to rate variation among lineages might explain why the substitution model was rejected for the coronavirus data set when using a clock model, but not when using a clock-free method. Due to this sensitivity and the substantial impact of substitution model misspecification, we recommend the use of a clock-free method to assess the substitution model before performing analyses using a clock model. Our results suggest that it is only advisable to perform a clock model analysis when an adequate substitution model is available.",

We recommend caution when interpreting estimates of evolutionary rates and timescales when the substitution model is inadequate. This typically suggests that the substitution process is not being modeled correctly, which can affect inferences of branch lengths regardless of whether a clock model is used or not. For this reason, the A index of 0.78 for the SIV data set might be overconfident compared with the same index obtained for the killer whale data.

Examining the estimates of specific branch lengths can indicate whether many of the node-age estimates are reliable, or whether important branches provide unreliable estimates. We recommend this practice when the substitution model has been deemed adequate and when a substantial proportion of the branch lengths are consistent with the clock model (i.e., when the A index is high). We note that the mitochondrial genomes of killer whales have the lowest A index of any data set when analyzed using a random local clock. This might occur because the model identified an average of 0-3 rate changes along the tree (0.79 rate changes; table 1). Although rate variation is likely to be higher in this data set, it might not be sufficiently high for the model to detect it.",

Again, the fact that the substitution model is inadequate precludes further interpretation of the estimates of evolutionary rates and timescales. This is a surprising result for a mitochondrial data set with several internal-node calibrations. A potential solution is to assess substitution-model adequacy for individual genes and to conduct the molecular clock analysis using only those genes for which an adequate substitution model is available.

In this study, we have presented a method of evaluating clock model adequacy, using a simple test statistic that can be computed efficiently. Assessment of clock model adequacy is an important complement to traditional methods of model selection for two primary reasons: It allows the researcher to reject all the available models if they are inadequate; and, as implemented in this study, it can be used to identify the branches with length estimates that are implausible under the assumed model. The results of our analyses of empirical data underscore the importance of evaluating the adequacy of the substitution and clock models. In some cases, several models might be adequate, particularly when they are overparameterized. In this respect, methods for traditional model selection are important tools because they can be used to select a single best-fitting model from a set of adequate models. Further research into methods, test statistics, and software for evaluating model adequacy is needed, both to improve the existing models and to identify data sets that will consistently provide unreliable estimates.",

We then simulated branch-specific rates under five clock model treatments using the R package NELSI (Ho et al. 2015) . This program simulates rates under a given model and multiplies rates by time to produce phylogenetic trees in which the branch lengths represent subs/site, known as phylograms. These phylograms were then used to simulate the evolution of DNA sequences of 2,000 nt in the R package phangorn. The five clock model treatments included the following: 1) A strict clock with a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 subs/site/My; 2) an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (Drummond et al. 2006) , with a mean rate of 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 subs/site/My and a standard deviation of 0.1; 3) a treatment in which a randomly selected clade with at least ten tips experienced an increase in the rate, representing a scenario with two local clocks (Yoder and Yang 2000) , with rates of 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 and 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 subs/ site/My; 4) a treatment with rate autocorrelation, with an initial rate of 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 subs/site/My and a parameter of 0.3 (Kishino et al. 2001) ; and 5) a treatment with rate variation that followed a beta distribution with equal shape parameters of 0.4 and centered at 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 subs/site/My, resulting in a bimodal shape. In every simulation, the mean rate was 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 subs/site/My, which is approximately the mean mitochondrial evolutionary rate in mammals, birds, nonavian reptiles, and amphibians (Pereira and Baker 2006) . We selected this mean rate instead of sampling from the prior because our estimation methods involved an uninformative rate prior, and random samples from this can produce data sets with high sequence saturation or with low information content. We used the Jukes-Cantor substitution model for simulation (Jukes and Cantor 1969) . This model allows us to avoid making arbitrary parameterizations of more parameter-rich models, which is not the focus of this study.",

            "text": "Assessing the Adequacy of Clock Models . doi:10.1093/molbev/msv154 MBE For each analysis of the empirical data sets, we ran the MCMC chain for 10 8 steps, with samples drawn from the posterior every 10 3 steps. We discarded the first 10% of the samples as burn-in and assessed satisfactory sampling from the posterior by verifying that the effective sample sizes for all parameters were above 200 using the R package CODA. We used stepping-stone sampling to estimate the marginal likelihood of the clock model (Gelman and Meng 1998; Lartillot and Philippe 2006; Xie et al. 2011) . For each Bayesian analysis, we performed posterior predictive simulations as done for the simulated data sets, and assessed the substitution model using the multinomial test statistic. In addition, to estimate the clock-free multinomial test statistic, we analyzed each of the empirical data sets using MrBayes 3.2 (Ronquist et al. 2012) . For these analyses we used the same chain length, sampling frequency, sampling verification method, and substitution model as in the analyses using clock models.Our empirical data sets included nucleotide sequences of coronaviruses. This data set contained 43 sequences of 638 nt of a portion of the M (matrix) gene, as used by Wertheim et al. (2013) . These sequences were sampled between 1941 and 2011. The best-fitting substitution model for this data set was GTR+G. We also used a data set of the gag gene of SIVs, which comprised 78 sequences of 477 nt, sampled between 1983 and 2004 (Wertheim and Worobey 2009). The best-fitting substitution model for this data set was GTR+G. We used the Bayesian skyline demographic model (Drummond et al. 2005) for the analyses of both of the virus data sets, and used the sampling times for calibration.We analyzed a data set of the killer whale (O. orca), which contained 60 complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 16,386 nt (Morin et al. 2010) . We calibrated the age of the root using a normal distribution with mean of 0.7 and a standard deviation of 5% of the mean, as used in the original study. The best-fitting substitution model for this data set was HKY+G. Finally, we analyzed a data set of several genera of marine turtles, which comprised 24 sequences of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes (Duchene et al. 2012) , and we selected the GTR+G substitution model. Following the scheme in the original study, we used calibrations at four internal nodes. The pure-birth process was used to generate the tree prior in the analyses of the killer whales and the marine turtles.",
