Hence, environmental pollution must be considered holistically and in the long term. To date, very few studies have assessed the spatialized, cumulative exposure to multiple pollutants (Bennett et al., 2014; Scarborough et al., 2012). In contrast, exposure to conventionally individual air pollutants has been intensively studied \u2013 usually by modelling annual mean concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and ozone (O3). Composite index groups together indicators of the various facets of a multiple exposure to air pollutants (European Commission et al., 2008). In this respect, spatialized composite indices are increasingly acknowledged to be valuable indicators for determining overall air quality (Occelli et al., 2016).",

All fatal and non-fatal CHD events whether hospitalised or not, recorded by public- or private-sector hospitals, emergency departments or at home that occurred in the study area were assessed. Multiple overlapping sources of case-ascertainment were used to document the CHD events. Medical and administrative sources were cross-checked to ensure the inclusion of all information (discharge letters, computer listings covering the diagnosis on hospital discharge, emergency department listings, death certificates, etc.). Cases of acute coronary events were documented on the basis of the clinical history and the hospital records. The clinical diagnoses were obtained from medical records. For each event, the patient's vital status was recorded. Information on this outcome was obtained directly from the patient's general practitioner, the city's registry office, or the national death certificate database. The causes of death were checked in hospital or autopsy records and by interviewing general practitioners. For the present study, we used data from the 2008\u20132011 period, which represented 5448 cases. As secondary prevention may affect outcome, only incident coronary events were considered here - yielding a total of 3268 cases.",

Lichens are exclusively dependent on the atmosphere for their nourishment, and absorb pollutants in the same way as essential elements (Loppi and Nascimbene, 2010).

Bennett's application of the Air Quality Indicator (which sums the emissions of benzene, NO2, SO2, and particulates) for small areas revealed a significant positive association with heart failure morbidity and mortality across the county of Warwickshire, UK (Bennett et al., 2014). Using the same indicator, Scarborough et al. found a small association with coronary heart mortality rates after adjustment for confounding variables among UK wards (Scarborough et al., 2012). In the present study, we calculated a composite index that provides an overall picture of air pollution. This makes it easier to integrate the complex nature of an environmental mixture into an ecological study. We found a 16% rise in the risk of incident CHD for the third tertile of SEnv, suggesting that a set of several pollutants have a cumulative impact on CHD. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that cumulative exposure to multiple low-dose air pollutants may generate cardiovascular complications.",

In agreement with these results, earlier studies have reported associations between monitored air pollutants and CHD hospitalizations and mortality rates. In the UK, Maheswaran et al. reported on significant elevated CHD mortality risks in the highest quintile of PM10 and NOx annual concentration exposures (1.17 [1.06\u20131.29] and 1.08 [0.96\u20131.20], respectively) (Maheswaran et al., 2005). Similarly, a study in Barcelona reported a significant association between CHD mortality and high levels of NO2 exposure in men (RR = 1.0084 [1.0035\u20131.0166] for one NO2 unit increment) (Barcel\u00f3 et al., 2009). However, the association with NO2 in women and with PM10 in men or women was not statistically significant. In California, a significant increment in CHD mortality rates in areas exposed to PM2.5 was reported, whatever the spatial exposure model used; the RR ranged from 1.20 [1.17\u20131.23] to 1.28 [1.25\u20131.32] for each 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in concentration (Garcia et al., 2016). A significant association between the SO2 concentration and the myocardial infarction hospitalization rate was found in southern France (Pascal et al., 2013). Compared with the reference concentration, the RRs were 1.13 [0.94\u20131.37] and 1.26 [1.02\u20131.57] for medium and high concentrations in men, respectively, and 1.38 [1.04\u20131.83] and 1.54 [1.14\u20132.10] in women, respectively. Together with these literature data, our present results suggest that some components of air pollution may increase the risk of CHD.",

In general, the epidemiologic literature has focused on the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, rather than the chemical composition of these particulates. In a systematic review of environmental metals and CVD, Nigra et al. highlighted the need to understand the role of metals (including exposure to metal mixtures) in the development of cardiovascular disease (Nigra et al., 2016). In the present study, we found a 17% rise in CHD incidence risk for the T3 of copper, a 14% rise for cadmium, a 13% rise for palladium and an 11% rise for nickel. Mechanistically, the elevated CHD risk might be due to the known adverse effects on intracellular and extracellular structures of an imbalance in the production and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. These consequences include greater lipid peroxidation, cell membrane damage, DNA damage, and oxidation of amino acids in proteins, and therefore change in these components' conformation and function. Oxidative modifications are considered to be early events in cardiovascular system dysfunction (Solenkova et al., 2014).",

While NO2 is primarily released into the air by the combustion engines of motor vehicles, metals can account for a large proportion of PMs in urban areas because particulate emissions near roads are also due to the wear of brakes, tires, other vehicle components and the road surface, as well as exhaust emissions (Jandacka et al., 2017). In the present study, these indicators were strongly correlated with SEnv, the highest values of which were observed close to main roads. We hypothesize that SEnv reflects a major influence of road traffic in the Lille urban area, a major agglomeration located at the crossroads of several European freight routes. These large flows of heavy goods vehicles are combined with large numbers of cars, as people commute to work. Thus, road traffic is likely to make the most important contribution to people's exposure in such urbanized area.",

Our results demonstrate the utility of these monitoring tools from an environmental health perspective. The study area is a densely populated metropolis with both urban and rural neighbourhoods, and a complex mixture of low-level air pollutants. The healthcare supply is dense, and so lack of access is unlikely to have an effect on the incidence of CHD. We used recently develop, validated statistical methods in spatial epidemiology. Our approach to air pollution is novel because we used data from lichen and plant biomonitoring, and a composite pollution index. Environmental biomonitoring might be able to track cumulative exposure over several years, and thus reflect the overall effects of environmental contamination. Consistent with other authors, our findings support the use of environmental biomonitoring as a tool to assess health effects of air pollution (Lequy et al., 2019). The exposure assessed by this approach can therefore be considered to have occurred before the observed health events.",

The environmental score calculated in this study considers cumulative exposure to 20 atmospheric pollutants, including NO2, particles, and heavy metals. These data came from different sources, and were provided in various formats and units and on various spatiotemporal scales. However, the methodology used to design our score helps to ensure interoperability. Although standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a robust statistical methodology to derive composite index from multivariate data, this leads a risk of overrepresentation of some pollutants compared to others. As we do not know which potential toxic effects each individual pollutant has on CHD, we favored rank normalization and unweighted aggregation for an explorative research. Through the sum of ranks, territories that accumulate high levels of contamination for all pollutants are identified as hot spots. This method guarantees the equal weighting of each variable in the overall score, regardless of the data distribution and variance. Furthermore, this method may not capture the spatial structure of each individual pollutant, and spatial autocorrelation. Geographically weighted PCA or PCA with spatial autocorrelation appears to be useful statistical techniques for these purposes (Dem\u0161ar et al., 2013), but these consequently involve a weighted aggregation.",
