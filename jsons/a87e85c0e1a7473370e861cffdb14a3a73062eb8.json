This outbreak of pneumonia was the emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 later named coronavirus disease 2019 or and continues summing cases in every continent in only a few months [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO) situation report 58 [2] , indicated that, as of the 18 th of March, there had been 191,127 confirmed cases and 7,807 deaths around the world. Due to its significant impact, the emergence of this novel coronavirus has been declared a pandemic [1] . The executive governmental branch of the U.S. has recently invoked the Defense Production Act to increase the domestic production of medical supplies necessary for fighting the current pandemic [3] . The purpose of this invocation will likely be use to drive private businesses to increase U.S. production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other critical medical supplies and devices. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S [4] .",

However, the use of commercially available antimicrobial materials [11] and the implementation of printing specifications settings resulting in fused extruded layers, can stop molecules down to 0.000282 \u03bcm, significantly smaller than viruses, such as the virus associated to COVID-19 (0.03 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcm) [16] . The recent elaboration of thermoplastics blends with antimicrobial copper nanocomposites is a direct and practical approach to produce antimicrobial thermoplastics [11] . The antimicrobial properties of copper, has been enhanced by two main factors [9, 12] . The first, is reducing the size of the copper particles to the nanoscale (10 nm) [10] increasing the volume of copper that can be added to a given solution or matrix as well as increasing the total surface area of the particles releasing a higher amount of metal ions [9, 12] . The second is incorporation of copper nanoparticles into polymer matrices [9, 12] . Copper nanoparticles on a polymer structure present a stronger antimicrobial effect than microparticles or metal surfaces by facilitating the adsorption of microorganisms on the polymer surface triggering the diffusion of water through the polymer matrix [12] . In turn, water with dissolved oxygen reaches the surface of embedded copper nanoparticles allowing the corrosion processes to take affect by releasing copper ions. Copper ions reach the composite surface damaging the microorganism cell membrane allowing the metal ions to enter the cell and damage DNA, RNA, and other biomolecules [12, 17] . The copper ions and associated hydroxyl radicals produces DNA denaturalization damaging helical structures [17] . This DNA and RNA damage has been shown to deactivate viruses [17] . Copper oxide affected free viruses, virions being formed within the cytoplasm of cells during the cell exposure to copper, and virions prior to their budding from the cells (Figure 1 ) [12, 17] . Furthermore, a previous investigation [11] showed that a commercially available antimicrobial additive manufacturing polymer (PLACTIVETM 1% copper nanoparticles composite, Copper3D, Santiago, Chile) was up to 99.99% effective against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Thus, the unprecedented need of biocidal polymers during a pandemic and the high accessibility of additive manufacturing equipment and materials can drive the implementation of this technology to revolutionize the manufacturing of critical medical devices when the supply chain is insufficient [9] .",

The study showed significant potential for the expanded use of a single ventilator during cases of disaster surge involving multiple casualties with respiratory failure. The study used a customized connector made of other readily available connective pieces to ventilate four lung simulators for 12 hours [18] . The main limitations of using a customized connector assembled with several connective pieces is the inability of reducing the size of the connector to minimize dead space volume [18] . Furthermore, repurposing connectors from other medical devices, can result in air leakage and infectious complications from sharing one ventilator. The use of antimicrobial polymers can facilitate the prototyping and clinical testing of these connectors with the objective of accelerating the production of the final product using conventional manufacturing methods, such as injection molding. The final production of these connectors could effectively expand the use of a single machine to ventilate four simulated adults experiencing respiratory failure due to COVID-19. The customization of the design can assist to minimize dead space volume and prevent air leakage due to unnecessary connections. During critical situations when doctors need to take lifeor-death decisions due to the lack of ventilator, the use of additive manufacturing would provide a feasible alternative for sharing the use of a single ventilator. Table 1 includes a list of open-source critical medical devices prototypes, including the 'H Connector' for standard ventilator and the antimicrobial NanoHack 2.0 face mask among others. Surgical masks are the most commonly used PPE by the general population, as well as health care workers. Surgical masks are effective in blocking large-particle droplets, but do not filter or block small particles in the air. The main reason, surgical masks do not provide complete protection is due to the loose fit between the surface of the mask and face allowing the entrance from small particle and large droplets. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends to safely discard used masks in a plastic bag and put it in the trash [19] . The last and crucial step to safely discard these masks is hand washing [19] . Previous published research [7] has suggested that the high viral load remaining in surgical masks can be a source of viral transmission both to the health care worker wearing the mask and to patients [7] . This may happen when healthcare workers touch their mask and then fail to wash their hands properly or when they dispose of the mask without proper safe disposal precautions [7] . Thus, the used of additive manufacturing using antimicrobial polymers to develop reusable face masks (Table 1) can significantly reduce the viral load remaining on the mask protecting the end-users from contamination during prolonged mask wearing [7] .",

The redox cycling between Cu2+ and Cu1+ can catalyze the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, which can subsequently damage cell membrane lipids, proteins, DNA, RNA, and other biomolecules. Once copper and associated hydroxyl radicals are inside of the cell, it produces DNA denaturalization damaging helical structures.

            "text": "The current limitations of using additive manufacturing to produce critical medical devices is the slow production time, verification of the quality of the print, and compliance with regulatory entities. The slow production time of additive manufacturing can be offset by the flexibility of using and transport a raw material to austere environments for final production. The industrial production of antimicrobial polymers and additive manufacturing of on-demand critical medical devices are described in Figure 2 . The ability to produce antimicrobial polymers using a renewable source that can be stored and transported as a raw material could significantly assist the current medical product supply chain disruptions involving the manufacturing of critical medical devices in austere clinical settings. It can be argued that current state of additive manufacturing may not be mature enough to develop a final product ready to be implemented in a clinical setting. However, the true benefits of accessible additive manufacturing techniques, such as fused deposition modeling, during a fast-developing pandemic are the ability to produce functional complex geometries both quickly and at low cost. These functional complex geometries and the rapid prototyping of experimental medical devices accelerates the developing process of a final product of a medical device and its implementation. The use of more sophisticated additive manufacturing methods and materials, such as Selective Laser Sintering and Polyamide 12 powdered thermoplastic polymers embedded with copper nanoparticles composite would significantly improve the durability facilitating the implementation of antimicrobial medical devices in clinical settings. The use of additive manufacturing of critical medical devices has facilitated efforts of international groups, such as the Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies Group (International) and Hack the Pandemic (Copper3D Inc) to respond to disruptions to the medical product supply chain by providing alternative options to access critical medical devices. As additive manufacturing technology matures and continues to permeate varied industries and products, it is apparent that some level of regulation must be developed to ensure consistent quality and reproducibility across fabrication types, manufacturers and materials. A recent FDA Draft Guidance titled 'Technical Considerations for Additive Manufactured Devices' [20] serves as a first step toward defining government policy regarding the use of additive manufacturing for critical medical devices. These regulatory efforts validate the use of additive manufacturing to rapid prototype critical medical devices and accelerate the process of final production and implementation. It is feasible that within a 5-year period, additive manufacturing and the use of antimicrobial polymers will play a crucial role in the development of on-demand and implementation of antimicrobial critical medical devices in clinical settings.
