The first report on February 20 of a severe case of coronavirus disease 19 (CoViD-19) in a fit, young male from Codogno, a town just south of Milan, was rapidly followed by the identification of clusters of infected patients in the densely populated Lombardia region (approximately 10 million inhabitants with a density of 421.6 inhabitants/sq km) and in nearby regions within Northern Italy. 2 Our hospital, Policlinico San Donato Research Hospital, is a university hospital located in the southeastern part of the Milan metropolitan area, where it represents one of the largest clinics in the territory. Our daily activity as gastroenterologists was immediately affected. We promptly implemented a strategy of phone call screenings before any gastrointestinal (GI) consults or endoscopic procedures, questioning patients about their geographic provenance (prohibiting patients from coming from the so-called red zone, the area surrounding Codogno), suspicious symptoms, and high-risk contacts. We had just started to contemplate how to safely continue our endoscopic activities in the absence of clear indications regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when within a few days the regional health system was overwhelmed by a massive number of CoViD-19 patients. Lombardia rapidly became one of the most severely affected regions of the world, with 54,802 infected individuals, identified by performing 176,953 nasopharyngeal swabs, and 10,022 deaths by April 9. 3 On March 8, the entire region was declared a red zone, and 2 days later a complete national lockdown was declared.",

A small internal medicine ward, dedicated to care for the few noninfected patients accessing the hospital for urgent medical conditions, was preserved and also used for GI emergencies. In 2 weeks our hospital, like many others in Northern Italy, was almost completely converted into a CoViD-19 hospital. Every possible effort was made to quickly increase the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) to accommodate the alarming numbers of very sick CoViD-19 patients, including constructing new units in unused areas of the hospital or converting surgical rooms into ICUs.",

Many were anxious about the necessity to postpone their already planned consults or endoscopies, and others were truly terrified of the idea of coming to the hospital for scheduled infusions or visits.

Anecdotally, IBD patients do not appear to be at higher risk of developing CoViD-19 compared with the general population. In fact, the Chinese Elite IBD Union did not identify any SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in their patient registry, 4 and to date only a few infected IBD patients have been reported in the literature. Nonetheless, although these data are quite encouraging, solid epidemiologic evidence from areas with high IBD prevalence, such as in Western countries, is lacking at the present time and it is unclear whether the observations in China can be extrapolated to the rest of the IBD patient population worldwide. As such, although it is reasonable to reassure patients, this does not mean that they can ignore general precautions. Indeed, the single most important intervention we can engage in to protect our patients with IBD is to emphasize the importance of \"primary prevention\": that is, avoiding, as much as possible, the risk of getting infected. This is especially true in frail patients-specifically, elderly or malnourished patients, those with several comorbidities, and those with long-standing aggressive disease-who respond poorly to current treatments. These particular IBD patients, with the aforementioned conditions, are highly likely to be at significant increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

The possibility of orofecal transmission, suggested by the findings of viral RNA in stool even after patients have tested negative by nasopharyngeal swab, 5 has to be considered. Routine use of PPE is still a matter of debate. Although not currently recommended by the World Health Organization because of the lack of evidence, 6 the use of masks, even in the absence of symptoms, appears reasonable to us. In any case, the use of PPE (eg, masks and gloves) has rapidly and widely become commonplace among the general population. From this perspective, our role is also to inform patients how to correctly use these PPE devices, because incorrect behavior may paradoxically increase the risk of infection: for example, by touching the outer side of the mask, reusing the same mask for several days, touching the face with gloves, and removing gloves improperly. In addition, the need to comply with social distancing recommendations, avoiding crowded places, and not leaving home unless necessary must be stressed as much as possible. It is important to explain that coming to hospitals for nonurgent procedures or consultations is an unnecessary risk that should be absolutely avoided.",

We have managed to have at least one person (GI-or IBD-dedicated nurse) available 24/7 to answer e-mails and phone calls. This more \"passive\" approach may be adequate for patients with mild, stable disease. However, for patients on biologic therapies, we have implemented a mandatory phone call-in the day before any planned hospital visit to screen for possible CoViD-19 symptoms or contact with infected individuals and to reassure patients that all possible precautions are being taken by the IBD center to reduce the risk of infection. Clinical conditions of patients on subcutaneous biologics can usually be checked by phone call; in addition, whenever possible, we use drug delivery services, established by the National Health System, specifically to provide hospital-dispensed medications to patients during this pandemic.",

Accordingly, the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 10 recommends not stopping biologic therapies, including infusion therapies administered in hospitals, assuming that the infusion center provides an adequate screening protocol. We agree that in these patients the risk of causing a disease relapse when interrupting biologic therapies is probably higher than the risk of developing severe CoViD-19 because of the effects of immunomodulation; however, every effort should be made to protect them from the risk of infection. In hospitals where CoViD-19 patients are treated (like ours), the delineation of well-defined \"clean\" pathways is pivotal to minimize the risks of infection for non-CoViD-19 patients. If possible, medical and nonmedical personnel involved at the infusion center should be excluded from the care of CoViD-19 patients.

However, in the early stages (the viral phase of infection) they should be avoided because their use may increase viral burden. The recommendation to reduce as much as possible or discontinue systemic steroids in IBD patients given by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease appears reasonable, but the decision should be made on an individual basis, discussing the benefits and risks with each patient. Of course, steroid tapering (especially if accelerated) should always be conducted under strict medical surveillance, possibly with planned follow-up phone calls and, in any case, ensuring unlimited availability by phone.

Our center normally handles 10-15 ongoing clinical trials, and randomized clinical trials on novel therapeutic compounds are an important resource we use in the management of IBD patients. However, as many of us know, great efforts are commonly required to properly conduct these studies, in compliance with more and more complex protocols. As one may expect, advancing study procedures with a significant reduction of resources has become quite challenging. Still, it is critical for the patients, and for the IBD center, to do whatever is necessary to guarantee continuation of the trial(s) by enrolling patients and avoiding, as much as possible, protocol deviations. Even more so than routine biologic infusions, particular attention should be paid to observing clean pathways and the use of PPE to avoid potential hospital infections. In addition, the reporting of adverse events should be precise and carefully monitored to separate potential confounding factors because of the current situation. Overall, although we are assuring our patients, particularly those who were already enrolled in clinical trials at the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, that our intent is to continue these studies, at present we are also carefully evaluating any new possible enrollments because of the aforementioned difficulties that may impact our ability to properly conduct these trials.",

As already mentioned, in many hospitals gastroenterologists have had to be reassigned and are now directly involved in the care of CoViD-19 patients. Even if urgent consults and endoscopic procedures are granted (a 24/7 referral service is maintained for emergent endoscopies), this reorganization adds further difficulties to the management of patients with acute GI diseases who deserve admission. As an example, acute reactivation of IBD has other unique features that may further complicate patient management. First, coronavirus infection may present with GI symptoms, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain, accompanied by mild to moderate fever and no (or mild) respiratory symptoms. 13 As such, CoViD-19 may mimic IBD relapse symptoms, adding one more diagnostic challenge to this patient population. Moreover, the intense pressure on the emergency system plus patients' fear of being admitted to an \"infected\" hospital may cause delays in the diagnosis and treatment of acute flares, consequently increasing the risk of medical treatment failure and the need for urgent surgical intervention (eg, in patients with severe ulcerative colitis). In many hospitals, medical and even surgical units have been converted to CoViD-19 units. As such, even if surgeons are still available for urgent cases, another problem to take into account is the availability of ICU beds in hospitals overwhelmed with CoViD-19 patients. In fact, it is very likely that ICUs are completely occupied by critical CoViD-19 patients and that there is no room for \"clean\" patients.",
