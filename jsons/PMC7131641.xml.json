Clinical signs and lesions may be mild, as in porcine neonatal colitis (Songer and Anderson, 2006, Songer, 2005), but range to elevated leukocyte count, abdominal pain, profuse watery diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, and death in humans. Collective pathology is comprised of pseudomembrane formation, inflammation, necrosis, and an intercryptal exudate of neutrophils and fibrin (\u201cvolcano lesions\u201d) (Keel and Songer, 2006). Toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) are apparently foremost among the virulence factors of C. difficile (Keel and Songer, 2006, Songer and Anderson, 2006).",

Our findings revealed C. difficile toxins in more than 25% of calves, and nearly 40% of these were strongly positive. Incidence peaked at 1\u20132 weeks of age (Porter et al., 2002). Rodriguez-Palacios et al. (2006) obtained isolates of C. difficile from stools of 11.2% of 144 diarrheic (7.6%) and 134 nondiarrheic (14.9) calves. Seven of the eight PCR ribotypes isolated have been found in humans with CDAD, and two (017 and 027) have caused severe human disease. Toxins were detected in feces from 39.6% of diarrheic calves and 20.9% of controls. In both cases, differences were statistically significant (p\n \u2264 0.0009). These results (Porter et al., 2002, Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006) suggested an association of C. difficile with calf diarrhea, and a possible bovine reservoir of infection for humans. Results of the present work strengthen the view that this organism may be associated with calfhood diarrheas.",

The rate of isolation from toxin or culture positive calves was not significantly different from that in negative calves (Table 3\n). Large populations of E. coli were found in significantly more samples from diarrheic calves [59 of 253 (23.3%)] than from nondiarrheic animals [3 of 53 (5.7%); p\n < 0.005]. Most samples yielding large numbers of E. coli (43 of 62, 69.4%) were from calves \u22642 weeks of age (data not shown). Routine PCR genotyping failed to reveal genes encoding heat labile or stable toxins, pili (K99, F18, 987P, K88, or F41), or Shiga-like toxin 2e (data not shown). Thus, the significance of these findings is unknown; however, finding large numbers of this organism in pure culture in diarrheic stools suggests that it may have been an etiologic agent. Examination for virulence factor genes was not exhaustive, and if these E. coli strains were producing a clinical response, it may have been by virtue of other factors, known or unknown. Only two specimens (one C. difficile culture positive and one culture and toxin negative, both from diarrheic calves) yielded both Salmonella sp. and E. coli. No samples from diarrheic calves and yielding large numbers of E. coli in pure culture were also examined for coronavirus, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium sp., and Giardia sp. (see below). These data on co-infecting agents are limited, and are perhaps best viewed as providing a basis for hypotheses on which to plan future experimental work.",

Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic (Table 4\n; p\n = 0.001), but differences in rates of rotavirus and Giardia sp. detection were not significant. The impact of these figures is lessened by the small number of observations in some cells (e.g., Giardia sp.). Among stools from nondiarrheic calves, those testing positive for toxins were most likely to contain the viral and protozoal pathogens (data not shown). Only two toxin positive samples from diarrheic calves tested positive for any of these four pathogens (one for Crytptosporidium sp. and one for Giardia sp.) and only five toxin negative samples from diarrheic calves tested positive (one for coronavirus and rotavirus, two for Cryptosporidium sp., and one for Giardia sp.). C. difficile culture positive specimens also containing these additional pathogens were rare (four from nondiarrheic calves, none from diarrheic). Among culture negative samples, additional agents were uncommon in stools from diarrheic calves (1\u20133 positives in 23 samples), but 30.3% (10/33) and 60.6% (20/33) of samples from nondiarrheic calves were positive for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp., respectively. C. difficile-positive specimens (by culture and/or toxin detection) were no more likely to be positive for any of these pathogens than C. difficile-negative specimens. Our results are somewhat different than those in a case: control study (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2006) which suggested that frequent demonstration of Cryptosporidium sp. in diarrheic calves did not confound a conclusion that C. difficile caused the diarrhea. Among specimens tested for all seven pathogens, six (two from diarrheic calves and four from nondiarrheic) were toxin positive and negative for all other pathogens; one specimen (from a nondiarrheic calf) was culture positive and negative for the others. Thus, the general trend is toward higher rates of these pathogens (with the possible exception of Giardia sp.) in C. difficile-positive calves. However, these data are limited in scope and support no firm conclusions, but suggest both the need and a direction for further study.",

            "text": "Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antimicrobials for calf isolates were somewhat lower than those for swine isolates (Table 5\n; Post and Songer, 2004). MICs for control strains were within limits prescribed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (Benning and Mathers, 1999, National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 2001). Others have reported in vitro anti-clostridial activity of tylosin (Dutta et al., 1983), and our findings concur; MICs50 for erythromycin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were relatively low (0.25\u20130.50 \u03bcg/mL). Lack of bimodal distribution of susceptibility to erythromycin and tylosin suggests that erythromycin resistance elements encountered in strains from other species (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980, Delmee and Avesani, 1988, Farrow et al., 2001, Post and Songer, 2004) may be rare in this population. Human strains vary widely in susceptibility to tetracycline (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980, Delmee and Avesani, 1988), but with the exception of a single outlier (susceptible at 0.125 \u03bcg/mL), these calf strains were susceptible only at 8\u201316 \u03bcg/mL. The low MIC90 for virginiamycin (0.125 \u03bcg/mL) suggests that these strains may be susceptible in vivo, in contrast to strains from pigs, for which the MIC90 was 16 \u03bcg/mL (Post and Songer, 2004). Bacitracin had little activity against calf strains (MIC90 64 \u03bcg/mL), in keeping with results for human, porcine, and equine strains (Jang et al., 1997, Citron et al., 2001, Post and Songer, 2004). High MICs reported for cephalosporins (Dzink and Bartlett, 1980, Chow et al., 1985, Post and Songer, 2004) mirror our results for ceftiofur (MIC90 128 \u03bcg/mL). Positive clinical outcomes seem unlikely for agents with an MIC higher than recommended doses.",

Superficial mucosal erosions and neutrophil infiltration occurred in the jejunal, ileal, and colonic mucosa. Mucus, fibrin, neutrophils, and sloughed epithelial cells accumulated in the lumen of a loop in mid-spiral colon (Table 6\n).

Epithelium in a loop in upper spiral colon was hemorrhagic and necrotic, and neutrophils and lymphocytes infiltrated lacteals.

Purified TcdA and TcdB caused tissue damage, fluid accumulation, and neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that in vivo toxin production may lead to development of similar lesions. In counterpoint, calves inoculated with C. difficile (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2007) became colonized, but neither toxins nor signs of enteric disease were detected. Further work with experimental inoculation, under various conditions, will be required to conclusively establish C. difficile as an etiologic agent.
