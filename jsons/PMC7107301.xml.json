The primers used were as follows: promoter, forward: 5\u2032-GCCAGAAAGTAGAGAGGTATTTAGCAC-3\u2032; internal primer exon 1, forward: 5\u2032-CAGGTGTCTAGGCACAGATGAACC-3\u2032; and exon 1, reverse: 5\u2032-CCAACACGTACCTGGTTCCC-3\u2032. In brief, 10 ng of genomic DNA was amplified in a 20-\u00b5L volume of reaction mixture containing 1\u00d7 PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.4], 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM of MgCl2), 0.125 mM of dNTPs, 0.25 mM of each primer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on a PTC-200 Thermal cycler (MJ Research, United States). Thermal cycling parameters for amplification of both exon 1 and promoter regions were 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes (initial denaturation); 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C (for denaturation), 30 seconds at 68\u00b0C (for annealing), 90 seconds at 72\u00b0C (for extension); and 120 second at 72\u00b0C (for final extension). PCR products were cleaned up by use of Exo-SAP-IT (USB, Affymetrix, United States), and 1 \u00b5L of the purified product was directly used as a template for sequencing, using the BigDye terminator v. 1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, United States) on an ABI 3130XL DNA sequencer, according to the manufacturers' instructions.

We observed a significantly different distribution of serum MBL levels both in the SEP group and the SELP group among the investigated genotypes that were associated with differential serum MBL levels (Figure 3). In both observed distributions, the genotype YA/YA (high MBL producers) had an increased MBL levels, compared with the other genotypes in the studied population. No significant correlations were observed with the egg counts and serum levels (data not shown).\n",

In our recent study, we demonstrated that FCN2 polymorphisms and ficolin-2 levels influence the outcome of schistosomiasis [39]. Similar to ficolins, MBL is an innate immune recognition protein that plays a vital role during the early phase of infection and pathogen recognition. Additionally, our studies have documented the involvement of MBL-activated complement in the response to Schistosoma antigens in vitro [13]. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the sugar-rich surface of Schistosoma organisms is a good target for MBL and that single-locus substitutions in MBL2 resulting in variation in MBL production would eventually affect the disease outcome. In this study, we investigated the possible association of MBL serum levels and MBL2 variants in a case-control study, using 2 independent control groups. The classification of the control group is indispensable in Schistosoma-endemic areas, as it is difficult to differentiate individuals with and without a current infection.",

In our study, we observed that promoter genotypes (\u2212550H/L) influence predisposition to schistosomiasis. The heterozygous genotype (\u2212550HL) conferred protection against infection, whereas the homozygous genotype (\u2212550LL) contributed to increased susceptibility. The results remained consistent when egg-positive patients (the SEP group) were compared to individuals in the SELN group, with or without individuals in the SELP group. The \u2212550H minor allele in the studied population decreased the risk of Schistosoma infection. Our results imply that individuals who are heterozygous at promoter position \u2212550H/L are less susceptible to infection. As observed in our study, earlier studies have documented the influence of \u2212550H/L variants on the risk of HIV infection and AIDS progression in Italian children [34] and on prosthetic joint infection in Czech patients [42]. However, another study, which investigated the association of MBL2 variants with Bechet disease in a South Korean population, demonstrated that the patients had lower frequencies of the homozygous genotype (\u2212550LL) [43]. This variation emphasizes that the clinical significance of the MBL2 variants may likely depend on the population and the disease context. We also observed that a noncoding SNP located +4 bp from the transcription start site (+4P/Q) was also observed to influence the predisposition to schistosomiasis, as determined by comparison of the SEP group to the SELN group. The individuals with major allele homozygous genotypes (+4PP) were less susceptible to infection than those in the SELN group, whereas the individuals with heterozygous genotypes (+4PQ) had a higher risk of infection than those in the SELN group. However, we did not observe significant associations with pooled values for the control groups.",

No significant associations were observed in the distribution of genotypes (MBL2*C independently and with the combined promoter-220 + exon 1) that influences the serum MBL levels. This observed MBL2*C genotype was documented to be the most frequent African MBL2 variant [31], and studies have reported that the MBL2*C variant is associated with placental malaria and malaria in African children [31, 44]. A heterozygous 6-bp deletion (wt/del) in the promoter region was observed to confer increased risk to schistosomiasis in comparisons between the SEP group and the SELN group. These results are in accordance with those of another study, which demonstrated that the 6-bp deletion at position \u2212328 was correlated with HIV type 1 infection [34]. The reconstruction of haplotypes is important to revealing how different combinations of functional polymorphic alleles can interact to modulate their individual effects. Moreover, many studies have shown the effect of MBL2 haplotypes in disease association studies [32, 35, 43]. Stratification of our cohort on the basis of MBL2 haplotype showed that the MBL2*HYPA haplotype was significantly lower in the case group than in controls, elucidating the fact that individuals with these haplotypes had a lower risk of schistosomiasis. Similar results on the influence of MBL2*HYPA haplotypes has been demonstrated in Bechet disease, in pediatric patients with common infectious diseases, and in patients with colon cancer [23, 43, 45].",

A significant difference was found between the SEP group and both the SELP group alone and the SELP and SELN groups combined. MBL serum levels were significantly higher in the control groups, compared with the case group, showing that high levels of MBL may have a protective role in reducing the susceptibility to S. haematobium infection and adding further support the view that MBL plays a role in first-line defense against this pathogen. The MBL2*HYPA haplotypes that contributed to a decreased risk of schistosomiasis were also correlated significantly to MBL serum levels. The control groups (the SELP group alone and the SELP and SELN groups combined) had significantly higher MBL serum levels, compared with the case group. MBL2 polymorphisms related to higher MBL levels in serum were associated with decreased susceptibility to respiratory tract infection in children [46] and to SARS coronavirus infection, compared with controls [22]. The role of MBL as a first line of defense in infectious and noninfectious diseases has been documented in many clinical settings. Comparable results from our study were reported in individuals infected with the intestinal protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium, in which MBL2 polymorphisms and haplotypes that were associated with deficient serum MBL levels increased the susceptibility to infection [30]. On the contrary, MBL2 polymorphisms were also reported to play a dual role in leprosy [32]: the wild-type haplotype was shown to increase susceptibility to the disease per se, and defective haplotypes were shown to confer protection against lepromatous and borderline leprosy. Therefore, depending on the type of disease, MBL deficiency may increase susceptibility to intestinal parasite infections, as in cryptosporidium and schistosomiasis, or may be protective against intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium leprae [32]. In our study, a normal MBL level was found to decrease the susceptibility to S. haematobium infection.",

Both MBL and l-ficolin have similar structural templates comprising collagen-like and ligand binding domains that binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the pathogen surface. In association with the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP1 and MASP2), MBL and l-ficolin initiate the complement lectin cascade, leading to clearance of pathogens by opsonization [47, 48]. A previous study showed that the surfaces of both S. mansoni cercariae and adult worms were recognized specifically by the MBL-MASP complex, suggesting that an interaction between MBL and the parasite results in activation of complement in vitro [13]. Lectin-binding studies of Schistosoma organisms have revealed many different glycoproteins on the surface of the parasite, regardless of life cycle stage and sex [38, 49], and it was shown MBL interacts with these sugar residues on the parasite surface, triggering the host immune response [13, 50].
