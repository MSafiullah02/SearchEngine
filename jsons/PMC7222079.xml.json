In currently published guidelines from medical bodies such as the Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy for Pediatrics, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Swiss Society of Neonatology, and the Belgian and Flemish Societies of Neonatology and Paediatrics, there is a lack of consensus regarding the best time to review empiric antibiotic treatment for EOS [3]. In Malaysia, disagreements exist between the 4th edition of Paediatric Protocols and 3rd edition of the National Antibiotic Guideline (NAG), with the time recommended to review empiric treatment in EOS listed as 48\u201372 h and 36 h, respectively [4\u20136].",

Nearly half of them underwent empiric antibiotic de-escalation within 72 h, while the remaining patients continued treatment beyond 72 h.

They are cesarean section delivery, exposure to antenatal steroids, nil history of maternal pyrexia, absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and normal baseline CRP. A cesarean section delivery was classified as a clean-contaminated operation, with a risk of infection and endometritis to the operative mother, but no additional risk of EOS to the neonate, since there was no contact with the birth canal during the delivery process [39, 40]. Exposure to antenatal steroids was also a predictive indicator for de-escalation practice. To accelerate fetal lung maturation and improve neonatal respiratory function upon delivery, antenatal steroids are given to mothers at risk of premature delivery or elective cesarean before 38 weeks gestation [41]. A study by Gyamfi-Bannerman et al. (2016) at the Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine Units Network of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development reported that completing two doses of antenatal steroids was not associated with an increased risk of EOS [42].",

They are nil history of maternal pyrexia and absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Maternal pyrexia is a risk factor listed in most guidelines and is a criterion to start empiric antibiotic therapy [16, 43]. Nonetheless, previous studies reported that only about 6.4% of evaluated neonates were infected when the maternal recorded temperature was 38.9 \u00b0C, with reduced risk as temperature drops [16, 43, 44]. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was not considered as a criterion to start empiric antibiotics, as meconium aspiration syndrome presented in only 5% of meconium-stained amniotic fluid cases [45, 46]. Therefore, if neonates are clinically well without risks of maternal pyrexia and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, empiric antibiotics de-escalation can safely be implemented.",

However, it has a low sensitivity for indicating neonatal sepsis, as its levels rise in non-infectious events as well [47, 48]. CRP concentration may appear normal in the early stage of infection, and it has limited predictive value in the single figures, due to physiological variations in the first few days of life [7]. Serial CRP in the first 24\u201348 h of symptoms increases test sensitivity and can be helpful in determining the duration of empiric antibiotic use [7, 16, 49, 50]. However, in this study, serial CRP to guide treatment decisions was not a routine practice.",

Therefore, results cannot be generalized. Besides, this study did not use the Kaiser risk assessment calculator to determine whether an antibiotic should be started for EOS [51]. Instead, the criteria used was based on our local reference Pediatric Protocols (4th edition) as this was the reference commonly used by the physicians at our study sites. Hence, there could be a possibility that an antibiotic was started even though the EOS risk was low according to the Kaiser risk assessment. It is not surprising that most of the identified factors in this study are factors currently included in the Kaiser risk assessment. Despite the limitations, to our knowledge, this is the first local study investigating factors associated with empiric antibiotic de-escalation among neonates with suspected EOS.",
