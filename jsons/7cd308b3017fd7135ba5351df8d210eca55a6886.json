Therefore, most of the recently infected cases have been reported in Europe and the Americas, the outbreak seems to have subsided in the Western Pacific Region. However, some island countries or territories have recently reported new imported and local transmission COVID-19 cases, including in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Guam, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia. 1 Given uneven resources for emergencies and inadequate health security capacities in Western Pacific Island countries and territories, 4 it would cause a serious crisis if COVID-19 broke out in these areas. However, there is currently few research reporting on the pandemic status in the Western Pacific Islands.",

Asian countries close to the epicenter of the outbreak have seen earlier cases of infection, which is consistent with the transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2, that is, relatively frequent interpersonal interactions in the early stages of the pandemic contributed to the prevalence of COVID-19. 5, 6 Although the number of new cases seems to have leveled off across the Western Pacific Region, which may due to the timely strict measures, the suppressed infection growth rate in heavily infected countries, such as China and South Korea (Figure 2 ), does not indicate that transmission in these areas has been blocked. In particular, the number of reported infections is still growing in the Western Pacific islands (Figure 2 ). Compared with other countries in this region, there is a significant lag in the onset time of initial infected cases in these islands, possibly reflecting the remote location of and inconvenient transportation to Western Pacific Islands.",

Economic globalization, trade, and population mobility have exacerbated the challenges of infectious disease control. Commercial and trade facilities allow infectious diseases to quickly cross the political borders of sovereign states, leading to the global spread of diseases. Due to the discontinuity between lands in the Western Pacific Island countries and territories, the extensive networks of frequent population mobility here also facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. 12, 13 Previous studies have confirmed that infectious diseases depopulated isolated Pacific islands when they were first exposed to global pathogen spread. 14 Fortunately, a Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System (PSSS) has been established for early warning of infectious diseases. 15, 16 It is an urgent need to further improve and scientifically enable this system to inhibit the spread of COVID-19 in this special period.",
