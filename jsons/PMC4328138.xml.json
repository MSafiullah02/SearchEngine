For example, pseudomembranous colitis as a result of overgrowth of toxin-producing Clostridium\ndifficile in the colon can present with hematochezia and multiorgan failure.55 Enteritis necroticans, known as pigbel in Papua New Guinea, is a segmental necrotizing infection of the jejunum and ileum caused by Clostridium perfringens, type C.56, 57\n",

The largest involved 8 cases of NEC with a 25% mortality rate and noted that, in comparison with nonoutbreak NEC cases, those associated with norovirus had significantly lower levels of neutrophil band forms.149 An outbreak of 8 cases of norovirus among premature infants was marked by abdominal distention, apnea, and increased gastric residuals. Vomiting and acute diarrhea were not predominant clinical features (27% and 0%, respectively), but one infant with proven norovirus developed NEC.150 A case-control study noted an increased prevalence of norovirus in stools of infants with NEC compared with non-NEC controls (40% vs 9%, respectively) and suggested an etiologic role of norovirus in the pathogenesis of NEC.16\n",

Rates of perinatal CMV infection in premature infants have been reported to be as high as 15% to 20%.151, 152 Given their immunocompromised status, premature infants are at particular risk for postnatal infection from breast milk (transmission rates 5%\u201337%)153, 154, 155 or via transfused blood products.156, 157, 158, 159 Among immunocompromised patients, CMV enteritis is common and marked by diarrhea, hematochezia, and toxic megacolon.160 In infants, however, CMV enteritis is unusual; the virus is a disputed player in the development of NEC. Patients may present with diarrhea or with disease resembling NEC but without distinguishing features, such as intestinal pneumatosis.161 However, several case reports linking confirmed cases of NEC to CMV infections have been reported, with clinical manifestations including abdominal compartment syndrome,162 viremia and sepsis,163 and colonic strictures.164 In one particularly severe case, fulminant NEC leading to death was associated with stool culture positive for CMV but with a notable reduction in diversity of bacterial flora, prompting speculation that intestinal CMV infection may predispose infants to NEC by altering intestinal immune responses and promoting secondary bacterial infection.165\n",

In one study, none of 7 infants with NEC had viable fungal organisms detected in stool.194 Further complicating the picture is the frequent association of Candida with SIP.195, 196 When Candida is linked to NEC, however, the results can be severe197; 27% of fatal cases of surgically treated NEC were associated with Candida sepsis, an outcome complicated by late diagnosis occurring either within 48 hours of death or at autopsy.198 On pathologic examination of 84 patients with NEC, yeast and pseudohyphae were detected in both the intestinal lumen and wall.199 Antifungal prophylaxis has been shown in a randomized controlled trial200 to have benefit in reducing both colonization and invasive disease201, 202 but not NEC201 or overall mortality.203\n",

            "text": "NEC is a common and devastating problem for premature infants. Bacterial colonization seems to be a necessary but not sufficient contributor to NEC. Although intestinal pathogens may cause NEC-like illness in animal models or occasional clinical outbreaks, they are not detected in most cases of classic NEC.204 NEC outbreaks have been associated with clusters of viral GI infections, but the clinical presentation may vary and often affect the large intestine. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of host-specific GI tract microbial communities on the development of NEC.Best practices\nWhat is the current practice?\nNEC\nThe guidelines of the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend fluid resuscitation, bowel decompression, antimicrobial therapy, and surgical intervention (laparotomy or drainage) if needed.18 Recommended antibiotics for complicated intra-abdominal infections in infants include combinations of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime with or without anaerobic coverage with metronidazole, piperacillin-tazobactam, or meropenem.17, 18 In spite of their frequent use, the safety and efficacy of various antimicrobial combination treatment strategies for NEC has not been established in randomized controlled trials. The American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Clinical Trials Committee advises probiotics to decrease the incidence of NEC, and human milk should be used when possible.209 They conclude that there is a lack of evidence-based data to support definitive recommendations for the type of surgical treatment or length of antimicrobial therapy.\nWhat changes in current practice are likely to improve outcomes?Prevention of NEC is the most effective strategy because once the disease becomes clinically evident, a mucosal and systemic inflammatory cascade has already been activated and multiorgan injury is likely. For the same reasons, earlier diagnosis of NEC before clinical onset is an important goal.210\n\n\nMajor recommendations\nMedical management consists of bowel decompression, discontinuation of enteral feedings and medications, maintaining intravascular volume and electrolyte balance, and initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics based on known sensitivities of prevalent pathogens in the individual NICU. Typical regimens include ampicillin plus gentamicin to cover for common intestinal bacteria. Often the addition of a third antibiotic that provides more targeted anaerobic coverage (eg, clindamycin or metronidazole) is indicated when there is evidence of pneumatosis or bowel perforation. As an alternative, piperacillin-tazobactam may offer the advantage of broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage including typical anaerobes of the intestinal flora. However, downsides are variable penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and concerns for the emergence of drug resistance. Second-line therapy for severely ill infants can include meropenem and vancomycin in cases of positive cultures with resistant organisms, possible central nervous system infection, perforated bowel, and/or failed first-line or alternative therapy. Almost all of the drugs mentioned do not have a Food and Drug Administration label for use in this population because safety and efficacy data are lacking. Supportive management may require respiratory and blood pressure support and correcting anemia and thrombocytopenia and/or other coagulation defects. Serial abdominal radiographs are often recommended to monitor for intestinal pneumatosis, portal venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum. Early consultation with a pediatric surgeon is advised. Intestinal perforation or evidence of bowel necrosis is a common indication for operative management. As a preventive measure, a more consistent practice style including the implementation of early breast milk feedings, standardized feeding regimens, and reduction of unnecessary antibiotics is recommended.\nClinical algorithms\nThe management of patients with NEC (medical and/or surgical) can be guided by Bell staging criteria as reported recently by Sharma and Hudak211 (Fig. 1\n).\nRating for the strength of the evidence\n\nC (Recommendation based on consensus, usual practice, expert opinion, disease-oriented evidence, and case series for studies of diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or screening)\nSummary statementNEC is a multifactorial disease, but bacteria and other microorganisms have been uniformly implicated somewhere along the pathogenic process. Because no specific microorganism can be considered causative in most cases of NEC, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy remains a mainstay in NEC treatment. More research is needed to determine the optimum therapy and to develop effective strategies for NEC prevention.\n\nData from Refs.17, 18, 209, 210, 211\n\n",
