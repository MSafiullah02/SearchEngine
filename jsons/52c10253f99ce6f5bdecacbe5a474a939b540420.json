A total of 1,732 volunteers living with clustered distributions joined in the project. From study initiation, managers and Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs) explored and optimized a comprehensive management modality for the treatment of AIDS with CM. In this article, we will introduce this management method and its effi ciency on the treatment of AIDS with CM, which was used successfully for almost 10 years in Henan Province, China.",

The modality includes: one primary concept, four basic foundations, six important relationships, and four key sections. The primary concept is patient-centered medicine, which is derived from CM theory. The four foundations include classifying administrative region management, the characteristics of CM on disease treatment, health resource conditions, and the distribution of PLWH. The \"three uniformities and three combinations\" are the guiding principles of CM treatment, and the four key segments include: management, operation, records, and evaluation. The UGC is an effective management modality for AIDS treatment with CM in China, which might be useful as a reference for other developing countries or resource-limited areas.",
