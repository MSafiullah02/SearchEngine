Both age (P < .0001) and role (P = .03) influenced the types of news sources utilized by study participants when seeking out everyday information. To obtain everyday news, 203 younger individuals preferred social media sources, whereas older individuals preferred 204 traditional news sources(Figure 1). In the event of an equine disease outbreak, role was an 205 important factor (P = .003) in the selection of news sources from question 4, whereas age was 206 not (P = .19). Additionally, 69.9% of survey participants preferred using state or veterinary 207 resources to obtain information during an equine disease outbreak.208 Participant perception of the accuracy of sources for everyday news was negatively 209 associated with increasing age (P = .004). The type of information source (i.e. online, social, or 210 traditional) for everyday news was an important factor (P < .0001), with social media viewed as 211 less trustworthy than online and traditional information sources. Role did not influence (P = .75) 212 perceptions of accuracy for these everyday news sources. 213 Age and type of information source also affected how participants perceived the 214 availability of the information source for everyday news. A significant interaction between news 215 source and age (P < .0001) precipitated additional examination of the perceived availability of an 216 information source by either news source or age. Role was not an important factor for 217 availability ratings of an information source (P = .94). Figure 2 demonstrates significantly 218 different availability ratings for each of the three types of everyday news sources at three 219 indicated participant ages. However, for participants age 65 years and older, there was no 220 difference (P = .48) in availability ratings for online versus traditional types of everyday news used to inform the second study objective and further assess how the accuracy and availability of a source affects where individuals access information 226 during an equine disease outbreak. There was a statistically significant association between 227 where individuals first seek information in the event of an equine disease outbreak and accuracy 228 of their everyday news source. Specifically, as everyday news accuracy ratings for social media 229 sources increased, the odds of someone selecting a veterinary source over a social media source 230 during a disease outbreak decreased (Odds Ratio = .48, 95% CI [0.30, 0.77]). Furthermore, as the 231 accuracy of everyday news traditional sources increased, the odds of someone selecting a 232 traditional or for profit news source over a social media source during a disease outbreak 233 increased (Odds Ratio = 6.00, 95% CI [1.66, 21.71]). There was insufficient evidence to suggest 234 that accuracy of online sources impacted where individuals first accessed information (P = .21). 235 There was insufficient evidence to suggest that the availability of everyday news sources (social, 236 online, traditional) affected where individuals accessed information during a disease outbreak (P 237 = .45, .77, .25, respectively).",

More than 258 60% of horse owners consider their horses as family members [33] which can impact the 259 emotional aspect of information seeking behavior as individuals transition from the information 260 they need for their everyday lives to the information that they need to respond to an equine 261 disease outbreak. Understanding of how someone seeks information around a crisis event [16] is 262 therefore critical for animal health and Extension experts to best meet the information needs of 263 their public. This study was conducted to evaluate how accuracy and availability of information 264 affect Colorado equine industry members' choices for news sources in the event of an equine 265 disease outbreak. 266 The demographics of the survey respondents in this study were similar to what is known 267 of the equine industry in the US [5,33-35] with a predominantly female population engaging in 268 a variety of equine industry roles. Although the percentage of female survey participants in this 269 study is little higher than what has been reported by similar web-based surveys of the equine industry [28,33,35], this may be a reflection of the much smaller sample used in this study. however, this population was not included in this survey. Nonetheless, there was an equal 273 distribution of respondents to this survey that were either greater or less than 45 years of age 274 whereas other surveys have noted both higher [35] and lower [5] response rates from adult 275 individuals age 45+. The demographic data of the survey respondents was used to make several 276 interesting findings. 277 Firstly, age and industry role significantly affect where individuals gather everyday 278 information (Figure 1); however, we cannot determine how industry role is important given the 279 study design. The study design may also result in some overlap in news sources for everyday 280 news as many traditional news sources have an online presence and online news sources may be 281 accessed from a social media site. Nonetheless, the preference for younger survey participants to 282 seek everyday news from social media, regardless of whether they later use an online source, is 283 not surprising given the generational divide in social media use worldwide [36]. Additionally, 284 age and news source affect the ratings individuals give for accuracy and availability of everyday 285 sources. While social media sources were viewed as less trustworthy, older survey participants 286 found social media news sources to be significantly less available than traditional or online 287 sources (Figure 2). The study participant's role in the equine industry did not influence 288 perceptions of accuracy for everyday news. In the event of a disease outbreak, industry role was 289 a significant factor in selection of news sources, whereas age was not, with 69.9% of the 290 respondents preferring state or veterinary resources. Although perceptions of accuracy 291 significantly affect where individuals gather equine disease information, neither accuracy nor 292 availability affects the reason why individuals gather everyday information. Lastly, there is a significant association between where individuals decide to seek information first in the event of 294 an equine disease outbreak, and whether they consider the accuracy or availability of the 295 information source to be more important (Figure 3). 296 To some extent, participant age and perceptions of source accuracy and availability all 297 influence where and why individuals access disease information. In a similar study of the 298 information seeking preferences of beef producers in Oklahoma, their veterinarian was their 299 preferred source for animal health related issues or during a crisis, with a high degree of trust in 300 state, federal and local Extension resources [37]. These individuals also listed TV and the 301 Internet as secondary resources during a crisis event, and nearly half preferred receiving 302 information on an agriculturally related crisis via a county Extension publication [37]. Other 303 studies that have evaluated information-seeking preferences among members of the equine 304 industry have also demonstrated veterinarians to be a preferred source of information [20,23-305 25,27]. Of note, more than 90% of competitive riders in the US prefer obtaining horse health 306 information from their veterinarians, but more than 80% of these individuals still use the internet 307 to obtain this information [25]. Surveys of equine care-givers in the Midwest demonstrate that 308 77% of respondents seek information from their veterinarian, whereas only 7% will seek out an 309 Extension specialist, even though veterinarians and Extension specialists are among their most 310 trusted resources [24]. Interestingly, Extension specialists were not reported to be a source of 311 information during an equine disease outbreak in this study. Extension in Colorado is facilitated 312 by CSU; given the study design it is possible that Veterinary Extension resources in Colorado 313 were viewed by the survey participants as a CSU-related resource in the survey responses rather 314 than as Extension. However, at the time of this study it is also possible that members of the Colorado equine industry related CSU Extension with more general animal health information 316 needs and not necessarily information related to an equine disease outbreak. 317 Extension programs are designed [28,29] and evaluated [38] with exquisite care, and 318 while they have traditionally used mass media as a form of communication [39], their use of 319 online tools and social media as a dissemination strategy has increased in the last ten years [40-320 45]. Additionally, the eXtension Foundation has expanded the resources available to Extension 321 agents by providing a central point for collaboration. Topics in equine welfare or care are 322 primarily included in surveys reporting Extension program needs [20,29,46] or information-323 seeking behaviors of the equine industry [24,25,27]. While online learning tools such as 324 webinars [47] or websites with timely topics in equine care [48] have had a positive impact, they 325 have focused on animal care or emergency preparedness, not actual crisis event communication. 326 In response to the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Extension programs provided 327 specific recommendations for equine facilities to execute social distancing recommendations as 328 well as access to additional resources [49,50]. Future studies evaluating the information-seeking 329 behaviors of the Colorado equine industry may also demonstrate Extension to be a preferred 330 resource during a crisis event.",

            "text": "334 utilized a voluntary response sample with an online survey distributed via internet dependent 335 means such as email and social media. Nonetheless, our data suggest that people value the 336 accuracy of state and veterinary resources, but at the time that the survey was conducted the 337 industry did not perceive these resources to be available. The results of this study were shared in 2017 with the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) State Veterinarian's Office (SVO) 339 and qualitative information regarding CDA strategies for disseminating information was 340 obtained. The CDA Animal Health Division website 341 (https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/aganimals) has \"FAQ\" links to \"Current Disease Outbreaks in 342 the US\" and a direct link to the Equine Disease Communication Center 343 (http://www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts/outbreaks). The CDA-SVO also has a social media presence via the 344 Colorado Department of Agriculture Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/coloradoag/). This page 345 shares disease information through condensed news releases and short informational messages. 346 This state resource is designed to stop rumors, connect with the industry, and disseminate 347 accurate veterinary information, while also allowing the CDA to gather information about what 348 is going on in the industry. In relation to Colorado VSV cases, the CDA-SVO Facebook page 349 was initially used in 2014, but mainly to put out periodic news releases to give factual data on 350 VSV cases, including current updates on the CDA-SVO's response and resources for horse 351 owners. In 2015, the CDA-SVO enhanced their use of social media and their Facebook page 352 became a resource to a quell rumors and to provide real time answers to specific questions by the 353 public. In addition, the Facebook page directed individuals and veterinarians to call the CDA for 354 more information. In conjunction with the Facebook page, the CDA website was also used to 355 quell rumors that were discovered on Facebook, provide general scientific/factual information 356 about the disease, and give weekly updates on the incident and the animal health emergency 357 response that was being conducted. During the 2019 VSV outbreak was the first time the CDA-358 SVO used their Facebook page to communicate with the public regarding statistics and VSV 359 information, including dissemination of a dedicated webpage for Colorado VSV cases. In 360 addition to weekly updates via Facebook, changes in statutes allowed USDA accredited veterinarians to conduct VSV investigations and the CDA-VSO Facebook page was used to communicate guidelines for VSV sample submissions for said veterinarians. Conducted in 2016, are utilizing online strategies to also communicate during a human disease pandemic. As older 372 individuals begin to leave the equine industry, the impact of younger members will increase, 373 making the optimization of online resources a vital means of communication. Future studies 374 evaluating the Colorado equine industry's perception of this change in availability dissemination 375 of information using online state resources should also be designed to investigate barriers to 376 access, including physical lack of connectivity in rural areas or socioeconomic barriers impeding 377 equity of online access [40].",
