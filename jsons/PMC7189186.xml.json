Among those, it seems that the new pandemic is complicated by an older one, which is already well-defined, that is obesity. Being overweight and obesity are defined as having abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, respectively, that may impair health [2]. Obesity has nearly tripled worldwide since 1975, hence it has been characterised as a pandemic. In 2016, 39% of adults worldwide (more than 1.9 billion people) were overweight and 13% were obese (over 650 million people), whereas in 2018, 40 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese. Obesity is a major health concern, mainly because of its side-effects in humans and its associated morbidity and mortality rates [3].",

Earlier investigations of SARS-CoV infection, showed that it mediated its actions via suppression of NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity, resulting in lower Cox-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) expression (thus easing inflammation) [11]. In MERS-CoV infection, translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus leads to a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines [12]. Among all interleukins, IL-6 was found to be associated with a highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to enhanced virus replication mainly in the lower respiratory tract [13]. Moreover, levels of ferritin and IL-6 were statistically significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors in the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China [14].",

            "text": "Obesity represents a state of low-grade inflammation, with various inflammatory products directly secreted by adipose tissue. Hyperplastic or hypertrophied adipose tissue releases inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10), transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), adipokines (leptin, resistin, adiponectin), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5), hemostatic proteins (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAI-1), proteins affecting blood pressure, (angiotensinogen) and angiogenic molecules (vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF) [15]. The main adipose tissue-derived inflammatory cytokines are TNF\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, which altogether comprise an \u201cinflammatory triad\u201d. Levels of TNF\u03b1 are increased in obesity, indicating a role for this cytokine in the obesity-associated inflammation and particularly in insulin resistance and diabetes. Interleukin-1 can lead to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-kB, promoting inflammatory signalling overexpression of the angiogenic factor VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), while increased levels of IL-6 in obesity play a key role in inflammation-associated carcinogenesis, via the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling pathway [16]. Features of inflammation are consequent hypoxia and ischemia (hypoxia is the lack of oxygen in the blood or in adipose tissue, while ischemia is caused by an inadequate blood flow). Both hypoxia and ischemia drive to a state of oxidative stress, further stimulating the secretion of inflammatory proteins and reactive oxygen radicals (radical oxygen species, ROS) that damage mitochondrial functionality and DNA [17]. Thus, the hypertrophic, and at the same time hypoxic, white adipocytes change their normal protein synthesis and shift towards the production of cytokines and inflammatory proteins, leading to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis and arterial hypertension, while recent evidence favours their implication in various types of cancer [18].",

Leptin is a cytokine that serves as an alarm (inhibition signal) to the body, in order to reduce caloric consumption and return to a steady state. Initially thought as the cure for obesity in a recombinant form, leptin was found to face serious resistance in the body of the obese. Although in obesity leptin levels are increased, the action of leptin per se is reduced, in a analogous way to insulin\u2019s action in patients with T2DM. Zhang et al. suggested that leptin resistance could aggravate the outcome of the patients during the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic influenza, since leptin exerts positive effects in B cell maturation, development and function, along with alterations of lymphocytes and inhibition of CD8+ T cell response and impaired memory T cell response, seen in obesity, which both under normal circumstances would act against the virus [19].",

Angiotensin (AT) II promotes prostacyclin synthesis, differentiation of the adipocytes and lipogenesis. Inside the adipose cell, ACE is stimulated towards the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus further stimulating the RAAS axis, the production of aldosterone and the rise in blood pressure [20]. Various reports have included arterial hypertension as a risk factor for severity of SARS-CoV-2, possibly related to ACE2 via the actions of ACE-inhibitors and AT receptor blockers (ARB), given for the treatment of hypertension (ACE2 acts as receptor that indeed seems to facilitate the entry of coronavirus into cells) [21]. Of note, the percentage of patients with hypertension suffering from SARS-CoV-2 is roughly the same as the prevalence of hypertension in the same age group, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which means that hypetension is not a risk factor per se, but rather a pre-existing disease at that age group [21]. Overall data do not fully support the notion that discontinuation of these medications is beneficial, since other reports in animals show that elevated ACE2 expression might exert potentially protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects [21] (Fig. 1\n).",

In obesity, resistance to leptin (along with resistin) leads to insulin resistance (both in the brain and in peripheral tissues) and eventually to hyperglycemia and T2DM. Moreover, adipose tissue releases ATG, which, via ACE is converted to AT II and increases blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to cells via ACE2 and may provoke hyperglycemia (see text for more details); FFA: free fatty acids, ATG: angiotensinogen, ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme, AT II: angiotensin II, AT 1\u20137: angiotensin 1-7 (vasodilatory), NO: Nitric Oxide, T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus, ACE2: angiotensin converting enzyme 2, \u2217: is usually upregulated in subjects with hypertension on ACE-inhibitors and AT receptor blockers (ARB), \u2217\u2217hyperglycemia has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection \u2013 the specific mechanisms have not been elucidated.",
