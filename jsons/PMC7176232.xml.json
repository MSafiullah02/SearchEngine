An estimated 10 million infections occur in pregnant women annually, resulting in 500,000 cases of severe maternal anemia and 500,000 low birth weight babies (Greenwood et al. 2005). In malaria-endemic countries of Africa, up to 40% of all outpatient clinic visits and between 20 and 50% of all hospital admissions are due to malaria (WHO 2003). Although the incidence of uncomplicated malaria is lower in adolescents aged 10\u201319 years than younger school aged and preschool children, the burden of malaria in this age group could be substantial in areas with high and stable transmission. A recent review of the epidemiology and pattern of malaria in adolescents estimates the clinical malaria rate in African adolescents aged 10\u201320 years to be 0.252 attacks per adolescent per year (Lalloo et al. 2006). Results of analyses based on rainfall and temperature data and geographic information system (GIS) population databases in areas with high and stable malaria transmission put the yearly estimate of the number of malaria attacks in children aged 0\u20134 years, 5\u20139 years, and 10\u201314 years at 81.3 million, 16.0 million, and 13.4 million, respectively.",

In areas with high and stable malaria transmission, resident adults and older children acquire sufficient partial immunity to reduce the risk of severe and fatal malaria but younger children and pregnant women remain vulnerable to severe and complicated malaria. Malaria infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The majority of malaria infections in areas where transmission is high and stable are asymptomatic. Even when malaria infection is asymptomatic, it is believed that the high prevalence of low parasitemic and asymptomatic malaria infections contribute to the high prevalence of mild and moderate childhood anemia. In these settings, young children who are less immune to the disease are more likely to have clinical malaria following infections.",

Uncomplicated malaria is the most common reason for which children and adults use the health service in sub-Saharan Africa. Uncomplicated malaria accounts for about 40 and 30% of outpatient attendance and hospital admissions, respectively. Malaria is also a leading cause of absenteeism and poor performance at work and school. Uncomplicated malaria is rarely fatal when treated promptly with effective antimalarial drugs. In preschool children, delayed treatment or failure to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria could lead to rapid disease progression to severe and potentially fatal malaria within a period often less than 48 h from onset of illness. Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria through complex processes that involve immunological substances known as cytokines (John et al. 2000) leading to impaired perfusion and damage to tissues and organs. These pathological changes lead to clinical and laboratory features that are characteristic of severe and complicated malaria, namely cerebral malaria that is associated with impaired consciousness, repeated convulsions, severe malarial anemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and circulatory collapse. Children that die from malaria would have one or more of these signs. The risk of death is higher in patients with multiple signs (Schellenberg et al. 1999). Case fatality rate of complicated falciparum malaria is 10\u201350%. About 10\u201317% of those that survive cerebral malaria have residual neurological problems such as dyskinesia, cortical blindness, seizures, and learning disorders (Meremikwu et al.1997). Most of these disorders are resolved within 6 months but about 2% persist for longer periods of time causing varying degrees of disability and impaired intellectual development (Murphy and Breman 2001).",

In areas with high transmission, malaria is the leading etiological factor for anemia. The processes by which malaria causes anemia are not yet fully understood; however, malaria-related toxins and immunological factors are believed to cause increased hemolysis, increased splenic clearance of infected and uninfected red blood cells, and impaired production of red blood cells in the bone marrow (dyserythropoeisis). In areas of Africa with high malaria transmission, surveys have shown high prevalence rates of anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) among infants and children under 5 years of age (as high as 50\u201380% in several areas). Most of these cases of anemia go unnoticed and untreated because they are mild and cause no symptoms. Although children with mild and chronic anemia do not feel distinct symptoms of illness, mild anemia is associated with chronic debility. It can cause such adverse effects as reduced activity and impaired cognition and learning. These chronic effects of malarial anemia in concert with malaria-related school absenteeism and neurological complications from cerebral malaria, adversely affect childhood development and education in sub-Saharan Africa (Mung\u2019Ala-Odera et al. 2004).",

It is responsible for high case fatality and often follows massive hemolysis from a single episode of falciparum malaria. Repeated episodes or poorly treated episodes of uncomplicated malaria are fairly common pathways to severe anemia in infants and young children who are residents of areas with high and stable malaria transmission. In many communities in Africa where there are high levels of P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine and sulphadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine, the continued use of failed drugs has resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe malarial anemia. Case fatality from severe malarial anemia varies from 1% in treated cases to over 30% when associated with other complications of falciparum malaria, especially respiratory distress and deep coma (John et al. 2000). Many more children with life-threatening severe malaria anemia do not have access to formal health care where adequate treatment and blood transfusion are possible. This indicates that overall case fatality from severe malarial anemia is likely to be much higher than reported. Blood transfusion for severe malaria-related anemia accounts for a remarkable proportion of new pediatric HIV infections in Africa (Crawley and Nahlen 2004).",

For instance, mass de-worming of children and micronutrient supplementation programs are interventions that have the potential to reduce the burden of childhood anemia in developing countries (Briand et al. 2007). Insecticide-treated nets, chemoprophylaxis, and intermittent preventive treatment are malaria-specific interventions that have been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from malaria-related anemia (Briand et al. 2007). Malaria is a leading cause of hemolytic and vaso-occlusive crisis in African children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited hematological disease among Africans. The prevalence of the sickle cell trait (heterozygous inheritance on an abnormal and a normal gene) can be as high as 25\u201340% in some parts of Africa with 1\u20133% affected by the disorder (inheritance of a pair of abnormal gene). A paradoxical relationship exists between the sickle cell gene and malaria. The sickle gene is believed to confer some measure of protection against malaria to those with the trait (one abnormal gene); however, it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among those with the disorder (two abnormal genes).",

Hyperactive malarial splenomegaly (also called tropical splenomegaly syndrome) is another chronic, but less common presentation of malaria among children and adolescents in the tropics.

The effect of malaria in pregnancy is influenced by the level of malaria immunity acquired by the mother before pregnancy. This depends on the pattern and intensity of malaria transmission. The parasite species, the number of previous pregnancies, and the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also remarkably impact malaria morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. In areas with high and stable malaria transmission, the prevalence and intensity of P. falciparum parasitemia are higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. The majority of malaria infections in pregnant women living in high transmission areas are asymptomatic because of immunity acquired from repeated exposure to malaria before pregnancy. The adverse consequences of malaria during pregnancy in areas of high transmission are anemia, placental malaria, intrauterine growth retardation, and low birth weight. In areas of low or unstable transmission, acquired malaria immunity is low in all age groups. Pregnant women with malaria in this area are vulnerable to severe manifestation of the disease including cerebral malaria.\n\n",

Impact of the complex interaction between malaria and HIV appears to be most profound in pregnancy and children. HIV infection in pregnancy is known to increase the risk of malaria infection (population attributable risk (PAR), 10\u201327%), maternal anemia (PAR, 12\u201315%), and low birth weight (PAR, 11\u201338%) (Steketee et al. 2001). The mechanism by which HIV infection alters malaria morbidity is not well understood. It is believed to be due to systemic and placental immunologic changes that are induced by HIV. In a Rwandan cohort study that included 228 HIV-positive and 229 HIV-negative participants, the incidence of malaria was almost twice as high in the HIV-positive group (6.2 per 100 women-months) than in the HIV- negative group (3.5 per 100 women-months) (Ladner et al. 2002). A review of studies on malaria and HIV co-infection shows that HIV infection in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of peripheral and placental malaria parasitemia. Malaria in pregnant women infected by HIV is more likely to cause higher parasite densities, febrile illness, severe anemia, and low birth weight than malaria in those without HIV infection (Snow et al. 2003). In the absence of HIV infection, the deleterious effects of malaria in pregnancy, notably low birth weight and maternal anemia, were significantly worse in those pregnant for the first or second time than in those who have been pregnant for three or more times (Ter Kuile et al. 2004). With HIV co-infection, the pattern of malaria morbidity is similar across all categories of pregnant women (Ter Kuile et al. 2004).",

Achieving high coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) use and prompt access to treatment with artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs) would contribute to the reduction in the morbidity and mortality attributable to HIV co-infection with malaria in high transmission areas. In areas of low intensity and unstable transmission, widespread and effective indoor residual spraying combined with effective treatment using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is cost-effective and has been shown to significantly reduce malaria morbidity and mortality (Snow et al. 2003).",

Population coverage for ITN in most parts of Africa remains low (<20%). The low re-treatment rate at the expiration of the usual period of potency (6 months) was a major challenge, even in areas that achieved high ITN coverage. The development and widespread deployment of factory-treated nets with lifelong protective effects (LLINs) has eliminated the need to re-treat insecticide-treated nets. The persisting challenge is how to improve access to ITNs by poor women and children who need to be protected from severe and fatal malaria. The Global Fund for Tuberculosis AIDS and Malaria is providing funding to countries in endemic low and middle-income countries to support this intervention. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials conducted in Africa showed that ITNs used in pregnancy compared to \u201cno nets\u201d significantly reduced the risk of placental malaria in all pregnancies (relative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63\u20130.98). The review also showed that ITNs significantly reduced the risk of low birth weight (relative risk 0.77, 95% CI 0.61\u20130.98) and fetal loss in the first to fourth pregnancy (relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.47\u20130.97). However, this was not the case in women with more than four previous pregnancies (Gamble et al. 2006). In a large randomized controlled trial in communities with intense and perennial malaria transmission, ITN use significantly reduced the risk of severe malaria anemia, placental malaria, and low birth weight among those pregnant for the first to fourth time, but not in those pregnant for five or more times (Ter Kuile et al. 2003). The adherence to ITN use in pregnancy was shown to be significantly lower in adolescent and young women, who are most at risk for the deleterious consequences of malaria (Browne et al. 2001). This observation and the known risk of higher malaria morbidity associated with first pregnancy (involving mostly adolescent women) make it necessary to specially target this age group for intervention.",

The emergence of these multidrug-resistant malaria parasites led to the adoption of combination treatment options as the gold standards for treating malaria. The WHO (2006) recommends that the ideal drug combination should contain two drugs that are individually effective against the blood stages of the parasite and use completely different mechanisms to kill the parasite. Based on results from several well-conducted studies, the WHO recommended that combinations that contain artemisinin (a drug derived from the Chinese plant A. annua L.) or its derivatives and another structurally unrelated and more slowly acting drug provide the best therapeutic effects and are safe. This category of drug combinations is collectively known as artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs).",

Replacing the older failing or failed monotherapies with effective drugs will reduce morbidity and mortality. The challenge, however, remains how to deliver these drugs to the people that need them. Implementation of this policy would put significant cost burdens on national malaria control programs.

ACTs are generally too expensive for most people in low-income settings where malaria is endemic.

International efforts to address this issue championed by the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partnership have yielded some positive results, especially through the Global Fund for Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria (Brundtland 2002). However, huge gaps still exist. Unfortunately access to prompt treatment with effective antimalarial drugs remains very low in many sub-Saharan countries, leading to the persistence of high malaria mortality rates. The reasons for poor access to treatment are mainly due to weak health systems that are poorly patronized by the populace and a lack of funds to procure and effectively deliver expensive artemisinin-based combination treatment (ACTs). ACTs are necessary since high levels of P. falciparum resistance have rendered chloroquine and sulphadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine ineffective. These were the cheaper treatment options that have been used for several decades. Most children who become ill with malaria in these areas are usually treated at home with poor quality or inappropriately administered medicines that were purchased from local, often untrained drug vendors.",

However, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa fell far short of these targets. It was also in the same year that RBM set the landmark target of halving malaria mortality by 2010. Appraisal of malaria control efforts at the end of 2005 uniformly indicated that resources available for procurement of malaria control commodities (ACTs, ITN, and diagnostic kits) were grossly inadequate. The appraisal also showed that malaria control personnel at national and regional levels was inadequately equipped.",

Key: (A) Mosquito infected with the malaria parasite bites human, passing cells called sporozoites into the human\u2019s bloodstream. (B) Sporozoites travel to the liver. Each sporozoite undergoes asexual reproduction, in which its nucleus splits to form two new cells called merozoites. (C) Merozoites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. (D) In red blood cells, merozoites grow and divide to produce more merozoites, eventually causing the red blood cells to rupture. Some of the newly released merozoites go on to infect other red blood cells. (E) Some merozoites develop into sex cells known as male and female gametocytes. (F) Another mosquito bites the infected human, ingesting the gametocytes. (G) In the mosquito\u2019s stomach, the gametocytes mature. Male and female gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, uniting to form a zygote. The zygote multiplies to form sporozoites, which travel to the mosquito\u2019s salivary glands. (H) If this mosquito bites another human, the cycle begins again. Source: Microsoft Encarta (2008), http://encarta.msn.com/media_461541582_761566151_-1_1/life_cycle_of_the_malaria_parasite.html\n",
