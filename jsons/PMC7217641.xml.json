Understanding the effect of COVID-19 on mortality during this emergency requires modelling of an infectious disease, as well as wider medical and societal changes. One way of estimating and monitoring excess mortality is to compare observed numbers of deaths with those expected based on the background (pre-COVID-19) mortality risks in the population.1\n",

This situation is changing, with severe infections being treated in younger patients with COVID-19 who do not have underlying conditions.8 Case fatality rates for COVID-19 vary from 0\u00b727% to 10%,9 possibly explained by differing demography, testing strategies, and prevalence of underlying conditions. The UK has relatively high case fatality rates (8\u00b72%), but mortality rates are unknown at this stage of the pandemic because testing is more common among sicker patients who are admitted to hospital (the context where most testing has been done) rather than milder cases. On April 14, the Office for National Statistics reported 6000 excess deaths registered in the week March 28 to April 3, 2020, of which about 2500 deaths did not have COVID-19 recorded on the death certificates, providing the first indication of indirect effects of the pandemic on mortality.10\n",

We found no previous studies of excess deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous tools and models to estimate COVID-19-related deaths have not considered the prevalence of underlying conditions, background pre-COVID-19 mortality, long-term estimates, or the relative impact (relative risk) of COVID-19 on mortality. Without these data, it is challenging to predict and prepare health systems to respond to the COVID-19 health-care burden.\nAdded value of this study\nWe produced a model to estimate the excess COVID-19-related mortality by incorporating population infection rate in different scenarios relating to degree of social isolation, differing degrees of impact of COVID-19 on health systems, and prevalence of underlying conditions. We showed that in a full suppression scenario, even if COVID-19 has high relative impact on health systems, excess mortality over 1 year can be minimised. Conversely, with mitigation (ie, less rigorous and voluntary measures), we predict between 18 000 and 37 000 deaths. We have provided a prototype risk calculator for the researchers and policy makers to make estimates and change the assumptions in the model. We also highlight the value of routine electronic health records and use of large, linked datasets at the country level in responding to the pandemic.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur models allow the estimation of overall (direct and indirect) effects on excess mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time, we provide a model, a tool, and open-access data to individualise risk prediction across underlying conditions, which has clinical, public health, and research benefits for both the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic contexts.\n",

Follow-up ceased at the date of death or on Jan 1, 2017. We estimated prevalence of each underlying condition and used Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-year all-cause mortality at each age group cell to estimate the number of excess deaths by age bands and at each number of conditions cell to estimate by number of underlying conditions. We then modelled the excess COVID-19-associated mortality for relative impact of mortality associated with COVID-19 (relative risk [RR] compared with background mortality) of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, and 3\u00b7021 at the infection rate consequences of different strategies: full suppression (0\u00b7001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), or do nothing (80%).22 Relative risk is a comparison of risks or probabilities. For example, an RR of 2\u00b70 for COVID-19 describes a doubling of the risk of mortality in individuals infected with or affected by COVID-19 versus their background risk of death. A definition of COVID-19-related mortality relevant to the emergency includes both deaths among those infected (direct), and deaths among those affected by health service, societal, and economic changes (indirect). Considering excess deaths in this way, it is reasonable to consider that a high proportion (eg, 80% of the population) might be affected by the COVID-19 emergency. To extrapolate our estimates of excess deaths to the whole population of England older than 30 years, we used 2018 estimates of overall population size and mortality.23 For illustration, we applied our study estimates to UN Population Fund24 estimates of population size in other countries. All analyses were done using R, version 3.4.3. Data were analysed in the University College London ISO27001 safe haven.",

Thus, at high infection rates, relative risks for excess mortality would almost certainly be much higher\u2014and these non-linear interactions are a subject for further modelling. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to be much greater if there is poor compliance with social isolation policies and low treatment and health-system capacity. The RR of COVID-19 infection and the case fatality rate have been estimated,21 but the RR for mortality will better capture the impact of infection on individuals and health systems. Even in the RR of 2\u00b70 model, full suppression would lead to virtually no excess mortality, because some patients with underlying conditions would have died over a 1-year period regardless of the COVID-19 outbreak. The prototype online risk calculator allows exploration and visualisation of the age-specific, sex-specific, and underlying condition-specific excess mortality under different assumptions. Near real-time cause-specific mortality, as reported by the Office for National Statistics, ideally on a weekly basis, will greatly aid understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.10 Such information can inform timing of exit strategies from lockdown. In future analyses, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disease-specific health-care provision and use should be assessed.",
