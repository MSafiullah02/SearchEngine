RVAs known to infect young humans and animals have been classified into 27 G and 35 P types on the basis of VP7 (G, glycoprotein) and VP4 (P, protease sensitive) proteins, respectively [5]. RVBs are genetically and antigenically distinct from RVAs and have been found to infect humans and different species of animals.

Although occurrence of outbreaks of gastroenteritis has been documented in the records of the State Surveillance Unit, Integrated Disease Surveillance Project, Maharashtra, investigations to unfold viral aetiology have been rarely carried out. In the present study, two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis that occurred in southern Mumbai, western India in the months of March and October 2006 were investigated for multiple enteric viral agents to determine their contribution in causing gastroenteritis.",

Thus, sewage water is a good source of a variety of enteric viruses circulating in any region/community [40]. An accidental mixing of the sewage water with the drinking water supply provides an opportunity to multiple enteric viruses to infect humans simultaneously and cause disease outbreaks. In the present study, water samples tested negative for enteric viruses. However, contamination of drinking water was reflected by brown color and malodor noticed by the inhabitants prior to the occurrence of outbreak, thus indicating leakages in the pipelines. The information available from the affected localities indicated that the water supplying pipes were more than 100 years old and that unauthorized and unclaimed pipelines existed for water connection. Since the daily water supply in this area was intermittent, back siphoning of sewage water in the drinking water supplying pipes could not be ruled out. Subsequently, clusters of cases who developed diarrhea and/or vomiting were reported from a single locality in a short period representing rampant infections of gastroenteritis [43,44]. These findings highlight the possible enhancing impact of the sewage contamination on the endemic transmission of prevalent and emerging strains of enteric viruses. Notably, majority of the viral agents (RVA, NoV, AdV, HAstV and EV) detected in the patients affected by outbreaks showed the presence of more than one genotype/serotype indicating diverse nature of enteric viral pathogens. Thus, this report provides strong evidence of the cocirculation of multiple enteric viruses in Mumbai, the biggest cosmopolitan city of India. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from India that documents coexistence of seven (RVA, RVB, NoV, AdV, HAstV, EV and AiV) important enteric viruses in the outbreak cases of acute gastroenteritis and emphasizes the need to investigate such outbreak cases in different parts of India to evaluate the health risk associated with enteric viral pathogens in Indian population.",

            "text": "This investigation reports association of seven different enteric viruses in two outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Mumbai, India, one of the most densely populated cities in the World. Virological examination of the faecal specimens from the outbreaks ascertained the predominance of RVAs and EVs in the study population. Therefore, intervention strategies need to be developed against these viral infections. Occurrence of two outbreaks within seven months period in the same region emphasizes the need for constant vigilance of water supply and drainage systems to reduce the risks of such incidences. Overall, the study ratifies the need for continuous surveillance of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Mumbai and also in other parts of India for identifying the prevalent and new enteric viruses.",
