The latter include, but are not limited to, glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans. Unlike proteins, which are composed of amino acids that are connected solely by one possible peptide bond, carbohydrates utilize many possible glycosidic linkages so as to extensively diversify their structures. For example, two amino acid residues, such as two alanines, can produce only one possible dipeptide; however, two molecules of glucose have the potential to generate 11 different disaccharides. A trimer of any of the nine common sugar residues of the human body theoretically can give rise to 119,736 different structural isomers; this is in striking contrast to the maximal construction of 8,000 tripeptides using 20 different amino acid residues. Theoretically, sugar chain structures can have unlimited variation.",

In plants, a highly complex set of polysaccharides are associated with structural proteins and lignin to form cell walls (Avci et al. 2012). Even in a given tissue or cell, cell wall layers and domains may have very different carbohydrate structures and express different glyco-epitopes (Albersheim et al. 2010; Avci et al. 2012). Many microbial organisms also carry unique glycosylation systems and produce specific sugar signatures for almost every microorganism in the living world (Dochez and Avery 1917; Heidelberger and Avery 1923; Ezzell et al. 1990; Robbins and Schneerson 1990; Mond et al. 1995; Wang and Kabat 1996).

            "text": "Importantly, multiple carbohydrate recognition systems are present in living species. For example, there are numerous anti-glycan antibodies produced by human and other animal species that play key roles in protecting a host from microbial infections (Behring and Kitasato 1890; Wang and Kabat 1998; Lucas et al. 2008) and families of lectin-like glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that are evolved for carbohydrate-mediated cell-cell communication (Drickamer 1988; Sharon 2007; Varki 2009). The well-known GBPs that are associated with cell signaling and immunomodulation are the receptors of the innate immune system, such as Dectin-1 that recognizes fungal \u03b2-glucans (Brown et al. 2002), mannose receptor that recognizes carbohydrate moieties on multiple pathogens and is involved in the clearance of inflammatory molecules in vivo (Gruden-Movsesijan and Milosavljevic Lj 2006), and DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin) that selectively detects viral glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein (Curtis et al. 1992). The interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and DC-SIGN plays an important role in the CD4-independent association of HIV with human cells (Curtis et al. 1992). Thus, carbohydrates are suitable for storing biological signals in forms that are identifiable by other biological systems.",

            "text": "However, availability of carbohydrate structural information alone is not sufficient in defining a glyco-epitope unless its specific binding by an antibody or a GBP is also demonstrated immunochemically and/or cryptographically. For example, chemical determination of a tetrasaccharide that decorates the spore of Bacillus anthracis appears to be an important discovery in microbial glycomics (Daubenspeck et al. 2004). Based on past knowledge of immunogenic carbohydrate moieties, this structural glycomics progress may suggest that this unique sugar moiety may have potential in an immunological application (Saksena et al. 2005, 2007). However, whether such a carbohydrate moiety preserves a B cell epitope or a potent antigenic determinant must be determined immunologically, including at least demonstration of its antibody-binding specificity and capacity in eliciting immune responses in vivo (Wang et al. 2007). It was the integrated structural and immunological investigation of glyco-epitopes (Wang et al. 2007; Lucas et al. 2008) that has revealed anthrose tetrasaccharides as key immunological targets of B. anthracis.",

This technical feature ensures a condition in which the binding of a molecule in solution phase to an immobilized microspot of ligand on the microarray substrate has minimal reduction of the molar concentration of the molecule in solution (Ekins et al. 1990). Thus, microarray-based assays are intrinsically optimized for binding equilibrium to take place, which is the basis for this class of hypersensitive binding assays (Stoll et al. 2002). Carbohydrate microarrays have higher detection sensitivity than most conventional carbohydrate analytical tools, such as carbohydrate-specific ELISA and the glycolipid-based \u201cEastern blot\u201d assays that were developed in the 1980s by a number of early researchers in this field (Wood and Kabat 1981; Tang et al. 1985). Historically, this situation is very similar to the relationship between conventional blotting methods for nucleic acids or proteins, such as Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and nucleic acid\u2013based or protein/peptide\u2013based microarrays.",

            "text": "Carbohydrate microarrays constructed by various methods may differ in their technical characteristics and suitability for a given practical application. Some platforms may be applied complementarily to solve a practical question. For example, the method of nitrocellulose-based immobilization of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules, including polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, is suitable for the high-throughput construction of carbohydrate antigen microarrays (Wang et al. 2002, 2005; Wang and Lu 2004) to support the large-scale immunological characterization of carbohydrate antigens and anti-carbohydrate antibodies. However, the detection specificity of this carbohydrate microarray would be at the level of a carbohydrate antigen, not a glyco-epitope, if the native carbohydrate antigens were spotted. This is owing to the fact that many carbohydrate antigens display multiple antigenic determinants or glyco-epitopes (Cisar et al. 1975; Wang and Kabat 1998; Wang 2004). Examining the finer details of the binding properties would require the use of microarrays of defined oligosaccharide sequences. Oligosaccharide array-based binding assays can be applied, in combination with saccharide competition assays, to decipher precise saccharide components of a specific antigenic determinant or glyco-epitope (Fukui et al. 2002; Blixt et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2009). These technical features of carbohydrate microarrays are further discussed in two models, i.e., a carbohydrate antigen microarray platform and a technology of photogenerated oligosaccharide microarrays in subsequent sections.",

The former were produced via a single lipid preparation, e.g., phosphatidylcholine (PTC), cerebroside, and sulfatide. The latter contained two different lipid molecules with PTC as the support to display other lipid/glycolipids in desired ratios or epitope densities. For example, the hetero-liposome of sulfatide is composed of sulfatide and PTC at a ratio of 1:10 (wt/wt), i.e., 0.2 mg sulfatide and 2.0 mg PTC per ml of liposome suspension in saline.

For example, microarray scanning of autoantibody responses allows one to \u201cfish out\u201d potential autoantigens in the glycome in autoimmune diseases. Customized, smaller scale carbohydrate microarrays containing a few dozen antigens are, however, suitable for more defined purposes, such as antibody fine-specificity mapping, differential diagnosis among a number of known infectious diseases, measurement of autoantibodies for known targets in autoimmune diseases, etc. Fig. 2 shows a sub-array design where each chemically modified microglass slide contains eight separated sub-arrays. The microarray capacity is ~400 microspots per sub-array. A single slide is, thus, designed to enable eight microarray assays. Similar sub-array designs with various array capacities are commercially available (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH; ArrayIt, Sunnyvale, CA).Each microglass slide contains twelve sub-arrays of identical content. There is a chip space for about 400 microspots per sub-array, with spot sizes of approximately 200 \u03bcm and at 300-\u03bcm intervals, center to center. A single slide is, therefore, designed to enable 12 detections. This design is typically for printing four 96-well plates of antigen preparations (96 \u00d7 4 = 384).Repeats and dilutions: Our team usually prints carbohydrate antigens at the initial concentration of 0.1\u20130.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl. The absolute amount of antigens printed on the chip substrate is in the range of 0.1\u20130.25 ng per microspot for the highest concentration. They are further diluted at 1:3, 1:9, and 1:27, or as specified in each experiment. A given concentration of each preparation is repeated at least three times to allow statistical analysis of detection of identical preparations at given antigen concentrations.Positive controls and standard curves: Fluorescent conjugates, such as BSA conjugates of FITC, Cy5, Cy3, or other dyes, are routinely applied for microarray printing to provide positive markers for each fluorescent channel. These markers are helpful for scanning calibration, alignment of microarray spots during data-capturing, the subsequent microarray data normalization, and cross-chip scaling of microarray detection. For serological studies, antibodies of IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes of corresponding species are spotted to produce standard curves in microarray format. These curves serve as reference standards for quantifying antibody signals of a specific IgH chain isotype that are captured by spotted carbohydrate antigens.\n\n",

In considering the repertoires of the \u201chybrid\u201d structures that are generated by protein posttranslational modification, including both N- and O-glycosylation, the repertoires of carbohydrate-related antigenic structures can be much larger. Furthermore, the conformational diversity of carbohydrates and microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains substantially increases the repertoire of carbohydrate-based antigenic determinants or glyco-epitopes (Wang and Kabat 1996; Wang 2014).
