Robust evidence suggests that women in academic medicine shoulder more of the burden of domestic labor within their households than do men. One study of an elite sample of NIHfunded physician-researchers showed that women spent 8.5 hours more per week on parenting and domestic tasks than their men peers (Jolly et al., 2014) . Recent research also suggests that women in academia take on more domestic responsibilities than men, even in dual-career academic couples (Derrick et al., 2019) . Therefore, the recent restrictions in access to childcare might reasonably be expected to have disproportionate impact on women in academic medicine, as compared to men. The impact of new professional service demands that now compete with time for scholarly productivity in academic medicine, including restructuring of teaching and clinical care using virtual platforms, may also disproportionately impact women medical researchers, who are disproportionately represented on clinician-educator tracks .",

The medical literature now includes a substantial number of articles directly relating to COVID-19, mostly generated rapidly after the broader social restrictions came into being, in most US states, in March 2020. Therefore, we report the results of a global analysis of possible variations in women's proportion of authorships of articles on 050) , as compared to the proportion of women among authorships of all articles published in the same journals the previous year (N = 193,098) . Specifically, we used mixed logit and tobit models with scientific journal as random effect parameter, to estimate women's share of first authorships (logit), last authorships (logit) and proportional representation per article (tobit), for Covid-19 papers (treatment) and papers published in the same journals in 2019 (control). To obtain a closer approximation of differences across research areas, we calculated the proportion of women authorships per journal specialty. As shown in Table 1 , women are represented at lower rates across most specialty groupings in the COVID-19 sample as compared to the 2019 sample. The relative gap in women's participation is most salient in infectious diseases, radiology, pathology, and public health.",

Our analysis suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may be amplifying this gender gap in the medical literature. Specifically, we find that women constitute a lower proportion of authors of articles on COVID-19, as compared to the proportion of women among authors of all articles published in the same journals the previous year. The difference in women's participation before and after the pandemic is most striking for first authorships. This finding is consistent with the idea that restricted access to child-care and increased work-related service demands might take the greatest toll on early-career women, although our observational data cannot conclusively support causal claims. As more robust evidence becomes available, mechanisms which disadvantage specific ethnic, age and gender groups should be monitored and inform policies that promote equity (Donald, 2020) .",

Studies have demonstrated differences in the very language used by men and women to describe their research findings (Lerchenmueller et al., 2019) , and evidence suggests that women's writing may be held to higher standards (Hengel, 2017) . In any case, the current study suggest that if authorship of COVID-19-related papers is a bellwether, women's participation in the medical research literature may now be facing even greater challenges than before the pandemic, especially if ongoing or repeated episodes of social distancing are required as expected (Kissler et al., 2020) .",

However, descriptive analysis that breaks down our results by specialty does not suggest that those specialties that might dominate research related to COVID had low proportions of women among authors in 2019. Indeed, many such specialties, including infectious disease and public health, qualitatively appear to have a markedly lower proportion of women among authors in the 2020 COVID-related dataset than in the 2019 dataset within those fields. Therefore, despite limitations, this early look suggests that the previously documented gender gap in academic medical publishing may warrant renewed attention (Jagsi et al., 2006) and that ongoing research on this subject is necessary as more data become available.",

Only papers with gender reliably identified for first and last authors were included. Limiting the sample further to papers with at least one author with a US address, with gender determined for authors, gives us a treatment group of 1,179 papers (13.0%) and a control group of 37,531 papers (19.4%). The treatment group is relatively smaller, because proportionally more COVID-19 research has been done by researchers outside the US, especially those in China and Italy.",

This descriptive analysis suggests that the proportion of women publishing as first authors and last authors has decreased by 23% and 12%, respectively, after the outbreak of the Pandemic (COVID-19 sample: first authorships, arithmetic mean= 0.28; last authorships, arithmetic mean: 0.23; 2019 sample: first authorships, arithmetic mean= 0.36; last authorships, arithmetic mean: 0.26), while the overall share of women per author group has decreased by 11% (COVID-19 sample: arithmetic mean= 0.30; 2019 sample: arithmetic mean= 0.34). The crosses and error-bars in figure 1 (panels a and b) plot the adjusted means derived from the mixed logit models that control for variations in COVID-19 related research activities across scientific journals and show that women's estimated share of first authorships and last authorships is 23% and 16% lower in the COVID-19 sample (first authorships, adjusted mean= 0.28, CI: 0.25-0.31; last authorships, adjusted mean: 0.22, CI: 0.20-0.25) compared to the 2019 sample (first authorships, adjusted mean: 0.37, CI: 0.35-0.38; last authorships, adjusted mean: 0.27, CI: 0.25-0.28). Likewise, the outcomes of the mixed tobit model, plotted in panel c (figure 1), indicate that women's estimated general representation per article is 16% lower in the COVID-19 sample (adjusted mean: 0.30, CI: 0.27-0.32) compared to the 2019 sample (adjusted mean: 0.35, CI: 0.34-0.37) (see Figure 1-source data 1 to 3 for model specifications).",
