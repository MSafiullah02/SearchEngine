Therefore, enhancing the management of hospitalized patients is important for preventing and minimizing the further spread of COVID\u201019 during this epidemic. Real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay has been widely used to detect SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n2\n The Chinese government has also considered RT\u2010PCR result as an indicator of isolation, discharge, or transferring for patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019.\n3\n Notably, the isolation for patients can be revoked, and the patients will be discharged after two consecutive negative RT\u2010PCR tests.\n3\n However, it was reported on February 12, 2020 that five infected patients had initial negative or weakly positive RT\u2010PCR results.\n4\n In another reported case, the third time RT\u2010PCR test result for pharyngeal swab specimen from an infected patient turned to be positive after two previous negative results of the PCR test.\n5\n Here, we investigated 610 patients in one hospital clinically diagnosed with COVID\u201019 according to the chest computed tomography (CT) image during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and described the stability issues of RT\u2010PCR testing of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 for them.",

Patients with COVID\u201019 were defined as critically illed when meeting one of the following criteria: (a) respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation are required, (b) shock, (c) combined with other organ failure and need to transfer to the intensive care unit. RT\u2010PCR test of pharyngeal swab specimen was performed in all patients before admission. For patients with an initial negative, dubious positive or weakly positive RT\u2010PCR result, their pharyngeal swab specimens would be retest after 1 or 2 days. For patients with an initial positive RT\u2010PCR result, their pharyngeal swab specimens would be retest after the patients\u2019 clinical symptoms improved. Both the RT\u2010PCR results and the test dates were recorded and analyzed. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Hankou Hospital.

In the first test for all patients, 168 cases were positive (27.5%), one was weakly positive (0.2%), 57 were dubious positive (9.3%), and 384 were negative (63.0%) (Figure 1A and Table 1). Among the 384 patients with initial negative results, the second test was performed. For these patients, the test results were positive in 48 cases (12.5%), dubiously positive in 27 patients (7.0%), negative in 280 patients (72.9%), and results were not available for 29 patients (7.6%) (Figure 1B and Table 2). Among the patients with initial non\u2010positive results, seven patients were eventually confirmed with COVID\u201019 by three repeated swab PCR tests, four were confirmed by four repeated tests, and one was confirmed by five repeated tests (Figure 1D and Table 3). In the patients confirmed as COVID\u201019, 17 patients have positive RT\u2010PCR results for pharyngeal swab specimens at first, and their PCR results turned to be negative after treatment for several days. However, again several days later when the patient's symptoms improved, their PCR results returned to be positive (Figure 1D and Table 4). Among them, one patient's RT\u2010PCR result turned positive after two consecutive negative tests (Figure 1D and Table 4). The sub\u2010networks of frequencies and average intervals of resulting transformations are shown in Figure 2. The sub\u2010networks of result transformations were completed before the fourth test, which means negative results may turn to non\u2010negtive (including positive and suspicious positive) results even after three times tests (Figure 2A and Table 5). After the fourth test, no negative case turned to positive, only to suspicious positive. After the fifth test, neither suspicious nor negative results transformed to positive (Figure 2A and Table 5). The RT\u2010PCR tests were implemented in clinic with longer intervals during the positive\u2010suspicious\u2010negative processes than during the negative\u2010suspicious\u2010positive processes (the Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test: P = 5.706e\u221209) (Figure 2B and Table 6).",
