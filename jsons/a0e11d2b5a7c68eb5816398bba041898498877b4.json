This may be accomplished by the use of a conventional nasal cannula or a facemask. Commonly used oxygen-delivery devices are described in Table 1 . Current guidelines in nonpregnant individuals suggest starting oxygen therapy with peripheral SpO 2 levels below 92% and recommend its use when levels are below 90%. 2 Based on physiologic changes in pregnancy (eg, increased oxygen demand and a physiologic increase in partial pressure of oxygen), we suggest starting oxygen therapy in pregnant patients when SpO 2 values fall below 94%. Therapy should be titrated to avoid SpO 2 levels above 96%. 2 Once oxygen supplementation is initiated, obstetricians should involve personnel expert in airway management (eg, an anesthesiologist) in case endotracheal intubation is required later. Together with oxygen therapy, asking the patient to lay down in bed prone (awake self-prone position) appears to improve oxygenation (likely by anterior displacement of the mediastinum and improved posterior lung recruitment). 3 The latter may be considered in pregnant patients at less than 20 weeks of gestation.",

We recommend that maintenance fluids be avoided in pregnant patients with acute COVID-19 infection and oxygen desaturation (SpO 2 less than 94%). If daily positive fluid balances are present combined with worsening respiratory status, the use of furosemide (10-20 mg intravenously every 12 hours) may be indicated.

Once improvement is noted, the FiO 2 should be weaned before the flow is decreased, because the flow provides alveolar recruitment (high flow of air results in 3-5 cmH 2 O of positive pressure ventilation, keeping more alveoli open). We recommend that, once the FiO 2 is 0.4-0.5, the flow may be weaned gradually by decreases of 5-10 L/min every 4-6 hours as tolerated to maintain the SpO 2 level above 94%.",
