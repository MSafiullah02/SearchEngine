This enables the flow of specific intercellular signals and metabolic cooperation between communicating cells in a tissue. The importance of such communication is shown by the increasing number of human diseases that are directly attributable to mutants and deficiencies of the gap junction protein, connexin [2]. Mutations range from those that subtly change gap junctional permeability [3] to mutations that cause severe changes in connexin trafficking and that completely inhibit gap junctional coupling 4, 5, 6, 7.",

Connexins do not ubiquitously intermix; instead, compatibility is based on their protein structure. When two connexins expressed in the same cell form a mixed channel, this is referred to as heteromeric compatibility. Examples of heteromeric channels formed by endogenously expressed connexins include Cx32\u2013Cx26 in the liver 15, 18, Cx46\u2013Cx50 in the lens [19] and Cx43\u2013Cx46 in the lung [20]. Heteromeric connexin compatibility has been tested using transfected cell models, although there are many combinations that have not been examined. The heteromeric compatibility groups correspond loosely to \u03b1 and \u03b2 connexin subfamiles 15, 17. Connexins that do not belong in either of these subgroups have been found to form heteromers with either \u03b1 connexins (e.g. Cx45\u2013Cx43) [21] or \u03b2 connexins (e.g. mCx29\u2013Cx32) [22].

Heterotypic channels have been identified in several settings in vivo, most notably in the central nervous system (CNS), in which astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are interconnected exclusively through heterotypic channels 26, 27. Although such gap junctions can contain channels with unique permeability characteristics, a more prominent role for specific heterotypic interactions is to form intercellular networks by either promoting or restricting cell interconnectivity. Disulfide bridges that interconnect the two extracellular domains are crucial for channel formation 28, 29. Two key amino acids in the second extracellular loop are the major determinants of heterotypic compatibility 15, 30, although motifs in the first extracellular loop and other parts of the protein might also have a role [31]. In contrast to innate heteromeric compatibility, innate heterotypic compatibility does not correlate well with whether a given connexin is an \u03b1 or \u03b2 family member 15, 32. For example, Cx32 and Cx43 cannot form heterotypic channels; however, the \u03b1 connexins Cx46 and Cx50 can form heterotypic channels with either Cx32 or Cx43 [30]. In addition, some connexins, including Cx31 and Cx36, appear to only form homotypic channels 32, 33.",

These cells express different levels of Cx37, Cx40 and Cx43, all of which can hetero-oligomerize with one another; this has been demonstrated in transfected cell models [17]. Using a co-culture model, in which the cells maintained polarity and phenotype, Isakson and Duling [36] found that Cx37 was specifically excluded from myoendothelial junctions between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Instead, Cx37 was incorporated into junctions interconnecting either two adjacent endothelial cells or two adjacent smooth muscle cells. This suggests that the vasculature regulates connexin hetero-oligomerization and uses polarized delivery of connexins to different plasma membrane domains to produce three distinct classes of cell\u2013cell interface that influence intercellular signaling pathways. Polarized connexin targeting also has a role in regulating heteromer formation in the CNS 22, 26, 27 and oocyte\u2013granulosa cell interfaces 37, 38. The mechanisms to control connexin hetero-oligomerization and trafficking are not well defined at present. In particular, connexin trafficking in cultured polarized cell models must be studied to define roles for differential connexin targeting to apical and basolateral secretory pathways involved in regulating the formation of heteromeric and heterotypic gap junction channels.",

Although this has been cited as evidence that connexin oligomerization naturally occurs in the ER, another possibility is that microsomes lack components of the quality-control apparatus that are present in the intact ER and that inhibit connexin oligomerization. Consistent with this, addition of liver Golgi membranes to the in vitro translation microsome mix enhances Cx32 oligomerization and promotes the formation of Cx26\u2013Cx32 heteromers [18]. Also, the ER pool of Cx32 in guinea pig liver is monomeric, although the ER pool of Cx26 does show partial oligomerization [46].

This is a particular problem when analyzing the assembly of connexins transfected into cells because overexpression could drive premature connexin oligomerization. For example, overexpression initiates the formation of intracellular plaque-like structures in the ER of transfected BHK cells suggesting aberrant connexin assembly [47]. Overexpressed newly synthesized connexins, including Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43, oligomerized in the ER, whereas endogenous Cx32 and Cx43 expressed at much lower levels did not (J.K. VanSlyke and L.S. Musil, personal communication); however, transfected HeLa cells have been used to show that Cx26 oligomerizes following exit from the ER [24]. Cx43 overexpression induces premature oligomerization [48] and it has been suggested that overexpression might underlie some of the conflicting results obtained using transfected cell models to study connexin trafficking and oligomerization 7, 49. Taken together, these results suggest that care should be taken in producing and interpreting these models. Conversely, it is plausible that there might be physiological circumstances in which high levels of connexin expression might regulate hexamer formation by inducing early connexin oligomerization in the ER, although, to date, this has not been directly demonstrated in a system examining endogenously expressed connexins.",

            "text": "Although unusual, transmembrane protein oligomerization in a post-ER secretory compartment is not unique to connexins. For example, targeting of coronavirus coat proteins [50] and Golgi resident enzymes [51] correlates with oligomerization in the Golgi apparatus. Remodeling and assembly of ion channels, such as ENaC and Na-K ATPases, can occur in late secretory compartments and at the plasma membrane 52, 53, 54. Another class of proteins that oligomerize in the Golgi apparatus are tetraspanins, such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 [55]. However, tetraspanins also hetero-oligomerize with several other classes of transmembrane protein, such as integrins, in the ER 56, 57 (Box 1).Box 1A tetraspanin\u2013connexin connection?Tetraspanins have been called molecular facilitators because of their ability to promote the assembly and trafficking of several classes of transmembrane proteins 86, 87. Although tetraspanins and connexins both span the bilayer four times and have similar protein orientation in the bilayer, they are structurally distinct and not homologous [88].Intermolecular interactions involving tetraspanins are complex, because tetraspanins form homologous complexes with other tetraspanins and form heterologous complexes with other transmembrane proteins (e.g. integrins or class II major histocompatibility complex proteins). Tetraspanin\u2013protein complexes form in the ER and the Golgi apparatus. In addition to direct interactions with other proteins, tetraspanins facilitate the formation of large-scale heterogeneous membrane lipid\u2013protein complexes. The ability of tetraspanins to form large membrane microdomains is enhanced by palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that occurs in the Golgi apparatus.One parallel between connexins and tetraspanins is that they partition into cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains. Given this, and the prominent role of post-ER compartments in connexin and tetraspanin oligomerization, it is tempting to speculate that the formation of higher order complexes by these protein families might share common features. Also, given that tetraspanins function as molecular facilitators in the Golgi apparatus to regulate trafficking of other classes of junction and cell adhesion proteins, it is plausible that tetraspanins might also help regulate connexin oligomerization and/or trafficking. Further work will be required to determine whether this is the case.",

Although these are useful tools for identifying early events in protein assembly, they can also alter the composition of the secretory pathway [58] and can induce stress responses that are due to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER [59]. Given these potential pitfalls, connexin chimeras containing a di-lysine-based C-terminal ER retention\u2013retrieval sequence, HKKSL, were used to study early events in connexin oligomerization 60, 61. Consistent with Cx43 oligomerization in the Golgi apparatus or TGN, ER-localized Cx43\u2013HKKSL is monomeric. In contrast to Cx43, ER-localized Cx32\u2013HKKSL oligomerizes.

            "text": "Given that Cx32\u2013HKKSL that was localized to the ER was oligomerized, does Cx32 normally oligomerize in the ER? This is possible; however, although the HKKSL motif is a strong ER retention signal, it also acts as a retrieval signal for proteins that have escaped from the ER [62]. Access and retrieval of proteins containing di-lysine motifs from the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and, to a lesser extent, the cis Golgi stack form a retrograde recycling pathway, which contributes to quality control in the secretory pathway 63, 64. By contrast, ER retrieval of di-lysine-containing proteins from late Golgi compartments and the TGN is relatively rare [65]. Consistent with this, a small fraction of Cx43\u2013HKKSL escapes from the ER retrieval pathway and forms functional gap junction channels [60]. Thus, an alternative explanation to Cx32\u2013HKKSL oligomerization in the ER is that Cx32\u2013HKKSL oligomerizes in a compartment such as the ERGIC, where they are efficiently retrieved by the di-lysine tag. Given this and the arguments presented here that support connexin oligomerization after exit from the ER, I propose a model that favors the ERGIC as a major intracellular compartment in which Cx32 oligomerizes (Figure 4).",

This type of control is more important for inherently compatible connexins, such as Cx37 and Cx43 or Cx43 and Cx46, as opposed to inherently incompatible connexins, such as Cx32 and Cx43.

Several connexins partition into biochemically isolated microdomains 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 and contain binding motifs for a microdomain-associated protein, caveolin-1 [73]. Whether connexins associate with microdomains enriched for caveolin-1 depends on the preparation technique.

            "text": "As caveolin-1 has been co-localized to gap junction plaques [72], it has been suggested that the plaques themselves are located in microdomains. However, accumulating evidence suggests that connexins are present in membrane microdomains before incorporation into gap junctions 71, 73. For example, connexin-containing microdomain fractions are enriched in glycosphingolipids, whereas the glycosphingolipid content of gap junction plaques is low [73]. Also, in studies of ZO-1, a connexin-binding scaffold protein 76, 77, Laing et al.\n[71] showed that cells expressing a dominant-negative ZO-1 construct had an increase in microdomain-associated Cx43, which localized to the region of the Golgi apparatus. By contrast, overexpressing wild-type functional ZO-1 enhanced Cx43 transport to the plasma membrane and enhanced gap junction plaque formation. Although this suggests that functional ZO-1 might enhance the transition of Cx43 from microdomains to gap junction plaques, ZO-1 binding is not an absolute requirement for their formation, because connexins that do not bind to ZO-1 can form plaques 73, 77, 78. In fact, ZO-1 might also serve to limit plaque size [77]. In general, studies that focus strictly on binary connexin\u2013ZO-1 interactions should be interpreted with caution. For example, the effect of mutant or wild-type ZO-1 on connexins might be indirect because these proteins might interfere with or promote the binding of other proteins to the connexin C terminus.",
