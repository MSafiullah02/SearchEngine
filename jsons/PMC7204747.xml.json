This article comes at a unique time in our medical and social history, given the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic due to causative pathogen SARS-CoV-2 (2). At this time, issues of critical care triage and stewardship, along with general concerns with resource utilization and planning, prove paramount.",

As we gather more data on the constellation of risk factors that heighten risk of ICU admission, we can then move to prediction models that allow application of these findings to individual patients. Specifically, using the odds ratios of the individual risk factors from regression analysis, can the authors provide the readership a contemporary, weighted risk calculator for prospective use? We would ask the authors consider this in a future publication, incorporating previously described methodology (3).",

Can we predict how these urgent and revision cases may influence overall resource management (5, 6)? Can we adequately predict unplanned ICU admission for primary and revision cases once we return back to the operating room when the COVID-19 disease curve normalizes? These questions not only would strengthen the authors\u2019 current report, but might be used to better understand who might be at risk for higher acuity of care across all orthopedic subspecialties, when urgent cases are deemed necessary, and to plan appropriately in this time of crisis. Conversely, this may allow for selection of patients of lower risk for both the inpatient or outpatient setting to mitigate use of ICU care in the setting of high residual occupancy.",
