These infections are mostly limited to tracheobronchitis in healthy individuals but can cause severe viral pneumonias in immunocompromised patients. While influenza is one of the best-known causes of pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ICU), this presentation is frequently related to bacterial superinfection, such as with Staphylococcus aureus.4 Some of the rarity of viral pneumonia can be attributed to the types of cells that viruses can infect, termed tropism. Thus, while the more common influenza strains (like H1N1) target cells in the trachea and bronchi, influenza pneumonia is particularly linked to avian strains (like H5N1) that skip the upper respiratory epithelium and infect alveolar epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract.5",

While beta-coronaviruses have been around for more than 5,000 yr, outbreaks of lethal strains of SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2012 have added to their notoriety.6 SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 all likely originated in bats, with SARS-CoV using civets as intermediary hosts and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus passing though camels. Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are implicated in the passage of SARS-CoV-2 to humans on the basis of sequence similarity with pangolin coronaviruses.7",

The \u201ccorona\u201d description references the crown-like halo of viral spike (S) proteins observed by electron microscopy (fig. 1). Variations in this S-protein determine which proteins coronavirions use to enter cells. Early investigations into SARS-CoV-2 suggest that it uses tissue angiotensin converting enzyme-2 as its receptor, a trait shared with SARS, but not Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus or more common endemic human coronaviruses such as OC43 and HKU1.8,9 Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 is expressed in the lower respiratory tract but not bronchi, as well as enterocytes in the small intestine.10 Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 dependence may explain the clinical presentations of lower respiratory tract infection and enteritis in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression in vascular endothelium and cardiac myocytes has also been implicated in acute cardiac injury resulting from COVID-19.11 In animal models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers increase angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression and activity, respectively, leading to speculation that these medications could possibly potentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection.12 Major cardiology societies do not recommend changing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonist treatments based on COVID-19 risk at this time.13 Other sites express angiotensin converting enzyme-2, such as the tongue and parts of the genitourinary tract, but the clinical significance of this finding in COVID-19 is unclear.14 Binding of S-protein to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 likely contributes directly to pathogenesis, resulting in downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2, increased production of angiotensin II, and resulting increased pulmonary vascular permeability.15 While SARS-CoV-2\u2013susceptible angiotensin converting enzyme-2 appears universally expressed in humans, there may be genetic variations regulating angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression that could lead to differential susceptibilities across populations and genotypes.16",

These polypeptides are subsequently divided by viral proteases, yielding the viral replication machinery. Coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to shield viral RNA from host detection and subsequent induction of antiviral interferon responses, including direct antagonism of interferon signaling proteins and replication of viral RNA in double membrane vesicles.15 Nonetheless, COVID-19 strongly induces cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-\u03b1, suggesting a broad type 1 and type 2 helper T-cell response.17 It remains uncertain to what extent direct viral cytotoxicity versus the host cytokine storm and other immune responses contributes to morbidity in COVID-19.",

Commercially available molecular tests for endemic coronaviruses, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, USA) do not detect SARS-CoV-229 currently. It is expected that SARS-CoV-2 will be added soon.30 Chest computed tomography may have higher sensitivity for COVID-19 infection, with a sensitivity as high as 97% in one study.29 Based on challenges with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing, computed tomography imaging has been proposed as a primary tool for COVID-19 detection in hospitalized patients in epidemic areas. However, within the first 2 days after symptom onset, the majority of patients may have normal computed tomography imaging.28 Thus, early in the disease course, there may be no diagnostic sufficiently sensitive to exclude COVID-19.",

For example, immunosenescence could contribute to the increased risk among the aged. As individuals age, the frequency of naive B and T cells diminishes, implying less capacity to recognize and adapt to novel antigens. At the same time, aged immune cells have less proliferative and functional capacity even when responding to known antigens. Such age-related changes in cellular immunity manifest in decreased vaccine effectiveness, worse outcomes in the setting of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and herpes zoster infections,41 and have been demonstrated in mouse models of coronavirus infection.18 As the lung ages, the airway epithelium restorative capacity is also diminished. Telomere dysfunction is one biologic mechanism of aging, which primarily manifests as pulmonary fibrosis but can also restrict leukocyte proliferation. It is conceivable that poor outcomes from COVID-19 could be linked to short telomeres, as has been reported with pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS, and sepsis.42,43 It is also possible that younger individuals may have differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, in the rat lung, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression decreases with age.44 Children also could benefit from immunity developed from other coronavirus infections. Indeed, modest cross-reactivity was observed between endemic coronaviruses, such as OC43 and SARS-CoV.45 This potentially protective cross-reactive immunity would be limited by age and immunosenescence. If fecal\u2013oral transmission resulted in a milder gastroenteritis presentation of SARS-CoV-2, it is also conceivable that children could be subsequently protected from the COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. While we currently can only speculate as to the causes of variation in COVID-19 presentations, these mechanisms likely hold important clues that will inform management and therapeutics.",

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare workers has been reported, and infection control is of primary importance to protect healthcare workers and prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2.24,54 The World Health Organization guideline recommends, in addition to routine standard precautions, that providers use droplet and contact precautions when caring for any patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the addition of airborne precautions when any aerosol-generating procedure, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is performed.49 Additional guidelines and frontline reports from groups in Hubei province suggest many providers are utilizing airborne precautions at all times while caring for COVID-19 patients as an additional safety measure.50,51",

A recent study reported a high (greater than 40%) rate of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.61 In this study, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure was associated with increased mortality, as was the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with more severe ARDS (Pao2/Fio2 less than 150 mmHg).61 Several authors have suggested that the increased mortality observed when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is used in patients with more severe ARDS and in those who ultimately require invasive mechanical ventilation may be explained by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delaying time to a needed intubation, and from lung injury caused by uncontrolled high tidal volumes with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.58,60,62 There are limited data to suggest that when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered via helmet to patients with ARDS, failure rates and mortality may be lower than when a conventional noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask is used. While a helmet mask may be additionally beneficial from an infection control perspective, this intervention is not widely available.63",

            "text": "There is substantial concern that using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula in patients with viral respiratory illness results in increased production of aerosolized virus particles, creating a risk for healthcare workers or contaminating the clinical environment. While multiple studies from the 2003 SARS epidemic have identified participation in tracheal intubation as a risk factor for viral spread to healthcare workers, noninvasive ventilation was only identified as a risk factor in two small studies not considered robust enough to establish the risk of transmission in a 2012 meta-analysis.66\u201368 Experimental studies of exhaled air dispersion by mannequins in isolation rooms using conventional low flow nasal cannula, high flow nasal cannula, and continuous positive airway pressure with nasal pillows or full facemask, demonstrated greater exhaled air dispersion with conventional low flow nasal cannula at 5 l/min (up to 1 m from the patient\u2019s face) as compared with either high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure.69,70 The authors postulated that lower exhaled air dispersion from high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure masks could be related to tighter fit to the face with these modalities, and also that the humidified air generated by these modalities could result in exhalation of larger droplets with a shorter trajectory due to gravity.70 The use of a full noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask might also prevent spread of aerosolized droplets in a patient who is sneezing or coughing.53 Thus, there is a risk that any method of oxygen delivery to a patient with COVID-19\u2013associated respiratory distress can result in spread of virus-containing exhaled air, especially if the mask is poorly fitted or leaking, but the concern that use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula specifically leads to worse environmental contamination is not substantiated by the current available evidence. Patients receiving any supplemental oxygen therapy should be cared for in airborne isolation rooms whenever possible, with staff using full contact, droplet, and airborne isolation precautions.51,71 Providers should be aware that coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days, and all surfaces and equipment used for SARS-2-CoV\u2013infected patients should be carefully disinfected with 70% or greater ethanol for small surfaces or 0.1% or greater sodium hypochlorite for larger surfaces.72",

The United Kingdom ARDS guidelines weakly recommend consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia, although this recommendation was published before the results of a randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for ARDS, which was stopped early due to lack of a statistically significant mortality benefit between the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group and the medical management group.78,79,837882 However, a re-analysis of the data from this trial, as well as a meta-analysis incorporating these new trial data, suggest that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may provide a mortality benefit in patients with severe ARDS.84 In a small case-control series during the Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus outbreak, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia was associated with lower in-hospital mortality.85 Considering these data, it may be reasonable to refer COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in centers with the expertise and resources to properly manage such complex patients.49,50",

As described above, a number of antiviral drugs have shown promise in vitro. Even a partially effective antiviral could allow sufficient reduction in viral load so that the immune system can recover and respond to prevent lethal disease. There is even potential that antivirals could be used in chemoprophylaxis to prevent transmission in recently exposed individuals. While resistance to antivirals developed quickly in patients with HIV, studies in coronaviruses suggest this might be less of a problem.100 Similarly, while HIV readily evades cellular and humoral immunity, sharply limiting vaccination approaches,101 SARS-CoV infection appeared to induce broad and long-lasting immunity with less evidence of immune escape.102 Thus, it is likely that as COVID-19 evolves, physicians will have a variety of therapeutic and vaccination options to minimize morbidity and mortality. Until these arrive, anesthesiologists will be called upon to provide supportive care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission to themselves and others.",

Notable coronavirus structural proteins include the spike protein (S), which mediates receptor binding and fusion, the viral membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). After binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, virions enter cells either by receptor-mediated endocytosis or direct fusion with the cell membrane.15 Endocytosis is a potential target of chloroquine, which prevents endosomal acidification that triggers viral membrane fusion. Chloroquine may also modify ACE2 terminal glycosylation and inhibit coronavirus binding. Viral RNA is then transcribed to generate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that are cleaved by a protease to generate the viral replication machinery. These polyproteins are cleaved to form replication-transcription protein complexes (RTCs) by a viral protease 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). 3CLpro has been postulated to be a target of human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors lopinavir or ritonavir, although in silico studies have questioned this theory.108 Viral RNA is replicated and transcribed in double membraned vesicles (DMV) in replication-transcription protein complexes, which include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is the putative target of remdesivir.
