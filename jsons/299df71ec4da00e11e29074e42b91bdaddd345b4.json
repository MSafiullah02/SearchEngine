We provide a working model for sensor technology to support diff erent parts of the tissue fabrication pathway. We next look at biological sensors in nature, with IGF-1 signaling as an example and study the intracellular signaling events which take place in response to IGF-1 signaling. Next, we look at the design requirements for sensors to support the culture and fabrication of 3D artifi cial tissue. The next three sections are dedicated to three specifi c sensing mechanisms, which include acoustic sensors, magnetic sensors and optical sensors. For each of the three sensor mechanism, we provide an overview of the theory, along with some applications to illustrate the principles of operation. We then look at fl exible sensors and how they have been used for various applications and the potential role of fl exible sensors in tissue engineering. We conclude this chapter by providing a case study from the Artifi cial Heart Laboratory; the case study is focused on the development of novel sensors to record the EKG properties of 3D artifi cial heart muscle.",

            "text": "Current State of the Art -During tissue and organ fabrication, it is important to monitor and record changes in tissue function. How is this accomplished based on the current state of the art? During the tissue fabrication process, isolated cells and later, 3D tissue are maintained in culture for several days and oft en times, for weeks. During this culture period, individual tissue culture plates are removed from the controlled culture environment at intermittent time points. While the time period for functional assessment varies, a common strategy is to record functional properties every 2-3 days. Once the tissue culture plates are removed, the 3D tissue constructs are attached to external sensors for functional recording. Th e functional properties are then recorded for a specifi c time period, say for 1-2 min. During functional assessment, the 3D artifi cial tissue is exposed to the external environment and is physically handled during functional assessment. As a result, the properties of the 3D tissue are altered during functional assessment. Aft er functional assessment, the 3D tissue is sacrifi ced. Th is process is repeated at several time points during the tissue culture process. Let's look at one example. During the fabrication of 3D artifi cial heart muscle, researchers are oft en interested in measuring changes in the contractile properties as a function culture time. In order to measure contractile properties, the tissue culture plate is fi rst removed from the cell culture incubator. One end of the 3D heart muscle tissue is then connected to an external force transducer. Changes in contractile properties are then recorded in response to electrical stimulation or in response to changes in calcium or some other chemical compound. Th ere are several limitations of this method. First, attachment of 3D artifi cial heart muscle to the external force transducers requires physical handling of the 3D tissue and this process inherently changes tissue properties. Second, data collection is only for a short period of time and provides information about 3D artifi cial heart muscle at a single time point; such data is limited and cannot be used to make any conclusions about the contractile properties as a function of time. Th ird and less obvious, is the limitation of the current generation of force transducers, which do not have the high level of sensitivity required to measure small changes in tissue functionality. Forth, any data obtained for the contractile properties of 3D artifi cial heart muscle cannot be used to change the culture environment in a positive feedback loop that regulates the culture environment. Th ese limitations point to the need for a new generation of sensors that are better equipped to record changes in the functional performance of 3D artifi cial tissue and provide data that can be used to regulate the tissue and organ fabrication process.",

Binding of IGF-1 to the extracellular components of the IGF-1R result in activation of the intracellular kinase domains located in the \u03b2-subunits of the receptors. Ligand activated kinase activity is responsible for triggering intracellular signaling events; this process requires participation of several proteins along the signal transduction pathway. SHC and insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are proteins that act as intermediary factors between ligand activated kinase and intracellular signaling cascades. Th ese intermediate proteins are supported by many other proteins, including Grb2, GTPbinding protein RAS, Sos, c-Raf, MEK, ERK1 and ERK2. IGF-1 binding to IGR-1R is known to have an eff ect on cell proliferation resulting from a prolonged transition through all phases of the cell cycle. IGF-1 signaling acts to regulate cellular apoptosis serving as an anti-apoptotic agent; the signal transduction pathway involved in the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 involves the P13K-Akt pathway. In cardiac myocytes, IGF-1 signaling has shown to initiate a complex sequence of signaling events which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium, which in turn increases mitochondrial respiration and metabolism.",

Th e method made use of competitive binding of glucose and dextran on concanavalin A (ConA) binding sites on the surface of grapheme coated QCM-D sensors. Dextran molecules were assembled on the surface of the modifi ed QCM-D sensors and ConA molecules were then immobilized on the dextran. Varying concentrations of glucose were added to the detection chamber, which competed with dextran for ConA binding sites. Glucose has a higher affi nity for the binding sites compared with dextran and this resulted in displacement of the dextran from the surface of the QCM-D sensor; this was accompanied by a decrease in acoustic wave frequency. It was demonstrated that an increase in glucose concentration in the range of 0.01-7.5 mM was related to a linear decrease in acoustic wave frequency.

Ellipsometry is based on the principle that the properties of polarized light change aft er being refl ected off the surface of any material [ 92 , 93 ] . Th e changes in the properties of polarized light are measured by \u03c8 and \u0394, where \u03c8 is a measure of the diff erential change in amplitude and \u0394 is the diff erential change in phase [ 92 , 93 ] . Based on the relative changes in phase (\u0394) and amplitude (\u03c8), surface properties can be obtained [ 92 , 93 ] . Changes in \u0394 and \u03c8 are measured in terms of a ratio, known as the complex refl ectance ratio, which is based on changes in the vectors of refl ected light.

Any changes in surface thickness will be correlated to changes in the properties of the refl ected light and computed using the ratio r p /r s . Th ere are several cases during the tissue fabrication process where this technique can prove to be valuable. As one example, in the case of biological applications, the culture surface is oft en coated with adhesion proteins and cells attach to these adhesion properties via specifi c integrin mediated cell-matrix interactions. At every stage of this process, there are measurable changes in the surface thickness, which can be accurately deducted using ellipsometry. As the cells attach to specifi c proteins, the changes in the surface thickness can be measured using ellipsometry. A more direct application of ellipsometry during tissue engineering is the calculation of the thickness of thin fi lms, which are oft en deposited on the culture surface to support cellular adhesion and proliferation. Th e thickness of the fi lms is an important determinant of cell adhesion and function, which can accurately be measured using optical techniques like ellipsometry.",

Th e sensitivity of the assay was reported to be 10 9 pfu/ml.

Skin-like pressure sensors fabricated with PDMS elastic fi lms of carbon nanotubes are used as electrode arrays of fl exible capacitors, which serve as strain and pressure sensors [ 134 ] . Flexible self-powered, self-healing, highly sensitive (as high as 0.4 Pa), transparent nanogenerators were fabricated by assembling a PDMS microstructure and PET/ITO substrate into micropyramidal patterned arrays, the structure of which increased the effi ciency of the nanogenerator [ 109 ] .",

First, fl exible sensors can be highly sensitive and multifunctional depending on a variety of parameters, which grants the tailoring of the system to the pertinent detection application. Second, fl exible type systems have high bendability that allow them to be used in a wide range of biological applications, such as direct contact with organs or as wearable sensors. Th ird, fl exible sensors are highly elastic, which give the ability to move with and grow with the organ or tissue as it develops. Fourth, fl exible sensors have been designed to be biocompatible with their target specimens so as to limit rejection and be affi xed to the tissue/organ without and immunological response from the host's immune system. And lastly, fl exible electrodes can be manufactured at a low cost with a geometrically controlled shape for specifi c applications. Additionally, the polymers used for the development of these devices do not only play a crucial role in their fl exibility, but also act as a layer that provides direct contact and attachment to the target specimen, as well as, allow for the transfer of various electrical and mechanical inputs.",

In one such study, highly sensitive fl exible pressure sensors were developed by joining microstructured PDMS dielectric layers that were used in the fabrication of e-skins that mimic the tactile sensing properties of natural skin. It was demonstrated during this study that both the sensitivity and pressure range are adjustable by changing the shape of the PDMS structures and this system exhibited higher-pressure sensitivity than that seen in unstructured elastomeric fi lms of similar thickness [ 4 ] . In a second example, fl exible biosensors were used to fabricate an epidermal electronic system that served as a wearable device to monitor temperature, strain, and other electrophysiological properties of the skin. Th is device was fabricated through the integration of active/passive circuit elements, microscale LEDs, wireless power coils, and devices for radio frequency that were integrated on the surface of a ~30 \u03bcm elastomeric sheet. Th e device was mounted on a watersoluble PVA fi lm that dissolved to leave the sensors fi rmly attached to the skin [ 8 ] . In a third example, a fl exible sensing device was fabricated with ultrathin (2.5 \u03bcm) spin-cast fi lms of polyimide (PI) as a support for arrays of electrodes designed for direct contact passive neural recording in feline brains due to low bending stiff ness. Th e device was laminated with an absorbable fi broin substrate, which dissolved when in contact with biofl uid and left the device in direct contact with the brain to provide mapping of physiological signals with appropriate spatial distribution [ 132 ] . In a fourth and last example, a composite material composed of a supramolecular organic polymer with embedded nickel nanostructured microparticles was fabricated. Th is device shows mechanical and electrical self-healing properties at ambient conditions. Th e electrical conductivity can be tuned by varying the amount of nickel particles and can reach values as high as 40 S/cm. Th is study demonstrates that natural skin's repeatable self-healing capability can be mimicked in conductive and piezoresistive materials [ 135 ] . All of these examples serve to illustrate the extensive use and ability of fl exible biosensors to accurately measure diff erent metric in a wide variety of applications.",

Understanding the electrical properties of the heart can aid researchers in the development of cardiac tissues that can be used to augment, repair and/or replace damaged portions of the heart. During normal mammalian function the electrical activity of the heart plays a central role to support atrial and ventricular contraction. Th e process of the contraction of the heart starts when the electrical signals arise in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which spontaneously generates propagating action potentials at regular intervals. Th ese electric potential spreads to both the right and left atrium as both atria are electrically coupled. Th e electrical impulse then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node through the internodal pathways. Following a delay at the AV node the electrical signal is conducted by the bundle of His and Purkinje fi bers to the apex of the heart. Th e depolarization of cardiac myocytes initiates propagation of the electrical current at the intercellular level through the gap junctions. Excitation of each cardiomyocyte leads to an increase in calcium that subsequently generates heart muscle contraction [ 136 ] . Understanding the electrophysiological properties of cardiac constructs developed in laboratories, and replicating values found in vivo is important to move towards implantation of such constructs in a clinical environment. To achieve this goal, systems need to be developed that are capable of evaluating EKG properties in real time for diff erent types of constructs. Two types of system are described here, those used for 3D artifi cial heart muscle (3D-AHM) and those used for more complex organs such as whole bioengineered artifi cial hearts (BAHs), bioengineered artifi cial ventricles (BAVs), and tissue engineered heart pumps (TEHPs).",

Th e ability to replicate mammalian electrophysiology is imperative to the success of the artifi cial tissue. By monitoring changes the tissues undergo during formation, development, and maturation we can further interpret the electrical propagation within each specimen. Prior to in vivo utilization, it is important that 3D-AHM's electrophysiological properties be at a level to remain viable to each specimen's scope of application. To gather these metrics we have designed a 32-channel direct contact system to evaluate the electrical properties of the tissue fabricated in our lab (. Fig. 2.8a ). With this system we are able to acquire conduction velocities, optical maps, and other metrics associated with the electrical properties of our tissues. However, this system is invasive and can lead to damage of the tissue constructs. For this reason we have designed a second system that consists of a 16-channel electrode board that provides direct contact with the tissue, while remaining noninvasive and minimizing damage to the tissues (. Fig. 2.8b ). Th is system allows us to obtain the same data that could be acquired with the fi rst system, while minimizing damage to the cardiac constructs.",
