Volunteers were vaccinated in the morning and were monitored regularly for at least 24 hours after the administration of the vaccine before they were released. Temperature, blood pressure and heart rate were documented 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after each vaccination. The volunteers documented all solicited and unsolicited adverse events in a diary up to study day 56. Body temperature was assessed orally daily on days 1-14 and 29-42 (in the evenings). The diary was written on days 3, 7, 14, 28, 29, 35, 42 and 56. Laboratory safety tests were assessed during ambulatory visits on days 3, 7, 14, 28, 29, 35, 42 and included a full blood count, electrolytes, 70 liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein and Troponin T measurements.",

Data on solicited adverse events were collected for 14 days after each injection. Solicited events included both local (pain, induration, erythema/redness, hematoma, and swelling at injection site) and systemic adverse events; namely fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, loose stool, abdominal cramps, and nausea). Unsolicited adverse events were all other events not listed above and all events that arose between days 14 and 28 as well as after day 42 (14 days after the booster vaccination). The occurrence of serious adverse events (SAE) was monitored throughout the study. An SAE was defined as any event that results in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient 80 hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent disability or required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Adverse events were listed and graded for each participant according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA: AE grade 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The severity of adverse events was assessed using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE version 4) and the FDA's 2007 voluntary guidance and is defined in the study protocol. In general, adverse events were considered as mild if the event did not interfere with activities of daily living, as moderate when they interfered with daily living activities, but did not pose significant or permanent risks to the participants, while severe adverse events significantly affected daily living and clinical status.",

Spot detection, ELISpot image acquisition and analyses were performed using AID ELISpot Robotic System (AID GmbH, Germany). Spot forming cells (SFC) were calculated using the geometric mean of triplicates. DMSO controls were used to normalize the data. A positive response was defined using two criteria: first, a response >50 SFC per 1 M PBMCs and secondly, a four-fold value over the baseline (day 0).
