It aims at providing a description of the global risk picture; assisting States in their efforts to protect air transportation and prevent its use for unlawful acts; presenting high-level statements for an improved approach in creating and maintaining State national civil aviation security programmes; and assisting ICAO in improving Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and guidance material. The Statement focused the attention of ICAO member States to Standard 3.1.3 of Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) which requires each State to keep under constant review the level of threat to civil aviation within its territory, and establish and implement policies and procedures to adjust relevant elements of its national civil aviation security programme, based on a security risk assessment carried out by relevant national authorities. The Conference, based on this fundamental premise, recognized that a reasonably designed risk-based approach is one by which States identify the criteria to measure potential criminal activities, principally from terrorism. The identification of risks permits States to determine and implement proportionate measures and controls to mitigate against each risk type.",

It cautions that the consequence of a threat associated with insiders might be greater if an insider has access deeper within the system. For instance, an insider could perpetrate a more credible and thus more disruptive hoax. In summary, the Statement explains that the methodology involves considering each role within the system and whether it offers a particular tactical advantage in relation to each threat type or whether it poses the same issues as passengers, and that, in applying this methodology, it is possible to consider insider vulnerabilities as part of an integrated risk assessment.",

In this regard it was recognized that an international capacity building strategy for air cargo and mail security would draw on the ICAO Assistance and Capacity Building Strategy for Aviation Security , and allow for targeted assistance for States in need. This Strategy would be guided by the ICAO security audit results, where air cargo and mail security has been identified as a priority need. The Strategy would include a proposal to coordinate bilateral and multilateral capacity building initiatives regionally, as well as amongst international organizations such as the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in order to align such initiatives, maximize limited resources, and avoid duplication of efforts. The development of such a strategy would also be in line with the ICAO Comprehensive Aviation Security Strategy (ICASS) 2011\u20132016 that was endorsed at the 37th ICAO Assembly in 2010.",

In encouraging this capacity building to continue, the proposed framework seeks to better coordinate and inform its development by building on existing and future Government-to-Government arrangements with targeted industry-to-industry capacity building efforts, and using ICAO-sponsored capacity building where regional \u201cgaps\u201d in bilateral, multilateral and industry capacity building efforts are identified.",

The Conference endorsed the development of an International Capacity Building Strategy specific to air cargo and mail security, to aid those ICAO member States that require assistance to adequately implement enhanced ICAO air cargo and mail security standards. This Strategy was to be aligned with the ICAO Assistance and Capacity Building Strategy for Aviation Security, and avoid duplication of efforts. It also encouraged all ICAO Contracting States to further support the Secretariat in its efforts to provide capacity building assistance based on USAP audit results, subject to the consent of the State(s) receiving assistance, focusing on air cargo and mail where it has been identified as a priority; and urged other entities within the air cargo environment to continue taking action to effectively secure those sections of the supply chain in which they operate.",

The danger and risk were compounded by the fact that such persons usually have access to sterile lounges and other security-restricted areas where they have the opportunity to mingle with passengers and therefore could well interfere with their carry-on baggage and/or the checked baggage already inspected. They also have access to aircraft during ground and pre-flight services. One participating State suggested that in all access control points, conditions should be created securing that 100 % of persons who are not passengers, as well as the articles transported, are subject to security inspections with whatever of the different means available for this purpose, including manual inspection.",

One view was that aviation security has to be sustained in a balanced manner so that, on the one hand, applying security measures to mitigate identified threats, and on the other hand, the essential task of facilitating operations, passengers\u2019 experience and trade could be ensured. Security should not accumulate layer upon layer of controls and associated costs, but should rather ensure the sustainability of the system from the perspectives of cost, efficiency, and acceptability by passengers and air transport operators, which should be a central consideration when designing security processes. Another means of achieving sustainability is at transfer points where security controls are known to have been performed effectively at the point of origin. The Conference took note of the fact that, in such instances, the concept of \u201cOne Stop Security\u201d should be advanced, where ICAO Member States, by virtue of recognising the equivalence of each other\u2019s aviation security regimes, can allow incoming passengers, baggage and cargo to transfer onto a connecting flight without being subjected, once again, to the same security controls as at the point of origin.

Those who belong to a security culture also know which conduct would compromise security and they are quick to educate and caution those who, out of ignorance, forgetfulness, or personal weakness, partake in insecure conduct. This security consciousness becomes a \u201cculture\u201d when all the 191 member States of ICAO as a whole make security violations socially and morally unacceptable within the group. In building a security culture within ICAO member States it is imperative that consideration should also be given to the development of a process for ensuring that all Member States are notified when deficiencies identified during the course of an ICAO security audit conducted under the Universal Security Audit Programme (USAP) remain unaddressed for a sustained period of time. A notification process could involve the use of information which does not divulge specific vulnerabilities but enables States to initiate consultations with the State of interest to ensure the continued protection of aviation assets on a bilateral basis. States have to adopt a security culture that admits of an overall approach to the threat as a potential harm to humanity.

The Strasbourg Agreement was opened for signature by the member States of the Council of Europe on 26 October 1973. This agreement was designed to adapt the provisions of the Berlin Agreement concerning the conveyance of corpses, to the new situation arising from developments in the field of communications systems, international relations and commercial and tourist activities. A proposal to examine anew the problem of the transfer of corpses with a view to drawing up a new instrument was approved by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1967 and this task was entrusted to the European Public Health Committee which, in the course of its work, gave due consideration to the observations, among others, of the European Federation of Funeral Directors (Brussels) and the European Funeral Directors Association (Vienna). The text of the draft Agreement was submitted to the European Committee on Legal Co-operation (CCJ) before its final adoption by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in April 1973. It was opened for signature by member States of the Council of Europe on 26 October 1973.",

The second principle should be that the principles of ICAO Circular 285\u2014AN/166 should be incorporated into Annex 9 along with a Standard in 10.1007/978-3-319-00068-8_4 that human remains should be accorded priority and dignity and that specially reduced rates should be promulgated by States on their airlines for this purpose. This Standard should be adopted in accordance with the basic philosophy of Article 44 (d) of the Chicago Convention which states that ICAO should strive to meet the needs of the people of the world for safe, regular, efficient and economical air transport.",
