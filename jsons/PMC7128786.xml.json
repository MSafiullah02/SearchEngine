HAP and lower respiratory tract infections were shown to be the most common hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), constituting a proportion of 26% [1], [2]. Almost two thirds of HAPs are nvHAPs [1], [2]. Although nvHAP is more frequent, and has been shown to be comparable in mortality and costs to VAP [3], current research, prevention guidelines, and prevention efforts focus almost exclusively on VAP. In 2017, Ewan et al. called nvHAP a \u2018neglected disease\u2019 among HAIs [4]. As a fundamental first step to preventing nvHAP, they argued for obtaining accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence through prospective surveillance [4].",

Three authors reported nvHAP incidence rates between 0.12 and 2.28 per 1000 patient days by applying the 2013 CDC surveillance definition to patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) codes for pneumonia not present on admission [8], [9], [10].

Pneumonia is defined as hospital-acquired when symptoms start \u226548 h after admission. If an invasive respiratory device was present in the 48 h preceding symptom onset, the pneumonia is considered a VAP. For this study, we categorized aetiology in three groups according to microbiological sampling site: first, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or upper respiratory tract specimen; second, bronchoalveolar lavage, endobronchial aspirate, or tissue sample; and third, blood culture or antigen detection in blood or urine. We defined \u2018good-quality sputum and tracheal aspirate\u2019 as sputum or tracheal aspirate with <10 squamous epithelial cells (SECs) per low power field (LPF) in microscopic examination [13]. \u2018Possible fungal pneumonia\u2019 was defined when host factors and clinical criteria were met [14]. \u2018Place of acquisition\u2019 was determined as affiliation to department and ward 48 h before the first symptoms of nvHAP, unless a shorter incubation period was evident from patient history.",

We applied an automated classification algorithm (Fig. 1\n) [5] to distinguish patients \u2018not at risk\u2019 from those \u2018at risk\u2019 for nvHAP. Based on the ECDC case definition, patients were defined as \u2018at risk\u2019 if they had undergone at least one radiological procedure (x-ray or CT scan) of the chest fulfilling the following criteria: (a) radiological procedure performed \u226548 h after admission or at any time during hospitalization for patients readmitted within 28 days; (b) systemic symptoms in temporal relationship to radiological procedure; (c) pneumonia not a-priori excluded in the radiologists' report; (d) no invasive respiratory device constantly present during 48 h preceding radiological procedure. As microbiological criteria are not required for the ECDC nvHAP definition, we refrained from including microbiological criteria in the classification algorithm. The \u2018at-risk\u2019 patients were then manually screened for nvHAP, strictly applying the ECDC case definition [12]. Manual surveillance was performed by two skilled nurses of the IPC team (AM, MF) and double-checked by an experienced infectious disease physician (AW).

We aimed to address this limitation by conducting full manual surveillance on three different validation populations, including a validation sample comprising all patients with HAP according to ICD-10 coding data. Second, even careful manual case evaluation is associated with an inherent risk for interrater variability. We addressed this issue by double-checking all borderline cases and all cases with nvHAP by a second observer. Third, both semi-automated and full manual surveillance rely on radiological procedures demonstrating a pneumonic infiltrate. Patients without x-ray (e.g. due to restrictively performed diagnostic procedures) are missed by both surveillance systems, and so are patients who were transferred to another hospital or discharged home. Fourth, due to our selected algorithm criteria, patients with delayed radiological procedure and patients whose pneumonia was diagnosed in a radiological procedure of the abdomen or in a PET scan can be omitted, as shown by our root-cause analysis. Lastly, our surveillance system may require modification before it is apt for implementation in hospitals with differing characteristics of EMRs and data warehouses. Adaptations would also be needed when CDC instead of ECDC nvHAP definitions are to be used, as CDC definitions include special diagnostic criteria for immunocompromised and elderly patients.",
