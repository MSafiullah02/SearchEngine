This nascent program has evolved, perhaps more significantly than any other research area since its establishment. In addition to the aforementioned gap in the DoD clinical centers, the decision to add this new research area was based on other strategic needs. The military's focus on agents that threaten national security or military personnel on the battlefield may be different than civilian preparedness response efforts for bioterrorism or pandemics. This research area helped align the program with key DoD and non-DoD stakeholders to enhance the IDCRP's ability to respond to new or re-emerging threats and support military clinical capabilities to study biodefense countermeasures.",

            "text": "Agents causing viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, have been targets of vaccine and therapeutics development in the DoD. Viral hemorrhagic fevers have threatened combat, peacekeeping, and training operations for decades in areas such as the Balkans (Dobrava virus), Korea (Hantaan virus) and the South Pacific (dengue virus) and, as a result, have motivated the development of preventive measures. Consequently, the first study in the BD/EID Program area was a collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center and military investigators on the safety and immunogenicity of Ebola and Marburg DNA vaccines, assessed at a WRAIR collaborative field site at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. The results showed that, given separately or together, both investigational DNA vaccines, one encoding Ebola virus Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins and one encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein, were well-tolerated and elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. 3 These findings contributed to the accelerated development of more potent Ebola virus vaccines that encode the same wildtype glycoprotein antigens that were tested during the 2013-16 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. 4, 5 In 2014, the largest-ever Ebola virus outbreak was recognized in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The DoD responded with providing military members to build Ebola treatment units, provide logistics support, and diagnostics teams and assays in-country under Operation United Assistance. 6 Multiple different investigational countermeasures were employed during the outbreak and NIAID led a multi-center group to prioritize the potential countermeasures and develop a randomized controlled trial to study the most promising options. IDCRP investigators participated in the prioritization effort and the IDCRP's team at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center served as the only DoD site participating in the protocol: a randomized controlled trial of the monoclonal antibody ZMapp for treatment of Ebola virus disease. The study enrolled 72 patients and demonstrated improved outcomes from Ebola virus disease in those receiving ZMapp, although the results did not meet pre-specified criteria for statistical significance. 7",

            "text": "As a naturally occurring infection, smallpox was the target of a successful global eradication campaign in the 1950s and vaccination of civilian populations ceased in the 1970s. Nevertheless, because of ongoing concerns of bioterrorism, the U.S. military continues to vaccinate at-risk operational forces, some healthcare workers, and service members in Korea. 8 During the last decade, over one million individuals received the vaccine, which is made from the Vaccinia virus. In addition to conferring protection against smallpox, the Vaccinia virus demonstrated promise as a vaccine-delivery system, inducing immunity to pathogens such as HIV. As a result, another early study assessed host immune factors that might attenuate the response to vaccinations. Because of its potential use in HIV candidate vaccines, investigators at the IDCRP and the Military HIV Research Program, with support from the U.S. Military Vaccine Agency, evaluated the potential impact of pre-existing immunity to Vaccinia with the use of Vaccinia-vectored vaccines in a cell-based infection model. Using longitudinal sera from military personnel who had been vaccinated, the investigators found that serum antibody responses to smallpox vaccination did not persist over extended periods of time (e.g., 5 years post-vaccination), suggesting that prior vaccination for smallpox might not interfere with the effectiveness of novel vaccines using Vaccinia virus as a vector. 9",

Given limitations on the availability of laboratory testing, U.S. (and DoD) policy precludes testing of asymptomatic men for diagnosis of ZIKV infection. To date, there have been 175 confirmed ZIKV cases in the MHS, primarily in deployers and travelers to Puerto Rico and South America. 18 Following the ZIKV outbreaks, there was a recognized need for establishing means for conducting active surveillance of ZIKV (and related arboviruses, such as dengue and chikungunya) among MHS beneficiaries in a disease-endemic location to better prepare for any subsequent re-emergence of these diseases. To this end, the EIDAR team, in collaboration with the WRAIR Viral Diseases Branch, developed a prospective protocol to conduct surveillance of ZIKV and related arboviral infections among active-duty service members and their dependents presenting with symptoms at the Rodriguez Army Health Clinic in Puerto Rico. This study will allow early detection of outbreaks among MHS beneficiaries on the island, assessment of impact on military readiness, and ready reporting to Force Health Protection officials.",

The impact on military medical readiness of diarrheal illness (travelers' diarrhea) encountered during overseas deployments is a well-characterized Force Health Protection issue and is a major focus for prevention and treatment research within the IDCRP Deployment and Travel-Related Infection Research Area. [21] [22] [23] In contrast, less is known about the deleterious health consequences associated with outbreaks of enteric diseases among military populations at installations within the continental United States. Moreover, mounting evidence reported in the literature, primarily from epidemiological studies among civilian populations impacted by diarrheal disease outbreaks, suggests post-infectious sequelae (medical complications observed following infection) is a growing concern. 24-26 Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, a major cause of foodborne illness in the United States and associated with consuming undercooked beef, is linked to life-threatening complications manifesting in the acute phase of infection as severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome, as well as lesser known sequelae emerging months to years later. 27 In response to the U.S. military's largest outbreak of STEC (nearly 300 cases) which occurred at the U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot-San Diego in the Fall of 2017, a new EIDAR protocol was developed to investigate long-term health impact of STEC infection through a 5-year follow-up online surveybased study assessing clinical outcomes. The overall objective is to determine the incidence of post-infectious sequelae, including functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, constipation), osteoarticular symptoms (reactive arthritis and avascular necrosis), and renovascular disease (hypertension and chronic kidney disease) in Marines identified as STEC cases during the outbreak relative to nonill matched controls. A series of analytic modeling approaches will be used to develop a risk model health outcomes risk score to determine how comorbidities, demographics, and other factors affect risk for developing post-infectious sequelae. This health outcomes risk score could be a Force Health Protection tool for identifying individuals at greatest risk for long-term complications in military populations affected by future diarrheal illness outbreaks.",

            "text": "The IDCRP has had a long interest in studying antimicrobial resistance in several of its research areas. As a result, EIDAR research on MDROs and infections caused by these organisms overlap with several other IDCRP research areas, including Trauma-Related Infections, Deployment and Travel-Related Infections, and Sexually Transmitted Infections Research Areas. 11, 13, 23 In alignment with the President's launch of the 2014 Executive Order for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, EIDAR efforts address Force Health Protection concerns associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and filling clinical knowledge gaps related to best practices for antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) within the MHS. One such major effort is the Trauma Infectious Disease Outcomes Study (TIDOS) Multidrug-Resistant and other Virulent Organisms (MDR/VO) Trauma Infections Initiative, which is a collaborative effort across DoD laboratories with expertise in wound microbiology and infections (including USU, Brooke Army Medical Center, U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, WRAIR, and NMRC). 11 The MDR/VO Trauma Infections Initiative was established to investigate the combat trauma wound microbiology and infections linked to well-characterized clinical data and outcomes to expand our understanding of the complex microbiology inherent within combat wounds. Through the TIDOS MDR/VO Initiative, several analyses have been performed to examine microorganisms collected from combat casualties from Iraq and Afghanistan, assess antimicrobial resistance, and evaluate associations with clinical outcomes. 11 Patients colonized or infected with pathogens having in vitro resistance are reported to have more co-morbidities, longer hospital stays prior to infection, and increased exposure to antibiotics. 38 Each of these factors can independently influence clinical outcomes regardless of in vitro susceptibilities. Therefore, understanding patient comorbidities is important when assessing the impact of in vitro resistance on outcomes, along with the development and prevention of infection. Comorbidities may differ in a military population compared to the general public, especially in combat-related trauma patients and, thus, may affect outcomes differently in this population. 39 The impact of in vitro resistance in a military population has not been evaluated. To address this clinical knowledge gap, an EIDAR retrospective study is investigating association between phenotypic in vitro bacterial resistance, patient comorbidities and outcomes in antimicrobial-resistant bloodstream infections (AR-BSIs) in adult DoD beneficiaries, utilizing data extracted from the MHS Data Repository. Analyses are underway of microbiology and clinical data from~7,500 cases to describe the demographics and risk factors of MHS patients who develop AR-BSIs. Results from this study will help direct MHS resources to more effectively prevent and plan care for these patients.",
