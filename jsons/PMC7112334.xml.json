            "text": "Historically, vaccines have been one of the most cost\u2010effective and easily administered means of controlling infectious diseases in humans and animals. Vaccine development has its roots in the work of Edward Jenner (1749\u20131823) who discovered that man could be protected from smallpox by inoculation with cowpox (Fenner, 2000) and the work of Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895) who developed the first rabies vaccine (Fu, 1997). These pioneering efforts led to vaccines against diseases that had once claimed millions of lives worldwide (Andre, 2003). Childhood vaccination programs are now common practice and elaborate vaccination programs have been set up by the World Health Organization (WHO), leading to the official eradication of smallpox in 1979 (Fenner, 2000). Today large parts of the world are also declared poliomyelitis free, and measles is the next target for eradication. Vaccines have controlled major bacterial and viral diseases in humans, and effective vaccines are available against many more (Andre 2003, Hansson 2000b). Vaccination also protects our livestock and pet animals (Pastoret et al., 1997). For some diseases, however, such as malaria and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), vaccines are desparately sought.",

            "text": "Most human and animal vaccines are based on killed or live\u2010attenuated pathogens. Killed vaccines require the production of large amounts of often highly virulent pathogens and these types of vaccines are therefore risky to produce. Another risk lies in the potential for incomplete inactivation of the pathogens. Inactivation on the other hand affects the immunogenic properties of the pathogen, and hence the efficacy as a vaccine, and it is often difficult to find the balance between efficient inactivation and conservation of immunogenicity. Live\u2010attenuated vaccines consist of pathogens that are reduced in virulence or have been attenuated either by growing them in alternative hosts or under unfavorable growing conditions, or by recombinant DNA technology. These live\u2010attenuated vaccines can potentially replicate in their host, but are typically attenuated in their pathogenicity to avoid the development of severe disease. Live vaccines elicit humoral and cellular immunity, and may provide lifelong protection with a single or a few doses (Dertzbaugh 1998, Hansson 2000b, Schijns 2003). Such long\u2010term protection is advantageous in developing countries where individuals are often only immunized once. A drawback of live\u2010attenuated vaccines is that they can cause side effects, which may be dangerous when used for prophylaxis in immunocompromised persons such as the elderly or individuals with genetic or acquired diseases of the immune system (e.g., AIDS or severe combined immunodeficiency; SCID). Live\u2010attenuated vaccines may also convert to virulent strains and spread to nonimmunized persons as observed during recent poliomyelitis outbreaks (Kew et al., 2004). Adverse effects with both killed and live\u2010attenuated vaccines can also be due to allergic reactions to components of the vaccine such as residual egg proteins in the case of influenza vaccines (Kelso and Yunginger, 2003) or gelatin in the measles\u2010mumps\u2010rubella (MMR) vaccine (Patja et al., 2001).",

The vaccine industry is under constant pressure for rapidly changing pathogens, for which large amounts of vaccines are needed annually, such as influenza viruses (Palese, 2004), and flexible vaccine production techniques are required. For several infectious diseases vaccines cannot be developed using conventional approaches, for instance due to a lack of appropriate animal production systems or the high\u2010mutation frequency of the pathogen (Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria). A vaccine against the H5N1 influenza strain that is currently epidemic in Asian poultry could not be produced the classical way, by using embryonized chicken eggs without reducing the virulence of the virus by reverse genetics, due to high\u2010mortality rates of the chicken embryos (Horimoto et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production systems may provide good alternatives for the development of vaccines that are more difficult to produce in vivo for manufacture of so\u2010called subunit vaccines. A pathogen consists of many proteins, frequently with carbohydrate moieties, but these are not all equally important for generation of an adequate immunological response. Subunit vaccines contain the immunodominant components of a pathogen and in the case of viral vaccines these are often (glyco)proteins of the viral coat or envelope such as the hepatitis B surface antigen (Bouma 1999, Valenzuela 1982) or the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) E2 glycoprotein (Bouma 1999, Valenzuela 1982). Viral coat proteins sometimes form virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) when expressed in heterologous systems (Brown et al., 1991), which are often immunogenic and may induce both humoral and cellular responses. The subunit vaccine against hepatitis B produced in yeast is highly succesful. An extreme example of subunit vaccines are peptide\u2010based vaccines which consist of small amino acid chains harboring the part of the antigenic protein that is recognized by antibodies. Typically, subunit vaccines do not contain the genetic material of the pathogen or only a small part thereof. Therefore, these vaccines cannot cause disease and do not introduce pathogens into nonendemic regions. An additional advantage of subunit vaccines is that they can be used in combination with specific marker tests, which make it possible to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals, the so\u2010called DIVA vaccines (Capua 2003, van Oirschot 1999); an important issue in monitoring virus prevalence and virus\u2010free export of animals and their products.",

An alternative is the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce protein subunits in a heterologous system, and a variety of expression systems are available (Clark 2005, Hansson 2000b). The yeast system Saccharomyces cerevisiae for instance is used to produce the hepatitis B subunit vaccine (Valenzuela et al., 1982), which is currently the only licensed recombinant subunit vaccine for human use. The yeast Pichia pastoris is used for production of the antitick vaccine Gavac\u2122 (Canales et al., 1997), which protects cattle against the tick Boophilus microplus, the transmitter of Babesia and Anaplasma parasite species. Insect cells are used to produce vaccines against classical swine fever or hog cholera (Depner 2001, van Aarle 2003). For the production of recombinant proteins in higher eukaryotics, mammalian, insect, and plant expression systems are available that either use trangenes or viral vectors for protein expression. Plants have been recognized for the production of so\u2010called edible subunit vaccines to be administered by ingestion of vegetable foods (Ma 2005, Streatfield 2003).",

The family Baculoviridae contains rod\u2010shaped, invertebrate\u2010infecting viruses, which have large double\u2010stranded, covalently closed circular DNA genomes (Table II\n). The members of this large virus family are taxonomically divided into the genera Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) and Granulovirus (GV), based on occlusion body morphology (Theilmann et al., 2005). NPVs express two genes, polyhedrin and p10, at very high levels in the very late phase of infection. The polyhedrin protein forms the viral occlusion bodies or polyhedra and p10 is present in fibrillar structures, which function in polyhedron morphology and in breakdown of infected cell\u2010nuclei to release the polyhedra (Okano 2006, Van Oers 1997). These two genes are not essential for virus replication in cell culture and, therefore, their promoters are exploited to drive foreign gene expression, which forms the basis for the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system. Since baculoviruses are rod\u2010shaped, large amounts of foreign DNA can be accommodated within the virus particle, in contrast to vaccinia and especially adenovirus expression vectors (Table II).",

This baculovirus is routinely used for foreign gene expression. The baculovirus Bombyx mori NPV is being used for vaccine purposes to a much lesser extent (Choi 2000, Mori 1994). Baculovirus expression vectors replicate in cultured insect cells or larvae and high yields of heterologous protein are generally obtained when the strong viral polyhedrin and p10 promoters are exploited (King 1992, O'Reilly 1992). The insect cell lines used in the baculovirus expression system are derived from lepidopteran insects (moths) and are most often Spodoptera frugiperda lines (Sf9 or Sf21) and Trichoplusia ni (High Five\u2122) cells, which can be used in combination with AcMNPV\u2010based vectors. B. mori cells (e.g., Bm5) are used for BmNPV. Insect cell lines vary in their characteristics in terms of growth rate, protein production, secretion efficiency and glycosylation pattern, and interference with viral genome stability (Pijlman 2003b, Vlak 1996). These insect cells are relatively easy to maintain and many grow equally well in suspension in large volumes (up to 2000 L reactions) and at high densities as on solid supports, and can be cultivated in serum\u2010free media which facilitates purification of recombinant proteins. Unlike mammalian cells, they do not require CO2 and can easily withstand temperature fluctuations. An extra advantage is that the chance of contamination with human or mammalian viruses, especially in serum\u2010free cultures, is small compared to mammalian production systems because these vertebrate viruses do not replicate in lepidopteran cells. These cells do not support the growth of mammalian mycoplasmas either. Instead of insect cells, whole insect larvae may be used as live bioreactors for vaccine production. The use of whole insect larvae has the advantage that the simple insect\u2010rearing technology and downstream processing can be exploited. Such in vivo production could be performed by small\u2010scale local industries, especially if the larvae can be fed directly to animals such as for an experimental Newcastle disease vaccine for chickens (Mori et al., 1994). Such vaccines are less well defined however and quality control may therefore be more difficult to achieve.",

Protein glycosylation in insects and mammals is not identical though: the N\u2010glycan\u2013processing pathway in insects results in glycoproteins with paucimannose glycan groups, in contrast to mammalian glycoproteins which contain complex sialylated glycans (see also Harrison, this volume, pp. 159\u2013191). The exact glycan composition varies between different insect cell lines (Kost 2005, Tomiya 2004). In general, glycan groups are not very immunogenic and therefore this does not seem to be a major disadvantage for subunit vaccines. In situations where more authentic glycosylation is required, for instance for preserving functional activity, transformed \u201chumanized\u201d insect cell lines expressing mammalian glycosylation enzymes are available (Jarvis 2003, Kost 2005, Tomiya 2004). For some insect cell lines it has been reported that fucose groups are added to N\u2010glycans. The impact of this remains to be determined, but since fucans may cause allergic reactions, it may be a point for consideration when choosing an insect cell line for vaccine production (Long 2006, Tomiya 2004).",

In a similar way, baculovirus vectors have since been developed which exploit the nonessential very late baculovirus p10 promoter (Vlak 1990, Weyer 1991). Vectors that leave the polyhedrin gene intact can be used for the production of recombinant proteins in insect larvae (Fig. 1\n). The in vivo recombination protocol was improved by using linearized viral DNA in the allelic replacement, which resulted in dominant selection and much higher percentages of recombinant viruses (Kitts 1990, Martens 1995). In vectors of this type (BacPAK\u2122 vectors, BaculoGold\u2122, Bac\u2010N\u2010Blue\u2122) the linearized viral DNA carries a lethal deletion (ORF1609) and becomes replication competent only after recombination with a transfer plasmid carrying the foreign gene, thereby restoring the deletion (Kitts and Possee, 1993). Baculovirus vectors based on Gateway technology (BaculoDirect\u2122) are linear baculovirus vectors in which foreign genes are introduced through site\u2010specific in vitro recombination.",

In this system (Bac\u2010to\u2010Bac\u2122) recombinant baculovirus genomes are generated in Escherichia coli and then used to transfect insect cells to obtain recombinant baculovirus particles. After generating high\u2010titer virus stocks, insect cells are infected to produce recombinant proteins. With the bacmid\u2010based methodology the time to generate recombinant viruses is reduced considerably. Another advantage is that the recombinant bacmid can be stored in E. coli and recovered when needed. A disadvantage is that the bacterial gene cassette present in bacmid\u2010derived viruses may easily be lost during virus passaging (Pijlman et al., 2003a). In addition to AcMNPV, bacmids have also been constructed for Spodoptera exigua MNPV and Helicoverpa armigera SNPV (Pijlman 2002, Wang 2003). The most recent method combines bacmid technologies with allelic replacement (FlashBac\u2122; Oxford Expression Technologies) and thereby removes the BAC sequences from the viral genome. This latter system is especially suitable for high\u2010throughput screening.",

Transfer vectors with dual, triple, or quadruple promoters usually p10 and polyhedrin, have been developed for allelic replacement (Belyaev 1993, Weyer 1991); dual (pFastBacDual\u2122) and quadruple vectors (Tareilus et al., 2003) have also been developed for bacmid technology. Such multiple vectors can be used to express various proteins simultaneously, and hence are useful for producing multimeric complexes, including viral capsids consisting of more than one viral protein (Belyaev and Roy, 1993). Balancing expression levels is sometimes a problem in these vectors and may require coinfection with a vector expressing only the dominant protein, or a modification of the promoters. One of the promoters in multiple promoter vectors may be used to express a reporter gene, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), which makes it easy to follow the infection process in cells, perform virus titrations, and track baculovirus infection in the insect (Cha 1997, Kaba 2003). The recently developed vector system (UltraBac) uses the baculovirus late basic protein (P6.9) promoter to express GFP together with the foreign gene to allow earlier monitoring of infection (Philipps et al., 2005).",

The abundant baculovirus protein chitinase is also transported to the ER and accumulates there due to a KDEL retention sequence (Saville 2004, Thomas 1998). Chitinase is expressed in the late phase of baculovirus infection and is involved in the dissolution of the insect chitinous cuticle to enhance the spread of viral occlusion bodies (Hawtin et al., 1997). Deletion of chitinase from the baculovirus vector resulted in higher levels of secreted recombinant protein (Possee et al., 1999) possibly because chitinase \u201ccloggs up\u201d the protein translocation machinery and competes with recombinant secretory proteins. The FlashBac system described earlier lacks this chitinase gene. Another baculovirus protein, v\u2010cathepsin also accumulates in the ER and is activated on cell death by proteolytic cleavage (Hom et al., 2002). Processing of pro\u2010v\u2010cathepsin into active cathepsin is also triggered by chaotropic agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, and this may result in proteolysis of recombinant proteins during extraction and purification (Hom and Volkman, 1998). A bacmid vector that lacked both chitinase and v\u2010cathepsin (AcBac\u0394CC) improved the stability of a secreted recombinant protein, thereby increasing the yield of full\u2010length protein molecules (Kaba et al., 2004a).",

The foldase ERp57 did not have this effect (Tate et al., 1999). Calreticulin and calnexin were also shown to increase the level of active lipoprotein lipase when coexpressed in insect cells, and to stimulate dimerization of the recombinant protein (Zhang et al., 2003). Expression of calnexin and calreticulin in a stable transgenic insect cell line, which was than infected with a recombinant baculovirus, resulted in a lower ratio of secreted versus intracellular recombinant protein than when cells were coinfected with two baculoviruses, one carrying the gene of interest and the other a chaperone (Kato et al., 2005). This result suggests that chaperone expression levels should be of the same order as recombinant protein levels.",

Baculovirus vectors with mammalian promoters (BacMam\u2122 viruses) have the potential to serve as gene delivery vectors in gene therapy (Huser 2003, Kost 2002) and have also been tested for vaccination purposes (Abe 2003, Aoki 1999, Facciabene 2004, Poomputsa 2003). In this case, a mammalian promoter or a viral promoter active in mammalian cells, such as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 promoter, drives intracellular expression of the antigen. Exposure on the cell surface via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) activates the cellular immune system and in this respect, these types of vaccines resemble DNA vaccines. BacMam\u2122 vectors are produced in insect cells and are replication incompetent in mammalian cells (Table II). A further advantage is that multiple genes can be inserted simultaneously into the baculovirus genome allowing for multivalent vaccines. Expression of multiple proteins is an advantage of the baculovirus expression system over other systems, especially adenovirus vectors, where the maximal increase in genome size is more limited due to packaging restrictions.",

Baculovirus\u2013insect cell systems have been scaled\u2010up to large\u2010scale cultures in either fermentors (bioreactors) or cellbag devices (WAVE reactors). Insect cell bioreactors up to 2000 L have been reported. The bioprocess technology behind this large scale production has been reviewed by others (Hunt 2005, Ikonomou 2003, Vlak 1996). A problem repeatedly encountered when expressing recombinant proteins with baculovirus vectors is a drop in expression levels with increasing virus passage (reviewed in Krell, 1996). This so\u2010called \u201cpassage effect\u201d is intrinsic to baculovirus replication in cell culture, but is less critical for small laboratory\u2010scale protein production when the number of virus passages is low (<10). It is a significant problem though for large\u2010scale industrial production of vaccines in insect cell bioreactors (Van Lier et al., 1996) and prevents the use of continous bioreactors. The major causes of loss of recombinant protein expression are (1) mutations in the FP25K gene, reducing the activity of the polyhedrin promoter (Harrison et al., 1996), (2) the generation of defective interfering particles (DIs) which replicate at the expense of the full\u2010length recombinant virus (Kool 1991, Pijlman 2001, Wickham 1991), (3) the intracellular accumulation of concatenated viral sequences, for example, non\u2010hr (homologous repeat) origins of DNA replication) which interfere with replication of full\u2010length genomes (Lee 1994, Pijlman 2002), and (4) spontaneous deletion of the heterologous gene from the baculovirus vector. The latter aspect is especially seen in bacmid\u2010derived vectors, which are extremely sensitive to spontaneous removal of the expression cassette, a large piece of DNA which is not under selection (Pijlman et al., 2003a). To prevent the amplification of DIs, baculovirus vectors must be used at low multiplicities of infection (MOI) (de Gooijer 1992, Wickham 1991) and it is now common practice to keep the number of viral passages to a minimum and establish low\u2010passage virus banks as seed stocks for production purposes.",

The accumulation of non\u2010hr\u2013containing sequences can easily be prevented by removing this sequence from the baculovirus backbone (Pijlman et al., 2002). Reducing the distance between origins of replication in the bacmid system by insertion of an extra hr sequence within the expression cassette also resulted in prolonged foreign gene expression in a test bioreactor (Pijlman et al., 2004). In the FlashBac system, all destabilizing bacterially derived sequences are removed on recombination with the transfer vector. To prevent loss of the foreign gene cassette, a bicistronic vector was developed that contained the foreign gene and the baculovirus essential gene GP64 on a single bicistronic transcriptional unit linked by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). GP64 was deleted from its original locus. In this bicistronic vector, loss of the foreign gene would automatically result in loss of expression of the essential gene, which is needed for the generation of complete virus particles as well as for DIs. GFP expression levels were kept at a high level for at least 20 passages with this vector providing dominant selection for GP64 (Pijlman et al., 2006). This system awaits testing for expression of proteins of medical importance. By combining several of the methods described in this section, it is likely that genome stability will be further improved.",

The expressed envelope proteins are often functionally active and have been reported to oligomerize, an indication that they are correctly folded (Crawford et al., 1999). Commonly, viral envelope glycoproteins are glycosylated in insect cells. Examples of baculovirus\u2010produced subunit vaccine candidates (Table III) are the fusion proteins and hemagglutinins of paramyxoviruses, such as Newcastle disease virus, and the E proteins of Flaviviridae, including West Nile virus, dengue viruses, and CSFV. Two commercially available veterinary subunit vaccines against classical swine fever (BAYOVAC CSF E2\u2122 and PORCILIS PESTI\u2122) are based on the CSFV E2 glycoprotein produced in insect cells (Ahrens 2000, Bouma 1999, Bouma 2000, Depner 2001, van Aarle 2003). The E2 envelope glycoprotein of CSFV was expressed as a secreted protein by removing the TMR and this resulted in a threefold increase in expression levels, and allowed for purification of E2 from the culture medium (Hulst et al., 1993). In a similar way, the related Bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) E2 protein was expressed in insect cells (Bolin and Ridpath, 1996). Recent research showed that the BVDV E2 protein needs to be glycosylated to be effectively secreted from baculovirus\u2010infected cells (Pande et al., 2005) and that the glycosylated protein was able to block BVDV infection better in an in vitro assay. Whether the glycosylated E2 protein also performs better as a vaccine is not known. The spike glycoprotein of the SARS coronavirus is one of the most recently expressed proteins in insect cells and protected mice against intranasal SARS infection (Bisht et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Influenza presents a serious risk for both human and animal health. The single\u2010stranded RNA of the influenza virus changes quickly through an accumulation of mutations and frequent recombination events, requiring annual vaccine updates (Palese, 2004). The most threatening recent example is the outbreak of avian influenza of the H5N1 serotype which has killed birds and humans in the Far East since 2003 (WHO) and which caused the first human casualties outside this area in East Turkey in January 2006. The big fear is that such an avian virus will change into a virus that can be transmitted directly from man to man, which may then lead to an influenza outbreak of pandemic dimensions (Palese, 2004). The most widely used influenza vaccines, e g., Fluzone (Sanofi Pasteur) and Fluvirin (Chiron), consist of chemically inactivated split virus or purified virus subunits. These vaccines have several disadvantages which have recently been reviewed (Cox 2005, Cox 2004), including reduced efficacy in the elderly, where vaccination does reduce mortality rates but is not very effective in preventing disease. In addition, an enormous number of eggs are needed each year (one egg per dose) which will very likely lead to a shortage of vaccine in the event of a pandemic; some strains grow poorly in eggs requiring coinfections with other strains or genetic adaptations (e.g., H5N1) (Horimoto et al., 2006); and these vaccines can cause strong allergic reactions in some individuals. Live, attenuated influenza vaccines have the advantage of inducing secretory and systemic immunity and are applied intranasally, preventing virus replication in the respiratory tracts (Cox et al., 2004). However, all of these vaccines still need to be grown in chicken embryos, which are ironically also the target for a potentially pandemic virus like H5N1.",

            "text": "To overcome these drawbacks, various cell\u2010based vaccines for influenza are under development as well as recombinant protein vaccines. Clinical trials of vaccines based on influenza virus produced in mammalian cell cultures, such as Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, have been described (Brands 1999, Percheson 1999) and trials with influenza vaccines produced in the human retina cell line Per.C6\u00ae (Pau et al., 2001) are ongoing. These products still require inactivation of the influenza virus which may reduce immunogenicity as seen for inactivated vaccines. In response to human casualties of H5 and H7 influenza viruses in Asia in the late 1990s, the immunogenicity and safety of baculovirus recombinant H5 and H7 hemagglutinin (HA) proteins was tested in chickens and resulted in 100% protection against disease symptoms (Crawford et al., 1999). The immunogenicity of the baculovirus\u2010derived H5 vaccine was subsequently evaluated in over 200 healthy human adults. The vaccine was well tolerated and provided neutralizing antibody responses equivalent to those observed in convalescent sera in \u223c50% of the individuals after two doses (Treanor et al., 2001). A clinical trial with baculovirus\u2010produced recombinant H3 antigens in 127 adult volunteers showed protective neutralizing antibody levels and a reduction in influenza rates in the following epidemic season compared to a placebo group (Powers et al., 1995). This HA\u2010based vaccine induced both B and T memory cells (Powers et al., 1997). A clinical study of 399 individuals with an average age of 70 years was completed in 2003\u20132004 with an experimental vaccine (FluBl\u00d8k, Protein Sciences corporation) containing the same three HA antigen variants as present in the licensed inactivated vaccine of that flu season (Treanor et al., 2006). Compared to the licensed vaccine, the recombinant vaccine produced higher antibody titers against the H3 strain, the strain responsible for the majority of influenza deaths each year (Cox, 2005). This result suggests that this vaccine can be especially useful for reduction of the annual number of influenza\u2010related deaths in the elderly, where H3 antibody titers induced by conventional vaccines are too low to be protective. Phase III trials in healthy adults have been completed and showed a 100% protective effcicacy even against H3N2 influenza viruses (Manon Cox, personal communication) (http://www.proteinsciences.com/, Jan 2006). Preparation of a recombinant influenza virus vaccine cocktail for the coming flu season may take about 3 months to complete from the moment the new vaccine composition is announced by the World Health Organization (WHO).",

A baculovirus recombinant vaccine with both HA and neuraminidase (NA) subunits resulted in a bivalent seroconversion with antibodies against both HA and NA (Johansson, 1999). The efficacy of an H3N2 vaccine based on both HA and NA produced with a recombinant baculovirus was analyzed in a murine model and compared with a conventional killed and a live\u2010attenuated vaccine preparation and an HA single\u2010subunit vaccine (Brett and Johansson, 2005). The NA in the baculovirus\u2010derived vaccine was much more immunogenic than in the conventional vaccines. The advantage of inducing an immune response to both surface proteins is illustrated by the fact that the recombinant vaccine containing both HA and NA did not only prevent infection with homotypic and closely related viruses, but also showed a strong reduction in pulmonary virus titers in infections with a more distantly related virus (H3N2 A/Panama/2007/99 versus A/Fuijan/411/2002), in contrast to a vaccine based on HA only. These results suggest that a vaccine containing intact NA tolerates more antigenic drift, thereby reducing the chance of virus escaping the immune system during the flu season.",

The advantage of VLPs is that they resemble the natural virus but are not infectious because they lack genetic material. VLPs are also an excellent tool for study of virus structure. VLPs can easily be purified by extraction, centrifugation, or precipitation (Brown et al., 1991) and often give strong immune reactions even in the absence of adjuvants due to their particulate nature. In addition, humoral, cell\u2010mediated, and mucosal immune responses have been reported (Roy, 1996). An example of a vaccine consisting of recombinant VLPs produced with a baculovirus vector is a patented Canine parvovirus vaccine (Lopez de Turiso 1992, Valdes 1999). Sometimes the expression of more than one viral coat protein is needed to make immunogenic VLPs, either due to the complexity of the capsid structure (Bluetongue virus: BTV, Reoviridae) or presence of crucial epitopes on several coat proteins. Multicomponent VLPs can be produced by using vectors with multiple promoters or by coinfections with several baculovirus vectors that each encode one or more viral proteins. One difficulty in making complex VLPs is to achieve appropriate expression levels of each protein present in the viral capsid.",

Infectious bursal disease (IBDV, Birnaviridae) of birds can also be prevented by vaccination with single component VLPs (Martinez\u2010Torrecuadrada 2003, Wang 2000). The major capsid protein L1 of Papovaviridae forms VLPs and has been shown to protect cottontail rabbits against Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus. Combinations of the HPV\u201016 L1 and L2 capsid proteins and the oncogenic protein E7 protected against tumor formation in a mouse model (Greenstone et al., 1998). Multivalent VLP preparations containing BTV (Reoviridae) VP2 subunits of various serotypes were made by coinfections of several baculovirus vectors and induced long\u2010lasting protection in sheep (Roy et al., 1994).

            "text": "The rationale for using VLPs as vaccine candidates is obvious for nonenveloped viruses, because in these viruses the capsid proteins are directly exposed to the immune system. However, they may also be useful for displaying epitopes of enveloped viruses. HIV is an enveloped virus and in this case VLPs have been produced based on gp55 (gag) to which immunogenic segments of the envelope protein gp120 were coupled (Arico 2005, Buonaguro 2002, Tobin 1997). An extension of these chimeric VLP\u2010based vaccines is to use VLPs of one virus to display epitopes of heterologous proteins that do not form VLPs by themselves. Examples of such systems are Human parvovirus B19 VLPs which carry linear epitopes in fusion with the viral VP2 protein. This system was used to display epitopes of Murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV; Coronaviridae) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV; Herpesviridae) (Brown et al., 1994). Such chimeric VLPs protected mice against a lethal challenge with MHV of HSV. Epitope\u2010presenting chimeric VLPs have also been developed based on Mouse papillomavirus (Tegerstedt et al., 2005) and Flock house virus VLPs (Scodeller et al., 1995).",

Adjuvant possibilities for human application are very limited because of safety considerations and this may limit the application of monomeric subunit vaccines in humans. VLPs on the other hand have been shown to induce protection even without the addition of adjuvants (Li 2004, Roy 1996). An alternative way to modulate the immune response is by the addition of recombinant cytokines as vaccine adjuvants. Cytokines can either be added separately to the vaccine or may be included in VLPs. This approach may not only modulate the magnitude but also the type of immune response (Lofthouse et al., 1996). By carefully choosing which cytokine is added the immune response can be driven in a certain direction. Interferon gamma (IFN\u2010\u03b3) may be added to stimulate macrophages, while addition of interleukin\u201012 (IL\u201012) promotes cell\u2010mediated adaptive immunity (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005). IL\u201012 can be efficiently produced with baculovirus vectors as functional dimers that shift the immunogenic balance to Th1 cells in bovine calves (Takehara et al., 2002). IL\u201012 added to influenza VLPs enhances antibody responses but in this case VLPs alone already result in 100% protection (Galarza et al., 2005a). Immune reactions to helminths involve Th2 responses. Interleukin\u20104 (IL\u20104) drives the immune response to differentiation of Th2 cells and to the production of heminth\u2010specific IgE antibodies (Abbas and Lichtman, 2005). Addition of IL\u20104 may therefore be helpful for vaccines against helminths (Lofthouse et al., 1996). For baculovirus\u2010derived products the addition of cytokines has not been fully exploited, but it is commonly used for DNA vaccines. The addition of costimulators, such as B7 or CD40, to baculovirus\u2010produced vaccines has not been reported.",

A candidate Pseudorabies virus vaccine expressing its glycoprotein B from a recombinant baculovirus vector with a mammalian promoter resulted in seroconversion in immunized mice (Aoki et al., 1999). Intramuscular injection with baculovirus BVs expressing the E2 glycoprotein of Hepatitis C virus controlled by the CMV immediate\u2010early promoter\u2010enhancer provided specific humoral and cellular responses (Facciabene et al., 2004). Similar results were obtained with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) indicating that these types of vaccines can also be effective against tumors. The addition of the Vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) G protein to the baculovirus envelope increased immunogenicity in this experiment, possibly by enhancement of virus fusion. BacMam\u2122 vectors have also been used to produce mutated, attenuated influenza virus in mammalian cells by delivery of an altered NS1 gene (Poomputsa et al., 2003). Surprisingly, a baculovirus vector with the influenza hemagglutinin gene (H1) controlled by the chicken beta\u2010actin promoter gave a similar level of protection as a wild\u2010type baculovirus against a lethal influenza challenge in intranasally immunized mice (Abe et al., 2003). The authors ascribe this to the induction of a strong innate immune response by the baculovirus, protecting the mice from a subsequent lethal challenge with influenza virus.",

Pigs for instance have been shown to produce high levels of baculovirus\u2010neutralizing antibodies after injection of baculovirus BVs (Tuboly et al., 1993). A solution to this problem could be to design multivalent vaccines, since baculoviruses can take up a large amount of foreign DNA. Another problem with the use of baculovirus particles as vaccines is rapid degradation by the complement system which also affects gene therapy applications. Pseudotyping of BVs with the VSV glycoprotein instead of GP64 resulted in a reduction in complement inactivation (Tani et al., 2003). Incorporation of human decay\u2010accelerating factor (DAF), a complement\u2010regulatory protein, in the BV envelope has been shown to protect baculovirus gene therapy vectors against complement\u2010mediated inactivation (Huser et al., 2001).

In this case, a capsid protein of an enveloped virus is a reasonable subunit for vaccination because DNA vaccines are expressed intracellularly and fragments of the resulting proteins are presented by MHC complexes to induce cellular immune responses. In this way the natural situation of intracellular expression of viral genes is mimicked. T cell responses, especially the action of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial in defense against HIV. HIV combination vaccines where adenovirus, vaccinia (HIVAC\u20101e), or vesicular stomatitis virus vectors were used for immunization in combination with a boost with a protein subunit (gp160, gp41) have been tested in phase I trials in humans (Cooney 1993, Graham 1993, Lubeck 1994, Luo 2006, Perales 1995, Zheng 1999). Viral carriers also express HIV antigens inside cells, and these antigens are displayed either by specialized APCs or other cells to the immune system.

In cases of outbreaks, ring vaccination is sometimes applied, but large\u2010scale vaccination is generally not allowed. A prerequisite for the broader use of animal vaccines is the development of marker vaccines that enable differentiation between vaccinated and infected animals. This is especially important for endemic diseases in animals where monitoring is of crucial importance to avoid spread of the virus to nonendemic regions or to other host species such as humans or wild animals. Marker vaccines also have good prospects for eradication of animal diseases in general (van Aarle, 2003). For such purposes, marker vaccines do not have to give 100% herd immunity, because reducing susceptibility and transmission can be sufficient to have a major effect in controlling animal disease (Henderson, 2005). Marker vaccines need to be accompanied by specific diagnostic tests that are commonly based on determining serum titers of a viral component that is absent in the vaccine but present in the pathogen, to which antibodies can be raised.",

An enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for serum antibodies against the other immunogenic surface protein ERNS can be used to discriminate immunized animals from virus carriers (Langedijk 2001, van Aarle 2003). Another possibility is to use only some of the epitopes of an antigen for immunization and others for the diagnostic analysis, as demonstrated for CSFV (van Rijn et al., 1999). The coexistence of a subunit vaccine and a discriminative diagnostic test enabled registration of CSFV vaccines in Europe. Marker vaccines will also be very useful for immunization of poultry against avian influenza (Crawford et al., 1999), where monitoring for the presence of virus is essential. Animals immunized with HA or HA/NA vaccines could be screened for antibodies against the viral matrix proteins. Similar assays have been developed for other subunit vaccines, such as one that discriminates between VSV\u2010infected and immunized animals, where the marker vaccine is based on the glycoprotein and the assay on the nucleocapsid protein produced in insect larvae (Ahmad et al., 1993).",

Plasmodium is transmitted in the form of sporozoites by Anopheles mosquitoes. A vaccine candidate based on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is aimed at blocking these sporozoites. Both B and T cell responses appear to be essential for protective immunity based on the CSP protein. CSP has been produced in insect cells but was minimally immunogenic when tested in 20 volunteers (Herrington et al., 1992).

The recombinant Pbs21 antigen produced in insect cells blocked oocyte formation in Anopheles mosquitoes fed on immunized mice (Matsuoka et al., 1996). The immunogenicity of the recombinant protein was strongly reduced when the protein was expressed as a secreted protein by removing its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal (Martinez et al., 2000). This protein provides a good example of loss of immunogenicity by expressing a membrane protein in a secreted form. Subunit vaccines based on the Plasmodium\u2010induced erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (EMP\u20101) are aimed at blocking vertical transmission from mother to child (maternal malaria) via the placenta. This transmission involves the sequestration of P. falciparum\u2010infected erythrocytes through EMP\u20101, which binds to chondroitin sulphate A in the placenta.

Immunization with recombinant sporozoite surface protein p67 is aimed at blocking invasion of lymphocytes by this parasite. P67 is an example of a protein that was not easy to express in a native form in insect cells as well as in many other systems. In insect cells, it was expressed at low levels and in contrast to expectations was not present on the cell surface. Similar to E. coli\u2010expressed p67, it did not react with a monoclonal antibody against native p67, indicating that the folding of the protein was not correct (Nene et al., 1995). Several adaptations were therefore made to the expression system. Expression of p67 coupled to the honeybee mellitin signal instead of the original signal peptide resulted in correct routing of this protein to the cell surface, but the folding was still not optimal (Kaba et al., 2004a). Fusion of p67 to the C terminus of GFP drastically increased expression levels and resulted in recognition by the conformation\u2010sensitive monoclonal antibody (Kaba et al., 2002). A similar effect was also seen when parts of this protein were fused to the baculovirus GP64 glycoprotein in a surface display vector, which led to expression on the cell surface and on baculovirus BVs (Kaba et al., 2003). The recombinant GFP\u2010p67 protein and the C terminal half of p67 coupled to GP64 induced high levels of sporozoite\u2010neutralizing serum antibodies and showed up to 80% protection against lethal T. parva challenge in a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled experiment (Kaba 2004b, Kaba 2005). The next phase will be to evaluate the quality of these experimental vaccines under field conditions in countries in which East Coast fever is endemic.",

Helminths may also modulate the immune system as exemplified by the filarial nematodes, which are present in 150\u2013200 million humans worldwide and cause river blindness for example. These filarial nematodes are difficult to combat because they modulate T cell responses leading to chronic helminth infections (reviewed by Hoerauf et al., 2005). This T cell modulation is not restricted to the response to filarial larvae but also affects allergies, the response to other pathogens and vaccines through modulation of not only antigen\u2010specific T cells but also APCs, which affects immune responses in general.",

However, the baculovirus expression system may be a valuable tool for these parasitic worms as illustrated by the following examples: a baculovirus\u2010derived subunit vaccine against liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) based on procathepsin L3 conferred 50% protection to rats, in contrast to the yeast\u2010expressed protein which did not confer any protection (Reszka et al., 2005). Bilharzia or schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma spp. (Platyhelminthes), blood parasites of humans in tropical areas. Several Schistosoma genes have been expressed in insect cells, but primarily for analysis of enzymatic functions. The large subunit of calpain (SmP80) produced in the baculovirus expression system reduced the worm burden in mice (Hota\u2010Mitchell et al., 1997). Antigens of the tapeworm Taenia solium have been expressed with baculovirus vectors for diagnostic purposes (Lee 2005, Levine 2004).",

            "text": "There are many examples in the literature where immunization with recombinant proteins produced in the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system conferred good protection against infectious disease. Subunit vaccine development begins with careful identification of the antigen, which is related to whether neutralizing adaptive immune responses are raised against the particular protein in natural infections. Once selected, the open reading frame (ORF) of the antigen is cloned while keeping flanking DNA sequences to a minimum, which can best be achieved with a proof\u2010reading PCR enzyme. The sequence around the ATG translational start site is best modified to that of the polyhedrin or p10 gene in the wild\u2010type baculovirus, with at least an adenosine residue at the \u22123 position (Chang et al., 1999). Tags may be added to facilitate purification, preferably in such a way that they can subsequently be removed. Tags are not required for VLPs because they can be purified by centrifugation. Transmembrane (glyco)proteins are best produced in a secreted form by removal of TMRs to increase expression levels. However, this may occasionally affect the folding of the protein. An alternative approach is to fuse the immunogenic domains of envelope proteins to GP64. Vectors that lack chitinase and v\u2010cathepsin genes are preferable for expression of envelope proteins. During the preparation of seed stocks, care should be taken to keep the virus passage number low and to use a multiplicity of infection of <0.1 to minimize the formation of DIs. Careful checking of the purity of recombinant bacmids or plaque purified recombinant viruses by PCR is crucial to avoid loss of recombinant virus in subsequent passages due to empty vectors that out\u2010compete the recombinants.",

With these vaccines in the market (although a nonvaccination policy still exists) the confidence in this type of subunit vaccine will grow as well as the possibilities for registration, thereby increasing the likelihood that more vaccines of this kind will appear in the market. This expectation of an increasing number of products may be expanded to human applications when registration of a trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine, for which phase III clinical trials in humans in the United States have been completed recently, can be achieved. Therapeutic anticancer vaccines, such as a vaccine against prostate cancer, may be more readily accepted, in view of the severe side effects of anticancer drugs and irradiation techniques. The application of baculovirus display or BacMam\u2122 vectors for vaccines against infectious disease may be applied in the future for animal use. Because more foreign proteins are incorporated into the vaccine than just the targeted antigen, such vaccines for human use are likely to be in the more distant future because of safety considerations.",

For those cases though, where folding or posttranslational modifications are crucial to epitope formation the baculovirus\u2013insect cell system is a versatile expression system and many candidate vaccines have been successfully tested. Alternative methods are provided by the development of DNA vaccine technology and recombinant carrier vaccines based on vaccinia, adenovirus, or BacMam\u2122 vectors (Table II). These methods are more prone to induce cellular immune responses than many protein subunit vaccines. The combination of a primary vaccine with an intracellular delivery system (recombinant carrier vaccines, DNA vaccines, BacMam\u2122 vectors) followed by a boost immunization with recombinant protein subunits appears to be a promising approach, aimed at both cellular and humoral immune responses. This approach can be further strengthened through the addition of recombinant cytokines that drive the immune response in a specific direction. A major challenge now is to broaden the array of viral vaccines produced in insect cells and to develop effective vaccines against more complex organisms, such as protozoan parasites and multicellular worms, for which the baculovirus expression system also holds promise. With the increasing insight into immunology leading to new methods of vaccine production and delivery, accompanied by a wealth of genomic and proteomic data, many new generation vaccines are expected within the foreseeable future.",
