Unlike bacterial cells, which are free-living entities, viruses utilize the host cell environment to propagate new viruses. The newly made viruses then leave the host cell, sometimes killing it in the process, and proceed to infect other cells within the host. Virus infection can cause a mild illness as a cold or a deadly illness as the bloody African fever. The viruses that cause Lassa fever and Ebola fever and the retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are examples spreading easily, threatening people\u2019s life and health sometimes swiftly, and for which there is no cure or vaccine (Jassim and Naji 2003). Viral infection has become one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Golean et al. 2009).",

Each strain of virus has its unique configuration of surface molecules, which work like keys in locks, enabling viruses enter into hosts by accurately fitting the molecules on their surfaces of target cells (Jassim and Naji 2003). Since viruses and hosts are intimately connected, the designing of effective anti-virals that will inhibit the viral enzymes or its replication without affecting the host cells has proved to be difficult (Golean et al. 2009; Chattopadhyay et al. 1999). The public health measures and prophylactic vaccines are still the important means, by which society controls the spread of viral infections.",

Since viral enzymes are crucial for disease progression and virus replication, inhibitors against viral enzymes have been the most desirable strategies. Most of the well-studied inhibitors against HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) or the influenza viruses target the host cell binding (T-20, betulinic acid, etc.), uncoating of capsid (amantadine derivatives, pleconaril), replication (reverse transcriptase inhibitors like zidovudine or abacavir, nevirapine, etc.), integrase inhibitors, DNA or RNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, cidofovir, ribavirin, etc.), proteinase involved in viral polyprotein precursors and assembly/maturation inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir and rimantadine, etc.). Based on this strategy, numerous compounds have been tested on different viruses in the past decades, but there are still less than 40 licensed anti-virals in the market (Chattopadhyay et al. 2009).",

In the 1970s, the antiviral activities of extracts from grape, apple, strawberry and other fruit juices against HSV, poliovirus type 1, coxsackievirus B5 and echovirus 7 were reported (Konowalchuk and Speirs 1976, 1978a, b). In 1995, 100 British Colombian medicinal plants were also reported to have antiviral activities, 12 out of which showed significant antiviral effect against corona viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para-influenza virus type 3 (PI3), herpesvirus type 1 (HSV-1) and retavirus (McCutcheon et al. 1995). In 1998, more than 800 common Chinese herbal medicines were detected for antiviral activities against HIV and more than 100 plants exhibited anti-HIV activities (Lou 1998). In 2005, more than 200 Chinese herbal medicines were screened for antiviral activities against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 4 out of which showed potent antiviral activities (Li et al. 2005a).",

            "text": "As potential anti-HIV drug candidates, sulfated polysaccharides offer a number of promising features. Some polysulfates show a differential inhibitory activity against different HIV strains, suggesting that marked differences exist in the target molecules with which polysulfates interact. They not only inhibit the cytopathic effect of HIV, but also prevent HIV-induced syncytium (giant cell) formation. Furthermore, experiments carried out with sulfate samples of increasing molecular weight and with sulfated cyclodextrins of different degrees of sulfation have shown that antiviral activity increases with increasing molecular weight and degree of sulfation (Duarte et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2010; Karmakar et al. 2010). A sugar backbone is not strictly needed for the anti-HIV activity of polysulfates because sulfated polymers composed of a carbon\u2013carbon backbone have also proved to be highly efficient anti-HIV agents in vitro. Other, yet to be defined, structural features may also play an important role. From studies on their mechanism of action, polysulfates appear to exert their anti-HIV activity by shielding off the positively charged sites in the V3 loop of the viral envelope glycoprotein (gp120), which is necessary for virus attachment to cell surface heparan sulfate, a primary binding site, before more specific binding occurs to the CD4 receptor of CD4+ cells (Huheihel et al. 2002). This general mechanism also explains the broad antiviral activity of polysulfates against enveloped viruses. Variations in the viral envelope glycoprotein region may result in differences in the susceptibility of different enveloped viruses to compounds that interact with their envelope glycoproteins. The efficacy of sulfated polysaccharide against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) were demonstrated in vivo (rats and rabbits) (Huheihel et al. 2002).",

Current results about the mechanisms of action underlying their antiviral properties suggest a combination of effects on both the virus and the host cell. Flavonoids have been reported to affect virus binding, entry, replication, viral protein translation, formation of certain virus envelope glycoprotein complexes and virus release (Andres et al. 2009). They also affect a variety of host cell signaling processes, including induction of gene transcription factors and secretion of cyto\u00adkines (Andres et al. 2009). Although enormous promising results were from in vitro experiments, a few in vivo results can partly confirm their in vivo efficacy (Miki et al. 2007). Flavonoids possess antiviral properties against a wide range of viruses under both in vitro and in vivoconditions (see Table 3.4 and Fig. 3.1).\n\n",

Their ability to inhibit several different viruses was evaluated. Among the catechins, the EGCG and ECG were found to be potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication in MDCK cell culture and this effect was observed in all influenza virus subtypes tested, including A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B virus (Demeule et al. 2002). However, the sensitivity in hemagglutination inhibition was widely different among three different subtypes of influenza viruses tested. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that, at high concentration, EGCG and ECG also suppressed viral RNA synthesis in MDCK cells whereas EGC failed to show similar effect (Song et al. 2005). Similarly, EGCG and ECG inhibited the neuraminidase activity more effectively than the EGC (Song et al. 2005). The results show that the 3-galloyl group of catechin skeleton plays an important role on the observed antiviral activity, whereas the 5\u2032-OH at the trihydroxy benzyl moiety at 2-position plays a minor role (Song et al. 2005). In addition, EGCG has not only potential use as adjunctive therapy in HIV-1 infection (Williamson et al. 2006), but has greater anti-HSV activity than other green tea catechins and inactivates multiple clinical isolates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by binding to gB, gD, or another envelope glycoprotein, it appears to be a promising candidate for use in a microbicide to reduce HSV transmission (Isaacs et al. 2008). Among green tea chatechins, EGCG was the most effective when added to the cells during the transition from the early to the late phase of adenovirus infection, suggesting that EGCG inhibits one or more late steps in virus infection (Webster et al. 2006). It is worth to mention that Veregen (80% catechins) as a prescription drug for condyloma treatment was approved by US FDA in 2006, suggesting that medicinal plants will open up new prospects for the pharmaceutical industry (Reuter et al. 2010).",

The antiviral action of 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid was specific against RSV, as they had no obvious antiviral activity against influenza A (Flu A), Coxsackie B3 (Cox B3), and Herpes simplex type one (HSV-1) viruses (Li et al. 2005\nb). Studies indicated that the dicaffeoylquinic acids could inhibit RSV directly, extracellularly, but only at much higher concentrations than seen in standard assays. Moreover, they could not inhibit RSV attachment to host cells, and could not protect HEp-2 cells from RSV infection at lower concentrations. The data suggest that the compounds exert their anti-RSV effects via the inhibition of virus\u2013cell fusion in the early stage, and the inhibition of cell\u2013cell fusion at the end of the RSV replication cycle (Li et al. 2005\nb).\n",

Among them, caffeic acid exhibited the strongest activity against HSV-1 (EC50  =  15.3 \u03bcg/ml, SI  =  671), HSV-2 (EC50  =  87.3 \u03bcg/ml, SI  =  118) and ADV-3 (EC50  =  14.2 \u03bcg/ml, SI  =  727), whereas chlorogenic acid possessed the strongest anti-ADV-11 (EC50  =  13.3 \u03bcg/ml, SI  =  301) activity (Wang et al. 2009).

Further characterization of the active ingredients will reveal useful compounds. Some of these compounds belong to a wide range of different structural classes, e.g. coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, lignans, terpenes, naphtho- and anthraquinones, polysaccharides, proteins and peptides. There may also be novel phytochemicals. Although large numbers of new compounds have been isolated from medicinal plants, only some have been marketed as pharmaceutical products. Several compounds have been or are undergoing various phases of clinical trials. The traditional use of some of the medicinal plants for the treatment of infectious diseases of viral origin, therefore, is justified. In conclusion, active phytochemicals will provide important information for the development of new medicinal plant products in controlling the threats posed by some pathogenic viruses.",
