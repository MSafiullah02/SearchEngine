The most abundant is the membrane (M) protein, spanning the membrane three or four times and interacting with the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins during assembly (Escors et al., 2001, Rottier, 1995). The second most abundant is the S protein, a large type I-transmembrane glycoprotein that forms peplomers and is responsible for cell receptor binding and membrane fusion (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002, Sui et al., 2004, Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990, Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1991). The third is the small envelope (E) protein, a transmembrane protein detected as a minor structural component in TGEV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS-CoV, and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Godet et al., 1992, Liu and Inglis, 1991, Shen et al., 2003, Yu et al., 1994). Another essential constituent of the virion is the N protein, an internal phosphoprotein that interacts with the genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid (Escors et al., 2001, Kapke and Brian, 1986, Narayanan and Makino, 2001).",

            "text": "Coronavirus maturation takes place at the cis-Golgi network also known as endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Salanueva et al., 1999, Tooze et al., 1984, Tooze et al., 1987). The E protein plays an important role during virus budding and transiently resides in a pre-Golgi compartment before progressing to the Golgi apparatus (Corse and Machamer, 2000, Maeda et al., 1999, Raamsman et al., 2000). It has been proposed that the E protein induces virus envelope curvature in pre-Golgi membranes during MHV and SARS-CoV infections (Arbely et al., 2004, Kuo et al., 2002). Studies on the assembly of coronavirus structural proteins by heterologous mammalian expression systems have shown that coexpression of E and M proteins from bovine coronavirus (BCoV), MHV, TGEV, IBV, and SARS-CoV results in the formation of virus like-particles (VLPs) that are morphologically identical to spikeless virions (Baudoux et al., 1998, Corse and Machamer, 2000, Hsieh et al., 2005, Kuo et al., 2007, Mortola and Roy, 2004, Vennema et al., 1996). In addition, it has been described that both the MHV and IBV E proteins are sufficient for the generation of VLPs (Corse and Machamer, 2000, Maeda et al., 1999). These observations suggested that neither the N nor the S proteins are needed for viral budding. In contrast, recent studies (Huang et al., 2004) described that M and N proteins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles. Therefore, the role of E protein in coronavirus morphogenesis requires additional studies.",

Recently, a recombinant MHV virus with the entire gene E deleted was constructed (Kuo and Masters, 2003). This virus replicates with a low infectious titer, indicating that E protein is critical, but not essential for MHV replication in vitro. At variance, our laboratory has described an essential role for the E protein during TGEV replication. rTGEV-\u0394E virus was rescued by complementation within E+ packaging cell lines (Ortego et al., 2002).",

In contrast, for group 1 coronavirus TGEV, we and others (Curtis et al., 2002, Ortego et al., 2002) have shown that cells transfected with an E gene-deleted TGEV infectious cDNA do not produce infectious virus. Similarly, a gene E knockout mutant of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV), is unable to produce infectious progeny (Snijder et al., 1999). Kuo and Masters have suggested that the apparent lethality of E gene knockouts in EAV and TGEV may reflect a slow infection kinetics of these viruses that would allow uninfected cells to overgrow infected cells and obscure the detection of \u0394E mutants of some nidovirus (Kuo and Masters, 2003). Our results clearly showed, in this and in a previous publication (Ortego et al., 2002), that E protein is essential for TGEV replication and that no infectious virus was produced at all. A simple explanation is that these viruses belong to different CoV groups and have different assembly requirements. The generation of infectious rTGEV-\u0394E virus was dependent on E protein expression and independent of the infected cell line. Thus, rTGEV-\u0394E infected cells did not secrete virus to the extracellular medium, and the virus did not spread to neighboring uninfected cells, and therefore did not generate plaques in infected ST-E\u2212 cells up to 96 h post-infection, confirming that rTGEV-\u0394E is a propagation-deficient virus in the absence of E protein provided in trans. Furthermore, no virus amplification was observed using supernatants or cell extracts from BHK-pAPN-E\u2212 cells infected with rTGEV-\u0394E virus when used to infect fresh BHK-pAPN-E+ cells, although these cells could have amplified minute amounts of rTGEV-\u0394E virus. These data confirmed that E protein was essential for TGEV virus replication. Therefore, a different behavior is shown by coronavirus from groups 1 and 2 in the requirement for E protein during virus assembly.",

In contrast, Huang and coworkers reported that two viral genes, encoding the SARS-CoV M and N proteins, are necessary and sufficient for formation of VLPs by cotransfection of expression plasmids (Huang et al., 2004). This discrepancy could be explained by the different cell types used in these studies (insect S\u01929 and human 293T cells, respectively). In our study, electron microscopy analysis of BHK-pAPN-E\u2212 cells infected with rTGEV-\u0394E demonstrated that only immature TGEV virions were assembled in the absence of E protein. These virions contained RNA, and also all the structural TGEV proteins (S, M, and N) except the deleted E protein. These results indicate that the E protein is essential for the formation of mature TGEV virions. In the absence of E protein, the assembled virions displayed a morphology different from the full-length virus, were non-infectious, accumulated in the cytoplasm of the infected cells, and were not released to the extracellular medium or transported to neighboring cells.",

Virions were assembled as large particles with annular morphology at perinuclear compartment of the cells, and changed their morphology into small dense virions during the transport along the exocytic route (Risco et al., 1998, Tooze et al., 1987). In cells infected with rTGEV-\u0394E, an accumulation of the KDEL receptor and the lack of fragmentation and dispersion of Golgi membranes were observed in absence of E protein. These effects and rTGEV-\u0394E virus assembly into mature particles were recovered by providing E protein in trans. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy studies with an intermediate compartment specific marker confirmed that, in the absence of the E protein, the maturation of the virus is arrested in the ERGIC. A similar effect has been described when TGEV infection is blocked with monensin, a drug that selectively affects the Golgi complex interrupting the secretory pathway. Monensin blocks the viral transport from ERGIC, leading to the accumulation of numerous large viral particles in dilated pre-Golgi ERGIC elements of vacuolar morphology (Salanueva et al., 1999). The comparable deficiencies observed in viral morphogenesis in the absence of E protein and as a result of treatment with monensin suggest an aberrant assembly process due to the absence of E protein. In principle, E protein could act directly on the ERGIC and Golgi compartments, on the virus itself, or in both. It has been postulated that E protein prepares the membrane or other viral proteins occupying strategic positions within the budding pathways (Salanueva et al., 1999), as proposed for small acylated glycoproteins of alphaviruses and orthomyxoviruses that also display ion channel activity (Gaedigk-Nitschko et al., 1990, Ivanova et al., 1995, Liao et al., 2006, Wilson et al., 2004, Zebedee and Lamb, 1988). The absence of E protein would inhibit the progression through the ERGIC-Golgi compartments, resulting in the accumulation of virions in the ERGIC and of the ERGIC itself.",

Viroporins act at late stages of the viral cycle promoting the exit of new virus particles from the cell (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). The exact mechanism by which viroporins alter the permeability of the plasma membrane is unknown, and it is possible that this activity is displayed both at the plasma membrane and on cellular organelles (Aldabe et al., 1997, Van kuppeveld et al., 1997). Coronavirus E protein localizes in membranes of ERGIC, where it could modify their permeability, leading to the disruption of ion gradients at intracellular organelles (Madan et al., 2005), facilitating the transport of the virions along the exocytic pathway and their maturation. The absence of this viroporin activity mediated by the E protein possibly leads to the arrest of the transport of virions through the secretory pathway, the accumulation of non-mature virions in ERGIG, and the absence of release of new infectious virus from the cell. The construction of E protein mutants affecting E protein ion channel activity could assess whether this postulate is correct.",

The diverse channel selectivity among the coronavirus groups could be translated in differences in the effect of E protein in the secretory pathway and may explain the discrepancies among the gene E-defective mutants from the three coronavirus groups, and why E protein is essential for replication of group 1 viruses and non-essential for replication of group 2 viruses.
