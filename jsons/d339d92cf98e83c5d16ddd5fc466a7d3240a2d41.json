Design and Setting: A total of 101 samples were collected from different surfaces in public places in the region of Belo Horizonte with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Samples were collected near the hospital and public transportation areas using sterile swabs, and then submitted to nucleic acid extraction and genomic detection and quantification by one-step qPCR. Results: Seventeen of the 101 samples tested positive (16.8%) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including samples from bus stations/terminals, public squares, and sidewalks, including those near hospitals. Conclusions and Relevance: Our data indicated the contamination of public surfaces by SARS-CoV-2, especially near hospital areas, highlighting the risk of infection for the population.

            "text": "Horizonte is the capital of Minas Gerais State, one of the most populous metropolitan regions in Brazil (a population of 6 million people). The city recorded 845 confirmed cases and 20 deaths due to COVID-19. 6 The areas within Belo Horizonte where most of the deaths and confirmed cases have occurred correspond precisely to areas with public squares, bus stations/terminals, and hospital areas, i.e., where a large flow and concentration of people is commonly observed. 6 Recent studies have identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on different surfaces and environments inside hospitals, revealing the dynamics of viral dissemination within these places. 7,8 SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on different types of surfaces, such as metal and plastic, for up to 72 hours, depending on the type of surface material, and can remain infectious in aerosols for at least 3 hours. 9 Assessing the presence of the virus in the environment, objects, and surfaces in public areas is fundamental for understanding the risk of infection in the population. In addition, any information gained can be used by health managers to control population movements in these areas, as well as implement environmental disinfection measures. In this context, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a downtown area of Belo Horizonte in April 2020 (Figure 1). This region of the city (central-southeast) has the highest concentration of hospitals and health units and the highest number of notified COVID-19 cases (Figure 1). Importantly, this part of the city also has a large number of people accessing public transportation and transportation facilities daily. A total of 101 samples were collected from the following 30 locations (Figure 1): i) 15 bus stations (stops) (for each bus station, one sample was collected from a bench and two All rights reserved.

For the collection of environmental samples, swabs with sterile phosphate-buffered saline were vigorously rubbed on surfaces (10 cm 2 ) of the aforementioned objects. The swabs were then transferred to tubes containing transport solution (1 mL of guanidine isothiocyanate buffer, 4 M). For each sample, 70 \u00b5L of transport solution containing a sample was submitted to nucleic acid extraction using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Maryland, USA). Total RNA (5 \u00b5L) was used as a template for one-step qPCR (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) (in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L per reaction, GoTaq1-sept qPCR system, Promega), using primers and probes specific for the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (CDC, USA, 2020). Samples were considered positive if both targets had a cycle threshold (Ct) less than 40 (CDC, USA, 2020). Negative (extraction control and non-template control) and positive controls (RNA extracted from inactivated SARS-CoV-2, kindly provided by Dr. Danielle Durigon and Dr. Edison Durigon, USP, Brazil) were used. To confirm the results, all positive samples were submitted to a second round of RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. Quantification of viral RNA in the environmental samples was based on a standard curve generated from serial dilutions (1:10) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and converted to genomic units per square meter of surface (N1 gene). SARS-CoV-2 RNA control was previously quantified as described elsewhere. 10 A total of seventeen samples (16.8%) were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Table 1). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 6 of the 15 tested bus stations (5.9%) located in front of hospitals, with loads ranging from 20 to 620 genomic units/m 2 . Four of these positive samples were collected from bus station benches and two from the ground under the benches. The following hospitals presented SARS-CoV-2-positive bus stations: hospital A, 1 positive/4 assayed stations; hospital B (3 positive/4 assayed stations); hospital C (1 positive/3 assayed stations); and hospital H (1 positive/1 assayed station). We also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the front-door sidewalk of hospital D (0.9%) (2,990 genomic units/m 2 ). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in three",

Despite a relatively small number of samples, it is surprising that almost 20% of the sampled sites were positive for the presence of the virus, especially when dealing with places with a large flow of pedestrians. Although Belo Horizonte has relatively few cases when compared with other cities in Brazil, such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, our data indicate that the virus is circulating in the city and can be found on surfaces such as benches, tables, handrails, and floors, and in places with a large flow of people, such as public squares and hospital entrances. The detection of the viral RNA at these sites indicates that adequate cleaning of public environments and reinforcement of educational campaigns for hygienic and social distancing practices should be undertaken. Our study highlights the need for the constant assessment of the presence of the virus, not only in hospital facilities, but also in places close to medical areas and with a large circulation of people. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these environments can result in an increase in the number of cases of the disease in the near future if control measures are not forcefully adopted.
