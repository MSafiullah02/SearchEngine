Evans and colleagues27 carried out a prospective analysis of 10 anticoagulated patients requiring vitamin K antagonist reversal. PCC administration resulted in the immediate cessation of bleeding and a satisfactory clinical response in all patients. These data were corroborated by a larger prospective study (n=42), where the correction of INR to \u22641.9 was observed within 20 min of PCC administration.33 The rapid infusion of PCCs [median dose 22.0 IU kg\u22121 (\u00b13.0), total infusion time of 3 min] has been used for immediate anticoagulant reversal before neurosurgery in patients with ICH.35 All patients displayed complete INR correction immediately after PCC bolus, allowing anticoagulated patients to be managed as rapidly as non-anticoagulated patients.35 Pabinger and colleagues32 investigated the impact of infusion speed upon the effectiveness of PCC administration for emergency reversal of vitamin K antagonist therapy. Infusion speeds of between 2.0 and 40.0 ml min\u22121 were used, and the resulting effects on INR and observed thrombogenicity marker pharmacokinetics were recorded. The infusion speed used had no effect upon the INR attained after 30 min, or on the plasma concentrations of thrombogenicity markers. This study provides the first prospective evidence that PCCs can be rapidly infused without impacting safety or efficacy.32\n",

Since patients receiving PCCs to reverse anticoagulation therapy have an underlying tendency to thrombosis, such reversal is likely to increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Secondly, therapeutic factors such as concomitant surgery or the level of PCC dosing administered can increase risk. Finally, thrombogenesis may be influenced by the quality of the PCC preparation used, with the exclusion of activated coagulation factors and inclusion of anticoagulant agents (proteins C, S, Z, antithrombin, and heparin) of particular importance.39\n",

A biochemical comparison of several commercially available PCCs identified Beriplex P/N as well balanced for all four of coagulation factors present, containing the highest concentration of the therapeutic protein FX, while also being the most pure of all the products tested and possessing the greatest thrombin inhibition potential.16 A clinical evaluation monitored the pharmacokinetics of PCC coagulation factors in healthy volunteers (n=15) post-Beriplex P/N administration. Large increases in clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and anticoagulant proteins C and S were observed.

            "text": "The current article represents an update to the data previously reviewed by S\u00f8rensen and colleagues, as more cases of thromboembolic events potentially associated with PCC administration are included. A total of 21 cases of thromboembolic events possibly related to PCC administration have been reported during the observation period reported here. In all of these 21 cases, patients were severely ill and a prothrombotic status is assumed. Even if a direct causal relationship between PCC administration and these thromboembolic events was supposed, the number is small with respect to the number of treatments (one in \u223c31 000). A recent meta-analysis of both three- and four-factor PCCs administered for the reversal of vitamin K antagonist therapy identified a low but quantifiable risk of thromboembolic complications associated with such therapy.56 Overall, the rate of thromboembolic events across all studies was 1.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8\u20132.1], although this was slightly increased in patients receiving four-factor PCCs [1.8% (95% CI: 1.0\u20133.0)]. Reported thrombosis rates, even in those patients receiving anticoagulant therapies, can be as high as 24.4%, for example, after orthopaedic surgery.57 It is therefore important to consider why the incidence of thromboembolic events reported in this pharmacovigilance database is lower than others reported. The most likely explanation for the disparity relates to the under-reporting of such events in patients receiving PCC therapy. It is very important that physicians report any events they consider may be related to PCC administration to build the evidence base. One problem with such reporting is that it is often difficult to distinguish between thromboses resulting from PCC administration and those due to the pre-existing, unmasked prothrombotic condition for which patients were often receiving anticoagulant therapy originally.58 It is important to balance the low risk of thromboembolism associated with PCC administration with its efficacy in treating life-threatening bleeding. A recent prospective study (n=160) analysed the efficacy and safety of PCCs [Beriplex P/N, Octaplex, or Prothromplex\u00ae (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA)] administered for the emergency reversal of vitamin K antagonist therapy due to bleeding or the need for urgent surgery. The clinical efficacy of PCC therapy was considered good in 91% of patients, while their administration was associated with a low risk of thromboembolic complications [3.8% (95% CI: 1.4\u20138.0%)].58\n",

It should be noted that the only incidences of viral transmission reported during this meta-analysis related to four cases of parvovirus B19 infection observed during two studies documenting Octaplex administration. Since receiving marketing authorization, no cases of pathogen transmission linked to Beriplex P/N administration have been reported. A two-step pathogen removal process during the manufacture of Beriplex P/N comprises both the pasteurization and nanofiltration of the concentrate, facilitating both viral inactivation and elimination, respectively.61 These processes eliminate all viruses which have been tested for, most notably influenza virus (H5N2, H7N1, H1N1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (specific model virus for hepatitis C virus), herpes simplex virus 1 (non-specific model virus for large enveloped DNA viruses), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (specific model virus for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), West Nile virus, canine parvovirus (model virus for parvovirus B19V), poliomyelitis virus type 1, HIV, and hepatitis virus (A and B variants). Monitoring of prion proteins during the purification process showed these to be significantly reduced.61 In summary, pharmacovigilance data, in connection with published clinical studies and an assessment of purification processes, show Beriplex P/N to be well tolerated in relation to transfusion-transmitted pathogens.22\n27\n31, 32, 33\n47\n61\n62\n",

The treatment of trauma-related bleeding is one such setting where the administration of PCCs is increasing.64\n65 A retrospective analysis of trauma patients receiving PCC therapy in conjunction with fibrinogen concentrate revealed improved survival rates compared with those predicted by both the trauma injury severity score and the revised injury severity classification score.65 In view of these initial results, there is a clear requirement for more prospective studies to further elucidate the efficacy of PCC administration as a therapeutic option in the treatment of trauma-related bleeding.",

A pharmacovigilance report detailing the 15 yr administration of Beriplex P/N across clinical settings shows this product to be both well tolerated and effective. After \u223c647 250 infusions, no cases of virus transmission or HIT type II possibly related to Beriplex P/N administration have been reported. Extensive data have demonstrated that the risk of thromboembolic events is low. These data are further supported by clinical data for the other commercially available four-factor PCCs. The low incidence of serious thromboembolic and other AEs is mitigated by their efficacy, in particular, the speed at which they are able to cessate bleeding in life-threatening situations.",
