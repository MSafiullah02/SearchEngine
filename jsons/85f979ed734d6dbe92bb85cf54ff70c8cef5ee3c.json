Researchers have discovered lineage B beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoVs in insectivorous Rhinolophus and Chaerephon bats in China. The nucleotide sequences in the ORF1ab, E, M, and N genes in these bat-borne lineage B beta-CoVs are 89%-93% similar to those in the SARS-CoVs from humans. The CoVs were thus named \"SARS-like CoVs\" (SL-CoVs). The finding of diverse SL-CoVs in bats led to the hypothesis that Rhinolophus bats were the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoVs [2] [3] [4] . However, this hypothesis is challenged by the significant differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequences in certain hypervariable regions. These regions include the S1 domain of the viral spike glycoprotein (S) and the open reading frames (ORFs) that encode a set of accessory proteins, particularly ORF8. Although a functionally similar bat-origin S gene was recently identified in the SL-CoVs of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats) and Rhinolophus affinis (WIV1, Rs3367, and LYRa11), it had less sequence similarity to the human-origin S gene [2, 5] . Furthermore, genetic evidence for the identical ORF8 is needed to trace the origin of SARS-CoVs to bat SL-CoVs.",

However, type III ORF8s were detected in multiple bat species, including R. sinicus. We are the first to have found a type I ORF8 in bat lineage B beta-CoVs. Type I ORF8 is rare. In the country-wide screening, we found that only 2 CoVs collected from R. sinicus in Kunming City in Yunnan Province (Rs-betacoronavirus/Yunnan2013) and Hezhou City in Guangxi Province (Rs-betacoronavirus/Guang-xi2013) contained type I ORF8s. Thus, according to the currently available data, R. sinicus is the only bat species that harbors SL-CoVs with type I ORF8.

The ORF8 nearly identical to that in SARS-CoV was found only in SL-CoVs from R. sinicus and traces the source of SARS-CoVs to Chinese horseshoe bats. Functional studies for the proteins of ORF8, ORF8a, and ORF8b have been reported. The 8a protein enhances SARS-CoV replication and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis [11] . The expression of the 8b protein is related to DNA synthesis and the degradation of E protein [12] [13] . The ORF8 protein may be functional in SL-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum [14] . However, the ORF8 region may code for a functionally unimportant protein for human SARS-CoVs, because gradual deletions in this region found in the early phase, the middle phase, and the late phase of the epidemic of SARS did not apparently affect the survival of the virus [9] . Thus, changes in this region can act as fingerprints to trace the genesis of SARS-CoVs. The identical ORF8s found in SL-CoVs from R. sinicus and SARS-CoVs from patients in the early phase of the SARS epidemic provides a link indicating that the first human infection with SARS-CoV may have originated from bats.",

The supply of wildlife in Guangdong comes from surrounding provinces, such as Guangxi, Yunnan, Hunan, and Fujian. The SL-CoVs from R. sinicus have nearly identical ORF8s and similar backbone genes to those in SARS-CoVs in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. Furthermore, the observation that SL-CoVs from R. sinicus are prone to recombine with CoVs from other hosts may suggest that the wildlife markets in Guangdong may provide an ideal incubator for the genesis of SARS-CoVs. Moreover, human consumption of wildlife increases the possibility of human exposure to viruses carried by wildlife. SL-CoVs closely related to human SARS-CoVs are still present in nature, and the custom of wildlife consumption is ongoing. Thus, there is an ongoing risk of SARS reemergence or the emergence of a similar zoonotic infectious disease in humans.",

In our study in 2012, we used the same metagenomic methods to detect SL-CoV genomes in civets from Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian provinces that supply palm civets to the markets in Guangdong. However, we did not detect any SARS-CoV or SL-CoV sequences in any samples. This finding is consistent with a non-civetorigin CoV reported prior to SARS and after the pandemic.",
