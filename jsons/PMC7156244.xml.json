We, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone d'Onco-G\u00e9riatrie (SoFOG) and the French cooperative group for clinical research in geriatric oncology DIALOG (GERICO-UCOG), would like to endorse these guidelines and stress further important points for older patients with cancer.",

Prevention with intensified barrier measures is required; however, facing an unprecedented health crisis, the choice between pursuing the standard treatments for these patients (often based on little data in the literature) and a cautious so-called primum non nocere approach, raises many concerns and ethical questions.2 Highly committed to an individualised health-care approach, we think highlighting the following points is essential. First, in light of the potential for patients with cancer to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic treatment decision making should take into account cancer type, disease extent, prognosis, and treatment opportunities irrespective of a patient's age, but acknowledge the excess risks associated with viral infection in older patients. Second, evaluation of life expectancy should be part of treatment decision making. Finally, as much as possible, alternatives to standard therapy that have few side-effects on the immune system (eg, endocrine therapy vs chemotherapy) should be favoured, and are preferred to no treatment, which might lead ultimately, long after the epidemic, to excess cancer-related deaths.",

To avoid serious ethical issues and preserve the highest standards of care and treatment for older patients with cancer, sharing treatment decision making with a geriatrician team remains the best strategy, whenever possible. Through this process, we can indeed avoid under-treatment, often and wrongly influenced by a patient's age alone, and hopefully reach the balanced and appropriate decisions our patients deserve.",
