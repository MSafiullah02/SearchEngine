Since very small nodules and calcifications are extremely challenging due to rather thick slices and loss of signal, MRI is highly recommended as a follow-up tool, to avoid repetitive investigations using ionizing radiation. With the sensitivity of T2-weighted sequences and the potential of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences important differential diagnostic considerations can be provided. Additionally, developing complications, such as pericardial or pleural effusions, empyema or lung abscess, are easily recognized. Current and future studies are to demonstrate that MRI is well suited as a monitoring and follow-up tool during and after therapy and compares favorably with CT or other imaging methods regarding sensitivity and specificity.",

It is characterized by centrilobular inflammation that is concentrated around respiratory bronchioles, with spread to the surrounding alveolar ducts and alveolar spaces. When lobular pneumonia becomes confluent, it may be difficult to separate from lobar pneumonia. From a clinical standpoint it is sometimes difficult to apply these classic categories.

It is common in patients with severe underlying disease, prolonged antibiotics, intravascular devices, and mechanical ventilation. The last one is also termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In a prospective study of 1014 mechanically ventilated patients, VAP developed in 177 patients. The mean time to onset was 9 days, with a median time to onset of 7 days after ICU admission. However, when the daily hazard rate of infection was calculated, it was estimated to be 3.3% at day 5, 2.3% at day 10, and 1.3% at day 15 (Cook et al. 1998 ). This documents a significant decline in pneumonia risk with time. Because the risk for pneumonia is so high early after intubation, pneumonias beginning within the first 5 days (early-onset infection) account for 50% of all episodes of VAP, and the natural history and pathogens of this infection differ from those associated with VAP of late onset (ProD'hom et al. 1994) . Common isolates are Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Typical radiologic patterns cannot be described. This is due to the different circumstances and risk factors, which contribute to the development of HAP. The other explanations are the different organisms responsible for the pneumonia. Within the first days the more common organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae (CravEn and StEGEr 1995) . Later on, Gramnegative rods predominate. The risk factors for mortality from VAP are summarized in Table 13 .1.",

The host defense system includes physical and chemical barriers to infection, the inflammatory response, and the immune response. Physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, prevent invasion by most organisms. Chemical barriers include lysozymes and hydrochloric acid. Lysozymes destroy bacteria by removing cell walls. Hydrochloric acid breaks down food and mucus that contains pathogens. The inflammatory response involves polymorphonuclear leukocytes, basophils, mast cells, platelets and, to some extent, monocytes and macrophages. The immune response primarily involves the interaction of lymphocytes (T and B), macrophages, and macrophage-like cells and their products. These cells may be circulating or may be localized in the immune system's tissues and organs (SprinGhousE 2007) . Primary immune deficiency diseases are disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or does not function properly.

On the other hand, the presence of pulmonary infiltrates leads to a marked increase in signal intensity. This is due to both the increase in proton density and a decrease in magnetic susceptibility effects. They included 22 consecutive patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, necrotizing sarcoid granu-lomatosis, hypersensitivity drug reaction, desquamative interstitial pneumonia-like drug reaction, silicosis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, talcosis, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). All patients had MRI and open lung biopsy. Ten of the 12 patients with parenchymal opacification as the predominant abnormality on MRI had cellular infiltrates pathologically, while fibrosis was present in the other 2. This study demonstrated that the MRI findings correlate with the pathologic findings and that parenchymal opacification on MRI usually indicates an inflammatory process, and therefore potentially treatable disease. Localized areas of fibrosis were easier to identity on CT than on MRI. Again, as mentioned in previous studies, these authors found out that a major limitation of MRI in the assessment of infiltrative lung disease was the low spatial resolution compared with HRCT (Primack et al. 1994 ).",

They reviewed different forms of contrast agent enhancement: MR perfusion imaging, contrast enhanced MR angiography, and MR ventilation imaging. In the clinical context of pneumonia they included 13 patients. The MR perfusion was obtained with a standard low flip-angle gradient-echo sequence with an inversion prepulse. The time-intensity curves after intravenous application of a gadolinium-based non-specific contrast agent showed that in pneumonic tissue there was a steep increase without first passage peak; the dynamics of the contrast agent passage was different from normal lung tissue (Fig. 13.1) . The authors did not suggest replacement of chest X-rays for routine pneumonia diagnosis, but in cases where the differential diagnosis between pulmonary embolism and pneumonia were two main options, patients might benefit from an MR perfusion examination (HaralD-sEth et al. 1999) .",

As a brief summary of the technical considerations the authors noticed the following three factors hampering the application of MRI to the lung and suggested the following strategies to resolve the problems: 1. Low proton density: This is valid for the normal lung parenchyma and especially for lung diseases with loss of tissue such as emphysema. In all other lung diseases, the amount of tissue, fluid, and/or cells is increased. The recommended investigation techniques are: a) T1-weighted spin-echo sequences with short echo times (<7 ms) Pulmonary Infections -Pneumonia b) T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences, such as fast low-angle shot (FLASH), with short echo times (3 ms) c) Higher number of acquisitions d) Administration of contrast agents 2. Signal loss due to physiological motion: a) Breath-hold imaging with fast sequences like FLASH or half-Fourier acquired single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) b) Respiratory gating with navigating techniques, gating in expiration using a belt, and respiratory compensation using reordering of phase encoding c) ECG triggering 3. Susceptibility artefacts because of the multiple airtissue interfaces: As mentioned previously these artefacts degrade imaging of normal lung tissue. After loss of air and concomitant increase of tissue, cells, or fluid significantly reduces the number of air-tissue interfaces and the degree of susceptibility artefacts: a) Use of short echo times for T1-weighted spinecho or gradient-echo sequences b) Use of T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequences or T2-weighted ultrafast TSE-sequences with high turbo factors With regard to infiltrations, the authors concluded that MRI can be used for the detection and characterization of inflammatory pulmonary round infiltrates in immunocompromised patients. Post-contrast T1-weighted FLASH showed a strongly enhancing, ill-defined round infiltration ( Fig. 13. 2), and with HASTE sequence moderate signal intensity was found in a patient with bronchopneumonia ( Fig. 13 .3a-e) (Kauczor and KrEit-nEr 1999) . GaEta et al. (2000) revisited the value of gadoliniumenhanced MRI in the evaluation of chronic infiltrative lung disease. They found out that the presence of enhancing lesions on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI studies may a reliable indicator of inflammation and, consequently, indicates potentially treatable disease. Their study was performed on a 1.5-T scanner obtaining a spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence during full inspiration (TR 168 ms, TE 4.8 ms, FA 75\u00b0, slice thickness 5 mm) (GaEta et al. 2000) .",

To overcome the limitation of morphological features Li et al. (2000) included 62 patients to evaluated suspicious lung nodules with CT and dynamic Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI. Axial T1-weighted images (TR 500 ms, TE 10 ms) with a slice thickness of , 15, 45, 75, 110, and 140 s, and 3, 5, 8 , and 10 min were obtained.

After correlation with pathological findings they found out that nodular fibrosis, inflammatory granulomas, cryptococcoma and inflammatory pseudotumor had a more or less low rate of contrast uptake. On the other hand, focal organizing pneumonia and sclerosing hemangioma had a significant and early enhancement. Taking into account that malignant nodules are characterized by a fast increase in signal intensity during the first pass of the contrast agent (G\u00fcckEl et al. 1996) , at least some nodular lesions could be excluded to be malignant with dynamic MR (Li et al. 2000) .",

(2002) included 20 patients with pulmonary diseases comprising non-small-cell, and bronchioalveolar carcinomas, endobronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma, metastases, pneumonia, Wegener's granulomatosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterio-venous malformation, and bronchogenic cyst. MRI studies were performed at 1.5 T before and after administration of gadolinium using a modified volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) (TR 4.6 ms, TE 1.8 ms, FA 15\u00b0, effective slice thickness 4 mm). Their results demonstrated that reproducible high image quality with effective suppression of artefacts, high resolution, and visualization of gadolinium enhancement could be obtained. RupprEcht et al. (2002) performed a study without contrast agent and investigated a steady-state free precession sequence (true FISP) as a potential alternative to the conventional X-ray in pediatric patients with suspected pneumonia. A true FISP sequence was chosen because of its high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in fluid-and thus T2-dominated infectious pulmonary disease. To overcome breathing artefacts in this particular patient group and to increase the S/N ratio they obtained slice thicknesses of 30-55 mm at a 0.2-T low-field MR system. The true FISP sequence had the following parameters: TR 6 ms, TE 3 ms, FA 90\u00b0. The acquisition time for a triple slice scan was 4.8 s, and the door-to-door time was between 10 and 15 min. All pathological findings in the conventional chest X-ray could be identified in the corresponding MR investigation and the MRI was superior in demonstrating pleural and pericardial effusions. Two small retrocardial pneumonic infiltrates were noted in the MRI only. The authors concluded that this technique could represent an alternative to the conventional chest X-ray (RupprEcht et al. 2002) . Such an alternative might be of special interest in children with Nijmegen-Breakage-Syndrome. This entity is an autosomal recessive chromosomal instability syndrome, characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, skin abnormalities, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, and a strong predisposition to lymphoid malignancy. Because of their sensitivity to ionizing radiation X-ray and CT examination should be avoided (AlibEk et al. 2007) .",

The increase in cell density accompanied with extravascular leakage results in an increase in high water content detectable by MRI.

Especially in this particular group of patients, pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The imaging of infiltrates is very challenging, because the immunosuppression decreases the response of the lung to infectious agents. On the other hand, the patterns of pneumonia are highly variable and depend on multiple factors, like underlying diseases, time course, treatment, e.g. By now, a considerable proportion of pulmonary fungal infections is not diagnosed ante mortem in cancer patients. In addition, especially patients after bone marrow transplantation are often younger and repetitive CT examinations carry an additional radiation burden. LEutnEr et al. (2000) tried to find out how MRI compares with CT regarding the depiction of typical features of pneumonia and the detectability of lesions. MR studies was performed with a 1.5-T system and the imaging protocol consisted of a transversal T2-weighted ultrashort turbo spin-echo sequence (TR 2000-4000 ms, TE 90 ms, slice thickness 6 mm, and six numbers of excitation). In comparison to helical CT (slice thickness 8 mm) they evaluated presence, number, and location of pulmonary infiltrates (nodular, reticular, cysts, cavitation, consolidation, and ground-glass infiltration). In summary, most of the CT and MR examinations (75%) were rated as showing identical results concerning not only the number but also the morphology of different lesions that were due to opportunistic pneumonia. In addition, MRI was able to differentiate between consolidation and ground-glass infiltration (LEutnEr et al. 2000) .",

Multislice CT offers the opportunity to investigate the entire lung with 1 mm slice thickness or less in much shorter than 1 min. Parallel imaging in MRI reduced dramatically the examination time that makes acquisition of the lungs in a few seconds possible. Thin-section helical CT is the gold standard for the evaluation of the lung even for very subtle lesions like small ground-glass opacities around lung nodules. That means, to classify the value of MRI of the lung, studies are necessary that compare MRI with the best CT techniques that are available nowadays. EibEl et al. (2006b) performed a study where they investigated pulmonary abnormalities in 30 immunocompromised patients with parallel MRI and thin-section helical CT. Table 13 .7 summarizes the MR examination protocol for the applied HASTE sequence. It was not the intention of this study to investigate the lung comprehensively. In order not to exceed 1 min examination time, only the HASTE sequence was selected. The result-ing in-room-time was not more than 10 min. The motivation was that MRI can only serve as a real alternative to CT, when the examination time is comparable.",

Ill-defined nodules, ground-glass opacity areas, and consolidations, their location and distribution, and their lesion characteristics (e.g. margin contour, cavitation, calcification) were systematically analyzed. Twenty-two patients had pulmonary abnormalities on CT. In 21 (95%) patients, pneumonia was correctly diagnosed with MRI. One false-negative finding occurred in a patient with ill-defined nodules smaller than 1 cm at CT. One false-positive finding with MR was the result of blurring and respiratory artefacts. That results in a sensitivity of MRI in comparison to 1-mm CT slices of 95%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 88% (EibEl et al. 2006a ). In the detection of ground-glass opacity areas (Fig. 13.4) , consolidations ( Fig. 13 .5), and pleural effusion, MRI seems to be equal to thin-section CT. But the overall detection rate of nodules with MRI was only 72% (186/259). Detailed analyses found out that all nodules larger than 10 mm were reliably detected. The mean size of nodular lesions not found with MRI was 4 mm. This difference likely relates to the section thickness used with CT (1 mm) and MR imaging (6 mm). After this study the authors came to the conclusion that pulmonary imaging for the detection and quantification of infiltrates is highly reliable with modern MR scanners (EibEl et al. 2006b ). Despite these encouraging results it is important to keep in mind is that CT has to be preferred in the detection of calcification, which can indicate some special disease entities and can be a sign of pulmonary scarring.",

Air crescent is a finding more common detectable in the recovery phase and relates to resorption of necrotic tissue in the periphery of the lesion or to retraction of the sequestrum from viable lung parenchyma (Kim et al. 2001 ). This crescent like air collection is associated with a higher risk of massive hemoptysis. Blum et al. (1994) observed another characteristic feature of necrotizing pneumonia. On T2-weighted images higher signal intensity in the center combined with comparatively lower signal intensity in the rim outlined a characteristic feature that they called \"reverse target sign\". While the halo phenomenon is strongly suggestive of invasive aspergillosis in its early course, the reverse target sign is detectable in later stages.
