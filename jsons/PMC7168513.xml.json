            "text": "Vertebrate cells possess PRRs to enable detection of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. Immediately after a pathogen invades the cells, the PRRs detect different combinations of pathogen\u2010specific molecules, such as lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids, called pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns, and activate an innate antiviral response to eliminate the pathogens 1. Among the molecules composing the pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns, pathogen\u2010derived nucleic acids are the most potent mediators of innate antiviral responses. The primary induction of innate antiviral responses through detection of nucleic acids is also critical for subsequent induction of an acquired immunity response. Over the past ten years, the responsible immune surveillance sensors, such as the TLRs, cytosolic RNA sensors (primary RIG\u2010I/MDA5), cytosolic DNA sensors (primary cGAS and others), and sensors of the inflammasome pathway (e.g., the primary NLR family, which consists of two major subfamilies, NLRC and NLRP), have been well characterized 2, 3, 4. These immune surveillance sensors are ubiquitously expressed, enabling detection of pathogens invading at the cell surface and cytoplasmic or nuclear compartment in several cell types and leading to production of type I IFNs, pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by host cells. However, it has also been suggested that these immune surveillance systems must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant immune responses to especially self\u2010nucleic acids derived from damaged cells, senescent cells, apoptotic cells and fertilization 5, 6. Indeed, RIG\u2010I, the cytosolic sensor for RNA, distinguishes self from non\u2010self RNA through its interaction with 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate or 5\u2032\u2010diphosphate, which are not present in the transcribed RNA species in vertebrate cells 1. Both RIG\u2010I and MDA5 are also known to sense the synthetic or viral dsRNA; additionally, MDA5 may also detect dsRNA with a high molecular weight, in contrast to the preferential detection of short dsRNA by RIG\u2010I 7. Studies using genetically engineered mice have revealed that RIG\u2010I is crucial for detection of several negative\u2010stranded RNA viruses (e.g., vesicular stomatitis virus, NDV and influenza A and B virus), as well as detection of positive\u2010stranded RNA viruses (e.g., JEV and HCV) 8. In contrast, MDA5 dominantly detects picornaviruses (e.g., encephalomyocarditis virus). Though exceptions to this requirement have been reported, the ability of RIG\u2010I and MDA5 to distinguish self from non\u2010self in this way ensures that anomalous immune responses to cellular RNA do not occur. Responses to self\u2010DNA such as those described above are far less clear. Cytoplasmic DNA\u2010sensing by cGAS in collaboration with an adaptor protein, STING, does not distinguish between cellular and pathogen\u2010derived DNA 9, 10. Of note, it has also been reported that the chronic inflammatory response induced by self\u2010DNA via cGAS/STING may be responsible for induction of aberrant inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, AGS and polyarthritis 9, 10. While engulfed apoptotic cells represent a possible source of self\u2010DNA, endogenous DNases in both the cytoplasmic (e.g., DNase\u2010III, also referred to as TREX1) and lysosomal (e.g., DNase\u2010II) compartments can degrade these endogenous self\u2010DNAs and ensure that inappropriate responses are not initiated 9, 10. In the case of the leaking of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm following mitochondrial damage, intracellular caspase activation can control the aberrant immune response 11, 12, 13. Similarly, cGAS/STING and its necessary cofactors and cellular DNA are compartmentalized such that sensing of self\u2010DNA is avoided; the receptor in the cytosol and the ligand (DNA) in the nucleus are sequestered 9. Additionally, recent studies have shown that cell cycle progression during mitosis following a DNA\u2010damage response may lead to formation of micronuclei, thereby eliciting a cGAS/STING\u2010mediated micronuclear DNA\u2010sensing immune response 14, 15. Then, following DNA damage and micronuclei formation, cGAS may re\u2010localize to the micronuclei bodies and recognize micronuclear DNA, followed by initiation of downstream signal activation. In addition to the DNA\u2010damage response discussed above, two independent research groups have also reported that the cGAS/STING axis also recognizes an intrinsic DNA during cellular senescence and that this activation precedes induction of an inflammatory response (this is defined as the senescence\u2010associated secretory phenotype) 16, 17. Subsequently, production of senescence\u2010associated secretory phenotype factors such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may reinforce senescence\u2010associated cells via autocrine and paracrine routes. Thus, remarkably, the cGAS/STING pathway appears to regulate inflammatory disorders manifested through detection of self\u2010DNA during DNA damage and cellular senescence. The cGAS/STING pathway may not only be important for recognition of DNA virus infection, but also be critical for the host defense against RNA virus infection. However, the detailed mechanism by which STING controls RNA virus infection remains to be determined. Of note, viruses have evolved an elaborate mechanism for escaping detection by the cGAS/STING axis or for suppressing activation of that pathway; this escape mechanism includes downstream signal activation of the cGAS/STING axis.",

DAI may form a signaling complex with TBK1 and IRF3 for production of type I IFNs in response to synthetic dsDNA or DNA virus infection (e.g., HSV\u20101) in L929 murine fibroblast cells. However, Ishii and colleagues reported that IFN production is not impaired in response to synthetic B\u2010form dsDNA and HSV\u20101 infection in several types of cells that lack DAI function; additionally, DAI\u2010deficient mice have a normal response to plasmid\u2010based DNA immunization 22.

            "text": "Prior to the consecutive introduction of several DNA sensors (described below), Barber and colleagues introduced STING (also referred to as MITA, MPYS or ERIS), which is encoded by the TMEM173 gene and enables activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter. STING is a 379 amino acid protein consisting of multiple transmembrane regions; it is localized in the ER and plays an essential role in cytosolic DNA\u2010mediated innate immune responses and responses to DNA\u2010based immunization 23, 24, 25. Several cytosolic DNA species derived from microbial pathogens can trigger STING\u2010dependent signal activation via either the TBK1\u2010mediated IRF3 axis or IKKs\u2010mediated NF\u2010\u03baB axis. In response to being stimulated by a DNA ligand, STING may dynamically translocate from the ER to the perinuclear\u2010Golgi region, and form a signaling complex with kinase TBK1 in order to induce IRF3 activation. STING may also lead to protein degradation via a ubiquitin\u2010mediated proteasome pathway to terminate signal activation near the perinuclear\u2010Golgi region. It has also been suggested that STING associates with dsDNA directly; however, the physiological relevance such an association remains to be clarified 26. In a later study, it was found that STING binds directly to CDNs, which are known to be bacterially derived second messenger molecules, with high affinity via formation of dimers 27. Around the same time, it was also found that genetically engineered mice with a single point mutation in the STING gene (T596A, referred to as Goldenticket) failed to associate with CDNs or produce type I IFN in response to bacterially produced CDNs 28, suggesting that STING is a direct innate immune sensor for production of CDN\u2010mediated type I IFNs. In addition, several groups have determined the crystal structure of complexes formed by binding between CDNs and STING via the cytoplasmic C\u2010terminal region 29. Through all these points of enquiry, the discovery of STING should improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cytosolic DNA\u2010mediated innate immune responses; however, a cytosolic DNA sensor located in the region upstream of STING may be identified in the future in a universally accepted manner.",

            "text": "Such a cytosolic DNA sensor may be implicated in generation of an endogenous catalytic enzyme that enables production of CDNs in response to DNA pathogens for production of type I IFNs. In 2013, Chen and colleagues reported a major breakthrough in this line of research. Namely, they discovered cGAMP, a type of CND consisting of different phosphodiester linkages, and its catalytic enzyme (cGAS), which is encoded by MB21D1 or C6orf150 gene 30, 31. In the cytoplasm, cGAS may bind directly to viral DNA derived from not only several species of DNA viruses, but also from reverse\u2010transcribed DNA that is produced by retroviruses through reverse transcription of the RNA genome. Following binding of DNA, cGAS may induce conformational rearrangement and catalyze synthesis of cGAMP using cellular adenosine triphosphate and guanosine\u20105\u2032\u2010triphosphate. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that cGAMP may induce STING\u2010dependent signal activation and that this induction would occur via direct association of cGAMP with bacterially\u2010derived CDNs 25. Details of this signaling transduction via the cGAS/STING axis are summarized in Figure 1. Of note, the cGAS/STING\u2010mediated signal transduction does not require protein\u2013protein interactions between sensor and adaptor that characterizes pathways of other PRRs (e.g., the TLR, RIG\u2010I\u2010like receptor and inflammasome pathways); rather, it may be mediated by cGAMP or CDNs. Another interesting point is that cGAMP may be transferred from virus\u2010infected cells to neighboring uninfected cells via gap\u2013junction channels, thereby promoting STING activation independently of type I IFN signaling mediated by the IFN\u2010receptor/JAK\u2010STAT axis 32. This may be considered a novel strategy for rapid conveyance of anti\u2010viral signals in a horizontal manner. Importantly, it has been confirmed that cytosolic DNA\u2010mediated innate immune responses and responses to DNA\u2010based immunization play non\u2010redundant roles in mice, including several cGAS\u2010lacking mouse cell types. The cGAS/STING pathway not only plays crucial roles in host defense against DNA pathogens, but also in induction of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases through sensing of self\u2010DNA. Thus, the cGAS/STING pathway must be properly regulated for maintenance of cellular homeostasis and immune responses. However, details of these subjects are beyond the scope of this review; they have been reported extensively elsewhere.",

Although IFI16 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus in the steady state, it may shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol for sensing of viral DNA 33. In addition, IFI16 may reportedly be involved in both DNA\u2010sensing inflammasome activation and DNA damage responses in apoptotic cells 34. Similar to IFI16, a cytosolic DNA sensor AIM2, which may induce IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 rather than type\u2010I IFNs production through the inflammasome pathway after DNA sensing in the cytosol has been proposed 35, 36, 37. Recently, AIM2\u2010like receptors, of which there are 13 members, all of which possess a pyrin\u2010signaling domain and a DNA\u2010binding HIN domain (e.g., p204, which is seen as a mouse ortholog of human IFI16), have been shown not to contribute to DNA sensing for type\u2010I IFN production or induction of self\u2010DNA\u2010mediated autoimmune diseases such as AGS 38. However, most recently, the establishment of human IFI16\u2010deficient cells on the basis of macrophages and keratinocytes using CRISPR/Cas9 or a TALEN approach indicates that production of type\u2010I IFNs and ISGs in response to synthetic dsDNA and HSV\u20101 infection is impaired 39, 40. Interestingly, these studies also showed that IFI16 is a prerequisite for full\u2010activation of cGAS/STING function; however, in vivo evaluation is needed to fully clarify the physiological relevance of IFI16.",

Crystal structure analyses have revealed that the binding regions for dsDNA and CDNs overlap, suggesting that DDX41 has the potential to recognize different ligands via the DEAD domain 43.

            "text": "There may be a correlation between the DNA damage response and innate immune responses mediated by virus infection; however, Stetson et al. have reported conflicting findings 20. Most recently, it has been suggested that several DNA damage\u2010inducible host factors, such as the catalytic subunit of DNA\u2010PKcs, and its binding co\u2010factors Ku70/80, or Mre11, are involved in the cytosolic DNA\u2010sensing immune response through direct interaction with DNA ligands 44, 45. Upon simulation with synthetic DNA ligands or infection with DNA virus, only partial redundancy of ISG expression was observed in DNA\u2010PKcs\u2010deficient murine cells, suggesting a high potential for a cytosolic DNA\u2010sensing innate immune response. However, it is interesting to note that Mre11 may be specifically involved in the response to synthetic dsDNA, but not involved in the response to DNA virus infection or to treatment with DMXAA, which is known as a STING specific agonist. Additionally, these observations indicate that type\u2010I IFNs are produced in response to stimulation with DNA damage\u2010inducing chemical agents (e.g., etoposide or cisplatin) 46. Recent studies using DNA damage\u2010inducing agents such as 7,12\u2010dimethylbenz\u2010\u03b1\u2010anthracene have suggested that the following pathway underlies the DNA damage\u2010induced immune response via the cytosolic DNA\u2010sensing pathway: 7,12\u2010dimethylbenz\u2010\u03b1\u2010anthracene\u2010induced DNA damage results in nucleosome leakage into the cytosol and then elicits cGAS/STING\u2010dependent signal activation via self\u2010DNA recognition 9. It has been proposed that, in addition to direct sensing of DNA, the indirect machinery of the cytosolic DNA\u2010sensing innate immune response is also involved. leucine\u2010rich repeat Flightless\u2010interacting protein 1 has been shown to function as an amplifier of cytosolic nucleic acid\u2010sensing immune responses for production of type\u2010I IFNs via the transcriptional co\u2010activator \u03b2\u2010catenin but not via IRF3 activation 47.

The kinase TBK1 was the first to be proposed to be involved in positive regulation of STING phosphorylation to promote IRF3 activation. A subsequent study showed that the autophagy\u2010related serine/threonine protein kinases ULK1 and ULK2 are involved in the process of STING phosphorylation that enables termination of signal activation. These results indicate that these distinct kinases, TBK1 and ULK1/2, may possess opposite functions via the same residue S366 for STING phosphorylation. Further studies using genetically engineered mice are needed to resolve these conflicting observations and determine the physiological relevance of ULK1/2. The presence of an additional residue at position S358 of human STING also has the potential to affect STING phosphorylation; however, the impact of this phosphorylation remains to be clarified 50. Most recently, it was shown that ribosomal protein S6K1 may also participate in the positive regulation of STING\u2010dependent signal activation; however, the kinase activity of S6K1 has been found to be dispensable 51. In contrast to the observation of STING\u2010mediated phosphorylation, only one intracellular kinase that is involved in modulation of cGAS function has been reported. A DNA virus (like HSV\u20101)\u2010inducible Akt (also referred to as protein kinase B) may be involved in phosphorylation of cGAS at S305 (at S291 in murine cGAS) within the enzymatic domain of cGAS, thereby suppressing the enzymatic activity of cGAS 52.

Conversely, in addition to TRIM29 and TRIM30\u03b1, E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 may induce degradation of STING via conjugation of K48\u2010linked poly\u2010ubiquitination for termination of signal activation 55, 56, 57. Additionally, each of two distinct molecules\u2014the AMFR\u2010insulin\u2010induced gene 1 (GP78/INSIG1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1\u2014have also been shown to be involved in STING ubiquitination via conjugation of K27\u2010 and K63\u2010linked poly\u2010ubiquitination, respectively, to facilitate STING\u2010dependent signal activation 58, 59. Most recently, it has been reported that RNF26 may catalyze STING ubiquitination via conjugation of K11\u2010linked poly\u2010ubiquitination at the same conjugating site of RNF5. This may be considered to contribute positively to STING function through competition with RNF5\u2010mediated poly\u2010ubiquitination of STING 60. In contrast to the accumulated evidence regarding STING ubiquitination, little is known about cGAS function. The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF185 may be involved in cGAS ubiquitination via conjugation of K27\u2010linked poly\u2010ubiquitination for promotion of an enzymatic activity of cGAS 61. Moreover, it has been shown that TRIM56 may also play a role in cGAS\u2010mediated mono\u2010ubiquitination for facilitation of cGAMP production 62.

The HSV\u20101\u2010encoded tegument protein UL41 has been shown to induce cGAS degradation via the proteasomal pathway; additionally, HSV\u20101 immediate early protein ICP0 may affect the stability and function of STING in certain cell types 71, 72. Other tegument proteins such as UL46 reportedly interfere with the function of cGAMP\u2010mediated STING by physically interacting with STING and its downstream kinase TBK1 73. HSV\u20101 ICP27, an immediate early protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses, may also interact with STING and TBK1, thus interfering with STING\u2010dependent signal activation 74. HSV\u20101 VP22, which is encoded by the UL49 gene, may also possess an antagonistic function against the cytosolic DNA\u2010sensing immune response through modulation of the enzymatic activity of cGAS 75. Deamidation impairs the ability of cGAS to catalyze cGAMP synthesis; additionally, it has been shown that HSV\u20101 UL37 tegument protein may promote cGAS deamidation, thus attenuating cGAMP\u2010mediated anti\u2010viral activity 76. Recent studies have demonstrated that HSV\u20101 may target transcription factors that are located downstream of the STING/TBK1 axis as part of its immune evasion strategy. In addition to the viral serine protease of HSV\u20101, VP24, some viral tegument proteins, such as UL24 and UL36, have evolved certain strategies to target IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB by negatively regulating them 77, 78, 79. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the \u03b334.5 gene of HSV\u20101 encodes a virulence factor for HSV\u20101\u2010mediated pathogenesis that may also act as an antagonistic factor against the cGAS/STING pathway 80, which is consistent with the finding that an HSV\u20101 mutant in which the \u03b334.5 gene has been deleted no longer exhibits an antagonistic function in infected cells, thereby facilitating IFN production in a STING\u2010dependent manner 26. On the other hand, an oncogenic herpesvirus, KHSV, which encodes viral interferon regulatory factor 1 gene, has been shown to prevent an association between STING and TBK1, thereby inhibiting initiation of IRF3\u2010mediated signal activation 81. The authors of this paper also identified five other KSHV\u2010encoded proteins that can suppress STING\u2010dependent signal activation. The LANA of KSHV has been shown to play a pivotal role in viral replication. Zhang and colleagues have also reported that N\u2010terminal truncated cytoplasmic isoforms of LANA may associate with cGAS directly, thus interfering with cGAS\u2010dependent signal activation 82. Moreover, MHV68 encoding DUB enzyme ORF64 (also referred to as a KSHV ORF52 homolog) has also been shown to suppress STING\u2010dependent signal activation 83. The mechanism responsible for this involves a DNA\u2010sensing process in a DUB activity\u2010dependent manner. Additionally, a KSHV\u2010encoded tegument protein, ORF52, has also been shown to antagonize cGAS function through its direct association with both cGAS and viral DNA 84. Furthermore, the authors of this paper showed that, in addition to MHV68, the homologs of ORF52 genes derived from Epstein\u2013Barr virus and Rhesus monkey rhadinovirus exhibit similar inhibitory functions targeting cGAS, suggesting that the antagonistic function of gamma herpesviruses is evolutionally conserved. Overall, these results indicated that herpesviruses may modulate the cytosolic DNA\u2010mediated immune response via an elaborate mechanism that involves viral encoding of several antagonistic genes.",

With regard to the cGAS/STING pathway, NS2B/NS3 protease of DENV was initially found to have a similar inhibitory evasion mechanism via proteolysis of human, but not murine, STING 89, 90, which is consistent with the observation that DENV replication is restricted in mice because DENV protease cannot cleave murine STING. Most recently, this conserved strategy for cleaving STING was also observed in other flavivirus NS2B/NS3 proteases derived from Zika virus, West Nile virus and JEV, but not YFV 91. Accordingly, there may be a non\u2010proteolytic mechanism for counteracting STING function by YFV\u2010encoded viral protease, as described above. It has also been proposed that the Zika virus may possess an alternative strategy for immune escape. Zika virus\u2010encoded NS1 protein has been shown to promote proteolysis of cGAS rather than STING through recruitment of caspase\u20101 activation, suggesting that Zika virus infection manipulates the interplay between the inflammasome and cGAS/STING pathways 92.

It remains to be determined whether other types of inflammatory diseases may also be associated with defects in cGAS/STING function (e.g., mediated by gain\u2010 or loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations). Thus, an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying overactivity of inflammation mediated via the cGAS/STING pathway could lead to design of potent therapeutic agents and strategies for overcoming undesirable inflammatory diseases and certain types of cancer. In addition, although the cGAS/STING pathway may contribute to detection and elimination of infection by both DNA and RNA viruses, over time these viruses have also evolved the ability to escape or manipulate this signal activation through several evasion strategies, as described above. Indeed, such manipulation is considered critical to the ability of viruses to establish both lytic and persistent infection and elicit characteristic pathogenesis. Further information on the non\u2010canonical mechanism of cGAS\u2010independent STING activation and the evasion strategies of RNA viruses will strongly facilitate understanding of the host\u2013pathogen interaction.

Finally, along with the accumulating insights regarding the cGAS/STING pathway and its involvement in virus\u2013host interactions, it is also important to better understand the loss of cGAS/STING function in some types of cancer or transformed cells by viral encoding oncoprotein.
